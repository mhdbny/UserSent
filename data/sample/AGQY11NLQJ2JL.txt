Adopting the story of operation "Mincemeat" from World War II, this movie shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance.Though an intriguing story, the performance seemed cold and boring. It just made me think that a great story has been ruined.

Lennie and George, migrant workers who move from farm to farm looking for work, are good friends despite their differences. In a cruel world, where loneliness and desperation rule, the two friends are joined by a special bond of a common dream. The dream of owning their own land wasn't a matter of a property, rather it was about a peaceful world where friends are totally devoted to each other's protection. In a sense; it is the family that Lennie and George never enjoyed.John Steinbeck explores deep subjects of existence and man's helplessness with a symbolic genius, reminiscent of Kafka's. Steinbeck used a simple story to depict weakness, loneliness, aging, desperation and existence. The dream was so profound and real that the world is incapable of understanding the emptiness that follows, when a dream is crushed.Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" is a fascinating emotional roller coaster that leaves the reader dizzy and flabbergasted. Most characters see their own dreams die in front of their eyes; the readers will be left with some critical moral questions unanswered.Since I read that book, I'm still pondering and re-examining George and Lennie's dream that existed to help them live in a harsh world, more so, than to achieve the dream itself. Dreams are what keep us going, so when they are aborted, regardless if we chose to or if we are forced, life will never be enjoyable again.

Are you fed up with the mindless bureaucracy of your workplace? nauseated with the importance of process over results? anxiety ridden because of your job? then Office Space is the movie for you. The setting for Office Space is an Information Technology company that processes transactions for Credit Unions, with a collection of employees that are all either bored, angry, aloof, incompetent, anxious or suffer from one of a hundred other maladies or neurotic manifestations. No doubt this sort of work environment will be familiar to most.It would be convenient to say that this is just another movie about how the corporate work environment drains us of our humanity, but Office Space offers us much more. The mindless bureaucracy, doing work solely to satisfy some inane process (PTS Reports), the sense of detachment from reality is eerily reminiscent of a Kafka novel. Lundberg, the boss, who is completely unaware of what his employees do and how they feel, endlessly repeats his mantra of ok, ok , while his employees become more and more stressed and unfulfilled.Peter, the lead character, undergoes a profound Peter Pan like psychological transformation after which he is no longer motivated to do his job. He comes and goes as he pleases and begins to openly express his true feelings about the job and the environment. His new relaxed attitude impresses the clueless consultants, with their prepackaged prescription for transforming the organization (i.e. reducing headcount), who have been brought in to fine tune the organization.Naturally, no story of this genre would be complete without a love connection between the main character and yet another troubled, trapped soul. Peter's love interest comes by way of a waitress at a nearby restaurant who fights conformity by wearing only the minimum pieces of flair on her uniform. She endures the endless questioning from her manager about why she wears only the minimum pieces of flair, when she is so clearly and simply trying to preserve some part of her humanity.The dam of self-control that held the employees in check finally begins to crack when Peter and two of his co-workers hatch a plot of revenge against the company. Of course their plot like everything else goes badly wrong, but in the end it seems that justice is served.You will laugh out loud, you may cry at times, but if this dark comedy does not send your mind and heart in search of your humanity, sadly you have missed the point.

Jude Fawley, is an orphan trapped in poverty and a narrow working class paradigm, but in spite of these limitations, he dreams of a scholarly life in the university town of Christminster.Jude is smitten by Arabella, who tricks him into marrying her. After a short time Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia. Shortly after Arabella leaves him, Jude moves to Christminster to pursue his dreams.While in Christminster he meets his cousin Sue. Jude had fallen in love with Sue when he first saw her picture. Now he is in Christminster where he can pursue his dreams of becoming a scholar and meeting Sue. The conversations between Sue and Jude, despite their differences, bring them closer together and they quickly become friends. Sue deflates Jude's dream when she marries the schoolmaster (the same man at the beginning of the book, who had promised Jude some books but never fulfilled his promise).Even after Arabella comes back into the picture, Sue and Jude get divorced from their respective spouses and live together without marriage. In the years that follow, because the couple is not married, they face a lot of difficulties and become social outcasts. In spite of their difficulties, they still love each other and the family they are raising together. An extremely tragic event shatters the family. The consuming guilt, brought on by the tragic event, leads Sue and Jude back to their former hated lives.It was a desperate try on Sue's part to say no to customs she didn't believe in, and a desperate try on Jude's part to live the peaceful life he wanted with the woman he loved, but just as life didn't grant him his dream of an education, Society denied him acceptance of the relationship he wanted with Sue. The shocking end was Hardy's way to convey his thoughts on love, sex and the institution of marriage, at a time when talking about love, sex, and criticizing the marriage constitution was taboo.Hardy was criticized for creating complex, overtly sexual characters like Sue and Jude who would act against established norms of marital and sexual behaviors. Sue, recognized her intellect but still used marriage as a way of having the career she wanted, She could not force herself to be attracted to her older husband, who was understanding and gave her a divorce, after which she was free to pursue Jude. Jude loved Sue deeply, but knowing that she was married, he still slept with Arabella, when she came back, because she was still his legal wife.Reading the entire 500 plus pages of Jude the Obscure was totally draining. The emotional torment that Jude experienced throughout his life left me depleted. Each and every person in Jude's life played a little role in aborting his dreams of happiness: the schoolmaster who didn't pay attention to a promising ambitious little boy, Arabella who was a totally self absorbed narcissistic woman, whose character along with Jude's character is clearly revealed during the pig killing ritual, Sue who truly loved Jude, but her love was a selfish love that was centered around her own demons of guilt and doubts. Even Jude's older son, was another extension to Jude's obscurity.In the end Jude became completely obscure to the people for whom he cared. I don't think Hardy himself totally understands the canvas he has painted and perhaps that is the reason Hardy turned to poem after Jude and wrote no other novels. It wasn't the controversy that took place in Great Britain and the United States over the scandalous nature of the book, which led him away from novels to poetry. But rather Hardy left part of his heart in Jude and was unable to retrieve it.

The movie Blow is based on the story of George Jung, who played a major role in the United States cocaine trade. Certainly, the movie authentically represents the cocaine trade, and the people that Jung dealt with, but it was not as loyal to the portrayal of Jung's emotional side (i.e. his obsession with women and sex, his strange habits, and his total pleasure seeking life style). Instead, Johnny Depp portrayed the role of a good hearted man with good values who got into the business as a result of being mistreated by life events. I couldn't help but bonding with, and relating to this supposedly bad character.Regardless of how faithful the movie depicted real life characters, I know that the moral lesson of crime and punishment was delivered through a wonderful touching acting of the entire cast.Johnny Depp and Ray Loitta delivered an amazing performance. The scene of the old father listening to a tape of his son's voice is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen. The love Jung has for his daughter and his suffering because of his absence from her life was very credibly delivered by Depp and little Emma RobertsThe final scene with Depp's introspection is very touching; I still remember his voice saying:"Through out my life, I gave pieces of my heart to people I loved, that I don't have enough of my heart to keep me living".I watched this movie at least 10 times since 2001 and I know it will remain one of my heart's dearest movies. Today, I made the surprising discovery on Wikipedia that Kristina Sunshine actually visited her father in jail after watching this movie. Now that the man is paying for his mistakes, it's really good to know that his daughter has decided to visit him before he dies.

Camus was well known for defending values of justice, freedom and human dignity, I don't think his great work "the stranger" was a negative portrayal of human life in any way. The stranger is simply Camus' way of presenting his philosophy of absurdity in a very artistic, logical way.Camus's absurdist philosophy implies that life has no rational meaning, and there isn't a rational reason for the order of events in this world, therefore existence itself is absurd, which of course would contradict all religious beliefs that there is a divine reason for everything that happens and that life itself is divine. However, Camus in pursuit of his absurdist philosophy never believed that the absence of meaning in our lives should push humans into despair and agony, rather he believed in humans dignity under the pressure of this indifferent world.The stranger, or the main character of the novel: Meursault, who lived in Algiers, (Algiers was a French colony, Albert Camus was born there) is an emotionally indifferent person, who moves through life reacting to no event, even his mother's death. Meursault doesn't believe in God and doesn't have any emotional attachment to anything or anybody. Meursault on the other hand is an honest person who doesn't lie about his feelings and tells it as he sees it; he's simply a person with no hidden agendas and no mysterious motives.Meursault's life exists as a series of random events with seemingly no logic to why or when the event occur, not even his marriage decision or the support that he gives to certain friends seem logical. For no clear motive or reason, Meursault commits a murder and is taken to prison. The trial that takes place in the second part of the book is the most intense and mentally engaging part of Camus' stranger.The main focus of the trial shifts radically from the murder to an analysis of Meursault's character: his atheism, his lack of emotions at his mom's funeral, his brief interactions with people he met at his mom's funeral and even his conversation with the priest who came to prison to redeem Meursault and ask him to take Jesus as his savior. The court is trying to find the reason behind this irrational crime, just like society and religion are trying to find reason behind irrational events of life.Meursault is sentenced to death and pressured again by the priest to choose religion before he dies. At this point, Meursault, who was never emotional about any thing in his life, becomes very emotional about his rejection of religion and accepts death as the only destiny awaiting all humans. Getting rid of all hope, and accepting death was the only conclusion that allowed Meursault his inner peace.At a time of intense intellectual confusion after the second world war, Camus is not to be blamed for thinking that existence was absurd, at a time where lives are being lost for no reason and religion was being misused all over the world for political ,controlling, and non spiritual reasons. If the reader is interested in philosophy, religion, or literature, the stranger is a fascinating journey into the human mind and an exploration of life's purpose.

Broken hearted Jane develops her "new cow theory" about men; meaning that a man prefers being with a new woman and will always dump the old one. Through the funny details of the movie and with friends' help (I won't ruin the pleasure of you finding out for yourself, by providing more details), Jane faces her pain and finds out that she can still find true love, the only analgesic for heartache.The idea of starting over and admitting that not all men are faulty is very refreshing. After all, we women are the delusional ones who insist on pretending that the frog we're kissing is a knight and we place him on a white horse, then we act shocked when we find out he is still a frog.The theme of the movie alone makes up for the cheesy performance and deserves 3 stars. Admittedly though, I am a shallow woman, and for the raw pleasure of seeing Hugh Jackman with his shirt off (even though he still looked great with his shirt on), I changed it to 4 stars.

I was curious about Enya when I first heard of her; due to my love to U2's music and knowing that Enya became Irland's second biggest musical export after U2 (she's from Irland, such a bad stereotype on my part).There's no way one's can deny her beautiful voice and remarkable style, but I came to think that all her music has the same redundant theme when it comes to lyrics or music.This album reached the top 10 in both the UK and the US, peaked at number 3 in Germany, won the Grammy award for best new age album for 2007, and I'm in disbelief and trying to understand what is so special about this album.The reason I'm giving it three stars is that she is a hard working artist with glorious presence on the stage(at least she's not winking at the audience and acting cheesy like il Divo boys). With the inimitable style she has, maybe it is expected to have a theme in all her albums, but the lyrics of this album don't measure up to the standards she had in her other albums and they are either too repetitive and empty or just beyond my mental capacity. I'll go with the first choice; the lyrics are repetitive and empty.

The Plague is another of Camus's magnificently constructed plots, a story created as a way to present his philosophy of life and existence.The novel is about a plague that sweeps the Algerian city of Oran. Characters deal with the plague and the imprisonment they face because of the disease in different ways, but all characters mature greatly along the way. Interestingly, the ethical, noble, and charismatic characters like Dr. Rieux and Tarrou-just like Camus-are atheist. Both characters think all humans are bound up with a destiny of death, and that their existence has no higher spiritual dimension.Another interesting transformation that Camus portrays is the religious point of view presented through Father Paneloux, who's explanation of the plague at the beginning was a punishment sent from God to the people of Oran for their sins, but when Father Paneloux sees innocent children are suffering, Paneloux's explanation of the plague changes to say it is a possible divine test from god of people's faith. Paneloux reaction when he got the disease was very predictable as a religious man. Even though, Camus always rejected religion, the way he dealt with Paneloux ending shows a tremendous respect to what humans choose to believe.The process of maturity transforms each character based on their ethics and morals. Again, Camus has an outstanding way of analyzing humans and existence.Not to ruin the pleasure of finding out; but the reader might enjoy the special reflections of Camus's own understanding of people on the development of Raymond Rambert, Joseph Grand, and Jean Tarrou. At the end of the novel Dr. Rieux, the narrator, presents a brilliant summary about human suffering and their ability to forget or ignore life's absurdity.

As always, Ledger shines. He plays the role of William Thatcher; a peasant who earns the title of a Knight. Subtlety disguised amidst all the semi funny movie scenes, is a message of love, friendship and loyalty. Today, as rarely as these values are displayed, it is satisfyingly refreshing to at least dream of them.In one of the final scenes, Thatcher says: "My pride is the only thing that they can't take from me", which most of us can relate to. It turns out that he has true, loyal friends, and true love, which is an anachronism in today's world, but why not dream?The promise of this movie infused with Ledger's passion and charisma, will plant in your mind beautiful dreams that you will forever cherish.

This is such a classic tale of love, heroism and self denial. It is a wonderfully constructed story of love and a tribute to the golden age of fine acting when beauty wasn't measured by exposed skin or sleazy performance.This is a must have classic, if not for the story, the performance, or the music, then for the love theme:"You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things applyAs time goes by, and when two lovers woo, they still say, "I love you", on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings"

Relesed in 1975, "One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" won all five major Academy Awards:best picture, best actor in lead role, best actress in lead role, best director, and best screenplay.An adaption of a 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, and filmed in the setting of the novel: Oregon State Hospital, this movie is not a love story or a romantic plot. Rather, this is a story of man's struggle in every society where dictatorship aborts dreams and dignities.A recidivist criminal, McMurphy, is transferred to a mental insitution instead of prison.As his trick to spend an easier sentence, McMurphy(played by Jack Nicholson) thought he can leave any time he wishes since he's perfectly sane. The cast of the mental patients was perfectly picked to show a submissive group of people that most of them chose this life and chose being in this asylum.I once read about a scientific experiment were researchers divided a large fish tank in half by putting a glass wall in the middle. A barracuda was put on one side of the tank and a mackerel on the other. The hungry barracuda tried to get the mackerel but smacked into the glass barrier. Again and again, the barracuda smacked the glass in its attempt to reach its dinner. Finally, realizing how futile its attempts were, the barracuda gave up. Researchers then removed the wall to see what would happen. Surprisingly, the barracuda made no new attempts to reach the mackerel. It eventually starved to death even though food was within easy reach.. The technical term for what happened is "learned helplessness". The barracuda had learned to be helpless from its many failed attempts to reach the other fish. When the barrier was removed, the barracuda continued to operate as if the glass wall was still there.This Learned helplessness is the best term to describe the patients of the asylem depicted in the movie. A group of people that couldn't change any thing in their devestating lives and chose to be in a place were things were pre-chosen for them any way. McMurphy , the charismatic rebel by nature, tried to stand up to the main authority represented by a tyrant called Nurse Ratched played outstandingly by Louise Fletcher. The confrontations between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched started to by funny and silly but developed to be tragically fatal as McMurphy finds out that Ratched don't only have the authority to control the patients physically and mentally, but also the authority to keep him in the insititution for ever and even permanantly disable him.The great acting will keep your heart ingaged while the story of a dream, friendship and the sense of belonging is being born among the guys. High prices are paid to reach a dream, but the dream will live while telling the story of:Wire, briar, limber-lockThree geese in a flockOne flew east, one flew westAnd one flew over the Cuckoo's nest.

A contemplative movie in which many questions are asked: Is Yemen a training ground for terrorists? Is Colonel Terry Childers a blood-thirsty murderer?! Or is he a hero defending his soldiers, and complying with the rules of engagement? What are the rules of engagement?An intriguing story, magnificently performed by a wonderful cast namely; Tommy Lee Jones and Guy Pearce but leaves many unanswered questions about what is just and who decides what is just.If rules of engagement were obeyed, which assumes we can define rules of engagement that don't tolerate double standards, many war crimes would've never happened. Sadly enough, we are living in a crazy world of double standards and self appointed superior nations that one should doubt the existence of rules of engagements nowadays.

The play's protagonist Jack makes up an imaginary brother called Earnest, who he uses as an excuse to get out of town and do what he likes, but is too embarrassed to admit he likes.Jack and Algernon are best friends, who amusingly get tangled in the web of being mistaken for Earnest and falling in love with women who are mesmerized by the name Earnest, which as Jack's object of affection Gwendolen puts it: "it inspires absolute confidence".The ladies, despite their fixation with Earnest's name, accept their loved ones, but will these two men give up the dream of being Earnest, and if they do, will society and other people accept the lie they made up?As expected, a forcibly happy ending will reveal an unexpected surprise about Jack and the made up character.If it wasn't Oscar Wilde's play, I would've asked, what are the odds? Given the playful plot and the masked serious topics like deception, double lives, hypocrisy and mainly the nature of marriage, I can accept some deviation from reality.The importance of being Earnest is a fun read, and a special sarcastic way of dealing with Victorian morals and values as Wilde perceived them. The play absolutely deserves all the attention it got and still gets.

Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism."The picture of Dorian Gray" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work.

I usually don't like teens' books that address one gender; I tried to be open minded about it but I refuse to think of boys and girls as two different species (even though evidence disproves me every day). I got this book as my way of exiting my state of denial about girls' problems being totally different than those of boys, I'm still in denial but the book is very sweet and charming. Written by a mother and daughter who went through life's difficulties together, it offers their precious advice and I think every mother and daughter will relate to that. Very well done!

In "the second sex", de Beauvoir is conducting research to determine how females came to occupy a subordinate social role to males; she turns to biology, historical materialism, and literature where she finds undeniable differences between men and women and countless examples, but no clear reason or justification for woman's implied inferiority.By walking us through the stages of female's life, de Beauvoir tries to prove that women are not born feminine but shaped by external forces into dependent inferior creatures, or as she put it in her own words:" One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman". Maternity caused society to label women and rob their individuality during youth. Labeling women and forcing them into certain roles inevitably results in women living lives of incompleteness and immanence. Age and the subsequent loss of reproductive ability ends woman's purpose and in turn her identity and usefulness.Great work, great research but the only reason I'm giving this work three stars is because of the mixed feelings I have about it: I agree with some of de Beauvoir's conclusions: the importance of financial independence for every woman, female character is a result of her situation not the opposite, the difficulty of breaking free from the myth of "femininity", and most importantly, women's own role in reinforcing their dependency and otherness. I strongly disagree though with the claim that being a mother or a wife are unfulfilling roles that exacerbate a woman's inferiority. For me, asking for absolute "equality" and taking away woman's motherhood is as cruel and dehumanizing as depriving females of subjectivity and turning them into objects.Not to criticize de Beauvoir's personal life, but her fixation with resisting the myth of feminine inferiority drove her to the extreme position, rejecting marriage and having kids. Even though de Beauvoir was committed to her relationship with Sartre, she didn't want to marry him and allowed him and herself marginal romantic encounters with males and females.The paradox of de Beauvoir loving some body and allowing herself to be with somebody else, to me, is as damaging as what she criticized in her work. It is exactly acting like the men she criticized for treating "the other sex" as objects.

In "The Problems of Philosophy", Russell attacks old problems with new logic; he introduces a number of schools of thought that preceded him and philosophic problems common to all philosophy such as: public and private experience, personal identity, self-consciousness and consciousness of other minds, relations of space and time, and knowledge itself.Russell examines our judgments about reality with an analytic approach. He uses a table, a simple physical object, and he follows Descartes' practice of radical doubt to analyze our knowledge of the physical world through sense data, which are the impressions that the appearance of reality offers our senses.While establishing a theory of knowledge, Russell makes the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. Russell also discusses priori knowledge with a Platonic attitude toward universals, considering the possibility of having acquaintance with a universal without knowing of a single instance of that universal.Through opposing idealism, discussing other philosophers' faults and discussing ideas and universals, Russell completely lost me and fell into the trap other philosophers couldn't avoid: going in endless circles to explain a simple aspect.I enjoy reading Russell's anti war ideas, his scientific work especially in Math, but when it comes to philosophy, Russell is not a straight shooter.

Utilitarianism is a moral theory based on the principle that "Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness."Mill sees happiness as humans' primary desire; hence, it is the basis for morality and justice. In defense of utilitarianism, Mill defines and tries to validate his position by relating justice and utility and arguing that happiness is the foundation of justice. While the whole argument can be presented in many ways, Mill tried to vindicate Utilitarianism from accusations such as: not protecting individual rights, measuring every thing in life with the same standard, and over simplifying happiness.From the man who once said: "Whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called", it seems that Mill ignored the absence of individuals' appreciation in utilitarianism. Knowing that Mill was raised in a strict utilitarian environment, and the mental struggle he went through to validate his theory is key to understanding this work. Instead of judging this work as a reasonable philosophical work, the reader should approach it as Mill's introspection through which he tried to justify his belief in utilitarianism.

"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself."-NietzscheNietzsche, the man who predicted the war and chaos that resulted from Europe's enthusiastic unchecked embrace of nihilism, is presenting the basics of his philosophy through Zarathustra.This mock-gospel, philosophical work is Nietzsche's criticism of mass movements or dogmas in general, and in particular he mocks the concept of a holy scripture through the story of Zarathustra. After ten years of solitude, Zarathustra, like a modern day Moses, descends from the mountain with the hope of teaching the people love and wisdom and helping them become ubermensch. . To become an ubermensch, one has to be free from all human prejudices, group moralities and create his/her own values and purpose.Zarathustra's teachings include the ubermensch or the enlightenment stage, the concept of will to power, the fear of the pointless eternal recurrence, and the understanding that mass movements are for the weak who can't think for themselves and as a result they take the easy escape route to religion, nationalism, democracy or some other movement.By the end of the day, Zarathustra is saddened by his inability to move this "herd" of people and decides to focus on those who choose to separate themselves from the "herd".Zarathustra ends up teaching his philosophy to people who choose to follow him and work toward achieving the ubermensch/overman stage. In "Beyond good and evil", Nietzsche covers the same ideas in more depth and completes this philosophical theory.Understandably, in a time when Christianity lost people's faith to Nihilism and science, Nietzsche like others, saw an urgency to restore faith and values, but unlike any other he tried to create a new set of faith and values.For the longest time Nietzsche was accused of being an atheist, but when the believers are acting contrary to the morals of their religions, only the courageous, such as Nietzsche, dare to question and seek the truth. Doubt is the road to faith just as uncertainty is the motive to search for truth. Nietzsche, the man who said: "In truth, there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross", wouldn't dismiss religion itself, only the practice of its adherents.Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which was written during a time of physical and emotional deterioration in Nietzsche's life, is as chaotic and unpredictable as his health. At a time, when humanity needed a moral code, Nietzsche's ideas were a bright beacon of hope that no one believed or understood, "Thus spoke Zarathustra." is indeed "A book for none and all".

This novel created considerable controversy, along with Freudian accusations of an Oedipal relationship between Paul the son and his mother Gertrude.D. H. Lawrence depicted the physical attraction between Paul and Clara in a very frank direct manner that was quite radical for the time. The tormenting uncertainty betweenPaul and Miriam, along with his strong attraction to Clara as compared to the mutual emotional dependency between him and his mother were understandably overwhelming to the public.It was very instructive to see how the absence of love in the mother's life led her to have an emotional dependency on one of her kids, only to switch to another son when she loses the first one. Portraying human narcissism through motherly love is a very shocking way of examining human nature. It was very interesting, as well, to see how the son was always torn between loving a woman and loving his mom, which are very different and incompatible emotions.Lawrence's honesty is very admirable considering the period in which the novel was written, and the unique way he described the son's decision while the mom is in pain on her death bed might raise some deep insight regarding this Author's vision. I, though, reject the possibility of a deep emotional thinker, and go with a merely honest portrayal of a pleasure worshipping male, who did not understand typical male desires as compared to typical human feelings.Lawrence had many admirers, including some smart/confused feminists, who thought of him as a great writer who portrayed quite accurately women's feelings. I, on the other hand, agree with the good writer part but sense in him shallowness and pure blind desire with a great dearth of complex analysis.

Slaughterhouse Five is the sad tale of Allied firebombing of Dresden, Germany during the Second World War. The Dresden bombing caused nearly the same number of deaths as the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.This novel is based on Kurt Vonnegut's own war experience and took him over two decades to finish it. Vonnegut is actually present as one of the characters; he was the constant cynical narrator who makes all deaths equivalent with his comment:" so it goes".Interestingly, the novel was published during the Vietnam War, a war where technology was again used against nonmilitary targets in an unjust war.Through the protagonist Billy Pilgrim, we are taken on a sad journey through the scarring traumatic horrors that war inflicts on both sides for generations to follow.Sarcastically, Vonnegut used the Tralfamadorians, who are aliens shaped as toilet plungers, to demonstrate the linear progression of time as opposed to all moments existing simultaneously. Through the Tralfamadorians, free will is also presented as the ultimate illusion; Beginning with Billy's childhood, free will is a repeated theme throughout the novel.Slaughterhouse-five, a remarkable novel that condemns war along with any bureaucratic attitudes that attempt to glorify war and its heroes, while ignoring its destructiveness and horrors.

This is such a fascinating and funny movie; what if we could go back in time? Would we choose differently or would we simply do it all over again?Zac Efron, I thought, was just a pretty boy, who was lucky to be in movies, but, I misjudged the book by its cover, he is such a talented and funny actor. Watch him in "17 again" as a middle aged man who gets to relive his youth and has a chance to rewrite his destiny. A smart and hilarious movie with a great cast of actors.

The cat's cradle is an extraordinary tale about the extent of human limitations when incompatibilities exist between the goals of science and humanity. Vonnegut created another masterpiece that describes the dangers of human science when mixed with their desires and lewdness.John, the narrator, is writing a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and in the process of his research discovers the life of Felix Hoenikker, the Nobel prize-winning physicist and one of the creators of the atomic bomb.Similar to walking through a hilarious human maze, we are taken to San Lorenzo; a town were Hoenikker's two sons and daughter live and ignorantly use their father's last invention causing another world wide human disaster.Vonnegut brilliantly shows human limitations and foolishness with his description of an imaginary religion called Bokononism, which originated and blossomed in San Lorenzo.Vonnegut, who survived the cruelty of war and faced life's emptiness, is one of the few writers who can laugh at the human inability to reconcile the inherent conflict of science's power and capabilities with the needs and limitations of humanity.

Raskolnikov, the main character in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, is presented as a pure nihilist. Dostoevsky, through his telling of Raskolnikov's inner struggle and his first encounter with love and compassion, is clearly rejecting nihilism. The murder committed by Raskolnikov might be an act related to utilitarianism, but the great agony and guilt that the main character suffers is Dostoevsky's idea of real punishment that leads the final conclusions that good beats evil, religion beats atheism, and right overpowers wrong.Granted, Crime and Punishment is considered great literature devoted to the psychology of criminals and their imprisonments within their own guilt. However, the novel is an immature way of stereotyping criminals and simplifying a very complex human puzzle. Dostoevsky attempts to show us that only love, redemption and righteousness will rule, but he over simplifies and generalizes.Crime and Punishment is another way that Dostoevsky tried to resolve his feelings about chaos and corruption in his society, and solve all dilemmas and conflicts by turning to God, or accepting Christ as Dostoevsky did in reality.

When the Social Contract was published in 1762, Rousseau became a wanted man in France and Switzerland, but in 1794 after the French revolution, his remains were buried in Paris as an international hero.In 1814, religious fundamentalists stole the remains of Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and dumped them in a pit full of quicklime, a cruel burial reserved for individuals condemned by the church.In the Social Contract, Rousseau postulates that a legitimate political authority in a civil society comes only from a social contract intended for their mutual preservation and agreed upon by all citizens (the sovereign). The sovereign that expresses the general will that aims at the common good has absolute authority over public matters. The state that is protecting citizens should follow laws of equality and liberty that are interestingly created by non-citizen lawgiver, and the state should also have a government to exercise executive power and daily business.The social contract might sound very basic, utopia like and naive to many readers but considering the political nature of that time and the topics debated such as liberty, free will, and the state of nature, this work is absolutely a rebellious scream, which was much needed at the time.Rousseau dreamed of a civil society, but given alone the way his remains were treated in 1814, it seems unlikely a civil society will ever exist. However, if we are not free in any way (or as Rousseau puts it: Man is born free, but he is everywhere in chains), we are still free to dream. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a free spirit who dared to dream, though imperfectly, had the courage to speak up; and for that alone his dream should be praised.

Even though Doetoevsky's underground man perceives himself as a deep, conscious, brilliant man, he still knows that he is skeptical of every thought or feeling he might have. He tries to convince himself of being smarter than any body he encounters, but in reality he has a deep feeling of inferiority that ultimately manages to isolate him from people and society.The underground man never had any experiences of love or emotional relationship, thus he relies in his youth on literature and drama where he gets high expectations of ideal relationships and morals. However, real life interactions and relationships traumatize him with reality that he doesn't know how to accept.In his forties, the underground man doesn't crave human interactions or attention any more, or have passionate ideas about any thing like he did in his youth, and he knows no other way than anger and bitterness to deal with people. Even though his intimidating way of dealing with people brings him humiliation and pain, he still enjoys thinking that he is practicing his free will. Ironically, the humiliation he brings down on himself is empowering and satisfying to the underground man. As long as he has choice and free will, he is still alive and active like others, regardless of the consequences of the choices he makes.Whether Dostoevsky wrote notes from Underground as a scream against rationalism and utopianism, or if he was symbolizing his own alienation from the modern Russian society, he just did a great job. Every detail in the book is worth reading.

In "Civil Disobedience" Thoreau presents political theories in which he dissects democracy and the interaction between citizens and their government.Understandably, Thoreau was deeply concerned about injustices he witnessed during his life, such as enslavement of one sixth of the population and the invasion of Mexico by the United States.Thoreau does not oppose the institution of government; he believes that when a government becomes "abused and perverted", it ceases to represent the will of the people. When a government makes decisions that promulgate harm and injustice, it is the duty of its citizens to rebel and break those chains of injustices.Arguably, the strongest idea Thoreau presents, is the notion of individualism. Thoreau encourages skepticism of the government and rejects blind loyalty to it. Thoreau perceives citizens, who give blind loyalty to their government's decisions without questioning them, as participants in every injustice committed by that government. Whether this point of view is correct or not, it is worth debating, especially in view of the horrific injustices that are extant in today's world and the way the masses so easily accept them without considering the negative impact on others.

If you want a magical transformation, this is not the workout for you. Actually, I think such a workout doesn't exist. This DVD is an intense and demanding 55 minutes of exercise that is very challenging, but it is worth it. Combine it with the ab boot camp and you will be hooked if you take the time to build your strength. Don't be discouraged if you have to stop to get some water or take a break, just keep moving and keep trying. You will be able to do it within 2 weeks and you will feel the empowerment that hard work and discipline offer you (that wasn't easy for me). Try "basic training boot camp" for three weeks before you attempt this advanced one and it will help build your strength and confidence.A side not: if you are mad, frustrated or disappointed, this workout will help you release some of the anger and transform it into positive energy!

My daughter's English teacher suggested this book for the seventh grade students. I was very curious and as usual tried to peek into my daughter's books claiming that I wanted to help; after reading the first chapter, I was completely hooked.As marvelous as the messages of this novel was, I was thrilled to see my child engage with the story as much as I did. "Freak the mighty" is a tale of friendship and acceptance between two friends Kevin and Max. The story is very profound but told in a very simple way that will captivate young readers, and pose many questions about the meaning of life, the finality of death, the value of true friendship and survival.No review will be as good as reading the novel.

"God is the mysterium tremendum that appears and overthrows, but he is also the mystery of the self-evident, nearer to me than my I."-Martin BuberThe basic assumption of Buber's philosophy is that man has two distinct ways of engaging the world:* The first mode (the mode of I-It) is the mode of experience. In experience, we are engaging the world as an objective observer rather than as a participant. Experience is the mode of science and philosophy, the mode through which we come to know things intellectually, and to put things to use for us. The object of experience (the It) is viewed as a thing to be utilized for some purpose. I and the experienced It: the one is the subject, and the other the object. In this relationship, the experiencing I is an objective observer rather than an active participant in this mode of engaging the world.* The second mode (the mode of I-You) is the mode of encounter, we enter into a relationship with the object encountered, we participate in something with that object, and both the I and the You are transformed by the relationship. The You we encounter is indulged in its entirety, not as a sum of its qualities, instead, it is encountered as if it were the entire universe, or rather, as if the entire universe somehow existed through the You.This "encounter can happen with any of the objects that we experience; but with another human the phenomena of encounter is best described as love. We can also, however, enter into encounter with a being that cannot be the object of experience: God.Western culture, according to Buber, has generally come to think that the first mode is the only mode available to human beings for engaging the world, as a result of this approach the modern man has come to feel alienated fundamentally because modern society is exclusively an It-world. We live in a world that strictly relies on experience not encounter. The only solution to modern man's woes is a true fulfilling community that can only be built by making proper use of the neglected second mode of engaging the world, and by using this mode to relate to God.Human alienation is a result of the emptiness we encounter with humans, where we feel that there could be something more, something more lasting and more fulfilling. This "more" is encounter with God, or absolute revelationThis divine revelation is the only salvation for humans, the only feeling that canKeep them from feeling the emptiness and loneliness associated with human kind. Once this revelation is achieved, we can deal with anything and anybody as you, and this transformation will give each human a sense of compassionate responsibility toward all others.All Buber's conclusions seem reasonable and plausible to me except for him joining Zionism in 1897. While I don't understand how Zionism is related to the needed compassionate revelation of humans, I'm glad that I took the time to understand how one of the main Jewish religious thinkers analyzed the world. It was time well spent.

In this collection of great essays, Isaiah Berlin examines the development of Russian intelligentsia; the circumstances that surrounded the formation of Russian philosophy and the role of ideas in the history of philosophy.In one of the most enjoyable essays "the fox and the hedgehog", Berlin divides writers and thinkers into these two categories and focuses on Tolstoy's theory of history. My favorite subject is Russian philosophy and Berlin examines in great detail how Russian philosophers enriched and contributed to philosophy in Europe and the world.Admittedly, Berlin's writing and thoughts are sometimes difficult to follow and the reader has to pause frequently to digest Berlin's big intellectual morsels. The most rewarding accomplishment my struggle with the small print in this book is that it increased my understanding of Russian philosophers, or as Berlin describes them: "Philosophers are adults who persist in asking childish questions."

"Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward." Kurt VonnegutOn a mission to prove that Eliot Rosewater is legally insane, an attorney named Mushari is investigating Eliot's life, relationships, and actions. Between Eliot's strange relationship with his French wife, his drunkenness, and his overwhelming generosity, one can't tell if Eliot is insane or the world around him is insane.Vonnegut captures with great skill Eliot's sarcastic ideas and extremely dark, but funny jokes. At one point Eliot reads about the bombing of Dresden and his reaction is an expected outcome to the story and representative of Vonnegut's personal confrontation with one of the most important incidents of his own life.As Vonnegut writes in: "A Man without a Country": "Humor is an almost physiological response to fear.", the scattered stories of Eliot's interactions with the world describe the world's craziness with a loud laughing fear. "God bless you Mr. Rosewater" is another fabulous book by a gifted writer.

Using footage from the 1976 movie "Tiger and Crane Fist", Steve Oedekerk creates a new plot, by inserting new footage and inserting him self in original footage.As serious as the new plot is: about a man who lives his life looking for the evil man who killed his family when he was only a baby, Oedekerk manages to make it an extremely silly and hilarious movie.I remember watching the movie 10 years ago and using it as the source of our silly inside jokes. Watching it again recently, it is still as funny as always, it's a timeless comedy!

Other reviewers did a great job of telling the story of this fabulous work; simply an East German Stasi officer (Ulrich Muhe) goes through awakening and transformation while spying on a successful author (Sebastian Koch) and his actress/girlfriend (Martina Gedack).I don't have much to enhance the retelling of the story. I found out by reading other reviews that Florien Hinkle von Donnersmarck is a first time director, which added to my fascination with this collectively successful work.Aside from the magnificent performance by Ulrich Muhe, whose death is a big loss to cinema every where, I could not help but notice the smart selection of actors. Koch and Gedack are both attractive people who actually know how to act, which is a real change from the usual Hollywood package of beauty and scant talent. Cars, furniture, interrogation room and even monitoring equipment comfortably belonged to the era of the movie (5 years before the fall of Berlin Wall). I was amazed how similar the electrical wiring of the door bells to those in other parts of the world were totalitarian governments ruled.Other reviewers understandably noted some unrealistic points, for instance, if Weisler/Ulrich Muhe was such a good person, he would not be a Stasi officer to start with, or how impossible it is to get away with what he did under such an oppressive regimen. I, on the other hand, think it is very understandable for somebody experienced with the system to know how to clean up after him self. The character, also, showed a loyal honest belief in the system that he swore to protect in addition to his strict and semi/robotic professionalism. Weisler's transformation did not materialize out of no where; he unlike his school friend/boss chose to be an educator(or so he thought) in the Stasi academy, He was opposed to spying on people for reasons other than protecting the system, and he also longed for love and passion (even with a prostitute). Weisler simply is every person, with good and bad qualities, who has the courage to question himself and make choices. In reality, similar totalitarian governments would not even try to dig for evidence against Dreyman, they could simply have him vanish, without explanation, to some prisons (hint, hint).Irrespective of the director and writer's vision, I'm still saddened by how similar governments around the world pilfer good ideas and transform them into their own corrupt systems. Stasi was the East German name of a sick system that has different names in different parts of our world. If only Marx knew how his ideas would be used to help one group enslave another. If only we all understood that books and religions can be used to enslave us as well as free us.I'm amazed by this movie, what adds to my amazement is how much this master piece has been understood and appreciated by so many people. It seems like there is still hope; I'm grateful I was introduced to this movie.

On a rain filled weekend, I introduced Safina's album to my family. Driving while watching the rain and replaying CANTO LA VITA was very enjoyable and peaceful, but then we heard "You Come to My Senses", we were overwhelmingly charmed by his voice that the accent has to be overlooked.I expected some excitement but not my 11 years old daughter's reaction, she announced Safina as her favorite singer among all my musical icons. I, on the other hand, don't think I will go that far, I will just give him a spot next to the best of the best.

To all but the music barbarian, it is axiomatic that the music of Chopin and Puccini is exceptional. An exceptional musician can perform pieces such as, "O MIO BABBINO CARO" and "NOCTURNE", in a way that showers us with unexpected and previously unknown pleasure.I have never experienced a performance of "CAST A AIVA" as spectacular as Joshua Bell's. I still can't decide what piece on this album is my favorite.Each piece is a well known great melody, but with Bell combining them all on one album, he left his unique touch. You can hear his soul flow passionately and beautifully from the strings of his instrument. I was left asking my self, is he making love with his violin or is he only making music?

This is the story of Joe Bonham, a young American man, who was dragged to a war that he didn't understand. Injured, paralyzed, and without all but his sense of touch, Joe tries to figure out what happened to him and how to communicate with a world that doesn't see or understand his suffering. Joe's intense, but intriguing journey through his own mind to the ultimate political maturity is amazing.This novel was written over 60 years ago, and it is still relevant to this crazy time of wars, dragging young men into blind killing orgies and splitting people into those blindly loyal to their government, and shocked betrayed citizens. You will want to explore this novel, enjoy the great ideas behind small symbols and ponder the image of a rat eating the face of a dead soldier. Rats and big parties are the only beneficiaries of war.This is a timeless master piece laying bare that monstrous invention of humanity, WAR

The performance of Binoche and Finness in Wuthering Heights was amazingly powerful. People often criticize the movie, but, I believe, the director was extraordinarily faithful to the original story. All criticism was directed at how sadistic Heathcliff(Ralph Fiennes) was towards everybody. It is the director's right to add or omit whatever he finds necessary to make a movie version of the book. In this case, the director's choice was to have the characters semi identical to the book's original ones.It's very simple, if you loved the novel, you would love the movie and forgive the portions that were omitted, and admire the total focus on Heathcliff's anger, and evil side. It's not the movie/director/actors' fault that the novel original characters are actually defected, imperfect human beings.Even though Wuthering Heights is a great piece of literature, a wild emotional story that is written in a fascinating way, the characters always puzzled me. If everybody is calling Heathcliff a sadistic crazy man, what then is Catherine? I believe that Catherine is even more sadistic and cruel than any other character in the novel.Catharine was completely engaged in self worship and didn't care about any other human being. The only thing she loved about Heathcliff was his love and devotion to her. She enjoyed breaking his heart, breaking her husband's heart, and enjoyed torturing Edgar's sister with her sense of entitlement to Heathcliff and his love."..Why did you betray your heart Catherine?....I forgive my murderer, but yours, I will never forgive..." yeah, Fiennes got to me saying these words, but for the love of God, how delusional can people be? Nobody broke Heathcliff's heart but his Catherine, and no one killed Catherine.Five stars, to Wuthering Heights for its timeless depiction of human dark side, and when I say dark side, I mean every character in the movie except Catharine the daughter. To me, Catharine the daughter is the only character with some common sense and virtue. I would give more than five stars to the movie if possible, simply because Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche captured so well, the darkest side of love and selfishness as the stars of a great novel.

Every time I watch a movie that is based on a book, I can't help but thinking that it just can't be fair to the book itself. There will always be a way or another to minimize either the story or the characters. Based on the book by Josephine Hart, this movie is actually enhancing the book in so many ways.I saw the movie 14 years ago, when it was heavily criticized for the sexual scenes, the nudity, and the lack of dialogue. I loved it then and I come to love it even more now.In the book, the focus was on the emotional struggle that the main male character (Stephen Fleming) was going through. He lived all of his life being the good family man, good provider, simply playing it safe by the rules, until he meets Anna, the mysterious girl friend of his son. That's when he looses control and gets torn apart between his strong desire to have that woman and his sincere love to his kids.Anna would strike you as the cold, mysterious, kind of evil person who might have some emotional side to her, but it's focused on her selfishness and total consumption into her own emotional damage.Now, when Jeremy Irons is playing Stephen, and Juliette Binoche is playing Anna, the story was taken to a different level, where dialogue is not needed much to show the development of the characters.Binoche with the short hair cut, innocent yet very pretty face, and piercing looks is definitely making Anna the irresistible, mysterious, semi evil woman.Irons simply can show with his eyes the entire struggle and pain that Stephen is going through; I don't think any other actor could've played that role.The sexual scenes were way deeper than mere sexual attraction. I don't understand why they were criticized that much over the years, while the porn industry was blooming. The love scenes mostly focused on the two actors' faces and didn't show much skin as critics would say. The love making didn't focus on sex as much as on the desire of that man to bosses that woman in every way, and on the total physical submission she gave him, while at the same time she didn't give him her whole self.I don't want to ruin the plot for any body who's interested in watching the movie, but try to focus on Irons' facial expressions, on the scene after the public love making in France where he goes back to his room and lays crying on the bed, on the scene when he's naked holding his son, and on the final scene and its details("...she was no different than any body else").With two great actors like Irons and Binoche, you might be distracted from the other great actors like Martin (the son), Ingrid (the wife). Great movie, great music, great director BUT if you are a righteous person you might not like it; if you are a religious righteous person you will hate it (it might put you in confrontation with some puzzles about life and human limitations, that I highly doubt righteous people will understand).

A detailed review of this movie might ruin the pleasure of discovering how each character makes the choice between acting morally or simply walking away and doing nothing.The movie elucidates legal rendition used by the United States, where suspects are taken into US custody but delivered to a third-party state. Torture by proxy is the most abhorrent form of torture, because it frees you from direct involvement in what is being done to another person.Since 9/11, the CIA has reportedly launched an investigation into such cases of "erroneous rendition" where suspects were subject to rendition, confessed to crimes they didn't commit and were later found to be innocent civilians.The subject of rendition in this movie is a wrongfully accused Egyptian born engineer (Omar Metwally), who lives in the United States with his wife (Reese Witherspoon) and child.For the first time in his life, CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) watches this torture, led by Fawal (Yiqal Naor, who gracefully played Saddam Husain in "House of Saddam"), and chooses to take a moral stand despite his boss's disapproval. At the same time, in juxtaposition to the torture event, a young suicide bomber, under the powerful control of a terrorist group, makes his own moral choice.Great performances and a great story, enhanced by the presence of Meryl Streep and Yiqal Naor. Some might find the idea of a CIA member standing up to his bosses or a suicide bomber saying no to his recruiters incredible. In real life both people might not survive, but I believe that some hope still exist and the duty of the director and the movie is to propose the possibility of hope.Is the idea of hero who dares to change things, merely a dream? Perhaps, but it's a grand dream!

I normally pick any movie with Ray Fiennes in it for the pure, simple pleasure of watching his great talent portray an outstanding good or an ultimate evil character. As always, along the way of enjoying Fiennes' great acting, I discover other great actors. This time with this movie, I was pleased to discover the awesome talents of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two hit men in hiding. The two men are hiding in Bruges as a punishment for something that went wrong with one of their operations, and waiting for further instructions from Fiennes, their boss.The plot seems very simple, but the moral questions that you are left to contemplate after watching this movie is the real emotional gain or maybe the mental torture that endures.The guilt feelings that some people are blessed to live with or others are even more blessed to never experience are some of the emotional/moral topics explored in this movie. What is more challenging and potentially devastating is the judgment of other people over the choices or mistakes we made. How morally justified these judges are and who made them Gods on earth to judge others. Most importantly, what is a crime and what is not? What is a sin and what is not? This is a special movie that is far deeper than most of us are willing to think. enjoy!

I read this novel 20 years ago and was fascinated with Dostoevsky's ability to portray the inner human conflicts of his countless characters. Reading it again, I'm still fascinated by Dostoevsky's outstanding ability to describe human confrontation with mortality, agony, and the burden of choice. However, now I have a new understanding of Dostoevsky's philosophy.Understandably, and due to the political, emotional, religious and social crisis that Dostoevsky witnessed during his life, he arrived at a point where he rejected radical socialists' positions and all the philosophical concepts popular in Russia at the time, and moved to a conservative position of concern for traditional and religious values.During my life's journey of trying to comprehend and understand Dostoevsky, I came to believe that all his work, with the exception of Notes from Underground, was too predictable. He describes an avalanche of human emotional mysteries and takes the reader on a tragic roll coaster ride that will peak and end in either symbolic or an over simplified answer, both of which stand for one concept: humans are doomed, truth is mysterious, turn to God and you'll be saved. In my immaturity, I thought that Dostoevsky did his part to search for truth and the meaning of life, and consistently forces his novels to this conclusion. In particular, the arrogance of his definitive righteousness that he displayed in his last few books was starting to get on my nerves.After reading the Brothers Karamazov the second time, I came to a different understanding of Dostoevsky's passionate literature. The characters in The Brothers Karamazov were actually more mature than Dostoevsky's previous characters, and instead of Dostoevsky's typical tragic and hopeless conclusion, there is actually an objective, optimistic, non righteous view of human kind's nature.Granted, Dostoevsky still portrayed the hero-Alyosha-as a true loving self denying person, but without the over dramatic craziness that his characters previously had. The other semi-corrupt characters like Dmitri, Ivan, Grushka, and Smerdyakov were realistic enough and displayed both dark and bright sides. Particularly, Ivan was a great character that Dostoevsky used to display his thoughts about atheism, morality and the way he sees free will as a curse. Even though Dostoevsky obviously wanted to disagree with Ivan's debates about God and mortality, he was less definitive in this novel about who's righteous and who's bad.Now, I feel that Dostoevsky never found his true inner peace. After all, he was always torn between his desires, addictions, and obsessive love to the woman that tormented him, Suslova. Maybe, the righteous answer that Dostoevsky forcibly wanted for all his characters problems is, in fact, his own dream of a salvation that could never been achieved during his life.I might be wrong in both my assumptions, but The brothers Karamazov is a well written masterpiece regardless of the author's hidden messages.

I was never a big fan of Bill Murray, but when his comedic abilities are used perfectly to portray the ultimate cynical stranger, a great actor is revealed.Murray and Johansson are two strangers faced with life's emptiness in Japan who bond as two spirits, two friends and maybe more! The question remains; if you are a stranger everywhere, does it make a difference what country you are in???This is a very smart and deep movie that will leave you wondering, do you know yourself well enough? Do things still upset you like before? Highly recommended!

Critics might agree or disagree with Virginia Woolf, based on the degree to which they perceive her as threatening or unstable.Whether Woolf is portraying a feminist view or not in her "A Room of One's Own"; she is outstandingly candid and honest about the way she's perceiving life.I agree with a few great points that Woolf raised for example:1. As Woolf puts it in her own words: "intellectual freedom depends upon material things". No one who's financially dependent can have the freedom to explore any intellectual versions.2-One of most Woolf's fascinating opinions is her view of the subjective nature of truth. When a subject is highly controversial, no one can actually tell the truth, but simply defend her or his opinion and how they arrived at their opinion. Each person's reality simply depends on the circumstances and experiences they encountered, therefore, no reality is absolutely objective.In that way, Woolf insinuates that all the truth she presented in her book is questionable, just a very interesting way of dealing with any controversial matter.I strongly disagree that these points or ideas apply only to females. I think, they apply to every human being, but because of Woolf's own experience as a female, I believe she had to apply them to only females.

What an intriguing idea for a story, a man and woman meet, fall in love, fall out of love, have their memories of the whole love experience erased from their memories by a reverse brain mapping process. Who among us would not jump at the possibility of erasing painful or unpleasant memories and then be able move on with our lives with no recollection of anything associated with the person we had wiped from our memory.The lead characters in the story Joel and Clementine meet and fall and love, but after a period of few years they have drifted apart. Clementine discovers a doctor, who offers a service where he can erase memories of a particular person from your mind. Part of the process of forgetting is remembering. In order to map all the areas of the brain where the memories reside; the person wanting to forget has to collect all items associated with the person they are trying to forget. These items are shown to the individual, who is trying to forget and as they view the object a map of brain's reaction to the stimulus is created. Through the marvel of modern science this brain map is then used to execute a pinpoint destruction of the memories. Clementine successfully undergoes this procedure and completely erases any memories of Joel. Presumably, she is now free of the pain of a failed relationship. Joel is now a complete stranger to Clementine.Later, Joel is told by a friend that Clementine has had all memories of him erased and he becomes interested in doing the same with his memories of Clementine. We are then treated to the spectacle of Joel having all memories of Clementine zapped. The erasing is done while Joel is sleeping and the "technicians" drink, party and mess around during the process, in a startling display of indifference to what is being done to this person. Perhaps this is an indictment against the medical community that treats our mental anguish and discomfort with drugs or other means with a sort of detachment from what other damage may be inflicted on the individual.As we watch Joel's memories disappearing, through the use of clever cinematographic techniques, we see that Joel is desperately trying to keep the memories that are being removed. Other memories from his childhood become more vivid and we can clearly see that all his memories work together to create the person that is Joel. That is, I think, the precautionary tale of this film. We can not as humans selectively erase bad or painful memories from our minds without having an impact on our overall psyche. We may lose some pain, but we may also give up a piece of our soul or our being when we try to block out the bad and keep only the good. Our memories are complex and twisted and tied together in ways we do not fully comprehend, so be careful when you hit the erase button and enjoy the movie it will create its own map

In "the History of Sexuality", Foucault tried to use Nietzsche's genealogical approach that views concepts as changing constantly to fit the needs and provocations over time. Nietzsche used the genealogical approach gracefully in Beyond Good and Evil, and though I'm not completely convinced his ideas are correct; the gracefulness of his argument, and his personal experience with the chaotic political and moral nature of the European society he reacted to, form a compelling argument for his genealogical theory.Foucault mocked Nietzsche's approach but prematurely formulated his "repressive hypothesis" of thinking by which concepts result from the inexorable avalanche of history, and that sexuality has been repressed throughout our political history, therefore the only way to political liberation is sexual liberation.A side note: Foucault's "The History of Sexuality" is one of the basic justifications for the queer theory that proclaims the intersection between politics, sexuality, and gender. The whole normals vs. abnormal arguments are pointless and vague, as no one can tell what is normal or abnormal in the world. The arguments presented make no sense to me, are too relativist and do not rely on any scientific reason. It is a world devoid of absolutes where we must assume that anything and everything is permissible. This queer thinking recalls my college years, when I was irritated by new societies such as "The Society of Women Engineers" and the "The Society of Black Engineers". Next we will have" The Society of Queer Engineers" and "The Society of Tall Engineers'. What happened to treating humans as humans, who share life regardless of their gender, color or physical appearance? How can we ask for equality between genders when we defeat the whole purpose by being feminists or some other separate group?Back to "The History of Sexuality", Foucault reviews history to find out why our sexuality became the key to unlocking the truth about us, and arrives at the relationship sex has with power and knowledge. Foucault traces the emergence of sexuality to the seventeenth century, when the Christian emphasis on sins of the flesh led to an increasing awareness of sexuality in family relations. His road to the genesis of human sexuality ends with the bourgeois of the nineteenth century, who effectively invented what we think of as "sexuality," and used it as a way of protecting and separating themselves from the other groups. Foucault acknowledges that sex is not our essence, but rather it is a social construct that makes it easier to control humans. Here Foucault didn't provide any definite prove to his theory. It even sounds more convincing that the opposite is the truth: Sex and all its biological drives are an essential part of our nature and, therefore, it makes us more susceptible to control.The point Foucault tried to make in many lengthy ways is that how we understand certain concepts has a lot to do with what other concepts we link them to, and in this thought construct, sexuality is not a concept as much as means of linking concepts to each other. Foucault strong, initial argument that our sexual desires or behaviors themselves do not express profound truths about us, rather it is the discourse we have built up around those desires and behaviors that suggest the profound truth. These discourses are not fixed and changeable with time and needs. The growing importance of sexuality in our society reflects the fact that we have found more and more concepts that we can connect through sexuality, and in this way the "deployment of sexuality" is the way that we use sexuality to join different concepts. The history of sexuality is a history of class dominance, where sexuality is a social construct that can be used to link power and knowledge to sex in a variety of different ways.Finally, Foucault arrives at the conclusion that human life (and its aspects including sexuality) throughout history came to fall under the control of politics, where "bio power" or the new power over life controls life through the discipline of the body and through the regulation of population. It's beyond me how Foucault arrived at this conclusion while discussing how wars got fiercer than ever, how the death penalty became a safeguard not an act of destruction, and how power seems now to control life and population.I suspect that Foucault, through his arguments, wanted to weaken the concept of sexuality. By simply calling it a social construction, he will weaken the political powers themselves. I also suspect by the way that Foucault identified the four centers that have power and knowledge related to sex(hysterization of women's bodies, pedagogization of children's sex, socialization of procreative behavior, and psychiatrization of perverse pleasure) that he was trying to differentiate by what is socially considered a normal behavior and what is not. This is again a losing argument since it's purely a personal way of looking at things.As a big fan of Nietzsche (his method of debate not his actual ideas), I don't think that Foucault even came close to Nietzsche's genealogical approach. Foucault took a very exciting topic and managed to destroy his argument with a lengthy complicated delivery, the biggest problem with some philosophers is that they are trying so hard to be original that they overlook the obvious or they wrap it up in such a complex knot you can't possibly untie it. .

I was warned about the horribly tragic theme of this novel, but I fell in love with "Of Mice and Men", so I decided to crack open the shell and grab The Pearl as well.Admittedly, the sadness and sense of hopelessness of human dreams, similar to that found in "Of Mice and Men" pervades this novel. If you want to read something fun and light, then this novel is not for you and John Steinbeck is not the author for you.The plot is simple, like other Steinbeck's novels, but the emotional journey the heart and mind takes with this novel has no equal. "The Pearl" is yet another Steinbeck masterpiece, worth exploring time and time again.

I always thought of the ladies of s.... and the city as narcissistic, rich, spoiled, old brats, and I would only watch them if I was totally desperate and wanted to fall asleep (or if Mr. Big was gracing a scene with his presence). Therefore; watching the movie on HBO on another desperate boring evening was a pleasant surprise.The ladies, against all odds, did a good job and celebrated the theme of love and friendship in a very classy way.The movie, the acting, the theme of love, family, humanity, vulnerability and friendship was grand. I would watch it again!

Sonny and Gunner are two recently discharged Korean War veterans, who meet on their way back home. In his depiction of the growing friendship between the two young men and the inner world of Sonny, Wakefield playfully describes the two young men's journey in search of themselves, while hilariously describing the limited male mentality and overactive sex drive that is the primary focus of so many young men.Like his friend Vonnegut; Wakefield is brilliantly sarcastic and funny. I can imagine him smiling the same sarcastic, smart smile that Vonnegut flashes.Admittedly, I'm not a big fiction fan, but this novel is immensely entertaining and intriguing.

Dostoevsky's messiah, prince Myshkin, cannot save the corrupt world he enters. In a dark world that is torn apart by desire, money and chaos, Myshkin's compassion didn't save the sinners he cared for; rather it pushed them to complete and total destruction. In the end, Myshkin's failure forced him into despair and insanity.Dostoevsky, strongly represents his personal beliefs in "the idiot": discussing religion as feelings instead of rules and rituals, expressing beauty as "enigma" that can't be defined, interacting with sinners and adulterers. Also, Myshkin, like Dostoevsky, suffered from epilepsy.Unlike critics, I like to think of Dostoevsky as much deeper than just portraying his idiot as the perfect messiah, while portraying all others as sinners:-Even though, Myshkin was portrayed as the light and Rogozhin as the dark; Rogozhin is the person who was devoted to one woman, while Myshkin is the one who was torn between his romantic love of Agalya and compassionate love of Nastassya.-Even though Myshkin perceived Agalya as the light of his soul, he couldn't be strong for her when she demanded that he choose between her and Nastassya.-Despite Myshkin idealism, he received some pleasure from his self denial and exemplary meekness and humility. He wanted to be different, but could not resist giving into his strong attraction to the dark tempting beauty of Nastassya. Typical man, chasing the pray gets more enticing when it tries to escape, even back in 1867.-Good and evil had a confrontation more than once just like Myshkin and Rogozhin, but they both couldn't win and achieve their happiness. Was the confrontation a simple nave struggle over Nastassya or was Dostoevsky portraying his own inner hell and his desperate love in real life to Suslova?Maybe Dostoevsky didn't have all the answers to these weighty questions, but in the idiot he insinuated that the moral decay of society is not a stand alone aspect, and that humans are not merely victims. The corruption and chaos in the idiot's society was a result of the moral corruption of the characters themselves and the choices they made.

If you are an actor/actress and are offered a role in such a movie, then it's a sign that your career is going down!In short, an old lady cast a spell on a bank employee who refuses to extend her another chance to keep her house. Yeah, there is surprising scenes of the old lady throwing up on different occasions and sucking on her chin after losing her dentures, so in short it's kind of disgusting not suspenseful.I suggest that you don't bug us old ladies, and most importantly don't use us in stupid movies!

During my teen years, we didn't have the songs of Britney Spears and Fifty cent (I still can't tell who's who), but we listened to "one more night", and "groovy kind of love" by Phil Collins. We listened to real artists like Sade, Simply Red and others, who sang love songs, not self indulgent songs about their milk shakes and going to the candy shop.This album is a collection of love songs that were mostly written/co-written by Phil Collins and it is filled with lovely, touching words and moving music. Also, the album includes many great songs that never became hits such as: "Least you can do", "I've forgotten every thing", "tearing and breaking", "I can't stop loving you", and "if leaving me is easy".It's a must have album.

I had previously read translated versions of Hamlet, but I discovered that nothing compares to reading it in the original English. Shakespeare's words are an art form without equal, exquisitely mixed with a story of human anguish and emotional struggle.No staging of this work or great movie of the play can replace reading the play word by word. Admittedly, reading the play is intense and difficult work, but the joy of the journey is quite worth the pain. The charm of the language is equal to the complexity of the story. The genius of this work is not the language alone, but the mastery of describing Hamlet's inner hell. Personally, I think Ophelia was another tortured soul on whom Shakespeare showered extra attention to describe her suffering.This work doesn't need my modest praise; Read this master piece!

Don't be discouraged by the slow pace of the movie. You need to keep in mind when this movie was made and the theories of existence in vogue at the time. Bruno Ganz shines as an angel who listens to peoples' introspection and gets intrigued by the emotions that only humans experience.Once Henry Van Dyke said:"Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but those who love, time is eternity." So will the angel Will the Angel choose eternity in heaven or eternity through love? The journey is yours to discover and it is worth the time!

The movie is about a couple who are terrorized by strangers when staying in a motel. True, many scenes are unbelievable, but not more unbelievable than reality TV; you will be mystified as to why the evil people can't break the door or how the screw driver got in the car ignition, but that shouldn't be a problem in scary movies, because they are by definition somewhat detached from reality! I enjoyed it because it wasn't filled disgusting scenes and it was suspenseful enough. Good movie but not perfect, like most of us viewers!

Humans that are deprived of one or more of the senses naturally compensate by focusing and overdeveloping the remaining senses. Suskind brilliantly chose to deprive Grenouille of something other than senses, the ability to be recognized. I don't believe any human in history had a complete absence of a body scent, whether it's a pleasant or unpleasant one; we all associate places, loved ones, memories and incidents with special scents.Jean Baptiste Grenouille was born a strange baby who lacked a body scent and emitted a freaky feeling to every body around him, so much so, that even his "mother" tried to get rid of him soon after his birth.Surprisingly, baby Grenouille survives all the hardships associated with growing up poor in an orphanage, deprived of any human affection. The one thing that guided Jean Babtiste was his sense of smell; scents were burned in to his mind and could easily compare them with other scents he remembered and he could easily tell the source of a smell from a far distance. Through pure coincidence Grenouille landed a job with Baldini, a Parisian perfumer, where he was able to mix scents and experiment using his unique sense of smell to make great new scents. Grenouille's mind had no other focus but organizing and inventing perfumes.One day, Grenouille was attracted to a lovely new scent that led him to a red headed virgin. He tried to capture the scent and accidentally killed her. The scent vanished shortly after the girl's death, and now Grenouille is on a mission to find a way to keep the lovely scents associated with beautiful pre-pubertal girls.Grenouille embarks on scent focused research, fed like a monster by his desire to capture the perfect scent. Grenouille goes on a killing spree, capturing one scent after another and finally creates the perfect perfume that elicits all kind of affectionate and emotional reactions in people.The shocking ending will take place when Grenouille finally gets the attention he wants.Suskind created a work of great artistry, taking the reader to the 18th century streets of Paris. He painted a very vivid picture of the dirty Parisian streets, the lovely world of scents and the weird mind of a killer.Still, Suskind's genius isn't in his descriptions of the chaotic corrupt life in France prior to the revolution, or in the detailed depiction of art of perfume manufacturing. Rather, Suskind managed to separate himself from the villain of his story in a way that even Dostoyevsky did not achieve in "Crime and Punishment".From my personal research into the psychology of serial killers, I concluded that they are very focused on their own pleasure and don't actually feel the pain they inflict on others. A predator's mind is incapable of experiencing suffering or pain if it's separated from their body. Suskind brilliantly showed how Grenouille is totally focused on his pleasure and totally indifferent in his interaction with the dead body. The way Grenouille thought of the different scents and listed them was completely systematic and his actions were accordingly automaton like.This novel got a lot of attention because of the shocking and strange nature of the story, but I predict more success and appreciation in the future due to the accurate psychological analysis of a murderer's mind, along with the artistic way in which the story is told.Patrick Suskind created a brilliant masterpiece that will leave readers breathless, shocked, and possibly angry. I hope the reader will understand that this is the point; just because a villain's inner world is described doesn't mean it's a bad novel. Evil is one concept in life, and the job of great authors like Suskind is to present us with the naked truth. Perfume is simply a great work.

I have never heard "No Ordinary Love" played with such overwhelming charm. All tracks are wonderful, but "LA BELLE DAME SANS REGRETS" is my favorite, Sting's voice along with Chris Botti's playing was enchanting.An artist like Botti doesn't need pictures of a beautiful woman with a fake mesmerized look on the cover of his album, but with an outstanding performance like that, some shallowness should be forgiven.

Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard's labyrinth, even though it is liberally sprinkled with a plethora of sometimes agonizing and complex detail, you should not shy away from reading it, for one simple reason: reading Kierkegaard's words is a pleasure in itself even if the topic is already revealed.Kierkegaard is discussing the biblical story of Abraham; the story of an 80 year old man, who prays for a son, and finally has his wish granted by god, assuming it is a true story. Abraham's son Isaac is thirty years old, when God commands Abraham to kill his son; I assume readers know the rest of the story. Kierkegaard is concerned about the feelings and emotions that Abraham as a human had at this point. Kierkegaard suggests 4 different scenarios and discusses Abraham's feelings, thoughts and faith accordingly.The act of killing alone is unethical, but given that God ordered it, a person with extraordinary faith should do it regardless of the immorality of the act. Abraham's faith forced him to make a decision to commit an unethical act, but Kierkegaard's discussion of the story assumes a paradox between what Abraham believed and what he had faith in. Abraham believed that he must kill his son, but he had to have faith that his son would not die; a paradox that only faith will resolve because of the limitations of the human mind. Perhaps the real message in the story of Abraham and Isaac is that having absolute faith in anything is a bad idea. Was Abraham's faith stronger after the incident or did we enter a phase, which continues to this day, where we have faith, but we also question, some more than others?This is a very important point, necessary to understand why Kierkegaard is one of the few thinkers who didn't choose atheism or a simple leap of faith; he chose to oppose religion on a society level and accept faith on a private level between each person and God.Ethical systems are created to protect society in general, Faith necessitates understanding the uncertainties that humans experience when facing a situation of conflict between ethics and religions/beliefs.The way Kierkegaard takes us wandering through his romantic intellectual maze is enchanting and exhausting at the same time, but don't take my word for it, read and explore for your self.

Great acting, great scenery and chilling story; Dracula, the master is backThe movie was released in 1922, but in 1994 it was named one of the top five German films of all time.That just goes to show you that great work goes stronger with time. The greatness of silent movies originates from the difficulty of telling the story and in this silent great work, terror is a mission greatly accomplished.Just a side note; the music wasn't good, but knowing that it isn't the original music of the movie, that just doesn't count.

I included some of the movie's dialog to get the prospective viewer interested in certain aspects of the movie. So if that is a spoiler for you, please stop here!Said and Khaled are young Palestinian friends who are recruited to go on a suicide bombing mission against the Israelis. During their scary journey of decision they express their emotional struggle when contemplating the possibility of killing innocent whilst remembering their oppressed past and hopeless future.The brain washing used to recruit young men that plays on their pain and beliefs, like bacteria on an open wound, are shown through many discussions like what the recruiter said:" What can you do when there is no justice or freedom? Then there's the individual that is forced to fight for it. If we give in to the law that says, the strong devour the weak, then we become the animals. That's intolerable. Death is better than inferiority. That means whoever fights for freedom, can also die for it."The two friends strike a friendship with one of the guys love interest who is an open minded and educated woman. Dialog is the main tool in the movie to describe how difficult it is to get humans to let go of their hatred. The erudite young lady argues with them: "That's no sacrifice. That's revenge. If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier."The dialog again shows how young men face the decision of killing themselves and others as Said puts it: "Even worse, they've convinced the world and themselves that they are the victims. How can that be? How can the occupier be the victim? If they take on the role of oppressor and victim then I have no other choice but to also be a victim and a murderer as well. I don't know how you'll decide, but I will not return to the refugee camp."Eventually, the conversations become simply cold lectures, but some credit should be given to the honesty and truthfulness while exploring the problem of suicide attacks. This is an attempt to convince the extreme Palestinians to snap out of physical fighting and ponder the thought of dialogue and civilized thinking.Watch and think for yourself, you might learn something!

Either/or is two parts in which Kierkegaard used different false names or pseudonyms. The first part discusses the aesthetic or personal experience, where imagination is the most powerful factor of aesthetic pleasure. For the aesthetic, imagination is the only way to break the boredom barrier just as Don Juan avoided repetition of the love act with the same woman in order to break the dullness of repetition. In that way, the aesthetic hunger for pleasure leads to the same void of repetition by seeking a way out of it.Not to spoil the book for readers, but the last section of the first part of either/or "the diary of the seducer" is a very interesting diary in which the character tries to avoid the climax of a relationship with a woman he desires because of the fear of emptiness in relationships. Imagination to the seducer is the only way to maximize his aesthetic pleasure, while the success of the seduction will definitely end the adventure and the prey should be replaced by a more difficult one.The second part, which deals with the ethical, or supposedly a higher form of existence, takes the form of letters written by different characters as a response to the first part where reason not seduction is used to defend values, relationships, and the pleasure of having a monogamous soul mate. The argument in this section promises greater fulfillment from devotion to higher morals which ultimately lead to a deeper aesthetic pleasure.It's widely thought that the discussion of the aesthetic and the ethical is a reflection of Kierkegaard's own confusion, especially after ending his engagement with the love of his life Regine Olsen, just as the seducer of either/or did. I, personally, think that Kierkegaard's either/or is a mature analysis of human nature and acknowledgment of both ethical and aesthetic sides of each individual.Kierkegaard shows the inconsistencies of both positions, the void in human reasoning in both cases and eventually he acknowledges that faith in God is the only way to avoid unhappiness. While Kierkegaard acknowledges religion on a personal level, he still condemns it on a society or church level.Either/or might be a projection of Kierkegaard's own spiritual and philosophical beliefs, or a result of his own experience with loved ones, or an act of frustration against society and church. In any case, I think either/or, though a difficult read, is a very engaging interesting work that deserves your time and attention.

This book includes short and valuable message for young girls. The easy, flowing style and the short pointed messages attract the attention of our girls, who don't have the patience to read through long articles and complicated messages. I was harsh judging Ms. Ford's new book because I was comparing it to the book that she co-wrote with her mom: "between mother and daughter". However; given Amanda's young age, the content of her messages, and the likable style absolutely redeemed this work in my eyes.

Have you ever lost everything you worked for and your life became focused only on restoring your legacy? Have you been extremely depressed that even opening your mail became an extraordinarily difficult task? Has fate treated you so horribly that you keep going in circles without a chance to catch your breath? Has your life revolved around one thing, and one thing only, that without it, you started to lose your existential footing? If you never experienced despair before, or your intellect is a shallow lake, you might miss the point of this movie and judge it harshly like many reviewers. On the other hand, you might be lucky enough to understand the real meaning of life and empathize with each and every character in this movie. I thought no movie could replicate the greatness and depth of the book, but with phenomenal performances by all and equally fantastic direction, this movie captures the essence of the book and lead you down a deep well of insight and intense feeling. Enjoy!

I'm not a big fan of musicals, especially when there is no real plot and actors are shaking it aimlessly. "Chicago" is an exception to that pointless wave of musicals and the story is a great one on stage or on the screen.What makes the movie very special is that it highlights all the characters and doesn't take the light away from the leads: Roxan, Velma, and the attorney.Certainly, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere shine together but great direction by Rob Marshall enhances a perfect plot and makes every character a star including the deceived husband, prison mates and even Velma who's annoyingly played by the equally annoying Zeta-Jones.

This movie tells the story of a family living in East Germany at a time of great political and social change. It explores many facets of love, lies and politics: the bond between a mother and her son, the love of kids for their mother compared to her love for them, the mistakes and lies of parents as compared to lies of children, politics and the economy ruling people's life, and love that actually rules every thing.My words will not adequately describe this movie; you won't regret watching it! The son and the mother are both great actors who make you cry and laugh at the same time.The wounds of a family and a nation are told through the marvelous acting of the mother and son. Watch the silly details as the son's little lie takes on a life of its own, and the irony of meeting his childhood hero, who is drawn into the son's web of lies. Watch the son creating his own East Germany; very funny and very powerful.Such a wonderful movie, a lovely and new story played by great actors and delivered by good director.

This is the quintessential depiction of humanity, friendship, and heroism. I hoped while watching the movie that it was not another "Broke Back Mountain", and I was pleasantly surprised to discover it is not. The smart and penetrating exploration of a professional killer's soul and his journey back to humanity reveals not only moral values, but also the complexity of Israeli/Palestinian conflict.It is amazing how Arabic/Israeli filmmakers are moving toward political and human maturity. After watching this movie, I have concluded that the radicals on both sides will not stop the peace making with that much awareness. Great movie.....

This book is the synthesis of all Descartes physics and philosophy theories divided into four parts. The first part focuses on philosophy, the second part general science, while the third and forth parts are a collection of Descartes' specific principles of physics he used to develop his theory of the structure of the universe, the solar system, and the origins of the earth.Descartes' valuable researches in science and physics have long been appreciated and this book is certainly proof of that value. This book is especially significant because it was written after the Church had condemned Galileo and his theories of cosmology and tried to slowdown or halt the progress of science. Descartes presents very strongly his revolutionary scientific conclusions, but my attention had to be focused on Descartes the philosopher not the scientist.As a scientist, Descartes elucidated basic laws in physics and science, and he brought that logical, straightforward, scientific approach to philosophy and the question of God's existence.In Descartes earlier work "Meditations on First Philosophy", he called all of our knowledge into doubt as he stated: "If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things". Similarly, in The first section of "Principles of Philosophy", Descartes restates some of his earlier conclusions, not to argue what we certainly don't know, but rather to try and determine what we know for certainDescartes' famous declaration "Cogito Ergo Sum" which is translated as "I think, therefore I am.", is the first certain truth that Descartes proclaims in Part I of the Principles. This conclusion, "Cogito Ergo Sum", is for Descartes a truth that cannot be called into doubt: the fact that we exist. Using only this fact, a few principles of logic, and some innate ideas, Descartes believes he can prove the existence of GodDescartes presents two intriguing arguments for God's existence that can by summarized as follows:1. An ontological argument for God's existence that goes this way: Our idea of God is a perfect being, to exist is definitely more perfect than not to exist, and therefore, God must exist.2. We are all born with the innate idea of God as an infinite being, so this idea must have infinite objective reality. Knowing that there must be as much reality in a cause as in an effect, then there must be as much formal reality in a cause of an idea as there is objective reality in an idea. Based on this kind of reasoning, we have an idea with infinite objective reality, which is the idea of God, then there must be a being with infinite formal reality that caused this idea. That being is God. .With all due respect to Descartes, I can't help but asking here if Descartes or anyone else can prove that belief in God as an infinite being is innate? It seems to me that it is more a learned ideaTo spend time exploring the breadth and depth of Descartes' scientific principles and the unyielding logic and order of his philosophy is so fulfilling and enlightening that until we have taken the journey we are, as thinking, questioning human beings, incomplete

After listening to "I Keep Forgetting we're Not in Love any more" on the radio I was overwhelmed by the elixir of nostalgia. I ordered the Michael McDonald's Ultimate Collection CD immediately, and I was filled with unexpected pleasure when this album arrived so quickly from AmazonI kept playing one song after another, enjoying each step of the journey with a true artist. The Ultimate Collection of Michael McDonald is a great addition to every music collection.

This is a typical story of a man planning, what he believes is the perfect murder of his wife. It is incredible that in 1954, movie makers created such a thought provoking plot that would be copied by others many decades later.Admittedly, the old style of acting is sometimes funny and quirky, with the fake kisses and talking to a person while your back is turned to them, but you simply can't ignore the clever techniques of shadows, lights, and various motifs at this early stage of cinema.This is another master piece by Hitchcock that is worth watching and having.

This movie summarizes my dream of a workplace; workers are like a family who protect each other's back. All workers are loyal to each other, and work is more like a family affair rather than the current reality where it is solely a source of income and unhappiness. Zellweger, as always, is awesome in the character of a spoiled city girl who's sent by her company to lay off workers in a small town, but have her life changes immeasurably when she encounters the real people, not merely the workers. Fun and lots more to explore in this movie!

Johnny Depp shines, as always, in a very real and sad story, like life itself! Depp plays Gilbert Grape; a young man who takes care of his sisters, overweight mother and his mentally impaired brother played magnificently by DiCaprio.This is the story of each one of us whose main concern is taking care of his/her family through all the ups and downs of life (even though the downs are unbelievably numerous). If I had seen this movie long ago, I would not have dismissed Dicaprio as a pretty boy; he is such an outstanding actor that enhances the greatness of Depp's presence.Watch, enjoy, and try not to cry especially when Gilbert's mom tells him" you are my shimmering armor"!

From the opening interview with Christoph, the creator of The Truman Show, where he very quickly and rather arrogantly states: "Yes, It is staged but it is not fake" I was hooked. Gott in himmel (god in heaven)!, what could that possibly mean? I suppose Cristoph the creator and producer is telling us that, even though every aspect of Truman's life is staged, his reaction to the scripted events are real. While he may have a point it occurred to me that perhaps Cristoph could predict within a fairly specific range of possible reactions, how Truman might react to a particular stimulus. So are we all being played?What do we learn from the masses who are watching Truman's life as it unfolds? Do they see in the scripting of his life, how scripted and mundane their own lives have become? Do they yearn to break free from the yoke of routine, of sameness or do they, in fact, find some comfort and safety in routine? How will they react as Truman discovers the truth about his life? Sit down, enjoy the ride and prepare your brain and your preconceived notions about what is life and living to be twisted painfully in the wind!

My child and I read a story from this book every night before going to sleep; some were sad, some were sweet, and some were funny.I remember nights when we cried over some of the stories, and others when we laughed loudly.Our favorite story is titled:" a mother knows", which describes how a mom can always feel when something is wrong with her child, even from a distance. The lovely part is at the end when the daughter feels that the mother needs her and she will be there saying:" a daughter always knows".Very sweet and touching book, my daughter will read it one day to her kids.....

Viggo Mortensen plays the role of a Professor and novelist who finds the Nazis completely abhorrent. The professor's novel tells the story of a loving husband, who assists his ill wife in her much desired suicide, gets the attention of important people in the SS. While the SS's interest in the novel has the evil intentions of justifying death, the professor doesn't mind the attention and compromising his morals to become an important officially supported man.The good professor, who is a loving son, caring husband and devoted father, compromises his morals by having an affair with one of his students and giving into the demands of the SS. Watch this frightening transformation of a human and see if one compromise leads to others or if redemption can occur and save the humanity of a good person. I don't want to ruin the movie for people who didn't watch it yet, and even though I don't like the acting that much, I am fascinated by the story. This movie is not a total waste of time!

Norma Khouri wrote a book by the name "Forbidden Love" as the true story of her Jordanian friend: Dalia who supposedly was killed by her family for falling in love with a Christian."Forbidden love" that deals with honor killing in the Middle East, made huge noise when released especially after 9/11, when every Arabic person is seemingly under suspicion as a potential terrorist."Forbidden lies" is a documentary that reveals the falseness of this story by Norma Khouri, who lived most of her life in the United States and is involved in many fraud cases in the United States and England. The documentary also interviews women in Jordan who live in total freedom and great lives of coexistence and marriages with Christian neighbors. As a result of this documentary, the fabricated book that was written as a memoir was pulled off the shelves in Australia and England.It's very important that this documentary was made or else, the vultures will keep spreading lies and using the constant state of chaos around the world to make money.

My discovery of Giovanni's music, 14 years ago, was for me a fantastic and memorable occasion. Finally I was able to get my hands on this nearly impossible to obtain timeless' DVD. It's sad that a great artist like Giovanni didn't achieve the popularity he deserves.In previous albums like "what if" and "Secrets", the focus understandably was on Giovanni's outstanding piano solos. Timeless and other music in this DVD incorporated other instruments that greatly complemented Giovanni's piano performance.Great experience, but a word of caution: This music requires great sensitivity and outstanding taste. If you had a drink or two before watching, you should wait until your mind has achieved a more sublimated state before enjoying the experience.

Poor, pitiful Justine (Jennifer Aniston) works her days away in a dreary predictable discount store and returns home at day's end to her painter husband and his slimy sidekick, who together spend their nights ensconced on the couch smoking dope and watching mindless television. We see in her listless, slumped shoulder walk the look of desperation and resignation. How can we feel anything but empathy and pity for Justine, for the life to which she has been condemned? Is the director making us a witness to yet another yarn about the stifling dullness and persistent hopelessness of the small town cocoon?One day out of the fog of dreariness and predictability a new male employee at Justine's place of employment catches her eye. The young man, who is roughly 9 years her junior, is, as we discover, a candidate in good standing for bipolar poster child of the year. The young man has shed his "Slave Name" Tom and adopted the name of Holden, because he sees himself as the embodiment of the main character in Catcher in the Rye. Justine is attracted to his impetuous and flamboyant personality, because she sees in him an escape from her horrid dull life. As the relationship develops and moves from the mental and spiritual to the physical, Justine withdrawals more and more from her friends and responsibilities. She and her beau nouveau are lost in each other and the possibility of a better life somewhere else. All is going swimmingly until Justine and her Holden are discovered by Justine's husband's sidekick as they emerge from the hotel room after one of their romps in their field of dreams. Things get very complicated after that.As a result of being found out Justine is forced to make other compromises to hide the extent of her relationship with Holden. This is very taxing for Justine and at one time she even considers religion as an answer to her dilemma. Holden also becomes very upset when he discovers some of what Justine has done to cover up their dalliances. To the very end Justine makes decisions and lies to protect herself, while Holden tragically disappears from the picture.What is the lesson, message or insight that we the viewer should take away from this movie. At first glance it seems a simple tale about the consequences of the choices we make in life. Each step we take will to a great extent determine what the next step after that will be. After letting this movie run around in my head for a few days, I have decided that the Good Girl is perhaps the psychological dialectic to the Garden of Eden story. In Eden, Adam and Eve had everything they needed to make them happy and in The Good Girl, Justine and Holden believed that because of where they lived and how they lived that they had nothing of what they needed to make them happy, to fulfill there dreams. Out of these two different worlds, one full of hope and one, from full of despair we see the rise of the same human impulse to break away, to change, even though, the provocations that engendered the need to change things were different, both Adam and Eve and Justine and Holden had to change because the sameness of their lives was too stifling. Perhaps the lesson is that it is ok to break away, to explore more deeply that which makes us human, but do so with your eyes open. Who knows? maybe God wanted Adam and Eve to leave Eden. Perhaps the lesson is that what we don't have always looks more appealing and feels more desirable than what we do have, and the key is not getting what we want but wanting what we have. In both cases, I think we do have a choice, and for that, we are always responsible.

Great music does not age, and like fine wine can only get better with time; Mantovani's music is a great example.This album is a collection of fabulous music, and contains the best version of "Summer Time in Venice" I have ever heard.I'm a very rich woman to have this CD and this kind of music in my collection, but in a world seemingly devoid of taste, I don't think many will agree with me.

"When men are most sure and arrogant they are commonly most mistaken, giving views to passion without that proper deliberation which alone can secure them from the grossest absurdities"-David HumeAs an empiricist, who believes only in knowledge based on experience, Hume explores whether it is possible to arrive at any rational, definitive conclusions about God's nature. By using dialogues against beliefs in God that are based on arguments by design; Hume concludes that religious belief can in no way be based on reason.In "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion"; three main characters are used to explore God's nature; each character represents a philosophical position:1. Cleanthes, representing empirical theism; argues that we can prove God's nature/existence from clues in nature. Through the use of argument from design that works by way of analogy; we examine the complex/ordered/intelligent universe we live in and conclude that it has a complex/intelligent creator2. Demea, representing Fideism through religious orthodoxy; simply rejects the possibility of even comprehending God's nature through human reason.Demea sees philosophical skepticism as the first crucial step toward Christianity, by undermining one's trust in reason and opening one up to pure faith.3. Philo, representing philosophical skepticism; agrees with Demea that God is incomprehensible. Philo rejects the argument from design that appears to resemble argument by analogy; both arguments are at fault since there is nothing to be compared to the universe in such arguments, thus they are both at fault.Just because the world is ordered, it is not necessarily a result of intelligence. Also nature itself doesn't give any evidence that God is infinite, perfect or even present. Therefore, even if the argument from design is accepted, it does not provide any definite information about God's nature.When the theory of evil is presented by Philo, who questions God's moral attributes, given all the evil in the world and settles for the idea that God is morally neutral, the dialogues get very interesting. It even gets more intriguing when Philo, as do many philosophers, attacks organized religions as morally and psychologically harmful, and argues that the only true religion that should be accepted is a philosophical belief in some higher power.Hume reaches the conclusion that there can be no rational basis for any religious belief. Neither reason nor experience can justify a belief in God's nature. Knowing that Hume is strictly an atheist, I felt he wanted to attack all three points of view. Still, it is very hard to decide Hume's true opinion through the dialogues.Whether the reader will agree with some or none of the philosophical ideas in this work, I think that the true genius remains in the uncertainty that Hume leads the reader into by questioning each and every idea.

I loved Mario's voice the first time I heard it in 2002; it was such a great pleasure to finally get to watch him perform.It is refreshing to see a young talent like Mario focused on music and performance rather than the commercial music industry, where looks and making money quickly are the focus.Twenty years from now, when his youth is gone, and his good looks have faded, I predict that Mario Frangoulis will still be going strong and his voice will be another remarkable legend.It is fantastic that concert recording such as this actually has English subtitles to explain the words of wonderful songs that I deeply loved, but did not completely understand.How come no one thought of doing this before (few exceptions apply, some opera Theaters do display subtitles during live performances)? It would be great if other live concerts had English subtitles.Great voice, great songs, great performance....being young and good looking is just the cherry on the cake

As funny as this movie has remained, over the years, it still can't capture the greatness of Reese Witherspoon's performance until you watch her in other movies. Watch her in "Just like Heaven" or "Rendition", Witherspoon still has so much to give.P.S. don't try the "bend-and-snap" move if you are over 35 years old; nobody is watching... even if you are a blonde!

I was a little girl when that wonderful lady died, but I still remember growing up listening to her deep warm voice.I'm happy that I was able to finally purchase this rare CD on Amazon. The CD is loaded with great pieces that Dalida sang in French over the 1970-1997 period, including "fini, la comedie" that has been performed by many people since then. This album is truly, a master piece.

ABBA's music is wonderful, no doubt about it but there is still something so annoying about old people shaking it. Isn't it sad enough that we are aging? Did we have to go through the pain of watching old people acting stupidly? It was excruciatingly painful to watch it.Yes, the movie became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom of all time, but that's how ironic life is. I wouldn't watch it again.

I read the Godfather book by Mario Puzo when I was 13 years old. I think the mastery of telling this story is what started my love to reading. Till now, I still vividly remember most of the details. My passion with this story didn't relate to how good or how bad the characters were, but to how related the delivery of a story to liking or disliking the plot. I hesitated before seeing the movie, as I didn't want to ruin that image I had of the book all these years. The movie, the direction, the music, and the cast were to my surprise a great complement to a great book.Warning: By describing some details of a well known movie, I hope I'm not spoiling the ending for some People, but as it's a well known story, you can choose to stop reading now:From the opening scene with Don(Vito) Corleone (Marlon Brando) dispensing favors to supplicants on the day of his daughter's wedding (The Godfather we are told cannot refuse a favor on his daughter's wedding day) to the closing scene with, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) being greeted as the new Don Corleone, the Godfather is a film of remarkable insight, passion, intensity and breadth set against the backdrop of normal family life. The traditional Italian wedding celebration in all its joy and happiness goes on outside while Don Corleone (The Godfather) carries on the business of organized crime inside the family house.As Don Corleone receives and talks with those who have come to him seeking favors, we learn something about his character, about his sense of justice and his all important connection to his family. The undertaker, who is petitioning The Godfather to do something to the two men who attacked his daughter and were basically let go by the police. The Don asks him "Why did you go to the police first?" The petitioner gives some feeble reply then adds that a friend told him after he went to the police: "If you want justice go to Don Corleone." We see a look of pride in the Godfather's face at the recognition that he is the one who looks after his people. We are presented with the fact that there is indeed a difference between the law(police) and justice (The Godfather) and clearly justice is more important and reliable than the law. Amidst this talk of violence and retribution, we also hear the Godfather ask one of those in the room: "Do you spend time with your family? Because a man can only be a man if he spends time with his family"As the wedding celebration winds on Don Corleone keeps asking where his son Michael is even though his other for children (Connie, Sonny, Fredo and Tom Hagan the adopted street urchin who is now the family Consigliere) are all present at the wedding. Perhaps some foreshadowing of the special connection that exists between Vito and his son Michael. Michael finally arrives at the wedding with his obviously non-Sicilian girlfriend, but yet he remains sort of detached from the whole celebration as he sits with his girlfriend talking about his family and yet at the same time distancing himself from criminal aspects of the family. Likewise we begin to understand the nature of the other siblings Sonny, the impetuous passionate son, whose brain seems to reside somewhere below his waist and rises and falls accordingly, Fredo the fun loving, insecure brother, Connie the congenial, passionate sister and Tom Hagan the measured advisor of whom it is said "He is a good lawyer, but he is not Sicilian"As the film unfolds we are treated to display of some of the Godfather's techniques of persuasion when he is refused a favor by a Hollywood producer. Tom Hagan, who as Consigliere is sent to reason with the producer says by way of warning: "The Godfather never asks for a second favor when the first favor is refused."Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, a minor crime figure comes to see the Godfather to seek his financial support and protection to allow him to expand his small but growing illegal drug business. Don Corleone sees no harm in gambling, prostitution or money laundering, but he finds the idea of the drug trade reprehensible, in spite of the potential profits to be made, so he refuse the request of Sollozzo. This refusal triggers a small war between the Tattaglia and Corleone families. An attempt is made on Vito Corleone's life as he is shopping for fruit at the local fruit vendor (how normal)As Don Corleone lies gravely wounded in the hospital, Michael goes to visit his father. As Michael enters the hospital he notices that the men sent to guard his father are gone. He senses that something is up and acts very quickly to move his father to another room to protect him from the assassins, who are on their way to finish the job. This is the beginning of Michael's transition from reluctant participant in the family business to eventual successor. His ability to quickly recognize the danger to his father and act in a decisive way to protect him shows that he has the perception and the ability to lead.During his ordeal at the hospital Michael is assaulted by a police captain, who is in the pay of Sollozzo and who had removed the men guarding his father. As Michael, Tom and Sonny talk about the assault later, you sense their desire to revenge the insult, but taking revenge against a police officer it is said will release such a torrent of problems that it should be avoided. Michael very calmly and matter-of-factly says he will kill both Sollozzo and the Police captain to avenge his father and himself. More and more Michael is drawn into that which neither he nor his father wanted. As promised Michael gets his revenge against Sollozzo, after which he is exiled to Corleone on Sicily under the protection of Don Tomasino, until the heat dies down.While in Sicily Michael meets and marries a lovely, spirited local girl, who is later killed as part of an attempt on Michael's life. Eventually, Michael arrives back in America, his brother Sonny dead, his father old and ready to hand the reigns of power to Michael.Michael is reunited with and marries Kay his original girlfriend and with each passing day becomes more involved with the criminal activities of the family. More and more he is taking charge and emerging as the future leader of the family. From his foray into the casino business in Las Vegas, to his penchant for vengeance, we see that Michael has the right stuff to be the next Don Corleone.With the death of Vito Corleone, Michael's father, the shadow of another generation of the Corleone family lost to the cycle of crime and violence looms ever larger. We hear Michael greeted as Don Corleone and an unnerving shiver travels up our spine.I have illuminated only a portion of this marvelous captivating movie, but to capture the full impact and beauty of this masterpiece you must experience it for yourself.

Even though I'm intrigued by existentialism, I am still struggling to understand what Sartre is trying to tell us in Nausea. The main character, because he finds other humans boring, petty, phony...., he makes a choice to stand away from the rest of humanity. He is a critical observer, the constant cynic. So much easier to stand at a distance and criticize to feel the Nausea that is humanity. The nausea is only one side of the coin, because not all in life is despicable, crass and disgusting, He has chosen to focus on those parts of humanity that are. In doing so he imagines that he has found a sort of freedom and that he has risen above the fray, the ramble of humanity. The reality is that he has focused so much on the bad, the nausea, that he has built a new prison, an incomplete humanity composed of only the bad and none of the good. He comprehends only half of what we are. There is none of the joy, the spontaneity, the passion, only the ache of the nausea.

The music of Mozart, which can at times seem too technical and precise, has never been played with such passion and beauty. Horowitz has once again shown us why he was the master of his instrument.Enjoy and pay special attention to the Mozart Adagio in B minor; marvelous, but do not forget to enjoy the exquisite beauty of the Schubert and Liszt as well.This Album will never get old, this is a must have for every classic music collection.

My fascination with Bill Maher's cynical, questioning nature started 10 years ago and I have followed his career from the beginning. Bill never questions the existence of God, as he admits that he believes in God. Understandably, he does not, however, believe in blind faith as embodied in most organized religions. I have the same problem with every religion that believes it is true toll booth on the road that leads to God.My problem with this movie from the beginning is that it falls in the same trap that conservatives fall into. Typically conservatives/religious individuals have deep faith in their way and consider any other way a lost, delusional path. My fear and expectation was that Maher would show that no religion answers his questions, he disagrees with all of them and he would conclude that his way is the correct way and that everybody else who believes is stupid; which is again the mistake conservatives commit and I didn't want to see Maher doing it.I tried to be open-minded and I decided not to be intimidated by Maher's cutting sarcasm, especially, when it comes to a sensitive topic like religion.As I watched the movie, I grew more and more impressed by Maher's approach for the following reasons:1. AT the beginning of the movie Maher stated very clearly that he does not question the existence of god.2. He admitted that he doesn't know the truth, which was refreshing.3. He did not accuse believers of ignorance; he simply asked reasonable questions that they didn't have answers to. If faith doesn't provide answers it is simply blind faith.4. He showed that faith doesn't eliminate doubt, by simply leaving his guests either speechless or answering a different question than the direct one being asked.Of course, Bill made some mistakes and proved that he doesn't have all the answers either:1. He got the interviewees to contradict themselves by asking more complex and detailed questions but he acted like a dictator when interviewing a Hasidic Jew. Maher did not allow the person to explain why he is a Jew but not a Zionist; which to me is not a dialogue but rather a diatribe.2. Maher's conclusion is that no religion has all the answers, which is a reasonable conclusion, but it GUARANTEES that he views all religions as nonsense for the simple reason, that he doesn't know. In this way, Maher fell in the same trap of being absolutely and definitely sure based on his uncertainty.I still love Bill Maher, am proud of his endless attempts to discover the truth and freely exercise his mind, but very disappointed in his conclusion. Maher fell in the trap of being a conservative and a radical in his own way, which is the same flaw he criticized in others and here I quote a saying by John Stuart Mill: "Conservatives are not necessarily stupid, but most stupid people are conservatives."I would've preferred that Maher left the movie open ended after presenting his case and admitting his uncertainty. It would've been more "Maheric".

This movie is the story of two strangers who become friends and get over their weaknesses, guilt and uncertainties. For once in their lives, the two friends decide to stop making decisions, since all their previous choices were wrong and together they start an unforgettable journey of becoming themselves, not what others wanted them to be.Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti deliver an excellent performance of a smart, funny and sensitive story. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is no surprise that this movie didn't get the attention it deserves; for truly the masses only notice normal things.

It is not unexpected, that in the myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus, describes human predicament as a form of exile and life as a meaningless struggle. Granted, Camus presents his philosophy of absurdity in all his works, but in this special work he's clearly explaining how his unique view of life's absurdity came to life.Camus is simply trying to say that absurdity is the incompatibility between this irrational world and humans' eternal needs to reason and search for a purpose in life. Through a rigorous examination of various philosophers' work, Camus argues that most thinkers faced the absurdity and tried to escape it, i.e. by either accepting the world's irrationality and finding God in the process, or as phenomenology proposes, rejecting rationality unless the human mind can comprehend it.The most intriguing aspect is that Camus is not arguing the righteousness of his absurd thinking; he's just proposing that this way of thinking is inevitable (maybe just like death). He is debating the possibility of living with the absurd instead of trying to overcome it. Also, Camus doesn't debate any atheist thoughts, and doesn't deny God's existence or admit it. Camus simply admits that he doesn't know of a definite way to know if there's a God or purpose to life, and wonders if he can survive knowing the absurd and living with it. However, I disagree with Camus' conclusion that Kafka is an existentialist who chooses a leap of faith over accepting life's absurdity. Kafka produced great works without forcing a conclusion, leaving it to the readers to come to their own resolution.Another interesting point that Camus raises-but I prefer to ignore as my own act of eluding-is talking about Don Juanism as related to being absurd; Camus just dismisses all assumptions that Don Juan is melancholy or seeking true love , he's simply an innocent human (as opposed to Christian concept of sin) who enjoys the moment, the day to day seductions, and the increased number of his conquests. What Camus is proposing might be real but it dismisses the harm of living without a moral code which leads in a way to earlier nihilism.Over all, Camus magnificently analyzes many aspects of life: hope, suicide, death, freedom, and conquest, which might be an absurd reasoning to some people who prefer to blind them selves with hope or "act of eluding" as Camus refers to it, but I'm sure to others, it is very intriguing and refreshing.Camus's act of questioning the absurdity of life at this point while still trying to live life meaningfully is just an outstanding thinking act coming from a very subjective thinker.

This album has a collection of the blues' genius with other great talents; and lovely performances with Norah Jones, James Taylor, Willie Nelson, B.B. King, Van Morrison. My favorites are: "sorry seems to be the hardest word" with Elton John, and" Do I ever cross your mind" with Bonnie Raitt.A great album that can only be enhanced by listening to another wonderful collection: Ray Charles & friends

Estelle, Inez and Garcin expected to face all manner of torture in hell, but never expected hell to be a regular room, where these three extremely different people are bound together for eternity. During the time in which the characters explore the possibility of coexisting together, shocking confessions about the reasons that lead these characters to their death and subsequently to hell are revealed.Inez, who is a homosexual woman, is the only character that is strong enough to practice her choice even after death. Inez finds her self stuck in an after life with a man she despises, and a woman who doesn't reciprocate her desire.Estelle, a delusional superficial woman who interestingly can't blink, requires the presence of a man to validate her femininity or existence. Estelle is stuck between a man that she can't have, while Inez is watching, and a woman that she doesn't like.Garcin, an immoral villain who cheated on his wife and mistreated her, needs his being and mistakes validated. Garcin is stuck between the lying selfish Estell and the honest opinionated Inez who has no interest in him. Garcin is the only character who gets a chance to leave the room but can't make a free choice to do so. He arrives at the famous conclusion:" Hell is other people".This great story was obviously intended for a live audience. In addition to each character watching the other characters, each being watched by God, every body is being watched by the audience. Sartre cleverly used the awkward feeling of being watched all the time to enhance his story. He probably wanted to create an analogy between this room and the fact of living in Paris under German occupation during Second World War.Please don't stop at "no exit". "The Flies", and "Dirty Hands" are great material that simply didn't get the same fame as "No Exit".

My collection would not be complete without these 2 CDs. Creating a two CD collection which consist of three decades of great work is pure musical packaging genius. Listening to the songs one after another is an endless pleasurable experience in which the music of Simply Red forever pulsates through your memory.Granted, there are still some pieces missing but having: "Stars", "It's Only Love" "Heaven", "Love for Sale" and more, makes a simply priceless collection.It is the very best of Mick and the boys or as it is expressed on the cover: "the music speaks for itself, but then Mick Hucknall always knew it would"

I hoped for an exceptional, relaxing weekend; an opportunity to forget about work, war, murder, recession, betrayal, all the other craziness and simply read a peaceful and straight forward book. I picked "Divining the Body" based on the title, which carried simple peaceful message, and I am craving peace and simplicity.Admittedly, the author wrote the book driven by honest feelings based on her own experience as a true "believer" and as woman, and for that I give the author three stars.I struggled to assuage my strong disappointment in the time I wasted reading this book. I tried to appreciate the author's thoughts about sexuality, religious purpose, and the value of human body. The topics are important, the emotions invested are real and they came from a woman who struggled to make peace with her sexuality and appreciate her body, that said, I felt my little twelve years old already came to these conclusions. "Divining the Body" beats a dead horse and spends too much time on topics that are supposed to be common sense.Most everybody gave this book, big five stars, and were thrilled by the spiritual peaceful journey they completed while reading this book. I'm happy for any positive human victory that was mysteriously accomplished by this book, but still amazed by the emptiness and pedestrian nature of it.

When chocolate making harmonizes with our passions, and the chocolate maker is Juliette Binoche, total success and delight are inevitable.While awakening passion in everybody's life in a small village, Binoche faces the classic struggle between being true to one's self and following what is supposedly the righteous way forced on us by others.Each character in the movie is a forceful presence and each plays an important role in this wonderful story. The short appearances by Johnny Depp ignites a fascinating emotional spark between a noble man and the family of a single charismatic woman and her smart daughter.

"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty or democracy?" - GandhiThis is a valuable and informative documentary; the experts interviewed are not individuals brimming with arrogance and ignorance, but mostly decent American citizens who had faith in their government and did what a loyal citizen would do!I remember, when Baghdad was "freed", watching an Iraqi old man on CNN hitting Saddam's picture with his shoe then holding the picture and crying. It's not an easy thing to understand; the anguish of Iraqi people, who were oppressed by the Iraqi regimen then freed, only to discover, that it's not about their freedom. When you watch this documentary you will understand why American soldiers were welcome by the Iraqi people but were confronted later by their anger. You will also understand the emotional suffering of our American soldiers who found out that they as well as the Iraqi people are being played.Watch and learn, as our American boys and girls learned after starting the war that there is a bigger nastier game at play. Listen to Paul Hughes, David Yancey, Ann Gildroy, Seth Moulton, and Paul Pillar among others and find out how experts like General Jay Garner and Ambassador Barbara Bodine were pulled out of Iraq when they started figuring out the truth just to be replaced by inexperienced people.Learn how Bremer's disbanding of Iraq's military entities affected the situation in Iraq; Why Bremer didn't consult the American military commanders in Iraq before making decisions? Why people like Bremer, Cheney and Rumsfeld declined interviews? How great minds like Sergio Vieira de Mello were lost? How Muqtada alsadr along with other parasites found a stage for their craziness in Iraq? Why precious libraries and museums have been destroyed while the oil ministry has been fully protected? Why was it ok for Saddam to oppress his people and use chemical weapons against them and against Iranian civilians? How come our government didn't intervene then? Do the math and figure out why the average hard working American person is struggling to live when tremendous amount of money has been spent on war.So you said we have prevailed? Sure, Mr. President, you are officially a new Pyrrhus!

My fear was that my daughter would not be into this book, because important books such as this are not easy or exciting to read. My daughter picked it up from among many books I got for me and her and kept on reading all the interesting topics (at least for her) and kept it around to read more. It is fascinating to see her not glued to the computer but reading this book on and off and keeping it next to her bed. Now my baby, I mean my daughter actually gives advices to her friends using tips from this book.Other than the simple and likable way of discussing sensitive topics; Dr. Bradley redeems parents' dignity in their kids' eyes and explain parents' points of view to teens without lecturing them. This book is one of a kind that doesn't focus on preaching and lecturing teens, but addresses their developing minds from their perspective and helps restore the connection between teens and parents. Dr. Bradley is a saint, at least in my eyes!

The movie was intended to be slow and simple, even the humor is very simple, which make sense considering when the movie was made.There is a great message in the movie that summarizes our life; how material things that we never needed can bring bad feelings and emotions that we might never experience if we didn't have the desire to own things. No matter how sophisticated you are, or should I say no matter how sophisticated you think you are, you will enjoy this simple movie.

The play is a description of the morals and values of Victorian England, where a good hearted man, Chiltern is torn apart between remorse over a mistake he committed in the past and his love and devotion to his wife.It was quite fascinating to read Chiltern's thoughts of being a victim of feminine adoration as opposed to his masculine love that accepts loved one's imperfections.Apparently, Wilde believes that the acceptance of loved ones' flaws is a key part of love. Oscar Wilde examines love, honesty, friendship, and forgiveness with a humorous, forcibly happy ending.Nice plot that cleverly mixes seriousness with humor and cynicism with hope. Each character is attractively built, even Mrs. Cheveley, who is the quintessential evil lady, is frankly an attractive evil characterA century later, the same moral irony and the same human nature still exist.

Salma is a Palestinian widow, who is threatened with destruction of her lemon, when a new Israeli Defense Minister moves next to her and is threatened by the possibility of assassins hiding in the grove. Salma, played by Hiam Abbas, fights in court until the end to protect her lemon trees. As the story builds, Salma for the first time falls in love with her attorney and develops human understanding with the Israeli wife of the defense minister.Rona Lipaz-Michael, and Hiam Abbas and the rest of Palestinian and Israeli cast deliver a great performance enhanced by great direction. The lemons and the built walls are smart motifs played brilliantly to create deep moving scenes.In other reviews the movie is being attacked by many people, accusing the movie of being biased for Palestinians against Israelis. If you watch the movie with an open mind, something that rarely occurs with this subject then perhaps as I did you will observe the following:1-the movie shows good people on the both sides like the Palestinian old worker in the grove and the Israeli soldier in charge of watching the grove.2-extremist exist on both sides and the road of understanding is not a paved superhighway.3-thinking is encouraged as shown by the Israeli's wife conversation with her friend and with one of the soldiers. Compassion between Israelis and Arabs is encouraged through the peaceful human encounter between Mira and Salma, who are supposed to be enemies not friends.4- A wonderful picture of the Israeli justice system is shown when Palestinians are allowed to go to the Supreme Court against the state of Israel. This is the most desired interaction between the two groups of people instead of killing.Israeli director Iran Riklis created a master piece that is worth watching and recommending to friends. Ignoring or dismissing the others' point of view is analogous to building the wall shown in the movie. It is about time for civil interaction and this movie among others will help that cause.

This movie was criticized in the magazine Salon for taking the easy way out and by the Los Angeles Times for incorrectly conveying an important message. In spite of such criticism, the director Paul Haggis won an award given by the SIGNIS at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, and Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Much as "Crash", the previous movie directed by Haggis, this movie presents a serious, controversial and divisive topic. Certainly it is expected that not everyone in the audience will be pleased by Haggis' strong and straight forward approach.The plot of the movie is based on the actual experience of Richard Davis, an Iraq war veteran, who returns home in 2003 after he and his comrades participated in the April 11, 2003, "Midtown Massacre," in downtown Baghdad. On July 15, 2003, less than two days after returning from Irag deployment, Davis was murdered brutally outside Fort Benning, Ga by fellow soldiers.Lanny Davis, the father of Richard Davis and a former military police officer, launches his own investigation to find out what happened to his missing son, because the army wouldn't investigate the case and treated it as AWOL/desertion.While minor details and the names of the characters have been changed, Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding in the role of the father, who finds out the truth with the help of detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron).While the investigation reveals the details of the murder, it also reveals the emotional and psychological destruction the American soldiers suffered watching innocents being killed by mistakes, women raped, and prisoners tortured. The movie is a close look at the dilemma soldiers face, when they go back to their normal lives after watching war crimes, and the loss of faith and ambivalence Americans feel between their loyalty to their government and the reality they are all faced with during the war.Tommy Lee Jones out did himself showing conflict and confusion between a father's love and loyal citizen. Also, the ending of the movie is a thought provoking and symbolic one inspired by the United States Flag Code.Now that president Bush is out of the White House leaving some unfinished business, I recall what Mahatma Gandi once said: "What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is brought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty or democracy?". Six years after the beginning of the war against Iraq, what justification will we offer the dead innocents? What comfort will we give to the American soldiers who have suffered enormous trauma facing an enemy they don't even know and now question their values?What brush will we use to paint the canvas of our history in Iraq? Will we use the brush of denial, self justification and delusion or the brush of perspective humility and profound sorrow at an action gone badly wrong?I don't expect many people to agree with my review, especially because of the way we as a nation continue to hide our heads in the sand and follow with blind faith our sense of righteousness and superiority about the Iraq War. Great movies like "In the Valley of Elah' are the simple impetus that force people to open their eyes to wonder and question their actions and political maturity.

Based on the 1951 Catholic novel by Graham Greene that is a tale of his own love affair with Catherine Walston, this movie describes love, obsession, jealousy and eventually examines God's existence.Maurice Bendrix is a writer, who falls in love with Sarah, a married woman, during World War II. She ends their love affair mysteriously after an incident, in which Maurice nearly dies. Maurice writes a personal story of hate and jealousy. Through flash back techniques, intense loving and passionate memories, great performances and enchanting music, the audience discovers along with Maurice the reason Sarah ended their affair.Directed by Irish director Neil Jordan, who also wrote the screen play; the trio of Ralph Fiennes, Julian Moore, and Stephen Rea deliver outstanding performances.Since 1999, this movie remains one of my favorites. Maurice's personal thoughts and struggle, the acknowledgment of God through man's weakness and desires was a creative idea of genius. I still remember Maurice's words:" God, you used my hate to win my acknowledgment. Take care of Sarah and Henry but please leave me alone". Great depiction of human's struggle with faith, sin, love and life.A final word of caution: this movie might be beyond some people's limited mental capacity.

This movie is very close to my heart, or maybe to my dark side; contemplating many subjects like boredom, high expectations, and self destruction. Based on the novel by Richard Yates; I don't believe any other two actors could've done a better job than Winslet and DeCaprio.Love is not the magic cure for problems; sometimes it might make problems even worse. When two people are in love and faced with life's crisis, what are they to do? What are we to do, when our minds take a life of their own and our decisions are separated from our passion, and might lead to our moral demise? Watch this movie and question the story of what is life all about, or as Yates once said: "Most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy."

As I become older and wiser, I lost interest in Woody Allen's work, but this movie is a big and pleasant exception!This is the story of Boris Yelinkoff, a cynical physics graduate and chess teacher, that details how he came to his weird conclusion about life, or as he puts it:"My story is, whatever works as long as you don't hurt anybody. Any way you can filch a little joy in this life, cruel and pointless life. That's my story."All the stories that he uses to prove his theory are as eccentric as he, but they are interesting and liberating in a way. Depending on your depth of cynicism you might enjoy Boris' rants about life and humans. Larry David as Yelinkoff is as funny as always, worth the time!

Are the Israelis and Palestinians addicted to a cycle of war and distrust that will never end? I was hopeful that the documentary, Farewell Israel, would help illuminate this emotionally charged topic, sadly I was disappointed.This documentary accurately presents historical incidents that I was specifically interested in such as: the massacre of the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, the Holocaust, and the Hebron Massacre against Jews in 1929. On the other hand, this documentary tells only one side of the story and blames all Israel's problems on Islam as a religion and ignores all other aspects of the conflict. This is a gaping hole in an otherwise valuable historical documentary. Also, for peace to exist between Israel and the other nations in the Middle East, both parties need to open up and acknowledge the other's point of view. So much of the conflict is born from the refusal of people to talk to, or consider that, the other side might have some valid points as wellMy main problem with this documentary is that it ignores:1. The conflict is political not religious; if we are going to blame Islam for the conflict among Arabs and Jews, we might as well blame Judaism for the same conflict which is clearly wrong.2. The animosity between Jews and Arabs was always mutual and not one sided. If we are going to consider Arabic hostility, it's only fair to mention Israeli hostility as well. The following are examples of atrocities directed by Jews against Arabs:* Massacre in Baldat al-Shaikh (31 December 1947): Haganah gang members stormed the village of Baldat al-Shaikh in pursuit of unarmed citizens. The death toll was about 60. This incident is a perfect example of the cycle of violence and retribution. The attack by Haganah was justified as act of revenge against the Arab population, because a number of Jews (39) had been killed the previous day in a fight between Arabs and Jews at an oil refinery in Haifa.* Massacre in Deir Yassin (10 April 1948): A brutal massacre where 130 men, women and children of Palestinians were killed by Irgun-Lehi guerrillas* The slaughter at the Ibrahimi Mosque (25 February 1994), during which Baruch Goldstein a member of the radical Jewish Defense League opened fire on the worshipers in the mosque killing 29 people in the mosque.I could list other horrific events as well, but it does nothing to solve the problem. It only reinforces that which should be obvious to both Arab and Jew; violence begets violence and revenge begets more revenge and both sides are drawn ever more deeply into this black hole of darkness and hopelessness.3. It is not fair to only blame Islam for the conflict and ignore the fact that a considerable percentage of Christians and Jews are part of the Arabic population and consider them selves Arabic. It is time for some education to take place so people can understand that Arabic doesn't necessarily mean Muslim, and Muslim doesn't necessarily mean Arab. The Druze is a good example as well: There are Druze that serve in the Israeli Army as well as the Syrian and Lebanese Armies.4. The documentary painted a picture of Sadat, the most peaceful leader, as an extremist Muslim, whose hidden agenda was the destruction of Israel. Sadat is a leader with a vision who said more than once that even though Arabs are not to blame for the holocaust, but they should accept the existence of Israel and understand that Jerusalem is a holy land in all religions' eyes and it's not up to Muslims to kick Jews out. Sadat paid his life for his vision of peace and was assassinated by Muslim extremists, just as Rabin paid his life for his vision of peace and was assassinated by Jewish extremists. Neither side is free from the insidious, creeping poison of extremism.5. The documentary showed scenes of Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spewing words of hatred against Israel. Iran is not an Arab country, furthermore; there are similar comments made by Jews that show similar hatred or animosity against Arabs. A few examples follow:* "It is the duty of Israeli leaders to explain to public opinion, clearly and courageously, a certain number of facts that are forgotten with time. The first of these is that there is no Zionism, colonialization or Jewish State without the eviction of the Arabs and the expropriation of their lands." -Yoram Bar Porath, Yediot Aahronot, of 14 July 1972.* "One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail." -Rabbi Yaacov Perrin, Feb. 27, 1994 [Source: N.Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1994, p. 1]* "Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves. Politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country. ... Behind the terrorism [by the Arabs] is a movement, which though primitive is not devoid of idealism and self sacrifice."-(David Ben-Gurion, 1938)* "There was no such thing as Palestinians, they never existed." Golda Maier Israeli Prime Minister June 15, 1969* "Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist. Not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushua in the place of Tal al-Shuman. There is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population." Moshe Dayan, address to the Technion, Haifa, reported in Haaretz, April 4, 1969.6. Both parties have a legitimate view of the conflict. The Jews have suffered enough through out history, and consider Israel their Promised Land and Jerusalem their religious epicenter. The Arabs consider Palestine their land, and have a historic sensitivity to what they see as fighting foreign intrusion. Israel rightly or wrongly is viewed in the same way the Greeks, the Romans, the Crusaders, the Ottomans and the British are viewed by the countries surrounding Israel. If we try to understand the immense long term damage to the psyche of the region caused by the endless conquest and counter conquest, then perhaps we can begin to see two things: First, peace will not come easily because history is not easily forgotten. Second, clearly more war and charges and counter charges of the wrongs committed by both sides will only prolong the tragedy and make peace an ever more distant reality.

It's not a very credible story about two strangers who together survive all kind of dangerous incidents during quite bad times of cholera and political chaos. True friendship doesn't exist, nor does true love. However; the great performance of Bionche and pretty boy Martinez is wonderful and makes believing anything possible. To be loved and protected is extremely wonderful, so dream along with this wonderful story of loyalty and truthfulness.

During the so called "war on terror", DiCaprio plays the role of Ferris; a CIA agent who unravels the hidden parties and games of this war.Other than my personal satisfaction of seeing DiCaprio looking like a man, not just a pretty boy, the character of Ferris displays outstanding intelligence and genuine humanity. To listen to Ferris debating real Islam and verses of Quran with his torturers is priceless because it shows how people are rejecting the lies that terrorists attach to Islam.Pretty boys, Crow and DiCaprio, both showed great talents looking like regular men in a wonderful and thought provoking plot. Watch and think! Does terror have a religion??

You can glimpse the plot of the movie from the title, it is exactly what it says, only completely lame with over-the-hill actors getting richer while wasting our money! I wonder why some people think empty acting can be funny. What happened to smart jokes, even silly jokes that will leave you breathless? Having Vince Vaughn in this movie is a total insult to him; another example how having funny people in a stupid movie doesn't make it funnier!

Since I was charged twice for renting this movie, because of a mistake the cashier made and didn't have the knowledge to fix it. I was forced, in a matter of speaking, to watch the movie, with the hope that I could talk later to a manager at the store who "possessed" the skills to void extra charges.I tried to put my frustration aside and be an open minded viewer. The beginning of the movie was such a clich&eacute; for every man's dream coming true (i.e getting lucky and have a friend who would enable him to have one night stands with pretty women, who he never met before). Thrilled by this new life and the anticipation of his next bed partner, he finds that there's only one woman (of the sex list of course) that he's interested in, and he desires to know her well before bedding her.During the ten minutes interaction between the main character and the charming mysterious blonde, I had a drink to allow me to forget the trite predictability of the lame kisses and the fake romanticism.But, no, just minutes before the bodily union between the two souls, a surprise takes place. Mind you, the surprise is no less lame than the fake attraction between these two very different characters. Our previous geek, now is a hero in love, on a mission to save his woman and find the truth. This is the stuff of comic book heroes not a supposedly serious suspense movie.I don't know if I watched the whole movie because I didn't have much to do this Saturday or because I had a drink and didn't care much. The moral of the story is that the movie ends as lamely as it started, but of course true love conquers all.

"Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth". Henry David ThoreauI'm not trying to defend Islam or any other religion. I'm simply exposing the ways in which this documentary insults people's intelligence. Also, I was greatly offended by this documentary's consistent underestimating of people's knowledge and intelligence.This documentary claims the following: "Relying primarily on Islam's own sources, this documentary demonstrates that Islam is a violent, expansionary ideology that seeks the destruction or subjugation of other faiths, cultures, and systems of government."After watching the documentary, I will argue this claim as provided by the interviewees, as "Islam's own resources".I will begin with the most reasonable and justified comments:1. Bat ye'or; the author of "the Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam" 1985, is an Egyptian born British historian specializing in the history of non-Muslims in the Middle East. In her writings, Mrs. Ye'or focused on Islamic Jihad and the rapid transformation of Easterm Christian lands into Islamic territories, and violation of human rights in Islamic cultures.While all Mrs. Ye'or observations are correct about the dictatorship in Arabic cultures and mistreatment of minorities; she forgot that this mistreatment impacts Muslims as well, and this is what totalitarian governments are all about. Simply because the majority population of these countries is Muslim, doesn't mean that the religion itself is bad. It is time to differentiate between the evil of people and their religions.Also, the spread of Islam in Europe after AD 710, during the Umayyads and Abbasids rule, occurred during a period of political and moral corruption after the death of Muhammad (who died in 632). The existence of an Islamic kingdom at the time, did not mean that it was ruled according to the religion itself. No sane person would argue that invasion and killing are not bad, but if we are going to blame political crimes on religions, then we have to think that Hitler (who was Christian) perpetrated the Holocaust because Christianity is a bad religion, or that Israel has invaded Palestine because Judaism is bad. This sort of logic misses the point that it is individuals acting on their interpretations of religious or philosophical beliefs or simply someone of a particular religion acting in a questionable way.2. Dr. Serge Trifkovic; is a Serbian-American writer and the author of "The sword of the Prophet", who holds a PhD in history from the University of Southhampton and is an expert on Balkan politics and a regular columnist for several conservative publications in the United States.Here I present three important facts:* Dr. Tifkovic doesn't have any experience to allow him to speak as an expert in Islam.* Dr. Trifkovic is of Serbian origin, and we can't ignore the ethnic cleansing directed by native Serbians in former Yugoslavia against Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims. Using the same standards that Dr. Tifkovic is using, one might say that Christianity is evil because of the massacres carried in Kosovo against Muslims in 1992, but we have to be more open minded than that and agree that the religion of the killers should not be blamed for their evil.* It's important to note that there was a long standing historical hatred between Christians and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia, which has its origins in Ottoman invasions. I think it is fair to argue that the Ottomans were acting more in their own self political interest than in the interest of Islam.I tried to listen objectively to Dr. Tifkovic, but when he started talking about the instant gratification described in Islam and humorously said" it's not suitable to talk about it in front of a family audience", I concluded that this information is what he got from all the stupid comments given by suicidal bombers, Bin laden, and Zarqawi.Real study of the Qur'an would reveal that all famous promises of virgins in heaven are man made. It's ok if the uninformed masses think that, but if a PhD in history discusses it on TV in the way he did, it is a sign of a sweeping universal stupidity. The only reason for mentioning virgins in the Qur'an was to say that people all will be virgins in heaven, as all earthly pleasures are not going to exist there.3. Another interesting character interviewed, Mr. Robert Spencer, holds a Master's degree in the department of Religious Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 1986. I thought again that I would learn something from an "expert" on Islam, but he focused on the concept of "Taqiyya" which is, according to him, an Islamic method of deception and hiding one's faith while among enemies. As a fluent Arabic speaking person who studied the Qur'an and Hadith (Not all hadith is proven to be correct or reliable, as it's been told and passed by memorization and oral tradition), I tried to understand Mr.Spencer's accent while he spoke the word "Taqiyya" and thought that perhaps it was a different word he was referring to.It took me few minutes to figure out what word he was using; this word is an Arabic slang for a "hat". No kidding; the "expert" used a slang word that wasn't used a few hundred years ago, but that gave me a clue about Mr. Spencer's sources. Mr. Spencer is not relying on Islamic sources as claimed, but some unreliable internet sites. (the reader can check for his/herself).When Mr. Spencer attempted to justify the Crusades while demonizing the Islamic spread in Europe; I lost interest in his double standard logic which allows some to encourage war, while criticizing the extremist Muslims, who do likewise. Finally Mr. Spencer concludes that even Muslims who claim that they are against killing and forced conversion are simply lying. Furthermore; he says that if they claim suicide is not allowed in Islam then they are lying as well because , or so his logic goes, if the suicide bombers are faithful Muslim, then Islam must allow suicide and it must be terrorist based political movement; a very educated conclusion indeed.4. Another person called "Abdullah Al-araby", who I've never heard of or read any thing by him was talking about deception being allowed in Islam according to the saying "war is deception" and claimed it was part of the Hadith. The statement referred to is an Arabic saying not proven to have been spoken by Mohammed. Al-araby proceeded to say:" In Islam, it is allowed to lie in general, you can lie to your enemy, to your family, to your wife...".The gentleman didn't provide any evidence to support his claim, and I'm at a loss to know where in Quran or Hadith he found that explanation.5. My favorite, another "expert" called Walid Shoebat; a former terrorist and the author of "Why I left Jihad". It is possible to admit one's mistake and change his/her ways, but I wonder if that is enough to make the person an expert on Islam. The former terrorist talked about the beheading of "banu Qurayza" by Mohammed relying on some Persian and Indian art as his source and claiming that it is Islamic art. This kind of art came to life a few hundred years after the death of Mohammed and in no way can be considered a clue to the origin of beheading in Islam; especially not in the Quran or verifiable Hadith.Shoebat also talked how he as an employee of an American company used to lie and fake compassion with Americans and scream "Allahu Akbar" on the high way as he left work. Shoebat concluded that this is the general way Muslims act and they are all liars, and then talked about false meanings of Jihad, heaven, and anti-Semitism in Islam. Again, this "expert" relied on his personal experience as a member of a terrorist group focused on hate and destruction called "fatih" in Israel/Palestine.6. The only two people who said anything positive about Islam weren't identified.7. Two short broadcasts from a radical well known Arabic channel were used to prove how Jihad and martyrdom are Islam's way of advertising killing. The two words of "jihad" and martyrdom" have been abused by Muslim suicide bombers and radicals claiming to represent Islam, but clearly representing only their own hateful views. Jihad is the spiritual struggle against desires and sins, while martyrdom is dying to defend one's family, life, or land.I was about to give this documentary a negative vote if possible, but being good hearted as I am, I gave it 2 stars: one star for getting one thing right; the call to prayer that started this work, another star for interviewing Bat Ye'or who studied history and actually had some historic knowledge even though she did not reach a reasonable conclusion. She can share the star with the other "experts" who wore suits, talked with great confidence but lacked credible evidence to substantiate their claims.

Even though the Inferno is not intended to be an analysis of the philosophy of sins, but rather an implementation of Christian doctrines, Dante did not miss the opportunity to enhance his glory at the expense of his sinner rivals. A sinner's punishment was proportional to their sin, but the degree of evil associated with each sin was defined by Dante's own moral system. It was interesting to note that he considered murder less evil than fraud. Another interesting point was that it was necessary for Dante and Virgil to stop at the river of forgetfulness before getting out of Hell.The intention of the journey was in one way or another to find Beatrice, the love that Dante lost early on earth and was hoping to meet in heaven. Most likely, the Divine Comedy wouldn't have seen the light of day if Dante had married Beatrice.Nice poem, Dante's ego gets out of control at some points, but that can be forgiven, given the artistic work he created.

Following three generations of a Jewish family in Hungary; Ralph Fiennes plays the central male role for all three generations.One of the three male roles is based on the life of Hungarian Olympian Attila Petschauer. The other two characters portray the struggle of Jews living in an anti-Semitic society, their guilt of survival, and the development of political maturity following the HolocaustGreat movie that is worth watching over and over, despite all criticism. No wonder it won Genie award for best movie, best overall sound, European Film Awards for best actor, best Cinematographer and best screen writer.

My daughter and I read this book yesterday at bed time. We smiled, we cried, and we laughed calling the author "Debbie Downer".Our jokes aside though, the book is a very touching story of love between moms and their girls over the years. This is the repeated story of love, pain, suffering and devotion that every mother lives while watching her baby girl grow up and become independent.This book demands a special place in your library

Based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge; one of Hitler's secretaries, this movie describes the last days of Hitler's life. It was exceedingly difficult for me to believe, that any actor could portray Hitler as well as Anthony Hopkins did in The Bunker, until I watched Bruno Ganz shines once again in Downfall.The most outstanding aspect of this movie is that it shows how easy it is to brain wash people and turn them into robots that do whatever they are ordered. Great performance and wonderful direction, enjoy and don't miss watching the interview with Ganz, it is worth every minute.

I ordered Alejandro Fernandez's Album after listening to him sings "Hay M&aacute;s" with Mario Frangoulis. In his defense, Alejandro sounded good and showed some potential.It's not that I regret paying for this album; I'll gladly put this mistake behind me and very happily not listen to it again. However, I think the guy deserves another chance; I hope in the future he can discover words and music put together by some divine artists, or else he will end up as a male model soon.I feel generous today; I'm giving the album one star for the cover which features nice poses, of a well muscled Alejandro, an extra star for the nice picture with the expensive shirt and tie.

I'm going to quit watching romantic comedies for a while; they have been totally abused and over done; this movie is no exception. Cute and good looking people are not necessarily funny, and getting some famous stars to act in a stupid plot doesn't make it a good plot as you can see in this movie. A cute girl takes coins out of the love fountain in Rome, while attending her sister's wedding and suddenly many men start falling for her (I still can't figure why her sister looks like she's 12. Is that even legal?) . Anyway, she believes that all of the guys are falling for her because of the coins she picked up, including a guy that she really likes. The moral of the story is that the girl doesn't want to have some body's love against their will, I think she needs to figure out that this is what alcohol is for, but she reaches a different conclusion! You might want to see for yourself, if you have an hour or so to kill!

I fell in love with Sarah Brightman's voice even before she sang in the Phantom of the Opera. Each new album by Sarah had a special place in my heart tied to a particular time in my life.Now, that I'm enhancing my music/movies collection, I thought why not spoil my self and buy all Sarah's DVD? I ordered all Sarah's concert DVDs including her Harem DVD; what a shock my heart endured...!!!! Being a great singer doesn't imply that you are a great dancer or a fabulous speaker. Simply put, no body can have it all, and dear Sarah needs to understand that.In Harem, Sarah admittedly looks great. Apparently she thinks that she's a Goddess and wants every body else to believe that and focus on her looks and not her music, her vanity has tarnished the glow of her voice and music.Belly dancing is an art, best left to professionals, not amateurs. Sarah insisted on showing too much skin and moving her arms annoyingly throughout the DVD, which greatly detracted from the great words and the enchanting music. What happened to just looking good and slightly swinging gracefully while performing? Did Britney Spears and other" shaking it kids" mantra actually invade good music and sane people too? Does Ms. Brightman truly believe that her recently acquired belly is a greater asset than her voice and music making ability? She might, but please not the constant arm movements.I'll happily go back to playing Sarah's music and skip watching her DVDs. Compared to Sarah, the Il Divo boys look modest and well grounded.God bless any singer who is realistic enough to know that he/she is not all that and stick to what they are good at.

Everyone's sex life is their own; it's no one's business what we do in our bedrooms, UNTIL some individuals (as our politicians do) decide to exercise their moral authority as though it was given to them by God.It is disturbing to see how the people who lead our nation display duplicity every day. What good can we expect of people who can't be true to themselves?It is very important to understand that this documentary does not present a compelling position for or against homosexuality. This documentary simply reveals the cheap games some politicians are playing to deceive their family and their people, while hiding the reality of their lives.The saddest part for me was seeing the exwife of James McGreevy , the previous governor of New Jersey, who found out that her husband of many years and the father of her daughter was gay all along. How can we believe, as a nation, that somebody who can engage in such a selfish deception with his own family can work for the best interest of his nation?It is time for people to stop following empty slogans and self appointed saints, it is time to think and this documentary will help!

The discovery of this young exceptional piano talent was an experience that made my day. On this CD Helen Grimaud chose a theme of death and transcendence wonderfully presented through the music of the "two Princes of piano"; Chopin and Rachmaninov.Piano is an instrument where development of technique does not necessarily create a gifted pianist. Helen Grimaud plays the piano with the discipline of a student, the mastery of a professional, the nuance of a feeling soul and the sensuous passion of a woman.Ms. Grimaud's thoughts, as captured in the written explanations, on this music and other composers, demonstrate an exceptional intelligence and serious introspection about the music she plays.

Johnny Depp is a writer who's going through emotional crisis and is confronted by a stranger, who accuses him of stealing his story and demands him to change the ending. Some of the details of the plot are compromised for the sake of surprise and shock, but the outstanding performance of Depp makes up for any compromises. Watch this movie and try to overlook the simple suspense details and think of the more important questions: If you could go back in time, would you act differently? If you have the power, would you change the ending of certain stories in your life? How torturous is the relationship between you and your conscience, and after all, how outstanding is it to have a talk with your conscience every now and then?

While interviewing Muslims who live in France, United States and Denmark; the viewer hears both sides of the story:1- Muslims, who are proud of their faith, live in a democratic society and participate in building the society, while keeping their faith and spirituality. Imams, doctors, singers, journalists, and politicians are standing up to defend Islam and their newly chosen society against fundamentalists who are on a mission to destroy everybody else.2- Extreme individuals, who claim to be real Muslims, moved to democratic countries that respect freedom of faith and speech, and used this granted freedom to try to replace these societies with a dictatorship, which these fundamentalists claim to be the word of Allah.There is no religion that asks people to kill others, and this documentary reveals both sides of the story without bias and allows the viewers to explore the facts. One important fact reveals that Saudi Arabia funds these extremists, who belong to the fundamentalist Wahabi sect. They were sent out of Saudi Arabia to proselytize in other countries and funded with billions of dollars. Saudi Arabia guarantees peace to itself and destruction to others while still pretending to be a friendly country.The simple and reasonable questions asked by the first group of Muslims are:If extremists want an Islamic government, why move to a democratic country and trying to convert it? Why not going to Saudi or Iran?By referring to the Quran and the real teachings of Islam, the first group proves that radical Islamists not Islam are the problem.The only answers that extremists offer are death threats against everybody who disagrees with them. This blind, narrow minded minority gave themselves the right of being God on earth; judging who's a believer and who's not and who should live and who should be killed.This documentary is a great unbiased work that shows both sides of the story and reveal the intentions of fundamentalists in Europe and the United States. The only thing I would add to this honest work is that these fundamentalists are not targeting civilians in Europe and the Untied States only; they are against every open minded person all over the world. The destruction wrought by these groups affects civilians in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Algeria, and Iraq.Countless geniuses all over the world have been assassinated by fundamentalist groups; their anger started against other Muslims and now has spread to the rest of the world.

Based on the novel by Helen Fielding, the movie tells a story of a single woman in her thirties, who constantly worries about her weight, is bugged by being single, has crazy friends, and is struggling to stop drinking and smoking.Even though Bridget is a smart, beautiful woman, she compulsively says what is on her mind and is constantly embarrassed in public; worst of all, she falls for the wrong guys. Renee Zellweger shines in the role of Bridget and adds considerable talent to the cast of the film. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant were great for the roles of Marc Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.A lovely, smart comedy and the sound track is a fabulous collection of music. Furthermore; you will discover that there is a crazy Bridget inside every one of us, she just happened to find her happy ending.....

Block, the painter, and Leni among others, are strangers who understand the complications of Joseph K's case as well as the details of court operations. The story exist in a state of total chaos, characters come and go for no clear reason, out of the blue, women go crazy over Joseph and then changing on him for no reason, People show concern for him and then become completely indifferent to his plight and an accusation , that he doesn't understand, is made. Joseph doesn't know if it's a crazy nightmare or reality.The court that has access to any information or place at any time and holds the divine authority to decide everybody's destiny, still conducts its business in weird, dark and suspicious places. Is the court a symbol of the unaccountable bureaucracy that Kafka witnessed or was it the inner world of alienation that Kafka experienced all of his life? Was the first building that Joseph went to for the first court meeting merely a strange, empty, dark place or was it a maze that symbolizes a corrupt society?When the prison chaplain comments: "...it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary", did he refer to the corrupted legal system or to the crazy world as Kafka saw it?What does Fraulein Burstner symbolize in Joseph's life? What is the significance of her sudden vague appearance at the end? was she the last connection to life in Joseph's eyes?Why didn't Joseph fight the two men at the end? Had he given up and wanted to end his emotional torment or was it his longing to discover the ultimate truth?As is typical of Kafka's works, there are many unanswered questions, but the journey through his works is outstanding and complex. It isn't called Kafkaesque for nothing.unlike critics who would say that this novel was never finished, I believe that Kafka finished this novel and made the characters and events as random and confusing as possible. Reading the Trial, another Kafka masterpiece, is certainly time well spent.

It took me forever to figure out the right formula for an effective ab work out; it is a combination of diet, aerobic exercise, and specific movements that target ab muscles. This DVD will provide you with the second and third elements, while the 7 day meal plan will jump start your diet. I cheated and didn't diet but started to see results in only 4 weeks which motivated me to go on a diet plan. Make this DVD part of your workout routine, and you won't regret it. If you want to really challenge yourself, you can use the bender ball with these exercises.

Johnny Knoxville shines as Steve, a good hearted but underachieving and discouraged young man. Life's disasters and Steve's passiveness lead him to participate in the Special Olympics as mentally challenged Jeffy. Don't get insulted right away, the movie have a sweet message and heartwarming , touching acting. Most of the actors are mentally challenged and good athletes proving that they are great actors with a wonderful sense of humor. You will not regret watching Jeffy discover how talented and smart these special people are, while they teach him to be a better and more confident person. Respect should be the final message you learn from this sweet movie and the wonderful cast.This is one of the best comedies I have seen!

I tried for a long time to avoid this documentary because I didn't need more evidence of Bush's mental infertility. I don't care how he reacted to the 9/11 attack, after all, we all have our own predictable reactions! I do give a damn though about how we were played... again to make money for a few individuals!Now that Bush is finally out of the office; I watched this documentary as an act of personal grieving over our precipitous descent into a nightmare during the past few years. It is, also, my angry, heart felt response to those who either can't see or refuse to see this cruel game of deception and destruction.For the love of whatever you believe in... Ask yourself: why 140 Saudis were allowed to leave the country after 9/11? What is the connection between the Carlyle group and the Bush's family? What is the connection between Saudi oil money and the Bush's? What is that we allowed the Taliban Minister in 2001? Why our media didn't allow us to see our American soldiers die in Afghanistan and Iraq, while the whole world witnessed it?After all...Britney Spears and America trusted Bush; Please God... have mercy on us!

It is difficult to present such an extraordinary book as a movie, especially with limited cinematic techniques available in 1971. However; the great direction and an outstanding cast that included Donald Sutherland did a great job enhancing and presenting one of the most courageous movies of all times.It is amazing how people can see movies like this one in 1971, and yet our world is still locked in the grips of the same political corruption. After all, and as Joe Bonham said: "What is democracy any way????", when we are so conceded to think we can force democracy on other parts of the world, we better keep on asking that question!

The long awaited first feature film by a Lebanese director and actress Nadine Labaki was a great disappointment to me.With so much talent and perfection displayed by Labaki in her other works; I expected an earth shaking topic and performance.Films exploring virginity, homosexuality, the other woman and poverty are very well travelled roads and didn't need an extra repetetion. In her defense; perhaps Labaki wanted to distract the world from the all-too-frequent subject of war and focus on the Lebanese as humans with everyday problems and feelings. I had, correctly or incorrectly, higher expectations for this movie.

I'm not trying to ruin the movie, but the moral of the story is annoyingly repeated; even if you can see the future, you won't be able to do anything to change it. With a good actress like Rachel McAdams it was easy to allow this topic to pass, a drink might even help, but the annoying cheesiness was difficult for me. The other facts you should know about time travelers are: they are romantic, have money to buy a wedding ring even though they can't keep a job, and most importantly; they lose their clothes when they move in time so they have to stay in shape!You can swallow large doses of anti reality drugs but still can't miss the lameness and emptiness of this movie's pointless need to create some romance, what a waste of time!

We all know the life story of Bundy and his killing sprees. The movie tells the infamous, gory details and the insanity he displayed in court. I believe the acting was over the top because it showed that Bundy acted strangely when talking to women, when in reality he acted normal and charming.Perhaps, the most important detail that was left out is that his victims didn't know the truth about him, but during his trial and when it became obvious how evil he was, women were falling head over heels for him. I can't forget the court scene when all women there colored their hair brown and parted it in the middle because they thought Bundy liked it. The fact that some women will fall for bad guys and be fascinated by them is as dark a mystery as the evil Bundy possessed!"The real problem is in the hearts and minds of men.

Marwan Khouri created unforgettable music for many singers before he turned to singing as well. Now that he has become a well known singing artist with his most recent albums, I was curious to hear his very first one.Admittedly, Marwan's Khayal el Omer was not as successful as his three albums that followed, but it still has Marwan's unique musical signature. I hope Amazon will soon carry his recent albums (All My Poems, the nights and I) I guarantee that any person with good musical taste will be hooked, even if they do not understand the language. Marwan is not only a great musician, but also an outstanding poet.

Aside from all suspense/mystery waves of movies with a stupid good looking actress, stupid plot, and a stupid twist at the end (i.e. lame movies like "deception")... This movie is an exception; Jennifer Anniston delivers on her promise of being a star again and again. I don't want to ruin the movie for the appreciative audience, so I will simply say, very much recommended!

Our teenagers face many challenges that we did not necessarily encounter; no question about it. Dr. Pipher explores many cases of patients she dealt with as a therapist to educate the reader and reach the conclusion that our culture targets the souls of young females through media and hidden sexist messages to a point that young women lose their true selves and their identity in a desperate attempt to please others.According to Dr. Pipher, Ophelia from Shakespeare's well known play "Hamlet" is the best example of how females are pressured into pleasing others to such an extreme that they are weighted down and lose themselves to drown like Ophelia. The mistake I see Dr. Pipher repeating that other famous female thinkers like Simon de Beauvoir made (Pipher quoted her few times in this book), is that they only view females as victims while painting culture and males are the offenders.Feminists are demanding equality with males, but they forget that men and women have different responsibilities and as a result there will always be unrealistic responsibilities/ standards against which females are measured. Whilst blaming culture and society for female's problems, we forget that we females are the main accomplices in this crime. Females are part of the sexually oriented commercials that treat women like sex objects. They are the individuals who participate in beauty pageants and forget about their soul and spirit, as well as these who go through tortuous plastic surgeries to please men and meet unrealistic cultural beauty standards. The only way to revive these Ophelia's is facing the truth instead of blaming the others. Only then, we can move to fix the way this world view us.It is true that culture and media pressures contribute to young females' dilemma. Dr. Pipher examined many cases of troubled female teens, but she failed to propose a real solution.Females are not the only victims; both Ophelia as well as Hamlet must be revivedMen and women should collectively liberate themselves from this decaying culture. We simply can't fix the young spirits if we don't start with ourselves including males/females and most especially parents.

A Muslim cab driver, who is taking care of his brother's wife and son while the brother is missing, gives a ride to a mysterious woman. This little incident leads both people to reveal their lives to each other, and discover each other's flaws. While some flaws are forgivable, others are fatal as you will discover when watching the movie.I'm pleasantly surprised that finally an American movie portrays goodness in Muslims. While others are criticizing the movie for showing unbelievable evil in humans, I think that a movie needs to use some extra measures to show the contrast between good and evil, or as Buddha once put it: "There has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it. "

The beginning of the book wasn't very encouraging, as Zimbardo describes in graphic details the "rape of Rwanda" in 1994, when the Tutsis were slaughtered by their former neighbors, the Hutus. Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, a former social worker, who was supposed to be the only hope left for the Tutsi village of Butare, had promised food and shelter sent by the Red Cross to the people of the village. Instead, Pauline arranged for Hutu thugs to rape and kill the Tutsis. Pauline ordered the rape of the women before having most Tutsis killed in a massacre that was one of the most barbaric incidents in history. Zimbardo provided a combination of history and social psychology to explain how Pauline turned into a special kind of a murderer and even provides a comment by Nicole Bergevin; Pauline's lawyer which summarizes the fact that all humans are SUSCEPTIBLE to evil under certain circumstances.I can't help but wondering, how can a person like Pauline who intentionally tricked the Tutsis and planned one of the most savage, torturous and sadistic attacks in history be used as an example of how good people can turn evil under situational pressure? EITHER WORDS HAVE MEANINGS, OR NOT. At this point I had to recheck if Zimbardo was an attorney not a psychologist (to be able to find many unreasonable possibilities for the obvious), but I was wrong, he's for sure not an attorney. I still think, with all due respect though, that Zimbardo can make a great criminal defense attorney.Zimbardo uses other examples of war where morality is disengaged and barbaric behavior is directed against any body considered to be the enemy, because of the power of situational forces over individual behavior. At this point, I wanted to stop reading but Zimbardo promises to reverse the question at the end of his research, which is asking if we are capable of becoming heroes after analyzing why we can become capable of evil.I had nearly fixed in my mind my interpretation of this book; I believe that any body can turn into a killer when it comes to protecting loved ones (i.e. in self defense), but the idea that we can become evil just because others are, is beyond me. Even as kids, some kids will set the limits and refuse to gang up with bullies against the weak easy target. Even in war and crisis, people with basic concepts of morality will have mercy on the enemies when meeting as two humans on the battlefield (if that even exist any more), or when it comes to killing civilians.I believe that good is the rule and evil is the exception, so with the slight hope promised by the author of reversing the question, I was willing to take the risk of spending more time on this book.Doubtful, but willing to explore, I started reading about Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment:An experiment Zimbardo conducted in 1971 on some college students, who were asked to play the roles of guards and prisonersThe detailed behavioral analysis of the teams of volunteers, who very quickly turn into abused and abusers, such that the experiment had to be interrupted within a week, was unnecessarily long, but I was still curious.Personally, the experiment does not sound scientific to me, especially when it doesn't provide any emotional or psychological history of the participants. Also, the idea of a professional, watching and hearing the verbal and semi-sexual abuse that the prisoners experienced is a skate across very thin ethical ice.At one point in the book, Zimbardo used the results of the Stanford prison experiment, when he was called as an expert witness in the trial of Sergeant Frederick, one of the defendants in "Abu Ghraib" trial. Also, later in the book, Zimbardo's analysis was compared to many documented historical incidents of prison cruelty and other cruel acts committed during wars.My conclusion is that I'm happy I took the time to listen to the other point of view.I admire the author for his 30 years of persistence and devotion to the study of a concept in which he has faith. Likewise, I respect his courage in blaming the Bush administration as accomplices for the torture interrogation in Iraq. Also, Zimbardo's brutally honest telling of the Abou Ghraib trial's details supports my belief about the insidious corruption in the legal systemDespite my understanding of the "us versus them" concept, there is no detail in the book of a study that shows examples of a previous good history of these soldiers/people "going bad". ". The Stanford prison experiment itself focused on a number of volunteers with no analysis of their characters. Here I can't help but asking a simple question that also takes us back to Pauline Nyiramasuhuko and the rape of Rwanda: what if these people are actually evil, who just like sadistic individuals simply don't feel the pain of others if it's separated from their own body? Where is the proof that they were good people previous to the new situation???. I don't have any facts to support my theory here, but just like kids who are not joining bullies hurting other kids, I can see other soldiers in Abou Ghraib saying no to the other "bad" soldiers, and others dying on the battle field trying to save some civilian enemy. It's not a result of a physiological research, but a simple romantic hope for goodness in people.Aside from all my objections, Zimbardo, who fulfilled his promise of reversing the question and provided some instructions to resist the power of social/political pressure and to not join the "herd", did a reasonably good job.

Daniel Pearl's story is truthfully told in this movie, but it is told through the eyes of the woman who shares Pearl's legend as a hero, his wife. I'm not a big fan of Angelina Jolie, but I consider her performance in "A Mighty Heart" the best she has delivered.True, the movie was criticized for not having enough details about Daniel's suffering in captivity. It's even documented that Daniel's friend Asra Nomani criticized the movie saying :" Danny himself had been cut from his own story". However, we need to understand that the intent of movie is to show the heart break of a woman who lost the love of her life in a horrible way. The documentary about Pearl is a must see and this movie is not in any way a substitute for that documentary. The movie tells a story, from Marian Pearl's point of view, of heroic love and a lovely soul that were so cruelly and horribly destroyed.Marian Pearl understood that the killers were not about religion, as Daniel's best friend was a Muslim (Asra Nomani). The book, as well as the movie, shows Marian's political/spiritual maturity and understanding of the big and nasty political game.

The review on the cover promises a great story, but instead we are fed lame good looking people, who don't miss a chance to take off their clothes while trying to figure out the PUZZLE! It ends as poorly as it starts, but it's yours to explore. I still have no idea what Sela Ward is doing in this movie; I guess every mountain has a valley!

Renee Zellweger shines as Ann, a wife who finds out about her cheating husband and takes her two sons on a road trip in search of new beginning. The two sons' characters are as smart and deep as well as entertaining and ironic!The family's journey takes us on emotional trips through their souls, dreams and what is really important to them. The story is based on George Hamilton's early life, and the movie surprises you with an amazing cast of great actors.I'm not surprised that these kinds of movies don't make much money; they are just too deep and sensitive to satisfy the seemingly opiate infused minds of average viewers!

My brain gets turned off by the performance of pretty boys, but I took a chance and watched "Syriana", only to be pleasantly surprised that Clooney and Damon are not only lucky pretty boys but great mature actors.The parallel stories of charismatic characters will take you on a breath taking journey, which strips naked our illusions about the world and reveals the harsh reality of how money, religion, and power are driving the whole world into hell.While trying to raise a family, figure out the truth, or simply get ends to meet; our heroes get manipulated and destroyed, revealing the bigger picture of what's happening around us. The greatness of this movie is that it shows free spirits all around the world, regardless of their color, religion or identity who are torn by the same universal power and money game.George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Mazhar Munir, and the fascinating Alexander Siddig deliver an outstanding, courageous, and thrilling master piece; highly recommended.

At a time that followed witch hunts and religious persecution, Voltaire wrote Candid as a scream in the face of church's authority and nobility's arrogance.Candid is a simple Pollyannaish young man who mirrored all the views of his tutor Pangloss, who has the optimistic belief that this world is "the best of all possible worlds", and despite all the misfortune he endures he remains faithful to his optimism. Pangloss obviously is an exaggerated character, who symbolizes the overly optimistic Enlightenment philosophy.When Candid is expelled from his adopted childhood home, he starts a journey around the world pursuing peace and looking for the love of his life, Cunegonde. During the journey, Candid encounters many different characters, who have symbolic importance, like the baron who has homosexual tendencies, Cacambo; Candid's close friend, whose practicality opposes any philosophy, the Grand Inquisitor, whose hypocrisy points clearly to religious leaders, and Martin, the cynical scholar, who is blinded by his pessimism.The long journey was a series of chaotic incidents that bring to the forefront significant controversial topics, like the uselessness of philosophical speculation, hypocrisy of religions, political and religious oppression, and resurrection.In Candid, Voltaire, artistically displays his objections to the school of optimism that argues rational thought restricts evil committed by human beings. Voltaire also criticizes the philosophy of enlightenment that couldn't stop the fear and chaos caused by religious persecution. He ends the novel by presenting us with an unexpected gift, his philosophical meaning of life.Candid is simply a great work, worth the time.

In this DVD Billy Blanks' Tae Bo moves are combined with over all intense body workout and elevated to the next level by using the rubber band. This work out will build you up and prepare you for "Ultimate boot camp" and it is very effective if you alternate it with "Ab boot camp". I had to order the other two DVDs once I tried this one.

My child's teacher suggested I read this book, after dealing with self righteous parents, who injected themselves into my child's life through their kids. Righteous parents are always confident that their kids are perfect and that they themselves are quintessential parent. I'm constantly amazed by parents who think that giving material things will compensate for not spending time with their children, and that staying out of their kids' business is projected as "democratic" parenting. However; this book opened my eyes to the fact that we need to let our kids fight their own battles sometimes. Being overly protective might send the message to our kids that they are not capable or strong enough to handle their problems.The trick is deciding when to step in and when to back off and this book will teach the trick to every parent who is open minded enough to admit that they are not perfect. The book taught me that I can't protect my child from all heart breaking experiences and that allowing her to go through the pain might help her become stronger as she grows up. Our children will encounter different bullies/situations throughout their lives. Sometimes we need to let them make their decisions and other times it is our duty to confront the adult bullies behind the young bullies in their lives.One other valuable new thing I learned from this book is that the game of bullying and authority struggles that we face as kids might extend to the parents' world. Dictator parents never grow up and seek to expand their authority through their kids to other parents. It is true that" the apple doesn't fall far from the tree". Our duty as parents is to not follow the dictator parents in our community who think that they can rule the world and bully teachers and other parents. This book is priceless; while other people harshly attack this book, please see for your self.

Members of an Egyptian police get lost and end up in the wrong town in Israel, instead of the town where they are supposed to perform for a ceremony at the Arab arts center. The members spend the night in that town but didn't have the right currency to go to a hotel. An Israeli woman who owns a tiny restaurant offers that some spend the night at her place and some at a friends' house.Despite the history of animosity between Arabs and Israelis, the members of the band find themselves opening to their new friends and finding a mutual bond as humans without the expected baggage. Nice simple stories with a new kind of comedy are told in this movie; in a way that isn't typical in Israeli or Palestinian movies. Watch and discover each character in this wonderful movie, it is worth it.

This book about three of my favorite thinkers was one of the easiest books I have read, I'm grateful that it also introduced me to the work of a forth great thinker: Kierkegaard.Although I might disagree that the four men are directly related to existentialism (If Nietzsche was alive he would've agreed with me.), but there is no doubt all four writers were alienated from the society they rejected, and each in his own way embarked on a quest to find the truth.I'm at a loss to explain why this book is accused of having a "Christian-centric focus", Mr. Hubben simply presented the biographies objectively, and related them to the work's of other great authors.Let us not forget that the theme of the four men's lives was being rejected (mainly by the church and society) for not believing what was believed and not going blindly with the flow.Mr. Hubben accurately reports the suffering of the four men on totally different levels, he didn't suggest in any way that embracing Christ would've been a better choice:1- Kierkegaard who opposed the church not Christianity.2- Dostoevsky who chose a leap of faith, and talked of Christ almost in all of his work, but still never stopped questioning and doubting.3- Nietzsche who decided to revolt against all rules and chose to be an atheist.4- Kafka, a non believer among Jews, who felt a profound sense of alienation from society as well.How can the enumeration of the facts surrounding the lives of these four men be described as pro-Christian???The religion/faith factor in these four men's lives can't be ignored while studying their lives, but that doesn't mean necessarily the author is presenting a pro-Christian point of view. The four men were not chosen as the subject of this book to challenge any religious values, but simply to celebrate great minds and free spirits that were not afraid of expressing themselves.This book is a good objective overview of four remarkable thinkers, who were never appreciated during their lives.

This movie takes the story of one bad and greedy Jew, and applies it to all Jews. This logic is as disgustingly corrupt as drawing the conclusion that all Muslims are terrorist based on a movie about Bin Laden!However, the negative effects of this movie were unimaginable; it became number one in 1939, and was shown to SS units and to non- Jewish audiences, after which anti-Jewish violence increased dramatically.Judge for yourself, you might see it as a bad movie because of the anti Semitic content, or you might think it's great historical documentation that projects the Nazi's anti Semitism and corruption. This is the Nazi's own admission of biased violence and hatred. Watch this movie, take a deep breath of history and know how putrid it is!

This is the story of every nation ruled by a dictator, where the people dream of a better life and support a revolution but the old dictator is overthrown and replaced by a greater villainous scourge. There are countless examples of citizens' disappointment when they discover that the devil that is now in charge is worse than the devil they had before. After all, Man's greatest achievement is his unlimited capacity for self deception.Maximilian II is an absoulte dictator in a land named "Everycountry", who declares himself "president for life".Joe, played by Ralph Fiennes, is a security guard working at the prison where Thorne (Sutherland), a carismatic intellectual rebel is treated savagly. Joe feels in his heart that Throne is a good man and learns a lot about him while bonding with him. When Maximilian seeks popular support, he releases Throne from jail, to serve as a government member. Joe is promoted to serve as a guard at Maximilian's palace. Because Joe trust Thorne he allows Thorne and his followers into Maximilian's inner chambers, where Thorne kills Maximilian and his wife.Joe watches in terror as Thorne, whom he had idolized, transforms into a villain, who rules "Everycountry" with absolute totalitarianism, Education is prohibited, women are covered with burqas and thinkers are sent to re-education camps. When Joe realizes he has been deceived, he refuses to work for the new government and he is sent to a re-education camp where he is treated far worse than Thorne had been treated in prison.As much as I love Sutherland, he was so convincing that I deeply hated the character. Finnes is magnificent as always, watching him listen to the re-education Camp Director Saying : "A stale piece of bread is better than nothing. And nothing is better than a big juicy steak. Therefore a stale piece of bread is better than a big juicy steak" brings back many images of struggling deceived nations.

The idea of a group of silly and awkward friends was well presented in "40 year old virgin", but how many times must we plow the same worn out idea? It is getting boring and annoying. In this movie a group of annoying guys are friends, and the least attractive among them falls in love with a very pretty inside out girl. Like that happens in real life, usually guys fall for bad girls and vice versa!Fantasy is not a problem, if it wasn't for terribly annoying scenes that are not funny at all. See for yourself or save the time and money and don't!

Countless movies were made about the tragedies of World War II, but I have never seen a more perfect and touching movie. The story is about a Jewish woman who's trying to survive after losing everything she had. It turns out that even when you are dead inside, you can still hurt.Carice van Houten is an incredibly talented actress as described by the director. I enjoyed watching her carry the burden of creating the action around her character whilst allowing the other characters to shine. Sebastian Koch, Thom Hoffman, and Derek de Lint are all amazing telling stories of love, betrayal, loss, parenthood and heroism. It's been a while since I cried, and I did watching Carice finally fall apart in tears. Amazing performance and direction; don't miss it.

A perceptive boy becomes overly fascinated in Nazi crimes, and discovers that his neighbor is a former SS officer. The boy blackmails the old man in an attempt to learn more details about the torture that took place in the concentration camps. The relationship between the two becomes complicated, with compassion, resentment, and darkness. The duo of Ian Mckellen and Brad Renfro are amazing to a scary and fascinating point. Even though the movie has been attacked and underappreciated, probably for its representation of the SS officer character and the dark side of humans. Just as life is not entirely good; humans also have many flaws. This does not mean the movie is bad because it focused on those flaws. You might learn eventually to see that even evil people are not entirely bad. This is an amazingly deep movie that will haunt you.

Ms. Klein's work has been criticized because she does not provide a solution for the crisis, for her efforts she receives comments like: "depressing work", and the funniest accusation: "no understanding of economics!". No good solution can be expected when the decision makers are fixated on profits and hidden agendas. Depression is the only reasonable human emotion when you come to understand the crisis, and for the last claim of "no understanding of economics", I have nothing but a loud raucous laughter. Economics is working fine for the decision makers, but not for the dead and for sure not for the hard working American person!Knowing that this work is a collection of Klein's articles concerning the anti-globalization movement and corporate power, please approach it as an independent work. It's not fair to compare it to previous Klein's work considering the different dates and associated events of these articles.Read the facts; what is so brilliant about Ms. Klein is that she bases all her ideas on facts. Try to understand why" when a few people decide to live larger than life, we all get trampled"!. One of my favorite articles is:" The Brutal Calculus of Suffering; when some lives seem to count more than others". I tried to explain to many of my friends why "others" were celebrating when 9-11 happened, not because I am a traitor but because I keep on watching what's happening on the other side of the world and I know how our media is separating us from the suffering of others. Naomi Klein finally puts it into words and facts for anybody who wants to understand that the lives of others are as valuable as American lives!If you live in your own private Disney Land and you don't want to explore the facts, then don't read this book. If you want to stay where ever you are intellectually, then avoid reasoning, exploring and thinking, but if not, then you will love this book.

Though this movie wasn't Fritz Lang's first, it was the one that catapulted him to fame.And viewing this classic shows why.Set in the same anywhere and anytime that all fairy tales seem to take place, Destiny is the story of a young woman who tragically loses her husband to be.Desparate to bring him back, she tracks down Death himself in search of a bargain: Tell me what I can do so that you can return my fiance to me?Fortunately for her, Destiny's Death is a particular compassionate one.He shows her three candles and tells her if she can keep any of them burning...then her love will be returned to her.Through those stories we follow our lead to Arabia, mideval Italy and China as she tries to keep those candles alight. Each of these vignettes is a compelling story in its own right and utilizes what were then cutting edge special effects.But it's perhaps in the movie's closing scenes, when the story is told largely shorn of special effects that the movie assumes its perhaps most poignant moments.This movie originated in a dream and Fritz Lang's certain directorial hand shows the confidence that would so become the hallmark of his later career (see, e.g., the better known Metropolis and of course M). This version retains the score that Lang intended for distribution and in this way it can be said that this serves as the "director's cut" of Lang's vision.

In this documentary, Ben Stein tries to investigate the intelligent design concept by interviewing followers and opponents. In defense of intelligent design, Stein goes back to the theory of evolution and relates it to fascism, Nazi's practices and atheism. At the same time, Stein and the interviewees claim that intelligent design is driven by science not religion. However; no scientific evidence other than complexity of designs was given to support this claim.It is very refreshing to think freely and investigate, and for that alone Stein should be praised, but he spoiled that refreshment by being judgmental and offensive during his interviews. I have to admit that Stein doesn't have the charisma and presence that Bill Maher, for example, offers to keep the audience engaged when debating such a weighty subject. Also, As Stein made his case about the holocaust, the deep emotional pain that he obviously feels as a Jew, became a distraction and detracted from the strength of his argument.Regardless whether you agree with Stein or not, I think it is worth it to watch the debate and decide for yourself.

Apparently, I like others was skeptical about watching the movie Crash, because I had heard that it was a movie about prejudice and how it impacts the lives of those that are the target of prejudice. Certainly the knowledge that prejudice is bad and has a huge impact on its targets should not be new to any of us that consider ourselves human. My suspicions about how viewers perceived this movie was confirmed by a quick scan I did of a number of reviews for Crash published online. I suspect that as with all things human, especially where emotion is involved, there is more to the story than the obvious lesson that prejudice is bad and we should not allow ourselves to be caught in its grasp.Crash as a movie focuses on a number of events that at first seem unrelated, but are eventually tied together in a neat package. As we watch these events unfold, we see pernicious, insidious prejudice show its ugly face. The white police officers stop the black couple and engage in reprehensible actions, because they feel they are entitled since they are white and policemen. An Iranian immigrant, who is concerned about his security and the security of his family at his store, hires a Hispanic locksmith to fix the lock on his door. The locksmith tells him that he can fix the lock, but that he really needs a new door. The man becomes irritated and tells the locksmith to only fix the door and not the lock, which he does. That night the store owner's store is vandalized in an apparent act of prejudice. When he discovers the vandalism the next day and the fact that the perpetrators broke in through the door he had just fixed. He becomes irate at the man who fixed the lock and sets out to punish him. At this point a miraculous event will turn the events around and reveal some hope, while another shocking event will unexpectedly take place to show how easy and disastrous it is to fall in to the trap of stereotyping and prejudging people. These are few examples of set of events that we see in Crash that get woven together. I could describe others as well, but to do so would be tedious and pointless.Clearly as so many others have written in their reviews this movie is about prejudice and as we all know prejudice is a bad thing; it corrupts our souls and our humanity. Why then make yet another movie about prejudice? To take that position is, I think, to have fallen squarely into the trap laid by the director of Crash. Those who have formed their own prejudices about the movie based on what they think it is telling us, have missed the fundamental point; that prejudice can creep into us even when we think we are not prejudice. Keep alert against the creeping poison of prejudice or you, too, may Crash!

What is brilliant about this documentary is that there are no commentators to direct the thoughts of the audience. It is simply Bush and his herd manipulating us; the American people who trusted them.I'm very happy that this documentary was recommended for me by Amazon while I was searching for a truth that is very obvious. Watch and listen to the claims that justified the war, compared to the results of the big lies that led to the deaths of American soldiers and innocent Iraqi people.It's ok to be a loyal citizen and believe what you want to believe, but it's not ok to blindly follow without questioning. Watch and think, it's not that hard!

Rana's Wedding moves at an excruciatingly slow pace, telling the story of a girl who chose to stay in Palestine and marry the man she loves. I guess the point was to show that love and happiness can be victorious over death and war. True the message is sweet but the movie/acting is too cold and slow telling a story that is over told about Palestinians and Israelis.I think that there are other smart and subjective movies that explore this topic much more richly.

Zellweger plays the role of Ellen; a young successful woman who moves back home, leaving her career and love behind to take care of her dying mother (Streep).Getting close to her dying mother, Ellen undergoes emotional transformation about life, family, role models, and happiness. As powerful and changing the emotional journey of the family, it is peaceful and profound for Ellen and her self discovery!This movie is a spectacular exploration that will show how simple and easy it is to appreciate what we have and love our lives or as Streep puts it: "It's so much easier to be happy. It's so much easier to choose to love the things that you have, instead of always yearning for what you're missing, or what it is that you're imagining you're missing. It is so much more peaceful."

Admittedly, there is no obvious compatibility between the great Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson; even having them both in the same scene is not easily comprehensible. C'est la vie.The message, the story and Hoffman's performance are so great that even Thompson deserves a last chance.OK, enough with the sarcasm! It is a good movie, and even middle aged/out of work people can dream of a last chance. "Last chance Harvey" is a sweet movie that adds to Hoffman's victories and Thompson's history.

My primary fascination with Ludwig Wittgenstein's work is the fact that his study of engineering led to his interest in the mathematics that underlies engineering, and then to an interest in the philosophy that underlies mathematics.Even though, he remained skeptical about philosophy, he produced great works and Blue and Brown Books is no exception. This is a unique work in which Wittgenstein tackled long standing philosophical problems in a revolutionary way. Wittgenstein argument was not with previous philosophers but with philosophy itself.In "blue and brown books", Wittgenstein tackles the richness and diversity of language use by starting with the meaning of a "word", and proceeding to language games, the use of analogy, the Ostensive definition of a word, and the philosophical confusion that arises when grammatical impossibility is mistaken for physical impossibility.Admittedly, Wittgenstein's logic is not the easiest to follow, but his use of language games to show that there is no distinct process that characterizes all cases of meaning, understanding, and believing, is undeniably intriguing.

Last mother's day she got me this book along with a card that has her voice recorded (people who invent this stuff will always get a mother to smile or cry with joy).The book is a collection of statements expressing love and gratitude, some of them are very sweet and others are very funny. In every page, there is a picture of a mother/baby animal that is carefully selected to go with every statement.Books like that are simply precious treasures....

The genius of this movie is that it's animated; there is no way to capture all the feelings and emotions with real actors.This is the story of every society when one dictator falls to be replaced by worse dictators. It is the story of young souls watching their dreams of freedom and justice fall apart. It is the story of being stranger in your home land and everywhere else, and it is the story of how religion is used to manipulate and control people.Watch the story of little Marjane, her little bread swans, her story with God and life and don't fight your tears. The realism of the story, the sadness of Marjane, the portrayal of societies' helplessness and political/religious manipulations make this movie a real treasure. Enjoy!

The plot of movie is well known and the book is a well regarded masterpiece. Given that, I will focus my review on the cast and the outstanding performances.I got this movie believing that my favorite actor, Ralph Fiennes, would perform the parts of both young and older "Michael". The discovery of the young star David Kross shinning through as the young Michael only added to the uniqueness of this movie. While every movie Fiennes stars in exceeds my expectations, I'm grateful that Fiennes appearance wasn't prolonged because it gave space for other stars to shine as well. Simply put, stars are not easily seen in the presence of the sun, and for Fiennes to accept such a small role adds to my certainty that he fell in love with the story and the cast.The movie is not only the story of an unusual love story between a young boy and an older woman, nor a repeated expose about war crimes. Rather, the movie is an unbiased and close observation of the human experience of good, evil, love, rage, loyalty, and unexplained ambivalence.Kate Winslet was born to play Hanna's role, a complex character that is torn between her guilt, morals, passion and insecurities. David Kross, in his first English role, is a talent way beyond his age; an unbelievable gifted young actor who still has so much to give."The Reader" is one of the best movies I`ve ever seen, great direction, production, and a well chosen cast (especially Bruno Ganz as professor Rohl who says :" there is a difference between law and morality").Ignore all the bad reviews accusing Winslet of abusing and corrupting young Michael. If only, these narrow minded people got to be corrupted by Winslet, they might've become more mature men!

If you want to know what Jihad meant in the Arabic world, when the world still had values, this movie, by the brilliant filmmaker Akkad paints a spectacular mural of that world; approach it with an open mind.Omar Mukhtar's story, one of several masterpieces Akkad created during his life, was a great choice by him. Mukhtar the old man, who led the resistance against the Italian occupation for 22 years, is a living legend in the Arabic world. Thanks to Gratiziani's obsession with media, all confrontations with the small number of Libyan fighters, as well as the concentration camps that Gratisiani established in Libya, were thoroughly documented.When Akkad produced and directed this movie in 1981, there was no misunderstanding about what Jihad was, and the association of terrorism with Islam did not exist. Jihad in every nation, not necessarily Arabic nations, is about struggle in life. The movie simply portrayed documented traits of Mukhtar. Mukhtar demonstrates the true meaning of Jihad by showing wisdom, patience and honor. Mukhtar's fight was a self defense act directed against an invading army not civilians.Mukhtar's fighters struggled against the Italian Army, just like Native Americans struggled against invaders. Any nation's right of independence is a right that doesn't need justification.The Libyans tying their legs when fighting until death instead of running away, is a heroic act not a suicidal one. Like Mukhtar said: "to choose death when defending your land, your freedom, is to choose life for ever".It's about time we separate religion from people, political games from faith; pedophiliac priests are not an indictment against all of Catholicism, fascist governments are not always a true representation of a nation's people, Fanatical religious Israeli settlers do not define Judaism, radical zealots beheading unarmed civilians does not pertain to Islam. We need to understand the good vs. the bad, terrorism vs. Jihad, life vs. death, Moustapha Akkad vs. Osama bin Laden.Moustapha Akkad, an educated, open minded Syrian man, who chose to live his life using his wealth to educate people, and enrich the entertainment industry by making movies such as Lion of the Desert. Bin Laden chose to live his life fighting civilians and teaching how to defeat armies by killing civilians (in the name of religion), which brought widespread opprobrium to Islam. Was it a coincidence, that Akkad was killed in a terrorist attack in Jordan in 2005? Akkad, the man of peace and love went there to meet his daughter for a family wedding, but they both died when the wedding hall was bombed.What can I say about Anthony Quinn? Does a man who portrayed Zorba in "Zorba the Greek"need any praise from Medusa? Lion of the Dessert, which Quinn blessed with his acting genius helped make the movie a complete masterpiece. Even the best story is uninspiring if not properly told.I hope this movie will be an eye opener. It is a thought provoking movie directed by a man of peace, who worked with a large number of fabulous artists all over the world to tell the story of Libya's struggle against the Italian invasion. A struggle that was coincident with suffering of the Italian people under Mussolini's dictatorship.

Depending on your tolerance for pain, mind numbing arrogance and stupidity, you might not want to see another minute of George Bush, but with Will Ferrell starring in this final hour as Bushy, you might change your mind.With all the pain and suffering we endured during Bush's 8 years, we deserve saying good bye with a smile.

In this unique movie, Ari Folman tells the story of the Sabra and Shatila massacres in 1982 as it has never been told before. The Israeli soldiers were dragged by their government to be the unwilling accomplices to this massacre, watching the killing of civilians and feeling helpless during a war they didn't understand, against an enemy they didn't know. George Steiner said it perfectly: "Men are accomplices to that which leaves them indifferent."It's not the agony of Israeli soldiers alone, but the too often repeated story of young men dragged to war by their government for reasons they do not comprehend. It's very similar to current traumas of young men who can't cope with their life after the war.

Schneider plays the role of Paul, a car salesman with an addictive personality who degenerates into a meaningless life with no aim or hope. Paul gives up on his life and everybody he knew, and is surprised when a group of strangers visit him to tell him that he is the chosen one.The strangers traveled a long time to find the chosen one, who will bring the whole universe to the right balance. In a state of complete disbelief, Paul tries to convince them that they are wrong and he's only a loser.Take a gamble with your time and see if he will convince them they are wrong or if he is truly the chosen one, maybe each one of us could be the "chosen one" in this crazy world.This is a more serious role for Schneider, where he shows his serious side but doesn't obscure the humor for which he is famous. This is a funny movie with a very serious and sweet message, you won't regret watching it!

Based on the real life story of Michael Oher, this movie successfully details Michael's pain, struggles, and emotions. Sandra Bullock shines as Leigh Ann Tuhoy; Michael's adoptive mom and deserves all the praise she received for her amazing performance. The movie also describes the rumors speculating the Tuhoys's motives regarding Michael's adoption, and how the great family dealt with it!One of the funniest accusations against the movie is being racist! Just like people can't accept that goodness might still exist, they can't see people of different colors treating each other with respect without questioning their intentions.This is a great movie to watch and to keep!

Emma is a typical unrealistic romantic girl, who sees love as the solution to all her problems and the answer to all her dreams of wealth and fame. Emma finds married life and attending expensive parties as the doctor's wife very disappointing. She compares herself to the wealthy people at these parties and becomes very depressed and angry at her husband for not fulfilling her dreams of wealth and fame. Emma becomes the center of the story when she begins her adulterous love affairs in an attempt to bring passion, romance and fulfillment to her empty life. At the end, faced with the emptiness of her fantasies, Emma, makes a tragic decision still hoping for a romantic ending, but that goes badly as wellEven motherhood was disappointing for Emma, as she had hoped for a boy but gave birth to a girl Many of Emma's actions were compulsive in every way and her interaction with her little girl was obviously cruel and selfish.Emma couldn't see the reality of any person in her life; she over estimated the passion of her lovers, even the sexual attraction between her and Rodolph got cold, even the pleasure of overspending money didn't last. Her husband and child, the only people true to her, were in front of her all of her life but she didn't see it. Was the reason again the hunter/prey nature of human beings? If Charles didn't give her unconditional love, would she not notice his love like she did? If she wasn't that cruel, would Charles idolize her like he did? Are the people who live their lives unnoticed like Charels destined to be like that for the rest of their lives? If Charles had known the true Emma from the beginning, wouldn't he still love her as much and do whatever she wanted to please her?I don't know about all the emotional conflicts of human beings, but I know that Flaubert was an artist who presented his obnoxious character Emma in a fascinating and very readable way..Eight years ago, and again recently, I was unable to put the book down until I finished reading it..

Bill Maher, the timid observer, always has something to say about politics and society.I was always amazed by how obvious his observations were, and how blind people choose to be.True, be more cynical is few years old, but it is as funny and accurate as "The Decider".Finally some body agrees with me on the big deal made over Clinton's scandal, Lady Diana's image, Al Gore, Reagan, and Bush junior, especially junior. Listen to Bill's observations about advertisement, drugs, republicans, death, religion (how religions are manipulated by people and how faith in God doesn't necessarily lead you to religion), aging (menopause = men on pause), the protected classes and their double standards (especially women), Barbie and Ken (Ken comes separately), and the male agenda "men are as loyal as their options, women should stop complaining about men until they develop better taste in them.....".I especially enjoy how Bill reacts when some audience rudely interrupts him, I actually wish for that to happen. I just love how witty and ready Bill is; even Medusa might not keep up with him.When Maher refers to Clinton's levels of lies, it finally occurred to me why people like Maher don't choose politics; they simply can't lie. I believe the world would be much better if more clean minds like Maher existed.

A group of outstanding scholars create their case for the connection between quantum physics and consciousness; while simultaneously describe the spiritual journey of Amanda (Marlee Matlin).The movie raises some profound questions about reality, addiction, spirituality, emotions and God. I don't think the conclusions are necessarily correct but they are, however, quite intriguing and worth pondering.My favorite part of the document is the question:" if we can't control our emotion, is it possible that we are addicted to them and maybe we can change them?" Also, the animated part was hilarious and quite convincing, see for yourself!

I watched Mr. Osteen deliver his inspirational speeches to his lucky followers (including his message to the non believers that he still loves them and prays for their survival) with the slimy loquaciousness and dubitable credibility of a traveling medicine man. Watching the clueless masses listen to and follow his B.S, only reinforced my view that humans are hopeless species.You can reach God without the intervention of Joel Osteen and his narcissistic wife, Victoria. Even if we are not smart enough to know that, I think God is kinder than us, and wouldn't use our stupidity to enhance the Osteens' wealth.I bought this book out of cynical curiosity to see if Joel Osteen had become more creative in his money making schemes, but no, this book is just another round of Joel and Victoria, God's self-appointed messengers to humanity, twisting the bible's words and working their own way.If you are a Christian, reading the bible is a much better way to reach God or find your way. If you are not Christian and can't relate to the quotes that Osteen is using to make his case, trust me, God is every where for you to communicate with, and you don't need Osteen's words to find your purpose.At the end of the book, Joel and Victoria said to the readers that they love them. Touching, but Joel and Victoria please refund my money.

There are many musical icons that I adore and to whose voice or music I was instantly attracted. Admittedly, there were some musical tracks that I needed to replay in order to understand them. As long as the element of good music/talent is there, the artist is granted a space to explore different horizons and new musical experiences, a good example of that is Mario Franguolis' new Album "follow your heart", where Mario wanted put his personal stamp of values and music.I don't mind young artists who respect the audience's taste and work hard to perform and please. Some failures in finding the right words/music or finding that personal touch should be forgiven when the talent exists, but these four young men, who have nothing but youth, are not singers. I don't care how many poses they strike on the stage or how expensive their suites are, they are pathetically just boys screaming randomly. I felt sorry for the musicians who played on the stage and for myself for wasting valuable time opening and watching that DVD.I remember how wonderfully Andrea Bocelli sang the songs of Neil Diamond and Elvis, and how respectfully Mario Frangoulis sang "nights in white satin". It is sad how great pop hits like "unbreak my heart" was tortured by these four boys.The geniuses that created this DVD as a quick money making scheme, should be indicted for crimes against musicality for inflicting this tortuous musical m&eacute;lange on humanity.I experienced total disbelief watching, the relatively small audience, crying and dancing to that singing (I'm kind of embarrassed calling it singing). The ladies are probably the boys' mothers and the mothers' girl friends.Nothing personal, but when it comes to music and books, I just can't compromise.

You would think the topic is thought provoking; in a world where nobody ever lied, a man is "liberated" and finally discovers lying. Not true; the jokes are lame and predictable, and Ricky Gervais is decidedly not funny.In a world that is disgustingly stuffed with lies, it is more refreshing to imagine the effects of not lying. That's why I think that " Liar, Liar" is a smart and hilarious movie. "The invention of lying" is a seriously flawed imitation of "Liar Liar". A great chasm exists between Ricky Gervais' performance and the amazingly funny and smart performance of Jim Carrey in Liar,,Liar.

In beyond good and evil, Nietzsche simply rejects all dogmatism and argues against any fixed understanding of "the truth". "perspectivism"; which is Nietzsche's point of view assumes that absolute truth does not exist, but rather there are equally valid perspectives of any perceived truth. In that way, Nietzsche relegates philosophical foundations, especially Plato's teaching, to the rubbish heap of childish fantasy for relying on assumptions that can't be proven. Nietzsche heavily criticizes Plato's ideals of pure spirit and the form of the good, and condemns Christianity as "Platonism for the people"Nietzsche's main issue with Platonism, or any dogma or faith, is that it enslaves one's mind to a fixed understanding, without having that understanding proved or justified. This book is a dictate from Nietzsche, in which he demands that the reader discard any previous assumptions, and open his/her mind in order to separate from "the herd". "The herd" is Nietzsche's title for people who lack individual will and live by group instincts like herd animals.Nietzsche's own sister used his early death to manipulate his writings. She distorted his opinions and selectively published his writing to support her pro-Nazi and anti Semitic views. The publishing of this work by Nietzsche, in which Nietzsche criticizes socialism, anti-Semitism, and the nihilism of Europe, at a time when values were totally abandoned and overwhelmed by blind faith, racism, fascism and blind belief of the superiority of science, vindicated one of the most misunderstood philosophers.Nietzsche brilliantly explains how any one can become a "free spirit"; a noble, free and un-dogmatic person. "sublimation", which is repressing one's desires and instincts is how a person can have control over his/her will of power. The will of power, if uncontrolled can result in rape, killing and hatred, but once controlled it can result in deeper, stronger "free spirit". The most fascinating part is Nietzsche's revelation of his own prejudices against women, as an example of how deep human prejudices are. Nietzsche actually presents the case that a strong person is a person who is strong enough to discipline himself and to admit his most inner weakness like he did.The ending poem, or "after song", is about a man who became a" free spirit" living on top of a mountain, where all his friends are leaving him after giving up trying to understand him. Admittedly, the poem is weak and chaotic, but I think that was intended by Nietzsche to be a reflection of his inner noble "free spirit"; a solitary, suffering, and misunderstood soul that is ever changing.It is interesting that Nietzsche, the free spirit who longed for a friend all of his life, died alone after spending most of his physical deterioration phase in the Alps; on a mountain just like the "free spirit" in Nietzsche's " beyond good and evil".I suggest that any skeptical reader, who wants to approach Nietzsche's work should open his/her mind, abandon any previous assumptions, let go of any religious dogmas, and try to understand Nietzsche's perspective instead of judging it. The key to understanding Nietzsche's analytical nature and even his anger towards women or society is to know the details of his life and the moral, political and social nature of that period in Europe. The beauty of most philosophical works is that they were written by thinkers, who had a life experience different than ours. Enjoy.

Other than the real encouraging, funny way that Greg and Amiira Behrendt tell these stories, they are all based on just common sense rules.Some might claim that it's not rocket science to know that you shouldn't call your ex, but the truth that when we are broken hearted, we can't even go through life, let alone using common sense.This book would be wonderful for you if you got out of the shock phase and got into the grieving stage. It might even help you understand that it's time to get out of the shock phase as it did to me.These sections of pure accurate symptoms don't apply to one gender; they apply to broken hearted people who had their dreams terminated, regardless if they were dumped or if they ended the relationship.I highly recommend this book to every body that went through putting themselves out there because they believed in love, now it's time to believe in yourself and know that you have so much to offer and as Greg and Amiira say: "remember, doubt means don't". Let's face it; we all had our doubts about relationships that later didn't work, doubts were there but blinded with love.Stop wondering why, there are simply no answers. As mentioned in the book, trying to figure out why will only lead to more hurt and more pain.

I always wondered if Dr. Hannibal Lecter would be as fascinating and intriguing if not for Anthony Hopkins' performance in previous movies. Even As perfect as Hopkins' performance was, I think this great production of Hannibal rising rises to the same level of previous Hannibal movies and makes the book by Thomas Harris's a living novel.The evolution of Hannibal's evil is captured flawlessly through great music, direction, production and the outstanding performance of the cast, especially Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal and Gong Li as Lady Murasaki. It is amazing how the physical and emotional attraction between these two characters captured by the camera through their looks and body language. This view provided by the camera was more profound and telling than any possible dialogue.In spite of all the criticism that was directed at "Hannibal rising" when compared to Harris' original novel, I don't think that this movie could have been any better; highly recommended

This man is absolutely hilarious; he doesn't look like it, which is an unexpected aspect of his performance. Gaffigan doesn't talk about politics or significant aspects of life, but about daily and traditional things that nobody notices. I've seen his show many times, alone and with friends and I can't stop laughing each and every time. Gaffigan's clean language gives him such a classy style that no other comedian has.

"Footfalls echo in the memory down the passage which we did not take towards the door we never opened into the rose-garden."-T.S.EliottI devoured Ahlam Mosteghanemi's "Memory in the Flesh" in Arabic in one night in 1999. It was impossible to put it down without finishing. The emotional journey, I experienced with this novel, left me dizzy, in much the same way the great late poet, Nizzar Kabbani described his reaction to this masterpiece. Now, the author is being accused, by some reviewers, of being a carbon copy of the great late poet Nizzar Kabbani. I simply smile and think how wonderful it is that Nizzar got to read this piece of art before his death and acknowledged the uniqueness of Mosteghanemi's talent. He died knowing that the language of love and peace is universal and will live onI kept the Arabic version of "Memory in the Flesh" next to my bed, with my favorite lines highlighted until it was translated into English. I doubted that the English translation would be felicitous to the original Arabic and maintain the power of a novel that is very dear to my heart. To my surprise, it took me one night to finish the English translation and to highlight nearly the identical lines that captured my heart in Arabic. I had to share this novel with all my close friends and professors, and now that I read ignorant cruel comments about the first novel written by an Algerian woman in Arabic, I am compelled to defend a great novel and a special author.After reading several reviews about this book, I decided that I will not read any reviews ever until I have written my own. Other's confused reviews only distract me from the work and make me focus on defending it instead. I read the ignorant reaction of a reader who actually describes this novel with these words that some of which don't even sound English: " "This is one horrid, long, sombre dark night of the soul piece of work in which both mosochism and saism converge", "watan", a word that gets tritely overused throughout the whole theme of the novel". Its ok, to criticize parts of any novel, but the absolute and uneducated nature of the remarks really got to me this time. This novel is not simply a love story; it lays the pain of the Algerian people as they try to understand how long years of struggle against invasion was replaced by native dictators, who were as bad as the invading government. The word "watan" or "home land" was used to describe the desire for a homeland. The word must be used frequently to describe the feelings experienced by those who couldn't stay in their newly independent countries because they felt alienated there. They were treated as outsiders in every other place they went and became strangers in and out of their homeland.I remember great thinkers who died without being appreciated or even noticed, and smile thinking of Kafka who didn't want to publish his work in fear that people would not understand. I also pray for peace upon the souls of thinkers like Nietzsche who lost their sanity in an insane world, and just think to my self:" Ignorance is a blessing, and only unblessed people can recogniz that ignorance.In few decades, I am confident that mankind will grow sick and tired constantly consuming ready feelings and the phoenix of passion and simple pleasures will rise again. Only then, will Ahlam Mosteghanemi be appreciated as she deserves to be.Enjoy a wonderful and pleasurable read, and wait for the surprise of the next book "Chaos of Senses", which only recently became available in English. I'm hoping the English speaking readers will give this master piece a try and feel the magic.

Just like all the followers of the intelligent design theory, who try to search for the presence of God through science; Lee Strobel takes the same approach through a series of interviews with his guests. As the skeptic that Lee Strobel trys to present himself, I assumed that he would interview experts on both sides and compare their observations, but he sticks to "experts" who mostly are Christians and strongly disagree with Darwin's theory. This alone made me admire the other documentary "Expelled: No Intelligence allowed" simply for the fact that those with opposing claims were interviewed.The statement that man had evolved from monkeys; is not a correct interpretation of Darwin's ideas. Darwin's claim is that both modern monkeys and man evolved from a common primate ancestor. Not that I agree or disagree, but here we need to study the details of Darwin's theory before we start to discredit it. This is the minimal requirement for a scholar in the search for truth. I tried to be patient and watch all discussions, and thank "the creator" that the document ended. I still can't get over the discussion of the Evidence of Consciousness and how evolution can't explain consciousness or free will. Please keep in mind that consciousness is a relatively new research area and proving or disproving of evolution doesn't mean an intelligent designer is the only answer. If we want to discuss science, the least we can do is provide scientific evidence to substantiate our claim. The lack of evidence doesn't prove much. I guess that's why faith is called faith; you simply can't create enough scientific evidence to make people believe in God.Even though the arguments simply address the claim that a creator of some sort must exist, but after investigating Mr. Strobel's other work the viewer can safely conclude that the creator that Mr. Strobel is referring to is a Christian God. Man, all other humans who believe in a creator (not a certain religion) are doomed now:( At least we should be very thankful for Mrs. Strobel's conversion to Christianity that enabled this work of rare genius.I try not to judge based on looks, so I watched the entire DVD and concluded that Mr. Strobel is not smarter than he looks. Don't take my word for it, and watch for yourself. It is interesting to see how people with different logic than us operate. Very interesting!

Aniston and Vaughn are a couple who shared love and chemistry, but drift apart because of their stubborn egos and break up while living together.As funny and awkward the situations and dialog of the movie are, it is in essence a dark comedy that reflects how damaging people can be to themselves and their loved ones.I think any body can relate to this movie and see how things could've been different in every relationship in their lives. Watch and think, will you do things differently if the clock could be rewinded?

A man, who helps people cope with their losses, must face his personal denial of pain. It is a touchingly sweet movie but the idea of making it a romantic comedy was decision made by a vacant mind. The jokes are not funny and Aaron Eckhart is awkward whilst when trying to be funny. The mistakes can be overlooked, and the movie can be worth watching, considering the excellent topic and Jennifer Aniston's performance.

L'enfer or Hell is a philosophical novel dealing with solipsism and existentialism. The release of "Hell" in English started a burning scandal because of its depiction of voyeurism. The story revolves around a young man in a Paris boarding house peeking through a hole in his bedroom wall to witness love, death, adultery, and birth in the most graphic way.The topic or the actions described are not the reason for the greatness of this work, rather it is the way this young man describes regular daily eventsEndless unforgettable scenes like the helpless exposed position of a woman during childbirth, two doctors discussing a health condition of a dying man, a man discussing religion/God right before his death, two lovers trying to escape emptiness through desire and fantasy. The greatness of the scenes is not the act as much as Barbusse's language:* "And I think about myself, about myself who can neither know myself well nor get rid of myself; about myself who am like a heavy shadow between my heart and the sun"* "Nothing can prevail against the absolute statement that I exist and cannot emerge from my self"* "What's the matter? Nothing is the matter. It's just me"* "Humanity is the longing for novelty combined with the fear of death"* "God is merely a ready-made reply to mystery and hope, and there is no other reason for the reality of God but our longing for it"I don't usually include phrases of the work itself in my reviews, but I'm making an exception for readers like me, who might be fascinated by Barbusse's use of language.Whether Barbusse intended to deal with existentialism or solipsism or simply the inner hell of a total cynic, he created an absolutely brilliant work; the likes of which has no equal.Philosophical ideas fall in and out of fashion with time, but the way an idea is delivered, as exemplified by Barbusse, can have a significant impact on how that idea is initially received and how it lives on. Barbusse's Hell is a timeless, great work.

Or did the friendship save both friends? Watch and see! This film delivers a journey of incomparable intensity. I would watch it ad infinitum.

Between surveillance, briefing the client, the confrontation, and using big words, "Cheaters" will grab your attention and entertain you in a sick sort of way.Joey Greco, the host, is my favorite part of the show; he even fooled me a few times into believing how much he cares about the deceived victims! It is a fact though, that the show is hilarious between using dramatic words, Joey Greco, and the crazy reactions of people.I'm kind of embarrassed saying that I liked it, but it still makes me laugh and for that alone, it is worth watching.

What a great performance! I was unequivocal in my delusion that I was the only individual who belonged in this picture with Ralph Finesse, so I was shocked to see Susan Sarandon shine so brightly by his side; they are remarkable!The story, the performance, watching Ralph Finesse hit the hookah and get drunk, it's all priceless.

Anti-Climacus, the pseudonym that Kierkegaard used in this work, defines sickness as the despair that each person experiences whether he/she knows it or not. The feeling of despair is associated with being alive; the only way to overcome despair is death or infinite faith in God.Kierkegaard analyzes different types of despair and the origins of despair in such lengthy complicated and tedious detail, that I just wanted to tell him: chill and have a drink man, but admittedly, he fully engaged my mind, especially, when he reached the conclusion that despair is a direct result of self awareness. A body and brain makes a person but not a self. A self is one's relationships with self, others and God. Relating to oneself constitutes self awareness and the stronger one's faith is the stronger his/her self awareness.The most interesting part of Kierkegaard's discussion is his understanding of the will. The will is synonymous with the self that binds a person's different aspect into one whole. However, for Kierkegaard, the inability to make a choice is equivalent to the ability to make a choice. The self is the will, or possibly, the lack of will.Kierkegaard is one of the first thinkers who wrote about despair or the sickness associated with existence, which is likely the reason he is associated with existentialism. The reader might hear this despair's echo in Sartre's Nausea and Camus' Absurdity. Still, Kierkegaard uniquely explores and presents his philosophy about being, existence and faith but like others before and after him he gets stuck in endless intellectual circles.

The scary experience of anesthesia awareness is perfectly performed by Hayden Christenson and complimented by the rest of the wonderful cast. Whether anesthesia awareness is a repeated mistake or an imaginary problem, it is still worth pondering and this movie did a great job of providing material.With all the flaws in the plot and the unanswered questions, the great performance and the ending surprises are worth the time. Christenson, Alba and Lena Olin all shine in a story of love, loyalty and betrayal.

It's hard to make a movie as good as the book, especially "He's Just Not That into You" by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. However; director Ken Kwapis did a great job creating a more personalized and emotional stories!We impetuous humans view relationships as an exception to all the common sense rules especially when we fall in love. The funny part is that we do it every time thinking that this time is somehow completely different. We continue to over analyze and complicate the obvious: If somebody is into us, they will simply show it! Clearly it is less science than we all might imagine and very given to our acquired delusions.Something must be said about clever movies that use jokes and laughter to present complex and confusing subjects like love, relationships, and humans' infinite stupidity! This is a great and smart movie that is worth every minute!

The movie tells the story of a childhood friendship in Afghanistan that is interrupted by a sad incident and explores the possibility of redemption and the correction of past mistakes.The scenery and direction of the movie are fascinating, aside from the extremely annoying subtitles which detracted from my enjoyment of the movie:1-They were light with a light back ground.2-They didn't last on the screen long enough to be read3-worst of all , the subtitles had some Islamic words that aren't English as the English translation. for example: an Afghani statement that meant God's willing was translated as inshallah which is the Arabic translation of the Islamic term: God's willing. Aren't subtitles intended to translate to a language the viewer understands? So how about the brilliant idea of writing God's willing instead of Inshallah.Finally, that mistake was fixed and later in the movie, Arabic and different Afghani words were actually translated into English.My initial problem with the story is not the idea of fear or occasional cowardliness or the possibility of redemption, but that the incident that inflicted such immense pain on one of the children is too graphic and cruel. I understand the concept of bullies and evil, that art and movies should reflect negative aspects as well as positive ones. I can also understand the sexual feelings and curiosities that children might experience and I will understand if a movie focuses on that, but my problem was watching the sexual pain and humiliation inflicted on one child by another child.The sad incident that happen to one of the two friends was actually performed by other kids. Of course, a lot of attention was given in previous movies to sexual predators and evil killers, but the idea of kids inflicting sexual pain at the attacked target (whether it's another child or an animal or any being) is still beyond me.I think the reason movie directors do this far more now than in the past is because we have become immune to simple shocks and subtle implied barbarity. Some times, people need to be shaken in order to wake up.I admittedly confess that cruelty against children upsets me deeply, so I have to accept that scenes of brutality are needed to show the extent of the humiliation and savagery. I will try to be more open minded and focus on the moral issues and the idea of justice and redemption.Now, I'll move to my positive notes and they are actually many:1-I was drawn to continue watching the movie because with the development of the story, one can actually understand the corrupted character of the offensive bully involved in the rape incident, and the child hood incident becomes more convincing as we come to know the perpetrator.2-The actors were great, especially the father (Homayoun Ershadi), but his character seemed to be in conflict with the secret that was revealed later in the story.With a character that is so wise, truthful, and manly, I just find it hard to believe that he would leave Hassan behind and take only Amir. Granted, flaws should be over looked in great works like this movie, so for the great purpose of showing the Taliban's cruelty and immersing the viewer in the Afghani culture, a few plot contradictions must be forgiven.3-Most scenes of the Afghani emigrants were so touching and powerful in showing how all cultures are similar in some ways.The actual prayers in Arabic, the wedding scene, and the father in the bar made me cry and smile at the same time.4-The scenes in Afghanistan and the scenes of Taliban's cruelty were as close to the truth as possible. Showing the actions of this corrupted government was truly brave. Knowing how close this is to the truth should make us really admire this movie.The stoning scene, the child abuse, using religion to manipulate people's minds, covering up women in a humiliating way and depriving them from education are all a dictatorship's way of controlling people. I really hope that the viewers of this movie can be mature enough to separate the actions and beliefs. Religions shouldn't be blamed for the bad actions of people, only people should be blamed for their bad actions.5-Finally, two powerful scenes that I can't get out of my head: the scene of the sexually abused child on the stairs talking about his feelings about the abuse, and the scene were the orphanage director was describing how he would give one child to be abused in order to have other kids saved.Despite all my objections, I have to admit that this movie is very strong, powerful, and shocking. I'm still shocked and drained emotionally over the experience of watching "The Kite Runner", but such is life. If one can't handle the truth, they should go to the circus instead of watching such a movie.

Joshua Payne is a great young talent, who possesses a wonderful unique voice, but I could not help but notice some sadness in that enchanting voice.Nice Music, nice words, but all the songs have the same style. I expect more success from future albums, if he gets more support and attention.

To this collection of Sarah's great songs, the only thing I would have added is more of her wonderful singlesThis version of "A Question of Honor" is in the best I have heard, and listening to Steve Harley sing "Phantom of the Opera" with Sarah is a spectacular addition to the album as well.

The Syrian bride is a Druze woman from the Golan Heights, (Syrian land that fell under Israeli occupation in 1967) who is getting married to a Druze man, who lives in Syria.While getting to know the members of the bride's family, one can observe the struggle of people who are still loyal to the government of Syria but living under the authority of Israeli government. Once the movie gets to the point where she has to cross the border where the Israeli officials insist on stamping the passport as coming from Israel, and the Syrian officials insist on rejecting the stamp because the Golan Heights are Syrian land. Watching the detail that vacillate between bitter and comic, and wondering who's more stubborn, the Israelis or the Syrian, I was thrilled that the director chose to give an open ending, just like the struggle of these people.This work witnesses the work of Israeli, Syrian, and Palestinian actors which is a great step in the process of peace (if anybody still remember it).

I have had this tape for few years, and it has always been useful to me when I need to target my arms and shoulder's muscles for improvement. Before purchasing this tape you should know (Which is also recommended by Denis Austin for any program targeting specific spots) that Aerobic exercise should not be ignored and this program doesn't replace it. Another important aspect to remember is that at some point, your muscles will adapt to these moves and when that happens you need to introduce another routines or positions to maximize the results of this work out.The need to build muscle strength and aerobic exercise are well known by anybody that's into fitness. Targeting any spot is possible using this series but it should be accompanied by aerobic and mixed with other routines later on.

Have you ever been betrayed by a loved one? Had your heart hurt so badly so long as you dwelled on the reason for the betrayal? Did your heart hurt badly enough until it became physical pain? Did it hurt so horribly that you imagined it would stop but sadly it didn't? Then this book is for you.The author of this book is not an amateur who, seeking profit, wrote a number of books on the subject. Flanigan.is a therapist, who devoted her career of over twenty years to this subject. Also, this book is a result of a multiple year study on a large number of patients who experienced moral injuries.What is very refreshing about this book is the Author's realistic description of a moral injury. . Not all injured people are innocent victims, some of them accept their responsibility and faults in the relationship, but still hurt for being betrayed by a loved one. The moral injuries discussed don't apply only to male/female intimate relationships, but to family members, friends and any person with whom a close relationship required or implied a mutual moral code.What hurts the most is that the offender has been chosen and loved by the offended. The pain is exacerbated because the offender has in their mind justified and excused all their actions and exonerated themselves.Reading about the symptoms that the injured can experience, will help any person suffering through the pain realize that they have not yet lost their mind. In an effort to cope with the loss and in a desperate hopeless attempt to right the wrong, a person might experience: endless nights of sleep loss, rapid weight loss, heavy drinking, endless crying spells, crazy calls begging or blaming the offender, and loss of friends and family over not ending the cycle of pain and grieving. The offended will experience a mix of feelings: anger, hate, love, guilt, and even repeated hot physical interactions with the betraying ex or partner, followed by long crying spells. After all, the overwhelming feelings are accompanied by a strong need to reclaim what once belonged to the hurt person, especially if he/she was betrayed by and ex or a spouse.Flanigan pointedly says that the injured will experience disbelief and will feel betrayed by the whole world. The feelings of being let down will become so intense and painful that the injured feels his/her core beliefs have failed them. According to Flanigan; the only way to recover from the shock is to accept this change to one's moral values. This particular point led to many reviewers attacking Flanigan, arguing that the offender not the values is what caused the injury.I think what Flanigan intended is accepting that our values no longer apply to the relationship with the offender, and are still good moral values. If we accept that our values have been violated and assaulted, that doesn't harm the values, but rather the image of the offender. After all; Love is the rule, and betrayal is the exception.The seemingly infinite cycle of pain, guilt, anger and even love becomes so draining that it needs to be broken by any means possible before it destroys the injured emotionally. That is when it is imperative that a choice be taken between forgiveness and forgetfulness. As humans, none of us have the capacity or the privilege to forgive others; I think that's God's right not humans. However, we can choose to forgive ourselves and move on with a permanent scar on our heart.Read this book and see if it works. If you can forgive the offender, then more power to you. If you can not forgive the offender then it might help if you forgive yourself for your weakness, for not seeing all the screaming writing on the walls, and for keeping the offender around after the betrayal. If you were injured by a loved one, it's not easy to forgive, as Lord Chesterfield said: "Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it forever". The truth though is that we need to forgive ourselves, and this book will help. If you are an offender, you need not read this book. Sadly, you have concocted your own reality and forgiven yourself.

I try to avoid watching concerts for the fear of being distracted from the music by lights, fashion, and fake dramatics. Watching Bocelli's concert definitely changed my mind about television viewing of concerts.It's hard to select the best song, but the great performance of "CANTO DELLA TERRA" with Sarah Brightman, "VIVERE" with Laura Pausini and "LA VOCE DEL SILENZIO" with Elisa surely stand out, so much so that they became my favorite night lullabys. Maybe it's only me, but I couldn't help noticing that Brightman and Bocelli are old friends that very much enjoy working together. Also, while watching VIVERE, I just couldn't help but noticing how Bocelli's face lit up when hearing Pausini's voice, a great performance that looked to me like love making in highest form.Only a musical giant like Bocelli can be humble enough to get that number of talents to share the spotlight in his concert like Kenny G, Heather Headley, Chris Botti, and Lang Lang. Elisa and Lang Lang were given the opportunity of using Bocelli's stage to perform their own works, which added more to the glorious concert and just reinforced my view of Andrea Bocelli's humility and generosity.Discovering talents like Lang Lang and Elisa in this concert is a great pleasure to add to the enjoyment of experiencing Bocelli's "Live in Tuscany" enchanted night.

We all know the life story of this crazy man; Hitler, and the story of his demise as well. The most wonderful thing about this movie is watching Anthony Hopkins, with his infinite talents in full display, going crazy portraying Hitler. You will become absorbed in every scene that is graced by Hopkins' presence. The only statement to adequately describe Hopkins' performance is "complete perfection". It is a must have movie.

My favorite comedian as always says it as it is. The double standard of our culture propagates empty slogans but never puts them to action, publicly puts the men down and tries to boost women's ego, even when we all know how horribly women are treated in work places. In short, Maher is striping naked the lies and showing the truth as it is.This man has a beautiful mind, so enjoy the laughter while thinking: are married people happy? Do we really support our troops? Do we really respect our politicians? Do you really understand the real reasons behind the wars we are involved in???It's kind of about time that we start questioning what we are told.

Knowing that the movie is written by Woody Allen, there was a risk of wasting time watching it. I took the risk knowing that the nice scenery in Barcelona and Scarlett Johansson's performance would help redeem any plot defects, and I wasn't mistaken.The plot is simply every man's dream of having beautiful women chasing after him, which can be easily explained, knowing that Woody Allen is the writer. What is so wonderful though is that this story reveals how delusional we ladies are for falling for stupid bad boys, who have nothing to offer (not even wit or looks) and compromising our self respect and even our simplest rights, while turning down good guys.Johansson's performance and her emotional conclusion at the end makes this film worth watching in order to find out that even if we make mistakes, we don't have to suffer and keep repeating the same mistake and if we can't or don't know what we want, we can at least find out what we don't want.

Listening to Bocelli sing great songs previously performed by other great singers was a pleasurable addition to a wonderful musical concert. There is no need to compare his performance with others, it's simply a different experience of great ageless songs like: can't help falling in love, September Morn, Somos Novios,.....The most pleasant surprise to me, was hearing Bocelli sing Les Feuilles Mortes in French; one of my favorite childhood songs. I just wish that the great voice who accompanied him was at least credited on the cover.All in all, a great concert that is worth replaying and treasuring on cold Friday nights.

FBI agents investigate terrorism related crime scenes and encounter serious life threatening incidents that eventually raise very important questions? Where and how al-Qaeda started? How is it related to the Gulf War and oil business? Why are we all blind to the obvious? And why this hell will never end if we don't achieve universal political maturity?Enjoy the action packed scenes and be patient until the final scene that reveals the secret craziness, which is more complex than it seems. I hope that viewers will be open minded enough to understand the hidden message and not get tangled in yet another cycle of hatred.

This book is one of the few books (along with calculus and other basic professional books) that I used in college and still use today.The three main three religions; Judaism, Christianity and Islam, along with other philosophical and religious traditions are explained in a clear unbiased way. I, specifically, learned a lot about Taoism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Books of this sort help people understand each others' customs and motives and make tolerance an achievable task instead of an impossible one.

The details of the movie slowly unfold to reveal the truth behind the cold appearance of a woman with a mysterious past.Admittedly, the plot has defects but the magnificent performance of Kristin Scott Tomas made up for any flaws. This story of a broken hearted mother is highly recommended for the emotionally mature audience. No offense to the emotionally deficient masses.

Jose Cura's performance of several Verdi arias is intensely pleasing to the ear and soul. In particular, when Cura flawlessly delivers the psychological drama we associate with the character Manrico.Cura is accompanied by the Philharmonia Orchestra and the experience could only be improved by hearing and watching Cura live on stage.
