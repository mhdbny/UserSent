A reviewer wrote that he couldn't respect Peter because he was an egomaniac. Wrong. Peter loved Bob, but wanted people tostop living in the past and to accept him for who he was andwhere he wanted to go. He did not attend Bob's funeral. Iwonder how he would want to be remembered considering howviolently he died? This album was one of many great solorecords...there were a few bad ones as well.

We knew Peter was going to deliver something truly awesome after Security.1987 was a huge year in so many ways for music. The '80s would not have been the decade they were without this record. The production stellar. The musicians were the finest around. The sounds were high tech and world beat. They all came together. I will never forget this record and the tour that followed. peter delivered a blistering Red Rain at Amensty.

Having bought the last 5 or 6 Iggy discs, I was really shocked by the material. I assumed, incorrectly, that it would be more of the same ala American Ceasar, Naughty little Doggy, and Brick by Brick. This album reminds us that at some time we all to have to pull up and take stock of life and living.

It's fine that Bruce chose not to mold this record like thelast E-Street band record, Born in the USA. After all, we're allolder and supposedly wiser. This record sounds like songs moredestined for TRACKS. There are some great songs. I found therest to be average.

I still have trouble listening to this album after all these years. Spector ruined what was really an OK effort, not great. I sense the HAND of Alan Klein at work, yet again. This may have been a final cash in, but the listener is left wondering 'what the hell happend here?' The only two songs that ever capture me are the George Harrison penned tunes. TO me, this album is personified by I,Me,Mine.

What a WASTE all these reviews written before the release! The sound and visual cleanup make this set WELL worth the price. I am a fan, a huge fan, who saw this in the theater in '82. I can tell you that it looks and sounds better than that original theatrical debut. I DO have a 50 inch plasma TV, but not HD playback so no blu ray or HD. BUT, even normal DVD playback is STUNNING. I've seen the final cut and its NOT a huge departure, but Ridley said, this is IT. Will move onto the other 4 versions shortly!

The true standouts are Phil Lynott penned Military Man and Run for cover. Besides being great rockers, these tunes have lyrics not common among the genre ie strong political themes. The musicanship is very strong. This was the peak period for Gary with After the War marking the end. Reach for the Sky as always been a personal favorite, especially as a live song.

Having heard this material via live recordings from his current tour, I was fairly certain that this album was going to be great. But, I didn't realize how great t'll I completed listening to it. Its always hard to move forward after having been in one of the most powerful and influential bands of an era. Certainly, The Clash are are a hard act to top. Joe has shown that he's more than capable of moving forward and not living in the shadow of his former Band. Hat's off to Joe Strummer!

As a follower of all things Bill Laswell and Buckethead, this is another treasure. Combine their participation, along with Nicky Skopelitas and Bernie Worrell, not to mention Robert Musso, and you're one step away from Axion Funk and Praxis. This is a truly magnificent disc that soars with engery and confidence. Kudos to Shin Terai and company.

My how time flies. Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie, is now a film director. The man who fell to earth comes to mind. Very interesting story where the plot comes before the technology. If you like tension, dialogue, and thought provoking scenes, this is a film for you. I hope we'll hear more from Duncan and maybe his famous Dad will pop up soon.

Just like every other person that bought Q2k, I'm a big fan. This is a very solid effort. Geoff Tate's voice is as strong as ever, which can also be said of the other members. But, that spark which separates this recording from Operation Mind Crime, Rage For Order, and Empire must be the departure of Chris De Garmo.

Some bands material just gets better with age. High Voltage shows not only what was to come but much furhter beyond other bands AC/DC were in 1976. Angus already had his chops well rehearsed and Bon was already a force to be reckoned with. Sad that he was headed on a path to final destruction and death. This album is chalked full of classics destined for constant radio and LIVE rotation with T.N.T., Live Wire, The Jack, and Its a long Way to the Top

There's a reason that Rolling Stone voted this one of the 100 best of the '80s. This album flat out rocks. Angus Young is one the finest hard blues riffers in the Biz. As the band was rehearsing these tracks with Bon Scott, I've always wondered what this album would have sounded like with him in a fully produced version.

Too many metal albums from the '80s and '90s are really starting to sound dated. The good new is that there are alot of bands that wish they sounded as good now as G'n'R did when this was released. Izzy and Axl were a formidable song writing combo. And prior to Izzy leaving, things were really looking up. Matt certainly fit well into the band after the departure of the old drummer. Strange that he was booted out for substance abuse....but I digress.This album has as many good tunes as UYI2. The fact that there are two albums is testament to the fact that G'N'R were big, but not big enough to ram a double album down the throat of Geffen without paying a huge fee. In the end, they were right and the label was wrong, as usual.The tour was great. I saw them in Mt View, Ca.

So, with a grain of salt, realize this movie is SATIRE and BLACK COMEDY with gun running as the vehicle.With that disclaimer out of my system, let me say, i really enjoyed the movie.

I can't say I know how Stevie managed to craft one of the greatest blues/pop records of a generation. Fusing blues, rock, jazz, and other influences, this is a record that will really leave your jaw agape. Like Jimi's Axis: Bold as Love, Stevie was headed out to uncharted territory for someone of his musical genre. He was one of those few muscians, in the company of Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and Frank Zappa, who recognized that it is imagination, not opportunity or the desire of your fans, that govern where your craft leads you.During the Guitar Shop/In Step tour Jeff Beck and SRV rotated as show openers for the other. At a show at the Worcester Centrum SRV was the opener and closed his set with one of the single greatest displays of blues, jazz, and fusion, playing Riviera Paradise, I have ever witnessed...and stunningly, the venue was only half full.

This album and CD were releaded at the dawn of digital recording. I first heard the vinyl of Theme of Secrets at the radio station I worked and was instantly hooked. It was on the now defunt Private Music label which saught to combine forward looking technical music with the VERY best recording technology. Theme of Secrets became one of the VERY first DDD (digital recording, master, and transfer) CDs.It has fantastic textrues created by the now arcane synclavier. This state of the art keyboard/computer, with add on modules for guitar and other instruments. Eddie and Frank Zappa were true pioneers of this machine. Sadly, the company that made them went bust.

Heath Ledger took this movie into territory that Christian Bale could not have alone. This really is a very basic comic book adaptation made into a very serious social commentary by Ledger's performance as the Joker. I found myself always waiting for the Joker and somewhat zoning out when he was not there. Katie Holmes should have been retained as her replacement was very two dimensional and just did bring her role to life. Sadly, the Joker may live on but his portray by the late Heath Ledger will not.

I had my original copy, on CD, the VERY day this was released in the fall of 1987. Some recordings bring back vivid memories of a specific time and this record is a case in point. The good news is that is has aged VERY well and the band have done a tremendous job with this re release. I always knew a day would come when all of the Bsides would come together. I can only hope they give the same treatement to ALL of the back catalog.

This album, along with a number of other records such as The Clash's London Calling, heralded the beginning of the '80s. There is not a weak track here, whether it be Stories for Boys, A Day without You or Electric Co. Besides great lyrics, they all really rock. This record really lacks the pomp and bombast that to some degree permiates the newer stuff, such as All That You Can't leave behind. These guys may have been young and naive, but even then there was a message they were determined to deliver. This is an essential edition to any comprehensive music collection.

Though surprising that they chose the Shrine show considering there are plenty of good recordings of The lamb lies down on Broadway, the remastering and overdubs make for a great show that reminds listeners, who are mostly hardcore fans, why this band was really something special and probably not appreciated fully by the masses. For me, DISCS 1 &amp; 2 are why I bought this set. DISC 3 has a lot of great live material representing the great tracks from the FOXTROT and SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND albums. DISC 4 is from the vaults and there are many treats.

Revolver finds the lads shedding their bubblegum pop capes once and for all freely embracing the sounds of Abbey Road, Bob Dylan, and India. Simply, this is an absolutely remarkable endeavor. A record that would change the face of music once and for all. No longer is pop music simply about commercialism. Now, it became a form of artistic expression free to embrace all cultures and instantly accessible to everyone. What makes this album all the more remarkable is that it did all of this in under 40 minutes!

As a 2nd generation punk &lt;sneer&gt; from the '80s, this album was a staple of what I listened to. Of course, Malcolm McLaren had the last laugh all the way to the Bank. It's ok because regardless of the motivation, this album captured the angst and anger of a generation tired of bloated rock bands and stodgy society. To think that Nirvana gets more recognition than these guys amazes me. Nirvana are a retread Pistols.

My first brush with SRV was the release of Bowie's Lets Dance and then then the radio was all a buzz with Pride and Joy. I had everyone of SRV's records on vinyl. This one, sadly, reminded me how much drugs were draining the skill and talent from this awesome player. I very much wanted it to live up to Texas Flood and Couldn't stand the Weather...it just didn't... The songs were rehashed and the playing tired. There are a few stellar tracks. I gave this 3 stars because if you are fan, you should own it. If you are casual and there were only 1 discs you were going to buy, it would be Texas Flood hands down.

There are certain recordings that become part of the audio landscape. This was one of them. If ever there was a band that defined Americana in the '80s, it was The Cars. And like so many or our aging and posthemous heroes, they passed into lore.I think the most enduring test of the greatness of this record is to play against what's spinning these days and it will still sound as fresh as the day as these Boston boys cranked it out....don't ya stop, don't ya stop!

I was lucky enough to acquire both the Vinyl edition and original UK CD release of this recording in the '80s. Timing has a lot to do with one's ability to enjoy this soundtrack because your association to the end of the cold war will influence that judgment. This is NOT a Pink Floyd recording on side 2. It is a Bleeding Heart band recording of the RADIO KAOS era. I was, and still am, a huge fan of this recording. The musicianship and performance characteristics are stellar. The production, using what was at that time state of the art, is great. Roger did have something important to say about the fear of death in a increasingly tense stand off between the USSR and NATO. If you weren't alive or cognizant of those times this recording is hard to enjoy. While opaque drug induced lyrics make bong hits all the better, this is a very political statement which lacks the subtlety of such recordings of the Pink Floyd era.

I, like many Hendrix fans, was really looking forward to this set. And if you're a really big fan, you already have the import Polygram releases of Isle of Wight, In the West, and Band of Gypsies. When you trim away the re-release material, alternate takes that sound nearly identitcal, there is maybe 2 cds worth of gems. And gems they are!!!As usual, the Hendrix family serves up the bare minimum instead of going the extra mile, which would be deal with the reissuing of albums like In the West correctly and not pawn them off, again, in a box set that had huge potential.

To call this a Travelling Wilbury's record is dead wrong. Though this may not be ELO circa New World Record, it has a very current and vital sound. It's not Jeff's fault that his signature production sound has overwhelmed the air waves with hits from Tom Petty, The Travelling Wilburys, Roy Orbison, Del Shannon, and George Harrison. I loved these records, the old ELO records, and later stuff as well. Armchair Theater is one of the most overlooked records in recent memory. Listening to Jeff spin a song is always worth the price of admission. Accept the record for what it is and not dwell in the past.

I owned the vinyl before there even were cds and I felt then, and now, that the performance is much better than the recording. Uli John roth absolutely steals the show with his blistering lead guitar riffs. He was so much better than Mathias Jabs. At this time, they were a blues based hard rock band. To me, this was their peak artistically. Tracks like Speedy's Coming, We Burn the Sky, Fly to the Rainbow, and Robot Man are blistering. And, get the import double disc with ALL tracks.

While the previous import version had several bonus tracks, this new version has had a massive sonic upgrade. Most hard rock fans probably don't realize what a huge force the Scorpions already were by the early '70s. With the twin guitar work of Uli John Roth and Rudy Schenker, they had a sound way ahead of its time. Though, the production work on the records matched the times and there was certainly a lot of his. Well, no longer. Though these recordings are far from cheap, for real fans of the Scorpions and hard rock from the '70s, take the plunge!!!!!!

I remember in an interview Gary said he gave up playing metal after releasing After the War as the material was becoming stale. Writing and playing the same thing was becoming boring. Sadly, I see the same thing happening here. It seems that his last couple of records, post Blues for Greeney, are sufferring the same fate. I've found that I can't get beyond 3 or 4 songs before I'm ready to listen to something else. I love Gary's playing and it pains me to say so. Thankfully, I can always fall back on After Hours or Corridors of Power.

This movie taught me to NOT read reviews before I watched it. One reviewer revealed that as the whole movie was nothing more than a bad dream it was ruined. Au contraire. There is plenty in this movie to force the watcher to watch again and again to answer the many nagging questions/mysteries put forth. That's what I love about this movie. Even in the end, you really are not sure what is real and what is not. The director, Martin Scorcese, is not known for this type of film. I hope he'll take another shot with this fine thriller/mystery.

Unfotunately, Stuart Adamson took his own life and this album is the last Big Country recording he gave it his all to. What is most evident is the influence of his new home, Nashville, on the sound. Instead of a blast of Scotland, we get a much more country feel, which is fine. Fragile Thing is one of the finest songs recorded by this band. This album is a fine swan song.

After the release of Dirty Work the Stones were on the verge of a breakup with the Glimmer twins not on speaking terms. As always, Keith wanted to rock and Mick wanted to wonk... listen to She's the Boss and you will get the picture. Keith put together a band very much in the Stones mold...heck, Bobby Keyes is the sax player.... release an album and hit the road, which they did for this album and Main Offender. If you love the Stones and have always had a special place in your heart for Keith's vocals... Think Happy and Little T&A.... this record is for you!!!!!

His material with Cream, Derek and the Dominos, Blind Faith, and Delaney and Bonnie was of a much higher quality. That said, the guitar playing and pop is still great to listen to. His US tour of the same year was quite memorable.Tulsa Time is classic solo Clapton.

My parents were conservative republicans in the '60s. Yet, they had a deep love for music of social conscience such as The Weavers, Peter, Paul, &amp; Mary, and Simon and Garfunkel. And so, I came to love these groups as well. And thru the music, I gained a glimpse into the '60s a little later as I was 4 in 1970.Now 30 years later these songs play to me like an old friend come for a visit. I like compilations with outtakes and unreleased live material. THis set has enough to be needed by the serious collector. The Columbia years may be more comprehensive. But, it lacks some of the rarities found here.

For Brian Johnson and the boys, this was probably their peak artistically. Regardless of how much bigger the tours got, they really hit their peak with Flick of the Switch. I've always thought of Back in Black, For those about to rock...., and Flick of the Switch as a trilogy as the formulas are almost identical, which is what really makes them enjoyable to listen to. After this, I think the closest record is their most recent, Stiff Upper Lip. Bon would be proud, and promply have another drink.

Post Bon Scott AC/DC are epitomized by their first releases, Back in Black, FTATR, and Flick of the Switch. An overlookedkey component is the drumming of Phil Rudd. He left the bandnot too long afterwards and only returned in the late '90s. Flick does just that, the power gets turned on and never stops.If I had a complaint, its that the album is relatively short clocking in at under 40 minutes. Highligts include Rising Power, Flick of the Switch, Bedlam in Belgium, and Landslide.What makes AC/DC great is Youngs fluid guitar and Rudd's driving beat. This album is not short on either.

As a collector of Zeppelin live shows, it is disappointing that the only official chronicle of one of the 3 greatest live bands of the '70s (Zep, Floyd, WHO...honorable mention to the Stones) was from the ill fated Houses of the Holy tour. Maybe Jimmy will finally do us all justice and finally release both a cd and video anthology of the vast amount of high quality live Zeppelin material. Until then, this is what we have........

I stillremember standing in line in '77 to see the first one and subsequently for the second and 3rd installments. I don't seeanyway back here. The plot is booring, the CGI completly makesthese films unremarkable, and the acting is so stale and lifeless to make you wonder, other than for money, that this film was made.

I always love reading 1 star reviews. They have NO idea how hard it was in 1979 to recreate what was done in the studio. Using tape loops were incredibly difficult as well as the multitrack instruments. The Floyd delivered the goods on this tour!!!!! As for MLOR, Pulse, the Division Bell, and Delicate Sound of Thunder... They are good in their own right but the songs you really want to here were mostly written by Roger.

Pink Floyd are so old that their newer fans have lost a sense of time and the past. This isn't a reguritated effort to rip the fans. This is a chronicle of one of rock's finest moments. Unfortunately, only a lucky few were there to see Rog, Dave, Rick and Nick show the world what rock was capable of. As a collector, I had a copy of the Nassau shows in early '83 and I was in awe. Almost 20 years later, technology and mass production has caused this recording to be a victim of inflation.Put this recording in perspective and you'll realize that show is as important as many other live giants such as Live at Leeds, Get Yer Ya-yas out, and The Song Remains the Same.

I too saw Roger this tour, as well as on the Pros and Cons and RADIO KAOS tours. I gave this 4 stars because I think that each successive tour has slid a little backwards not in material, but delivery. Though Roger, as a performer, is light years ahead of the corpse known as Pink Floyd, the In the Flesh band has lost some of the passion and edge that was in the previous incarnations of the Bleeding Heart Band. Gone are Jay Stapely, Andy Newmark, and Dooreen Chanter. Though Snowy White was a veteran of previous Waters and Floyd tours, and Thin Lizzy for that matter, his playing lacked the blues edge that made him so sought after. Still, I would NEVER miss an opportunity to see this band again.

Like so many artists of the pasts, their record labels keep crankin' out product. At least in Marley's case, they keep getting better. As a collector, I really look forward to a new release from Island/Tuff gong. The stellar production and bonus tracks are a real treat. My only wish is that a full length recording, such as Pittsburg '80, would be released.Exodus was a crowing achievement for the Wailers. Bob certainly reached the top of the Mountain.

A great album made better with the additional live and jam tracks. Hard to believe that this album is now more than 20 years old! Given that the Marley estate has not really put outmuch live material, the Exodus tour tracks are welcome to collectors of Bob's live legacy.

Not many artists had the clout, or money, to spend as much time as The Beachboy did recording Pet Sounds. Remember, it was 1966. To say this album broke new ground is an understatement. Sgt Pepper was still more than a year away and Dark Side of the moon still another 7 years. Thank you guys.

There are probably 3 records that define Rock. To me, they are this record, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, and Pet Sounds. This is true audio art. As such, it requires nothing more than the most basic sound system for its hypnotic effects to take hold.

I acquired my first copy of DSOTM in 1982 on Harvest (EMI) records. While I had the pleasure of hearing this record on a Thorens TD-126 MK II, McIntosh C-26 Preamp, McIntosh MC2015 Power Amp and Bose 901s, I really didn't come to appreciate how amazing it sounded until i had the misfortune of playing that same record on a much more inferior AIWA system I got for college. When the CD era really took over, I had the good fortune of acquiring it again on the now legendary EMI-Japan black disc. The sound was great but I still lacked the equipment to appreciate the differences between CD and Vinyl. I then acquired the EMI 20th Anniversary edition remastered domestically. Nice packaging and decent sound. I bought it again when it came out on CD/SACD a few years ago for $10. Well.... amazingly my own system has now made it to a high enough level...McIntosh... that I can appreciate the differences between vinyl and CD having bought this 30th Anniversary edition on vinyl. WOW. Everything that the likes of Neil Young have been saying about vinyl for years I can finally appreciate. Get the vinyl ... but make sure you have the equipment to enjoy it.

When I heard about these sets, I really became excited. DSOTM is one of the most important pop records ever. As such, I had very high expectations that upon receiving and enjoying this set... I realize I only got today, were not fully realized. As a serious Floyd collector... I have soundboard recordings of the band going all the way back to Piper at the Gates of Dawn, I know what the band has access to and had expected some serious contributions from those vaults for these immersion sets....Disc 1: James Guthrie remasterThis is worth doing and bringing it up to par with the vinyl remaster he did a few years ago for the 30th Anniversary. If you have any of the Japanese remasters, this probably does nothing for you. For the masses, a very worth while undertaking 4/5Disc 2: Live from Wembley 1974While a valuable edition to those without access to this sort of material, a poor choice!!!! Firstly, Pink Floyd had been playing DSOTM for 2 years by the time this recording was made AND this recording was actually made during the WISH YOU WERE HERE tour... you will notice this is the same show being used for the WISH YOU WERE HERE immersion set, which also includes rough recordings of material that will later show up on ANIMALS. Sure, by 1974 they had the technology to perform the show in the same manner as they recorded it unlike the actual tours for DSOTM. And finally, this was performed as the 2nd set of the show with the WISH YOU WERE HERE material and rough Animals material having opened the show.... 4/5 for historical value 3/5 for its inclusion and 2/5 for completeness. NOTE: combine this with WISH YOU WERE HERE immersion material and the show is still NOT COMPLETE.sadDisc 3:Various different mixes digitized for CD. For completists wanting the material in one place versus having to make various seperate purchases as this material is already available. 3/5Disc 4 and 5:DVD AND Blu Ray of various unreleased material. I really enjoyed this 4/5Disc 6:Unreleased material and mixes. While I had most of this material from various sources, this would be a very welcome edition to the collection of average folks. 3/5OTHER BONUS STUFF: 2/5While intersting the very first time you open the box, this will very quickly do nothing more than gather dust. Save the cost of production and the environment and skip this sort of thing.

Such power really hid itself below the surface and occasionally showed itself in such Beatles songs as I,me,Mine and Its all too much. Still, George was kept in check by John and Paul. And finally, they went their separate ways and George was finally free to let out and explore his creativity. And thankfully, that explosion created one of THE great records of the early '70s and in many ways is as much a Beatles record, but still a solo record, as the later Beatles record. It's rock, but still very well produced and innovative all in one stroke.

Very few '70s records are so well produced, with the exception of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. As bubblegum as many of the tracks are, it is hard to escape the catchy melodies and wonderful guitar layers that cascade one after the other. This is of course the genius of MIT grad Tom Schulz, father of such inventions as the guitar/bass rockman. I've had this album since its release in the '70s, starting with vinyl, onto to cassette, and finally CD. And everytime I put it on, I find it very difficult to not listen to the entire thing before moving on. That is probably what makes this great. The recording pulls in and doesn't let go until it's finished or you have to flip the disc, change sides of the tape. I doubt I'll ever get tired of this one.....

Maybe Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa are the only two American artists as prolific as Bruce. This set is not even close to the definitive listing of the unreleased material that Bruce has collected from all of his sessions. What we have here are the songs that Bruce has chose for us to hear. A glimpse. And what we have is pure genius at work. I can't even imagine how difficult it must be to decide what songs stay and go on one of his records. The E Street bands sound incredible on these recordings.

Was it really 20 years ago that Rolling Stone gave this album, yes album not CD, 5 stars? Easily the best produced Floyd record to date. Sure, Ezrin did a great job with the Wall and Alan Parsons should be complimented for DSOTM. Still, technology marches on and what gets delivered here is a record that is just pristine in its sound quality...On to the music.The '80s were really a VERY poor time given that the Cold War was given new, and more menacing, life by 'Maggie' Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. As Roger Waters said many times, he was under the impression that REAL lessons had been leanred from WWII.And frankly, they had not, as evidenced by the Falklands War,and so many that have come since. Southampton Dock is just so chilling.This record really was the end of the Floyd as fans came to know the band. Roger and David were not getting along and Richard Wright had already been kicked out of the band. Things were bad enough that Nick Mason didn't even play on Two Sunsets.Instead, Andy Newmark, of Roxy Fame, and soon the Bleeding Heart Band handled the work.

Paul Rodgers & Simon Kirke - Half of Free. Probably one of the greatest, and most underrated, blues bands of the early '70s. Rodgers voice is one of the most recognizable voices in all rock.Mick Ralphs - On a good day, close to Kossoff in talent. There are many live Mott the Hoople recordings to back that up. A great song writer. Can't Get enough and Movin' On were Mott the Hoople songs that Ian Hunter just didn't have the vocal range for.Boz Burrell - King Crimson. Important prog rock band. Talented bass player. Probably the least known of the four.Between the great song writing, great guitar playing, and Rodgers phenominal voice, they became a staple of AOR stations across the country. This album was their shot across the bow. Probably their best.

From the first blast of What you Need, you knew this band were dialed in to a sound that many attempted to duplicate in the '80s. Great music isn't nostalgia. 20 years later, this album sounds fresh and vibrant. I saw them on the thieves , Kick, and Suicide Blonde tours. When I think of this band in the wake of Michael's death, I only want to rember this disc, that year, and great music.....shine like it does.

I remember in '83 a buddy saying that Live Under a Blood Red sky was the greatest live album ever. The version of Sunday Bloody Sunday and Electric Co. make a strong case. Too bad Judy Collins made them edit out the Send in the Clowns bit. You can still find the original release on vinyl. This album marks the cross over from regular pop band to a band of conscience and vision. As such, I expect this album to be remembered for quite some time.

Steve gave us the sound of U2 and Big Country (RIP Stuart Adamson). That guitar sound we love is a combo of Edge's chords and Lillywhite production. This album, along with Boy and October, were a trilogy of angry anthems from a band on the verge of superstardom. Now 20 years has passed and Sunday Bloody Sunday is still just as powerful. The whole world has changed. So has the sound of U2. This was the end of their first phase....don't forget.

Was it really 19 years ago that this album thundered across the airwaves? Yeah, it was. As great as the original cd was ( I have it ), the remaster is made that much better with the edition of 4 terrific tracks from that period. I'm really amazed that they were not album tracks as Heart and Soul, Angle Park, and The Crossing were staples of the early shows. All that is missing is Balcony. We all know it was Stuart's guitar playing that made this music jump out of the radio. But, I think the lyrics are just as good if not better. These lyrics would be great over the top of almost any music.Stuart has left us now, but the echoes of this cd and so many memories for the fans will sustain their place in rock history, I hope. Though they will probably never be a Hall of Fame band, they joing other great bands with similar legacies such as Mott the Hoople, Free, ELO, and Thin Lizzy.

The '80s should be remembered for more than big hair and synthesizers. It should be remembered for Big Country and their Scottish blended rock'n'roll! At at time when rock was saying little, this band dared to make us think about the common folk. Belting out one anthem after another they took the world by storm with this record and many to come after.

Cream died a horrible death of egos. It's easy to see why this group followed similarly. Ginger, as great as he is, should not have been allowed to join this group, or Winwood and Clapton would have kept going. I think it's great that we get to hear the jams, as well as classics (Presence of the Lord and Can't find My Way Home), on this set. If you're a Clapton or Winwood fan, this double disc needs to find a home in your collection. Still, not quite essential.

Some movies try to say to much. Some movies spend too much time blowing stuff up and showing people killed in excruciating detail. The Hong Kong style of film making, at times, tries to bridge that gap. Joe, portrayed by Nicholas Cage, is a killer aware that time in his trade is growing short and its time for one big score and get out intact. As in the real world, life takes mysterious turns. This is not a happy film. It is dark, moody and brooding. I recommend you watch this film entirely and then make a judgement.

After reading Kurt Loder's RS review, I was really pumped for this album. I guess when you consider that 99% of the new releases these day are complete garbage, this does stand out. Though, this release does not compare on the same level as Born In the USA, Darkenss at the Edge of Town, or The River. I really wanted to make this album a steady listen, but it's not going to happen. I'm not a huge enough fan to think at every note is pure genius. I sincerely hope there will be a true BS & The E-Street Band released in the future.

Some albums capture important moments in rock history and others are just there. This is an absolute classic and proves that metal was not just a phase, but an important musical presence. And of course, it was the instrumental genius of Rhandy and energy of Ozzy that really drives this recording. Ozzy has had many highs, both on and off the stage, but he peaked here. yeah, Jake E. Lee and Zak Wylde are good, but Rhandy was unbelievable. Night after night he delivered the goods. I'm bummed as I was supposed to see the Band on the Diary of a Madman tour in Maine, but Rhandy's death put a kabosh to that.My only wish is that Ozzy will release more recordings from this tour as their are some real gems, such as the shows in Indy and Montreal.

Clint Eastwood needs to be credited for making 2 very important Westerns, especially the first, in The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Unforgiven. Though famous for the spaghetti westerns, filmed in Spain, made by the likes of Dino Delorentis, when Clint turned his own eye to the genre he chose to not only be serious, but to remind us that life in that era was far from glamerous. With that in mind, he took a crack at remaking Shane. Sure, there are some significant differents. Still, the stranger rescuing innocents is right out Shane. I still found this story to be a little TOO cookie cutter. When I first saw Shane, I really wasn't sure our hero was going to win the big duel. In this case, there was no doubt. I recommend this film with the proviso that you don't expect too much.

We've spent 10 years in the shadow of pseudo rock, called grunge/alternative. Finally, some serious heavyweights in the form of Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine (minus Zack) have grabbed the torch.There sound is best captured in tracks such as Set it Off, Gasoline, and Cochise. These are bone crunching tracks with soaring vocals and wailing guitars.

College radio was *MADE* by records like this one. The '80s were a time of musical excess which bludgenoed us with hairmetal bands. No worries, I liked many of them but could seeit was a formula, like any other, that was rapidly loosingmomentum. Even the indie scene, the life blood of collegeradio, was somewhat tired. And then, bang, this gem appearedand blew us all away. There was no Pearl Jam, Nirvana, andSoundgarden. Instead, we had Sonic Youth and, now, Jesus andMary Chain. This album is phil spector's wall of sound meetsScottish punk meets the beach boys. Within their wall of noiseare truly breathless melodies and haunting lyrics. If youare serious about your music then this needs to be the one Jesusand Mary Chain record you purchase. I'm pushing 40 now and still this record means as much as it did to me going on 20years after its release. As a sign of the times, this was oneof the first CDs I purchased on the new format known as CompactDisc. Buzz on.

I was a college radio jock when the Reid boys sprung this on us. This album is a combo of Phil Spector/Beach Boys Pet Sounds wall of sound meets punk lyrics. The result is a catchy record full of driving beats and wondeful melodies with lots of adrenaline. Now almost 20 years later it is still one of the best records of that period and still sounds just as innovative as the day it was released. I don't know if the band has ever matched the impact of this record with their next releases. Why the were never copied more or cited as a real influence is beyond me.

Flea and the boys really started something special in the mid tolate '80s. And up until Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their music really was something to watch as a mix of so many styles. ByThe Way is not a record following that trend. It is a qualitypop record, and certainly better than 99.9 percent of the musicbeing recycled by most artists. They set the bar so high thatit's difficult to return to that level.

TO you young folks that means they used the cheapest vinyl, removed all the extra art work, and did the bare minimum to keep it on the shelves while still charging full price...$8.98....This new CD version is really something.All of the original tracks are there plus a whole bunch of more from the vaults...

Having been introduced to Jarre in 1986 with the release of Zoolook, I was instantly intrigued and then began working my way back thru his catalog. Time and technology have somewhat left this souvenir of this momentus tour behind. Live Recordings Hong Kong, Docklands, and Houston/Lyon feel more alive than this very sterile yet purposeful recording. Maybe it was the Chinese audiences with there sedate yet respectful applause. I owned this recording on vinyl, which I still treasure today. I still consider this live recording a must for any serious Jarre fan. Sad that these were split into vol. 1 and 2... obvious money grubbing.

I remember clear as a bell, like the one in Franklin's tower, a buddy lending me a bootleg, before the official release, and making me promise to listen to it. As a staunch non dead fan, I knew I'd listen to 5 minutes turn it off and return to listening to another band. Wrong! I listened, turned on, and never looked back....and many shows later!This was a land mark show and one of the most bootlegged. It was one of the great Wall of Sound shows and a must for any diverse collection.

Strange that one of the VERY first digital records should get remastered. Dire Straits were very much a band of the early '80s with their definitive blues rock sounds with records Dire Straits, Lover Over gold, Communique, and Making Movies. With a single stroke, things would never be the same with a record that became synonimous with the changing face of music i.e. the advent of music videos as a medium to sell, promote, and entertain. Honestly, I find this record to almost be from a different band as the music is that dramatically different. Only Walk of life, and maybe Money for Nothing, have sounds that are vaguely familiar. Ride Across the River, So Far Away, and One World are songs from a band headed in a new direction and so was the music industry.....

This was the followup to Guitar Shop and was simply Jeff's dedication to one of his strongest musical influences. Too much gets made about the playing not reflecting the talent of the MAN. This style is not about how many notes you can bend, but simply letting it fly. The Bigtown playboys really help carry this off well. I don't necessarily put this on all that often, but when I want this style, I reach for it along with Rockpile.

Depending on your age, there are certain records that were always being played around you. For me, along with Simon and Garfunkel AND The Weavers, this was a staple. Sure, it was my Mom's music but as i grew older it became mine. The interplay of songwriting and musicianship between Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, David Crosby, and Neil Young is stellar in every way. Who would ever imagine men from such bands as The Hollies, Byrds, and Buffalo Springfield getting together and crafting a record that conistently stands the test of time. I am sure my son will know this record.

I was more influenced by his books then TV appearances on Cosmos, which was a great show. The book really made me smile and reminded me of what was great about the scientist and the man. As we all are, he was mortal and flawed and this book did not try to hide either. It's possible Sagan's final note to us all was his article at the end of the now defunct George magazine. In it, he looked foreward and encouraged us all to take better care of our planet and fellow inhabitants.

This album is proof that money, success, and easy living can completly kill the Godfathers of thrash metal. This album is barely even metal. AS good as many of the songs are, and the material is still better than 90% of the bands out there, the speed with which they move shows that Metallica have completely lost the edge that took them to the top. I'm reminded of Apollo Creed saying to Rocky that 'Its the eye of the tiger.' I listen to this record a lot, because its a very good rock record, just not the thrash that makes Kill'em All, Ride the Lightning, and Master of Puppets absolute must records for metal lovers.

This record was recorded in the midst of SRV's resurgence. The In Step tour with Jeff Beck had just ended and Jimmy, fresh out of rehab, was in need of a project to resurrect his career. With a mix of songs written both individually and collaboratively, Family Style was the end product. This was neither the hard blues from Double Trouble or guitar pop of the T-birds. We find ourselves in the middle. I recommend this record not so much for the music but as a souvenir of the love of two brothers and their talent.

The reviewer who said that SRV was not on this set obviously did not read the liner notes, which indicate that SRV played on the Lonnie Mack tracks from the Strikes Like Lightening sessions. The other artists the reviewer stated that were not there ARE, but are not the featured artist on the tracks.I bought this set, and the 25th, when they came out and was really wowed by what I heard. Houndog Taylor is my favorite, followed closely by Koko Taylor and Albert &quot;Master of the Telecaster&quot; Collins. There is some really fine musicianship, great feel, and real respect for the blues displayed on this set.Higly recommended.

The band really seems quite stiff. I expected more life. I was one of the folks left with Zoom tickets as memorbelia. The real way to do give this AWESOME music some life is to do what I did. Transfer the audio, which is VERY good to CDR and when listening dream up your own visuals.

Yeah, I'm one of those unlucky soul's holding onto tickets for the ill fated Zoom tour. This recording goes along way to heal the wound. The song selection is great. Though, I wish there had been a couple of tracks from Balance of Power. And, the production is so polished that it's hard to tell that this is a live recording.

This upbeat fusion of Ehtiopia world beat and Hip-hop leaves you breathless from the outset and never lets go. The opening track Bole to Harlem sets a wonderful danceable tone. One of the biggest complaints about hip hop are the repetitive and redundant themes. Its hard to not enjoy the blended rhythms of hip hop combined with bole. THis is a cd you will play and before you know it, its all you want to listen to.

I define a great record by the sound, regardless of the style. The rock beats are solid, the musicianship good, and the lyrics are lightweight. This combination is perfect.

For many years, there has been insufficient live material from one of the more important and innovative bands of the early '70s. The EU label Angel Air has been doing their best to correct this. As noted in the official review, this is from the archives of band members. With a few exceptions, it is a fantastic chronicle of one of the great live acts of the '70s. If you love Free, Bad Company, and David Bowie, this recordings will be a welcome addition to your collection.

These guys do a great job of accepting the torch from the old school master Bunny Wailer, Burning Spear, and The Wailers. Between the use of synth, catch rhythms, and world conscious lyrics, this is a band extremly worthy of recognition. Many highs were awaiting this band down the road. This was the album that put them on the map along with Black Uhuru, Inner Circle, and Yellowman. Grab Education and Rollerskates are excellent examples of the 'new' sound.

Some movies are fortunate to contain moments of premonition...this is one of them...there is a moment when Joe is talking about the Mescaleros andtheir commercial woes....He says, if this record doesn't break even,there won't be another...we have at least a couple more in us. How would know that Global did not break even and it was his death that guaranteed the next record? Joe was a working class and prophet and this movie proves it.

I can see how some find the sound to be not as crips, unless it were vinyl, that some folks would like. Heck, these recordings are OLD and remastering too much strips the life away.Discs 3 and 4 make this set for me. I always hated that their live material was spread out across Goodbye, Wheels of Fire, and the Live Cream volumes. Now it's all here together as it should have been from the beginning. To me, the studio material was time passing between gigs.

Was it only yesterday that Kurt Loder announced on MTV news that Ginger Baker was added to the lineup.....and then I never gave it another thought. And then one day, a buddy running a record store got this cd in a bunch of discs to be sold as used. He instantly included it in a package of other stuff and sent it off to me. Upon my first listen, I became not only hooked, but convinced that this was one THE greater recordings out of the '90s. Very seldom does a a great band get reincarnated. For a fleeting moment, Cream was alive and well. Ginger (God, I love that name!) is drummin as well as ever (take a listen to BBM's Around the Next Dream for continued proof).

to quote bono, 'there's been alot of talk, way too much talk'. Instead of reinventing themselves, U2 have returned with a thematically upbeat record, which is a far cry from Achtung Baby, the darkest U2 record to date. Maybe not as great as Boy and October, but certainly better than the Unforgettable Fire and Rattle and Hum.

This cd just keeps growing on me. I count my allegiance to this band all the way back to War, when I fist heard Sunday Bloody Sunday. My fav is Boy. This band has had 3 very distinct phases. The Lillywhite sound (Boy, October, War, Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum). The Grunge/Alternative sound with Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop. And now, they've redefined their sound with an extremly compelling, and positive, release. With all that has happend in the last year and half, I'm so glad to hear Bono sing about hope, rememberance, and moving forward with our lives without dwelling too much in the past. Kite and become my new anthem.

I really like the '80s ELO. There is no comparison between the '70s and '80s material. And, why bother to do so. What we get hear is a sound that combines great pop with stellar production. And if you listen closely, you hear a sound that went on to propel Tom Petty (Full Moon Fever and Into The Great Wide Open) and George Harrison (Cloud Nine) to the top of the charts. In the '80s, computers should replace the strings. Technology marches on.

After a friend demanded that I buy only one Hendrix album (this was a while ago before cds), Are You Experienced, another friend told me that Band of Gypsies was Hendrix at his peak live. I bought the record and was convinced. Years later, I tracked down the cd, which was an import, that has 3 songs that never appeared on any domestic vinyl or cd release of the single disc edition. To this day, one of those 3 bonus tracks has ever been offically released in the US. As a owner of all 4 shows from the Filmore EAst, I can tell you that it's a shame and a crime to watch material trickle out and premium dollar. Yeah, this set rocks. But what waits in the vaults would really amaze.

It is so hard to believe that this was a late '70s record. Unlike a lot of the overblown rock by bands like the Stones, The Who, and Zeppelin, here was a band that was extremly tight and could flat out play. Now 25 years later this album is still timeless in its flawlessnes. My Favorite tracks are Lions and Wild West End. You can see why Mark was already playing on Bob Dylan's late '70s records and would later appear on Infidels in '83. I've always thought of Mark Knopfler as a guitar slinging Bob Dylan and this record shows why. Great imagery firmly routed in the Blues with superior muscianship.

Now so many years after Bob's death, left this album lays downs rhythms that are still unequalled. Unlike many overrated artists, there is something really magical about The Wailers final album. Tracks like Could you Be Loved and Work really get the body moving. This can be attributed to the Barrett brothers who really hold this band together behind Bob's empassioned vocals. This album picks up where Survival and Rastaman Vibration left off. If there was an album that a tour album should have captured, it was this one instead of Babylon By Bus, which captured the Rastaman Vibration tour

If ever there were a vibe of freedom, it comes from Souad Massi! Amazing how effortlessly this very talented artist blends calypso, flamenco, and traditional Algerian phrasing. I must say that the production really needs a hand as well. SO often great music does not get the production effort really needed to bring the sound to life. While this is a CD, and not vinyl, the vibrancy is certainly there in spades. Get this CD!!!!! Once your fingers hit play, there is no going back.

Metal may have changed a lot over the last 30 years, but thereis no doubt who are one one of the rulers. This double CD setreally captures Sabbath at their artistic peak. The riffs maynot be as bone crunching as that of later Sabbath releases ofthe '80s when Metal really picked up speed and virtuoscity, butyou can really get a sense for where this was all going to lead.Toni really sounds great. The real surprise has to be Ozzy. His voice had so many less miles on it that it leaves you wondering "Is that really Ozzy?", and of course it is!!!

There is some really stellar guitar riffs over the top of the somewhat repetitive tape loops. This has been Jeff's main modus since the release of Flash some 20 years ago.

At this time, I owned Speaking in Tongues and Stop Making Sense. The first track I listened to was Building on Fire and after that, there was NO turning back....

Like many, I was captivated by Gorky Park, which I read on it's first edition all those years ago. I waited for anxiously, and enjoyed, Polar Star. I thought Polar Star was a good read, but had along way to go to equal Gorky Park. Red Square did as good a job of capturing the chaos that is post Communist Russia as I thought possible. A truly stellar work. I bought this in hard cover thinking it would be an equal. It isn't. Renko is a much a derelict as Cuba itself. The story I thought drifted without the drive that made the others great/good. Still, this is a character that I enjoy and look forward to Martin Cruz Smith taking another trip with.

The importance of the Weavers as voices of conscience and social justice can not be underestimated. Old School folk artists, such as Woody Guthrie and The Weavers, were the nations conscience at a time when being a dissenter made you an enemy of the state.

I should avoid reading other people's reviews before writing my own. I tend to read the worst of what people have to say and often find myself wondering how they could see what they do... most often because they have a vision they think should define what the movie says and does or get caught up in what is possible in OUR world instead of the world the film maker has created.... I really liked this movie. Instead of a simple premise, predictable dialogue, and a happy ending, we are given all the drama of 8 people trying to stay sane on a long journey coinciding with a suicide mission with a noble goal driving them along. How many films kill the captain, have one of the crew kill himself, and other calamities? Not many. Yes, the earth gets its sun, but our cast are all gone with yet so many mysteries of the universe still to be unravelled.

I remember when this came out on vinyl. Yeah VINYL! At the time, not yet a Boss fan, I was struck by the sheer audacity to release a 5 album set of material. Sales were astronomical. What I didn't realize was that the set was equivalvent to the average length of a Sprinsteen show. I came to this realization while seeing bruce on his first solo tour for Lucky Town. In looking back, I know that this was a monumental statement as it set a trend for artists to release large amounts of material now known as the Box Set. Thank you Bruce.

I must admit I always felt this movie was very much like Jim Jaramsch films. Soundtracks are seldom perfect because we all hear things we hope get captured when we listen to the music alone to refresh our memories and recapture vignettes. This soundtrack is very good because it did refresh memories but what makes it better is that the music stands alone quite well. It contains mood music.... Roger Manning, Jr (ex-Jellyfish) contributes some wonderful soundscapes.... It contains '80s acid pop.... Jesus and Marychain's 'Just like 'Honey' and more current alternative sounds of My Bloody Valentine.... You could find yourself hooked.

If only Eric Clapton could match the intensity and virtuoscity he attained with Cream now! As a fan of both live volumes, there is little difference in the playing and audio quality. For years, arguments have raged about the goings on during Cream's final US tour. Specifically, the playing was lackluster as the band flamed out. After all, Steve Windwood was brought in (Blind Faith) to instill new life. Jack Bruce would have none of it and so that was the end of Cream. THis was still a band that on an off night was still redefining the sound of guitar rock along with Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and the Who, and shortly Led Zeppelin. But that is not surprising when you consider that Page, Clapton, and Beck all came from the same band(The Yardbirds).

I took a star away because of the shoddy editing of booklet, which highlights that CBS still views Dylan as mere 'product.'How they managed to list Mick Ronson, formerly of Bowie's Spiders From Mars band and Mott the Hoople, as Mike Ronson really left me scratching my head.Though the band really sounds dated, Dylan's voice sounds great and it is AWESOME to hear the Desire era material live, such as Sara, Hurricante, Isis, One more Cup of Coffee, and Romance in Durango. The rendition of The Lonesome Death of hattie Carroll is a true American folk classic.

For many years, the Rolling Thunder Review was a legend that music fans remember but did not have much to remember with. That has now changed. The recordings are surprisingly crips and probably owe to today's technology than anything else. What makes this a MUST is not only the great playing, but a diverse set list that includes songs from, arguably, Dylan's finest album, Desire. Though there is no JOEY, we get Hurricane, Oh Sister, Sara, Isis, Romance in Durango, and One More Cup of Coffee. As good as the NET shows are, this really captured Bob at the peakin of his performing prowess.

A friend turned me onto this and from that day I was hooked!!! The '70s were really the birth of modern reggae, which came out of R&B, Rock Steady, and Ska. Coming out of the same neighborhodd in Kingston as Marley and Macin(Tosh), Winston Rodney, The Burning Spear, had the same class sensiblities and realization of the power of Rastafarianism and the struggles of the downtrodden in Jamaica and elsewhere. The sounds has really changed over the years and this is where it started. A must have for any real reggae fan. Slavery days says it all....

I thought that Boys and Girls was one of the finest records ofthe '80s with Bette Noire and Mamounia as good followups. I wasreally expecting this to be a return to the stellar production and groove oriented material. Instead, it's a cross between As Time Goes By (lots of covers and some originals) and something else. I really like the album as it is extremly well producedand has the sonic layering that has become a trademark of Ferry's records and the later Roxy recordings. The covers are far more contemporary. Still, I was hoping for an album of greater engery and intensity.

Some music returns to you in the most unusual ways. I first heard the Pogues in college in 1985 and played this record, yes record, on my radio show 91.3 FM WKNH. While grieving for the loss of my closest friend from those days, I began a journey of reminiscing of those days, which included listening to bands....The Pogues, Jesus and Mary Chain, Jellyfish, The Posies, Thin Lizzy, Mott the Hoople, and The Clash.... we so often listened to and talked about with such passion. So, now, Dirty Old Town is playing and Shane's tales of death, drink, and dispairare as poignant as ever. Great music is great in any era. Its evident that these songs came from a man struggling, partying, living, and dying in the moment. Great artists are like that. They feel something visceral and are able to capture it in some form. BUY THIS MUSIC.

The Guv'nor has been rocking our world for 35 years and this set does a good job of chronicling his work. Disc 1 centers on the Yardbirds. Yes, the guitar playing is not god like. But, name me a guitar player pre '67 who was and I'd say you were mistaken.The Yardbirds were the original SUPERGROUP spawning the careers of Beck, Clapton, and Page. If you're buying this set, this is probably old news. Disc 2 is focused on Beck's 70s output. With Samplings from Truth, Rough &amp; Ready, Beck, and Bogart &amp; Appice, we hear Jeff playing some pretty good rock. The guitar playing is great while some of the material is some what marginal. Disc 3 captures the peak with There and Back, Wired, and Blow By Blow. And to boot, we get material from the underrated Flash (sorry, I love this one) and classic Guitar Shop. There are some singles as well. Yes, there could have been alot more b-sides, live material, and other goodies. This is what happens when you have an artist who leaves the details to the label and would rather be working on cars.

When I bought this set the remastered original individual discs were not available. THough, it was surprising that it took another 3 disc box to complete the remastered material. How Atlantic could release the original discs so horribly, when you consider how strong Zep sales have always been, is amazing. I guess its a testament to greed. Anyways, its an amazing set remastered by one of the high priests himself. Thank you Jimmy.....To the loser that said that this band had no innovation, were poor musicians, and overrated. I say "get history in the right order!!!" All the bands these days sound like Zep, not the other way around!!!! It's easy to copy a band, not come up with the music in the first place.

Recorded several months before Stevie collapsed in a drug and alcohol induced stuper. Frankly, I still recommend this album because there are several tracks, such as Wilie the Wimp that flat out rock. Everything you have read about overdubs etc are true. Still, this recording is still historically important.

I'm glad that Jordan is not hear to see how the gov't of the people, for the people, by the people has been so completely perverted by special interests and neo patriots, such as George W. Bush and John Ashcroft. I was only a boy, when like many, I was captivated by this incredible person. She gave me hope that govt could actually serve the people. This book does a great job to capture her spirit and remind us that govt was once a tool and not force for opression.

After what most consider a disasterous outing, Flash, Jeff really came roaring back with this one fully decked out with long time contributer Tony Hymas on keyboards and ex-Frank Zappa/Missing Persons drummer Terri Bozzio. I found that if I put this on, I had to listen to the rest until it ended. There is a real continuity and flow that makes each song blend so well together. The production is good and the musicianship is top notch. This would be among my 5 mandatory JB releases, which also includes Blow by Blow, Wired, There and Back, and Truth.

Like so many fans, I was was weened on Dark Side, Wish You wereHere, Animals, and The Wall. Water's depature seemed like theend. One ugly law suit, the boys were back in business andMomentary Lapse of Reason was released. I gobbled that up alongwith a ticket to see them in Hartford in the fall of '88.The show, though it did not compare to having just seen RogerWaters on the Radio KAOS tour, was still enjoyable.Sadly, this album poorly captures the energy of that reunionleaving the listener feeling even further from the band thenimaginable, which is amusing considering this problem is oneof the VERY themes of The Wall. If live post waters is whatyou seek, I strongly reccomend PULSE.

The Kings brand of rock has always been a simple a formula. A few guitar chords and a driving beat behind some of the best working class lyrics in popular music. I remember when this came out and having seen them on the tour. They blew me away and for years were the best live act I'd seen.The album is worth the price for the song Cliches of the World(B Movie), a dreary tale of the mundane life we sometimes lead.It does sound a bit dated, but was not like a lot of the musicthat came out of the '80s.

My appreciation of the band started with Peter Gabriel long gone from the band. I still think they were much better with him in the band. The drama and musicianship was far more important than hit songs and world tours. Genesis, with this cd, are the better parts of King Crimson (In the Court of the Crimson King) and Jethro Tull (Aqualung) in one band. It's too bad that both Genesis and Peter Gabriel were no longer as great artistically after they parted company. Cinema, Firth of Fifth, and Dancing with the Moonlit Knight are incredibly striking pieces of musical drama.

I bought this for a friend when it came out, made a copy of it on DAT, and promptly forgot about it my collection. Now 8 years later I'm listening to it and am really impressed. I thought Robert's first two records were very solid and was less impressed with such releases as Now and Zen. I think this album comes close to letting us know how much of an influence he had on the Zep sound or vice versa. If I had a compliant, I think it's a tad over produced.

I must confess my sin of having entered college from a small New England town where my music diet was classic rock, classic rock, and more classic rock. Did I mention we listend to classic rock? Things started to change when I became a fan of Big Country, which I am to this day.... The Queen is Dead was dropped in my lap the first week I arrived at KSC and there was no turning back from alternative/indy music. Marr's guitars, Morrisey vocals, and the rest of the band had a groove, a voice, and general sound that is still being copied today. There is not a single Smiths record NOT worth owning. Go for it!!!!!!

First, you must let go off the fact that you are shelling out BUCKS for music recorded roughly 35 years ago...once you do that the journey is like a trip to heaven.Basic Tracks:All the classics are here...Mover, The Hunter, All Right Now, and Be My friend. I am very impressed by the remastering effort. Free were a great band but poor production can really kill enthusiasm. Exile on Main St is a great example of an amazing record almost lost in the muddle of poor production. These songs make Koss, Simon, and Paul JUST jump out at you!!!! After years of listening to the hiss laden lps and cassettes, these songs were now a revelation.B-sidesI think we have all forgotten the true nature and purpose of the 45. It delivered a hit and often an equally good but overlooked song. Thankfully for FREE, and fans, they did quite a few singles which resulted in a large number of B-sides. I love them and real fans should too. They are every bit as good as the A-sides once again showing the amazing musical talents of Simon, Andy, and Paul.Alternate takes.This can be a thorny issue. OFten bands fill collections of altenrate takes as a means to fill space and jack up the price. Sometimes we get glimpses of how songs evolve and entirely different interpretations prior to song's actual release. I believe all of the above happens. We get different arrangements, interpretations, and some filler. That is entirely OK by me.Live SongsUnbelievable!!!!! The live material on this disc reminds us all that this band was amazing and was well ahead of its rivals.

I was just a young boy when I saw this. I was into playing 'war' with the boys in my neighborhood. I thought it was cool. After seeing this movie, and subsequantly reading Erick Maria Remarque's book, I realized there is no glorious death in war. There is only death. The acting may be stiff, but the message is increasinly chilling. I only wish our leaders could understand....

Going thru the liner notes and you realize that you have one of SRVs final contributions before his death along with many other big names in the recording industry. Though I find many of these songs forgetable, even if it was meant as a children's album, I find it worth a regular listen just to hear the many great musicians who participated.

Often with artists that pass before their time should have been up, there is a rush to make a few bucks while their memory is fresh in our minds. Some efforts are better than others. This CD collects extra tracks and few rarities from the vault and serves them up as a farewell. I think that his record label can indeed be faulted for rushing this out because as good as these tracks are, there was a great deal of material to select from that was ignored.

The mid '80s were an interesting time for pop music. Some bands let keyboards drive them (Eurythmics) and some bands let their guitars do the talking (Big Country). During this same period, prog rock experienced something of a revival. And Gabriel era Genesis inspired Marillion led the way. With musicians par excellence (Steve Rothery - guitar, Pete Treavus - bass, Ian Mosely - drums, and Fish - vocals) they really took off, at least in England. In america, the best they could muster was an opening slot for Rush on the Power windows tour.Fugazi is the middle album of a trilogy and represents the first record by the classic lineup with Mosely having replaced Mick Pointer on drums. An album of politics, blaring guitars, and heavy keyboard interludes, this album grabs you by the shirt. Where Script was uneven and Childhood bombastic, this album was much more succinct. That said, Script and Childhood are also musts, but this one is my favorite....The song Incubus is CLASSIC

I must agree that listening to many of these cuts can be quite grating when listened to on CD because CDs strip most of the life out of music let alone music from 40 years ago... BUT, get this on vinyl and it is time to strap in for an audio journey spanning Neil's early, and arguably, finest period of songwriting....Remember in Neil's first decade he'd been in Buffalo Springfield, CSN&Y, and solo artist. Most would consider anyone of those a career, but not Neil! This collection really is a journey into a decade of revolution, change, and excess. I give credit to the production work done for all of these recordings because it is evident that serious resources were devoted to them. You can't remaster trash and have it come out smelling like a rose. The drums are full, guitars, crisp, and vocals are full bodied as if Neil were in the next room. This is a MUST for any vinyl collection.

I believed this movie. The lack of redemption by any of the characters is true to life in most cases. We make decisions and are bound by them. And when we do this for long enough, there is no other path to take. The 'Ram' said it best when faced with death... I only matter in the ring. We all only matter when we are doing what feel destined to do. Mickey Rourke is back and I hope we'll see more of his style of gritty acting.

I am someone who actually worked on this book when it was published years ago. When I read the manuscript in preparation for publication, I was thrilled. Unlike the Zionist critics, or those afraid to see the world as it is, I was not afraid of the damning analysis of my country and of my ethnic breatheren. Though I may be a Jew, I do not not hold with Zionism and its hatreds. I love this book. We should be thankful that Chomsky stands where does, shoots for the truth, and challenges us to lay down our biases while on the joureny to enlightenment.

Is this box set perfect? No. Is there material missing? Sure! Is this box set worth every penny? I think so. As a serious SRV collector I've always been interested more in SRV as a performer and less about his studio work. The blues were always meant to be played live. Blues songs are vignettes to emotions and experiences. As a previous reviewer noted, most of the un released material is live, which for me, is truly worth every penny. The same reviewer noted that SRV seldom played the songs differently. As a person who saw him several times spanning his entire career with Double trouble, I could NOT disagree more. yes, the song lyrics didn't vary. The pace of songs varied almost every show. Take the song Love Struck Baby or Rude Mood. If you listen, i mean really listen, count the notes.... with SRV, it was always about the notes.

For me, Marillion are defined by roughly 5 anthematic songs (Forgotten Songs, Fugazi, Script for a Jester's Tear, Assassing, and Incubus..an honorable mention to Blind Curve and White Feather). This album is their peak. It lacks the bombast of Misplaced Childhood and has greater refinement than Script for a Jester's tear. And in my opinion, Ian Mosely is a much better drummer than Mick 'Petey' Pointer. Mosely really makes this record.

To watch television when I was young required that I go downstairs and watch on a small black and white set....Yes. Black and white. I always liked PBS and discovered this series one day. I only saw a couple of episodes when the show was on and it took until the present to see the entire series. EVERYTHING about this series is outstanding...the acting, the sets, props, etc are entirely authentic.I am far to young to have ever known what living thru the Blitz was like. To those brave lads who risked life and limb to save the lives of London's civilian population we will always be grateful

Overcharging and under delivery are the hallmark of the Hendrix estate and their release of Jimi's material. Sadly, EPIC is doing the same with SRV. You can bet we'll be getting SRV stuff for decades to come. For christ sake, if you're going to release a show, release the whole damn thing!!!! SRV was a brilliant performer and these shows prove it. It's sad that EPIC can't live up to the high standards that the performer exhibited.

Russel Crow and Christian Bale in the same film tells us there will be action...hidden meaning...and tragedy. This film delivers on all 3. Westerns are getting more realistic, which is good. The Old West was dirty, brutish, and often cruel.Ben Wade, the career criminal who, with a different set of circumstances, could have been a captain of industry/King of the World. He's a hero we don't want to see as a hero because he's on the wrong side of the law.His antagonist is a civil war vet turned family man rancher trying to raise 2 boys. Honor does not mean being the toughest man on the block.Great to see Peter Fonda coaxed out of self exile to deliver a spirted supporting role

My girlfriend and i, over the past 6 months, acquired and watched ALL 9 seasons and both Xfiles movies.... The first movie was amazing. This movie, I am sad to say, proved that not even David Duchovny could perform a rescue. During the final 2 seasons, whenever it would get boring, he would pop up and completly reinvigorate my love of this show. What were they thinking? I don't need aliens or conpiracies to rate this show highly. I must be made to think outside of my normal thinking and I will follow. This show was weird, predictable, and played off of the desires of viewers to go where ever Mulder/Scully went without thinking. Sadly, I bought this on blu ray. It looked great, and that is my only compliment.

So many of the other reviews have consistantly stated this is a set with way more potential than in reality. Of course these high expectations come from two places. firstly, the first volume was spectacular. Secondly, prog rock fans want the earth, moon, and sun from their fav bands, with me falling into the latter. What I thought most lacking was not the voluminous number of B-sides, and I'll even pass on criticizing the sound quality of some of the live recordings, was the overall smaller number of live tracks. What made this band huge, and a cut above the rest, were their shows. The first volume was a true showcase. The Genesis record produced by Hugh Padgham was probably one of the finest pop records of the 80s. Sorry, I really needed my Home by the Sea/Second Home by the Sea fix and this set didn't get me there. I'll listen with pleasure, but will always be wondering at what could have been.....

The gold has a number of bonus tracks from the session and the remastering has really cleaned up the recording. One such bonus track is a studio conversation of the Wolf teachin Clapton the chords to Little Red Rooster. classic! The story goes that in the middle of the night Bill Wyman got a phone call and was asked if he wanted to jam with the Wolf. He showed up in a red hot minute. And what a night, and a testament to the brilliance of the Wolf, he got darn close to getting the best of British rock with Clapton, Wyman, Watts, Winwood, and bunch of others.

Of course, its the voice! This set does a tremendous job of showcasing a set of pipes that probably will never be heard the like of again. MCA thru the 80s had a reputation of really doing a horrid job of releasing back catalogs. They had a graveyard reputation. All of the sudden that changed and this set is a case in point. Besides the incredible amount of archival material, the remastering of these recordings ARE STELLAR! Also, the booklet is amazing. I am sure the casual fan would find this set TOO much. For her real fans, this is a fitting tribute to roots American music. THis set cements her in our collective memories. TOO bad this set has NOW gone out of print.

I don't know how I came to see this film on HBO late one night in 1978 or '79, but I did and was hooked. Besides the story, what I was struck by was the music. At the time, there really wasn't alot of music like it. Other artists such as Jarre, Vangelis, and Eddie Jobson were still unknown for their own styles. Anyways, it has taken me nearly 20 years to finally buy this disc. I'm glad to have it as the music is still as unique as it was then.

I was a little hesitant to watch this based on comparisons made to Michael Mann's classic film Noir, heat. I am happy to report the only similarity is a bank heist gone wrong. Beyond that, the main characters could not be more disimilar, which is a good thing. A well acted struggle to escape a scripted life... Everyone in this film, even the police, know they are losers with no other choices. Whether it was Bonnie and Clyde, Heat, or The Professional, we get used bloodshed being the only end...

If you are looking for a film with characters you can empathize with, moral redemption, and a happy ending, this film will leave you unfulfilled. I must admit that this film caused a serious argument between myself and my SO within a half hour of watching it.This film is a social commentary about relationships, how people deal with unhappiness, and the constant search for answers in situations where there are NO answers to be found.Its easy to be seduced by the beautiful scenery, wit, and gag comedy that pops up thru out. In the midst of this I found myself becoming increasingly unhappy by the choices made by ALL of the women in this film who found convenient reasons to lie, cheat, and deceive. First they deceive themselves and then everyone else around them....for what? Is that the question of this film.... What are we searching for and what are we capable of during the search to find and ACHIEVE it? Secondarily, do we even understand ourselves well enough to define our happiness when we so easily toss away the things we search for once we have them?If character development is your thing, this could be your film. If you wish to feel good afterwards, RUN RUN RUN from this film....

Fans will tell you that theirearly tours were the best. I would agree. This will leaveyou breathless as it captures them in full stride duringthe Crossing tour.

I've had this since it was released, and was convinced that itwas not nearly as good as Rock Art and the Xray style. Joe'sVERY UNFORTUNATE death promped me to re listen, and add a review.What I hear is an artist more determined, much like Peter Gabriel, to embrace the many diverse musical sounds that fill ourworld. At the same time, Joe has a story to tell about avariety of topics. In one of his last interviews, Joe indicatedthat he was tired of The Clash overshadowing his work giventhat he still had alot to say. This album is proof that Joewas as vital when this was released as his day's with the Clash.I only hope that the recordings for the 3rd Mescaleros recordfind their way out.

As a long time fan, hearing these different tracks spanning much of their career is an absolute joy. Their sound really did evolve from the hardcore ebow to more straight forward guitar/vocal delivery. I must admit to being very preferential to the older sound... This is totally worth it for the soundtrack to RN alone!!!!
