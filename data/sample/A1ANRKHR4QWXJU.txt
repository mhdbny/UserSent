This album is a concert live recording in 1997 in Washington, DC. Since then, Iranian musicians, particularly Kayhan Kalhor of this Dastan Ensemble, have successfully honed their compositions and improvisations toward more contemporary styles. The album has two sections of poetry and musical approaches: the first, honoring Jalladin Molavi, whose text is that of one in embrace of the Beloved, Allah, has a traditional or classical format; the second poem is by Hafez, and his perspective, that of the seeker, is arranged within a modern musical composition. The mode of both is bayat-e esfahan. This is a fine performance and arrangment, though it seems to lack emotional verve. I believe it pales against the more recent recording of Rumi poetry by Shahram Nazeri and his son's Rumi Ensemble, with their romantic and passionate compositions and performance. I recommend purchasing the CD from one of the Amazon merchants whose prices are far better.

Before I attended a performance of Gorecki's third quartet by Kronos, which should have provided a more acute appraisal of the work, I read a review of this CD by Joshua Kosman, the classical music critic of the SF Chronicle, who said: "I find it drab and almost unlistenable", though he assumed that others would find the quartet profound. I regret that I must agree with the critic. This piece could have easily been reduced in length by 50% and thereby be more successful. Instead, the five-movement work is a set of see-sawing of bows, 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2 in slow dirge upon dirge, representing loss and fading memories. The composition is nearly a drone and tedium arises quickly. I supposed that it could be regarded as a meditation, but there is hardly a focus. The fourth movement has some expressive tunes that emerge from the gloom, but they disappear in the last largo. Gorecki had written this Kronos-commissioned quartet ten years before he finally released it to them. He said that he did not really know the reasons behind the delay. He should have kept the score in the drawer.

A recent documentary has noted that it is difficult to distinguish the respective compositional arrangements of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, so in sync were they in understanding the men of the orchestra and their sound. Perhaps. I have long suspected that Strayhorn soon became the dominant arranger, and this album of well-known Ellington works retooled by Strayhorn may prove the point, though the synergy was probably superior to either's contribution. Aside from such academic conjecturing, this album is outstanding. Johnny Hodges' saxophone is at the fore, with his smoothed-out Bechet melodic lilt. ***** for him! There is a soft, relaxed spirit throughout, evident in Jeeps Blue's and even Juice-a-Plenty. A caveat is that Jimmy Jones is at the piano, so do not expect the minimalism of Ellington or the sensitivity of Strayhorn. The high resolution digital mastering makes this 1961 setting as sharp as a tack. This is a very fine addition to the Ellington collection.

You would think that such 5-star ratings by obvious fans would indicate a classic recording, but they are too generous and insufficiently critical. Yes, the sound engineering is excellent and the sultry mood is perfectly achieved. Compared to her outstanding ground-breaking first recording and her second more mellow follow-up, however, this recording is actually third rate: good but certainly inferior to her earlier releases. The first two tracks are throw-aways; their production seems solely to set a mood. The inclusion of an American standard, here Cole Porter's Night and Day, has become a Brazilian cliche in song selection. While her supporting musicians are fine, the arrangements are not particularly interesting. My review will receive many nay votes in helpfulness, but if you do consider the relativity of this CD with her previous works, you should be disappointed. The Amazon editor casts this recording as good background music for a brunch. I would prefer a recording for more serious listening.

This is fun. Here is a modern album with modern sound capturing the vibration of Bix Beiderbecke. Dick Hyman did the arrangements and play the piano in the ensemble. Tom Pletcher is the cornet master honoring the jazz pioneer. David Sager, trombone, Vince Giordano, saxophone, Bob Learly, banjo, Dan Levison, clarient, and Ed Metz, Jr., drums round out the group. We thus hear old-time, 1920 Jazz Age music styles with a knowing flair from today's esteemed musicians. With a little imagination we can transport ourselves to 1926 in front of the bandstand at a smokey Detroit ballroom, or Bix ducking out Paul Whiteman's band in New York to jam with Gershwin at a Broadway theater. Dick Hyman, as in track 5, But Not For Me, does have a Gershwin touch, and Pletcher produces a Bix-inspired tone. There is one vocal on the album, Bob Leary singing. I like the cover artwork, too. You do not need to be a New Orleans or Dixieland jazz fan. Enjoy!

A search for music recordings of Brazilian or Amazonian Indians will produce very few examples. A couple are ethnomusicological documents. Another type incorporates Indian music within elaborate urban big band compositions. Marlui Miranda's Totos Os Sons is such an example. Another is this album, Okolokolo. Whether you obtain this album by .mp3 download or Amazon's CD-R, you will know next to nothing about the music or band, as there are no included notes. This is a shame, since the music is excellent. It appears that excerpts of Amazonia Indian pieces are directly merged into these pieces, which could be described as electronic dance music or new age. The music expands on melodies and rhythms of the Indians, and we hear on one track an extended narration in Indian language. The music was composed and arranged by Thierry Soret, Pierre Miramont, and Christophe Hugues Loriot; Amazonian Indians were recorded by Christophe Gstalder (who also took the photographs of the original CD notes). Despite the dearth of information, I do want to recommend this album. First, it because of the rarity of such music and, second, because the music actually is enjoyable and fascinating. It makes me want to venture into the Amazon basin to hear the direct music of Indian peoples in person.

This CD is more than Rodrigo's Concerto. Most reviewers ignored the Albeniz, but before I get to those tracks, I will say that the Concerto de Aranjuez is a live recording and that spark does manifest. Narciso Yepes, Julian Bream, and John Williams are better classical guitarists than Paco de Lucia, but in this recording the partner orchestra has a superior performance than others. Morever, de Lucia's third movement is more sensitive than his guitar colleagues. On the negative side, this is an old recording and the sound engineering is very good but not up to the standards of today. The guitar, a quiet instrument, merges with the orchestra. The concerto for guitar seems more concerto for symphony orchestra and guitar. Together, however, this version, indeed interpetation, as the label notes, is very fine but not outstanding. As for the 3-guitar version of three excerpts from Iberia by Isaac Albeniz, I find them entirely wrong in musical concept. Listen to Alicia de Larroucha perform the suite as it should be, on piano. The guitars are tinny and the musical punch is lost. The piano is orchestral in its range and we truly hear the melodies and feel the emotions of each section. Thus, given a choice, I would choose another album with Rodrigo's concerto.

Tasty and satisfying, richly developed, polished and mellow: such is the music performed by Hank Jones, Elvin Jones, and George Mraz, matured jazz veterans in 1993 when they recorded this album. The title "On Reflection" is apt as they offer their quiet arrangments on brother Thad Jones's themes with a touch of nostalgia but no melancholy or solemnity. This is a celebration of a musical life. Engineered by Rudy Van Gelder with full description notes in the insert, the album is a powerful statement. One of my favorite tracks, "Mean What You Say," is an up-tempo arrangement that features keen solo work by all three musicians, particular Elvin Jones, who can finally release from his tempered brush work on previous pieces. Here, then, is an album not for the cellar but now for your pleasure.

Kazakhstan, a large Central Asian nation bordering China and Siberia, Russia, is known for two musical instruments. The first is the dombra lute with its hard-driving, brash strumming. The second, featured in this recording, is the bowed kyl-kobyz. Like a two-stringed cello, it much resembles a magical, shamanistic device, with its mirror, feathers, and hanging pieces of metal. The instrument is carved from a single piece of wood and the central cavity is partially covered with hide. Its sound is a rich baritone. In the hands of musician Raushan Orabaeva, the instrument sings softly, gently. Although the tunes are related to folk tales, animals, and nomadic activities, the music suggests the open steppes and the musician alone in the wilderness. This is a beautiful, quiet, introspective album. And although it is but a single instrument with just two strings, the enchanting music seems so much more. On the same disc is a 15-minute video of Orazbaeva playing in concert. Issued in 2004, the recording is no longer being manufactured and must now be sought. Capture this shooting star and be delighted by timbre and tunes.

It all makes sense. John Lewis helped make the Modern Jazz Quartet a classy group and jazz a high art of the chamber. An elegance of manner and in jazz arrangement were hallmarks. In this surprising and delightfully intelligent album, Lewis goes solo with a very contemporary performance of somewhat staccato style and spare rendition of mainly standards, including Cherokee, September Song, Django, and April in Paris. His sound seemes similar to none I have heard before, though I did associate some patterns with Fred Hersh and the overall inventiveness with Jessica Williams. The pieces also had the rhythmic quirkiness of Thelonoius Monk and the soulful wit of Mary Lou Williams, as in her Zodiac Suite. Moreover, it has the developmental flavor of jazzy classical compositions by Friedrich Gulda or Nikolai Kapustin. All of this and beyond. I listen with fascination and awe. This is sophisticated, clever, eyebrow-raising, ear-grabbing piano work by a master. The only minus is that Lewis hums very softly as he plays, less noticeable than Glenn Gould or Keith Jarrett (to drop yet more names in comparison).

Decades ago Joo Gilberto brought gentle romance to Brazilian music with his soft, lush voicing to bossa nova. The frenetic choros and heavy beat sambas had a flip side: Amoroso and Brazil melted hearts. Since then, many Brazilian singers have applied the soft, loud whispers in romantic popular styles backed by strings, sweet acoustic guitar, and quiet piano. Dori Caymmi in this album carries on that spirit. This is more than dinner jazz; it is late night music. Caymmi chose tunes by his contemporary song writers and recruited some of them to perform with him: Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, sister Nana Caymmi, brother Danilo Caymmi, and Renato Braz. Milton Nascimento's very familiar Ponta de Areia is followed by Ivan Lins and Vitor Martin's Lembra de Mim, which is arranged so romantically that I thought I was watching young lovers in a movie. Choro Bandido is next, but Edu Lobo and Chico Buarque's choro is taken slowly and thoughtfully. Gilberto Gil's Procisso is also taken slower than usual, emphasizing the phrases and poetry. The fastest, brightest track, Bala Com Bala, Joo Bosco and Alider Blanc's composition, is an exception to the album's romantic and melancholy tone, which otherwise smoothes away worries and turns life's difficulties bitter-sweet. This is a beautiful album, one for your musical pharmacy, one for that special someone.

1959 was a good year for Latin jazz when jazz lovers, coming to the second Montery Jazz Festival, attended a pre-concert in nearby Carmel and discovered Cal Tjader, who had been in the comparative backwater of the West coast playing and recording jazz tunes with a Latin rhythm section. That night, listeners heard Willie Bobo on timbales and drum set and Mongo Santamaria on bongos and other percussion. They found Paul Horn on flute and also saxophone, Lonnie Hewitt on piano, and Al McKibbon on bass, while Tjader mellowed the timbre with his vibes. Only a few tunes had an up-tempo, vigorous Afro-Cuban feel; straight ahead ballads, such as Laura and We'll Be Together Again, and mainstream grooves, original or neo-standards, such as Walkin' with Wally and 'Round Midnight, were well represented. After all, this was a mixed, mainly mainstream audience, and there was something for everyone. This 78-minute live album, consisting of tracks from the two original LPs, sound great. That is good engineering, both at the time and with mastering afterwards. The album, in short, is historic and brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. I particularly liked the Latin pieces, Tu Crees Que, for instance.

This is the music label's offical anthology of Pharoah Saunders recordings during the peak of the Cultural Revolution, when he was a participant and then follower of John Coltrane's spiritual explorations. We hear Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt from "Tauhid"; the complete track from "Karma" of The Creator Has a Master Plan; Astral Traveling from "Thembi"; and from "Elevation", Spiritual Blessing. With these particular works, Saunders lifted the flag of avant-garde world jazz, and with Yusef Latiff and Alice Coltrane incorporated Eastern spirituality and modal sound, particularly the drone in jazz. These selections are truly core and delightful. Other recordings would follow, such as "Jewels of Thought" (also on Impulse) and "Journey to the One" (with sitar and koto) before focusing on Africa. Therefore, this album is another very fine 'Best of' for your 1960s collection.

The fine combination of pianist Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin and composer Nikolai Kapustin was featured on the extraordinary album "In A State Of Jazz," in which Kapustin's Sonata No. 2 surprised this classical and jazz fan. That beautiful jazz-influenced piece was not the exception, as this wonderful album demonstrates. As I listened with tearful eyes of joy, I am in a rapture of the mind-blowing piano perfomance of Hamelin (who can play the notes of the scores of Alkan, Liszt, and Chopin) and of the luxurious melodies, romantic rhythms, and edgy modern European etudes that is the synthesis of romantic classical and postmodern jazz. Fantasies, show-stoppers, reveries, dances, touches of Bernstein, Corea, Willie "the Lion" Smith, and the tunesmiths of the Great American Songbook envelop the listener. This is not your grandfather's classical music, not counting Gershwin's rhapsodies, preludes, and piano concerto. Full of vitality, the album soars for 77 minutes, dropping musical notes of happiness behind. Listen! And spread the word.

When Encuentros first was issued in 1985, it was as if a tidal wave had swept me off my feet. Already a lover of flamenco, this was my introduction to music of Morocco, which eventually became an early focus of my studies. It was hardly a gross fusion, being Andalusian, if separated by a few centuries and influences. Juan Pe&ntilde;a, El Lebrijano, was a major gypsy flamenco singer whose voice was not rough, as many, but rich and smooth yet passionate. The Arabo-Andalusian orchestra of Tangier is a well recognized performing ensemble of la classical suites and unique in including a woman vocalist. Together in this album, they weave Spanish and popular Moroccan tunes and language into perfect arrangements that are lively, danceable, and joyous. Brightly recorded, the album feels much too short, and we want it to go on and on. Welcome to the Kasbah; the exchange of musical idioms here has a long tradition. This is an excellent recording pure and simple.

What is interesting about this CD by Dobet Gnahore is her polyglot singing: Dida and Guere of her own Ivory Coast; Wolof of Senegal; Malinke of Mali; Xhosa of South Africa; Fon of Benin; and Lingala of the Congo. There is also a brief vocalise polyphony in homage of the Pygmies. She has a warm, soft voice and the various African styles are nicely arranged and well performed. True, the CD does not have an instant popular "hit" song and she does not dominate with a unique sound, yet the album overall is a relaxed tour of Africa in the same spirit as Putumayo's Acoustic Africa CD and tour, which included the contribution by Gnahore. From the inserted notes and pictures, she may have exciting stage presence. This CD is not of classic calibre, but I still very much enjoyed listening to it, about 5 times now. It provides a sense of quiet dignity and passion.

I am a night clencher, not a grinder, and after wasting good money on a boil-fixed, teeth-molded dental guard that was uncomfortable and hard, I invested in this guard of different design. What a major difference: it is comfortable; easy to get used to; of softer, cushioning plastic; and supportive of mouth relaxation during sleep. This item is the middle level of three products by this company and has the advantage over the first by having retaining wings to prevent slippage. If you are a grinder, I do not know how well the guard will stand up to the rubbing and friction (it is guaranteed for 3 months), but for clenchers, it is excellent.

Sefarad Spain, particularily the zone of Andalusia, was more of a time than a place, a period when Jewish, Muslims, and Christians shared the same dress, the same instruments, and often the same melodies. These tunes were of the Jewish community from their last period in Sefarad and thereby sung in the language of Ladino. Liderman is a composer whose modern works are interesting but not always accessible. These pieces, however, are very much so, as the melodies are fundamentally the same as catalogued. Liderman's innovation is his arrangements, rhythmic patterns, and the choice of instruments. Violin and guitar are an unusual but a good pairing. The guitar is Spain and keeps us anchored in its spirit. The violin takes the place of the customary soprano. The assortment of tunes are varied and keeps our attention. The recording is nicely engineered, the artists' performance is excellent, and we are left in a good mood and somewhat nostalgic for place many of us have never been and a time no one today knows.

John Luther Adams is an atmospheric, poetic composer based in Alaska who paints sonic portraits of wildnerness up north amid empty tundra, rugged mountains, and vast ice flows. The weather can be powerful in wind and snow, lighting and thunder, and its arctic and subarctic light is special, a true land of the midnight summer sun and prolonged winter nights. Daylight can be of extended mornings or late afternoon, and the horizon over snow fields can fade into a white haze. On this album, six musicians, playing bass clarinet, violin, double bass, piano, vibraphone and marimba, and electric keyboard and programming, instill through tremolos a shimmering glow of light reflections and sparkles of ice, fast streams, or wide lakes. Comprising half of the 51-minute album, the third track places emphasis on unbounded space where actions are slow and deliberate. Adams' music is quiet, gentle, and steady, hence somewhat meditative. A minimalist classical composer who is appreciated by spiritual New Age fans, he has a unique musical voice; and though his works skirt the edge of tedium, they conjure Big Nature.

'Tis a pity that these quartets (Volume 1 and 2, Naxos) of Neilsen are not included in the repertoire of the many quartets that frequent the Bay Area. They are certainly romantic and lyrical and complex of interplay and rhythm as the better known romantic composers. Indeed, while I have seen all of Neilsen's symphonies and his violin concerto performed, I, like many other reviewers, had no knowledge of these quartets until Amazon's recommendation algorithm led me to them. Although the earlier quartets lack the great tension or theme that engages us fully, Op. 44 is rich in mood (e.g., the Adagio con sentimento religioso) and symphonic in sweep. It is mature and well-developed, acknowledged by Neilsen himself, and truly delightful. I personally find Neilsen's first quartets a parade of musical statements, each movement interesting but not satisfying in the whole. Op. 13, with its thematic recapitulation, does attempt to string the units together. The Oslo Quartet (and their sound engineers) give us very worthy albums. Budget priced, these recodings should be included in your classical collection, but if you want only one CD, I suggest obtaining Volume 1, with the better Op. 44.

When you open the album, you see the smiling, beaming face of Sabri Moudallal and the cityscape of Aleppo with its mosques and minarets. The music is not religious (except the last 14 minutes), but its effect reaches into the heart. The music is not pop but it is of the people. The music is traditional yet it is full of vocal improvisation with modern influences. The master singer Moudallal is a true artist. He does not perform before before an audience, he converses with his audience with his joy and his pathos. His presentation is in the form of suites, and here he is supported by oud, qanun, riqq, kamandja violin, and ney. The maqam of the extensive first section is hijaz, probably the most popular of the Near East with its feelings of desire, devotion, a touch of melancholy, and a feeling of the vast desert. Later, following a long bright song about love not being easy, instrumental interludes are in bayati, aptly evoking suffering and separation. Trained in the muezzin style and serving as muezzin of the Great Mosque of Aleppo, Moudallal sings the hymns and the call to prayer of the final suite with outstanding fervor. You need not understand Arabic to appreciate this music; tarab, emotion, is conveyed. Duration is 74 minutes.

A third opinion is in order. First, this is Alam Khan's debut [2001] recording. I saw him ealier in peformance with Ali Akbar Khan, where he contributed little. He is indeed young and has a long road ahead of him, especially since his father died in 2009. His much older brother Aashish Khan is a highly experienced sarod master, who studied under Allaudin Khan, Ali Akbar Khan's father. In a way, the album is a follow-up to Ali Akbar Khan's recording, Passing on the Tradition.But this album is not about young Alam, despite the title. It is about the "feminine" raga Ragaini Puriya Dhanasri performed live in an intimate setting. By mytho-tradition, there are 6 principal male ragas: Bhairav, Malkauns, Hindol, Deepak, Shri, and Megh. Each rag has 5 raginis female partners (from which 8 offspring ragas are developed). Of the evening Puriya form, which is associated with discord and absence, this ragini manifests pathos and power and ultimately cheer but not tranquility.What, then, about the performance and recording itself? This is not a true jugulbandi, or duet, since there are no equal partners. Alam provides mainly scale emphasis and iteration. His playing is not as strong or confident as his father. His improvisations are not elaborate. The rare ragini shows its ancient origins and it is good to have an example on record. In short, a connoisseur of Hindustani music and collector of Ali Akbar Khan's performances would definitely desire the album, but I would look for another recording if I were interested only in the better examples of Ali Akbar Khan's art.

This Side Up is the predecessor to the outstanding Live at Yoshi's volumes. While the solo Williams is an inner meditative explorer, she swings outside in trio mode, here with Ray Drummond, bass, and Victor Lewis, drums. As in all well-matched trios, there is synergy and good interplay. Little Bird Song and especially the Theme for the Eulipians are the highlights of the album for me. Obliged to compare this recording with the Grammy-nominated albums that followed, I awarded it 4 stars. The song selection, which I found uninteresting, is also a factor. Overall, I felt that in this album the trio was making adjustments, ironing out the kinks. It is a fine album, surely, but consistency is lacking; it lacks spark. The trio will ignite when they travel to Yoshi's and record before an audience.

First, this is Emperor of the Sarod, VOLUME 1. Second, despite other Amazon listings to the contrary, the manufacturer (Chhanda Dhara) is still producing this album (August 2009). These administrative aspects over, here then, is a wonderful recording by the late Ali Akbar Khan performed in concert in Stuttgart, Germany. Of the late night Kanada family, Raga Bageswari Kanada incorporates Raga Bageshwari, whose associated verse, in reference to Krishna, is "He has torn my heart out since he has gone; I have lost my mind." Thus, the mood is of devotion and pathos, and as Khan beautifully develops the alap into the jor stage, we sense the ache and longing and the seriousness of the dark night. The mood shifts somewhat with the 16-beat gat and a happy calm emerges. Listening to Khan's astonishing performance supported by Swapan Chaudhuri's keen tabla improvisations, we fall under the spell of the raga. I miss Khansahib, but I am thankful for such extraordinary recordings to keep his music alive.

Chechnaya and Ostessia are in the news again (July 2009). We know of its battles and strife regarding their status as Russian Federations, but otherwise Americans are ignorant about these and adjacent, mainly Muslim lands, which are located in the north Caucasus, that isthmus between the Black and Caspian Seas. Georgia and Azerbaijan are to their south and below them, Turkey and Iran. Buffer lands throughout the world are known for their political resistance and the rise of independent cultural styles. One of the easy ways to know something about a culture is to hear and study its folk music. This album of DAT field recordings of indigenous traditional music by Michael Church provides that opportunity.Histories, heroic tales, work songs, lullabies, romances, and dances are sung solo or in chorus and often accompanied by accordian, hand clapping, balalaika, and indigenous percussion and fiddle. From the tracks we gain an appreciation of the social role of music. The enclosed booklet includes an extensive background and history of the peoples in this region -- Chechens, Circassians/Adighis, Balkarians, Karachaveans, Ingush, Ossetians, and Dagestani -- in addition to comments on each track and translations of lyrics. The music has an angry energy with a strong sense of self. This important musical survey of 24 examples in 72 minutes will be of interest to ethnomusicologists, historians, and anyone curious about this scarcely studied region.

The CD version is nice because of its being a live recording of her recent material, but the DVD is a treasure. It is a well directed, multi-camera presentation that takes you into the recital hall so intimately that you feel more at being a small jazz club, much like I experienced when I saw her trio at Oakland and in San Franicsco. The PBS program is OK, with more music, but real insight came with the interview, wherein she answered some personal questions of life and her take on the music. That you can receive both discs for a slight increase in price of the usual independent jazz or classical CD is a deal you should not pass up. And a word about her drummer, Davis: he plays percussion like a melody instrument in perfect sync with the piano. Indeed, this trio is so synergistic that it is a wonder to behold.

Originally recorded and issued between 1963 and 1974 by the audiophile Connoisseur Society, the Signature Series remastered and released by Alam Madina Music Productions (established by Ali Akbar Khan himself) are masterworks by one of the greatest Indian musicians and teachers in modern times. Ali Akbar Khan passed away in June 2009, but these recordings will allow his music to live on. Volume 2 of the series is a particular favorite of mine. No one can develop a raga as Khan; his inventiveness and emotional depth were extraordinary. The first rag, Medhavi, is a combination of several ragas; the process of combining ragas is a common synthesis, although few of the tens of thousands of raga scales can be merged. Khan was fortunate to have Mahapurush Misra as his tabla accompanist for these recordings, for few were Khan's match in responsiveness and furthering the mood and passion of the raga and Misra was brilliant. While the first two ragas have a 16-beat rhythm (tintal), the last raga, another combination, has an unusual seven-beat rhythm (rupak tal) and includes a ragmala, which is a ring of a few phrases of other raga scales, akin to a medley. This recording is highly meditative and profound in every way. Khan will deepen his exploration of the rag over the following decades, but already his powerful, crisp performance and spiritual concentration are manifest. Five star ratings are supposed to be "outstanding"; well, this recording is an essential musical milestone. I still shake my head at its peerlessnes.

It is late morning, quiet, and you are filled with resolve, spiritual or mundane. This album is the soundtrack. Morning Visions is actually part of the Signature Series, without that category name, because it includes Mahapurush Misra on tabla and was recorded as part of the audiophile Connoisseur Society series of 1963 to 1974. This remastered edition presents, first, rag Mian-ki Todi, an old imperial composition. Ali Akbar Khan spends 20 minutes on the alap, a rhythm-free improvisation without drum, and even then the track is slightly truncated. The music is profound and passionate. The second track continues the performance with Misra propelling the music to its fast and strong conclusion. The last track is rag Sindhu Bhairavi, always associated with the morning. Its mood is more active and ends with a driving gat as a call for action. These are brilliant performances by supreme masters of the art.

By the mid 1990s, Ali Akbar Khan's public perfomances in the San Francisco Bay Area had grown from intimate venues to large auditoriums, and he performed often. This live recording is from one such occasion in May 1995. The first raga on the album is a late evening mode, Marwa. [George Harrison used this scale in his "Marwa Blues".] There are only 6 notes to the scale, both ascending and descending. On the sarod, it is difficult to play, since two open strings must not sound and care must be taken in improvisation lest phrases may sound "off" and the emotional level of the piece may be broken. But to provide musical interest and value, risks must be taken and, here, Ali Akbar Khan meets the challenge, as we expect from the great master. Listening closely to the raga, we can hear him skirt disaster. Marwa is restricted to the alap, the first, rhythm-free section. When the tabla of Swapan Chaudhuri enters, Khan shifts to the combined raga Puriya Kalyan. The mood also changes from heroic devotion to joyful peace.The title of the album, Passing on Tradition, refers to the guru-student lineage of a musical style from the 16th century emperor's court musician; eventually to Mohammed Wazir Khan; to Ali Akbar Khan's father Allaudin Khan; to Ali Akbar Khan, Khan's sister Annapurna Devi, and also to Ravi Shankar; and then to Khan's own sons, Aahish Khan and Alam Khan. Receiving a Grammy nomination, this album presents the school's style in fine fashion.

With the recent death of Ali Akbar Khan (June 2009), all recordings of his have taken on greater import. Thus, this anniversary edition looks back to 1955 and the first Western release of Hindustani music. (It was also when I was introduced to such music.) Remarkably, that old recording, now remastered onto digital disc, still is wonderful art, full of energy and melody for the first piece, befitting a late morning rag, and thoughful, passionate, and romantic for the second rag, common to early evening. Khan was then but age 33, a journeyman in a musician's life, though even at that time he was an acknowledged master.The second disc consists of works performed in 1994 when Khan was a vigorous, young 73. Part one is a solo, a rhythm-free alap, an improvisation of springtime. Tabla wizard Zakir Hussain accompanied him on the second part, a gat and synthesis of two ragas. Here, the mood lifts with a sense of peace and inner joy. On this day there was none of the blazing fireworks or playful, humorous exchanges that I had witnessed in similar concerts of theirs around this period. And I miss it. The music is very fine but relatively tame and stately. Nonetheless, the improvisations on both sarod and tabla are strong and demonstrate how far and how short Ali Akbar Khan had come over the years. The enclosed booklet is valuable for its photographs, history, and discography.

This particular album of the Voyager budget series is said to be no longer available; thus, this review is for those intrepid music lovers who will search alternative sources. (1) There are few good recordings of Maori music, which makes this album particularly worthwhile. The sound is excellent, the music is strong and powerful on some tracks, beautifully melodious on other tracks. The tunes here are of the typical Polynesian harmonies and contemporary in feeling. (2) Do not be confused with the cover photograph of a Maori meeting house: it is a stock image and is used on different, inferior recordings. (3) No text of explanation is provided, leaving us in the dark about location, group, translation and nature of the songs. (4) The music is sweet and enjoyable. (5) The popular introduction to Maori culture came to Americans from the movie, The Whale Rider. If you are able to obtain this album, that film's spirit will continue. Happy hunting!

In miniature format of the original Vanguard vinyl albums, including cardboard and a record sleeve, this collection of beautiful, lyrical works are special treasures, particularly Autumn Song because of the superb support of Walcott, Moore, and McCandless of Oregon, among others. Few recordings of Vasant Rai were made because of his early death. He had a strong sense of melody, and his sarod playing was refined, smooth, and confident. Rai also played flute and guitar on these sessions. Whereas Spring Flowers (1976) is more tentative and jam-like, Autumn Song (1978) was more like a polished gathering of dhuns, light classical or folk tunes; it was a successful pioneering work of fusion by recognized artists well versed in each other's musical idiom. Joy and peace are conveyed in these now historic recordings.

From the Gershwin Rhapsody-quoted opening, the sophisticated arranging and composing of Antonio Adolfo are readily apparent. An accomplished band leader and pianist as well, he is the perfect supportive accompanist for his daughter's vocals. Adolfo, whose mother was in the Brazilian Symphony, studied with both Nadia Boulanger and Deodato and performed with Elis Regina and Milton Nascimento. The live concert of 2007 in Miami, Florida, was recorded well and the sound is clear and distinct, with both presence up-close and in depth. The .mp3 downloads do not allow smooth track transitions as with a continuous CD, but this is a small sacrifice. The excitement of a live recording is perceived. There are compositions by Dori Caymmi, Dorival Caymmi, Baden Powell, Carlos Lyra, and of course Tom Jobim. Adolfos' piano work is elegant. Saboya sings on only a few tracts (track 5, Bonita, is sung in English), but when she does appear, her soprano voice is sensitive, bright, and with jazz feeling. Merely 46 minutes in duration, the happy album is still a grand addition to any collection of Brazilian music.

As a leading star among contemporary cantaors, Diego el Cigala has gathered some young shining lights to support his performance in this spendid, cheerful album. Guitarists vary with track: Paco de Luc&iacute;a and Tomatito are recognized for their pioneering innovations in jazzy flamenco nuevo; Diego Morao (son of Mora&iacute;to Chico) and Manuel Parrilla (son of Juan Parrilla) come from great musical families in Jerez de la Frontera; and Josemi Carmona is the son of Pepe Habichuela. On the first track Bernardo Parrilla, brother of Manuel, plays violin. The music is bright and lively, as we hear tangos, buler&iacute;as, alegr&iacute;a-mirabras, a rumba, and a fandango. Even the last track, a sole&aacute;, is taken fast and painless and includes a muted jazz trumpet. Chorus and palmas emphasize rhythm and excitement. Diego himself sings with the characteristic strained flamenco voice, consistent and with excellent phrasing. Lyrics in Spanish are provided. No deep, slow, serious tunes will be found here. This album is fully contemporary but sufficiently traditional in scope and style to be accepted by purists, particularly considering the more traditional guitarists, such as Parrilla. Like many modern flamenco records, this one is short, merely 37 minutes in duration.

Having owned Turku's first two albums, the surprising Alleys of Istanbul and the, well, rockin' Nomads of the Silk Road, I wondered if their third album would match my expectations. Turku, which hail from South Carolina, play traditionial Turkish instruments (various saz fiddles, tar and ud lutes, violin, and frame and hourglass drums). While the second recordings were more afield in musics of the Anatolian and Caspian areas, the musicians here focus, with one expection, on regions within Turkey. The distinctions of the folk tunes from Istabul, Afyon, Mugla, and Aegean locales provide interest. These are mainly dance pieces, beautifully performed, from stately to spritely in tempo. Some tunes are strangely familiar, for the Ottomans have had musical infuence throughout the Near East and even into Western Europe. Although I still regard Turku's second album as the best of the three, &Ouml;zlem is still very fine. Listening to it, we can imagine ourselves visiting the various villages and joining in the dances.

The performance of Sufi ghazals, romantic poetic songs with religious meaning, is often joyous and ecstatically passionate--and strongly rhythmic and danceable--rather than slow and meditative, as in ragas. When considering contemporary audiences, why should not these traditional melodies be arranged for modern, even Western instruments? Thus, a sort of fusion has been established these days, and among its practitioners is Shafqat Ali Khan, son of Salamat Ali Khan. While he performs with traditional instruments in a subsequent album [Sufi Songs from India & Pakistan], these recordings include a saxophone played by George Brooks, and electric guitars and synthesizers, played by Douglas McKeehan, along with Shafqat's zither. Shafquat sings in Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, and Farsi. One track especially caught my attention: Journey to Marwa, which for 10 minutes is his interpretation of Rag Marwa but with a modern, highly unusual, yet attractive electronic percussion in additional to electronic drones. As a student of the Sham Chaurasi school, Shafqat owes much to dhrupad but has much vocal ornamentation. Lyrics of the ghazals are included in the insert. Of interest, is that Shafqat has three brothers and a sister, all musicians. His brother Sukhawat Ali Khan also explores Sufi fusion styles.

da Silva, born in Pernambunco, was a malcontent from the start. Making his way to Rio and issuing his first album in 1975, he performed at first cocos, Northeastern percussive trance music. He soon switched to popular sambas, but romance was not his way. Known for his irreverance and biting lyrics, yet following original pagode style, he was a pioneer. This album is an anthology of his works from 1985 to 1993. Since I do not understand Portuguese, I miss the effect of lyrics; however, it is clear that he is a not a singer but more a narrator, and there is the flavor of hip-hop, even rap. It is strange listening: a hard vocal edge with the strong samba beat. I feel like Dylan's Mr. Jones, knowing that something is happening but not quite certain what it is. Track words, those recognizable in English that is, are indicative: indigestion; overdose; cobra, violence.

Fred Astaire enthralled the public with his dancing in the many light-hearted films, but his singing was wonderful too. To hear him does awaken memories of his cinematic dancing but his singing evokes an era when popular music was jazz. This limited collection includes most of his well-known favorites. Not all the selections are taken from his films but are rather from original record releases (that even include tap dancing), such as Puttin' On The Ritz, and The Way You Look Tonight. Fascinating Rhythm is also not from a film but it features George Gershwin on piano and Adele Astaire. Another duet has Judy Garland in Easter Parade. If you desire a fair sampling of Fred Astaire songs on a single CD, then this album is a good choice. It is nicely mastered as part of the Columbia Legacy series.

This album of suites of brief piano pieces composed throughout the underappreciated career of George Frederick McKay, a professor at the University of Washington, suggests that he may be an American Poulenc or Debussy. Like Poulenc, his pieces from the 1920s and 1930s are playful winks and are highly melodic of strong national character, in this case of American ragtime, cakewalks, and jazzy riffs, as well as pastorals. His thoughtful, moody summer "patterns" of Lake Tahoe (1965) suggest French Impressionism. Three of five art songs (1964) are presented with cabaret singer Joan Morris and her husband William Bolcom on piano. The final work, a romantic suite for viola and piano from 1948 is also rich in melody and rhythm. It is a wonderful, at times beautiful, chamber piece, and violist Mahoko Eguchi performs it with deep sensitivity. I am very glad that Naxos has brought this American composer to wider attention. Good art will prevail.

After listening to the new CD, Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project, I purchased this CD of field recordings from the Garifuna people of Belize. While Umalali presents a more professional sound, polished by studio processing and embellished at times with guitar and horns, this CD gives us unprocessed samples of any day, anywhere music. Here, percussion dominates the vocals with drums, maracas shakers, clave, and conch shell. The enclosed booklet provides some historical background of the culture, its mixed Carib-Arawak Amer-Indian language supplemented with English, French, and African, and the various musical forms and rhythms. Most tracks seem strongly African influenced, but several others are in Caribbean Latin style (parranda and bolero). Thus, the two CDs complement each other nicely. These raw field recordings emphasize the pure spirit of the Garifuna people and provide presence.

Fiji, a large island group north of New Zealand and southwest of the Samoas, is part of Melanesia. Once a part of the British Empire on the trade route, its music has had several influences, including Indian and Chinese, and European, such as the introduction of the ukelele (an adaptation of a Portuguese instrument) and guitar. The musical major influence is Polynesian, especially the rich multipart harmonies, which itself came from early Missionaries. This recording, however, features the thrilling sound of slit log drums, lali, and bamboo stamping tubes, derua, which augment clave-like sticks and the cupped-hand clapping of singers. The 23-tracks of the 59-minute album cover a variety of meke, dance/song/instrumental combinations: the exciting war dance, spear dance, gentle standing and sitting pieces telling folk tales, and an apparent religious hymn. Two ensembles are heard. The sound quality is satisfactory, but the microphone seems many yards away. The listener seems to be at the back of the village. Repeated listening will discern the variation in musical form, but it is the drumming that I most enjoy.

Some people who seek environmental recordings of running water -- babbling brooks, mountain streams, rivers, and water falls -- desire them for sleep induction or relaxation. Some people dislike bird chirps as distractions from white noise, other people love the reminder of life. I listen to such recordings instead for meditation and room ambiance of outdoor nature, stuck here in a city. This recording of water flowing down a small creek is among the best in my collection for a consistent white noise background with soft punctuation, in the form of a single thrush in the distance. The water is musical, as the various pitches are produced with different levels of water moving over and around obstructions, and occasionally, as a leaf or twig dam is built until broken, a rising pitch is heard. As far as engineering, the recording was made close-in and it is loud; I am obliged to turn the volume control down substantially, the opposite of many other environmental albums. [Ignore average ratings, as choice of such recordings must be tailored for purpose and personality. Consider this album; you may like it as I.]

I do not listen to environmental recordings either to ease myself into sleep or to relax and numb the mind. The very opposite is my goal. I occasionally meditate with such a recording. Since I seek clarity and stillness, I require good sonic engineering, variety in context, and an ambiance that holds interest. Ocean Waves, of the Sounds of the Earth Series, is for me the best of the available ocean recordings. Living near the Northern California coast, I find these particular waves familiar and comfortable. The duration of the recording is 64 minutes. Of course, if you desire to sleep, then the album will help there, too, but when I listen, I am awake to the coolness and the humidity and the far horizon.

Selim Sesler, a Romani, is the dean of Turkish clarinetists. I recently saw him perform in Istanbul and was amazed with his technique and improvisational skills. So were my Middle Eastern musician companions. This album is an example, albeit a mere hint, of his profound style, and it lacks the excitement of my witnessed live jam session. But it will suffice. He is supported on various tracks by violin; bass; kanun; oud; bendir, davul, darbuka, and daf drums; and on one track baglama saz. Two vocals are included among the 13 tracks. Rhythms are 2/4, 9/8, 9/4, and 4/4. Most are traditional tunes but Sesler composed three pieces. This is bright, cheerful, dance music, and you will soon want to move your hands and arms and sway your body to the infectious, sensuous beats.

Anything on Native Amer-Indian music is worthy since so little has been written on it; however, this book is focused on the contemporary scene, the artists and their backgrounds, and their work in the world today. It was more of a cultural magazine anthology than a serious book on musicology: the music itself, lyrics, rhythms, tunes, and their development and historic spread. Note that this small book is even smaller considering that the text of this book is double-spaced, as in a manuscript, probably to increase the thickness of the edition. Although disappointed in the absence of scholarship, being unable to relate in detail the tradition to today's exploration, the information includes many interesting comments and biographical sketches, and shows how this music has left the dusty museum archives to a living, growing art.

This is an architectural book directed toward form and space. For my own pan-Asian decorated home, I adapted one of the interior design features found within a photograph of this excellent book. While sophisticated, urbane restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto are featured, they vary from traditional to ultra-modern industrial in design. Floor diagrams are included. Because most of these restaurants have subdued lighting, the photographs share the same tone; but such lighting design emphasizes details of texture and shape as well as accessories. Indeed, the straight-line geometry of Japanese architecture helps provide a calming and peaceful environment. Because I am an artist and have been to Japan and Korea, I must admit that I am attracted to these places. If you are considering decorating or designing a home with an Asian motif, you may also find inspiration in these photographs.

Of the many recordings of folk music from the nation of Georgia, this one concentrates on table, or drinking and toasting, songs. We first heard such harmonies from male choirs in "Georgian Voices/Rustavi Choir", a major Nonesuch release that opened our ears to this unique polyphony that often creates a drone effect. In this Realword album, originally issued 1988 from Melodiya of Georgia, we hear about 44 minutes of such powerful songs. The album is uniform in tone and tempo, and this perhaps is its only fault. Table songs have a particular, somewhat heroic, style and other albums include love ballads, dances, and work tunes for the sake of variety. Still, world music collecters will want to search for this fine album, no longer in print.

The western region of the island of Java, Indonesia, is Sunda. Here, for the past decade the innovative group SambaSunda, consisting of some 16 members, has created a unique synthesis of musics and has issued six albums. This album is not your customary slow, traditional court or dance gamelan. Consider these musical sources: Balinese gamelan, reggae, samba, salsa, Arabic rhythms, jazz, Sundanese traditional gamelan, and Jaipong, a popular vocal and dance style in Java. Listening to these tracks (better, if you can find their anthology, The Sunda Music, on Rice Records, UK), you will hear an unusual assortment of rich melodies and rhythms. Ismet Ruchiat, the leader of this experimental ensemble, worked in Norway and Iceland in the 1990s where he played with jazz groups and expanded his musical vision. The Indonesian vocal style, the gongs and drums and equivalents of flute, oboe, xylophone (metal and bamboo), and violins firmly place SambaSunda in Indonesia, but many of the songs are strongly Western influenced. The album is great fun, a sort of Southeast Asian jazz. I dig it!

The original two LP anthology of 1966 had the intention of providing a representative survey of the entire dastgah mode system, and at that period, when world music was a tiny section in record shops and of interest mainly to ethnomusicologists and people from a given country, the Folkways records were very fine. But this CD reissue fails the mission by leaving out two, albeit little played, dastgah: Rast-panjgah and Nava. A third missing track is a drum solo. While the solo performances of the musicians (Ahmad Ebadi, setar and tar; Asghar Baharai, kamancheh; Hohamad Heydari, santour; Houshang Zarif, tar; Hassan Kassayi, nei; Ali Tajvidi, violin; Nasser Efetah, drum; Hossein Fakhei and Khatereh Parvanhel, voice) are excellent indeed, the audio quality is not especially good by standards of today. Some tracks are tinny or flat and distant. If you are a serious collector, then, yes, this CD is certainly worthy; otherwise, I suggest that any more recent recording of Iranian music will provide a better introduction.

This is a Smithsonian-Folkways album of music that accompanied an exhibition. Thus, the selections meet specific requirements of the art and artifacts; yet, I find it an exceptionally good anthology of tribal music of New Mexico that make a fine portait. The first series of traditional drum and rattle dance tunes from the various pueblos (Picuris, San Juan, Taos) of the Zuni and Din&eacute;/Navajo communities, while similar in style, differ by tone and tempo. With close listening, they can reach into the marrow. They are more danceable than meditative. Simple two-step dances dominate. The mood shifts dramatically at track 11, with a quiet flute song. What follows are modern songs and tunes, bringing Native American traditions into contemporary situations. Paul Ortega's The Handshake always chokes me up with its humanity and compassion. Ortega, accompanied by Sharon Burch, next present a bright, skipping tune of joy. His section concludes with a simple song of traveling. Again, a flute marks a divide followed by a lovely, happy, anthem-like welcoming song by Burch. A third solo flute piece leads to a contemporary take on tradition: it is a round dance song sung in modern harmony, with flute and electronic keyboard drone. It is beautiful. The final track is sung by Geraldine Barney, a song arising from the loneliness of the Native American in the modern city. A booklet provides details about the tracks, the artists, the instruments, and the different styles.

The list of review excerpts is entirely accurate. The ensemble sets the tone of this album with a hauntingly sweet solo Armenian dudduk, which the ensemble soon joins into a nostalgic, slow dance. The oud continues the improvization, and before we are aware of it, we are transported to another place and time. The feeling and enchantment persists through the CD, whether clearly Israeli Jewish or Arab Sufi, or influenced by Turkish, Egypian, or Sefarad songs. The tempo is a fairly consistent andante, with an occasional allegro or largo. Do not expect rollicking dance music. The subtitle of "Sacred Music of the Middle East" is validated, for peace and brotherhood arises. Yuval Ron is a recipient of many grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rockefeller Foundation and has lectured extensively.

At present, three recordings of Egyptian Sufi music are available and this review will describe commonality and their key differences. Sufism, as other mystical sects of various religions, have different schools or brotherhoods, although they share approaches: chiefly repetiton (like mantras and holotropic breathing) of "Allah", usually accompanied by in-place movement or more vigorous dancing, Qur'anic recition, and inspiring hymns or sma'a. [The Turkish and Syrian Sufi schools include the dervishes whose stately whirling are well known.] The Sufi gathering is a hadra and dhikrs are the rituals and practices.Featuring Mohamed al Helbawy is the recording Egyptian Sufi [ARC]. The recording has more echo, or depth, and is clearer than the following album. Also, instruments are included: a kawala flute and drum. Here, the choir consists of four members; two others are musicians. Only hymns are offered; there is no sense of dhikr exercises as suggested in the below album. However, the superior quality of the engineering plus the addition of instruments make the album more inspiring, more effective. al-Helbawy seems stronger, richer in voice, too.La Chdhiliyya, Sufi Chants from Cairo [Instut de Monde Arabe], also features hymnist/munshid Sheikh Mohamed al Helbawy and 14 accompanists as chorus. The recordings are of the series of dhikr, hymns, and liturgies from the calling to prayer to the invocation. No instruments are involved; only clapping sometimes occur. The listener becomes sensitive to the passionate quality of the singer and the gravity of the rite. This is not a field recording and there is no sense of community. I found the album rather arid and was not moved. I suggest you chose the former album.The 2-CD alubm of Sheikh Admad al-Tuni, the Sultan of All Munshidin [Wagram] was recorded in Theatre de la Ville in Paris. He is accompanied by nine singers and musicans, who play oud, ney flute, kamanga violin, and drums (riqq, tabaleh, naqrazan). As cantor, al-Tuni has charisma in his voice. Bathing in the enveloping sound of the instruments, his phrasing and repetitions and has power (much like a flamenco singer...a historical offshoot). The songs are slow and meditative with oud improvisations leading to fast, rhythmic dancing. While a concert, there is dhikr spirit, as no doubt the audience must be swaying in their seats. Sam is manifest. These recordings are the best of the lot.

The San Francisco Bay Area has lately been making waves in Latin Jazz and Brazilian music. Mike Marshall has been a musical advocate for choros, and a bevy of other artists have gathered to further his efforts and to bring other Brazilian jazz to audiences. Among them are Mike Spiro on percussion, Harvey Wainapel, saxophone, Macros Silva, keyboards, Santos Neto piano and arranger [not performing on this album], and the Cressmans: daughter Natalie and husband Jeff on trombones and Sandy on vocals. This is Sandy Cressman's second 'solo' album. Her warm, spirited and sensitive voicing does justice to composers Baden Powell, Dori Caymmi, Nelson Mota, Hermetto Pascoal, Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque, Edu Lobo, and Tom Jobim, among others. Her arranger for these recordings is Rio-born Marcos Silva. These excellent musicians swing, which is to say that while the music has a mellow Brazilian heart, it is perfused with jazz sensibilities. I very much enjoyed this album and hope one day to see them perform.

The lifespan 1897 to 1973 of Alfredo da Rocha Vianna, Jr, better known as Pixinguinha, covered vast changes in the music of Brazil, much to his own efforts. The development from European waltzes and especially polkas to the Afro-Brazilian influenced, and torso-to-torso risqu&eacute;, maxixe soon by 1880 led to the Brazilian equivalent of ragtime, the choro. This was at first a reference to instrumention, typically an informal trio of bass-providing guitar, flute melody maker, and cavaquinho rhythm and counterpoint, but became established as its own musical style regarded for its rapid weaving lilts, virtuoso playing, and cheerful dances. Pixinguinha composed his first choro at age 14, cut his first record in 1911, and turned professional at age 15. Pixinguinha's instrument was the flute. By the 1920s he began to expand the instrumentation of choro with the introduction of the saxophone and trumpet. Indeed, he was attacked for it, for corrupting choro with American jazz. He was undeterred and became a major arranger and composer, expanding the band instrumentation to include more brass but also many types of Afro-Brazilian percussion. He himself switched to the saxophone in 1947. Choro was chiefly instrumental but samba lent itself well to vocals, and he contributed here too. Carmen Miranda owes some of her fame to his compositions. This album contains 16 tracks of works composed between 1929 and 1947, twelve of which in colloboration with Benedito Lacerda. The album lasts merely 42 minutes. Track 4, Um a Zero and track 7, Tico Tico No Fuba are familiar melodies. Choro is a musical form that refused to die and today, in its third surge, it is spreading around the world. Today, Brazilian samba bands often include choros. This anthology and those of Jacob de Bandolim will provide a historical perspective.

Ratings tend to be inflated on Amazon, but this album of a Zimbabwe a cappella trio, who now study and reside in Austria, is truly outstanding. Insingizi, like the older, famous ensemble Ladysmith Black Mambazo, sing in the mbube style, which has become increasingly popular since the 1940s. Here is a trio that sounds twice their number, with beautiful, well-crafted renditions of songs; they at times include drumming and shakers. Most songs are of religious or moral nature. Their rich baritone chorus and harmony to the lead tenor provide happy listening. The sound quality is absolutely perfect.

A local newspaper classical music critic called this recording "ravishing beautiful" and the effect "stupendous." What? How can that be? I was curious. Riley's In C is a composition with a set of instructions rather than a score per se. He set up 53 different melodies, short and long, in a sequence to be played by any assortment of instruments, each independently per number of repetitions of each stanza and transition to the next. There have been many recordings of In C, all different. I have the original recording on CBS and one with Bang on the Can that seemed more precise in tempo and less chaotic with expanded instrumentation, including Wu Man on pipa. Now, this Ars Nova rendition takes a page from fellow minimalist Steve Reich with sole use of voices and marimbas. What an amazing difference! It reminds me of Javanese gamelan music and, in fact, there is a Balinese gong among the percussion; the mentioned critic thought it much like Medieval vocal music. If you like Reich's works, such as Music for 18 Instruments and Drumming, then this recording belongs in your collection, no matter how many versions of In C you have. Beautiful and stupendous? Remarkably, yes, indeed. In C, that seminal work, once again proves how special it is, for despite being 40-years old, it is yet ageless, continually reinventing itself.

Djavan is a pop star, so I cannot complain that this album is fully American style soulful pop, which even has Stevie Wonder on harmonica on the first track. After all, these are Djavan's melodies and lyrics. He also had a hand in most arrangements, and his wonderful sensitive voice is present throughout. What is missing is the urgency, the spark, the joy of his earlier albums and also the artistry that would appear twenty years afterwards with the outstanding album Milagreiro. In comparison, Luz is too relaxed, although I still very much like it. The album ends well but far too briefly with Minha Irma, a faster, propulsive 2-minutes. The album stems from 1982 and has that 80's feeling. It was recorded and mixed in Los Angeles. This edition is Japanese, and I face liner notes in both Japanese and Portuguese, which is somewhat amusing considering the first track, his popular tune, Samurai.

The first reviewer's overview of the entire output of Camar&oacute;n de la Isla and Paco de Lucia is excellent and I have little to add. This later album, originally issued in 1975, shows how comfortable the artists had become with each other. While the album remains rooted in the traditions (de Lucia's radical jazzy and popular innovations would come later), there is further exploration in guitar chords, deeper intensity in the songs. This edition of the album oddly included a separate sheet showing eye-popping guitar chords over the lyrics! Thus, these recordings were regarded at the time as evolutionary. They already were taking flamenco into modernity. The remastering makes the album sound newly minted. As for the performances, this is powerful stuff. Brilliant guitar work, passionate vocals. It is a pity that the album is so short in duration. A double album or a multi-disc set would make better sense. Meanwhile, listen repeatedly and listen deeper. This recording is among the greatest flamenco albums you will find.

These three delightfully lyrical concerti, with themes respectively of love, harmony, and peace, are all distinct. The middle work is similar to the art of the late composer Lou Harrison, and indeed the canonic and the dance variations of Concerto No. 2 employ a gamelan ensemble as many of Harrison's works. However, Kyr is even more a romantic, and his sweet spiritual music soars and envelops the listener. Ron Blessinger's violin performance is a perfect match for these compositions. The first work on love is indeed amorous, but the third, regarding peace, is not so peaceful at first. It is the not the peace of spiritual or transcendent tranquility but one of aftermath. It must be hard fought to achieve, metaphorically. Drumming, clanging, and clamor give way to lamentation and reconciliation; it ends in resolve, solace, and, yes at last, peace. Robert Kyr, who is at home also in Early Music, is an excellent composer and I look forward to hearing more of his explorations. This particular recording will surprise you in how good it is.

Accordion....triangle.....these are are the instruments of a fringe but regionally popular music in the United States, Cajun, the Lousiana French. Add a drum and you also have the core instruments of another regional form of music, this one of Brazil's Northeast, Forr&oacute;. This is dance music. This is party music. This is country music, centered in Pernambuco, north of Bahia, but heard as far south as Rio. Indeed, it emerged in Rio itself in the late 1940s from the Baio dances of Luiz Gonzaga, a Northeasterner and accordionist. Forr&oacute; is not restricted to one type, one rhythm, and as this anthology demonstrates, with examples between 1960 and 1990, many other influences and fusions occur (reggae, samba, polka, even cumbia), and brass and assorted percussion have been added onto the trio at its heart. Essentially, it is a folk and festival music, chiefly in strong 2/4 time, with origins in the music of native &iacute;ndios and European dances. It is as if you took Cajun music and Brazilian choros and sambas and put them in a blender, each residual lump a different combination. This collection is constantly interesting by its varied sound and sub-styles and is constantly happy. If you think you know Brazilian music, think again. I am late to this music, as David Byrne issued the album 20 years ago, and I am thankful that it remains available. This is a splendid introduction, but now we need an updated anthology to cover the 20 years since.

This album is part of a large series dedicated to Roda de Samba, an Afro-Brazilian dance rooted with capoeira. This group is from So Paulo. It issued its first album in 1991, and this anthology includes works throughout the 1990s. Their songs are pop and soul, and the rhythm is light, though samba. Guitar, electronic keyboards [pseduo stings and horns], and occasional saxophone, chosen over cavaquinho or even banjo, give an "over-produced" sound to my ears. As an anthology, the tracks vary from studio romances to live concerts before enthusiastic audiences who sing along [soft pagode in essence]. The feeling is too light-weight, too teen-oriented for my taste. The lead singer is very good, however.

"Alternate Route" is traveling music along The Third Stream that fuses classical music and jazz. These pieces can be construed as sonatas for trumpet/flugelhorn and orchestra, beginning with modern abstract classical modes passing through Gershwinesque inspirations and ending with Ellingtonian jazz structures, with a nod to Isham's mute. The cinematic arrangements are seductive and enchanted: the disappointed first hearing gives way to extraordinary psychological journeys in repeated playing as the ear adjusts and the mind stops analyzing and just listens. Very few artists have produced true Third Stream works, most contented with symphonic accompaniments to jazz explorations. Beal knows his medium. Here, he collaborates with two excellent orchestras and employs Skywalker mixing to produce a tone poem of delightful, intriguing musical stanzas.

Recorded mainly during a competition of traditional Kazakhstani musicians singing folk tunes and strumming the dombra or bowing the qyl-kobuz, this collection of many short pieces presents a good survey of the folk pieces of this large Central Asian nation, where the nomadic culture and the herding of horses, cattle, sheep, and camel still dominate. A few tracks were recorded with the Folk Ensemble of the Presidenital Orchestra. Additional instruments heard are the violin-like kobuz, a zhetygen zither, another lute called the sherter, a botton accordian, a flute, a jews' harp, and an ocarina. Thus, for 71 minutes and with 27 examples, our musical tour is extensive. Ballads, gentle melodies, epic anthems, and rapid vivacious instrumentals are of many styles and feelings. Kazakhstan and next door Kyrgystan share a heritage, and singing style are much alike. These young musicians are excellent in their performances. Despite being recorded almost serendipitously on a DAT recorder under field conditions, the sound is very good. This album helps fill a gap in the available recordings of Central Asian musics. The enclosed booklet includes photographs, translations of lyrics, and background.

This studio recording, done in Ludwigsburg, Germany, at some time in the 1980s before Nikhil Banerjee's death in 1986, provides three nice but short examples of his artistry: a morning rag combination of rag Nat and popular rag Bhairav in 16-beat teental; a light classical, romantic piece on khamaj with scale sampling freedom [mishra] and 7-beat rupaktal; and an encore folk melody from the mystic Bauls of Bengal. Banerjee trained under the guidance of Allaudhin Khan and his son Ali Akbar Khan; thus he has much of the depth and improvisational variation of these supreme masters of North Indian music. Although I prefer longer recordings of rags that allow more extensive development of the alap, the first movement, this album is still very worthy. There are a comparatively small number of recordings of this brilliant sitarist; each album gives us an appreciation of his art and what we have missed by his early passing.

This four person music ensemble of mandolin and guitar, flute and whistle, bagpipes and clarinet, melodeon, harmonica, and fiddle play a variety of tunes. They venture into Celtic, Swedish, and outer Baltic waters. It is difficult to predict where they visit as track follows track, with some fiddle tunes, some polkas, mazurkas, waltzes, a psalm, and an odd ball here and there. These are excellent musicians with wit. A very nice album. [The accordionist, Kimmo Pohjonen, by the way, is the co-composer of the album Uniko, with the Kronos Quartet performing.]

With her latest album, Belezas, presently being played on my local jazz station, I browsed her previous works, including this album. I had not before heard this award-winning Brazilian vocalist, and I am much pleased to acquire Bossa Nova and her later live album with her father, Antonio Adolfo, whose talents include piano, composition and arrangements, and band leader. With 13 tracks spanning some 54 minutes, this particular album does not cover the old familiar classic bossa nova hits but, instead, other compositions by Tom Jobim, Joo Donato, Baden Powell, and Doraval Caymmi, with additional works by Djavan, Aloysio de Oliveira, Roberto Menescal, and Koichi Sugiyama (track 9). The arrangements (from Ricardo Silveira and Luiz Avellar), including strings, provide a lush, comfortable jazz sound. Saboya's soprano is clear and mellow. This beautiful album demonstrates why, after a decade of developing her style and recording in Brazil and Japan, she has come to the United States again (previously as a music student), now as a well-established and rising star.

Funk, blues, soul, bebop, gospel: these ingredients stewing in the caldron of the relaxed southern California club, The Lighthouse, provided a lavish meal of jazz. The engineers then and afterwards knew what they were doing because the sound is outstanding: I am there NOW, not in 1960. A live recording is always a gamble, as there is often one opportunity to get it right. These musicians got it right. Remarkably, I can envision Cannonball Adderly smiling as he introduces the tunes. Victor Feldman's brilliant piano work captivates, and his Azule Serape has over the years warmed my ears. This quintet of major individual artists play as a unit organism. As the last track indicates, the recording is Our Delight.

Ni&ntilde;a Pastori issued this album in 2000. Since then, she has moved further toward the pop side of popular flamenco and has twice received the Latin Grammy. If your preference is traditional flamenco, as I, then this transitional album may be of interest. Indeed, she opens with a traditionally arranged buler&iacute;a, and the album also includes tangos, rumba, and allegr&iacute;as. She has the typical rough or "strained" voice of flamenco cantaors. She and her fellow artists of this vibrant contemporary style, such as Diego el Cigala, have expanded the world audience of flamenco. As with jazz vocalists, success is attained with believability, a sensitivity to the lyrics. Pastori has been honored because she has this ability to convey the lyrics beyond the ear to the heart. The insert contains the lyrics in Spanish. The album is short, which is not unusual for flamenco musicians, lasting some 38 minutes.

This 1997 remastered anthology of flamenco spans recordings of older artists, such as Peral de Cadiz [1925-1975], Manolo Caracol [1909-1973], and Terremoto de Jerez [1936-1981], to contemporary musicians of note, including Carmen Linaresa, Enrique Morente, and Gabriel Moreno. Most of the selections, all cante, are the more light-hearted or festive alegr&iacute;a, buler&iacute;a, caracole, tiento, and fandango; however, emotionally deeper and slower styles are also represented: siguirya, sol&eacute;a, and taranta. Flamenco-inspired songs--villancico, campanillero, and nana (originally a lullaby)--are present. Often an anthology will include a track that could be considered ho-hum or an oddball, and track 14 comes as a shock, with its loud, bright electronics and contemporary arrangement following the long series of acoustic traditional forms. The final track is of Colombian origin. Thus, the album provides a wide survey of palo and artistic styles. The collection is also worthy by featuring a number of musicians whose recordings are otherwise not readily available.

The plot of the movie itself was a trivial and obvious excuse of a skeleton on which to superimpose some grand flamanco and Arabo fusions. This soundtrack, while a remembrance of that movie, can stand alone. After all, we can hear flamenco nuevo guitarist Tomatito and also singer La Paquera de Jerez with guitar accompaniment of another esteemed artist, El Parrillo de Jerez. One of the strangest combinations is Sheikh al-Tuni, a charismatic Sufi singer from upper Egypt, with Tomatito and respective ensembles. It would have made more sense to have a Moroccan Sufi singer, as both regions are Andalusia and share common heritage. The track, longest of the album, is more Egyptian than Spanish. Two other tracks are Arabic music, which underline the influence of Arabo-Sefarad music in the development of flamenco. We also hear a throw-away techno-pop rendition, which in the film was appropriate to a sex club. Other artists include Ramon and Emilio Fernandez de los Santos of Gritos de Guerra, Grupo Jos&eacute;, the Turkish ney player Kudsi Erguner, and singers Remedios Silva Pisa and La Caita.Track 13 may seem odd, the tree with duende, but in the movie is the most memorable scene for me. Think of the tree as metaphor, whose roots reach deep. The theme, Naci en Alamo, is composed by the Greek musician Dionysis Tsaknis.In short, this album is rather international,. When we hear unadorned flamenco, it is raw and heart-felt. Otherwise, the arabo-flamenco fusions and popular tunes are pleasant and interesting.

Long alpine horns, lutes, ocarinas, flutes, jew's harps, upright fiddles: this wide assortment of musical instruments makes Kyrigyzstan unique on the Silk Road. Its smooth musical tone and sweet melodies are also special. Like the group Tengir-Too, the Kamarkan Folk Ensemble are touring musical ambassadors of a nation that became independent after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. This recording was made in London in 2001. [Amazon states two discs but it actually is one.] The album includes a booklet with color photographs of the land, its peoples, the musicians, and their instruments. Lyrics are also provided.The music is varied, only suggested by the various instruments, and listening is a treat. The quality of sound is slightly inferior to the Smithsonian Folkways recording of Tengir-Too, and although the musical selections are similar, the two albums do not overlap.

A 1992 Capitol/World Pacific compilation of two albums from 1978 and 1980, when Djavan was establishing his songwriting and singing career, this CD offers, besides the music itself, titles, collaborating composer, track timing, and one-line synopsis of each song. That is it. No information about musicians and the usual production credits. Those interested can dig this missing information from internet sources. Meanwhile, the music of the young pop and samba vocalist will suffice. And how it satisfies! We can imagine when 30 years ago these albums first appeared. Here was a new singer, a soulful voice, to capture youth and adult alike. With his own sound and distinct compositions, Djavan already was open to American and European pop and rock influences while firmly rooted in Brazilian traditions. The music remarkably is not dated. There is no era-stamp on it. The tracks vary in tempo and arrangements, maintaining interest throughout with songs of celebration, songs of sadness and regret, dances and ballads. The second album is somewhat stronger, as can be expected, but Alumbramento is still very good. I much enjoy these timeless classics, so filled with emotion.

This large group of thirteen folk musicians and singers are Egyptian Romanies, or gypsies, who travel along the Nile to perform at weddings, festivals, and Muslim rites, which is to say the traditional and historic role of itinerate musicians and minstrels. Their songs here are of romance and longing. Their instruments are dominated by unique double-tubed instruments of single reed (the magrouna) and double reeds (the mazmar), plus a rebab fiddle, frame drums (the duff), a sort of hour-glass shaped brass drum (the doholla), and the similar but ceramic Egyptian tabla or dumbek. Their music is intense, joyful, and rhythmic, hence supportive of dance and celebration. This is music of the village.

Thailand, Burma, and Indonesia are not normally considered when speaking of the Silk Road, and Japan and Korea are regarded as only Eastern extensions to the Chinese hub. However, marine shortcuts around the Indian Ocean to the Near East were historic but more hazardous alternatives to the typical caravan routes across Central Asia; thus, we can give license to the title of this splendid illustrated edition to the exhibit, Sounds of the Silk Road. The couple of illustrated encyclopedias of musical instruments mainly depend on drawings, but this book is of beautiful colored photographs of the instruments within the collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and it includes views of details and historic artistic depictions of the instruments from the various lands. The full history of the evolution, variation, and spread of musical instruments across the Silk Road is yet to be discerned and popularly presented. This book indicates how rich a history it would be; meanwhile, we can appreciate the fine art and craft involved in their design and production. This a wonderful book of treasures that would delight any musician or fan of world music.

Modern classical composer Michael Torke established himself with his rhythmic colored music [Rust; Green; Ecstatic Orange; Bright Blue Music, etc.], brief works often put to dance. Jennifer Higdon tackled colors in this album, too, with her Pale Yellow and Fiery Red for piano trio. Music and art have a close bond, and the moods and association of hues are expressed in such compositions. Higdon's works are strongly melodic and architectural; as poetic scaffolding, they have rhythm and shape and texture. Likewise, the patterns of her Voices are readily apprehended: the frantic, wild Blitz; the quieter, glimmering, and pulsing Soft Enlacing; the contemplative and accepting Grace. Art and music once again is the theme in the third work, a quartet of four movements. Indeed, her Impressions refers directly to both Monet and his contemporaries as well as to the quartets of Ravel and Debussy. We can almost sense the light and shadow, the quick but confident brush strokes, or the shimmering, gentleness, and flowing of notes. The track To The Point is said to refer to the pointillism of Seurat (actually a post-Impressionist) as well as to the rapid, short metallophone notes of the Indonesian gamelan at the 1889 World Exhibition that so impressed Ravel. The accomplished musicians perform these compositions beautifully. This is an excellent, indeed, exciting album.

Acoustic guitar and soprano duos in Brazilian music are a winning combination. After listing to Luciana Souza singing respectively with guitarists, Romero Lubambo, Marco Pereira, and Walter Santos (her father), I felt there was too much guitar bravado and did not groove on her stylized jazz voice. Something was missing. I needed to hear this earlier album of Wanda S&aacute; and Roberto Menescal. S&aacute; desired simplicity and informality in this recording and the result is splendid. There is joy and happiness in her voice. Menescal's occasional singing applies harmonic accentuation and mellowness. It is as if listening to a jam in a corner of some studio, the artists entertaining themselves with great bossa nova tunes. The supporting percussion is unobtrusive. If you like your bossa nova relaxed and pure, this album will delight you.

This transformation of jazz trio to string orchestra takes Steve Kuhn, his piano, and his compositions into Hollywood. ECM recordings of free jazz characteristically border contemporary classical, but this album walks the edge of jazz and at times may have crossed over entirely. The lush, lyrical, emotional and dramatic pieces seem to be a soundtrack from a romantic movie of the 1970s. The listener can easily create the scenes from its dark, menacing opening to a passionate epic, of a dance, a drive in the country, misgivings, departures, a waltz to the bed, a wistful, nostalgic lament on the path not taken, acceptance, resolution, and bittersweet memories of the journey. Seriously. Kuhn has a flair of the drama in all his works. The contrast between the same tunes by trio and by strings could not be stronger. The wandering improvisations and rhythms of the trio are lost, or made less obvious here, though the score for strings do shift our emotions here and then there. Each track is an interesting scene, with sensitive, developing piano work, but taken together they develop a tedium of sameness in their largely even and moderate tempo and sound. As a jazz recording, I find fault, but as a cinematic soundtrack it deserves full marks. This is a remarkable, unusual sound adventure. Kuhn's and Carlos Franzetti's orchestral score is impressive writing.

Aside from the classical choros of Villa-Lobos, the anthologies of mandolin maestro Jacob do Bandolim introduced me to this early musical form of Brazil. A fusion of Brazilian folk melodies, African rhythm, and European dance styles, it enjoyed popularity in late 19th- and early 20th-centuries. Perhaps more so than the samba, which soon followed, the choro is happy or sweet music. A choro ensemble consists of a somewhat standard grouping of instruments, namely, a 7-string guitar, providing bass notes; a 6-string guitar; the tamborine-like pandeiro; a solo instrument, which could be a mandolin, saxophone, or, here, a flute; and a cavaquinho, which is similar to a ukelele but not included with this quartet of musicians, Groupo Choro Rasgado. However, this album includes additional instruments, depending of tune: on one track the group is supplemented with a classical string quartet; another track has an accordion; yet another track includes a bass; and the final tune includes piano, tambourin, and the cavquinho. Compositions and arrangements are new, and there is a feeling of airiness and lightness created by the rapid staccato notes of the flute. At times, like traditional New Orleans jazz, the guitarists weave their improvisations with flute. The soft pandeiro provides a bouncy rhythm. Some have compared choros to American ragtime, which shared the same era, because of its cheerful and speedy melodies. The fan of Brazilian music will find this album truly enjoyable. More than a historical link to the samba, the choro is simply fun. This album, among the very few choro recordings available, is well performed, nicely engineered, and as fresh and warm as tropical breeze.

After obtaining several albums from early L&uacute;nasa, I wanted more, and the dual of Michael McGoldrick, their flute, whistle, and uillean pipe man, with John McSherry, another piper, backed by other musicians on guitar, fiddle, bass, keyboards, and bouzouki, provide us a jaunty journey to Ireland. The happy spirit, the uplifting lilts, a popular style in arrangements, and professionalism throughout, give this album great joy. I am a sucker for the uilleann pipes anyway. Thus, if you delighted in the instrumentals and spunk of L&uacute;nasa in its Green Linnet days, then you will certainly appreciate this recording. Nay, you will get up to dance and skip to it!

Sometimes I think that the art of conversation, wide in scope and deep in insights, is in decline among the youth. I was pleased to watch these two senior literary chaps, who contrast physically and in style, discuss society, the state of the planet, deep ecology, Asian culture, history of the Beats -- particularly Ginsberg -- and living away from the din of cities in the Sierras. The reading of poems that often hit home was an important addition, as it is always worthy to hear the poet's own phrasings and rhythm, as listening to a composer conducting her own symphonies. The documentary weaves its segments, painting rather than photographing its subject. I have some of Snyder's books and am a Zen practitioner myself; thus, I was already sympathetic to the poet and his worldview. Others, perhaps, may focus on his environmental concerns and lifestyle or on biographical and historical matters. Snyder's categorical distinctions of "nature", "wild", and "wilderness" are important. Snyder himself, like Pete Seeger, seem indefatigable, suggesting that the vigors of mountain living and maintaing intellectual curiosity are conducive to health. There is much to enjoy in this film. Only under an hour in length, you will wish that it would be longer. The title comes from a 1990 collection of Snyder's essays.

To review and appraise this album, some comparison with similar recordings would be helpful. I have four albums of Persian mystical poets sung by Shahram Nazeri and Mohammad Rez Shajarian, supported by different groups of musicians, including the Dastan Ensemble, and a very contemporary, electronic enhanced album by Sussan Deyhim. I also have two recordings of Zohreh Jooya singing Afghani music. How then does this particular album measure up? First, the liner notes are excellent, providing background information on Sufism, the poets, the poems sung, and the musicians, with many photographs. Second, the musicians playing traditional tar, oud, setar, ney, tabla, and daf are also very good, especially Madjid Derakhshani, who also composed and arranged the music and who at time sings and narrates. The recordings include cello and saxophone and electronic special effects (such as a pseudo chamber for depth echoes and wind). The compositions themselves have passion and profundity and are impressive, indeed beautiful. Jooya, however, sings rather straight forward. She lacks the emotional strength and interpretative passion that convey the struggles, the fears, the bliss described in the poetry. In short, she does not "sell" or transmit the songs, at least to my ears and background, but she sings well. Considered in totality, her singing is enhanced by the instrumental arrangements. The album is certainly worthwhile. It is powerful in effect, and there is much to enjoy and to feel. ****1/2.

This album, among world jazz guitarist Nguyn L's earliest, honors his roots. Though born in Paris and not versed in Vietnamese language or much of the culture, his immigrant mother sang the traditional folk songs that are the basis of most of these tracks. The vocalist is Huong Thanh, and she sings with support of both Vietnamese instruments (dan tranh, dan bau, sao, sapek, dan nguy&eacute;t) and Western trumpet, flugelhorn, saxophone, bass, marimba, piano, drums, and L's various guitars. The international musicians have produced a fascinating Vietnamese jazz synthesis. The Vietnamese sound is probably new and somewhat exotic to younger generations, but the jazz improvisations should be more widely appreciated. Track 5, with a fretless guitar and the tabla of Trilok Gurtu, is a brief detour to India on the way to the mountain Hmong of Vietnam. In L's later albums, his guitar work would often mimic the dan tranh zither, keeping Vietnam within his various European and world jazz ensembles. This delightful album should open the ears of many world music and jazz fans.

This very fine album of classical violin and piano chamber music is unusual in that while it contains the works of a single composer, they are richly variable in musical styles. Moreover, the musicians, highly accomplished, well-recorded and internationally lauded, perform with both tenderness and technical precision. The result is pleasurable listening; it is also an education. Szymanowski wrote his works at the end of the Romantic period, through the rise of Impressionism, and the later novel explorations of time and folkloric themes. The selections here cover these periods.The fully developed, emotionally strong, lyrical Violin Sonata is from 1904. Its romantic sweetness has a nostalgic feeling. The second movement is marked by pizzicato. The representative of 1910 is the brief Romance, a dramatic and luxuriant work with crescendos and a final long exhale in the upper register, rising to the sky. The 1915 composition, Mythes, brought Szymanowski high regard. Influenced by Debussy, the three sections are atmospheric with touches of folkoric dance. It is as if hearing rites through a mist. Another piece from this year has two parts, indicated by its title, Notturno and Tarantella. It opens with darkness and mystery. Sketches of exotic melodies expand into an Arabian Night before fading back into somber stillness. True to its title, the tarantella is a bright skittering, demonic dance, nervous and fervent. Two late period pieces are presented: Berceuse d'Atacho Enia of 1925 and a transcription of the Chant de Roxane from the opera King Roger. The first is a lullaby of unease; the second, a slow, gentle seductive flowing. Miriam Kramer, violin, is convincing in all her parts, and her piano accompanist Nicholas Durcan brings enhancing support. This is a thoroughly delightful album.

Trios in classical music consist of piano, violin, and cello. The jazz trio is typically piano, drums, and bass. The piano's wide sonic range is key, but Triology has two violins and cello....and the combination works beautifully. Like the Kronos Quartet, this group has spunk and is inventive in its interpretations. The album takes on Ennio Morricone's film scores from Spaghetti Westerns, gangster noirs, and a romantic adventure. The great variety of arrangements and moods provides a listening adventure as they move from jazz club to classical salon to a midnight tavern to desert landscape. This is a fun recording by superb musicians who produce a synergy of sound.

Kabuki developed from noh plays and bunraku puppet theatre. Hence, the actors do not always speak but act out and sometimes dance the narratives of a musical ensemble at the side of the stage. If you want the hear the short percussive accents and dances of Kabuki, this CD will not meet your expectations, and I recommend instead Ensemble Nipponia's very fine album on Nonesuch. Nagauta, the form of long narrative songs sometimes presented in concert separate from kabuki, is the focus here of Ensemble Kineya. The group plays shamisen lute, the nokan and shinobue flutes, the shoulder drum ko-tsuzumi, the hip drum o-tsuzumi, and the more familiar stick drum or taiko. The performance of three pieces is finely recorded. I have seen three full kabuki performances [a live recording of the drama Kanjincho is no longer available (King Records, Japan, KICH 2003)] and can thereby state that this CD does provide the flavor of kabuki with the alternating single narrator, with one shamisen and drum or flute, followed by the chorus of the full ensemble. Yet without the movement of actors, the color of costumes, and the rich backdrops, the music is but a shadow of the kabuki experience.

With the 1990 Musicmaster recordings with Dennis Russell Davies no longer available, this album of Copland's abstract chamber works from the late 1920s to early 1950s is a splendid introduction to his less popular, more classical compositions. Indeed, the addition of a second disc provides a greater exploration. The album is an Amazon CD-R and like its ilk, liner notes or insert are lacking. Indeed, you would have no idea that this 2006 Arabesque Recording includes the following musicians from Copland House: Derek Bermel, clarinet; Michael Boriskin, piano; Paul Lustig Dunkel, flute; Nicolas Kitchen, violin; and Wilhelmina Smith, cello. Thus, with a first-rate ensemble residing in Copland's own home, we could expect a proper and worthy recording; and it is. These are chamber pieces, but you will still hear a jazzy tempo (in Ukulele Sernade and the first movement of the Sextet) and a folkloric tune (in the piano-percussive Vitebsky). On the other hand, the piano quartet is a 12-tone composition. For more chamber pieces, listen to his Complete Music for Solo Piano [e.g., Leo Smit/Sony]. Despite all the various abstract, often stringent pieces, the Americana Copland is just below the surface, as his beautiful, lyrical Sonata for Violin and Piano indicates. This album is for all Copland fans and collectors of 20th-century American classical music.

With clay goblet drums and clapping as percussion, this group of women singers from Sudan provide some traditional, somewhat hypnotic music. Despite the variation in rhythms, there is a sameness in tempo and sound across the 11 tracks, lasting over an hour (with the expection of track 5, Al Ajiko, which follows a strong Arabian rhythmic pattern), but this supports the dance-trance effect. Individually, the songs and dances are of praise, romance, and devotion. Songs follow the call-and-response style. Such songs and dances among women are often associated with weddings. Some people may become bored with the album, but I personally find it both interesting and cheerful. [Advice: the recording is still available through other sources, including ARC Records, at a significantly lower price.]

Most folks purchase the "Best of..." album, and in doing so they miss these other, more varied and core tunes. The album title is of interest because, as Elijah Wald pointed out his history of early blues, the blues was at first not called that. It was a time of rags and even if we recognized the 12-bar blues, they were at first called a rag or a reel. John Handy and Ma Rainey's music referred to the emotion rather than a style, but the association of emotion and musical style took root. The sound quality here is very fine considering the source material from 1929 and 1930. The insert notes give detailed description of each track. Patton had three guest artists on some tracks: Henry Sims, fiddle; Willie Brown, guitar; Bertha Lee, vocals. While Southern Black vaudeville artists were belting out blues-like popular tunes, the release of earthy, country tunes by Patton caused a sensation and he, too, became popular, creating a niche in the early record industry and influencing other Delta musicians. This album is worthy for any student of the early blues.

Issued at the end of 2006 was Miguel Poveda's album "Tierra de Calma"; this present album, an on-demand CD ROM version at discounted price, suffers only by the absence of liner notes. What you do get is an outstanding modern flamenco recording with guitarist Juan Carlos Romero and the deep interpretive cante of Poveda. Perhaps Poveda's most mature recording, it has less razzle dazzle, involves minimal instrumental support, but places greater emphasis on the lyrics. As in his first album, "Suena Flamenco," he introduces on one track the piano to establish a novel classical art/cabaret format. Compared to his earlier, more extroverted albums, the slower songs of "Tierra de Calma" are for late night contemplation. Miguel Poveda has won awards early in his career and after a decade of developing his art, he has become a powerful voice for contemporary serious flamenco. This is a great album.

A notorious rule in art seems that the sequel is inferior to the original, be it movies, paintings, and recordings. Not so for this anthology; indeed, it is better than Volume 1 of Great Voices of Fado. But it is hard to state why. Perhaps it is simply the selection of songs but more probable is the different group of artists. (Both albums contain selections by the great old style singers Am&aacute;lia Rodrigues, of course, and Joo Braga, and also the contemporary singer B&eacute;vinda.) The mix of male and female vocalists provide nice balance. The liner notes include biographical sketches of the 13 singers. Anthologies are an excellent way to appreciate the range of fado and discover particular artists. Musically, the pieces are mellow with touches of melancholy and nostalgia, as usual. Cristina Branco's pure soprano rendition of "Saudade" especially tugs at the heart, and the romantic ballad by baritone Jos&eacute; Manuel Barreto demonstrates why he became a popular nightclub star. A fine album for dinner and afterwards.

Michael Torke is renown for his bright cheerful, positive compositions. He must be a happy, optimistic person. Almost all of his works, or sections of large pieces, are short, some 5 to 15 minutes. They have been adapted for the dance, as encores, as theatrical interludes. They are episodic in mood. Many have the percussive pulse akin to those of Steve Reich. There is little development and emotional shifting, except when taken in a series, as in a concerto. This particular album, number 3 of his own reissues from the defunk Decca ARGO label, includes works from 1993 to 1996. It begins with Javelin, which is full of excitement, energy and movement. It is followed by a lyrical, light but sometimes reflectively thoughtful saxophone concerto. December, the next composition, which by title connotes winter and somberness, does have its quieter moments but begins with speed and intensity as an approaching storm. Run, like Javelin, is about energy and flow; it begins with a fanfare of sorts and then, well, runs to the finish line. The last work, another of Torke's color series, is Charcoal and one prepared specifically for ballet and thus richer and somewhat more complex within its merely six minutes. It is angular and percussive with drums and staccato with reeds and brass. Torke seems to be less effective in very prolonged, nonepisodic compositions, but I am happy with his vignettes. Torke named his record firm, Ecstatic [referringto his piece Ecstatic Orange]; you too will find joy in this album.

Sequels typically do not match the quality of the original, but this second anthology of early recordings does not suffer greatly the same fate because most of the artists are the same. On the positive side, it includes selections of major cantaors La Paquera de Jerez, Camar&oacute;n de la Isla, Terremoto de Jerez, and Rafael Farina and the guitar stylings of Manolo Labrador. Two tracks (an alegria and a buler&iacute;a) of Grupo Gitano del Sacromonte give us the sound of dance, spice to the compilation. On the negative side, for me, are two pieces each from the overrated but historically important Manitas de Plata and the peculiar high voiced Pepe Nu&ntilde;ez "El Lore&ntilde;o" and one weak track from Juan Torres "El Ciclon de Jerez". Other tracks are from lesser lights but nonetheless fine singers Manuel Jim&eacute;nez Rejano and Ram&oacute;n "El Portugu&eacute;s" Su&aacute;rez Salazar. Together, the anthology does provide a good taste of mid twentieth-century flamenco, where so few are available.

Having more familiarity with the classical instrumental music of Afghanistan performed by soloists, I must reply on comparison with the successful CD, Radio Kabul, for large ensemble music. That recording is some 20 minutes longer and encompasses a variety of musical forms, both darker and more subdued classical instrumentas and joyous popular songs, and the musicianship is very fine. In this CD, Zohreh Jooya's voice is remarkably smooth and lovely, and Hamid Golestani's excellent baritone is a nice contrast in the series of tracks. The overall recording of songs, including ghazals and qawwalis, is light and spirited and more uniform in tone. It is happy and sometimes danceable. There is perhaps too much harmonium, but the rubab and various drums support the ensemble well. My actual rating is 4.5 stars.

New to Ivan Lins (though I heard his songs covered by other vocalists), I found this award-winning 2004 live-concert album as arresting and as refreshing as a splash of Rio's ocean. I love his voice, which takes me back to the early days of American-discovered bossa nova, the gentle liquid sounds of Gilberto and Jobim. But there is more to these recordings than the voice; the rich musical arrangements and large supporting band and singers are cheerful, broad, and effective. Lins' sweet Brazilian Portuguese modulations and the harmonious swaying ballads are interspersed with more percussive and uplifting pieces. Lyrics are provided in Portuguese. 16 tracks over 66 minutes present beautiful, relaxing, and popular Brazilian jazz at an exciting live venue.

Having recently heard the San Francisco Symphony perform this symphony and realizing that I did not have it in my collection, I chose this Hickox and the London Symphony Orchestra recording for its high quality engineering and additional choral compositions. I was not disappointed. Symphony 4 has been compared in structure and its shock-and-awe effect with Beethoven's Symphony 5: after Vaughan Williams' lyrical and majestic Sea, London, and Pastoral Symphonies, this composition was strikingly complex and brazen. An orchestra can easily go awry with over and under emphases of sections. Hickox achieves perfect balance within and throughout the work and brings added cohesion. SFO was good, but this recording of the LSO is great. Moreover, the sound was crystal clear and the SACD surround sound was well balanced, although I felt the orchestra a little too distant for my taste. I especially enjoyed the bonus of the mass, with one foot in the Renaissance, and six brief but lovely songs, the latter based on poems of Shelly. If you have never heard this symphony and are familiar with Vaughan Williams mainly from his gentle Lark and London Symphony, discover his other side with this excellent album.

Imagine carnival in Brazil in the early years of the 20th century. Did you think of the powerful drum rhythms of samba? Think again. Carnival bands played fox trots and country music! Popular dances from Cuba and even the United State had stronger influence than indigenous music. While the Brazil white artistocracy and elite looked to Europe for music and style, lower socio-economic groups, Blacks, and artistic and literary bohemians sought the beat and guitar innovations arising from old Moorish Iberia coupled with choro string bands and the Afro-Brazilian Candombl&eacute; religious rites. How the samba and its particular rhythmic pattern developed and moved into popular and then national importance is the topic of this book, based on a doctoral dissertation and thus filled with vast detail and arcane cultural knowledge. Reading this history, it was impossible not to think about the American adoptation of Black southern jazz into the mainstream, particularly during the 1930s and lasting until the shift to rock and roll, and to consider the differences in the experience of these two nations. Race and the stigma of mixtures figured in both, but in Brazil the high frequency of racial mixing took on a cultural unifying metaphor.The samba was the urban sound of shanty Rio de Janiero. With the advent of radio headquartered in Rio, music of popular samba bands reached Pernambuco, Bahia, and Santa Catarina in the same way novel big band sounds in New York City were heard in Iowa, Texas, and California. The record industry took advantage of rising interest in samba and helped nationalize this music. One of the more interesting facts in this book was that Carmen Miranda, who in America was the living symbol of Brazil, was actually Portuguese, never held an Brazilian passport, and adopted the costume, dance moves, and music of Afro-Brazilians in Bahia. She was not appreciated by elite critics in Brazil; and only in recent years has her contribution been honored. The book closes with some discussion on bossa nova and tropicalismo. The dryness of the scholarly author's prose can be contrasted with the journalistic verve of Ruy Castro in his book on bossa nova. Although most of characters and historical details presented in Vianna's book were quickly forgotten, I did take home the essence of samba's importance and popularity in Brazilian culture and ethos. For that, this small book is worthwhile.

Only four stars. Why? Because, oh dear, I cannot get the raw, brilliant interpretations of Alabama Song by The Doors and the classic theatrical renditions of Threepenny Opera, Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, and the Seven Deadly Sins out of my head. Dee Dee Bridgewater fortunately mainly sings the American Kurt Weill, whose lush popular ballads are equally etched. The highlight of this album for me is Bilbao Song, with its Spanish and Latin arrangement (and dandy lyrics). Speak Low and and September Song are also nicely accomplished, though My Ship lacks the gravitas that, for instance, George Shearing rendered on his solo piano. Bridgewater's voice is smooth and silky, which works well for some but not all songs. Weill can be sentimental but also acerbic and wry. It is difficult for a single artist to capture this wide range, and her version of Alabama Song was, for me, just awful, actually painful. The unlisted Mack the Knife, a continuation of final track 11, is up-tempo as Bobby Darrin's style, and it is done as a comical vamp. Yes, this is a jazz album, but the artist should convey the lyrics (think Sinatra) and I am not sold. Still, it is a valiant attempt, and the collection of Weill's great songs is very nice to hear in one place.

Jessica Williams has had various side men over the decades. In 1999, she had the support of Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. Together they made a delightful recording that had received praise at the time. The rhythm section takes only a supporting role, remaining unobtrusive in the background but pushing the blues forward. The album still holds up as one of William's better albums, consistent in its musicianship with an interesting selection of romantic covers and original tunes. I particularly appreciate her composition Mr. Johnson as an excellent example of her art. Williams at the time liked to mix many arpeggios with chords, and as she had a bass, she focused on the treble, but in this piece, all musicians and all elements are in perfect dynamic balance with no runs and with emphasis on the notes of the dark blues, minor/major transitions, and strong rhythms. The CD, originally on William's own Red & Blue records, is now available on Jazz Focus.

After co-founding and working with the Irish folk group Solas, brilliant guitarist John Doyle ventures into a career as soloist with this debut album. Compared to his subsequent smoothly polished solo album, Wayward Son, this recording is direct and raw, energetic and strong. Doyle is assisted on some tracks by Liz Carroll's fiddle, Liz Knowles' fiddle, Michael Aharon's piano and bass and cello, John Anthony's percussion, Richie Stearns' banjo, Kieran O'Hare pipes, John Williams' concertina and whistle, and Karen Casey's voice. The tunes are traditional but arranged by Doyle. Against the sharply powerful picking and strumming of guitar is his dignified and gentle voice. Lyrics and notes are provided in the enclosed booklet. Four tracks are instrumentals, including reels and jigs to get your heart pounding and feet amoving. This is a solid traditional Irish folk music album without frills. But there are thrills, as the musicianship is gripping.

When I listened to a recording of Dine and Kiowa peyote songs, one, said to be sung in the Caddo style, was indeed different. Hence, I obtained this album of Caddo ceremonial and dance music to learn more about this softer style with much repeated phrasing, sometime stop-and-go drumming, varying rhythms and with drum tremolos and flourishes. The Caddo, I found, were met by DeSoto in 1541, that the tribe, then located near the Red River of Texas and now situated in Oklahoma, were agrarian traders but eventually took to hunting after acquiring horses. This recording, made in 1975, presents seven men playing drum and singing. The original issue of 2 LPs are now on CD for 72 minutes duration. These are wonderful melodies, and the varying rhythmic patterns of dances keep the listener's interest. As traditional music is important in preserving a cultural heritage, the Caddo have much to rejoice in their fine dance music.

Some years ago, I rid my collection of bland New Age electronica. This wonderful album survived the purge because this classic recording borders on avant-garde classical with its rhythms, electronic invention, and well-developed compositions. So otherworldly in its beginning, I once used the track Nucleotide in a multi-media lecture. That the album is still available after these many years validates its significance. The recording is under 38 minutes in duration, shocking little use of the CD format, but it is still worth it. If you tend to shy away from New Age electronica (with justification), or have an interest in Morton Subotnick and other electronic classical music pioneers, do consider listening to this album.

Many recordings of Japanese shaukaushi bamboo flute are available; thus I was surprised to find Masayuki Koga's album Eastwind still being produced. But then, there is a very good reason: it is a great album of both traditional and his own contemporary pieces. One must be highly talented and inventive to do both well; Koga is a master. The sound quality of the album, a remastered anthology of his LPs, is excellent, owing to the original studio engineering and the sense of chamber depth. The use of rice paper in package design is a nice touch. The classic pieces--Distant Cry of Deer, Sashi no Kyolu, Rokudan, and Zangetsu--are unforgiving; any flaw in breathing technique, sensitivity, and rhythmic flow is readily apparent. Koga, who was trained in both the Kinko and Tozan schools of shakuhashi, performs these works in grand style. His own works maintain the traditional sound but with modern flair in phrasing. One track is a duet with koto. Such slow music produces timelessness, tranquility, and awareness. Koga is a musical sorcerer.

Long ago,I purchased this recording, the first of my digeridoo albums, because of its blend of electronic atmospherics and New Age/Ancient deep guttural traditional sound of the digeridoo and spirit catcher whirligig. It was among the first albums for David Hudson, who has made a major career playing the digeridoo. Since then, I have largely avoided mushy New Age electronica and prefer acoustic traditional instruments. Relistening to the recording, I find that it may serve well as a movie soundtrack but does not stand up alone because of the inconsistency and fuzzy ambience. It is best when Hudson plays solo, though track 5, The Initiation, when all three musicians perform, is very powerful. The earthiness and romantic sound of an ancient people make the album worthwhile, and it is significant by leading the way for more focused digeridoo albums. That it is still available indicates that it was among the better experimental fusions of the era.

A soundtrack to a documentary, this album nevertheless is able to stand alone. Ottoman themes, Turkish instruments, strong drum rhythms, a wide variety of sounds from ney flute, tanbur, baglama, and guitar lutes, rabab spiked fiddle, and zither, and vocals provide a richly ornamented Oriental tapestry. Brian Keane's occasional synthesizers do not distract and provide a harmonic drone. Most of the brief tracks together create an atmosphere. Some pieces are dances; others are formal works in traditional modes, still others are traditional folk tunes. At the end, we feel as if we spent a day in an Istanbul bazaar, fragrant with spices and hookah smoke, luxuriant in colorful clothing and glistening metallic wares, and in the distance the courtyard of the Caliph, with its echoing music beckoning us forward. Yes, this album is a journey.

Fire--its warmth, its light, and its purifying properties--has long been symbolic among all humanity for spirituality, intelligence, and reason. This album honors fire. It is the follow-up to Silverbird's 1992 issue, The Blessing Way. I regard it superior by the greater variety of tunes through more vocal chant and percussion (drum, rattle). Its 48 minutes and 18 short tracks--four under one minute, each a peace pipe prayer to a great compass direction--is peaceful and often sublime. Subtle environmental sounds, such as crickets, birds, and distant thunder, add to the depth. It is worthy to note that the album was produced by New Age electronica artist Steve Roach and issued by Celestial Harmonies, a label specializing in spiritual and traditional ethnomusicological recordings, as the Music of Islam, of Vietnam, and of Cambodia series. Silverbird's flute playing is sensitive and soft and his voice is very pleasant. Track 13, Emptiness, is indeed a letting go and the breathy Indian flute sound suggests the Japanese shakuhachi, associated with Zen Buddhism. Two tracks, vocal and instrumental, honor his wife and they are indeed sweet. Other tracks have lovely, simple, elegantly plain melodies, all performed with joy or respect. Only the final track involves the pow-wow drum and extra dubbing and mixing for added effect. While out of character with the previous pieces, it serves as a final statement.

When Hakim, Amr Diab, and other popular stars of Egyptian music permeate the region with loud electric guitars and saxophones, it is good to rest the ears on classical styles. Egypt has various categories of musical styles and associated ensembles: the madh musicians of Sufism and the folk mizmar ensembles for weddings and festivals, for instance. In the late 19th century arose music regarded as art, now classical music, played by takht ensembles with a small set of instruments, a nay flute, a qanun zither, an oud lute, and a riqq drum. Sometimes, as in this recording, other percussion are included, duff frame and tabalah goblet drums. By the early twentieth century, Western violins, cellos, and other instruments entered the ensembles, which became full orchestras, and popular, long songs were developed. (Think of Oum Kouthoum.) Classical music employs suites and improvisations usually based on single maqam modes, a tradition that goes far back to Islamic Spain.This recording, the first of 15 volumes of the outstanding Music of Islam series, send us back a century to purely instrumental art or chamber ensembles, but one with modern sensitivies and approaches. This is readily apparent with the percussion solos. It is not belly-dancing music, even though some of the rhythms lend itself to dancing. Over all, it provides a core introduction to Arabic music, as Egypt has long been the center of the Arab musical world with its recording studios and radio broadcasts. And the particular selections and the musicians are first-rate. This album is very fine indeed.

There is melancholy and a depth of passion in Armenian music, be it folk music or, here, in music of the church. David Parsons and Celestial Harmonies have given us remarkable series of world music: Vietnam, Cambodia, and the spectrum of music within Islam. These recordings from Armenia are even more outstanding. From the first notes of the first track you are hooked. This religious music from the middle ages to the 20th century is entirely different from the Gregorian and Latin forms of the West. Melodies are drawn out as if the singer and listener need to savor each note and gentle instrumental accent and emphasis. Gorecki's Symphony #3 has the same spirit and sound. Three forms of chant are presented: the liturgical sharakan, the more secular tagh, and the series of long litanies of the gandz. The Sharakan Early Music Ensemble provide the instrumental support and guest vocalists Anna Mailian and Ara Avantain tug at our heart. In 301 A.D., Armenia was the first nation to adopt Christianity; its liturgical music has deep roots. This is music of meditation and contemplation.

The given description of product and information about the artists are sufficiently thorough not to repeat them; hence, I will focus on this listener's reception to the music. However, it is worthy to add that Yemen is situated on the southwestern corner of the Arabian Peninsula bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea and facing Ethiopia and Somalia. From this ancient maritime crossroad of trade, the land has had many musical influences, stretching from Persia and India to East Africa, and is marked by intricate melodies and asymmetrical rhythms. As expected, there are a large variety of musical styles and this album does not try to survey them. Indeed, it is recorded in the home of one of a group of musicians; it is essentially a jam session, but a wonderful, richly rewarding event of oud, percussion, and vocals. Here are an oud composition that seems to echo the increasing Hindu rhythmic development of alap, jor, and gat; a steady, driving rhythm under a song of political unity; a passionate love song; an improvisation that leads to verses backed by medium then fast rhythms; verses sandwiched between instrumental interludes of different melodies and maqams, a sort of ragmala of Hindustani music. These recordings are pleasant to hear, interesting to contemplate, and surprisingly unique. This is another excellent volume of The Music of Islam series.

Not every culture has a word for music, as it is so wrapped up in religious rites and rituals and does not exist apart of them. Music as a term may be found in most Islamic nations, but the chanting or recitations of the Qur-an and the call to prayer are not regarded as such. I have heard the call to prayer often in Morocco and Turkey and the extended chants of surah are an added pleasure. This is an art form much practiced and perfected throughout Islam. Indeed, competitions for best recitation are highly regarded. This award-winning recording features five reciters from Istanbul. Regional differences, or accents, are subtle yet distinct and the sound here differs slightly from Egyptian and Moroccan reciters. As I hear this album, I recall my youthful, enthusiastic but sloppy recitation of Hebraic prayers and recitation of the Haftorah for my bat mitzvah. The Semitic commonality in sound and phrasing helps in appreciating the pure unaccompanied single voice. Nicely recorded with an chamber echo, the album lasts 66 minutes. The package insert is extensive with discussion of Islam and the text of the surahs.

This recording of 1998 (issued in 2003), when Ali Akbar Kahn was age 81, is the last released CD while he was alive and will probably be remanufactured by the family label fairly soon. Many musicians lose technique and artistic insight as they attain such an age, but Khan had continued to reach into the profundity of raga creativity. With his full powers, and playing his 1997 Washington, D.C. composition, Chandra Dhani [Moon over the Capital], and his synthesis of two ragas, Narayani Gauri, Khan presents two works associated with the evening. The joy of the moonlit evening before Khan received the National Heritage Fellowship Award is manifested in Chandra Dhani. Each piece consists of a gripping alap and rhythmic gat, both slightly under 40 minutes in duration. Swara Samrat, a title meaning Emperor of Melody and Pitch, was bestowed on Khan by his father and guru. An engineering aside is that the recording was direct to hard-drive; everything about the CD is digitally electronic. In short, this is a historic, brilliantly performed, highly meditative and spiritual recording by the Grand Master of North Indian music.

With the collapse of the Ottoman empire after World War I and the restructure of Turkey with Ataturk as leader, the push to create a modern European-looking nation suffered the excesses of many revolutions and this include the attack on traditional "Oriental" music. Folk music was permitted primarily as a source of melodies for Western polytonal composition with mainly European orchestral instruments, in the manner of Bartok and Khachaturian. Sufi lodges were disbanded and with them their rites and music. This book discusses the history of musical forms in Turkey before, during, and now after the politically directed injunctions in a scholarly but readable anthology of papers presented at a conference in Istanbul in 1997. Included is a paper on the role of Jews and Jewish religious music in Ottoman art music. Another article of note is on Albania as another example of political interference on traditional musics. Key to the recent relaxation and influx of musical influences from neighboring Middle Eastern lands was mass communication: recordings, tapes, and the internet and the role of musicians themselves in wishing to expand and explore their idioms. This book provides a fine introduction to the complex of music, Islam, and society in one of the crossroads of the world.

Minoru Miki is a leading classical composer of Japan, best known to Western audiences for having established the Pro Musica/Ensemble Nipponia, which promotes traditional music throughout the world and performed on three excellent albums issued by Nonesuch. This compilation, Volume I of Miki's selected works, is performed solely with traditional instruments. The first work is a concert suite on the seasons derived from his previous dance works. Since Vivaldi, the seasons have been an impressionistic theme for classical works, and Miki's brief sections do indeed capture the respective moods. (In 1992, he and the Pro Musica Nipponia would produce a set of 4 CDs each dedicated to a season, which consisted of adaptations of well-known traditional Japanese classical, folk, and theatre [No, Kabuki] melodies.) The second composition on this particular album, Hote, is a three-part modern and innovative percussive work suggestive of a ceremonial flame. Behind the four taiko players are nearly a score of koto and flute players who create a festive atmosphere. It reminds me of Kabuki, with its dramatic sections and accents. The final work, Wa, is complex and as varied as the meaning of this Japanese syllable (concepts with an enso circle, such as totality, a wheel, harmony, an interjection of surprise). It is sparse, beginning with solo koto and developing with biwa, shakuhachi, and various percussion in permutation and combination. While having the sound of an old classical work, the piece is thoroughly modern and somewhat improvisational. This album is rich in melody, rhythm, and timbre and may be enjoyed by all those who appreciate contemporary classical and world music.

After Toru Takemitsu, Minoru Miki is perhaps the next leading classical composer of Japan. Both wrote truly modern Western classical music with Japanese sensitivity and tranquility that often included traditional Japanese instruments. Miki is best known for his operas and for having established the Pro Musica/Ensemble Nipponia, which promoted traditional music throughout the world (three excellent albums were issued by Nonesuch). This particular compilation, 2 CDs, is volume IV of Miki's selected works, and his composing talent is manifest in a trilogy. Its Prelude for shakuhachi, 20-string koto, shamisen, and strings (1969) seems to be a wistful remembrance of the old Japan while the nation rapidly modernizes in the Western style. This piece is followed by a concerto for koto and orchestra (1974) whose theme is of the tension of human and the natural environment and has the flavor of a Noh drama. The final work, performed by Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhous Orchestra with Japanese instruments (biwa, shakuhachi, shamisen, and drums) is Symphony for Two Worlds (1981). This is complex, dynamic interaction, full of energy and pathos. It reminds of kabuki. This is an important album in this series.

Coming to Rio de Janeiro from Northeast Brazil in the 1970s, Djiavan sings a modern, popular style with a good share of soul, akin to Stevie Wonder and some contemporary bossa nova jazz artists. His voice alone is what attracted me when first encountered in a survey of Brazilian traditional and popular music. I obtained this album among his recent works because of its especial sweetness and great variety of feelings. An occasional minor key sad ballad [a torch song?] is balanced by happier romps. The track Milagreiro alternates with Spanish and Brazilian motifs, and different rhythms throughout the album, from soft rock to bossa to jazz fusion, maintain interest. Liner notes are provided but, alas, I do not read Portuguese and surely miss out, certainly on the content of lyrics. Djavan is an outstanding vocalist ... and composer. The 50 minutes of this ear-opening album create a strong desire to hear more.

Sister of guitarist Pedro Bac&aacute;n [Pedro Pe&ntilde;a Pe&ntilde;a}, In&eacute;s sings the Lebrija style of her home. She is accompanied by Mora&iacute;to [Manuel Moreno Junquera] on guitar and an ensemble who provide palmas, the rhythmic clapping of flamenco. This is family-style flamenco (which I can attest having recently participated in juergas among a couple gypsy families in Andalusia). Indeed, In&eacute;s, her brother, and family had toured together. The cante sometimes refers directly to family or self, and there is the customary tragic lament of the siguiriya. Bac&aacute;n, however, also provides a lively buler&iacute;a dance and the Arab-influenced taranta. She also is among the few women who sing the marinete, the cante of the blacksmith forge. There is no hammer on anvil, but the rhythm (also unusual by its steady consistency) is provided by drumming the guitar. This album does not present a tour de force or vocal pyrotechnics. Instead, it is exemplar of the richness and depth of flamenco among families and within family life. The professionalism is such that the pieces and performance are unpretentious and seemingly unpolished.

This album, Painted Lady, is a reissue of the 1981 edition. Another edition was entiled Goldern Lady, which confuses matters. From the list of tracks, Lady is the theme. Abbey Lincoln here is backed by a very swinging band led by the tenor saxophone of Archie Shepp, or perhaps Lincoln supports Shepp, because the sound is different from Lincoln's many other recordings. Vocalist and band complement each other. One reason I purchased this album was that I liked the version of her powerful song, Throw It Away, but her sensitive intrepretations of the other tunes, from Ellington's Sophisticated Lady and Stevie Wonder's Golden Lady to Michel Legrand's What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life surprised me. This is a strong concept album and Abbey Lincoln is at the top of her style, with emphasis on words and their instrumental phrasing. Other band members are Roy Burroughs, trumpet; Hilton Ruiz, piano; Jack Gregg, bass, and Freddie Waits, drums.

I recall the day when Nonesuch Explorer, then a new label, issued Escalay, the Water Wheel. We were all agog at the oud playing and the deep spiritual feel of the music. While Eclipse remains my favorite recording of Hamza el Din, chiefly because of the inclusion of tracks where he plays the tar frame drum, this album from Water Lily is highly worthwhile because of its superb engineering and because of the powerful improvisations. I was fortunate to hear Hamza play in an intimate setting, and this recording well matches that experience. As you listen to the album, you will hear hints of Escalay in the second track and hear Hamza sing on the third track. The longest track is Allah Hu Akbar, which is a religious meditation that begins again with the Escalay tune and rhythm. The final track, Hamayala, of which another performance appears on the JVC album, is a drum track in which Hamza again sings.

Interdisciplinary, or more often cross-disciplinary, studies of culture are always facinating examinations of zeitgeists even if conclusions are stretched and the approach is highly selective. The influence of science on art, and the use of art in science; the experiments in literature; and the changes in public perception with advances in medicine and technology have been behaviors and traits for the crucible by such authors as Leonard Shlain [Art & Physics; Paralllel visions in space, time, and light] and Afred Appel, Jr. [Jazz Modernism: From Ellington and Armstrong to Matisse and Joyce]. Focusing on the very rich 40-year period at the turn of the 19th century, Stephen Kern presents the revolution in communication and transportion that transformed people's lives and altered perspectives and perceptions. As in our time the internet and mobile telephone have been an immensely powerful social force, allowing us to observe and participate in distant events as they occur, so too was the development and spread of the telephone and wireless telegraph (radio), medical X-rays, cinema, the phonograph, and the bicycle, automobile, and airplane between 1880 and 1918 (the end of World War I). Kern largely restricts his theme to time and space and offers examples of repercussions in the visual and musical arts and in literature and philosophy.This scholarly book is for the academic and educated general reader and makes reference to classical and refined cultural media [Proust, Kafka, William James, Henri Bergson, Cezanne, et al.) rather than the popular, with the exception of cinema and phonograph. Nevertheless, it is a stimulating intellectual history whose lessons are easily applied in contemporary society. Kern provides myriad amazing facts, much like the brushed dabs of paint by Monet in an Impressionist painting, of how standards and institutions that we take for granted actually came into being. That period certainly was exciting and highly creative in all realms of endeavor from the arts and sciences to business and medicine, from entertainment to philosophy. It is a shame that Kern does not convey the joy, with perhaps the exception of his review on speed affecting everyone's life, but I still found his book to be a very worthwhile, indeed important, read. (As a published historian of microbiology, which developed during this period, I found Kern's discussion of adjacent cultural fields particularly helpful.)

These are field recordings from 1955 and 1960. Wait! These tracks moreover are very finely recorded and remastered performances obtained by the late Indian ethnomusicologist Deben Bhattacharya. Here is Arabic music scarcely tainted by American and European influences. Here is traditional music from Syria featuring qanun zither, oud, and ney flute as well as an alternatively tuned Western violin and the now infrequently recorded buzuq, a three double-string lute (related to the Greek bouzouki and Turkish saz). Most recordings took place in a chamber whose acoustics bring space and distance and a live sound. Taqsim improvisations, as Indian alaps, devoid of rhythmic base other than internal phrasing and pauses, lead the developed maqams or scales, modes that are unique in their ability to evoke particular emotions. Track 6, in hijaz, is especially interesting and cheerful: it is from a dervish rite and has duff frame drum, naqqara kettle drums, and khalili cymbal percussion. The final track also is a dervish tune, in sikah. At the time of this review, Syria is in the midst of internal strife, with death and destruction. Listening to this music, from an era of peace, is much with hope for resolution and a time when Syrians can once again turn inward, enjoy and be spiritually moved by music. Duration: 54 minutes.

Owning several recordings of Shri Rag, a late afternoon raga, including performances by Ali Akbar Khan solo and in duet with Ravi Shankar, I assumed that a live concert recording of this raga played by Nikhil Banerjee would likewise be worthwhile. That proved to be an understatement. Of 78 minutes duration, half of which is in alap and jor development, the piece evokes the sleep-inducing heat of the day, a bit of sadness, a dollop of acquiescense, the sweet anticipation of the stillness and company of early evening. Accompanying Banjerjee on tabla is Swapan Chaudhuri, who was Ali Akbar Khan's main percussionist. Swapanji always seemed to me a mountain, stable and strong, who avoids showmanship and fully supports the solist with unerring rhythmic drive yet with clever innovation. The first gat section here is in jhaptal, a 10-beat rhythm; the concluding gat is 16-beat tintal. As for engineering, the microphone is very close to the instrument, and we hear every finger pluck and the vibration of the bass strings. Indeed, it is the early bass notes, approaching that of a surbahar (bass sitar), that create the feeling of late afternoon. Banerjee was a genius of the sitar, spiritually profound in his approach to the raga moods, as this recording demonstrates.

To dispel any confusion, the cover image of this CD is different from its paper sleeve, which is the photograph seen on the .mp3 page of the album. Originally issued in 2002, this is a studio recording of a similar concert performance of Turkish Sufi music consisting of improvisations by various solo instruments and hymns. The musicians are from the State Conservatory of Afyon Kocatepe University. [For a more exciting recording on the ARC label, see EUCD 2086, Music of the Whirling Dervishes by the G&uuml;lizar Ensemble, members from Turkish Radio and Television and the Ministry of Culture; neither album is from a formal Mevlevi or Rifa'i order, but I attest that, having heard both in private session, the music is authentic although the performance lacks that special edge when part of rituals.] The ensemble plays the ney flute, oud, kemeche fiddle (akin to the Cretan lyre and not the Persian spiked fiddle, kamanche), kanun zither, bendir frame drum, tanbur long-neck lute, kudum small kettle drums, halile cymbals, and cello. There is a sameness over the 59 minutes, with no zikr to break the mood; however, the dignified, gentle music provides serenity and spiritual openness.

In the other albums of Alkan works performed by Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin, particularly the Concerto for Solo Piano and to some extent the Grande Sonate, Alkan seems to be foreshadowing Rachmaniov and the later romantics. In this album, Alkan is the classicist extension of Beethoven and Brahms leading up to Chopin. Alkan, however, is entirely unique in his style and composition, which is why his works amaze and captivate, more so since his life is sketchy and his works little known. The four etudes that make up the Symphony for Solo Piano have a classical coherence and remarkably have the symphonic sweep and balance. Passion and strenth dominates. In the smaller pieces that follow, the moods shifts to calmness and religiosity. The last work in the album is an earlier trio of romantic, lyrical, but less distinguished compositions. "Le vent", for example, is far too literal and obvious. Throughout, Hamelin is outstanding in his technique and sensitivity. The recording, however, is less exciting and noble than the others in the series. Still, if you own one or the other album, you will want this one also. Alkan is too fascinating and Hamelin is too good to stop at one!

Perhaps the most played track of this album on radio is Ernie Andrews' medley that presents a concise history of jazz vocal styles. Yes, this all-star concert does indeed gives us a sweep of great jazz classics from Ellington to Miles, from Basie to Parker. Gene Harris, Kenny Burrell, Harry "Sweets" Edison, George Mraz, Lewis Nash, and Stanley Turrentine, all brilliant in their art, instruct us in the joy of jazz. Moreover, this recording conveys that magic of a live performance before a receptive audience, here in a private concert. An awesome album by master musicians. Jazz is a difficult musical art, but these guys make it seem too easy!

One of the great offshoots of the huge Ali Khan tribe of Sufi classical and Qawwaili singers were the Ali Brothers and their children. In this album we hear one of the brothers, the late Salamat Ali Khan, performing classical ragas with support of his sons Sharafat Ali Khan, Shafqat Ali Khan, and (listed among the musicians) Sukhawat Ali Khan and Salamat's daughter Riffat Salamat. This is a 1997 recording and the sons, daughter, and grandson Shujat Ali Khan are now carrying on the tradition on their own. The album makes use of New Age synthesizer electronic drones and pseudo horns as well as a variety of acoustic instruments, from santur hammered zither to a digeridoo (Stephen Kent) to piano, violin, and wind chimes. Sukhawat Ali Khan plays harmonium, his specialty. The various instruments project atmospheres more accessible or familiar to the general public. Thus, this is a popular fusion album, though Salamat Ali's sensitive singing is at its heart. I personally do not like the New Age fog. For a drone, a tanpura or two would suffice. Perhaps the musicians were seeking a more global spiritual core. On the other hand, this album brought the entire family together, which itself was rare. It has a foot in the past and one in the future. Both Sharafat and Sukhawat continue explorations in fusion, Sukhawat more in the Qawwali dance style. The album lasts 73 minutes.**** for Salamat Ali Khan / *** for the New Age album.

Like Turkish music in the 18th century, the Orient has beckoned classical composers with exotic melodies and rhythms, if not timbre or modes. Although the Dutch and English in the 19th century had trade outposts in Indonesia, the music of this island group did not make waves until impressionists Ravel and Debussy visited the world exhibition in Paris in 1889, where they heard a Javanese gamelan. Its influence, however, was limited until composers journeyed to Indonesia. The main contemporary proponents of this sound have been Lou Harrison and before him Colin McPhee, who stayed in Bali 1931 to 1939. As this present recording demonstrates, McPhee was following the footsteps of an earlier classical composer who came to Java in the mid 1920s. Godowsky, an immigrant to the United States from Poland, composed his Javanese Suite for piano in a romantic European style. At times the rhythms of Java appears, other times a theme, but the music mainly is impressionistic and atmospheric. The album also contains three very brief pieces by Alexandre Tansman, another Polish immigrant, that is somewhat closer to the Indonesian idiom. Performing these works exquisitely is Esther Budiardio, who happens to come from Java. Her soft, flowing and melodic "In the Kraton" contrasts with the bright and loud and percussive "A Court Pageant in Solo": she is convincing in both and the other sections of the suite. Thus, if you enjoy the miniatures of Debussy, you may want to consider this exellent album. [Other early composers who wrote Indonesia-influenced pieces are Paul Seelis (1876-1945) and Constant van de Wall (1871-1945).]

Thirty-five years after this album of 1974, Ivan Lins would become the sophisticated, mellow, award-winning composer-singer. This early album reflects youthful excitement and the rising popular experimental period following the bossa nova boom. Along with Lins, songs are co-credited to Ronaldo Monteiro, Paulo Cesar Pinhero, and Victor Martins. Lins covers one tune by Caetano Veloso. Arrangements include samba rhythms, American 'smooth jazz' styles, and touches of jazz rock fusion. Lin is supported by a couple dozen musicians, including chorus. The 31-minute long album is good and enjoyable, but musically undistinguished among similar releases at this time. I expect that the lyrics, which, alas, are not translated from the provided Portuguese, make the album more special for Brazilians. Maybe not.

Many flamenco cantaors, singers, are known for their rough, gritty, scorched voice that borders on the scream; others bring forth a smoother yet shaped voice of passionate improvisation. Some cantaors tend toward lively buler&iacute;a and tiento dances or more freeform fandangos. Manuel Aguejetas, a former blacksmith whose voice reflects the heat, knows well the hammer of the flamenco form called martinete and also the other old forms, the sole&aacute; and siguiriya. Nearly 17 minutes at the forge makes this album unique. As it is a soundtrack, we hear also hear the wind (or more likely the flame). This naked cante weighs heavy with history. Almost as relief, the guitar enters in the next track in the 12-beat siguiriya, if a hospital lament is a relief. Chico Mora&iacute;to is the guitarist; he brings out the best of the cantaors he accompanies and here he is almost minimal, just adding emphasis. If you desire an uplifting flamenco album that brings forth the dance of joy, do not look here. Instead, this recording plunges the depths; we feel the pain, the cry, the loss, and death. But also dignity and acceptance.

Yet another Andean panpipe group? Yes, there are a large number of ensembles from Peru, Bolivia, and some from Ecuador and Chile that specialize in traditional panpipe music that originated with the Quechuas and Aymaras and other native peoples of the region. With so many choices, why consider Los Rupay? First, the seven-member group arranges the songs very well and their performance is excellent, truly top notch professional. Second, their instruments, while traditional, are more extensive, with the kena open-notched and the pinquillo and tarka end-blown flutes, in addition to the usual zampo&ntilde;a panpipes, plus large bombo and smaller wankara drums. Other instruments came after the Spanish invasion: the guitar and the native's own invention, the famous charango, with its armadillo carapace body. Thus, this is no field recording. Although the music is derived from folk sources, it is contemporary and urban. The album is a reissue of a 1994 recording, and the enclosed booklet provides no information on the tracks. Nonetheless, the recording has verve and joy and is among the best in my Andean collection. Good cheer!

Do seek out this out-of-print book and discover one of the most profound philosophies of this existence of phenomena, which arose in ancient China between the 5th and 8th centuries A.D. and developed in a very similar form in modern England by Alfred North Whitehead. This book compares and distinguishes the two conceptions, best regarded with the metaphor of Indra's jeweled network where each event is reflected everwhere, a mutual arising and intepenetration. The things we know are not solid nouns but action verbs, gerunds. The book emphasizes Buddhist philosophies and is thick with corollaries that could leave much to ponder. As modern physics has established matter entanglement, these related philosphies are not mere woolgathering but related to psychological experience and laboratory experiment. Other books are still in print that describe Buddhist Hua-Yen, and few examine Whiteheadian process metaphysics. This book is unique in its analysis of both.

Vaughan Williams' opera of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress was a career-long project, begun in 1906 and completed in 1951. During this period, the work-in-progress served as both source and inspiration for several religious choral works and also his fifth symphony. Indeed, the Romanza movement of the symphony was extracted from the opera. This album includes these opera-derived pieces.What is it about a fifth symphony among a long series? Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Sibelius, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, among others, produced remarkably strong and well-developed fifths that are highlights of their symphonies. Vaughan Williams' own such symphony is lyrical and lush. Its suggestion of a contemplative theme is as evident as the body of Mahler's symphonic explorations. In the hands of Richard Hickox and the London Symphony Orchestra, plus an engineering team to produce this excellent SACD recording, the symphony shines with romantic beauty. It has a largely quiet pastoral feeling. Although I admit that this is my least favorite Vaughan Williams symphony, I do enjoy the rich harmonic wash of sound, and that sound itself is wonderfully full and clear with a surround-sound system. The brief vocal and organ works are pleasant but essentially fillers, although thematically related. I particularly enjoyed the heavenly Twenty-third Psalm. In contrast to the previous soft, floating music, the album concludes with a bright and powerful Prelude and Fugue for orchestra with organ, an impressive way to leave the listener.

This album will surely delight both jazz and neo-bluegrass fans, as it brings pianist Denny Zeitlin and mandolinist David Grisman together for some sparkling improvisations. The contrasting timbre of the deep piano and the soprano plucking work beautifully. Zeitlin respectfully emphasizes the lower register. Some Dawg riffs are present, of course, but Zeitlin's trademark chords and rhythmic bass line brings extra spark. Did I say fun? No? Well, it IS fun. These two artists are meshed in relaxed, creative spirit. From brightness and funk to profound, sensitive balladic explorations, the music is thoroughly joyous and interesting. Though song credits are given to one or the other, except for the blues of track 7, there can be no doubt that the finished works are a collaboration. The longest track is Zeitlin's march, where the dual stretch into unknown regions, but the final track, Fourteen Miles to Barstow (a Mojave desert area town) is truly into the musical hinterlands. Here is 57 minutes of splendid, well-engineered jazz on Grisman's Acoustic Disc label.

As the midnight hour approaches, emotions and thoughts become serious. Deep blues arise. Spiritual resolve develops. The day is over and a new one, full of potential, soon approaches. Darbari Kanada is a rag of this period, and in this recording Hariprasad Chaurasia is the instrumental voice of the ancient dhrupad singer. His alap is deliberate and dignified, and as it smoothly transitions to the more organized and rhythmic jor the raga maintains its mood. When the tabla enters at the gat section, we hear the younger son of Alla Rahka, brother of Zakir Hussain. Fazal Qureshi moves into a 10-beat (jhaptal) gat and then a 12-beat pattern of 4-4-2-2, a special tal called chau-tal (ektal is the general 12-beat term). Qureshi maintains the family tradition and performs with strong and highly varied improvisations, never upstaging the flute but driving the raga mood forward toward karmic action. The final track is a romantic folk melody, called a dhun; it is traditional to end a concert with such a light classical piece, essentially an encore. After the gravity of the major piece, it is refreshing and being mishra, or mixed, we hear different raga scales or melodies. This is very fine album and, along with the album Rag Bhimpalasi by both these artists (no longer available), is among my favorites of the Nimbus series.

Morocco is renown for its various Sufi brotherhoods (and its similar gnawa groups), all with unique musical sounds and approaches to trance. Brotherhoods center around particular Sufi saints, and the group of this recording, the Aissaoua, are followers of Shaykh al-Kamil (Adbd Allah Sidi Muhammad ben Aisa as-Sufiani al-Mukhtari. The recording is at a hadra, or public rite, held in a home and is composed of a selected suite of dikhr songs that are supported by small clay drums and the large wooden frame drums and cymbals. Remembrances and blessings are bestowed and other liturgical functions occur. There are various rhythms of songs (2/4; 6/8; 5/4) but at one point the tempo accelerates to take the participants toward baraka, the altered reality of bliss. The closing sections involve the ghaita, a shrill double reed oboe that was made famous by the early recordings of the Jajouka brotherhood. As part of The Music of Islam series, the album provides insight into the religion and the role of music, but from the perspective of a purely music listener, the recording could be tedious and uninteresting. Other recordings of Sufi music, or sam, would be better choices here, but if you desire a field recording of what occurs in Sufi ceremonies, then this album certainly is valuable.

Having just read the ethnomusicological book "Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia," I desired to hear some musical examples but was astonished to find very few available in the United States. This album, part of the Music in Islam series, is a worthy rarity. It focuses on Western Sumatra and the Aceh province; if that sounds familiar, it is because the northern tip of Aceh was smashed by a tsunami in December 2004 with devastation and much loss of life. The instruments heard here are not the familiar metallophone gamelan but various types of drums and Arabian-influenced instruments, such as the gambus, an oud-like lute. Choirs, of men or women, sing religion-inspired songs in Indonesian Malay dialects or in Arabic. These areas are known to be the most orthodox and less syncretic in Indonesia. (Syncretism is the conservative way, and modernism or reform Islam in Indonesia is actually the most strict and limiting.) This is a 2-disc album of field recordings. Indonesian Islam is mainly Sunni, with a few remaining outposts of Shi'a along the western Sumatra coast. Sufism's practices, if not the formal system, probably was the first to be accepted by the populous because of its similarity to Hindu and Buddhist mystical practice and some remain among the Indonesia Sunni variations.Disc 1 (75 min.) opens with a prayer and a pre-Islamic tiger-hunting tune. This is followed by a series of drumming tracks of processions, dirges, and competitions, with various rhythms. Up to a dozen drummers perform pieces in complex interplay. The sound is similar to Japanese taiko and Korean pungmul drumming with a touch of Anglo-Dutch rhythms. Brass trays are other percussion instruments, probably introduced by immigrants and traders from Yemen. Disc 2 (76 min.) focuses on Aceh and is more varied in musical and dance types and includes more performing groups. It is by far the more interesting disc Even body-slapping percussion and double-reed oboes are heard. It opens with a lively recording of a women group with soloist, choir for the response, and male drummers. Another track is of the music that accompanies martial arts. Subjects cover earthquakes, school education, and fishing, with respect given to Allah and the Prophet. The album includes detailed discussions and notes, with several photographs. I would not recommend the album for general audiences, but for the ethnomusicologist, the avid world music fan, and scholars of Islam and Indonesia, the set of discs is important. Indonesian Islamic music, however, is more extensive, and examples from other areas and islands would be helpful. For instance, music for shadow puppet theatre of Islamic tales is common; and one island features a gamelan of pitched drums.

There is melancholy and a depth of passion in Armenian music, be it folk or sacred church music. David Parsons and Celestial Harmonies have given us remarkable series of world music: Vietnam, Cambodia, and the spectrum of music within Islam. These recordings from Armenia are even more outstanding. Many are familiar with the dudek flute, an instrument made popular by Djivan Gasparyan. Its haunting, rich tone represents Armenian music well. This 2-CD album of folk music, performed by the Shoghaken Folk Ensemble and the Sasun Folk Group, is filled with wonderful slow ballads and laments and medium tempo dances. Armenia, while at the edge of Europe, is more strongly influenced by Persia and to lesser extent Turkey, and it has adopted the Persian kamancha fiddle and the Near Eastern qanon zither. The shrill double-reed zurna and its kin are found in many world folk traditions, and the shevi, an upper range reed flute, is heard, but it is the duduk, as melody and as drone, which anchors the sound. A dhol drum is heard with the dances. These recordings of traditional folk tunes may leave you a little sad but filled with an appreciation of a rich and old music. [My only complaint is that the enclosed booklet had its pages scrambled in sequence; a major printing error.]

Most contemporary classical composers, it seems, have focused on smaller chamber works, or if an extended piece, on similar tonal similar sections that are otherwise separate in emotions or progress. Stephen Hartke has a fair number of such chamber works but he also has ventured into long, indeed traditional, formats--the concerto and the symphony, albeit sometimes in fewer movements. This album, featuring violinist Michelle Makarski and the Riverside Symphony of New York City, is a good example of what arises from Hartke's deeper and earlier classical experience rather than his later multicultural pursuits. The 28-minute Concerto for Violin opens dark and somber (lento calmato e miserioso) before shifting into a vigorous scherzo-like exploration, including a cadenza. To my ears, the violin's short bowing and phrases produce an East European folkdance feel. The second movement actually employs a folk tune, this of a Shetland lament to a lost fisherman, but the melody does not arrive readily. Out of the darkness comes bits and pieces that eventually cohere into a more pleasant tune. Along the way, a little Stravinsky peaks in. This thoughtful work will not lift spirits, yet it is attractive and interesting. Hartke's Symphony No. 2 is born of tragedy, the death of his father. It hence has an elegiac construction. A violin and cello pavane starts the narration. The following movement is a scherzo heralded by a fanfare and led by a bassoon and interjected oddly by a steel drum. The lively movement has conflict, anxiety, and some anger. The closing movement attempts to resolve the grief. A repeated chorale ensues, the perhaps symbolic harp playing the last version. Horn, piano, and bongo punctuation give way to a cello, the human cry, as final statement. These modern works are romantic in spirit. The clarity and orchestral hues must be sought within the darkness. The search is worthwhile.

This second, extensive anthology of the recordings of the French-Canadian folkloric but not so traditional band, La Bouttine Souriante, makes a fine introduction to the party, if you are not already familiar with them. The notes honor the contributions of past and current musicians, for the band has become an institution, like a symphony orchestra or jazz big band, one that has been around since 1976 and now includes around 10 members (the brass component since 1992). The tracks are well chosen, and though they are of varied quality, they demonstrate a continuity of their sound over the decades; yet taken together they do not satisfy as several of their superior albums. Lyrics are included, as well as album source and featured vocalist. The CD portion consists of 21 tracks over 77 minutes! The DVD contains, in French and in English, a detailed discography with commentary and samples; biography of the band; their awards; a section of posed and casual photographs; interviews (English subtitles when necessary); and six videos of comparatively tame ad hoc studio performances. I wish that this video portion would have been of a live concert before a large audience, because it is here when the band truly becomes exciting. Thus, this album is worthwhile documentation of an important band after its first 30 years.

Written in 1945, Korngold's romantic, joyful violin concerto has some of the same romp and lyricism as his famous Oscar-winning cinematic music to Robin Hood. He was already an established classical composer before traveling to the United States for the first time in 1934 at the urging of Max Reinhardt to assist in the film, Midsummer Night's Dream. A young student of Zemlinksy and supported by Mahler, Korngold had already composed a piano sontata, incidental music to another Shakespearean play (Much Ado About Nothing), a piano concerto for the left hand, and several operas, and the movie project primed him to an alternative career. He returned to Vienna to conduct opera, but in 1938 quickly returned to Hollywood, with many other Jews fleeing Nazi Germany and Austria. Before his death in 1957, he picked up his classical pen again to compose a cello concerto, a symphony, and other works. Goldmark is a less familiar composer of an earlier generation that moved from classical to romantic styles. His Violin Concerto of 1877 is in the tradition of Mendelssohn, sometimes meditative, sometimes rhapsodic. The violinist of these excellent recordings is Vera Tsu, born in Shang-Hai and educated at Julliard, who is in mid career as soloist and symphony member. Yu Long, also from Shang-Hai, ably leads the Razumovsky Sinfonia of Slovenia. The album is a fine pairing of concerti, linked by ethnicity and region and affording musical generational contrasts: over an hour listening of interesting, satisfying music at a bargain price.

Being raised on Chopin, I should have known about Szymanowski, but, as many, I was ignorant of this fine, turn of the previous century (1882-1937) Polish composer. He was born in the Ukraine, studied in Warsaw, and dwelled in Paris and Vienna and in 1919 in the now independent and democratic Poland. His music is rich and beautiful, influenced by Debussy, Ravel, and Wagner. His intellectual interests turned to Greek civilization, early Christianity, and Islam. This album, 62 minutes of choral music, was recorded in 1989 but released on Naxos in 1996. Another, more recent recording of the main works is found on the same label, also featuring a Polish orchestra and singers. (I selected this one from listening to samples.) While Veni Creator is more lively, Stabat Mater unfolds in serious contemplation.Other shorter works at the Litany to the Virgin Mary, a pure choral composition; Demeter on a Greek mythological theme; and Penthesilia for soprano, in this instance Roma Owinska. The performances are splendid, especially in Stabat Mater with the soprano, Jadwiga Gadulanka, and contralto, Krystyna Szotek-Radkowa, providing depth and sweetness. My only caveat is that the engineering was inadequate for the task. Distance and flatness of sound took away some of the music's power. This album, nonetheless, had led me to other, symphonic and chamber, works of Szymanowski. If you like the music of Arvo P&auml;rt and Gorecki, this predecessor may be a pleasant discovery.

Brubeck, like Ellington, composed jazz works influenced by the lands he visited. Both were never literal; they never adapted or borrowed ethnic melodies, although Brubeck did take home rhythms. Jazz Impressions of Japan is a little heard, somewhat flawed gem whose gleem offsets some of the silliness. Tokyo Traffic, the first track, sounds a little too Oriential stereotypic, more Chinese-like, but the helter-skelter feeling was conveyed along with a great central musical development of the tune. In immediate contrast is Rising Sun, a beautiful ballad of a dawn. Brubeck consciously wrote Toki's Theme as a parody, a comment on East-West pop. Fujiyama is as wonderful as the mountain, and Brubeck and Desmond do justice to this Japanese icon with cloudlike swirls on the piano and a haunting saxophone tune in the sky. Zen is When again applies stereotype Orientalisms in the arrangement, particularly the percussion and is so un-Zen, though Brubeck knew the underlying philosophy. We are relieved to hear next The City is Crying, with its West Coast jazz flow: very cool indeed. Osaka Blues, largely forgetable, marks the end of their tour, but the album closes with Koto Song, which best reaches into the traditions of Japan: quiet, reflective, with a touch of sweet melancholy. Another, more inventive rendition of this piece may be found on their 1975: The Duets album.

As I began playing this CD, I was immediately struck by the crystal clarity and depth of sound, even in the introductions by Gere and the Dalai Lama; however, the sound was not natural but obviously amplified, with distant microphones, treble dominance, and hall echo. The listener seems to be at the balcony. This is easily forgiven because what follows are extraordinary sets of music by extraordinary artists. After a brief invocation by the Gyuto monks, Anouska Shankar, whose technique is a marvel and whose interpretative skills continue to mature rapidly, performs a gem. Then we have a peaceful duet by Tibetan and Amer-Indian flutists, but in this instance Nawang Khechong eschews his usual instrument at first for a monastery long trumpet and recitation to accompany Carlos Nakai's flute. In what I think is the best work of the CD, The Gambia, Philip Glass's keyboard and Foday Musa Suso's kora provide a most interesting sonic mixture and a beautifully crafted composition. The listener will certainly long to hear more of these masters in duet. The remainder of the concert features Tom Waits, whose gravel-throated, dramatic singing is accompanied by the Kronos Quartet and bassist Greg Cohen, whose arrangements match the wit of the lyrics. Waits also provides some humorous comments. The fact that sale of the CD will provide funds for medical care of Tibetan monks and nuns in India made my purchase even more worthwhile. The enclosed booklet includes some rather nice photographic portraits of the performers.

Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain, is the home of the deep or serious cantes, the siguiriyas and soleares, but also the festive buler&iacute;as. They are often performed with dancers. The third element is the guitar and here, too, Jerez has its own style. The family Fern&aacute;ndez de Jerez includes some major flamenco artists--cantaors, dancers, and guitarists--and among them is Manuel Fern&aacute;ndez Molina, whose stage name/nickname is Parrilla de Jerez. [A parrilla is a grill pan; coincidentally, his brother Juan, another guitarist, runs a splendid flamenco club and restaurant in Jerez.] In this solo album, his strong and inventive elaborations will stop you in your tracks. Although influenced by Ni&ntilde;o Ricardo, Parrilla's style is distinctive, with a flair both classical and modern. As expected, his siguiryas are thoughtful with gravitas, but he is also at home with a romantic malague&ntilde;a and a joyful tiento/tango. His high standard of technique had made him a favorite accompanist with cantaors; when alone, his rich explorations are a feast for the ears. This album, his fourth solo work, was recorded in 1998 and is well engineered. If you enjoy the guitar work of Sabicas, you will certainly appreciate this album.

[Should you purchase this album, please note that my CD has the same front cover, with red jacket, as the .mp3 edition on Amazon and not the blue-tinged cover depicted on this page.] Fonseca is a popular singer and band of Colombia whose style of rock is lyrical with strong dance rhythms of Latin and African folk origins. They also perform slow ballads. Fonseca includes accordion, harp, trombone and trumpet, and despite a battery of Latin percussion, tunes are gentle and romantic. The accordion grounds the band in folk traditions. This edition is enhanced with two interesting videos, a photo gallery, and even wallpaper and a screensaver. It also contains three acoustic versions of tunes as bonus tracks. Fonseca has a unique happy even joyous sound. This album particularly is highly varied in tempo, song selection, and performance style. While Fonseca's later album, Ilusion, is stronger in rock and Latin rhythm and more extroverted, this studio album is closer to roots. Sort of. It is difficult to pigeonhole his art. The arrangements are excellent throughout. The acoustic versions of the previous tracks are taken slower or more intimately and with more passion. Fonseca is a world-class musician.

Her studio releases were excellent but this live performance, as many concert events can achieve, is pure magic. Even at the start of her career, it is fair to predict that Kala Ramnath will forever be remembered as the leading violinist of the North Indian, Hindustani musical tradition and one the great violinists in the world. Technically precise and consistent in bowing and fingering, profoundly sensitive to the midnight mood of the rag, here Pandit Jasraj's combination Raga Nat Narayan, and open to lyrically inventive improvisations, she grabs our ear and enters our heart. Spiritual pathos and passion are evoked in the opening movement, the alap. Propelling her forward in her appearance at the 2001 Saptak Festival in Abmedabad is Vijay Ghate on tabla, whose drum work is rock solid in the initial 12-beat ektal rhythm and solo flourishes. As the piece moves into the gat or final, fast movement, the musicians shift to the 10-beat jhaptal and end with 16-beat tintal. Midnight was never so bright. We leave in delight and peace.

These three pieces of Golijov are important works. The compilation is united by a solemnity and cognition of transience, of memories, of life; the ever changing sea conveying fleeting travelers, the pain and loss of the diaspora and holocaust of Jew and Roma, the arrival and loss of our dreams and our pains, the condition of our small planet in a vast cosmos. The middle piece, wonderfully performed by the Kronos Quartet, for me it the gem of the CD, so tightly composed, each note to the mystical point. Upshaw brings an ethereal quality to the songs, providing tension and its sweet release. Oceana, the first work, has its passionate Latin textures by word and instrument, which brings new discoveries with each listening. While I would prefer an anthology with greater diversity of mood, this CD is rich in sonic treasure.

The classical Grammy Award carries prestige (those for other genres are moot) and performances by the Emerson String Quartet have earned 6 such honors (the albums of two earned additional awards). Among them is Intimate Voices, the string quartets of Sibelius and Grieg. The members of the group are indeed supurb musicians (their Shostakovich quartets...another winner...are awesome) and the sound engineering of this recording is also excellent. String quartets through the ages have a unique sound with complex interactive play; they present unique challenges to the composer. Sibelius and Grieg wrote only one each, and while Nieilsen wrote four, only his mature last quartet has lasting merit. The Scandinavian feel is pronounced in these passionate, melodious, yet serious works, with folk tunes emerging in the Grieg and the Sibelius quartet reflective of his symphonies. Intimate Voices is a recording to own and experience.

Brazil has various traditional African-influenced musical styles, depending on region. We may associate Angola as the source of slaves and the import of their music and instruments that eventually led to the samba, particularly of Rio de Janeiro. This is merely half the story, because Africans came also from West Africa, from Nigeria, Benin, and adjacent lands. Their musical rhythms and religion differed, and they settled primarily around Salvador de Bahia. This album is not of their popular music but of a religious rite, which has much in common with those found in Cuba. Candombl&eacute; celebrates the orix&aacute;s, Yoruba deities, whose mythologies are complex. Various schools and traditions developed; this one, although situated in Rio de Janeiro, is associated with a terreiro in Salvador. Three sacred drums of differing size and a clapperless bell are the only instruments of the rite. The various rhythms include 12/8 and 2/4, and many rhythms are associated with particular gods. Against the powerful rhythms, the gathering sings and trance develops, except for the drummers. I particulary enjoyed the call-and-response and the highly danceable musical pattern of track 6, Yoruba rhythms that seems familiar from carnival. The package insert provides full details about the music and mythology. This excellent, nicely recorded album gives us the opportunity to acquire a different perspective on Brazilian music.

When Ravi Shankar was nearing his 70th birthday in late 1989 (born April 7, 1920), he performed a Golden Jubilee concert in London to mark his milestone. Special events often beget extraordinary actions, and Shankar's performance of evening ragas was remarkably sensitive. It also records two musicians for the last time. He was joined on second sitar by his son Shubho (who would die from pneumonia 1992), Durga Lai (who died in January 1990) on the folk pakhawaj drum, and Kumar Bose on tabla. The two-CD set begins with Raga Jhinjhoti. It is a beautiful, romantic raga, and except for the final 6 minutes of the 39-minute piece, it is without drums; the two sitars provided the lyricism, complexity, and momentum. The drum rhythm was in chautal, 4-4-2-2, appropriate to the old dhrupad form of the performance. It frankly is the best piece in the album. This was followed by the evening raga Khamaj, which applied a 14-beat rhythm of dhamar. The second disk provides Raga Bihag, which lasts 48 minutes. This should afford Shankar another opportunity to stretch in slow development, but he doesn't. Instead, the tabla joins in also immediately. Still, the sweet Bihag scale is majestically presented and modestly improvised in slow teental for some 15 minutes, then moves into a traditional fast gat for 30 minutes. The last piece on the program, as expected, is a light classical ragmala.

Originally a poorly recorded 1959 recording, the digitial remastering has accomplished a near miracle in making this a pleasant, more than satisfactory, album of flamenco guitar. Most of the tracks are very short [total of 32 minutes] and are of the lighter, free flamenco forms, more Celtic than Arabo-Anadalus or Gypsy rooted [evidenced by castanets in the Fandango, for instance]. One exception is Soleares Jerezanas. Jerez de la Frontera is the other main center, with Moron, of Gypsy flamenco. Here, this music, supplemented by a dancer and a second guitarist, is serious and regular in rhythm and has a strong Gypsy sound. I find the guitar work very good but not outstanding; yet, Bernabe de Moron shows some compositional inspiration, particularly in track 7, Gitaneria Morisca, with its Moorish and classical [e.g., Tarrega] influences. Indeed, he often borrows from the classical guitar composers. The album closes with a fast alegria with dancer and palmeros. Considering the time, 1959, the album was designed to appeal to a more popular audience. If you are interested in deeper flamenco, seek elsewhere.

These and similar atmospheric recordings seem to have several types of buyer: those who want a sedative or sleep-inducer to calm their agitation or put them to sleep; those who want the hear an anthology of sounds they expected from watching nature shows or reading illustrated nature books; those who have a meditative ear of the music of nature and human ambience, like that of John Cage; and those who want an exotic background for routine daily activities to put themselves in another place, as if living in a hut in the field. I seek no application other than an appreciation of new sounds. I just listen to the virtual volume of space. If you are of like mind, this recording should be a worthy addition to your collection, like those of the splendid Ryko Cape Cod series.

Jessica Williams, who while spending some time on California's central coast developing her art, also plunged into the spiritual aspects of music and its performance. Over the years, she has moved away from mere cleverness and technique to chew on the marrow of the particular composition, discovering new depths. (Leonard Bernstein did this with some of Aaron Copland's works, which Copland himself acknowledged.) She excels with the ballad, the slower contemplative piece. All Alone, one of her many solo albums, is also among her best. It is perfect for Dinner Jazz, both as background and as as series of side dishes, each a unique study of form, rhythm, and feeling. All are tasty. Thus, you may regard the album as a series of separate tracks or collectively. Individually, the pieces are multi-colored piano gems; as a whole, however, the album's mood and tone, other than her jaunty work, The Sheikh, and an allegro, The Quilt, lead to a desire for more variety. However, in the spirituality of music, we must focus on the ever present, and Jessica Williams' insights are rewarding. We marvel at her playing.

Ethnomusiciologists Tamara Livingston-Isenhyour and Thomas Caracas Garcia in their book "Choro" mentioned Mike Marshall in discussion of the increasing spread and acceptance of Brazilian choro in the world. It was not a big leap for Marshall to immerse himself in this music since he was with David Grisman's jazzy dawg bluegrass band. Marshall plays his mandolin with precise technique, which came in handy in the faster tracks. By and large, however, this album gives us somewhat soft-edged choros, a tempered and smoother sound, leapfrogging samba to anticipating Gilberto's bossa nova. As Marshall himself was involved with sonic engineering and mixing, this feeling was intended. Classic choros of Jacob do Bandolim, including Nortes Cariocas, and more contemporary works by Paulino da Viola are featured, along with band member Carlos Olivera's own composition. The album is divided into two sections with different musicians. In the final three tracks, clarinetist and saxophonist Harvey Wainapel takes the place of reed Andy Connell. Percussionists also are changed and augmented. This 40-minute brief encounter with an early form of hot Brazilian jazz recast as relaxing, sweeter dinner music was interesting and pleasant. The hear choros by American artists is also worthwhile, as we witness the evolution of the musical form.

This film was a revelation, for what we regard as Irish "traditional" music, its bands, its sound and arrangements, is a development over the past 40 years. And its innovation came from the Irish diaspora back to the motherland. The country fiddle tunes and ballads persisted, of course, against the forces of religious zealotry and British assimilation, but Galic was becoming a quaint, almost forgotten language and people had disparaged the old music of poverty. Then in America, with the rising folk song fad of the late 1950s and early 1960s, a thirst among those of Irish heritage and recent emigres arose. The Clancy Brothers with Tommy Makem caught the ears of American audiences, with the help of Ed Sullivan, and the old songs became respectable. Soon, back in Ireland, The Chieftains, adopting the quasi classical orchestration of traditional instruments advocated by composer Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riada and musicologist Garech Domnagh Browne, became a popular group. As the documentary unfolds, we learn of the group Planxty and of subsequent developments in Ireland as musicians adopt and fuse rock (Van Morrison and U2), punk (the Pogues), and New Age (Enya) and how Riverdance arose with Irish-American dancer Michael Flatley. Interviews with musicians and old video clips help this history. It is a grand tale and it demonstrates how vibrant Irish music remains as it moves into various musical genre and venues. The film was shown on PBS in spring 2010 and a second volume is forthcoming with focus on contemporary groups. [New DVDs, with and without the musical CD, are distributed elsewhere at this time.]

Stylistically influenced by Agujetas, Camar&oacute;n, and Antonio Mairena, El Torto [Juan Moneo Lara] is a specialist in singing buler&iacute;a and soleares. His professional activities center on festivals, pe&ntilde;as, and various flamenco projects, such as this label's Flamenco Vivo series. This album is filled with strongly rhythmic pieces in the manner of his home, Jerez de la Frontera, wonderfully supported, as on other albums of this series, by guitarist Moraito [Manuel Moreno Junquera]. Together, and with sometimes palmas and zaptaedado by other artists in the session, they give us an album of very fine listening. Moraito tailors his accompaniment with each cantaor, and here his intelligent fingerwork matches the bright sound and interpretations of El Torto. As expected, the cheerful buler&iacute;a, allegr&iacute;a, tangos, and fandango are great fun, full of liveliness; but there are somber pieces, too. A taranto of the mines, a seguiriya, a martinete of the forge, and a sole&aacute; display Torto's inner passion, but they are less convincing than those of more gritty cantaors, for instance Agujetas. The album moreover includes a rare bambera, which has the same rhythm as a sole&aacute; but of a slightly faster tempo and a more profound feeling than associated with the original nonflamenco Andalusian children's song. The album has excellent clear sound and of a slight echo, which has presence, taking us into the studio.

The ney is a flute played throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It is a haunting instrument, more coarse than the Armenian duduk, and in Iran it is played with a different technique. This concerto for ney and Western string orchestra developed with Persian melodies, harmonies, and sensitivity is one of Hussein Alizadeh's cultural milestones. It is gripping, it is passionate, it is strikingly beautiful. Dastgah-e Nava, one of the seven main Persian modes, is the source structure of the composition. From its developmental themes, the third and fourth movements move into strong rhythms and releases, and the concerto closes with yet another dance, a 10/8 Sufi dance for two neys, a duet section of unusual sound and interest.Iran is in an earthquake zone, where the Eurasian and Arabian plates collide. Composed just before and after the 1990 earthquake, the Song of Compassion is composed for 14 folk instruments and vocalists. In stark contrast with the ney concerto, this piece sounds more traditional and akin to a Silk Road Project. Nonetheless, with closer listening it becomes a modern tone poem, a tale of the human condition when facing peril from natural disaster and how people persevere. The two works provide a different perspective of Persian music and are powerful statements.

Aaron Copland's ballet music and some cinema soundtracks are well known. The compositions of late 1930s and early 1940s on this album are also film soundtracks but are of commercial and other propagandist purposes. Musically, they afforded Copland a practical means for developing his popular style. The various films are in essence sketchbooks, some of whose music were soon adapted and expanded into his ballets. The first accompanied a drug manufacturer's World's Fair promotion piece, a puppet show. Its allusions to historical healing systems and its musical stereotypes are a curiosity. The vignettes, nonetheless, have the distinct, identifiable Copland Americana style. The City Suite is his first soundtrack. Its aim was optimistically sociologic and futuristic, a portrait of a forthcoming urban environment. The music here is more emotionally metaphoric, abstract, and symphonic. The third work, suite to The Cummington Story, is merely 10 minutes long. It was produced for the Office of War Information and concerns the settlement of European immigrants. As the liner notes remind us, the film expected that the immigrants would return to Europe after the war, making the theme about refuge and liberty rather than adoption. The final piece, North Star (1943), was about the cruelty of Nazis as they capture a Russian town and the resistance of Partisan soldiers. Copland's heroic themes and suggestions of battles are akin to another wartime composer, Prokofiev and his historical but similarly storied Alexander Nevsky. Lyrics of the track, Songs of the Guerrillas, came from the pen of Ira Gershwin. As for the performance, New York's Eos Orchestra led by Jonathan Sheffer give a good, noble account, emphasizing the composition rather than the context. They and Telarc are commended for resurrecting these ignored compositions and giving us a better grasp of the young Copland.

Particular Indian ragas are associated with a given season or time of day based on the emotion evoked by unique scales or modes. The Malhar group, for instance, are performed in the wet, monsoon months. In this lovely and beautiful performance by Nikhil Banerjee, we hear Raga Surdasi Malhar, which because it is infrequently performed or recorded, makes this recording even more special. Indeed, this is among the final concerts of Banerjee, taking place at the University of Chicago in October 1984. The sound quality is excellent. The improvisations of the 15-minute alap and 35-minute first (medium fast) gat are powerful and mesmerizing. The final and unusally long (21-minute) very fast teental gat is an exciting steady crescendo, and when the galloping jhala with the highly accomplished master tablist Abhijit Banerjee (not related) is reached, the listener is nearly exhausted: a 73-minute raga tour de force that makes you want to step outside into the rain (or Chicago's famous wind) and cool off! Banjerjee is famous for his subtle and meditatively rich improvisations, but here he is intense and hot. His fans will certainly want to add this blazing recording to their collection.

The ethnic music issues on Celestial Harmonies are usually first rate, including their package notes, and this one of music from Laos can be included. Comparatively few recordings from Laos are available, though CD-R on demand recordings and .mp3 archives can be found. Various Southeast Asian ethnicities reside in Laos, overlapping Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China; thus, there is no one typical Laotian musical form. Metallaphones (xylophones and gongs) dominate the music of temples and palaces, while flutes, drums, and bamboo harmonica, the khen, are more popular folk instruments. I purchased this album chiefly because I desired examples of Theravadian Buddhist chant. The album includes ceremonial music and chants as well as traditional folk music during the Buddhist New Year festival. Notes detail each track and give general and specific background to the music. The collection was obtained from the National Library in Vientiane's Archives of Traditional Music. Color photographs are included. These 19 tracks over 74 minutes help fill a hole in our appreciation of musical traditions of this exotic, remote nation. Indeed, the virtual acoustic space of some chanting puts me inside the temple.

Many, if not most, recordings of large Scottish pipe and drum music, seem to ignore the bass drum. Not so this recording. The sound of the musicians is crisp and clear and uncommonly well balanced. The ensemble seems to be at a distance allowing some space, meaning slight echo and full atmosphere. (It is also recorded a tad low, requiring a modest increase in my stereo volume.) While the performance lacks a little pizzazz or flair, the selections are excellent, not the old war horses, but Amazing Grace is there and it is top-notch. All in all, the CD is well-done, worthy of the band's Grade 1 & 2 ranking. Presently, this CD is best of the heap of pipe bands in my collection, and I am glad to own it.

Next to the piano, the cello is the choice instrument for grand, emotional concertos. I had never heard of this concerto, let alone Finzi, even when I began collecting cello recordings. The young Yo-Yo Ma recorded this piece, although it was not released on CD until 2007. I hope that it becomes a popular work for symphonies on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, as it is a delightful surprise. With Death looking over his shoulder, Finzi expressed his feelings and the three movements, particularly the romantic second, effectively convey his coming to terms with mortality. The two piano works, preliminary toward an incompleted piano concerto, would have had some major editing to work, as the first piece, the earliest, is so 1930s British in melody and form (almost ready to break out into the Crown Imperial march) and the second, once it gets past the neo-Baroque homage, is post-war modern in rhythm and style. Both are lovely to hear separately. The performance of soloists, Tim Hugh on cello, Peter Donohoe, piano, and the Northern Symphonia are very fine, but the engineering is average, with distance and spatial flatness, reminding me of my customary balcony perch. Still, for the Naxos budget price and the opportunity to hear little known but excellent compositions, this album is a winner.

....or, in other words, the music heard in colonial America was not just Mozart, Michael Haydn, Corelli, and Bach. This is a splendid recording by performance, instrumental arrangement, and selected works. Irish reels, sailor hornpipes, and Scotch ballads are present along with French dances, and 17th-century English popular tunes. Roots of bluegrass are obvious, and I felt the common frontier spirit, more John Adams than Thomas Jefferson. Instruments include viola de gamba, violin, recorders, pennywhistle, and lutes: a trio ensemble appropriate to a town's meeting hall. This album is my favorite of Hesperus, and its variety and brightness provide continual interest. You may find this fine background music when reading histories of the American Revolution.

Compiled from two of the original Decca ARGO albums of 1990 and 1994 (Chamber Works & Music on the Floor], except for the track Flint, this single CD is somewhat less successful than Torke's more exuberant collections. They are subdued and darker, although they still carry his percussive and staccato pulses and his instrumentally lyrical la-la-la's. This especially seen with the four tracks of Music on the Floor [his musical manuscripts were indeed strewn upon the floor while in preparation]. Slate is a dance work of four mimialistic variations. Vandana is a student piece of 1984 and is a transitional work with classical underpinnings and an orderly grid permutation of notes. Rust is a later reexamination that continues the noisy, energetic, jaggedness, with piano and brass. Fint is for saxophone quartet and piano. If I were to suggest the music of Michael Torke to someone not familiar with his compositions, I would not choose this album.

Of Frankye Kelly's thus far four albums, Live at Yoshi's is my favorite because of its great variety of jazz classics and because it provides the feeling of an honest jazz club performance. [I was in the audience.] Kelly, whose vocal range recalls that of Sarah Vaughan, is a Bay Area-based jazz and blues artist who has performed extensively in Europe and Asia. She opens the session with the rollicking Horace Silver Latin-style hit, Song for My Father, and then reflects on Old Folks. After the ballads Secret Love and Ill Wind, she returns to a Brazilian tempo with Astrud. Midnight Sun and Satin Doll lead to Lil' Darlin' and then Abbey Lincoln's poignant Throw It Away. The final three tracks are Red Sails in the Sunset, the blues Next Time You See Me, and I'll Be Seeing You. Kelly has a grand group of musicians to support her vocals: Tammy Hall, piano; Mel Graves, Dan Stephens and Charles Thurston, bass; Mari Oguara, Darryl Greene, and the great Babatunde Lea, drums, Yanci Taylor, vibes; Raul Ramierz, percussion; and on saxophones, Bobby Tynes, Howard Wiley, and Charles McNeal. Total time is 72 minutes.

Neo-romanticism remains alive with Stephen Hartke, who writes tight but lyrical compositions that look back to old Europe while remaining firmly grounded in American multiculturalism. The outstanding, lively works on this album are full of musical impressions of global places. Commissioned for clarinet master Richard Stoltzman, the Concerto for Clarinet, subtitled "Landscapes with Blues," follows the Afro-American experience from blues roots in the African lands of griot storytelling musicians (by which the ensemble's harp references the kora), to the melancholy and lonely train whistle Louisiana-Mississippi Deep South delta blues, to new challenges in the neon bright and noisy urban North of Philadelphia and New York. The composition is a wonderful vehicle for Stoltzman (who has performed Benny Goodman's and Aaron Copland's own jazzy blues concertos). As Hartke is a New Yorker (transplanted to California), his palette has hues of a train traveling from the South with melodies in the suitcase, to Harlem dance clubs, to empty noir wet streets, and concluding in a brio of activity and creative energy. The next composition, for a string octet, evokes a barren landscape except for an isolated flower, enduring life amid the windy wilderness of big skies and wide vistas. Gradus, the following composition presented to the Parnassus Ensemble and which is taken from the phrase Gradus ad Parnassum [A Step to Parnassus], gathers bass clarinet, vibraphone, piano, violin, cello, and bass for an interesting interplay of timbre, a good-spirited climbing up the heights with an intermediate rest. The final piece, Pacific Rim, dedicated for the LA Chamber Orchestra, is more musically obvious as it looks both to Asia and Latin America. It begins in Japan with with the mimicking of a sho, the harmonic wind instrument of its court music, gagaku; enters a quiet, cool cloud; drops down to Indonesia and a fast gamelan syncopation and mode; and a leap to the Indio-Afro drum rhythms of Central and South America. An echo of the sho (oboes in fact) and a Chavez-like flourish bring the work to an end. This album shines. Performing the global adventures is the IRIS Chamber Orchestra led by Michael Stern, a superb bunch of musicians. This album will be appreciated by classical and world music fan alike.

As you may surmise, this album is a retrospective of Carvalho's recordings. The earliest is 1977 and the latest is 1993, with most from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Liner notes only cite title, composer, publisher, and date; thus, the listener is assumed to know much about this mezzo. I do not. She has been associated with Jorge Arago, among others, and the original pagode party sound of classic sambas with sudro bass drum and strumming on the small cavaco backed by a crowd or chorus of singers. It is a fun, cheerful sound, mainly of, but not limited to, ballads and gentle sambas, as you may agree when listening to this album. While she did help modernize the samba, she has resisted contemporary arrangements away from traditions. She also is a composer herself but has furthered many other composers. In this collection, she sings Arago on three tracks, Danilo Caymmi, Luiz Gonazaga, Matinho da Vila, Nelson Sargento, and Adilson Bispo, among others. Thus, despite the absence of biographical information or musical analysis, the album is still a worthwhile introduction to her musical style. Duration is 63 minutes.

That this album is still available from a major label decades after its initial issue says much about its performance or engineering quality. Indeed, we have the renown pianist, Alicia de Larrocha, playing her Spanish soul music with the orchestra conducted by fellow Spaniard, Rafael Fr&uuml;hbek de Burgos. The music is lush. de Falla's reflection of Alhambra in Granada fits into his exposure to the musical impressionists while residing in Paris. The nocturn is nicely balanced with related Spanish romantic rhapsodies from Albeniz and Turinia. This music will bring comfort and relaxation and bring forth memories (or desires) of Spain. Sip that sherry and enjoy a true classic.

This recording's cover, of Shlomo Carlebach in tallith (prayer shawl) and tefillin (phylacteries) indicates that the album is more directed to deeper nigunim than his later sing-alongs, kumbaya pop, and popular Jewish religious songs. In Chassidism, the self-arising song that envelops the heart is a mystic path. This is Carlebach's second and best album. I attended a wedding he presided and this music comes closest to my experience. Carlebach's voice is direct and sincere, and the melodies are infectious, particularly hasmi'ini, a tune he reprised in a subsequent album. It is good that his colleague Mike Tabor is carrying on this spiritual tradition of introducing nigunim to a broader audience.

Modern jazz with....shamisen. Recalling the early albums of John Kaizen Neptune, a resident of Japan who plays shakuhachi free jazz, this album features some astonishing playing by shamisen player Hiromitsu Agatsuma. He established his reputation with traditional folk and classical Japanese music and later went, for me, bland New Age and very silly pop, with soft, pleasant but not remarkable original melodies and peculiar arrangements of standard popular tunes. He has moved on. These are seriously crafted compositions. A well-produced album (but with no musician credits), Agatsuma takes his 3-string, thin-timbre banjo-like instrument into new realms. The pieces maintain a Japanese flavor, with high-pitch flute and drums, and sonorous electric bass, piano and electronic keyboards, soprano saxophone, drums and percussion, trumpets, and electric guitar. There are two vocals: apparently he sings on one track and two women sing on the more traditional folk style piece. Agatsuma plays solo on one track. Complex, rich, bright, sometimes fast, occasionally beautiful, these recordings are captivating. Their unusual sound, exotic feel, sensitive performances bring great satisfaction. The notes mention that he has performed with Larry Coryell and Nana Vasconcelos. Now approaching age 40, and as this album ably demonstrates, Agatsuma is a mature artist.

I echo the other reviewers who were enchanted with Lawrence Laughing's tender, warm singing on "Orenda," with Joanne Shenandoah (another sweet and serious album, by the way). Avoiding the electronic haze of Native American New Age style with purely acoustic arrangments, but maintaining that soft, mellow buttery sound, this album is wistful. It acknowledges and gives thanks. It touches our heart. I love it. Supporting musicians are Tom Wasinger and Mark McCoin, whose instruments provide perfect accents and evocative timbre to the songs.

Of the many albums of koto music, this one--the first of the series and originally an analog LP (I owned)--is very fine because of its diverse selections of traditional pieces as well as their performance. Solos and duets and examples of the Ikuta and Yamada schools are presented. [The musicians are of Ikuta school.] The Yamada school repertoire includes pieces with vocal elements, and on Daigo No Hanami we hear a woman singer (who expresses no passion or lyrical sensitivity). The sound quality, however, is somewhat tinny and the last bonus track is outright poor, the steel-stringed reikin koto (sounding at times somewhat like the Vietnamese dan tranh zither) not helping. Still, there is much worthwhile in this survey of the art of koto and its poetic flowing of sound.

Hurrah to Naxos for their American Classics series that brings forth nearly forgotten or lost composers to the public at bargain prices. McKay was a richly romantic composer whose early works bordered on the cinematographic but whose last compositions were complex and full. This album provides examples from his three periods: the 1934 Harbor Narrative, which is practicaly a soundtrack of a voyage; the 1945 Moonlit Ceremony using themes of the Muckleshoot Northwest Native American tribe, whose rites McKay attended (McKay should be remembered for that pioneering effort alone); and the 1951 Evocation Symphony, which honors Seattle, his homebase at the University of Washington. This is a very fine recording by composition and also by performance of the Ukraine National Symphony led by American guest conductor John McLauglin Williams. I wonder how many lesser known American composers in our own time will be forgotten and then resurrected to be appreciated yet again. I am certainly glad to have acquired this recording; it is a delight.

Oregon here returns strongly to their classical roots and training. This is not a jazz-artist-with-strings format but a true orchestration with the lyrical spirit of classical chamber music yet with the ECM jazz sound. In my book, the finest recording by Oregon was their Roots in the Sky opus, and I had the delight of hearing them perform music from this period. Oregon in Moscow is far removed from that ensemble; however, in its own right, as a Third Stream venture, it is splendid indeed and richly rewarding. So, if you are both a classics and jazz enthusiast, this is a worthy addition to your collection. Up the volume to hear the textures fully.

This album has been reissued in 2011, expanded with a subtitle and new graphics. Consisting of a capella chants, guitar-accompanied songs, and haka dances, performed by nine musicians, the album covers much we expect of this South Pacific land. The trademark fierce male warrior chants are welcome, but only two examples are included. Mainly we hear group harmonies familar to all the Polynesian islands, which are not traditional but introduced by missionaries. The enclosed booklet describes the themes of the pieces and includes photographs of the group, with costumes and facial decoration. Maori songs differ somewhat from other Polynesian peoples, and instruments are limited. No drums, no Portugese guitar-derived ukeleles are heard here. The melodies are pleasant, but the engineering is ordinary and the sameness of sound (all group, no solos) become somewhat tedious. ***1/2.

Fernando Terremoto [Fern&aacute;ndez Pantoja] not only has his father's voice but he has the same stunningly powerful cante. To sing well such wide flamenco forms as deep seguiriyas, lively tangos and tientos, buler&iacute;a dances, and elaborate fandangos and malague&ntilde;as is highly unusual and Terremoto Hijo is a master. As with other cantaors of the Flamenco Vivo series of the Nave label, he is accompanied by Mora&iacute;to on guitar, whose sensitivity and confident playing brings richness to the recording. The engineering is perfect: bright, crisp, and the slight echo of the chamber makes us feel that were are listening in an intimate setting, perhaps a bodega in Jerez de la Frontera. Most remarkable is the passion and strength of the song. It penetrates, it stimulates, it astonishes. The buler&iacute;a shakes the floor, but the siguriya cries in defiance. A great flamenco album.

Cuba owes much of its music from the Bantu of Congo who came as slaves. They brought the drum, the marimba, and rhumba. And as Mali reabsorbed the blues of the American South, which was shaped by its unwilling African immigres, Congolese have reabsorbed its now Cuban-modified rhythms and melodies. And how! Kekele's third CD is their best, real Cuban roots music of Puillermo Portabales distilled through an African retort, with locally-relevant lyrics. Another full circle of true Afro-Cuban tunes that do not allow you to sit still. If you dig old Cuban sons, if you rock with the rhumba, you will love this work by Kekele!

Slidewinder remains my favorite album of Roy Rogers, an excellent slide blues guitarist. Besides having John Lee Hooker on Terraplane Blues (a collaboration that led to Rogers producing Hooker's award-winning The Healer and other albums), this CD includes Allen Toussiant on piano for two fine duet tracks. This is a happy, fun album! The Pretty Girls Everywhere stomp is a sheer delight.

Having reviewed the 2008 recording of Sharam Nazeri singing "The Passion of Rumi" and other mystical poets, I wonder how this decade earlier album would compare. Here, he is accompanied by the Shams Tanbur Ensemble. Two poems of Rumi are included plus several by Heyran Alishah. The daf drums are especially strong and the overall performance of the compositions of Kaykhosro Pournazeri is excellent. Nazeri's vocal technique is powerful and sensitive; he is a great master of this art. In short, although this earlier album is more direct and classically rooted than the more recent, it is just as worthy; indeed, depending on mood while listening, it is even more effective sam.

Hearing Renato Braz on solstice with Paul Winter, I wondered how this soft, sweet voice, similiar to Milton Nascimento's, would sound with a proper Brazilian band, hence I purchased this CD. Here, the music is not the hard-driving samba nor the sophisticated bossa--no dancing or joy; rather, it is quiet and gentle, perfect for late night relaxation. Indeed, it is a conducer of sleep. It is too low-key for my taste (the reason for the 3 stars), but I do admire his voice. If Braz had mixed the recording with some up-tempo songs to break the consistent subdued tone and prove his versatility, the recording would be a keeper.

An album of Okinawan music is rare in the United States; the few available are often cryptic, all text in Japanese and lacking samples. This album, therefore, is an important introduction, providing artists for further exploration. Okinawa is to Japan as Hawai'i is to the United States: a distant chain of islands with its own traditional music and dance as well as customs. The chief folk instrument is the snakeskined sanshin banjo, akin to the shamisen, and its music is marked by strong syncopated rhythms and exuberance. Modern Western-influence music abounds, too, as the United States has a large military presence on the islands, also a parallel with Hawai'i. Rock and hip-hop and R&B styles are found in the album. The first of 18 tracks begins, however, with tradition. Kodo Kuduchi's song is like a talking blues. Four sisters and a recorder (flute) band team up in an anthem-like tune. This is followed by Takashi Hirayasu and Bob Brozman in a change of pace--a funky, bouncy folk song with steel guitar about a flying tree spirit. The group Shisars stretches children songs into psychedelic acid rock, with clarinet, drums, percussion, and electric guitar. Misako Ohsiro takes us back to roots, and her soulful singing resembles Japanese poetic style but it is more playful, as a skipping child. Track 6 adds modern lyrics to a traditional melody; this music of Rinji Kadekaru is supported by drums, guitars, and horns. Okinawan trance music? Sarbandge is an electronic collaboration of vocals, keyboards, and strings that is more an atmospheric dance than the art of shamans. Misako Koja is a popular soloist; a sweet ballad is provided here. Saxophone and bass clarinet, bass, and bells are featured on the following track by Tetsuhiro Daiku; it perhaps gives us the best blend of modern and tradition with a classic Okinawan rhythm and happy song. The female quartet of Akanars present sort of an R&B dance with brass, saxophones, organ, guitars, and drums. Rikki sings a haunting old folk song, accompanied by the splendid sanshin of Shunzo Tsukiji, drums, guitar, and what may be an accordion or harmonic keyboard; it is one of my favorite tracks. A drum leads Yakusatsu Ohshima's ballad, another strong, modern song that reaches back to traditions. Keith Gordon and Jon Taylor are not Okinawans but British and American musicians whose Ryukyu Underground blends a variety of hip-hop, electronica, and traditional vocals and sanshin dubs into an Okinawa-inspired dance beat. This is followed by a peculiar track that defies categories, with a bit of rap, a bit of funk, a bit of blues. The Boom opened Okinawan music to Japan's masses. Its included track has a rich pop anthem feeling and large rock band arrangement. Another track that screams Okinawa with its funky rhythm and folk vocals is by Seijin Noborikawa, band and accompanying soprano. The members of Nenes sing a simple nostalgic song in harmony before an audience. The final track is by the Surf Champlers. Not quite the Beach Boys, it is definitely guitar surf music and yet...it has that Okinawan back beat. It is a fun piece and definitely not your basic shima uta, island song.

"Time" is the translation of the title of this album in Amharic, the chief language of Ethiopia. Kulu Sebsibe sings the traditional style backed by a contemporary popular style band of programmed keyboards, bass, and saxophone. Sebsibe's medium soprano voice is pleasing, strong, and sensitive. The album varies from mellow grooves to older Ethiopique-style dance modes. Eleven tracks over 65 generous minutes demonstrate why Sebsibe is one of Ethiopia's stars. She sings with joy. The album is distributed in the United States by the Ethiopian AIT label. Although the arrangements are not distinguished, this "feel good" music will be appreciated by the world music fan with dancing feet.

At present, three recordings of Egyptian Sufi music are available and this review will describe commonality and their key differences. Sufism, as other mystical sects of various religions, have different schools or brotherhoods, although they share approaches: chiefly repetiton (like mantras and holotropic breathing) of "Allah", usually accompanied by in-place movement or more vigorous dancing, Qur'anic recition, and inspiring hymns or sma. [The Turkish and Syrian Sufi schools include the dervishes whose stately whirling are well known.] The Sufi gathering is a hadra and dhikrs are the rituals and practices.The 2-CD alubm of Sheikh Admad al-Tuni, the Sultan of All Munshidin [Wagram] was recorded in Theatre de la Ville in Paris. He is accompanied by nine singers and musicans, who play oud, ney flute, kamanga violin, and drums (riqq, tabaleh, naqrazan). As cantor, al-Tuni has charisma in his voice. Bathing in the enveloping sound of the instruments, his phrasing and repetitions and has power (much like a flamenco singer...a historical offshoot). The songs are slow and meditative with oud improvisations leading to fast, rhythmic dancing. While a concert, there is dhikr spirit, as no doubt the audience must be swaying in their seats. Sam is manifest. These recordings are the best of the lot.La Chdhiliyya, Sufi Chants from Cairo [Instut de Monde Arabe], features hymnist/munshid Sheikh Mohamed al Helbawy and 14 accompanists as chorus. The recordings are of the series of dhikr, hymns, and liturgies from the calling to prayer to the invocation. No instruments are involved; only clapping sometimes occur. The listener becomes sensitive to the passionate quality of the singer and the gravity of the rite. This is not a field recording and there is no sense of community. I found the album rather arid and was not moved.Also featuring Mohamed al Helbawy is the recording Egyptian Sufi [ARC]. The recording has more echo, or depth, and is clearer. Also, instruments are included: a kawala flute and drum. Here, the choir consists of four member; two others are musicians. Only hymns are offered; there is no sense of dhikr exercises as suggested in the above album. However, the superior quality of the engineering plus the addition of instruments make the album more inspiring, more effective. al-Helbawy seems stronger, richer in voice, too.

This is an urban, happy and spirited largely samba album. Katia Moraes is a Los Angeles-based, confident and strong Brazilian vocalist, and the group Samaguru knows how to play percussion, pound a pandaeiro drum, and pick a cavaquinho. The polished band plays gentle ballads as well as bright dance pieces, though these number too few. The musicians acknowledge roots of frevo, bai&aacute;o, and choro. The great variety of tempo and tunes make the album enjoyable throughout. For instance, track 7, Eitrelinha, is tropical and sultry in its wavy rhythm, and this is followed by a brassy, jazzy, up-tempo Pesca das Mui&eacute;. The last track, Ginga, is not samba; it is rock or perhaps rap in feeling and beat. I much like this album. Modern and sophisticated, the sound is of the city.

Kenny Washington, exceeding talented vocalist, has been performing a long time, but this album marked his renaissance in featured recordings, presently numering four, not counting guest appearances elsewhere [such as on Wayne Wallace's &iexcl;Bien, Bien!]. Teaming up with Michael O'Neill's band, the two hit it off so well that they issued a better sequel and continue to play together in the Bay Area. O'Neill is an excellent multi-reed man and arranger. His band plays solid, interesting jazz. The first two tracks are strong examples. I prefer Washington in up-tempo pieces, particularly when he lets loose in rapid scat, but his ballad work is also very fine. Today, Washington is a draw everywhere he appears; begin your collection with this album and follow developments.

In the old epic movie, Little Big Man, starring Dustin Hoffman and Chief Dan George, we are introduced to a transgender Cheyenne who is regarded highly by the tribe. This was in 1970. That enlightened view by indigenous people has contrasted over the decades with sometime lethal homophobia of present Western society. This documentary film, while following the tragic story of one Din&eacute;/Navaho boy, presents historic and modern accounts of "Two Spirit" Amer-Indians, those with both male and female nature, including homosexuals and transgender people. Many nations of Native Americans have traditionally accepted four genders, but such acceptance had largely been lost under the assimilative cultural policies of the government and Christian missionaries. Today, there is a renaissance of Two Spirit recognition and support. With their special insight, Two Spirit people have served as counselors and healers. The film weaves interviews with the mother and friends of the boy with Two Spirit people from other tribes, who offer other examples and background. The film points out again the spiritual wisdom of indigenous peoples so ignored by modern society. Together, it is an interesting and important documentary, which I viewed on a local PBS station.

Instrumentation in the many recordings of Buddhist chant from Japan and Korea are usually limited to a small bell or hollow, wooden, gourd-shaped percussion instruments (moktak [Korea] or mukugyoto [Japan] of various size to keep rhythm or mark divisions of chant. This CD presents are far wider assortment of instruments found among various Japanese sects: wooden clappers, serial chimes, gongs, shakuhachi flute, cymbals, and a medium drum. The great drum is absent, but the album does close with a large temple bell. I particular enjoyed track 6, Chos, with its shakuhachi, gong, and bass mukugyoto. The album is unique but very old; the digital format does not much improve the poor sound quality of the original 1970s vinyl field recordings. Hearing the instruments in person is visceral. Until a survey is produced with modern technology, this album remains the our best example of the use of percussion in Japanese Buddhist rites.

Probably among the greatest Indian musicians and the finest sitarists, Nikhil Banerjee studied with Alladduin Khan and Ali Akbar Khan and shared with his teachers the deep spiritual heart of the raga. Although having the same gurus, Banerjee's style of performance differs from that of Ravi Shankar, who is more a populist and educator. We readily hear the distinction in this live recording from October 1982 at the Berkeley campus of the University of California. After a brief alap, we are immediately sucked into the raga with a leisurely jor development (28 minutes) accompanied by Swapan Chaudhuri on tabla with an unusual 7-beat rupak tal. By the time the equally long gat of 16-beat tintal is concluded, raga Misra Kafi, a late evening piece, has left us floating. The mood of this raga is light and gentle (versus the heroic and passionate attributes of other scales). We listeners are at the hands of a master, and this beautiful album is yet another fine example of Banerjee's art. Warning: once you listen to a live recording of Banerjee, you will want to collect more!

Selected from the old 78 rpm collection of Professor Martin Schwartz (University of California at Berkeley), with his notes and commentaries, this album remains the best introduction to the history and form of rebetika [or rembetica], the music of the immigrant Greek population from Turkey, mainly from Smyrna [Izmir today]. When after World War I the Ottoman Empire was broken up and Turkey became a smaller, independent nation, the Greek minority with their Asian-influenced music and ways came to Greece. They were not particularly welcomed. Songs arising from this lower socio-economic community concerned life in cafes and taverns, hashish dens, cocaine use, gambling, gangsters and prison, brothels, death, romance, and grief. The music itself often followed Turko-Persian modes but had influences from lands bordering the Black Sea, particularly the Balkans and Jewish communities.(Roza Eskensazi, one of the stars of rebetika, was Jewish.) Instruments were initially Turkish and Arabic, such as the oud and kanoun, though these recordings featured mainly violin and sometimes cello, guitar, lyre and lauto. Singing style is Middle Eastern, as with ghazals. Do not expect high fidelity from these recordings from 1911 to 1937. This album is essentially an archive and window into times past. Indeed, very few modern rebetika albums are available, such as that from the Seattle-based group Pasatempo and also Ross Daly and Niki Tramba. This is a shame, as the melancholic music, often referred to as Greek blues, is varied, sophisticated, and enjoyable. It did influence the development of modern Greek art songs, entechno laiko. From this introduction, the listener may further explore similar anthologies of rebetika music from around the 1930s.

This trio provides an intimate sound, as a performance in a home, with romantic and liturgical songs in Moroccan dialects of Ladino, Hebrew, and Arabic. The oud is not an accent instrument but a dominant and constant character; the percussion varies with each piece, with bendir, doyra, riq, bongos, tom-tom, and even bells. Kenan-Ofri's voice is strong (she has sung with orchestras) and plaintive. It is interesting that the power and variety of Moroccan musical idioms are so integral to the culture that when most of the Jews of Morocco came to Israel, with its Eastern European musical influences, they maintained and still rejoiced in their old musical traditions. And this is a very good thing. The Arabic, North African, and Andalusian instruments, modal melodies, and syncopated rhythms are close to those of Israel's neighbors, and the spirit of old Moorish Spain, where Muslim, Jew, and Christian intermingled in peace and influenced each other's music, still is the nostalgic ideal that casts its shadow over the Levant. This recording, like those of the Yuval Ron Ensemble (also issued by Magda in Tel-Aviv), ably provides a new heterogeneous and international perspective to the sounds of that region.

Having heard Kudsi Erguner in his 1992 French album "La danse cosmique des derviches tourneurs," in which he performed as part of an ensemble, I am pleased to have found his duet of neys with his brother S&uuml;leyman. Recently, I listened to a ney duet in Persian music; the instruments are clasped differently in the mouth and the timbre is crisper. Here, in the Turkish Mevlevi lip style, the sound is breathy, full of air. It haunts and penetrates. A frame drum is the only other instrument. The slow dance takes its time in capturing the listener but when achieved, the sound and rhythm enters the marrow. There is something special about a duet of flutes, whether two Hindustani bansuris or shenhais or, here, neys. Sometimes acting in harmony or as a supporting drone or providing emphasis, the second instrument helps create a larger effect. This album is unique, and even if you have other Dervich albums, where the ney dominates, these improvisations on established modes, taken from both Arabic maqams and Persian dastghah, are worth your attention. The third track, Zikr (dhikr in transliterated Arabic), is particularly powerful. My caveat is that the listerner may tire of the sound toward the end of the 67-minute album.

I have seen John Kaizan Neptune in concert and this recording is below his standards. He can swing with jazz, even better than in his CD "JazZen", and he perform classical shakuhachi works with flare, hinted at in his duet with koto in the CD "Prime Numbers". Unfortunately, he can also plunge into banal, New Age improvisations also. "Asian Roots" is light weight. More interesting percussion may be found with Yas-Kaz's works of the 1980s. I suggest you pass on this recording and explore many of Neptune's other works.

The harp has a important place in music of Latin America. It is featured in Mexico's mariachi bands and provides color to Venezuelan songs, but nowhere does it dominate as in Paraguay, where it is the national instrument. Having heard a short but bravura performance of the Paraguayan harp just across the border in Brazil, I sought the finest recording available here in the United States, and this one of Eralio Gill gets my vote. It is a solo and dual harp album, but as a piano can be a de facto orchestra with its wide range of notes, this harp of 36 to 38 strings can offer a rich sound. The comparatively large Paraguayan harp, constructed of light-weight pine or cedar with a long resonator, has a warm, full timbre. Gill (with supporting musician Nicolarpa) plays his own arrangements of traditional and composed melodies. Track 5, which mimics a train, is a piece composed by F&eacute;lix P&eacute;rez Cardozo, who in the 1940s brought this harp to international attention. A Guaranian Indian tune is also heard. Other tracks portray animals: cat, mouse, crow, spider, rooster, bird. Track 10 is a Moorish fantasy. Considering that the plucked strings of a harp are staccato with little prolongation, melodies are filled with notes and harmonies. The sound quality is very fine, bringing out the deep resonance of the instrument. The variety of songs and the special timbre make this a very worthy and enjoyable album.

As this is largely a historical and scholarly Eurocentric book on classical music, by necessity, the exotic begins with those peoples most familiar, the once or then present enemy -- the Moors, the Turks, the Aztecs and Incas -- and the local strangers -- the Romani or gypsies and women (from the perspective of artistocratic men, of course). Opera, ballet, and symphonies are investigated in detail, with musicological analysis of those idioms, musical phrases, rhythms, borrowed instrumentation, and motifs suggestive of foreign cultures to the ignorant and untrained ears of 18th- and 19th-century European composers and audiences. The underlying connection to eroticism and forbidden pleasures, such as harems and wanton and sexy women, supported stereotypes based on fear and elitism. This book is a collection of essays from many scholars and as such varies in style and approach, but the editor has done a fine job in keeping them in balance and somewhat consistent in content. I particularly thought the introduction and the editor's own essay on Hungarian gypsies particularly worthwhile. The other examples are of the influence of Turkish jannisary music; Middle Eastern and North African romantic temptations; Spain distilled through French impressionists and Russian romantics; Central Asian stories and melodies entering Russia with its imperial expansion; the noble savage of Native Americans in early American classical explorations; the influence of Indonesian gamelan on the modern and avant-garde works of McPhee, Cowell, Harrison, Poulenc, and Britten; and African-American music of ragtime, blues, and early jazz as exotic until jazz became mainstream in the 1930s. The final chapter steps away from classical music to describe the first inroads of Hindustani music in rock music, with the author arguing for the Kinks and Yardbirds as the first groups, rather than the more popular Beatles. The index was not as complete as expected. I would have preferred more sociological history; still, there is something for every musicologist and world music fan that makes this book important and useful.

Ralph Vaughan Williams has composed symphonies with themes -- The Sea, London, and Antarctica (the last being an expanded movie documentary score) -- but he regarded his other symphonic works as purely abstract, obeying his own whim and logic. Still, the peculiar Epilogue of Symphony 6, which is a long ten minutes of quiet, minimal stirrings following a 'closing' lively, bright, angular scherzo, brings doubt to the listener. The composer works in the social environment of the day. The work was composed between 1944 and 1947: grim times of world war. What begins as a sweet lilt turns into foreboding, then strife, and ends in jaded aftermath. Symphony 8, on the other hand, is a deeply structured, richly melodic examination of form, with some witty flourishes, such as its marching scherzo and an eyebrow-raising final toccata, with its Asia-like metallophone romp.Richard Hickox and the London Symphony Orchestra do justice to these works (and a short orchestra and voice nocturne on a Walt Whitman poem) in a recent series of outstanding surround-sound SACD recordings of Vaughan Williams works. Beautifully recorded, finely performed, clear and bright, this particular album is fine listening. I have earlier Vaughn Williams recordings with Previn and Bryden Thomas; they were the best of the 1980s. Hickox and the LSO have given us recordings for our age.

As performed by students of music conservatories in Seoul and Kyongju, Korea, these recordings of July 2000 provide a brief, odd survey of the musical traditions of their nation. Instruments that I can discern (no explanatory text is provided with this budget album) include changgo (hourglass drum), piri (shawm/oboe), taegum (transverse flute), and kayagum (plucked zither). Both male and female vocalists in an apparently large chorus sing folk songs. There is no sense of the intimacy found in sanjo, Korean classical chamber music. All the five dance tracks consist of drum and flute duets. That is a lot of very similar music! The final track is a solo flute playing a classical composition. Because of the limited variety of musical pieces, I cannot recommend the album as a proper introductory survey of Korean music, and far better recordings of folk music, classical sanjo, panjori sagas, and other musical styles are available, even at budget prices. I give *** for the production of the album as a whole and **** when considering the series of individual pieces.

Manuel Morao, noted guitarist of Jerez de la Frontera, has two missions. First is to present little known gypsy music of Andalusia sung at weddings, celebrations, and juergas. His second objective is to bring young talent of Jerez to public attention through touring companies. This live 1999 recording is of such musicians and songs. Amazon provides this album on-demand CD-R, which unfortunately lacks information as to artists. The track listings are filled with typos, misspellings, and lack Spanish accents. From a search elsewhere, the chorus is Jose Vargas "el Mono"; Macarena de Jerez; Afonso Carpio "el Mijita"; Carmen la Cantarota; Maribel Vargas; and Estfania Aranda. Antonio Higuero is the guitarist. Engineer is Jos&eacute; Muniz. "Nochebuena" is Christmas Eve and the music performed by the troupe celebrates Christmas outside the church. This is truly festive, happy music. The guitar work is excellent and the chorus and soloists sing zestfully. For a different sound of Christmas, I enthusiastically suggest this album, and if you are a fan of flamenco, you would certainly welcome this recording.--------------------------------------------(1) Mi Ventana Abierta; (2) El Gloria; (3) Corrococ&oacute;; (4) Iban Caminando; (5) El Frio de la Ma&ntilde;ana; (6) Calle de San Francisco; (7) Cantaba Jos&eacute;; (8) Estaba Santa Maria; (9) La Calle Nueva; (10) Curri-Curri; (11) Ni&ntilde;o Chiquetito; (12) Melo-Melo

At present, three recordings of Egyptian Sufi music are available and this review will describe commonality and their key differences. Sufism, as other mystical sects of various religions, have different schools or brotherhoods, although they share approaches: chiefly repetiton (like mantras and holotropic breathing) of "Allah", usually accompanied by in-place movement or more vigorous dancing, Qur'anic recition, and inspiring hymns or sma'a. [The Turkish and Syrian Sufi schools include the dervishes whose stately whirling are well known.] The Sufi gathering is a hadra and dhikrs are the rituals and practices.La Chdhiliyya, Sufi Chants from Cairo [Instut de Monde Arabe], features hymnist/munshid Sheikh Mohamed al-Helbawy and 14 accompanists as chorus. The recordings are of the series of dhikr, hymns, and liturgies from the calling to prayer to the invocation. No instruments are involved; only clapping sometimes occur. The listener becomes sensitive to the passionate quality of the singer and the gravity of the rite. This is not a field recording and there is no sense of community. I found the album rather arid and was not moved.Also featuring Mohamed al-Helbawy is the recording Egyptian Sufi [ARC]. The recording has more echo, or depth, and is clearer. Also, instruments are included: a kawala flute and drum. Here, the choir consists of four members; two others are musicians. Only hymns are offered; there is no sense of dhikr exercises as suggested in the above album. However, the superior quality of the engineering plus the addition of instruments make the album more inspiring, more effective. al-Helbawy seems stronger, richer in voice, too.The 2-CD alubm of Sheikh Admad al-Tuni, the Sultan of All Munshidin [Wagram] was recorded in Theatre de la Ville in Paris. He is accompanied by nine singers and musicans, who play oud, ney flute, kamanga violin, and drums (riqq, tabaleh, naqrazan). As cantor, al-Tuni has charisma in his voice. Bathing in the enveloping sound of the instruments, his phrasing and repetitions and has power (much like a flamenco singer...a historical offshoot). The songs are slow and meditative with oud improvisations leading to fast, rhythmic dancing. While a concert, there is dhikr spirit, as no doubt the audience must be swaying in their seats. Sam is manifest. These recordings are the best of the lot.

Of the many recordings of Sufi dhikrs, this is probably the best one to support the practice of rhythmic breathy exclamations, known to be efficacious via oxygenation and concentration. The solo voice of Sufi shaikh and clincal professor Or&uuml;j Guvenc and choral voices are accompanied by ud, ney, rebab, saz, and bendir instruments. The intimate recording differs from concerts of Turkish Mevalana groups The recording is infectious and our own breathing is tracked with the repetitious phrases. The somewhat slow pace and soft voicing is characteristic of Turkish and Syrian Sufi music. Above this ground soars the song of the ney flute. This powerful recording is worth a search to obtain a copy.

There is nothing new here; it is a compilation of Ivan Lins' recordings and some covers by Brazilian singers from 1970 to 1987. Nothing from the 1990s or this century are included. Lyrics are absent. With these caveats now put aside, the album is yet very worthwhile, for it shows the changes of Brazilian popular music over the decades (it began almost mimicking American styles) and the development of Lins talent in composing. Lins is a tunesmith. His lyricists are Vitor Martins and occasionally Ronald Monteirode Souza. Bringing the songs into shape is Gilson Perazzetta, his music arranger. Other than the earliest songs from the 1970s, which are almost painful to hear from their transitional style and engineering, Lins' tunes are beautiful and romantic. Eventually, American musicians discovered these works and brought them to our shores; George Benson, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Barbra Streisand, Herbie Hancock, Diana Krall, Dianne Reeves, Shirley Horn, The Crusaders, and many more have appreciated his writing. This album has two disks; the first is Lins' own recordings and the second has tracks from such singers as Gal Costa, Elis Regina, Faf&agrave; de Bel&eacute;m, and Zizi Possi, some in duets with Lins himself. This collection, along with his Latin Grammy-winning Cantando Hist&oacute;rias, offers a good overview of Lins' many years of songwriting.

Recently, Kayhan Kalhor, the kamencheh musician, whether in traditional style (as in "Faryad" and in "Night, Silence, Desert" with other Masters of Persian Music) or in experimental multi-ethnic collaborations (as with Ghazal's "The Rain"), has popularized Iranian music in Europe and the Americas. Another young composer who is bringing Persian music to a Western audience is Hafez Nazeri, who in 2000 founded the Rumi Ensemble. This album is a recording of the reconstituted group, which includes Hafez's father, the master Kurdish vocalist and intepretor of Sufi music, Shahram Nazeri. Instruments include the bowed kamecheh, barbat and seter, Persian lutes, and tombak, damam, and daf drums. This is powerful music. Hafez Nazeri, trained in both Persian and Western music, is an effective, innovative composer, and his father's passionately strong and subtle vocals are memorable. Whereas Sufi and Zen masters speak of don't-know mind, I do know that this is must-have album for world music lover and spiritual seeker alike.

Because the two discs are different in instrumentation, I should give two separate ratings. I prefer the first CD, Issachar, for the nonstandard classical trio of cello, violin, and bass -- the Massada String Trio. The East European Jewish riffs, minor scales, and dance rhythms are suggestive of klezmer celebrations and rabbinic laments. Zorn's compositions have the violin as chief melody instrument and cello as weaver of harmony and rhythm, the bass laying the rhythmic ground, which could be even a tango. Most tracks of this disc are lyrical, but several are a noisy pastiche with references to other musics, such as Bach, or with scraping and other sound effects. Attention never strays even when these effects become irritating, as intended. It is a fine suite of tunes. The trio become a sextet on the second CD, Zevulun, with additions of guitar, drum, and other percussion. No longer of the classical genre, the music approaches alternative rock. Jewish klezmer phrases continue here and there, but they do not dominant. Also, rhythms vary wildly with Latin influences. Although there is some wit in these compositions, they are overall shallow and less interesting or fulfilling for me. Thus, I give ***** for Disc 1, *** for Disc 2.

While this book may be small, it is loaded with information that any fan of flamenco music must have. Developed from first informal and then formal studies by the author with Gypsies [Roma] that led to a doctoral dissertation in 1980, this history is an eye-opener. Leblon traces the path of Gypsies from northwest India through Europe and finally to Spain, documenting how they took the role of musical entertainers that was nearly left vacant by religious and social injunctions on the indigenous populations. (Jews also served as musicians, especially in Muslim lands.) Their mobility was viewed as a threat to social order, particularly in Christian Spain, which has had a long history of intolerance. After the Jews, then the Muslims, and then the converted Muslims (who were trusted less than converted Jews) were forced into exile, Spanish authorities then placed a series of horrific restrictions from the 16th to the end of the 18th centuries against the Gypsies that make the American treatment of native tribes seem liberal, enlightened, and compassionate. A discussion on the specific origins of flamenco music itself ensues (as well as its name, derived, he concludes, from the Gypsies who fought for Spain in the Flemish war.) The book includes musical and historical comparisons with the gypsies of Hungary. Leblon's attacks on Spanish historical ignorance, although justified, does wear thin. As for the musical origins, details are obscure, though certain milestones are noted, and he ignores the adaptation of palmas (hand-clapping) and the characteristic foot-tapping dances entirely. The second part, an annotated list of 200 flamenco artists (musicians, dancers, singers), is itself a valuable reference; it provides stage and family names, relationships, and accomplishments. A glossary also is added. The student of flamenco will consult this book often. It is an important addition to ethnomusicology.

It is not rare for a classical composer to quote from well-known works of the past. De Falla's Beethoven 5th Symphony excerpt in the ballet El Sombrero de Tres Picos is one example. Thus when Carter Penn starts his fun homage to downhill skiing with Beethoven, it immediately brings forth a smile. Penn is featured in his own Naxos Wind Band Classics album. His composition is my favorite of this particular album and it alone justifies acquiring it. Jonathan Elkus's adaptation of Ives does nothing for me; the reason is not Ives's impressionism and dissonance but the limitations of a brass band and its sounding as if half-time on a football field. In contrast, the following Concerto for Flute and Wind Band by Michael Mower is concert hall jazzy, contemporary, and tropical, reflecting Mower's experience playing flute with a wide range of artists, from Gil Evans to Bj&ouml;rk, from Ryuichi Sakamoto to Tina Turner. David Fedele's flute performance is excellent and the concerto is rewarding. John P. Lynch, who directs the University of Kansas Wind Ensemble, has a brief and frankly forgetful religio-philosophical piece suggestive of a hymn. The last track is from John Mackey; it is full of spunk and ginger, starting out with a noisy gallop, settling into a surrealistic slow tango, and closing with a fast dive to the floor. This album, the first of the Naxos Series, demonstrates the richness and variety of modern music for wind ensembles.

Afro-sambas? Is that redundant, considering that sambas arose in part from Afro-Brazilian candombl&eacute; and other rites? Yes and no. Sambas stemmed from many influences, thus it is a matter of emphasis. Moreover, this music has also a strong bossa nova element, particularly in mood and tempo and softness. Here are set compositions by two amazing stars of Brazilian music, Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes. The songs refer to African gods and legends and the musical sources are sambas de roda, ponto de candombl&eacute;, and berimbau rhythms. One singer and one guitar bring beauty to these works. The lyrics in the insert are given in Portuguese only; and I therefore miss some quality of the performance. Relying solely on the voice and intensities of the guitar, I still sense the storytelling and spirituality. Track 7, Canto de Iemanj&aacute;, is particularly moving and the guitar work is powerful in sensitivity. This is a wonderful album that instills a sense of a tropical rainforest and its inhabitants.

Unconquered by the British in the 19th century, Afghanistan was an isolated, technologically antique nation until the Soviets invaded, were forced out, and American troops then arrived. LPs and tape cassettes were hardly known. Its music was more than the Hindustani popular forms imported to Kabul and broadcast by radio, whose range was limited. It reflected the land's many ethnicities, its religious rites, and the various ceremonies of life events, as weddings. From 1968 to the early 1970s, anthropologist Mark Slobin and his wife dwelled in Afghanistan with a tape recorder and obtained these coarse field recordings and photographs. I recently heard Slobin speak and viewed his Wesleyan University website that covers some of these materials. Afghanistan was a crossroads of the old Silk Road communicating with India and Persia and western China. Its musical instruments and styles were influenced by Persians and Central Asian peoples. In the 2-CD set we hear dutar, tambur, and dambura lutes; ghichak fiddle; various drums; finger cymbals; and flutes. We hear tea house folk songs, wedding songs, dances, a lullaby, classical pieces, and drum rhythms. Instead of polished professional orchestras, we hear common and also talented folk musicians of various ethnicities. This album is largely academic, for the ethnomusicogist and truly dedicated world music fan. These caveats aside, the music itself holds interest. The purity and rawness, the drum rhythms, the very musicianship take us to an exotic place at an earlier time. The insert is more than documentation; it educates with discussions, many photographs, and a chart.

Aside from the excellent recordings of some Bernstein's music performed by the outstanding Dave Brubeck Quartet, a collector wants certain information about the music and engineering as well as reflective commentary that normally appears on liner notes. WARNING: this latest edition [2009] from the Legacy group of SONY [Columbia] lacks any such information; the insert is essentially naked. Moreover, the list of tracks lacks timing and the sequence is WRONG! Thus, we do not know even when the quartet was in the studio to produce this album. The .mp3 generation could care less about such incidentals, but we audiophiles and collectors expect minimal details.....and accuracy! **** for the music; * for the packaging.

This anthology of Turkish music, taken from the catalogue of ARC, closes with Ensemble H&uuml;seyin T&uuml;rkmenler's dance piece so alluring that it appears in Rough Guide's own anthology. The music heard is more traditional, of folk dances and gypsy tunes, than either Putumayo's and Rough Guide's more popular collections. Although limited, the album of nearly one hour duration still is varied with songs and instrumentals, and the various musical groups and regional styles from the Aegean, the Black Sea, and Anatolian highlands keep our ears alert. T&uuml;rkmenler's ensemble dominates the selections. Because Turkish rhythms are strong and challenging, this album serves as a good introduction to this musical crossroads.

A reissue of a 2004 ARC release, now with a new cover, this excellent album of the traditional and composed music of Tunisia features a European-based ensemble of seven members playing Middle Eastern instruments: oud lute, qanaun zither, nay flute, sagat finger cymbals, and various drums: goblet darbouka, tambourine tar/riqq, frame duf, and snare frame bendir, plus bass and violin. The romantic music, with harmonic vocals, is lively, rich, and rhythmic. It is difficult not to dance, or at least sway to the beat. Package notes include the lyrics in translation; composers and original singers are cited. The pieces are in maqams, modes, including mazmoum, isbayin, hijaz qar, zankoulah, adjam oushayran, and kudri. These pieces are more popular Arabic than classical Andalusian in form, more traditional than contemporary. The fine, sonorous sound is thick and swirling. 59 minutes.[ARC is slowly reissuing its licensed albums, all with new cover art, as it is now distributed in the United States by Naxos. Therefore, expect to find various editions yet available.]

Bernie Krause has made a career of preserving the sound of endangered and some now lost environments. This particular CD is the 3rd reincarnation, now mastered in 24-bit surround, of a recording of a lake in Washington state in the relative quiet of early morning. We hear sequentially two perspectives, north and south lake, recorded at the same. It does make a difference. The sound of distant birds resounding along the lake provide a sense of spaciousness, and the plethora of bird species of the Pacific Northwest saturate the habitat. One creature seemed to have alighted on a branch just above the microphone and for a thankfully brief moment pierces the background with its loud, shrill call. A trout jumping out of the lake and splashing back is also heard. By and large, however, this is a fine recording that reminds me of my own exerience at a large reservoir in Oregon, too distant for jet traffic but an evening rest stop on an avian flyway. Someday soon we shall never hear such sounds devoid of human activity.

Bernie Krause has made a career of preserving the sound of endangered and some now lost environments. His diligence in developing the proper recording techniques provides us with a crystal clear and balanced album of a Sierra stream and its variety of nearby chirping birds. It can be compared to A Day on Cape Cod/Babbling Brook issued by Rykodisc. The mountain stream is somewhat more vigorous and the recording has a greater depth of sound from the rising terrain and broad meadow; of course, the bird species differ. The album has the fine qualities desired for an environmental recording, whether for easing the mind or reminding us of an enjoyable mountain hike. Krause tells us that this particular soundscape no longer exists because of logging.

Historically in the Far East, China is the superpower and primary cultural center. Chinese ideograms, Chinese administrative practices, and Chinese Buddhism spread to Korea and Japan. So did music and its instruments, beginning during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The royal courts of Japan and Korean emulated the music of the Chinese Emperor. Japanese court music, of which there are a fair number of recordings, is known as gagaku. This particular album is of Korean court music, which sounds similar, being slow and stately with use of the sho (a harmonica-like instrument), drum, and flutes, but with the komungo and kayakeum zithers, rather than the koto. Also, we hear the characteric Korean warble in voice and flute. I find the music somewhat less refined than gagaku, but it is likewise meditative. The sound quality of this old recording is good but not up to modern standards. By sound and musical pieces, a better recording of Korean court music from 1985 was issued by Playasound, France.

This album by Meredith Monk and Robert Een is one of their finest conceptions. The miminal use of pitch pipe (and on tracks of the second piece, piano and organ) coupled with their inventive vocalizations captures the cold and barren arctic, its icepack itself a minimal environment, and the sounds of breaking ice and the play of wind. Indeed, the spirit is not far from the joiks and atmospheric music of the Sami people of arctic Scandinavia. "Facing North" is in essence a clever tone poem that grew out of Monk's preparation of her opera Atlas. It includes humor in the fun tracks of "Keeping Warm" (the stomping in place to keep warm and Inuit-styled breath games) and "Arctic Bar" (images of a rustic wooden shack of whisky and boisterous patrons), whose rhythm and vocalise was adapted into a recent TV advertisement. The second composition, Vessel has undergone major reductions from its initial large scale, ad hoc experimental performances. Inspired by the saga of Joan d'Arc, the pastiche maintains its epic storytelling. The last section, "Boat Song" is taken from Recent Ruins and has the theme of archeology and origins of human behavior. We can feel the slow pulls of the oar. Monk is a conjurer, whose simple tunes and wild vocalise take us to familiar places of land and of the heart.

The editorial and the opinion of the Glasgow reviewer describe sufficiently this blissfully mellow yet varied CD, but as there is yet only one public review, I wish to concur that it would be a worthy purchase for anyone interested in contemporary Brazilian music firmly rooted in core samba. Bryne's thankfully brief and single incursion sticks out as a bump in the road, and contributes nothing but a distraction. Monte's voice is absolutely perfect for the gentle samba, and the arrangements, for added interest, are unusually complex in instrumentation, such as tuba, marimba, bell, ukulele, harp, theremin, and basson, while dispensing with the traditional heavy drum percussion. The inventiveness and sweetness endures through repeated listening (8 times already!). Great dinner and evening music. Buy it! 4 and 1/2 stars, actually, because of that Byrne blip.

This album is the first of, thus far, three in the Brasilianos series by the Hamilton de Holanda Quintet. It is the more rooted album, with baio, slow samba-caoa, and afro-samba. With the demands of speed and instrumental weaving, the musicians must be keen to each other's playing and accomplished in their art. The quintet are indeed that. Daniel Santiago's guitar work brings a soft counterpoint and harmony; Marcio Bahia's drums offer unusual accents and that strong Brazilian beat; Andre Vasconcellos electric bass broaden the sound against the treble of the mandolin; but Gabriel Grossi's harmonica is not used optimally; when present, it brings harmony and melodic emphasis. He would be a key element in their third album of the series, an album that moves deeper into free jazz with classical overtones. The mandolin of de Holanda is unusual by having 10 strings. This is akin to the that Brazilian guitar variation, the 10-string, open-tuned viola (not to be confused with the violin family). As far as the music is concerned, the album covers a variety of tempi and forms. Fast dances and virtuosic picking lead off, but there are also waltzes and a jazz ballad. One piece, Procession, is composed by Gilberto Gill. Brazilian classical composer Villa-Lobos is also acknowledged and quoted with track 7, Small Country Train. Homage is also paid to Maverick musician Hermeto Pascoal in the final track. I wish that broad umbrella of Musica-Popular Brasileira [MPB] not include jazz, though I must admit that jazz has influenced many popular styles. This group's music, in my book, is not pop or even popular style. It is far too sophisticated, too complex and intelligent. The rich symphonic sound of these instruments are a feast for the ear and the performances are outstanding.

The All Night Indian Concert of 1988 in Stuttgart, Germany, was a major event that produced many fine, exciting recordings. The one with Hariprasad Chaurasia and Zakir Hussain was especially worthy. So too in its own way is this album by Ravi Shankar, which presents two popular ragas of the morning. No alaps are offered, which either may have been edited out for this album or, more probably, may have not been included in Shankar's performance. (He is not really an alap specialist.) In any case, the first piece, Raga Bhatiyar, shoot outs like a racehorse and reaches the jhala finish line in 12-beat ektal. Kumar Bose provides the tabla support and I feel tired for him! Raga Sindhi Bhairvai, a playful and romantic raga of the late morning, unfolds in longer time, beginning with 6-beat dadra. Shankar allows himself a four-minute slow development before jumping into the gat. There is a ragmala feeling, as Shankar moves from one phase and mood to another. Bose has the opportunity for a 7-minute solo. And if the speed to the first raga's gat was eye-opening, then the fast 16-beat final section of this raga leaves us panting. Therefore, if you like your ragas hot and exciting and less meditative or contemplative, then this album is for you.

From Granada, the last capital of Moorish Spain, to Fes, Morocco, came a music in exile. Its classical performance tradition is of suites and particular modes and styles. In this album, however, the songs are adaptations and the suites are selected to provide a variety of modes and feelings. And such feelings! Amina Alaoui's beautiful voice entwines us and the orchestra of Ahmed Piro, noted for popular as well as classical formats, propels us to an exotic land. Sweetness and joy pervades. The interpretations of the melodies, some familiar to listeners of Moroccan la, are rich in detail. The orchestra and vocalists, including leader Piro, are excellent, but the inclusion of a four-stringed banjo and mandolin does raise an eyebrow. Hardly bluegrass! Well-recorded, the album will certainly leave the listener in good spirits and perhaps with fantasies of visiting this musically interesting nation.

Forr&oacute; is the name of a cluster of dance styles from the dry ranches and towns of Northeastern Brazil, though popularized further south in Rio de Janeiro. Its instrumentation of accordion, triangle, and sometimes drum and guitar has the sound and lively spirit of Lousiana cajon and Creole zydeco. Forr&oacute; recordings are not readily available in the United States. David Byrne's compilation of "Brazil Classics 3" offers, well, many classics. This particular anthology features six groups of musicians and comparatively more contemporary recordings. Many of the tunes are composed by Luiz Gonazaga, a pioneer of accordion form. The 20 tracks provide a great variety of substyles: baio, coco, rojo, quadrilha, xaxode. xote. This is fun and cheerful country music with simple 4/4 and 2/4 rhythms. If you regard Brazilian music as just bossa nova, samba, choro, Afro-Brazilian spiritual forms, and American-influenced popular music, listen to this album . . . and enjoy!

Abdel Aziz el Mubarak is a pop singer of Sudan, the nation south of Egypt, and he swings! Playing pentatonic scales and backed by a tight band who play, in addition to traditional Arab violins and drum, an accordian, bass and rhythm guitars, a saxophone, and bongo. The music we hear on this recording are happy dance tunes. Despite the contemporary aspects of the arrangements, the lyrics follow traditions, including classical forms of Arabic poetry. This music of Sudan is far from its northern neighbor but has a reggae, Cajun, Bollywood, downhome country rock feel. Huh? It is hard to place. I could say that it is a rock & roll variation of the Zanzibar style, but that probably will not help. I have little doubt, however, that you will like it and probably will be unable to resist getting up and move your body to the strong beats.

As I am old enough to remember those black and white and brightly hued Carmen Miranda movies on my TV, this singer for me was a touch of the exotic. Only later did I realize that her fun tunes and colorful, exaggerated costumes were to a large extent Hollywoodized. You will not find those stereotypic songs in this collection. These instead hark back to the late 1930s and 1940s and are Brazilian recordings for that population. It documents what got Hollywood interested. Sound engineering there and then were much to be desired and listening here, you feel like discovering some dusty archive. But the music itself takes you back to the transitional period of choro and samba, of romantic art deco and early modern. The On-demand CD-R lacks any liner notes, any history or perspective. This album enlarges the perception of this popular star and onetime symbol of Brazil [buy a banana you may see a legacy of her American act]. We can well understand why the title track, Q Que e Que a Baiana Tem, became a major hit, as did Alo..Alo..? and the samba Preto e Branco. If you enjoy music of early romantic eras, as that of Carlos Gardel of Argentina and Edith Piaff of France, and even Fred Astaire of the United States, this fine anthology is your time machine.

This anthology is an outstanding survey of the northern section of the so-called Silk Road, taking us from Turkey, Azerbaijan,and Iran, through Uzbekistan, southern Siberia, China, and finally to Japan, but not in order, as the CD set is organized instead by category of musical function and the localities seem random. Although there are significant gaps in the styles, and I particularly miss the sweet lyric songs of Kyrgyz women, the powerful mugham voice of Qasimov of Azerbaijan, and more examples of the kylkobyz fiddle of Kzakhstan, the set provides a fine introduction of the musics of inner Asia and particularly the instruments. A glossary of instruments is provided, but unfortunately their images are often lacking. All the examples are short by necessity, when many traditional pieces are far longer in duration. For the uninitiated, it will take repeated listening to distinguish the uniqueness of timbre and rhythm from one land to the other; but this similarity of sounds helps demonstrate the role of the trade routes in sharing instruments and styles, such that the Japanese biwa, the Chinese pipa, and the Arabic oud all are related. If you want to attain some feel for the musics of inner Asia, then certainly these disks will meet the requirement.

First, the chorus is not anonymous but the talented Optina Pustyn Male Choir of St. Petersburg, here a group of eight that sound twice their number. The choir was established in 1996 to preserve Russian church music, but this CD is of traditional folk songs, although several selections do have known composers. They were arranged mainly by the baritone of the group, Alexander Semyonov. Second, these songs really are beautiful. You will not dance to these pieces, as they are nostalgic, sad, and romantic, and the mood and tempo are fairly consistant. There is the pathos of the lonely steppe, of patriotism, of religious desire. The enclosed booklet includes the lyrics in English and in Russian.

Leading women jazz pianists, if I may generalize, are more imaginative and witty than their male counterparts. Often with classical training, their technique is well honed and there are more colors to their musical palette. Among contemporary artists, Jessica Williams is a pianist's pianist, who in John Cage fashion, can reach into the instrument to strum the strings like a zither, as occurs in the first track of this album, her well-known composition, The Sheikh. Gratitude was the first of a dozen of her albums I have acquired since, and now can look back to this 1994 opus with some perspective. When I heard it for the first time, on radio, I was amazed. It was clever and clearly different. And I was delighted. Now, I see the album as too much of good thing; all her cards were put on the table. It is also too even in tone. The album is not my favorite of her solo recordings, but it stands as a brilliant milestone, the seed for many elaborations and explorations. If you have come to appreciate Jessica Williams, say from her Live at Yoshi's volumes, then you must have this album.

With so few books on flamenco in English, we are fortunate to have Robin Totton's, for it is excellent in its insights and survey of flamenco's many forms, palos. A musician and scholar, he probes in turn the song, the dance, and the role and style of the guitar. He explains what makes a great rendition of each contributor. He clarifies the divergence in rhythmic accents of cantaor and guitarist in, for instance, the sole&aacute;, which had long challenged my grasp. Totton's observations on Spanish gypsy, or Cal&oacute;, culture support our understanding of this powerful art form. We learn not to focus on the melody but on the words, the emotions, and the rhythm. As in classical music's leider or art song, the artist's emphasis on the songs' poems is key to a fine performance. A glossary, including gypsy words, in included. We are also treated to a CD of 76 minutes that provide examples of the various palos. Most are recorded and discussed by the author and the sound is very good. He incorporates historical aspects of the music and the gypsies themselves. Photographs of performers also enhance this study. Thus, the book is a wonderful and worthwhile "introduction." But it is so thorough that I wonder what an advance book would be! If you listen to flamenco and wish to know more, find and buy this book. It will open your ears.

First, a word on the graphics of the album insert: Fun! When unfolded, a 14 11 inch image of the painting of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's The Wedding Dance, with additions of band members and their saxophone, trombones, trumpet, violin, accordion, mandolin, bass, and microphone is clever, and it also aptly projects the happy, celebratory spirit of this music. The band at this 1994 studio recording is up to 10 members, with 3 guests musicians. The album is nonstop joy. Lyrics are provided. Ballads and four reels uplift the heart. The sonority of brass and multiple instrumental arrangements give La Bottine Souriante a unique sound to the folk instruments and approach to traditional French Canadian music. (The effect and style reminds me of old rock's big band sound of Tower of Power, Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Chicago.) Track 9, La Complainte du Fokloriste, is a lyrical instrumental, and I wonder what amusing lyrics could be applied to it. This album continues to demonstrate why the band is so popular. Their live recording may be even better for capturing their energy, but this album is still exceedingly good.

It is good that this set of classic choros are again available; I had purchased them in 1991 and 1994 when bluegrass mandolinist David Grisman first issued them. Choros, a unique musical form known for is speed, virtuoso solos, and tight ensemble work, arose in late 19th and early 20th centuries and is having its second renaissance. It is a form that refuses to disappear. With its sometime syncopation and its 16th notes in 2/4, choros resemble ragtime and is equally joyful and rhythmic. In its early years, it was performed informally by a trio or quartet of flute or bandolim (Brazilian mandolin) , 7-string guitar or guitars, and pandeiro (Brazilian tambourine), but by mid century, large formal bands and orchestras were playing choros. Among its greatest stars was Jac&oacute; do Bandolim (Jacob Pick Bittencourt), who lived between 1918 and 1969, and composed 130 pieces, many of which are still performed. One of his most popular appears on Volume 2, Noites Cariocas (1957). The two volumes consist of recordings between 1952 and 1966. I personally prefer Volume 1 but both are excellent. Listening to these works, you can appreciate why he was a popular musician and band leader: he has incredible dexterity, improvisational skills, and a talent for harmony. Today many samba bands include choros. If you obtain these albums, you will understand why.

World music percussion ensembles playing diverse improvisations are hardly new. The pioneering recording of the Diga Rhythm Band, with its 11 members, was followed quickly by Zakir Hussain's Rhythm Experience and Mickey Hart's Planet Drum groups (both members of Diga). Spoken Hand's 17 percussionists carry on that spirit with batteries of Afro-Cuban bata, Brazilian samba, Indian tabla, and West African djembe percussion. Individual batteries and their interplay provide a fun recording. Vocalizations occur throughout. It is the great variety of sound, mood, and rhythm that make this a thoroughly satisfying album and sets it apart from similar recordings. I need to emphasize that this is not an anthology but the work of one group. The high energy, the preserved root forms, the clever improvised arrangements all demonstrate the calibre of this well-polished orchestra. Indeed, they had once collaborated with Zakir Hussain in a concert performance. If you are fan of world percussion, this album must be among your collection.

Nikhil Banerjee was the yin to Ravi Shankar's yang. Both were students of Allaudin Khan, and Banerjee continued his studies under the guidance of Khan's son, Ali Akbar Khan. While Shankar prefers the razzle-dazzle and vigor of the gat, Banerjee is at home in the slow unfolding of the meditative alap. This album's first raga, Chandrakaush, while limited to merely 20 minutes, allows full appreciation of its unusual pentatonic scale and late night mood. Banerjee's improvisations are beautiful and lyrical. He performs this work solo, but in the second raga, Khamaj, he is joined by Mahapurush Misra, a brilliant tablist who helped make Ali Akbar Khan's Connoisseur/Signature Recordings so memorable. The selected rhythm cycle for the first gat is rupak tal, seven beats, and then closes with 16-beat teental. This often played raga of the early evening is ligher, more romantic in mood than the deep spiritual feeling of the first piece. Together, they provide an album of greatness. Now, consider this: these ragas were recorded live-to-air on the radio in the USA in 1967. Historic in many ways.

Despite my extensive studies of mid 19th-century biology, wherein Ernst Haeckel was often mentioned, I knew very little about his life and philosophy. Thus, this 60-minute documentary was revelatory. The film ably presents the religio-philosophical background of natural science at the time and the various discoveries that had begun to challenge and change this perspective. Art, science, technology, and religion weave in and out and merge, making the film unusually multidisciplinary. The use of contemporary illustrations--photographs, watercolors, and etchings--provides a feeling of the novelty and excitement of Haeckel's explorations and discoveries. The radiolaria crystalline skeletons of such great variety, like snowflakes, are fascinating, especially when viewed as a rapid animated series. The later expansion of Haeckel's worldview, grounded in Spinoza and Goethe, is evidenced by his later treatises and landscape paintings from his many world travels. The film was a 20-year project of David Lebrun; his labors in cinematography in an era before electronic graphics, as explained in bonus features, are itself extraordinary, as much a technological divide as an old manual typewriter and 'white-out' versus modern computerized wordprocessing. A cohesive soundtrack was provided by composer Yuval Ron plus sound effects. Thus, the film is a worthwhile though esoteric documentary. For a related book, see: "Exploring the Invisible. Art, science, and the spiritual" by Lynn Gamwell.

Whereas Tibetan music within China is being influenced by Han Chinese instruments, inflections, and popular styles, the Uyghur music within China's Xinjiang region remain steadfast to its Persian-Turkic roots. In this recording, we hear Central Asian instruments, the plucked two silk-stringed, soft-toned dutar and the five bright-toned, metal-stringed tambur, the bowed satar, various drums and shrill, reeded surnay, a shawm or oboe. Styles of playing are from northern and easter Xinjiang, although their muqam origin lies in the southwest, in Kashgar. This is an excellent CD; its music and the instrumental design can be studied and compared to the music and instruments of the Central Asian nations to the west, such as found in the series of Smithsonian-Aga Khan Trust recordings. Those who are interested in the Silk Road and its spread of music will particularly appreciate this album; the combination of oboe and drums is also found in the folk music of Ladakh, India, near Tibet. And for those who enjoy exploring unusual music from little known lands, you, too, will be pleased with this CD.

Before discussing this particular disc, I need to note that the duo of piano and mandolin needs to be heard more often. The contrast of timbre delights the ear, and there is something cheerful about the sound of a mandolin. That said, I find that Mike Marshall and Jovino Santos Nero are splendid musicians, but I find the overall arrangements of these works by Hermeto Pascoal are the direct opposite associated with the wild man of Brazil, that is, tame and mellow. The guest appearance of Pascoal on flute on track 2 indicates the difference in style. Santos Neto is well familiar with these selected works because he performed for 15 years with Pascoal's group and is curator of his over 2,500 compositions. Marshall, who came from bluegrass, later mastered the choro. For a listener who is challenged by the intensity and oddness of many of Pascoal's recordings, this album will be comfortable, for it is rich in melody and smooth in sensation. Perhaps too much so at times. Track 4, "July 14" stands out with its interesting jagged rhythm, and track 8, Tertulia, has a tango-like urgency, but the general tone of the album subdues these highlights. For instance, the final track, Santa Catarina, has a playful fast Bach-like introduction but rapidly melts into a slow current of notes. However, we should differentiate Pascoal as avant-garde performer versus his being composer, and these musicians were more concerned with the score and the lovely tunes. Serenata is a fine album, but I would prefer some more spunk. Others may be attracted to the relaxed style.

Before Genticorum, before Le Vent du Nord, there was La Bottine Souriante. They began as the mentioned traditional folk groups of Quebec, that is, a small handful of talented musicians, but today they are an institution with a large band that includes piano, horns, and dancers and a bevy of foot tapers. I saw a short video of a concert performance and was amazed by their energy and verve. This was not an intimate coffee house group but a mass audience frolic. Naturally, I desired to obtain a live recording, and this album of a 1996 event, where they perform some of their popular tunes from their studio albums going back to 1978, accomplished that nicely. While I truly enjoy the pure small folk group sound, this jazzy big band treatment is so joyous that you cannot but share in the enthusiasm of both audience and band. There is not a bad or indifferent track. The sonority of trombones and trumpet, the sweetness of accordion and harmonica, the tapping of feet and drum and piano, the melody-making of violin and guitars, and the unique vocal sound of Canadian French: fun stuff!

This is the finest book on the sociological basis of music I have ever read. Many good books will provide a new fact on each page or two, but I seem to learn three new bits of history on every single page of this extensive analysis of the origins of musical styles in Cuba. But this is more than about Cuba; it is about Al-Andalus/Sefarad and Renaissance Spain and the eary history of the United States, and about northwest and central African peoples, and about Renaissance Europe, and about the early history of Islam and Arabia. It is about differing social policy and its effect on the slave trade. It is about what gave New Orleans jazz the Latin tinge and makes that city a treasure. It is about the distinct origins of the polyrhythmic, polytonal structures of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian music and the recitative, glissando-embellished, monorhythmic music of the blues and later jazz. We learn about Louis Gottchalk's first use of the African drum in classical music [performed in Europe] and why such instruments were banned in England's continental colonies and the early United States since 1739. We learn how Moorish, that is, black, line dance style was once the rage of western Europeans, and led to England's Morris dances. These are among the smallest of factoids that you will encounter reading this highly readable yet scholarly book.Because I admire and particularly enjoy multidisciplinary cultural histories, Sublette's book is a feast. His explorations are ours. You will be fascinated, and you will be delighted. The book is an education. Buy it.

Several albums of music from the Aissawa Brotherhood in Morocco are available and all are different. This is because the Brotherhood is divided among various tayfa communities, of which in the city of F&egrave;s alone number around 20. Each tayfa may specialize in a different form of the practice, and instrumentation and voicing can vary. This recording from France's famous Ocura label is outstanding. It is both intimate and extroverted, depending on section of the rite. The album commences with the hizb, the recitation or more properly chanting of prayers. Indeed, for the early section it is remarkably much like Korean Buddhist chanting, before it shifts into typical Arabian call-and-response mode. The second section is again a capella; it is the dhikr. After preliminary hymnal singing, it moves into a rhythmic form, achieved with the aid of small, cylindrical drums, tarija, and frame drums, bendir. The essay and discussion within the package notes informs us that a portions of the dhikr and later mlouk sections do not appear in the recording; both involve movement practice, a swaying and dance, which coupled with the hymnal singing and percussion, can induce the alternative consciousness of "remembering", a mystical unifying experience. The third section, mlouk, may have borrowed something from the gnawa. Here the shrill ghayta/zhurna oboe dominates and individual and group movement, essentially a dance, is involved in trance. The movie, Meetings with Remarkable Men, which takes place in the mountains of Central Asia, has a scene akin to this form of abandon dancing. Ten members of the Brotherhood, led by Sheikh Sidi Mohamed, are involved in this recording from 2001. 61 minutes.

This is music that defies categories. New Music is how the classical world often describe such experiments. The wind ensemble gives evidence for that genre, except this is also much like a rock opera of a spiritual quest. (Classical vocalise maverick Meredith Monk, too, had a quest opera, Atlas.) I could also describe it as far out alternative world fusion. Indeed, track 1 begins with something like the deep horns of Tibet, announcing the start of the protagonist's adventure, and soon chorus and melody resemble Javanese music in structure. The hollow sound of beer bottle flutes, much like the traditional tube flutes of many indigenous peoples, enhance the character's first dream. The track Ponds & Puddles has a mbira-like metallophone. Text metaphors include Aztec Mexico and Australia. The music when the protagonist accepts the journey itself as the goal is alternative rock with drum percussion. Maracas and marimba next suggest Latin America, but in this second dream sequence the Gettyburg battlefield guide is Sacagawea, and romance ensues. The quest ends in the reality of the parking lot, the common world, seen from a new perspective. Here, sorpranos and harmonic reeds, saxophone dominant, mark the event. My main criticism is that I was distracted by the jerky electronic programming on a couple tracks. Other than that, the listener may enjoy the textual images and the poetic lyrics. This is indeed a musical adventure. ****1/2

This live recording of classical Arabic music by a chamber ensemble, called takht, features the vocalist Aicha Redouane accompanied by qanun zither, ud lute, kaman violin, and riqq drum. This is essentially art music. The variety of instrumental timbre plus the very fine vocal phrasing and ornamentation have the objective to produce tarab, a high emotional state in both performer and listener. You need not be a connoisseur of the maqam scale or various rhythms in these suites to appreciate the beauty of the sound and Redouane's pure, clear voice and her vocal improvisations. The Institut du Monde Arabe in France had issued a large number of recordings in their survey of Arabic music, many of them superb, and perhaps someday the institute will again make them available. Meanwhile, you may search for it among Amazon's sellers and be rewarded with this perfect example of the art of Arabic music that developed in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century.

I have been fortunate to hear Americana, that peculiar hodge-podge term of new and alternative country and folk music, which encompasses Bob Dylan and Neil Young and banjo pickin' Bill Evans, from my radio, as KPIG transmits from up the hill (the first web radio station, by the way). This compilation CD is a fairly good sampling of the flavor of the genre. However, it just touches the surface and lacks some of the irreverence for authority and challenging humor. If anything, the anthology should induce a desire to hear more. Interesting in what is available here is Norah Jones in full country mode with The Little Willies before she went to significant solo career. My favorite selection is Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show, which makes you want to drive, drive, drive with a smile on your face.

An 80-minute rare rag for early evening with an alap-jor of 26 minutes (longer than most recorded ragas): this live recording of a performance in Munich, Germany, in 1980 affords the proper measure of time in which Nikhil Banerjee, a grand master of sitar, can seriously explore a lovely raga. Raga Malgunji has many of the elements of the Shri family of ragas, particularly Rageshri and Bageshri, and as we listen, nay, absorb this peaceful, romantic raga, we feel joy and marvel in the improvisations. The young Anindo Chatterjee envelopes the gat, the final sections, with his tabla, incisively playing the common 16-beat teental rhythms, slow and fast. The album is as good as it gets, and if you are devotee and collector of Indian classical music, it belongs on your shelf.

'Tis a pity that these quartets (Volume 1 and 2, Naxos) of Neilsen are not included in the repertoire of the many quartets that frequent the Bay Area. They are certainly romantic and lyrical and complex of interplay and rhythm as the better known romantic composers. Indeed, while I have seen all of Neilsen's symphonies and his violin concerto performed, I, like many other reviewers, had no knowledge of these quartets until Amazon's recommendation algorithm led me to them. Although the earlier quartets lack the great tension or theme that engages us fully, Op. 44 is rich in mood (e.g., the Adagio con sentimento religioso) and symphonic in sweep. It is mature and well-developed, acknowledged by Neilsen himself, and truly delightful. I personally find Neilsen's first quartets a parade of musical statements, each movement interesting but not satisfying in the whole. Op. 13, with its thematic recapitulation, does attempt to string the units together. The Oslo Quartet (and their sound engineers) give us very worthy albums. Budget priced, these recodings should be included in your classical collection, but if you desire to purchase only one CD, then select this Volume 1.

This particular recording of the French Playasound budget Air Mail Music series focuses on Java and the suling bamboo flute. It is performed with a small gamelan ensemble or a tinny kecapi zither (akin to the Chinese qin) in duo. The kecapi and suling combination is popular in West Java. Recorded in 1999, the sound is excellent with a rich bass gong marking the end of musical divisions on the gamelan tracks. Limited by the 5 or 7 notes of the two common scales, traditional Javanese music has simple melodies often assembled as suites. The steady rhythms support stately flowing dances. While they share with Javanese court music slow, meditative fluidity, these pieces do not develop nor is there any cresendo or rapid closing. The 52 minutes of the album are of harmony and peace with a touch of jauntiness.

La Koro Sutra is probably the most popular of Lou Harrison albums. Hearing it on radio in 1988, I was stunned by its majestic spiritual beauty, its rhythms, its choral melodies, even its Esperanto version of the Buddhist Heart Sutra. The sound was entirely new but I recognized the Indonesian influence. It is like an oratorio composed of eight sections. The metallophone gamelan was not of traditional instruments but manufactured from junkyard metal. The second piece, a largely percussive trio with haunting violin lyricism and dance rhythms, is followed by a violin suite with gamelan that was later adapted for string orchestra [See: Suite for Violin, New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Koch]. This is a brilliant composition that reflects Balinese dance; the final Chaconne brings this album to a remarkably sweet conclusion. This recording was my first Harrison album (and among my very first CDs during that LP transition period); I am pleased that it is still available. If you wish to explore the works of Lou Harrison, begin here.

John Luther Adams composes space. John Luther Adams composes silence. John Luther Adams composes the vastness of Alaskan wilderness, its ice fields, its stark mountains, its emptiness, its light. Most of his albums employ a drone or a slow repeated flowing of strings and widely spaced chordal arpeggios, sometimes by strings, sometimes by harp or percussive celeste, vibraphone, or marimba. These albums are atmospheric without electronics and classical rather than New Age. Some albums employ nature sound samples, some have the rumbling of drums or the reviberation of bells. This early recording from 1993 is typical of his unique sound; however, it is different by its performance of a chorus and soprano soloist, heard in the second track. The mood is of a nocturne. Adams' music envelops the listener in tranquility and contemplation or meditation. Less abstract the Feldman, Adams' works are poetic and cinematographically representative, using the psychologically based musical idioms developed over the decades. Thus, if you have never found yourself alone in a silent desert of sand or ice, this recording will take you there in spirit.

Gigi (Ejigayehu Shibabaw) and Bill Laswell have carved out a unique and wonderful niche: Ethiopian jazz. In the 1960s, Ethiopian traditional music was infused with funk, and for a decade its music scene flourished in dance clubs. Since then, after internal strife and wars, Ethiopians and Eriteans are in diaspora, taking with them their music. Many have gone the pop path, some have maintained their traditions, but as the album Gigi and this later album demonstrate, jazz and world fusion are a fertile approach. This music swings; it also induces trance, as many tracks are ritualistic. It keeps its heart in tradition with Ethiopian instruments--the washint flute, the kirar harp--and the popular accordion and saxophones and guitars, plus keyboards and various percussion and clapping. The arrangements are outstanding, full of vitality and charm, such as Track 3, Alesma. Gigi sings in Amharic and the older language Agew&ntilde;a. Many of the tracks are spiritual or romantically rooted to the land, others dance in the sky. Four are traditional tunes; Shibabawa wrote the remaining six. The sound engineering is first rate. This beautiful, heart-felt music will open your ears and cast your eyes to the horn of Africa to ancient, Biblical Abyssinia. 53 minutes.

Sardinia is the island immediately south of Corsica in the Mediterranean, west of Italy, but do not assume that the music would be similar. In fact, Sardinia was more a Mediterreans crossroads and has had influences from its North African neighbors and Byzantine traders. Thus, the first track of this anthology song by Rosa Resolza is clearly influenced by Moorish Spain, while the following track featuring the launeddas, a very ancient reed instrument with three pieces, including a drone, sounds Italian. The launeddas sounds like a bagpipe, but there is no bag and circular breathing is used instead. Polyphonic a cappella singing is a hallmark of Corsica, but Sardinia has its own version, essentially a vocal form of launeddas music. Other selections are modern compositions with various world instruments, traditional ballads, and religious tunes. This album is an excellent introduction to the music of Sardinia and its national instrument, the launeddas.

The ethnographer author of The Hundred Thousand Fools of God, who took us on a musical journey to Uzbekistan, truly enters new sonic territory with this account of traditional and developing Tuvan musical arts, including his fostering (as executive producer) of the group Huun-Huur-Tu. More than associating the various forms of throat singing with ambient environmental sounds, Tuvan music is based on timbre, not pitch, on relative intervals, not absolutes. Such a radical alteration of musical perspective requires new ways of listening, and here Levin helps us with a most interesting and well-written book and CD and, on the flip side of the disk, DVD. Instead of a deadly tedious textbook with some artificial, meaningless taxonomy and pages of scores, we are presented with a fascinating, lucid exploration that made me re-listen to my collection of Tuvan and Manchurian music with more appreciation and understanding. This book expanded my mind.

This is straightforward Iranian classical music beginning in the avz abouata, one of the seven main modes, and with further developments in the modes shur and nav. The master musicians are Hossein Alizdeh, who plays the various lutes called tr, tanbur, and s&eacute;tr; Madjid Khaladj on the tomak and daf drums; and Afsneh Rass'i, who has a strong, fluid voice in her rendition of poetic song. It is a beautiful recording that builds momentum and mood. Musique de monde recordings from Buda, France, are often of high calibre and this album certainly is superior.

Central African, Yoruba and Bantu, music from slaves had merged with Portuguese and European dance forms in the creation of choro and samba mainly in the southern cities of Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo, but in the northeast, the African idioms remained strong and more intact. Among the Afro-Brazilian styles is the rhythmic accompaniment to a martial dance exercise, capoeira, where acrobatic movements of feet and low torso are emphasized (which in turn led to break dancing in the United States and now everywhere). The berimbau, a stringed long bow and gourd instrument, the drum, and the gourd rattle are the instruments, in addition to hand clapping, of this dance art. While its origin was the need for defensive fighting, capoeira entered the mainstream as a unique dance and even incorporated various martial movements from Asia. The insert includes the lyrics in Portuguese, French, and English, which praise master teachers, support of saints, capoeira itself, and experiences in other lands. The music is often improvisational in the form of toques. This album also include the music to another martial dance, maculele, of obscure celebratory Catholic and African roots that involves participants striking sticks together in a form of fencing. Each member has a pair of sticks for use in duels. Instruments are mainly percussive, such as pandeiro tambourine and atabaque conical Conga drum and double bell agogog, but may also include a 12-string guitar. One track is purely instrumental, a samba de roda of two berimbaus and pandeiro. A glossary to 37 terms is provided. This album has fulfilled a niche in my Brazilian music collection. Its very African sound help enrich understanding of Brazil's musical culture. For the capoeira practitioner the album will support the dance and exercise.

The first reviewer's overview of the entire output of Camar&oacute;n de la Isla and Paco de Lucia is excellent and I have little to add. This early recording was when the artists were young (look at the photograph on the album!) and still rooted in the traditions. de Lucia's radical jazzy and popular innovations would come later. Even so, these recordings were regarded at the time as evolutionary. They already were taking flamenco into modernity. The remastering makes the album sound newly minted. As for the performances, few would contest their greatness. This is powerful stuff. Brilliant guitar work, passionate vocals. It is any wonder why in all the traditional restaurants and flamenco clubs I visited in Andalusia there is a photograph or painting of Camar&oacute;n in place of honor? It is a pity that the album is so short in duration. A double album or a multi-disc set would make better sense. Instead, we must set our player for "replay" so that we can listen further and deeper and enjoy some of the best flamenco you can find. It is brujo, magic.

Recorded in 1979 and 1980, when Albania was still terra incognita for Americans (see the movie, Wag the Dog), Marcel Cellier took his Nagra recorder to this country sandwiched on the Adriatic between Greece, Bulgaria, and Balkan Macedonia and made a discovery of rare musical idioms that you can share by listening to this unusual album. While influenced somewhat by Turkish, Slavic, and Greek musical forms over the ages, Albania music is essentially folk, rural, and ancient. Polyphony and drones characterize it. An ensemble of flautists, as seen on the cover, produce a mesmerizing sound that must be as old as the hills. Other instruments presented are reeded flutes, fiddle, two-stringed lute, and frame and double-headed drums. Two-part and four-part choral pieces are also found here among the 16 diverse examples. If you want to hear Euro-Asian music that defies simple categorization, investigate this album and step back in time.

Many albums of Blind Lemon Jefferson's music are available and sound quality vary. The Yazoo issues, often are superior, but I found the lowering of pitch increased the hiss in this instance. This Grammercy compilation has simpler digital mastering, but the effect is of authenticity, as if listening through an old radio of 1925 to 1929, the years of his discography. Although the sound is in the treble range and thin, his guitar, strumming and picking, is very distinct. The package notes are minimal. Tracks include the popular Match Box Blues and Black Snake Moan, but Rambler Blues, the talking blues Hot Dogs, the guitar work of One Dime Blues, and an early version of Corinna/Rider are of interest. Jefferson, who came from Texas, is regarded as a key pioneer of country blues.

Until this album, Coptic liturgical music was available only in poor quality field recordings; the better recordings are out of print. The Coptic community organized in 1975 a traveling choir of men and women to bring their music to wider attention, and here we hear the results of a recording in a Cairo studio. The 74-minute album lacks church ambiance and the performance does not match the spirit of a ritual in presence of the congregation, but the clarity of sound permits musicological appreciation. The Coptics of Egypt, who trace their Christian order to 43 A.D., are among the earliest monastics, who dwell among the desert mountains. With the rise of Islam and various empires, their history has mainly been one of externally dictated exclusion from Egyptian politics and citizenry. Its music has likely been influenced by Greek, Byzantine, and Arab Syriac forms built upon a pharonic foundation. Some hymns are Arabic in style, some are song in Greek. The masses [of Saint Basil, of Saint Gregory of Naziance, and of Saint Kyrillos] are sung homophonically. The only instrument in this recording is a metallic ring (a naqus) struck to mark divisions in sections or to provide some rhythm. The soloist is Ibrahim Ayad; the choir director is George Kirollos. The 12 tracks are slow and dignified. As the melodies are somewhat similar and modal, the emphasis is on phrasing and call-and-response. The final three tracks, for 24 minutes total, are solo chants for Passion week, a dedication for the Patriarch, Pope Chenuda III, and an Easter chant, and they try the patience of the listener, though their timeless quality may arise. Some earlier chants, which are more interesting with choir, are associated with processions, and by these more rhythmical tracks we can easily imagine the priest and deacons move about the church. This unusual, unique recording will be appreciated especially by those interested in sacred music and Middle Eastern studies.

This well-engineered recording, made by distinguished ethnomusicologist Ted Levin, earned a Grand Prix International du Disque, and it captures remarkably well the spirit of Fes, Morocco. Accompanied by the traditional instruments of oud (lute), violin, terr (frame drum), derbouka (globlet drum), rebab, and nay (flute), the vocalists sing religious poetry as part of a spiritual practice. This music is not intended for entertainment but to aid the musician and listening participant in reaching divine unity. Indeed, the poems have as themes divine unity, divine intoxication, divine love, and the recollection of Allah. In many ways, it shares the quiet meditative power of other Sufi music, such as the dervishes of Turkey, and incorporates the holotropic, oxygenating breathing exercises that may lead to ecstasy. At the same time, the vocal and instrumental style is firmly rooted in medieval Andalusia. I have heard such music in Fes during a dhikr, and listening to the recording transports me to its medina. If you are curious about Morocco, its religious music, or Sufism in general, you will find that this CD would be a worthwhile addition to your collection.

With duration of 78 minutes, this album of McKay's middle period compositions, 1940 to 1962, presents his more vigorously classical works: a concerto, an orchestra suite, and a sinfonietta, plus a encore piece of high merit. As with the previous issue of this particular Naxos series, the National Radio Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine under the baton of John McLauhlin Williams provides the performance. Compared in structure to Bruch's own violin concerto, this piece's first section is dramatic, followed by a slower contemplative movement, and ends with a fast, rhythmic dance. The lyrical phrases of Brian Reagin's violin are sumptious and the duet with a single flute has its charm. The hymns are those of Louis Bourgeois (c. 1510-1561), and McKay originally composed his pieces for organ. In the string version, they are pleasant and well-crafted but I find nothing special. They are slow and meditative and only with the fifth cortege does the suite become alive. The jagged energy that begins the three movement Sinfonietta No. 4 falls away to a middle pastoral of gentle themes and cloudlike moods; the work closes with light-hearted skipping and jumping, a joyful frolic...and did I heard Rocky and Bullwinkle? The final selection is Song Over the Great Plains, an atmospheric or poetic work with piano that speaks of open lands, climatic power, confidence, and endurance. The piano has the final word in a cadenza and fading pianissimo.

Pansori is part storytelling, part opera, for a singer-narrator and drum accompaniment. Performed in the open or sometimes the concert hall, the art is in the dramatic expressiveness and vocal intonations and inflections, with only a fan as prop. The percussionist, playing a puk (a sideways barrel drum), will provide vocal encouragement at particular moments (akin to the flamenco ol&eacute;). Although there are 12 pansori pieces, all related to Confucian principles, only five are presently performed. The one on this album is Simchong-ga, which concerns the relationship of child to parent. The package insert fully describes the plot that involves a young daughter, Simchong, of a blind man who sacrifices herself to restore her father's sight but who is not only redeemed by the Heavenly Emperor but becomes Empress. Very few recordings of pansori are available and this 53-minute full performance is exceptional. Traditional Korean singing, including Buddhist chants, has a distinctive warble with strong, deep force. It is inherently dramatic. With this base, the storytelling becomes even more intense though it has quiet, soft sections. Pansori is stage art, but this audio recording does impart the flavor.

Vasant Rai was the final student of Allauddin Khan, grand guru of Ali Akbar Khan, Ravi Shankar, and Nikhil Banerjee. His main instrument was the sarod; he also played flute, acoustic guitar, and his own modified guitar. I first encountered the LP recordings of Rai on the Vanguard label during the 1970s, where he had a couple short solo albums and some jazz fusion work with members of Oregon and the Winter Consort. And soon he was tragically gone at age 47. A recent concert release on the Raga label and this album from Oriental Records provide longer and more traditional examples of his art. Rai emphasized the lyrical of the raga scales and he played the sarod with strong, crisp technique. This later recording has Alla Rakha on tabla, and together they perform raga Goud Sarang, an early afternoon piece of the mansoon season filled with joy, contentment,and tenderness; raga Jaijaivanti of the late evening with a mood of calmness and prayer (with a bhajan lilt); and a final folk melody, a sweet dhun. A great tablist, a great sarodist, excellent sound, and interesting, joyful ragas make this album a collector's gem.

Originally issued by Lyrichord Records in 1975 and now available on Rounder, this album of Yemeni songs performed by the Kawabani brothers features oud and riqq tambourine and sometimes qanan zither and bongo-like double drums. Call-and-response with oud is featured with the steady treble of the drums and clangling cymbals of the riqq. In contrast to some other Yemeni albums that feature dances of heavy drumming, this recording is only vocal. The simple melodies and rhythms are straightforward and largely consistent throughout the album. One track is a quat-chewing song and was recorded in a room dedicated to the herb; indeed, the singer in this instance has a wad of the leaf within a cheek. Although the selections come from various regions of Yemen, any distinctions are not obvious. To my ears, the music here is more Arabian than what one expect from an ancient trade crossroads.

This oldie environmental recording may lack some of the better electronic audio processing of similar albums, but, for me, it is the most comfortable, fuller, and warmer. It may simply be a compatible set of frequencies. The 60-minute brook and environment are even in tone, with only occasional and distant forest sounds: normal and critter-induced breaking of tree branches and a bird chirp or two. I once owned a copy but foolishly sold it. Becoming disenchanted by recent brook babbling albums, I longed for my former possession; hence this purchase. Listening anew, it is better than I had hoped or remembered. The elderly Ryko album is a good choice. Apparently, the label's own on-demand reissue.

Heggie is the composer of a new opera based on Moby Dick, performed recently in San Francisco. His previous acclaimed opera was Dead Man Walking. Curious about his other works, I encountered this group of art songs presented by such operatic lights as Ren&eacute;e Fleming, Sylvia McNair, Frederica von Stade, Jennifer Larmore, Brian Asawa, Niccole Foland, Zheng Cao, Emil Miland, Kristin Clayton, and Carol Vaness. The source material is Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sir Phillip Sydney, and other poets (including von Stade herself). Heggie himself plays the piano throughout. The package insert includes the poems. Born in 1961, Heggie's lyricism is romantic and bright with contemporary sensitivity to the old poems. There is beauty and joy, humor and blue notes, shimmering reflections and gliding dances. This album has a taste of Broadway and winking parody, too. So varied in its approaches, so well sung and played, and at a bargain price, the album is, well, fun. If you are a Broadway musical fan, you may enjoy this traditional classical style. If you are a devotee of classical vocal art, then certainly put this album on your list. It is lovely. What is remarkable about Heggie was that he was "discovered" by von Stade, as he was working in the press office of the San Francisco Opera. She liked his songs and opened the gates for him.

Hasids are of the mystical branch of Judaism, akin to the Islamic Sufi. Besides Talmudic study, a key vehicle is song with dance, which are essentially breathing, sound vibration, and movement meditations. From an encounter with the Lubavitcher order and Reb Meanchem Schneerson and participation with folksinger Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, Mike Tabor carries on the musical tradition, particularly the nigunim, the soulful melodies from the European diaspora that are sung in the main as vocalise that can last for long durations, well beyond the shortened examples on this album. This music, not what you may have heard on recordings of Jewish or Yiddish folk songs, probes deeper into the ethos of the Jewish people. Joyous and melancholic, processional and ecstatic, even defiant, Tabor's music, played on bouzouki, violin, and recorders, supported by three other musicians playing a wide variety of instruments from Arabic oud and riqq to guitars, cello, and flute, conveys a different aspect of the Jewish tradition. I once attended a wedding performed by Shlomo Carlebach and am pleased that Mike Tabor carries on the good work.

Having been listening to the Asian jazz of Nguyn L, I returned to my copy of the Murasaki Ensemble's album Magenta and was still pleased. A local Bay Area group led by Shirley Muramoto on koto with Alex Baum on bass, Matt Eakle on flute, Jeff Massanari, guitar, and Vince Delgado's varied ethnic percussion, their light-hearted, lyrical melodies are somewhat akin to Andreas Vollenweider's New Age jazz but are more mainstream jazz with a Japanese flavor. The group produced only a couple albums in the mid 1990s, but they still perform from time to time. [Murasaki and the other musicians also play independently with other groups.]

What amounts to a prequel to Thomas Turino's Music in the Andes, which covers contemporary musicians and their instruments, is the book of ethnoarchaeomusicology by Dale Olsen, who takes us back to the pre-Spanish period. Remarkably, the notched flutes, panpipes, and ocarinas of today were present then also, and the instruments were involved in ceremony, ritual, healing, and spiritual transcendence. Probably. The records of Spanish priests, the plethora of anthromorphic and animalistic ceramics, and remaining ceramic, bone, and wood instruments provide clues that are supported by ancient architectural design, threads of folklore, and contemporary musical practices. Interpretations of use vary with each cultural anthropologist and archeologist, and Olsen has his own concepts, so well presented here. The importance of his book, however, is in the musicology, his thorough analysis of instrument design and manufacture, pitch, and scale. The investigation is a tour de force, taking him to museum collections around the world, doing field work in the Andes, and interviewing shaman-healers. The many photographs of musician ceramics and instruments are wonderful, demonstrating how important music was in the life of Andean Indians. Olsen covered the Peruvian Moche especially, but he also examined the Sinu and the Tairona of north Colombia with their unusual dual and triple chamber globular flutes. My only negative is that he did not include a CD of the sounds of the various instruments but instead provided an internet web address, which is no longer active. I found the new web page: [...] and it provides 52 examples. Hearing the pitches and intervals is prime evidence for his musical discoveries.

Shri Rag captures the mood between late afternoon sunset and the changing light of dusk. The heat of the day has reached its zenith and the evening approaches. The sultry raga unfolds slowly and with great depth. It is performed here live was performed live in London, England (date not given) by the great sitarist Nikhil Banerjee and his excellent tabla accompanist, Anindo Chatterjee. His interpretations and improvisational style are similar to that of Ali Akbar Khan because they have the same musical spirit and temperament, as instilled by their guru Allaudin Khan. Although out of print and the label is retired, this album and others of the same series are still available new (as of this date of review) from specialty sellers, such as Shrimati's in Berkeley, CA. If you like Hindustani classical music, its depth and emotional power, seek out these recordings. Such long performances, with fully developed alaps, permit the raga modes to nurture the respective emotions. Ragas should not be rushed. The album, of 61 minutes, has a gat of 10-beat jhaptal and 16-beat teental, which leaves us most satisfied. Banerjee died in 1986, having set the standard for sitar.

Many Turkish ensembles and musicians are available, playing modern, classical Ottoman, gypsy, other ethnic, and regional musics. For a flavor of traditional forms with a contemporary arrangements, this album by Burhan &Ouml;cal's Istanbul Oriental Ensemble is for me the best of his many similar recordings and among the finest of all Turkish albums available. Oud, violin, qanun zither, clarient and zurna reeds, various drums and other percussion, and tanbur and saz lutes perform both stately and sensual dances, passionate ballads, laments, and humorous tunes, closing with a Turkish-Greek jam, with Greek guest musicians (group Prosech&oacute;s). The amusing storyline of the insert notes creates a tone poem of the nine tracks. This album, recipient of the German Record Critics Award, should be among the collections of world music fans. It is good start for those especially interested in Turkish music.

Contemporary and traditional, electronic and acoustic, religious and artistic: this album of classical Iranian melodies, Sufi poetry, and recording wizardry is sung and arranged by Sussan Dyhim supported by musicians playing the Persian instruments of setar, zarb, daf, zarb, kamancheh, ney, tar plus cello, bass, Indian tabla, and violin. Overdubbing and self-harmonization of voice particularly produces an otherwordly, spiritual feeling without being New Age, though on the cusp. I like it! The music is deeper and more meditative than the similar modern group Niyaz. Sometimes the ensemble produces an airy gossamer, other times it is a strong rhythmic dance, like Sufi breathy repetitions and body movements. The album is moody and mesmerizing.

A few anthologies of rebetika from the 1920s and 1930s taken from old 78 rpm records are available, but a search for modern recordings will be difficult. This music is regarded as old-fashioned and alien. Ross Daly and the group Labyrinth are based in Crete, which itself has strong Greek and Turkish influences in its own unique music. Thus, these musicians accompanying singer Niki Tramba had no problem in performing the old Smyrna, Turkish, style. Tramba, who selected the pieces after long study of the mentioned archives, sings well, capturing the feeling of Rosa Eskenazi, Markia Papagika, and Rita Abatzi. These 'Greek blues' tell of life in taverns, hashish dens, prisons, of difficult romances, prostitution, crimes and passions. The instruments are also reflective of the Turkish origin of this form; we hear oud, kemene, ney, kanun, sanur, bendir and darabuka, as well as Western violin and clarinet. [In contrast, the modern rebetika group Pasatempo play a Greek dance style with bouzouki, tzouras, baglamas, guitar, bass, and accordion.] Over the 72 minutes and 16 tracks, we hear in excellent sound the music of the immigrant Greeks who fled the new nation of Turkey in the 1920s after the collapse of the Ottoman empire after World War I. They settled in Athens and the port of Piraeus. Their cosmopolitan music reflected influences of Persia, Armenia, Turkey, the Balkans, Romani and Jews, of taksim and ghazals. With this album, old rebetika lives.

The physical power of Alim Qasimov's voice simply cannot be conveyed by a recording, although his interpretative art and passion of the classical mugham (maqam) modes can be appreciated. (I heard him as part of Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project.) This 1997 live concert recording introduces on two tracks Alim Qasimov's daughter, then age 18, on vocal and daf drum. His supporting musicians on tar lute and kamancha spike fiddle vary over the years; on this recording they are Malik Mansurov and his brother Eisen Mansurov, respectively. The long second track presents mugham shour, in which Qasimov slowly developes the mood with poetic lyrics; his improvisations bring the listener deeper into the emotion. Classical mughams, like Hindustani ragas, have free and rhythmic sections, but are composed of suites of greater and lesser intensity but ends at a peak of feeling. As in many North Indian classical concerts, the final work is a light classical or folk tune. Enjoy the ride!

Those fans and students of South Asian music may be familiar with the Dagar Brothers who performed dhrupad, ancient style of formal, devotional ragas, and the Sabri Brothers, qawwali Sufi singers. Another famous pair of musical brothers are the Ali Brothers, Nazakat (1932-1983 and Salamat Ali Khan (1934-2001), whose khyal style is more free and improvsiational and songs are of two to eight lines. From Pakistan, they traced their musical heritage 10 generations to the court of Emperor Akbar the Great. Having learned the art from their father Vilayat Ali Khan of the Sham Chaurasi garana, and debuting while children, they came to Europe and the United States beginning in 1969 as part of the expanding world interest in Hindustani music. This particular recording was made in Cologne, Germany, on June 14, 1970, and features three ragas. Darbari Kanada (31 minutes) goes back to the 16th-century court (Darbari is the royal designate) and is associated with late night; its mood is of nobility, strength, and devotion, focusing on the world as illusion. It is performed in 14-beat [3-4-3-4] jhumra, then 16-beat [4-4-4-4] tintal, and ends in 12-beat [6-6] ektal. The second raga, Raga Rageshvari (30 minutes) is somewhat less intense and serious, and while performed in the evening, its brings out love, romance, and peace. Fourteen and 16-beats are the tals. The final raga (15 minutes) is in light, romantic style. Pahadi is essentially a folk tune. Light classical dhuns often close a concert. The Ali Brothers here give a superb performance, weaving their improvisations, and the recording itself is fine in every way. They may have past, but Salamat's legacy lives on with four musician sons and a musican daughter.

Ron Yuval's "Tree of Life," features essentially the same excellent ensemble and the same woman Arabic singer, Najwa Gibran, as their previous CD, but it has a different emphasis. While "Under the Olive Tree" was mainly Eastern Mediterranean and more uniform in tone and slow tempo, the new CD has a foot in Andalusia/Sefarad, with more varied and vigorous tempi. The first CD is more contemplative or meditative; the second CD is more nostalgic. One is spiritual, the other is historical-cultural. The musical arrangements are somewhat better in "Tree of Life" probably because of the songs themselves and because the troupe is more experienced with each other. I like them both and to say which is better depends on mood and setting, but for the variety of music and more cheerfulness, I would go with "Tree of Life." This ensemble of Jews, Muslims, and Christians, whose releases are from Israel, demonstrates hope in a troubled land; then, musicians have always crossed boundaries and prejudices. Music is true Tree of Life.

The editor of this excerpted and commented edition of Whitehead's Process and Reality observes that the philosophy is "extremely difficult" and its "opacity is monumental." This is an understatement. Indeed, the prose and concepts are so sophisticated that had I not already become well-versed in the parallel philosophy of Hua-Yen Buddhism, had a career in ecosystem research, and from extensive scientific knowledge apprehended categorical feedback loops and self-organization among all the orders of nature, this book would have required long hours of hard labor or would have been tossed as incomprehensible. Instead, I was easily able to follow the arguments and nod in agreement, for Whitehead coming from a Western philosophical tradition beginning with Spinoza and familiar with then new quantum concepts and prescient speculative physics was able to reach the same conclusions of Chinese philosophers centuries earlier. Process metaphysics and its holistic and gestaltic aspects has potential explanatory power in the brave new world of 11-dimensional string theory, informational field concepts, and even parapsychology. Mutual dependence and mutual arisings clarify William Blake's mysticism. Creativity is seen as the divine engine of the universe working at every level; Whitehead makes God a universal set of action, akin to the Logos of religious systems. If you desire to study Process and Reality in Whitehead's own words, then this book is useful, for Sherburne has tamed the beast and the glossary is most helpful. Nonetheless, unless you are already a learned philosophical scholar familiar with such presentations, I strongly recommend preliminary readings in related areas. Certainly, books on Hua-Yen apply more accessible metaphors and books on biological systems theory can present tangible relationships.

From Paraguay, Venezuela, Cuba, Brazil, and Colombia, this album of light classical guitar compositions arranged with mild, subdued percussion and, on three tracks, soprano saxophone provide us with the gentle side of Latin America. Pleasant folk melodies and swaying dances are performed by the new star of guitar, Sharon Isbin, recognized for her elegance, precision, and clarity plus refined interpretations. Paul Winter, who before becoming an acoustic New Age musical hero, was a performer of Latin jazz and here nicely complements the guitar. Thiago de Mello is the percussionist and also composer of some tracks. In the 1989, John Williams, the guitarist, recorded a very similar solo album, "Spirit of the Guitar: Music of the Americas," that also included compositions of Mangor&eacute;, Lauro, and Brouwer. Some direct comparisons are possible, and Isbin's sound, technique, and selections are superior. Hers is more enjoyable, more in spirit of these nations. For a relaxed brunch or afternoon unwinding, this album will set you in a happy mood.

Selected for Putumayo's Brazilian Caf&eacute; anthology album, this recording from Toco [Tomaz di Cunto] features his own compositions. An &eacute;migre to Italy, Toco cames from So Paulo where his TV work introduced him to the music of major innovators of Brazilian music, such as Gilberto Gill and Caetano Veloso. This, his second album, is filled with mellow sambas. Recorded in Rio de Janeiro, the musicians include Roberto Menescal on guitar and Rosalia De Souza on back-up vocals. A full studio band of piano, horns, flute and saxophone, and percussion round out the instrumental support. The tunes are contemporary in arrangements yet a continuation of the samba and bossa nova traditions. The lyrics are provided in Portuguese only, but it matters little as the music is excellent. Toco's voice lacks that special sound, but as musician and composer he knows how to make a very fine album. Rhythmic, diverse and rich in arrangements, and strong in jazz sensitivity, Outro Lugar will indeed make you want to hear it another time, and again once more.

This double-CD album of Nikhil Banerjee is from a somewhat early performance in his career at a time when Indian music was much in vogue among hippiedom and New Agers. Thus, in 1972 at De Kosmos, a converted church in the harbor of Amsterdam and venue for many counter-culture activities, Banerjee played a full concert of early evening pieces (with light show!): his own composition related to Marwa, Raga Manomanjari [75 minutes] with 7-beat rupak tal and concluding 16-beat tintal, and the more familiar Raga Sindhu Khamaj [70 minutes]. The first is presented seriously, conveying heroic devotion; the second being more romantic and lighter, with raga-mala of other modes and a concluding and stirring jawal-sawab call-and-response between sitar and tabla. Banerjee will reach greater artistic heights in the coming years, and at this time his improvisations were comparable to the best, again the best of his contemporary and elder Ravi Shankar. Thus, we hear some excellent music. The sound is very good, with a close microphone for an intimate setting. This album will provide much pleasure to those who enjoy music of North India and particulary that of the master sitarist, Nikhil Banerjee.

This live recording by Nikhil Banerjee was made in May 1970 when he was age 39, comparatively young for Indian musicians whose training under a guru master is long and exacting. Banerjee's gurus were Allaudin Khan and his son Ali Akbar Khan, and like his teachers, he regarded the alap as the core of the spiritual experience in listening to ragas. This album of 60 minutes includes an alap of 11 minutes followed by a rhythmic jor of another 12 minutes. Thus, before he begins the exciting gat sections (and it is truly so here, with final rapid jhalla and tabla-sitar exchanges, jawab sawal), we listeners are in a highly peaceful and meditative state. Rag Hemant, a composition by Alluadin Khan, is of the evening, and though it means autumn, it is more associated with the advent of winter, not spring as stated in the liner notes. The recording and performance are extraordinary and are as satisfying and powerful as Ali Akbar Khan's performance of the rag in the album Indian Architexture. The yet young Nikhil Banerjee was already astonishing and mature in his art. This is a great recording, one of Banerjee's best.

Ravi Shankar has many, many recordings, but only a small percentage have the profundity and musicianship as this recording of his own created raga, Raga Charukauns, a merger of the North Indian Malkuans and the Karnatic raga, Charukeshi. Recorded in a London studio in 1986, it opens in the low register of sitar. The slow, rhythmless alap is quickly passed through to enter a moderate tempo jor. The mood is passionately heroic and dignified appropriate to late evening. The gat, consisting of half the raga, is divided into a slow to moderate 16-beat teental and ending in a fast 12-beat ektal. As I have grown older, I now prefer long, meditative alaps, but Shankar is a showman and popularizer and the long gat here, with Alla Rakha's brilliant tabla work, is indeed a grand performance. Shankar's teacher, Allaudin Khan, would have been proud of his student's album.

Mali has produced many international stars with its bluesy melodies and sweet timbre of harp kora or guitar and xylophone baliphon accented typically by a chorus of women but often men. There are regional differences in music across this land, which spans forest and Saharan desert, but all feel comfortable and vaguely familiar to our ears. When Habib Koite and his group Bamada came to American attention via his Putumayo recording Ma Ya in 1999, we floated in his gentle songs and wondered if he would continue this feeling or fall prey to Euro-Pop. Some live recordings appeared as he flexed and developed his journeyman skills in tours around the planet. Now, with this studio recording we all can rejoice with a superb collection of songs. Musically well-arranged and complex, with styles from various regions of Mali and with touching lyrics, for they are given in translation with a synopsis, this CD is a delight. Repeated listening increases the appreciation. Note that this group provides a mellow and contemplative sound, with soft dance rhythms. Only 46 minutes are provided, however, and we long for more.

The musical success of an Early Music ensemble largely depends on varied arrangements of archived tunes and the assortment of traditional instruments. The European group Oni Wystars Ensemble features three vocalists (Belinda Sykes, Jeremy Avis, and Peter Rabanser) and makes use diverse European and Middle Eastern instruments in this album. These include oud, bagpipe, duduk, fiddle, rebec, Jew's harp, recorder, reed-flute, harp, hurdy gurdy, bendir, darabuka, zarb, riqq, and davul. The musicians here have selected Medieval songs across the Mediterrean from Turkey and the Byzantine Empire to Moorish Andalusia, Spain. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are represented. Such varied favors and rhythms maintain interest, although the tone is fairly uniform. Moreover, I found the Arabic unconvincing but the Hebrew acceptable. Aside from this, the album is very pleasant listening. It imparts a fantasy of being a 13th- or 14th-century trader visiting many ports and hearing regional musicians. As we would be enriched by such a journey, this album, a live recording, provides us a wealth of sounds.

Jerusalem means City of Peace. The reality is that the city and Judea/Israel/Palestine rarely have known peace, the result of being at the crossroads of three continents and a host of empire-builders and being the centers of three conflicting religions. The chorus echoes over and over, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it!" And the soprano at one point sings, "Blessed shall he be who shall seize and clash thine infants against the rock." What? Against history and these lyrics Tavener's Lament is a deep meditation. Its harmonies and repetitions, the soaring angelic voice of Angharad Gruffydd Jones and the elevated yet earthly voice of countertenor Peter Crawford bring forth a spirituality where Jerusalem becomes not a place but a state of mind. The work slowly and subtly builds in intensity, and closes quietly in the last minute with a trio in the chorus as if a fading echo. Most of Tavener's compositions do not work for me, but the few that do are powerful and effective. His religious music does not follow the Western example of majesty and awe but rather an Eastern approach of delicacy, spaciousness, mantric repetition, and paradox. This album, at a budget price, is a fine example of Tavener's musical style.

The most important aspect of this compilation is its being issued by the Smithsonian, meaning that it is scholarly and historically rooted rather than a selection from some label's archive. Indeed, it was produced to accompany an exhibit and a book. The Columbia Essential Latin Jazz, isn't. Not even close. The Putumayo anthology at least has the major pioneer Latino band leaders. With the Smithsonian compilation, however, we hear the key historic recordings, many of the same presented in the recent PBS series on Latin Jazz: Machito's Tanga, Dizzy Gillspie's Manteca, Stan Kenton's The Peanut Vendor, Tito Puente's Mambo Beat, Mongo Santamaria's Afro-Blue, Cal Tjader's Soul Sauce, and more recent artists, such as David Sanchez, Paquito D'Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, and Chucho Vald&eacute;s' Con Poco Coco. The extensive liner notes are bilingual. The album is 69 minutes in duration. The 15 selections are outstanding. It begins with Tanga and the excitement of that stunning composition continues through the series of tracks. For a historical survey, this album is the truly essential anthology for jazz and Latin jazz collectors.

The music on this album should be regarded as light classical. It consists of a modern suite of filigree improvisations on melodic phrases, called goushehs, and within given modes, called dastgah. There is nothing heavy or contemplative here, which is a nice change of pace from some of this well-recorded group's more serious endeavors. The barbat, a five double-stringed, pear-shaped lute provides a bass mandolin-like sound. The setar, the small long-necked lute with moveable frets is the treble. The rhythm is emphasized by a goblet-shaped drum, the tombak. The Western-based Dastan Trio consists of Hossein Behroozii-Nia, Hamid Motebassem, and Pejman Hadadi, and this 48-minute long, 2001 studio recording came during their Los Angeles tour. Now, that I have established the facts, I will note that I enjoyed this performance of cheerful music and liked the rhythmic drumming that propelled the group to the forceful conclusion. When you are in a lighter mood and want to hear something from Iran, this recording will do nicely.

Russian gypsy music: can this Talisman Trio of Oleg Niehs (accordian), Olesksandr Klimas (violin), and Vadim Kulitskii (guitar) avoid romantic stereotypes and Hollywood clich&eacute;s? The answer, happily, is yes! They have the musicianship, modern witty arrangements, and the joy of performance. This is a live recording. Trained classically and in folk traditions (including gypsy), coming from the Ukraine, Siberia, and Russia, these artists have wide experience. For instance, Kulitskii worked with Yehudi Menuhin, Ravi Shankar, L. Subramaniam, and Gideon Kremer, and Klimas learned jazz and Latin American music. Ignore the album's title; the music is actually gypsy style, rather than of traditional gypsy tunes, with sometimes a Django jazzy feel and other times a nostalgic lament washed down with vodka. Their music is so wide in scope that they can sound like a Fellini soundtrack. They can play a sensuous tango, a romantic ballad, or, yes, a fast gypsy dance. They also sing on some tracks. Musically clever and technically astute, the Talisman Trio is fun listening. [The bonus track on the 2010 reissue, which is re-titled "Russian Gypsy Soul", is a gypsy tune from a different CD of the group Zingaros from Argentina. It meshes well.]

Like many American jazz artists, classical composers seem to get their hearing by going to Europe. Fortunately, Naxos provides fine recordings of their compositions with award-winning performers and at budget prices. This album of a grand selection of Carter Pann's compositions at the outset of his career is such an example. With Jos&eacute; Serebriet at the podium of the Czech State Philharmonic and Barry Snyder at the piano, the wit and charm of Pann's works are manifest. Youthful play is matched by craft. The sweet melodies and complex structures of Deux s&eacute;jours surprise us after the classic last movement of the Piano Concerto. As soon as we are lulled by the romance of a pastoral and gymnop&eacute;die, we are treated in his Dance Partita to some strange and wild corners of the baroque, with an odd nostalgic Celtic-like folk dance and a Broadway jazzy Mozartian kaleidoscope thrown in...musical guffaws. The final tracks are tourist impressions of Barcelona. Gaudi's own peculiar organic architecture is keenly suggested by the jaggedness and dark orchestral drones amid the cathedral bells. The Bullfight, whose traditional tunes develop into an airy ballroom dance, is sympathetic to the bull. Thus. this album is rich in musical moods and is a showcase of Pann's wide-ranging art. Ol&eacute;!

This book is divided into 3 sections. Nearly half the book deals with the technical basics of what defines and characterizes music, a tedious block of chapters that could have been reduced to an enlarged glossary. The second section is the more interesting, since neuroscience and cognition is at last treated, and here Levitin discusses some new experimental information on the mysterious processes that make music a unique and emotionally powerful form of language and communication. However, it is too short and rather sketchy, and we are left thirsty for more and more detailed information. The final quarter of the book is taken up in a hodge-podge of topics, from the predilections toward certain musical tastes, to the qualities of musicianship, to evolutionary origins of music, all of which could be a book in themselves. Indeed, the several books of Joachim-Ernst Berendt are far more worthy in dealing with these various subjects. Thus, only about 1/4 of the book actually approaches the specific subject of the title, with only a couple of pages mentioning how music triggers the pleasure pathways and regions involved in addiction and obsession, aspects that bring a philosophic attribute into biochemistry. Scattered throughout the book are references to popular Western music, jazz, and classic compositions, in order to provide some reference points for the readership. World music, which has a wider spectrum of timbre, so important in his discussion, is barely scratched. In short, I was disappointed with the book as being insufficiently focused.

Among my dozens of Moroccan recordings and various other CDs of Middle Eastern and Inner Asian Sufi music, this one is special. While keeping the flavor of North African Andalusia with instrumentation and vocal style, the slower tempo and quiet passion reaches into the depths of the poetry, much like Turkish and Persian traditions. The ubiquitous Chemirani on percussion adds a further, timeless and more worldly dimension to the performance. The sound quality is excellent. There is wide variety in the selection of pieces, from ensemble to solos, set works and improvisations. You will not be disappointed.

The "O" being at Paris' L'Olympia famous concert venue. Ahmad Jamal's recordings are often hit-and-miss with me, but this album is a home run. His milestone recording that put him on the musical map was At The Pershing and this 70th birthday bash of November 2000 is another brilliant example of the charm of live recordings. Jamal's customary trio of Idris Muhammad on drums and James Cammack on bass is supplemented here with George Colman on tenor saxophone. Jamal arranges his own music, and the addition of the saxophone allows Jamal to step back at times as support. This ad hoc quartet produces richness in improvisation and musical interactions, and I hope that Jamal would further explore the quartet approach on his tours. Nicely recorded with sound depth and clarity, the perfomance is exciting. The first track, Night Has A Thousand Eyes, launches the evening brilliantly. Jamal's chord strikes and bass runs propel Autumn Leaves. Colman and Jamal's exchanges on My Foolish Heart are a joy. The final track, Aftermath, is Jamal's own composition, which allows the trio (Colman sits out) to stretch and explore. Jamal fans should own this recording, one of his best.

This album of traditional, popular, and ritual Vietnamese from northern, central, and southern regions give the listener some appreciation of the variety of musical instruments and styles. The vocalists of the ensemble, A&iacute; Xun, Diu Dc, B&iacute;ch Phuong, and B&iacute;ch Li demonstrate the unique Vietnamese glissando and warble form, akin to that of the dan bau single-string instrument. The sound is melancholic, even if the lyrics or melody is uplifting. Besides the dan bau, the ensemble includes the dan tranh zither, the dan co 2-string fiddle, flutes, and percussive cymbals and sticks. The final track is one of most popular folk melodies from the south about a man traveling to meet his bride and returning on a black horse. Vietnam is a strong buffer state, and its music bears little similarity to its neighbors Thailand and China. Along with the Parsons' excellent 3-disc survey, this album is a good introduction to Vietnamese music.

Reissued in 2010 with two indirectly related bonus tracks, this album by Shafqat Ali Khan is evidence that the Sham Chaurasi tradition of classical singing, going back 11 generations, is in good hands. Indeed, I find his voice more enjoyable than that of his father, the late Salamat Ali Khan. Indeed, at age 12 he was given the title of ustad, master. Accompanied by tabla, harmonium, sarangi, and tanpura drone, the various Sufi songs and ragas (Bharvi, Piloo, Yaman Kalyan, Bhutyar) are powerfully performed. The recording is engineered bright with a sense of being in large open chamber. Listening intently to Khan's artistry in the thumri, the semi-classical form, and the serious pure raga style, I was struck by his control and crisp ornamentation. These are strong, emotional pieces yet meditative in effect. Afterwards, I seem to move as if in a dance. This is an excellent recording that may surprise even those unfamiliar with classical Indian vocal forms.The first bonus track is a poem by Hafiz sung by Zohreh Jooya and an Irani ensemble; the second bonus, while also related to Sufism, is by the G&uuml;lizar Turkish Music Ensemble. With these additions, the album is 79 minutes in duration.

This reissued and world distribution of the first album of Adnan, Wissam, and Samir Joubran's oud explorations as a trio fall into the realm between formal taqsim and jazz improvisation. As the family of the Romeros had issued group classical Spanish guitar recordings, these Palestinian brothers from Nazareth are developing a new musical sound. Oud duets are not new, but a trio offers greater ability for arrangements and harmony. Such tracks as Shagaf and Safar demonstrate such symphony-like capacity. Is this jazz? Is this Arabic music? Is this classical chamber music? The Joubran Trio has a feeling for all, and they bring us to emotional and intellectual heights. There is much profundity in their performance, helped by their understanding of pregnant pauses and the power of the space between notes. The last track is a live recording from a concert in Ramallah, in which Samir Joubran sing a popular tune of Mohamed Abdel Wahab, with lyrics by Hussein El Sayed. Listen and enjoy this highly satisfying and innovative album.

[I obtained this recording at my local record store in October 2009. Since it had arrived within the previous three months, it may actually be available again.] Nikhil Banerjee was the greatest sitarist of recent decades. Ravi Shankar is certainly more popular and a showman, but Banerjee, like Ali Akbar Khan, was more involved in the profoundity of the raga. His alap explorations were long and artistic, his virtuosity in performance produced powerful improvisations and meditations. In this particular recording, the first of the live concert series, Banerjee is joined by tabla wizard Zakir Hussain in a 68-minute Rag Shyam Kedar, a blend of the early evening ragas Shyam Kalyan and Kedara. The concert occurred somewhere in Canada (Vancouver? Toronto?) sometime in the early 1980s (Banjerjee died in 1986). The final movement, the gat, is in ada chautal (13 minutes; 14-beat) and teental (23 minutes; 16-beat). There is much joy in this raga, as reflected in the passion of this gat and in the spirited exchange between Hussain and Banerjee. In short: superb! [Note that Volume 3 in this series is not yet listed on Amazon; it is a performance of rags Marwa and Prabi Kalyan at the Ali Akbar College of Music in 1985 with Swapan Chaudhuri on tabla. That recording will leave you in awe.]

Sandwiched between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan on the west, Kazakstan to the north, and China at the southeast, small Kyrgystan has been called the Switzerland of Central Asia. Even the warm ornate traditional costumes of its peoples suggest those of its European alpine sister nation. Of all the Central Asian musics, I find that of Kyrgyzstan to be the loveliest, the gentlest, the most lyrical. The komuz, a lute, with its synthethic strings is soft in tone, and the songs by women vocalists are sweet. This album presents traditional yet twentieth-century compositions and examples of the wide variety of instruments (choor and sybzgy flutes; chopo choor ocarina; wooden and metal jew's harps; kyl kiyak upright fiddle; and the komuz] and musical styles. Having heard the group Tengir-Too in person, I can attest to the excellent performance and quality of these recordings. Their acrobatic playing of the komuz, like Western rock guitarists, is probably unique on the Silk Road.The separate 24-minute interactive DVD provides a good background to the teaching and preservation of this music and the creation of its instruments. The booklet has lyrics and fine photographs. The Smithsonian and the Aga Khan Trust have done a superb job in developing this series of recordings and videos. If you think that you know Central Asian music, with its Persian, Turkic, and Mongolian influences, listen to this album and be surprised and delighted.

The rise and decline of the popular conceptions of hippiedom are well depicted in the documentary; indeed, it the best that I have seen of similar works produced locally in the Bay Area and nationally, typically with focus on 1968, the year after the so-called Summer of Love. I am an academic hippie myself, age 62 at the time of this review, and was present at the Gathering of Tribes, the formal start of the period, and have lived through all the depicted events before and after. Most other documentaries failed to emphasize the key spiritual component of the cultural revolution. Yes, it was sex, drugs, and rock & roll, but it was also spirituality and consciousness studies that eventually led to environmental/ecology movements, cognitive neuroscience, and psychoimmunology, as well as the increasing popularity of Buddhism in the United States and the development of world music appreciation. As described, all the hippie wannabes spoiled the scene, did not understand the ideologies nor the proper use of entheogens. The popular image of hippies was of them, not the more thoughtful, experimental, and realized post-Beats, the pioneers who led the way. [Peter Coyote's use of B***S*** was bleeped from the PBS broadcast, but we do not need such censorship on the DVD.] Unfortunately, the documentary is too short, merely an hour, making the price of the DVD a tad too much. Still, if you want a proper introduction to the rise of this American Experience, yet influencing the nation as much as the Vietnam War, then this DVD is for you.

This is progressive jazz in the same manner of the musical giants of the late 1950s and early 1960s who sought complexity and innovation within a limited improvisation. Ray Drummond's bass is joined with Chris Potter's tenor and Gary Bartz's alto and soprano saxophones, Renee Rosnes' piano, and Billy Hart's drums (plus Joe Lovano's and John Richmond's tenor saxophones on one track), as the master musicans mutually develop each piece. Drummond tells us that he follows the Miles Davis Theory of Bandleading: providing a concept and trusting the talents of band members to gestaltically construct the whole. And they do succeed in a series of intricate studies. "Dedication (To John Hicks)" is the best track of the album, but all are worthy listening. There are impressions and poetry and some familiar modern standards, as Elenor Rigby and Poor Butterfly. In short, a fine album.

The nation of Georgia is sandwiched between the Black and Caspian Seas. Its rich music came to Western attention with the Nonesuch Explorer release in 1989 of the Rustavi Choir, which set the standard. This particular recording by Ensemble Kereoni focuses on brief folk songs and includes instruments of lutes, double-head drum, and duct flute. The harmony and polyphony of the five men, singing 24 work, dance, love, and "table" tunes, is well-engineered and well-performed. This is beautiful and sweet music, even healing. Some arrangments are contemporary or popular, such as track 8, Flower Country; others seem ancient. Whether joyously romantic or seriously religious, whether a soft lullaby or a bright working or drinking song, the music is always interesting and leaves the listener comfortable and happy.

When I obtained this album in 1991 on the original Decca ARGO label, I was amazed by the sheer happiness. Here were the pulses and stacattos I associated with minimalism, but the brief tunes grabbed me and took me for rides. These colorful pieces from the late 1980s were readily appropriated by ballet companies for their rhythmic interest and energetic movement. They have been compared to early Stravinsky in jaggedness and orchestration. Torke has made a career with such optimistic, episodic works, and he derived the name of his own record company from the third track here, Ecstatic Orange. Torke's works have become popular because of their harmony, brassy energy, joy, percussive propulsion, and brevity. The final track is Bright Blue Music. Blue is associated with the melancholia and intellect, but here the music dances in emotional freedom and fun.

With some of the same tone and feeling as Nik B&auml;rtsch's Ronin modal improvisations, this album of the postmodern avant-garde trio The Bad Plus demonstrates why they were selected for the recent album of Disney covers, Everybody Wants to Be a Cat. Their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist Anderson, two by drummer King, and one by pianist Iverson) are energetic and often noisy. Each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. The scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. The lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, Giant, arises as a fresh breeze. The well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. The problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. The musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick.

What can I add that reviewer Melvyn Sobel has not provided or indicated by his enthusiasm? As Bach's Goldberg Variations were realized as more than the initially conceived keyboard exercise, Auerbach's circle of fifths is far more than a compositional conceit. It is an adventure, a dark odyssey through dense Russian woods, across torrents, into deep caves, rising into ancient ruins and frenzied modern urban streets. Her poetic sensitivity and cultural depth shines. She runs into the spirit of Shostokovich, not with his guarded cynicism and satire, but with his more private chamber abstractions. Auerbach presents us remarkable inventions; each Prelude is utterly unique. Out of some gloom comes a bright but twisted folk dance, and soon we are again in melancholy or chased by some malevolent apparition. The saga closes with a lament and then an explosion, with piano bass pounding and a Paganini flurry of violin notes, leading to a final sigh. After this sad sojourn we hear a prayer of solo violin in memory of the Holocaust and then a brief memorial to a friend. Nothing jovial on this album!What is more amazing is that this wunderkind, who composed an opera at age 12 that was actually staged and toured, is an award-winning poet. (Her photographic portrait in the package insert is a shock: so young!) Talk about an "old soul"! Our appreciation of her work would not occur without a proper performance and recording, and here Israeli musicians Vadim Gluzman on violin and Angela Yoffe, piano, mesh with the music. There is a shared heritage, after all. The Swedish label, BIS, does a first rate production, too.

Sufism (which here are forms of Islamic mysticism, as brotherhoods, centered around a given guru teacher or saint) is strong in the Maghreb, Andalusian North Africa. Many recordings are available for Sufi brotherhoods in Morocco, but Tunisian Sufism is rarely encountered. From France's Institut du Monde Arabe came another in their fine series of albums. The Sulmiyya ensemble, founded in 1958 and consisting of 10 members (at least for this recording), performs their own and other pieces associated with different brotherhoods, such as the Tayyibiyya, the Qdiriyya, and the Isawiyya (Aissawa). Rhythm is enhanced by bendir frame drum, naghart kettle drums, and tar tambourine. They sing suites of hymns in call-and-response form. The album lasts 63 minutes. While a fine recording, it somehow does not seem to measure up to others I have of Sufi brotherhoods in this region, mainly of Morocco. A lack of energy or spunk, perhaps. Still, as mentioned, this is an unusual album and worth your attention if you are interested in world music, Arabic music, or Sufism. [By the way, if you happen to be in Berkeley, CA, around the time of this review, you may find several inexpensive copies of the album at Amoeba Records.]

This 2 CD set, whose track listing thus far on the web page refers to disk 2, is composed of good but not great songs from an important and very fine vocalist. For a showcase of her talents, one of the "Best Of" compilations would be a better introduction. The tracks are from previous albums on several labels (Eros, Sony, and Lyra), with the earliest from 1987 and the most recent being 2004. This means 30 representative samples from her recording history. All documentation is in Greek, but there are no notes beyond track listing and sources. Nonethess, the set is worthy to any collection and will bring much enjoyment. And, hey, 4 stars still is a good rating.

Ballak&eacute; Sissoko, a kora player of Mali, has a knack for teaming up with other musicians for excellent duo recordings. In 1999 he joined Toumani Diabate for New Ancient Strings and in 2009 he and cellist Vincent Segal made Chamber Music. Between those dates, in 2003, he and Ludovico Einaudi, the Italian pianist who has made many, many gentle Windham Hill-like albums, first came together in Mali to test the waters and make some beautiful, peaceful music to float downstream and then recorded this album in Italy at the Teatro Petrella. (Photographs shows Einaudi with an electronic keyboard in Mali, but here he plays acoustic.) The very softly played, largely improvised melodies are based on Malian musical phrases, European and Caribbean elements, and a touch of American blues. The musicians weave their notes, but as the kora is shallow in intensity compared to the piano, it is Einaudi who dominates and Sissoko who adds timbre flavor to the pieces. The ten tracks comprise 68 minutes. No works stands out and the individual pieces are forgettable, but the consistent tone offers tranquility and peace of mind.

Until that great documentary of 1993, Latcho Drom, most of us, when the term "gypsy" was uttered, would think of some restaurant violinst playing Central European rhapsodies, a Spanish flamenco guitarist, or Django Rhinehardt of jazz fame. An echo of that film came with the recent world touring groups of Gypsy Caravan. A highlight for me was my introduction to Fanfare Ciocarlia, a Romanian brass band that performs sibra, hora, ruseaca, manea dances and other tunes, fingering their instruments at lightning speed. As complex as traditional New Orlean jazz band but at warp speed, this group makes you want to dance once you get passed being frozen with awe of their brilliance. This early one-hour recording (1999) keeps to their roots with tune selection. Once common, such brass bands are now rare among the villages, but Fanare Ciocarlia keeps the tradition alive. Play this album with friends and see their surprise.

Aside from the first piece, an orchestral adaptation of Harrison's Suite for Violin and American Gamelan, this album provides some of his shorter chamber works. We hear cello with piano, cello with harp, and solo piano compositions scored between 1949 and 1995. Harrison's music is based on dance and melody, and other than his very early 12-tone classical-rooted works, he looked to Indonesia for modes and rhythms. The edited violin suite has a different feeling compared to the original gamelan-based arrangement; it lacks three short movements [see: La Koro Sutra album], but it works very well and has grand lyrical eloquence. The bright Estampie dance and extraordinarily beautiful Chaconne movements are exemplars of Harrison's style. The chamber pieces are charming, all different from each other, all tuneful. This album is a gem among those available of Harrison's music.

I will make this short. If you are more interested in the theatrical aspects of musical theatre and seek that verve and spunk, those dramatic and exaggerated characterizations, then you will probably prefer the original 1953 and TV 1958 recordings with Rosalind Russell. If, on the other hand, you are more keen to hear contemporary sound quality with focus on Bernstein's music, then this 1999 album with Sir Simon Rattle, conductor, would be the better choice. Moreover, Kim Criswell, Audra McDonald, and the great Thomas Hampson are first rate vocalists and seem to be having fun. Bernstein wrote this music after that other Town show, On The Town, and this recording not only does justice to it but can serve to refresh the public's mind on how splendid was his Broadway writing before that blockbuster, West Side Story. The enclosed booklet with historical commentaries, photographs, and lyrics is also very worthwhile.

Question: Is this album a recording of (1) classical musicians playing bluegrass; or (2) bluegrass musicians playing classical music; or (3) musicians playing bluegrass-inspired classical music; or (4) musicians playing classical-inspired bluegrass music? Answer: Yes.Other than an occasional improvisation, or cadenza, this music is largely a bluegrass-type quartet (mandolin, guitar, violin, bass) playing scored music. At times the musicians play with the spirit of a downhome porch ensemble; other times they perform as if in a salon rather than a saloon. The musicianship is first-rate, as you would expect, and the sound of Joshua Bell's violin is liquid ambrosia. The album is very pleasant listening and the musicians surely had a grand time collaborating.But I am not entirely satisfied either as a bluegrass fan or as classical chamber music devotee. There is no consistency. This is a Sony Classical label and I shall place the CD on the shelf with my Aaron Copland, for five tracks are certainly classical in treatment (the Concert Duo) and are organized as movements. As Indonesian music inspired classical composers Lou Harrison and Colin McPhee, Appalachian bluegrass is the inspiration of Edgar Meyer's labors here. Indeed, there should be more Americana in American classical music. Perhaps this particular musical exploration will lead to fuller developments along that path.

The movie depicts the passion of jazz from both the perspective of a particular French fan and of musicians, particularly Dexter Gordon, who at the time found a musical home in France. The lineup of musicians playing in the film and this soundtrack are true giants: Chet Baker, Ron Carter, Dexter Gordon, Herbie Hancock, Billy Higgins, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby McFerrin, John McLaughlin, Wayne Shorter, Cedar Walton, Tony Williams, and Lonette McKee, vocalist. That roster alone should make your eyebrows rise in anticipation. Moreover, the selections include classics...Round Midnight, Body and Soul, The Peacocks, Rhythm-a-ning...and the very haunting tune by Hancock, Chan's Song (Never Said), which is emphasized by McFerrin's vocalise. This is lovely listening and excellent dinner jazz. Rent the film and buy this recording. Create memories.

Soundtracks to movies these days are often heard in sections and scenes and may be compilations of various composers and artists. Less frequently is it continual. Yuval Ron composed the music to match all the finished visuals of the 60-minute documentary Proteus, a film on the life, discoveries, and philosophy of 19th-century biologist Ernst Haeckel. The soundtrack has some elements of the Baroque and Romanticism to emphasize the historic backgound, but by and large the music is quasi ambient and a little Brahmsian. The only fast and lively sections are descending arpeggios that underlie a rapid series of stunning images of the crystalline skeletons of radioluria, certain protozoans. Without the visuals, the soundtrack of mysterious atmospherics and sound vignettes, although each isolated has some sonic interest, together amount to little. The film is composed of visuals, sound effects, and music, and this house divided will not stand. The elements act synergistically. The music works well with the film.

Violinists of the North Indian tradition are not common; they are typically seen in the Karnatic, or South Indian tradition. Perhaps it is because the North has the sarangi, with a cello-like timbre, as bowed instrument. Listening to Kala Ramnath on her self-titled album, I was immediately struck how vocal was her performance. I should not have been surprised, since Hindustani music originates with singing and ragas are associated with passages from religious literature, but her style seemed so much like that of Pandit Jasraj, one of her teachers. This is a good thing. As Jasraj is the much beloved vocalist whose performances reach spiritual profundity, Ramnath's violin sings and cries of humanity. You can compare her performance of the morning Raga Bhatiyar with that of Jasraj's [Worship by Music, Chhana Dhara] or any of his other recordings to recognize the influence. However, she has her own fine musical voice that we can appreciate. She plays with strength and a deep musical sense of development within the rag scale. This is an excellent album. I am pleased to hear another North Indian violinist besides V. G. Jog, and that a woman musician has made her mark is bonus. Brava!

Duets, or jugalbandis, are special treats in Hindustani music. We delight in contasts of sitar and sarod, sitar and reeded shehnai, sarod and bowed sarangi, and bansuri flute and santoor. We listen how two masters interact, echo, exchange, and co-develop the raga. This particular recording brings together two young masters: Purbayan Chatterjee on sitar and Kala Ramnath on violin. Shuhankar Banerjee supports them on tabla. They perform the evening scale, Raga Kedar, with its serious but romantic mood. To put it bluntly, these guys are good! The beautiful, soaring violin and the more grounded sitar take us on a meditative journey of peace, love, and joy. In the second, brief piece, Raga Bageshri, the musicians take turns to explore and cheerfully push the rag forward to its spirited conclusion. Chatterjee studied under the great sitarist Nikhil Banerjee; Ramnath developed under the teaching of vocalist Jasraj. These students learned the intepretative art well, and we have this remarkable happy recording to enjoy. The sound engineering, too, is very fine, with just enough echo for spatial depth.

Regarded as a raga of dusk, Rageshri was performed live in London (date not given) by the great sitarist, Nikhil Banerjee. His interpretations and improvisational style are similar to that of Ali Akbar Khan because they have the same musical spirit and temperament, as instilled by their guru Allaudin Khan. We hear 74 minutes of tranquility and romance appropriate to the coming evening. Although out of print and the label is retired, this album and others of the same series are still available new (as of this date of review) from specialty sellers, such as Shrimati's in Berkeley, CA. If you like Hindustani classical music, its depth and emotional power, seek out these recordings. Such long performances, with fully developed alaps, permit the raga modes to nurture the respective emotions. Ragas should not be rushed. Banerjee died in 1986, having set the standard for sitar.

Trade to and from Egypt to southern Africa, to India, and Persia included routes along the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. At the apex of the elbow turn is Yemen. Its history is ancient and its cultural exchanges are many. These field recordings from 1974 focuse on the Tihama people, who dwell along the Red Sea from Yemen to Mecca in Saudi Arabia and have much in common with people of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The climate is exceedingly hot. Its people follow shafa'i Islam and the veneration of saints. Their music includes work songs and pieces for religious rites and festivals. While reeded, twin-bore mizmar clarinets are present, along with shabbaba and qasaba end-blown flutes, it is the drum that dominates. Or drums. There are the madiff free-standing drum, the marfa and miskhal kettledrums, the two-headed tabla, and the wrist-held sahfa. For strings, the Tihama have the tumbara lyre. The tracks present songs for a wedding, dances, blacksmithing, and saint worship. There is even a popular Indian film song, in Hindi (a language not understood by the singer). The various drum rhythms are mezmerizing. The drummers, in contrast with other musicians, are of a wandering outcast group (an old and ubiquitous story), who have become masters of the art and whose performance was appreciated for healing powers. This album is fascinating. The different drumming is mainly of the Arabian tradition, but the final track of the marisi dance suggests Black African origin. These recordings are part of the Sound Archive of the British Library, a parallel to our Smithsonian and Library of Congress. Warning: listening to some tracks may very likely take you into a trance. Or make you stand up and dance. This album is not for those who seeks melody. 60 minutes.

The cultural revolution that shook Paris 1905 to 1930 is well chronicled in this mesmerizing two-hour DVD documentary, which includes photographs, film archives, literary excerpts, and analyses. The focus in on the arts, from classical music and jazz to sculpture, from poetry to dance, from painted canvases to novels. The rise of Modernism from the post-Impressionists to Fauvism, to Cubism, to Dada and to Surrealism and their numerous beaux-arts and literary pioneers is seen as an extraordinary period of free experimentation and cross-disciplinary interactions, particularly between poets and artists. Paris was the fermenting pot and the avant-garde was strong, sharp, and manifold. Watching this documentary can induce envy. O to have lived in such a time! Of course, I and many of my generation did indeed experience such a revolution, albeit of shorter duration in this accelerating society, when the San Francisco Bay Area circa 1965 to 1980 was the hub in musical, artistic, noetic, ecological and other scientific innovations and explorations. Which brings up a minor deficiency in the documentary: the absence of any mention of the developments in science, especially physics, and its influence on the arts, when concepts of time and space and matter were the subjects of radically new thinking. Otherwise, the survey is a wonderful cultural history, from the optimism of pre-WWI and the engine of cynicism and creative criticism following that carnage. The viewer can next plunge into the many books covering this exciting period for further study. This DVD is an excellent introduction in art history and cultural studies.

This bargain 2-CD compilation from recordings of 1977, 1983, 1986, and 1988 presents a sweep of music, from the classical Mozart to contemporary Lutoslawski, from the impressionistic Debussy and Ravel to modernism's Bartok, from the whimsy of Saint-Saens to the romance of Rachminoff. Throughout, the perfomances of Marth Argerich with fellow pianists, Stephen Kovacevich and Nelson Freire, with other notable other musicians, including Gidon Kremer and Mischa Maisky, are first rate. Most worthy listening are renditions of Bartok's Sonata for 2 pianos and Percussion and the later transcription and expansion to a Concerto with Orchestra. Ravel's La valse for two pianos is a powerful transciption. At the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, parlors would host the playing of duo piano transcriptions; these recordings remind us of the richness and strenth of sound two combined pianos can produce. Thus, this brilliant album is special and an excellent choice to add to one's collection or present as a gift.

This recording is something different. . . and wonderful. I am late in hearing the compositions and dazzling oud of Marcel Khalife. [Kudos to Amazon for leading me to him.] Largely in the 1980s and early 1990s, the then novel jazzlike, world music explorations of fellow Lebanese oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil reached American ears via ECM and Enja recordings (which I had collected), but Khalife's works are in another, more universal class. While certainly rooted in Arabic tarab art-music, they are close in spirit and form to classical Western chamber compositions or even modern free jazz (like the group Oregon or Keith Jarrett's solo piano improvisations). This recording is not fusion nor Europop-influenced music; rather it is truly modern Arabic music. Khalife's music, however, is unique and original; it defies precise categorization. Much appreciated in North Africa and the Middle East, Kahlife's audience will sure expand, and this booklike album will help. I especially recommend his earlier 2-CD 2-oud quartet release, "Jadal", which will astonish you and which I rate *****.

For what it is, soundtrack music to a pastiche of short scenes, the compositions do meet the bill: Berlin in the 20s with melodies and chamber arrangements of what we are conditioned to expect by, say, Kurt Weill. The segments of Industrial March and Nightlife are particularly evocative. I saw the Nightlife clip of the film on TV, which enticed me to purchase the CD. But it all left a sense of prelude. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this music is when incorporated with the film, on DVD. The Largo from the film The Last Laugh is pleasant, especially with the featured cello, but then I am a sucker for cello.

Jay Begaye, a highly regarded singer from the Dine people (Navajo lands) has often been nominated for music awards and he is again nominated for the 2007 Native American Music Awards. His music is fundamentally traditional in format, with his own lyrics, but he, simply put, has soul. Other more-or-less traditional recordings of Southwest Native peoples have plenty of gusto or reach toward New Age mellowness. Beyaye takes the middle path. With the occasional assistance of flute player Anthony Wakeman for color and tone or Darren Yazzie, for a guitar resonance, his songs convey profound spirit, respect for the land, and both the sorrow and joy of the human condition. He is an artist of sound and sight, being a painter and sculptor as well. The CD sound and engineering are excellent. Begaye's voice is clear, pleasant, and expressive. This recording would be a superb addition to your collection.

First recorded in 1988, Roundabout for contrabass and computer-generated tape is joined with a series of experimental and theatrical works, notably adaptations of ten brief haiku of the Japanese poet Buson. Carl's compositions develop around a sensitivity of plastic time and open space, but being a student of Xenakis, Rochberg, Crumb, and Wernick, his musical palette is modern, agitated, and somewhat noisy. Other than the quiet phrases of the haiku, these more extensive work reflects what Carl recognizes as the fragmented, whirling energy and virtualness of contemporary life. Don't expect some nice romantic melody to linger. Dabs, silences, and layering of half-tunes and some discords provoke, as some partially remembered dream. There are some flowing ambient aspects of Ives and Cage too. This is interesting music, but I personally would not want to hear it often.

Even though this scholarly but highly readable book concerns Arabic art music, the principles discussed can be applied to Western classical chamber music, opera, jazz, and even the Grateful Dead and their ardent fans, the Dead Heads. After all, Racy, as both ethnomusicologist and respected musician, observes the variation of musical inclinations and the different sophistication of listeners; the performance of music in different venues of home, concert hall, night club, and recording studio; and within social events as weddings and religious celebrations. The development, training, and social status of Arabic musicians seems to be universal. Even the objectives of art versus popular music are similar when comparing the heightened emotional state, indeed ecstasy, of Arabic tarab and the aesthetic appreciation of European lieder, operatic arias, and quartets. There is also a communal mutual appreciation that can act synergistically, as when a group of musical connoisseurs attended a concert by Umm Kulthum and when Dead Heads gathered for a concert of the hippie house band. Also, the spiritual opening through deep sama'a listening of an Arabic ensemble is not different than that that may occur by listening to some J S. Bach compositions or a Mahler symphony. Racy discusses the interactions of band leaders and players and the factors leading to both an inspiring and inspirational performance, when composition, improvisation, musicians, audience, and event situation come together in a stunning, magical way. Thus, although the details of compositions and poetic lyrics, terminology, history, and ethos presented in the book are unique to Arabic culture, there are also universals that can be appreciated by all peoples.Still, this is a thorough analysis of the Arabic musical idiom and the musical culture of its people. It is the richness of this examination that makes this book special and worthwhile. I find it a perfect companion to Scott L. Marcus' survey book, Music in Egypt.

In the 1980s, Michael Torke came onto the classical musical scene as a breath of fresh air: pieces that were popularly appreciated, emotional, rhythmic AND lyrical, and brief that lent themselves to ballet. This was his color music, his ecstatic music. But time goes on and the artist ages, develops, matures, and reevaluates. The works here of 1998 to 2001 have a different agenda: the journey, the ritual, and transcendence. Even so, Torke still revolves around joy, and An American Abroad can be viewed as the adventure and satisfaction of traveling, meeting challenges, witnessing novel sights, people, and events, and reflecting on them with nostalgia. A romantic mystic quest begins with such a trek. Jasper, the second work of this album, honors creativity itself, the ceaseless production of variety from permutations and combinations, here of a single melody. Jasper is quartz that may vary in hue, typically in warm reds, yellows, and browns. Rapture is attained through percussion, like the shaman's drum, and after letting go to the rhythm and to the sound, a new perspective opens. The Concerto for Percussion and Orchestra is another journey. Its music is a bright dance, a romp, an absorbing ritual of rhythm. Colin Currie, a member of the Steve Martland band, performs all the percussion, a noble feat, meaning drums, wood blocks, marimba, bells, cymbals, and other metallic percussive instruments. Alsop conducts the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with flair. I like this middle-aged Torke. The fun continues.

Very few recordings of indigenous Brazilian and Amazonian Indians are available, and this particular one, originally issued in 1989 and reissued in 2000, is again out of print. The Bororo people are from the 1,000-foot uplands of south-central Brazil near Paraguay in Mato Grosso. This ethnographic documentary recording centers on a funeral, which lasts days and includes chants, games, and a closing hunt. Rattles are the main instrument, although a dull drum and flute are also used. Bull-roarers are part of a rite. The longest track is also the most interesting, lasting almost 42 minutes, composed of excerpts of a day-long chant that includes many permutations(strophes) of syllables. Because of the variation, the track does not become tedious. These natives and those of other regions had a small but important influence in the general music of Brazil, of which European, Portuguese, and especially West African forms and instruments contributed. The notes explain the rites and offer extensive information on Bororo society, cosmology, instruments, and chants. The album may yet again be reissued, but until then, I recommend a search.

We have seen the "plot" before in the movie Kundun, a search for a rinpoche, a toddler who is a reincarnated great lama, who embodies his karmic momenta and memory. What is remarkable about this film is Tenzin Zopa, the monk attendant of the old lama who was assigned the task of finding the unique child with guidance of only some name letter clues from an astrologer in Taiwan (of all places!) and a directional pattern in the dust of the cremated lama. We can easily identify with monk Zopa, who feels himself inadequate for the important task. He speaks English well and his charm and sweet meekness help us as we follow him in his search. It leads to his own origins, his home valley...and is that not a fitting metaphor? This is no Nepalese Sherpa village along tourist trek paths, where I have been, but in the deep isolated boonies, where life follows the very ancient ways.Our doubts on the choice of the child come quick, despite the "coincidence" of starting letter in names of child and father: the shiny, crystal mala-rosary is attractive in its own way. Later, when the child is presented with choices among bells and dorjes and daruma drums, the child selects the correct, unassuming implements. Our eyebrows are raised and our own self-assurance is put into question.Aside from the parapsychological and metaphysical, religio-philosophical aspects, the film documentary itself as filmmaking is excellent. The scenery, the village and monastery people the monk encounters, the mountain hermitage and rose bushes, all seem to follow some Joseph Campbell mythological teaching. This is a highly educational, enjoyable, spiritual, anthropological film. [For the record, I saw the film on NetFlix.]

This extraordinary CD is everything the other reviewers had noted but more. The arrangements are all varied and invocative of other musical idioms while remaining Amazonian at its heart: Steve Reich's pulses, Terry Riley's syncopations, Mississippi blues, Navajo slow dances, Aleut mouth music, tropical forest ambiance and bird sounds, Bulgarian women's chorus. Each bend of the river provides surprises of new sounds, feelings, rhythms, patterns. Neither ethnographic field recordings nor cheesy pop tropical impressions, Miranda's music captures the wide scope of the native populations. And as the CD progresses, we feel going deeper into the land, farther away from urban influences. In short, this recording is magical, modern in its inventiveness yet ancient, and important both for preserving the spirit of the native peoples but also for ourselves. This recording will refreshen your life.

Of all the similar albums in honor of Patrick O'Brian's masterwork novels, this is the only one that is appropriate to the characters Doctor Maturin and Captain Aubrey, Royal Navy. Cello and violin pieces were not only a fundamental chamber duet but a Scottish folk duet as well, as continued today with Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas. These particular pieces were not mentioned in the novels, but I concur with the package notes that the scores could have been among those brought aboard H.M.S. Surprise and other vessels. Aubrey was actually a better musician than the doctor and kept at home a Guaneri, with shipboard instruments expendable and often mistuned from adverse weather. The musicians here, however, Mela Tenebaum violin and Yosif Feigelson cello, did not have to deal with high seas and produced fine, crisp recordings of duets by Fiala, Nardini, Firillo, Br&eacute;val, Platti, and more familiar Vivaldi and Stamitz. Thus, listen to this album while bringing forth the after dinner port and imagine yourself at the Captain's table. Happy sailing and avoid the Doldrums!

Ghost Beads. It is the inclusion of this tune among the collection of early Oregon on the Vanguard label that made me choose the album over the similar "Oregon: Best of the Vanguard Years," which include about half of the same tracks. These were the days when Collin Walcott was percussionist on tabla and also sitar, which he studied under the guidance of Ravi Shankar. The group had some of the same lyricism and tone of their colleages, the Paul Winter Consort, but mainly performed, unevenly, free jazz improvisations, which can be very interesting or tedious. I prefer their lyrical and rhythmic dances, such as Dust Devil, Sail, Tide Pool, and Ghost Beads. Paul McCandless's reeds, especially the oboe, overlaying Ralph Towner's guitar, creates moody atmospheres. The varied and contrasting timbre of instruments and the light, filigree arrangements were and remain key to Oregon's sound. After Vanguard and before ECM (after Walcott's death), the group went to Elektra and made the pivotal album "Roots in the Sky." These 71 minutes provide fine examples of the innovative jazz group's early explorations and demonstrate why they remain creatively active over 40 years. I still miss Walcott. ****1/2

This is an SACD multi-channel remastering of a 1994 CD album, and the sound is excellent. (The album, of 53 minutes duration, is playable on regular CD players, too.) Coming from the city of Traina, just across the Rio Guadalquivir from Sevilla, Carlos Heredia plays contemporary flamenco strongly rooted in traditional forms. Some chords and phrases, particularly in the tangos, are influenced by New World popular and jazz musics, but nothing is radical. It just sounds modern, which is part of the continual development of flamenco. Heredia is supported by palmeros (hand clappers), cajon percussion, acoustic bass, and an 18-year old cantaor, whose voice, while boyish, is still powerful and emotive. The lyrics are not provided, but a brief glossary is included. Heredia's performance is very fine and inventive. Having come freshly from Andalusia, this album continues my musical experiences and reminds me of another young guitarist of the Heredia clan I met in Granada. Carlos Heredia's style, his musical voice, is unique and refreshing. He found a middle position from the classical forms and the very jazzy improvisations in flamenco nuevo.

This extensive anthology of studio, music room, and field recordings from the Indus valley in Pakistan presents Sufi hymns, ghazals, ragas, folk dhuns, and tunes in honor of Sufi saints and masters. The last track is a drum duet. Because each track is surprising different from the next, with various melodies, rhythms, timbre of instruments, and singing style, the listener develops a broad appreciation of this religious music. Instruments include the surando and sarangi bowed lutes, the upper register benu flute, ektara string drones, the reeded alghoza that plays both drone and melody, tabla and dhol drums, and harmonium. Individuals, qawwali ensembles, and the qalandar and fakirs, the wandering dervishes, are featured. Having long experience in formal meditative classical Hindustnai music, I find this traditional Sufi folk music taking the opposite spiritual approach. It is bright, stirring, and enjoyable. Exuberant dancing, part of the Sufi outpouring, and the singing of romantic religious poetry can lead to delight, ecstasy, and perhaps union with The Beloved, the Divine. Disk 1 is 72 minutes, Disk 2 is 73 minutes. This is a splendid collection.

Like choro pioneer Jacob do Bandolim, Pereira da Viola (Jose Rodrigues Pereira) takes his professional name from his instrument. The Brazilian viola is a 10-string, double-five, guitar with metallic strings. It has a distinctive timbre that is associated with acoustic country music. da Viola is a popular composer and folk singer from the state of Minas Gerais, and his songs concern nature, poverty, and rural life in the Brazilian interior. His songs and those of Josino Medina are featured here, the latter sometimes singing and playing the violo, which is a 7-string acoustic guitar. Clave percussion is also included on some tracks. The 36-minute album also has Fernando Guimares and Cleyton Vetromilla on second violo. Lyrics in Portuguese are provided. The music is pleasant, sometimes happy, sometimes serious, sometimes romantic. The spectrum of Brazilian music is as wide as that of the United States, and this contemporary folk music helps broaden our appreciation of the richness of music beyond the urban centers of samba, bossa nova, and forr&oacute;.

Hua-Yen philosophy is the ancient Asian form of process metaphysics that in the West was championed by Whitehead. Hua-Yen is easier to grasp than Whitehead, but it still is a tough nut until the reader stops thinking in terms of objective things and more in the no-thingness of verbs and gerunds. Cleary's other book, the full Flower Ornament Sutra [Avatamsaka Sutra], which is the predecessor of Chinese Hua-Yen and whose excerpts are included in this introduction, may be more useful, though the best introduction is Francis Cook's. This book does give us the writings of commentators and the masters of this philosophy: Tu Shun, Cheng-kuan, Chih-yen, and especially Fa-Tsang. As a scientist, I subscribe fully to Hua-Yen and as a Korean Zen Buddhist, I find this philosophy as a powerful basis of meditative practices. The mutual arising and interpenetration of phenomena, as in Indra net of jewels, is not some obsolete way of thinking but is useful today in modern theoretical physics and the many feedback loops of the greater organizations and categories of matter. Consider this book as supplemental yet essential to other books on Hua-Yen.

This new edition of an earlier 2002 release is worth all its honors by the BBC and the French Victorire de Jazz and CHOC de l'ann&eacute;e du monde la Musique. The productive Esbjorn Svensson Trio's Scandinavian sound is more traditionally jazz rooted and more gentle and suave than the sparse European free jazz associated with ECM and explains in part why we find this recording on SONY/Columbia. Here is a very tight, technically innovative, clever group of musicians whose strong lyricism and sense of fun pervade the album's 65 minutes. All the musicians have a light staccato touch. Not every jazz group can claim to produce beauty but E.S.T.'s Serenade for the Renegade, for instance, has that quality beneath the bolero repetition and electronica. In the title track, my ears honed in on bassist Dan Berglund wide-angled playing and the occasion sound of the pedal-tempered piano. This is a complex, well-developed composition. The longest track, Behind the Yashmak, a bright and propulsive piece, comes to a sudden screeching stop at the peak of the crescendo. What follows is an exhale, a slow reflection. Next, Years of Yearning, is an appropriate dark work, with dissonance, muffled drums, and tearful melancholia. From the gloom arises a piano bass oscillating run leading into a bowed bass and hot hopscotching piano melody line. A boogie blues follows with a grand bass solo and spanking drum and cymbal work. Warning: The final track, Carcrash, has a false ending; 13 minutes are yet to go, with a gap of three minutes of silence! Then a noisy, machine-like pounding, buzzing, cacophony ensues for nine minutes, and at last a quiet closing section of drones, a bass solo, and bell-like electronica is heard as the melody moves toward the heavens and fades out. Five years later, the Portico Quartet repeated the stunt in their own final track, Pompidou. If you, as I, are new to the group, ended with Svensson's death, take advantage of the bargain price and appreciate their pioneering sound.

Dave Brubeck is 90 years old and still performing concerts. His discography has always been extensive but, remarkably, it continues to grow, not through new recordings but by CD reissues of long unavailable LPs and rummagings from the archives of studio and concert dates. On December 14, 1953, Brubeck's young first quartet (with Ron Crotty on bass and Joe Dodge on drums), who were making the rounds of colleges, did a 90-minute set at the College of the Pacific. The producer chose six pieces for an album, the remaining master tapes remaining on the shelves. Why those particular tunes were selected over others is not known for certain, as all works were standards, but Laura, I'll Never Smile Again, and I Rememeber You were very popular at that time. This second volume presents some enduring jazz standards, including Stardust, Crazy Rhythm, and How High The Moon, and from our more contemporary perspective, the list is superior. The performances certainly are as good as those of Volume 1, and while the engineering of the period was comparatively thin and shallow, the remastering is clean and more rounded. Even more important is the exceedingly high energy and brilliant improvisation. These are live recordings, and the interaction of enthusiastic audience and artists lifted the moment. If you have Volume 1, you will want the this album to complete the set and prolong the enjoyment of a Brubeck milestone.

The potential purchaser should know that this CD, originally of Japanese issue, is composed of fine field recordings of traditional instrumental and vocal music of Mongolians living in Mongolia and also Inner Mongolia, a province of China. The ethnomusicologist was Haruo Hasumi. The variety of selections provide an extensive introduction to the musical idioms of the region, with the chordal throat singing of khuumei; the morin kuur horse-head fiddle of cello range; the erh-hu-like khuuchir; the Mongolian banjo called a shraga; the yatag zither; and shawns and jew's harp. The performances are both folk and professional, solo and ensemble. This CD is an excellent choice to complement the CDs of professionally produced artists.

Already a fan of Le Vent du Nord, a group of four lads who perform with a fair number of guests, I was eager to hear this early album of Genticorum, a solid folk trio playing flute and bass; guitar and jew' harp; and fiddle, along with feet tapping. They too include guest musicians on some tracks, another foot tapper, a fiddler, and a player of the nyckelharpa, which is a sort of Swedish hurdy-gurdy fiddle. As for the music itself, it is sweet, rhythmic, and gentle, full of joy and mirth. Celtic jigs, reels, dancing ballads, and other happy tunes fill out a splendid album encased with smiles. They do not have the bright propulsion of the mentioned fellow qu&eacute;becois, perhaps a result of a fourth member and some different sonic engineering, but instead their own sound is more pleasant, soft, and relaxed. I had a fine time listening to their vocal harmonies, the call and response, and their instrumentals. You will too, I have no doubt. The album lasts 54 minutes, with 12 tunes.

Recognizable male choral sounds are found in Russia, the nation of Georgia, and Corsica. They are as distinctive as Gregorian chant. The polyphony of Corsica, until recently, has been a male domain. The men would gather in a horseshoe, often an ear cupped with hand, and sing both lithurgical and secular tunes traditionally without instrument accompaniment. The group A Filetta is the most recorded. This album presents the six men of Voci de Corsica. There is much dignity in their songs, but after a while tedium sets in, since the rhythm and tone of the many somber sacred hymns and laments are nearly uniform. Joy and celebration seems lacking. Still, this is fine recording and demonstration of the vocal art of Corsica.

I first encountered Lorraine Hunt Lieberson at the San Francisco Symphony's performance of Mahler's 2nd, in which her aria stopped time. I found myself quietly weeping, and looking around, I was not alone with teary eyes. The recording of that symphony night does not have the same effect, though it is still wonderful. But on this CD, when I listened to her sing these poetic Spanish songs put to music by her husband, again I am moved to the depths of my very being. Her death was a tragic loss but her sublime vocal powers are preserved here for us to experience. Excellent musical composition, profound poetry, great orchestral performance, heavenly singing: this is musical art at the highest level.

Take a fiddle, guitar, hurdy-gurdy, and concertina; add Celtic tuneful dances; mix with New World frontier spirit; flavor with French pride; sing in synchronous harmony; and perform like there is no tomorrow: what you get is a recording to bring smiles. Lively pieces are mixed with quiet reflections. Many of the tracks are based on 18th- and early 19th-century French folk tunes; others originated in French Canadian soil. This is fun music. Enjoy!

This first album by Emilio Maya is of modern, contemporary flamenco, nicely studio recorded in Granada. [Caveat: this review may have been influenced by my hearing him play with other musicians at a juerga in a cave above Granada, so give it ****1/2.] Maya's fine fingerwork and expansiveness are much in the style of Paco de Lucio and Manolo Sanl&uacute;car, yet his traditional flamenco grounding has come from his accompaniment of singers Enrique Morente, Marina Heredia, and Estrella Morente and many dancers. He performs here the more Celtic and Hispanic American-associated musical styles, the rumba, minera, tango; the Moorish-like zapateado and ronde&ntilde;a; as well as fast gypsy core alegrias and buler&iacute;as. There are other influences, and although Maya once said, "I don't do pop or anything weird," a cello and electronic bass do make their appearance. For some tracts, Maya performs with cantaors and palmeros. While he honors flamenco's history and traditional sound, he recognizes that the form -- rooted in the diverse multi-cultural styles of early Spain -- to live and grow must interact with other modern styles. Thus, he explores and adopts but keeps one foot within the tradition. The album, however, is only 35 minutes. I hope that next CD will be longer and, as I witnessed, with extended tracks with a cantaor.

With a haunting, pure, sensual voice, Amina Alaoui provides a portrait of cosmopolitan, tolerant Al-Andalus or Sefarad, Moorish Spain, a fabled era and place when religious and ethnic communities shared romantic culture, philosophy, medicine, poetry, and, here, music. The flow and exchange of European folk, Arabic, Berber, and Jewish musical modes and tunes and rhythms were common. This album features songs in Arabic, French, Spanish, and Hebrew (with lyrics provided respectively in those languages). In a chambered setting, she is accompanied by two musicians: Henri Agnel, who plays medieval guitar, cittern lute, and rebec along with frame drums, and Brijan Chemirani, performing on zarb, daf, and tambourine drums. The sound is mainly gentle with only occasional more lively, dancelike tracks. The arrangements are simple. Half way into the album, a mild tedium of sound and timbre sets in. While the minimalism is probably reflective of the era, 62 minutes is a long time for this particular musical meditation. Aside this minor complaint, the album is beautiful and educationally worthy. The title, Alcantara, is metaphoric, meaning bridge and derived from the Arabic, Al-Qantarah. Musicians are without borders and music itself is the message.

Having long known about the nigun, Jewish vocalise, I always wondered about its origins and the reasons for its use in Jewish mysticism. All religions apply music, but it seems more important among Chassids, African-American churches, and the Sufis. Rabbi DovBer Pinson has written the equivalent of Hazrat Inayat Khan's writings on the mysticism of music and of sound. In very clear prose and with documented details, he explains how the nigun captures the heart and how, when sung, it manifests the spiritual state, as much as brush calligraphy displays the attainments of a Zen monk. Harking back the lone shephard's song or flute, he demonstrates the need and spiritual longing of such spontaneous music. While the section on Kabbalistic metaphysics and categories was less useful, the many rabbinic tales offered as examples were fascinating and full of deep wisdom. I also was pleased to learn about the two main orders of Chassidism, the intellectual path of Chabad, with its more reserved nigunim and movements, and the Chagas, who follow the path of emotion and who dance and sing with more abandon. That Chassids recognize both slow, steady awakening and sudden attainment is akin to the different schools of Zen. This book is filled with rich lore, and having read it while listening to an album of nigunim, I was left in a happy state. The book tapped into my ancient roots. This is an important book in ethnomusicology and Jewish history.

This is a different "best of" anthology of Glykeria, another one-name superstar. Although other Greek singers may have a smoother or more angelic voice, she has character and a powerfully interpretative and pleasing quality. The musical arrangements and musicans backing her do not dominate yet are as important to the success of a recording as the various ensembles who supported another master and voice, Sinatra. Here, they all are perfectly balanced in supporting the vocalist. This CD is bookended with two symphonic, mainly strings, accompaniment, and between she covers various Greek musical forms, from modern urban tavern and popular compositions to old Asian-influenced rembetica. One listening makes you interested, two sessions leave you enchanted, thirsty for more of her recordings. The price from ARC of England makes the recording affordable and more readily available. Discover why Glykeria is a major star in Greece....and Israel.

[Samples of this follow-up recording to the 1997 Sony (Spain) album, Ritual Sufi-Andalusi: Poemas del m&iacute;stico grandino Al-Shustari (1212-1269)...SK 62999, may be heard on the Amazon UK site, where a couple more new copies may be obtained at this time of review.]This album under the musical direction of Omar Metioui and production guidance of Spanish medieval musicologist Eduardo Paniagua is of Moroccan or, broadly, Andalusian Sufi music song performed by 17 members of the Sufi Al-Shustari Fraternity in Tangiers. The musical instruments sometimes accompanying the singers are oud, nay, violin, viola and drums. The listener will immediately recognize the very pleasant Moroccan intonation in the chants and poetic recitations. The typical package insert by Eduardo Paniagua is full of information about the particular works and also a background on Sufi mysticism, several brotherhoods in Morocco, and aspects of inspiring Sam&aacute; songs within the Dhikr devotional meeting. As with the Sony release, this recording is well engineered, with a good sense of depth within the chamber. The Sony album is longer and a more spiritually effective dikhr for me, but this album is very fine nonetheless and it ends powerfully with the last track. Thus, beyond Arabo-Andalusian classical numbia modes and the performance of diwan, far different from the Afro-Moroccan gnawa trance music, and somewhat similar to the Sufi music of Egypt and the Middle East is this deep Sufi Andalusian music from Morocco. Beautiful. Search it out!

Several cajon and Louisiana musical anthologies are readily available, including one from Putumayo (which contains the same track with The Jambalaya Cajun Band) and other Rough Guides. This particular one is an excellent introduction, as it covers various styles and rhythms and focuses on dance pieces. The enclosed notes covers briefly the history of the people and music and also biographical information of the performers with photographs. Cajon music centers on accordion, voice, and fiddle and strong two-step and waltzes; it is also a music where the triangle once was the strong percussive instrument, though there is only one example here (track 14, the Balfa Brothers). Just as Canada has its French-Celtic folk music, from Quebec, the United States enjoys its own French-language folk style of the Acadians/Cajuns. The music is entirely unique, an amalgamation of French, Anglo-Celtic, Native American, Spanish, and both Northwestern and Central Western African thourgh the node of New Oreleans. Most of the tracks are from Rounder and Arhoolie Records, a good source for those who desire to focus on older traditional musicians. The album conveys the rural atmosphere of small towns, swamps, fishing villages, and dark woods. The lyrics are, as other American country tunes, of loves won and lost, of hardships and of cultural pride. The album provides 60 minutes of Cajon musical cuisine. The Putumayo anthology is slightly more contemporary in sound, and somehow brighter, though it shares many of the same musicians as this collection. Why not get both?

An early album and still the best for me, this trio recording is great jazz. Backed by the major rhythm section of Kenny Washington on drums and Peter Washington on bass, Bill Charlap's piano work is elegant. We hear beautiful renditions from the Great American Songbook of Cole Porter, Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, Frank Losser, and the Gershwins plus a tune from Charlap's father, Moose. I feel as if I were sitting at a nearby table in New York club, the studio engineering providing such an intimate sound. Charlap has fine phrasing and a keen sensitivity to the unsung lyrics. The overall mood is relaxed with only a couple up-tempo pieces (On a Slow Boat to China seems to be a fast clipper); the conveyed time of day is evening to late at night. I allow the music to flow through and envelop me and all is good with the world. These musicians interact well and together they have produced a truly sophisticated album.

This famous Cuban folkloric group plunges the depths of rhumba with a spectacular live percussive exposition. The sound of this concert recording is outstanding. My head is spinning trying to decipher the layers of rhythm, other than the bass drum with its classic rumba beat. Arising from the even deeper and older ritual music of Africa, the simplicity of voice behind the pure percussion enchants and entrances. The audience is appreciative and you will be too. All the son and modern Afro-Cuban jazz can be seen arising, in part, from this core, the spiritual heart. As with many live recordings, the excitement of the event pervades.

Simply put, Melina Kana is a great Greek vocalist and this album must be part of your world music collection. For those who want more than words of review, and owing to the absence of samples for "Portait" here, I suggest you listen to Amazon's .mp3 Digital Album, an anthology of her other songs. You will then discover that this Portrait album is even better! It is stronger, more beautiful, and more varied. Kana's songs and sensitivity are steeped in classic melancholy rembetika and tragic laiko, while not strictly in those styles. English translations of the songs are provided in the accompanying booklet, which will strengthen the moods as you listen. Fascinating lyrics, too, such as "An aspirin and a coffee/And then two cigarettes/This evening the souls/Creak uphill/Like rusty carts"; "Melancholy days, heavy drops of rain/Fall on pills and bottles/I seek no comfort/In films and books"; "At night and in the morning/Your love became a bitter torture/It turned into a song, into a plea,/Becoming the truth in my world of illusion". And that is just a taste. Kana has reached out to other Mediterranian influences, Rumanian gypsy music, and also to Turkmenistan in Central Asia; their rhythms and instrumentation can be heard on some tracks. These later tracks also are more upbeat and contemporary in sound. This is a well-edited, well-mastered, outstanding collection on the German Network label taken from her recent albums on Lyra, an indigenous Greek label. Duration is 69 minutes.

Nominated deservedly for Record of the Year for the 9th Native American Music Awards, Morningsong's Out of the Ashes is fitting to her name, as fresh as a dawn mountain breeze singing through the trees. This recording is simply outstanding, both by its touching lyrics and its rocking, powerful yet sensual arrangements. This CD crosses more musical territory than many of the Native American genre, and I would not be surprised to hear it someday on more enlightened popular radio [NPR at least]. And its gets even better on repeated listening. Do what the other reviews suggest: listen to it, buy it, and soar as an eagle.

Morocco and Andalusian Spain are world crossroads. The music of Morocco especially is extraordinarily varied with many styles and influences, including those of indigenous Berbers, the Black peoples of Mali and Senegal (the gnawa), modern French-Europop singers, classical Moorish Iberian set pieces, and Arabs. There have been centuries of fusions. While many recordings are available of Arabo-Andalusian music, Berber and Gnawa music, Sufi songs, and so forth, traditional Arabic songs of Morocco have been lacking. This CD fills the gap admirably. The powerful rhythms are of rocking camels in caravans, the songs are call-and-response, and the clapping patterns are certainly the root of flamenco's palmas. The music is not really restricted to Morocco and "North Africa" in the title is indeed proper, for the sound can be heard from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. If you like Hamza el Din's recording, Eclipse, you will enjoy this recording.

Flutes, drums, rattles, and a strong, haunting rhythm, a cumbria, that reaches back, back in time: such is the opening of this powerful folk album from Colombia. San Jacinto, where the group of musicians dwell, is somewhat inland on the Caribbean side of the country. The historic music of Spanish, Africans, and native Indians together influenced the development of the various forms of this regional folk music. Sometimes Africa dominates, sometimes Andean or Amazonian Indian musical roots are apparent. Besides cumbria, the album features puya, porro, gaita corrida, and bullerengue dances. Specifically, we hear two rather long duct flutes, maracas, three types of drums, and one small transverse flute fashioned with a split piece that vibrates on inhaling and exhaling. A solo singer with a coarse, impassioned voice is sometimes backed by the chorus of instrumentalists in call and response. When, in the track El Corcovado (The Wood Quail), the flutes enter, I recall the mysterious long flutes of Albania and of Papua New Guinea, but I conjure an image of Indians in a imitative avian dance; it is an old composition. The swaying, more Spanish, rhythm of the following porro leads to African drumming of the puya, and so on. Listening to the extraordinary album is as if traveling back in time, though this music is alive and well this very moment albeit increasingly limited to festivals and university music programs. Thus, this Smithsonian-Folkways album is important, indeed worthy of its awards, and will further interest in the folk music of Colombia and its traditions.

This album of field recordings from the late 1970s includes Jensey, an unusal fire ceremony. Fire rites are paramount in Zoroastrianism, of course, but may be found also in Chinese traditional ceremonies as well. In Japan, the Tendai tantric sect has an elaborate fire rite. Most fire rites are for purification and meditative concentration; in this instance, Jensey is for the memory of departed kin and friends. Another selection celebrates the birthday of Padma Sambhava, the legendary figure who brought Buddhism to the Tibet. Sites of recordings are Tahijon and Bir in Tibet, Rumtek in Sikkim, and at Ghoom Monastery in west Bengal. These are excerpts of the various chants. The sound quality is not too bad, compared to Bhattacharya's other recordings of Tibetan rites on the ARC label. Although many other, far better, albums are available of Tibetan religious rites, this is only one which I am familiar that presents the fire rite, and thus this recording is worthwhile for the collector. You can hear the crackling of wood and offerings in the fire.

If you are familiar with the vibrator lever and the wah-wah pedal on an electric guitar, consider that the Vietnamese had it first, since circa 13th century and established at the imperial court in Hue in 1896. The dan bau is a single-stringed instrument with flexible handle of water buffalo horn and is plucked with a bamboo rod. The glissando effect is characteristic of Vietnamese music, even in singing. The musician must be able to stretch the string with precision, as the trombonist must learn where to move the slide for particular notes. This album features this unique instrument performed by Phan Duc Thanh. The other instruments heard in accompaniment, such as the dan tranh zither, dan nhi fiddle, and percussion, thanks to multi-track editing, are also played by him. Musical tracks cover north, central, and south regions with romantic songs, work songs, and a children's tune. This one-person project misses the improvisational and individualistic advantages of an ensemble. Arrangements may have been better with other musicians. The album, however, highlights the special, sad timbre and art of the monochord. Its sound is unforgettable.

Bebop marks the transition between swing and progressive jazz following World War II and includes the origins of Latin jazz. Dizzy Gillespie was among the revolutionaries of the transition. This album is a 24-track, 72-minute collection of his recordings between 1946 and 1949. Retrospectively, they are extraordinary milestones: powerful, pioneering, and portentous. Here are his great hits--52nd Street Theme, Night in Tunisia, Manteca and other Afro-Cuban tunes of congo and bongo drumming. We hear in his bands Milt Jackson, Ray Brown, James Moody, John Lewis, Kenny Clarke, Chano Pozo, and Yusef Lateef, among other stars. You certainly get your money's worth. This album is an excellent historical addition to your jazz collection. [Note that this item is the very same anthology as the more expensive CD of the same name and cover on Amazon.]

Recorded in Berlin in 1992, these pieces, based on raga modes, are performed on numerous unusual but traditional folk instruments of southern Pakistan: a surando, which is sarangi-like fiddle; an ektara, which resembles a long-necked erhu and serves as a drone; a danbura, which is a pair-shaped, saz-like lute; an alghoza double reed, which plays both melody and drone; a benu, being a bamboo flute; harmonium; and finally a dholak two-faced drum. Accompanied by singers, the timbre rests in the treble range, and the engineering does not help by its distant flatness, though the sound is very clear. With dances, tales, a wedding song, and instrumentals, this German prize-winning album does present the Sufi spirit from a area poorly represented among available recordings. If you know only of Qawwali Pakistani Sufi music and its bright, rhythmic songs of harmonium, voice, and clapping, you will appreciate this 73-minute long album and its different instruments and feeling.

Marina Heredia was dissatisfied with this album. It may have been song selection and its popular arrangements, but for me it is still a very fine recording, produced by Pepe de Lucia, brother of Paco. Marina Heredia is daughter of El Parr&oacute;n, Jaime Heredia, and comes from the Sacromonte district of Granada, a center of flamenco. Perhaps she did not like all the up-tempo pieces, which are tangos, rumbas, buler&iacute;as, a taranto and an alegr&iacute;a. Her subsequent album was more intimate and varied in tempo. Lyrics are included in the notes and credits. Various other musicians provide traditional flamenco guitar, palmas, and percussion. Electric bass guitar and chorus are also present. Her voice style is contemporary smooth and suited for ballads. Together the album has a modern, popular feeling but not jazzy flamenco nuevo. She is true to her deep roots.

The premiere of Pacifika Ronda, the first work on this collection of diverse small works by Lou Harrison, took place in 1963. This was long before interest in 'world music,' which blossomed with rise of the hippie movement, before Nonesuch was issuing its first Explorer series, before World Pacific jazz discovered that Japanese koto and Indian sarod music had an audience in the United States. Classical composer Harrison, however, was already interested in Indonesian scales and rhythms, inheriting the legacy of Colin McPhee. He was exploring other Asian sounds, and indigenous Meso-American sounds. Thus, in Hawai'i, already a very Pacific state of many residents of Asian heritage, the strange music with unusual instruments was well received. Here was a performance of music that adapted Korean piri reed and chango drum, Chinese zheng zither and fang hsian metallophone, Japanese daiko drum and sheng/sho reed mouth organ. The music is stately as gagaku of the Japanese court, peaceful as a Buddhist temple in a Chinese forest, flowing as rain in Bali, as wild as an Aztec ritual. It was not traditional music, and indeed some of the instruments were Western in design and construction, but it conjured the exotic Orient and Amer-Indian cousins nonetheless. Harrison was a lyrical composer whose instrumental palette was as rich as experimentalist Harry Parch's. The one track that sticks out as a sore thumb is a 12-tone Cold War statement of the nuclear threat and militarism. Fortunately, the final track takes us away from the brink to a pond of majestic, kind dragons. Thus, already in 1963, Harrison had laid the foundation for his 1972 masterpiece La Kora Sutra.The second composition was for harp, consisting of four lovely, sweet melodies: a serenade; a Medieval-like troubador piece with percussion; a quiet reflection; and a festive, sparkling honor of the diety of compassion, Avalokiteshvara, with bell ornamentation. The psaltery pieces were performed in the Chinese style; the instruments were constructed on the Chinese zheng model. Indeed, it is difficult to tell if it were not a traditional Chinese recording. The final piece is for Violin with Various Instruments, and as its 1967 vintage suggests, it has a global vision. Its three movements are percussive with violin melody. Drums, strumming harp, and African mbiras sandwich a thoughtful largo of violin and drone. The arrangements reminded me of a rebab in a Javanese gamelan. Musicians on this album include Lou Harrison himself on piri; Helen Rafas, harp; William Bouton, violin; William Colvig, zheng and fang hsian; and the Oakland (California) Youth Orchestra. Together, these works are a good introduction to the prolific joyous compositions of a major maverick classical composer.

On this Milestone Records release we hear true flamenco jazz from Madrid and Cadiz. The tunes are composed by Paco de Luc&iacute;a and Ram&oacute;n de Algeciras and arranged and performed by Jorge Pardo on saxophone and flute, Chano Dominguez on piano, with support of Javier Colina, bass, and Tino de Gerado and Luis Dulzaides on percussion. Palmas and vocals are by Conchi Heredia and El Conde. This is not fusion, nor Spanish style, nor jazz-influenced flamenco, but great improvisational jazz with a flamenco heart. All the musicians are outstanding. Prado's flute and saxophone take flight and are exciting; Dominguez's piano work is rich, sophisticated, and elaborate; Colina's bass is strong, sometimes taking the melody. Other than a couple slow tracks, in which Prado's flute transforms into an Arabic ney or Dominguez has an extensive solo, the beat masters keep the energy high. This happy, intense album of 62 minutes is a delight. It makes you want to dance, stamp your feet, rotate your wrists, and shout ol&eacute; in approval.

1924 to 1928: years of these tracks and when the phonograph was the latest technology. Records, along with radio, were an effective mass communication for cultural change. Musical styles and the particular sounds of musicians were able to be heard across states and regions. Therefore, forgive the thin sound of these historic recordings. (I suggest putting on some headphones to examine them closely.) Here is Ma Rainey, already a well-established professional theater and tent popular singer of what became the blues, as this was the cusp between turn-of-the-century rags and the jazz age. Indeed, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Green, and Coleman Hawkins are on some tracks. Nearly all the tunes are blues by title. The arrangements are for early jazz band, often with piano or banjo and tuba, and even kazoo. Rainey's professionalism is readily apparent. Her husky voice manifests emotion and strength, and it is no wonder why these recordings firmly established the blues. 72 minutes, 24 tracks.

This film, shown recently on MHz TV network, is in Hungarian, Polish, and Yiddish, but with English subtitles. For this Hungarian film, taking place in Cracow, Poland, to have a Jewish theme and music, including a track of Michael Alpert and Brave New World, was a surprise. The restoration of a rabbi's cemetery headstone initiates some movie magic and allegorical wisdom. Romance is balanced by crime and some uncivil behavior. There is even a Fellini-esque circus scene. This small, quiet film eventually engages the viewer and leaves strong, positive memories.

In search of the true feeling within a nigun, Jewish vocalise sung as an outpouring of spiritual depth, I have been largely disappointed. Some albums of Shlomo Carlebach, Mike Tabor, and Joel Rubin only approach that heart, though they offer fine music and some worthy and interesting innovations. When I heard again my copy of this purely instrumetal Andy Statman album, I was stunned. Here it was! Through jazz! Statman captures and blends Chabad Chassidism, klezmer joy, and spiritual jazz (with its roots of blues and religion). He even throws in some bluegrass via guest Jewish musicians Bela Fleck, banjo, and David Grisman, mandolin. Here is an album to place along those of Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, and Charles Lloyd. Between Heaven and Earth is a milestone, unique among klezmer, and as the title indicates, the listener is drawn away from mundane affairs toward the essence of our existence. Here is beauty. Here is wrapped the history of Jewish exile. This is quite an accomplishment for a small klezmer band.

Selim Sesler is a virtuoso of the clarinet and his ensemble are all excellent musicians; his son B&uuml;lent Sesler plays kanun. (I saw both of them perform two weeks ago.) This Traditional Crossroads album of 2000, licensed from Turkish Kalan Music, is excellent from its music to its educational, historical, well-illustrated notes. Romani music, despite its many influences from the Balkans, Anatolia, Greece, and Arab nations to the southeast is unique in form and spirit. This album focuses on Thrace, that part of Turkey that lies within Europe, near Greece and Bulgaria. Its music sounds nothing like its neighbors, though Pomak-speaking groups from Greece had emigrated to this locale. Its strong drum beats, of the davul double-side drum, and complex 9/8 and 7/8 and 10/4 rhythm cycles coupled with clarinet [or zurna oboe] are celebratory for all the events in village life, such as weddings. There are dance and drinking tunes. Included in the ensemble are darbouka goblet drum, violin, kanun zither, clarinet, davul and daire/bendir drums, and the c&uuml;mb&uuml;s (pronouced joombush) that is a hybrid of a banjo and ud [other combinations with saz and guitar and ukelele are found]; it was invented in 1927 by Zeynel Abidin. Sesler was raised in Kesan, Thrace, and is heralded in Istanbul. The album is joyous and powerful. It would be a superb addition to a collection of world music, especially of gypsy and Turkish musics. Chances are very good that you have never heard music as this.

The group Lao Tafa, featuring the clarinet and leadership of H&uuml;sn&uuml;u Senlendirici, is contemporay Western fusion treatment of traditional Turkish tunes from various regions--the Aegean coast, the Black Sea, northwest near the Balkans, and Central Anatolia--as distilled by Romani musical arts. The musicians are from the inland Romani town of Bergama and the coastal large city of Izmir. Besides clarinet, the group includes davul bass drum, violin, kanun zither, baglama saz, keyboard, trumpet, electric bass guitar, and drum set. The musical arrangements are eclectic in approach, and at times we can hear jazz, other times turku folk forms, Arabic rhythms, and on further tracks familiar Romani styles. These, of course, are dance tunes. There is not a hint of Euro-pop, New Age electronica, rock, or rap, but rather we hear well-balanced, sophisticated arrangements. The band is regarded as experimental and innovative, but after spending a couple weeks in Turkey, including Bergama, listening to traditional village and Romani music, I can appreciate this group as the leading edge of modern mainstream Turkish music.

This double media shelving unit is better in appearance than I expected, despite the particle board and pseudo wood coating. Assembly was fairly easy. I keep the unit on the floor, but being in earthquake country, I use the back retaining support against the wall. The shelves, black in hue, were milled with grooves, making placement on the metal pegs secure downward and laterally. I decided not to include the top molding to allow easier access to the top row of CDs. The reasonable price is a bonus. In short, this is a good, well-made product that fully met my requirements.

Founded in 1986 by Burhan Sukarma, a master of the suling (the Sundanese, Indonesian, bamboo flute), Pusaka Sunda is a gamelan ensemble of mainly Western musicians living the San Francisco Bay Area. Often the group includes Undang Sumarna, the Sundanese drummer and university educator. These compositions are in the five-pitch Sundanese turnings, pelog degung and sorog, and are essentially short suites of simple melodies. Like other Javanese gamelan music, particularly court music, the metallophones and compositions are richly harmonic, and mainly stately and slow but often increase in speed toward the end of the piece. The music is not at all like the wildly bright and rapid gamelans of Bali. Even as dance compositions, the music is dreamy and calming. In this album two pieces respectively include a violin (which works seamlessly, as rebab fiddles are often included in Javanese gamelans) and a clarinet (whose timbre and pitch are somewhat jarring and 'off'). The recordings and mixing are excellent, and the bass gongs are not attenuated, as occurs in other CDs of Javanese music. You do feel the vibration. I recently attended a performance of this ensemble and the album matches the experience.

Moacyr Luz is composer, guitarist, and singer of samba, and this album showcases his talents. A traditional samba sound with fine supporting musicians (cavaquinho; surdo, pandeiro, and other percussion; trombone, flute, and clarinet; and vocals), the tunes are diverse, romantic and bright. Luz's co-composers include, depending on track, Wilson Moreira, Nei Lopes, Martinho da Vila, Palbo C&eacute;sar Pinheiro, Wilson Das Neves, and especially, with five songs, Aldir Blanc. Among his many albums, this one concentrates on core popular acoustic and sensual samba. This is feel-good gentle music, very similar to but tamer than the exuberant music of Jorge Arago. The spirit of Brazil is evoked and the listener will soon sway with the rhythm. This strong, sweet album will delight the dancer and fan of Brazilian music.

So taken with the Naxos collection of the string quartets of David L. Post, I desired other examples of his compositions and obtained this group of 20th-century pieces of Post, Romeo Melloni, and P. Peter Sacco. Post's Concerto for English Horn (1998) by the same solist and orchestra is available on another album, but I was more curious about the other two composers here. The English horn, a bass oboe, has a melancholy, bluesy tone compared to its sweet soprano sister. A concerto for English horn is a rare bird (Aaron Jay Kernis wrote another one, Colored Field). Post's lyricism, as in his quartets, is evident, but to accentuate the smoothness of the reed, played by Donna Marie Cobert, the first movement includes the sharp-edged sounds of a xylophone and a harp. The middle movement is playful and pastoral, and the work finishes wih a snare drum flourish. Melloni's three-movement symphony (1998) named for his wife, he admitted, is a collage in classical theme, variation, and rondo format. Harmony and excitement are the emphasis. Sacco's Violin Concerto No. 1 is a more serious, darker work, emerging out of his experience in the Korean War. It is the best work on this album, being coherent and with a powerful message. The middle movement's prayer leads to a rapid, somewhat optimistic close. Lydia Forbes' violin is heartfelt.

Yusef Lateef, who performed world jazz fusion before there was such a category and whose album Eastern Sounds is a masterpiece of the genre, displays his versatility in this CD. When he plays the tenor saxophone, he is the hard bopper who plays with strength and certainty. His oboe work shatters sound preconceptions. This is not the sweet, soft symphonic oboe or the lyrical oboe of Oregon's Paul McCandless, but the double reed of world folk traditions, with energy and openness. Hearing the blues on oboe is a kick! Lateef's flute, on the other hand, is inner directed and more reflective. We hear suggestions of Lateef's religious commitment through Asian themes. The celeste (pre-Herbie Hancock's electronic equivalent) adds color to the meditation. From a quiet flute track, Lateef closes with the somewhat jarring Ma-He's Making Eyes at Me on saxophone, probably to remind all that he is still the Detroit jazzman who played with Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie. Yusef Lateef is supported on this ablum by Ron Carter on cello instead of his usual bass, of which Herman Wright does the honors. Keyboards are provided by Hugh Lawson. Drums (including timpani) are played Lex Humphries.

This fine album sounds almost as if the Bushmen (San) were recorded in the, well, bush, so naturally traditional it seems, but the musicians were in the studio in Johannesburg, South Africa. The tunes relate to their primitive hunter-gatherer existence and their holistic environmental approach to life. Their instruments are fairly basic and, of course, portable: gourd and ankle shakers, drums, flute, bow with resonator, and thumb piano. The 35 short tracks, total of 72 minutes, become an enchanting suite. After a history of displacement and crueties, only some 7,000 San people remain in the central Kalahari, and to perserve their culture and art, the Qwii Music Arts Trust in Botswana supported these musicians and studio recording. The enclosed booklet includes photographs of instruments, rock art, huts, and hunting and gathering. The various timbre of the instruments, gentle rhythms, and happy group singing/yodeling make this album worthwhile listening.

Facing Spain is the port city of Tangier, Morocco. It is the home of one of the styles of medieval Andalusian music brought back from Moorish Spain, which is a prescribed suite of instrumentals and sung poems, often referred to as Arabo-Andalusian music. Performed here in concert, the ensemble includes artists who participated in flamenco vocalist Juan Pe&ntilde;a Lebrijano's brilliant interaction, Encuentros, and differs from many such groups in including women vocalists, in addition to cellos. Indeed, the enlarged orchestra has two oudists, a player of the rebab, two violins, and a viola, along with percussion. The particular suite, or nuba, one of eleven in the tradition, is in mode hijaz al-kabir. There is joy in this performance and a particularly lighter, smoother style than found on other recordings from Fes and other regions. Improvisations are subtle in the form of vocal ornamations and tempo changes. My only caveat is that in this large ensemble spread across the stage there is a tendency to lose synchronicity, the groove. On the other hand, it is a live performance and we sense the community of artists and appreciative audience sharing in the delightful music.

In the 1990s, producer, Gerard Kremer, with the aid of ethnomusicologist, Habib Yammine, visited the uplands of Yemen, particulary the city Sanaa, with a digital recorder, and found some worthy public events and willing musicians. Their album, part of the budget Air Mail Music series, consists in the main of field recordings. Beginning with early morning muezzins calling from loudspeakers, the series of pieces alternate with oud-accompanied songs and male dance rhythms beat on large metal cans and trays or, later, with drums and double-reeded shawms. As with most field work, the music is raw, hard, and vital. The listener does feel as if walking on some street hearing a musical ensemble. The tunes and rhythms, while having the common Arabic core structure, reflect the social geography of an ancient maritime trader of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea.

While the first and second volumes of these flamenco anthologies have most of the same artists, this first volume is special by including two tracks of guitarist Parrilla de Jerez [Manuel Fern&agrave;ndez Molina] accompanying cantaor Curro Malena [Francisco Carrasco Carrasco], two brilliant prize-winners. This album is among the very rare that feature them. Other positives include selections of cantaors La Paquera de Jerez and Manuel Jim&eacute;nez Rejano. On the negative side, for me, are three pieces from the overrated but historically important Manitas de Plata and two from the peculiar high voiced Pepe Nu&ntilde;ez "El Lore&ntilde;o". Together, the anthology does provide a good taste of mid twentieth-century flamenco, where so few are available. If you desire a variety of flamenco forms and artists, certainly obtain these two albums, but then explore further and deeper this evolving art form.

The Karnatic tradition of South India is associated with the veena, an ancient stringed instrument with melody and drone strings and a twangy timbre. Atypical of the budget Voyager series, this album cites the musicians, here two highly accomplished women. Rajaswarei Padmanabhan is the ninth generation of veena players in her family, and she is a professor in Madras, India. Her daughter, Shreevidhya Chandramouli, accompanies her on mridangram drum, and has taught at the University of Oregon and the University of Washington. Devotional melodies dominate such music, though classical ragas/ragam are also performed. Two tracks are composed by Mysore Vasudevachar, who died in 1961 after writing more than 200 pieces. The music of this recording are brightly cheerful (tracks 1 and 2), serious (tracks 3), and highly improvisational with a contemporary feel (track 4). This is a truly fine album. Considering that high quality solo veena albums are few, this Voyager issue, with over 65 minutes of music, is an excellent buy beyond the low price.

Other than the three old [1970s] volumes of Javanese Court Music reissued by Nonesuch and some long unavailable recordings from King Records in Japan, we have not had an album of full length pieces of formal Javanese court music in a long time. This budget album from Voyager is a fairly recent recording [1992] from Surakarta and is of high quality sound. It is 58 minutes in duration. Little explanatory text or credits are provided. The first work is a type of dance unique to the Surakarta Kraton [there are four Javanese courts] and is typically performed by four women; it is one of ten such styles of srinpi. This and the following gendhing, or pieces, are played on gongs, xylophones, vibrophones, flute, strings, and drum that compose a gamelan orchestra. The second piece is a classical composition associated with the Mahabarata; the third work, a dance, relates to a mythological epic of an undefeated commander. Since the performers are from the Indonesian Arts and Culture Academy, we hear professional musicians playing traditional compositions. Even though you will need to consult other recordings or the internet to learn about such music, the album itself is very fine. Mellow, flowing Javanese court music is different from the bright, fast gamelans of Bali and from the popular dance pieces of Sunda, on the western part of Java.

If it were not for Amazon's computer recommendations, I would not have known that this brilliant album is available...on mp3. [Since I am one of those whose ear and stereo hardware can distinguish mp3 from the better wav CD format, I normally do not look in the mp3 section.] This is a very fine album in both music and performance. The Brubeck team was continuing its unusual time explorations and improvised melodies, so key to this period of "progressive jazz". Except for one song, there are no catchy tunes, no memorable tour de force; instead, there is just superb playing and musical poetry, especially that smooth, unique sound of Paul Desmond. I would like to have those helpful liner notes found with CDs, but meanwhile all Brubeck fans should download the mp3 files for a surprisingly underrated album.

J. Scott Morrison's review of this album is very thorough, and I have little to add, except that I, too, am pleased with this accessible group of quartets with a strong American flavor. These rich works are complex in their energy and flow, of both emotion and intellect, and are highly engrossing. Kenneth Fuchs is largely conservative or traditional in his classical compositions. There is no wild experimentation, pulsing, or bombast. Instead, there is much melodic depth here. Quartets pose significant challenge for the composer in providing full interplay of the instruments; he accomplished this task remarkably well, and I warrant that the musicians truly enjoyed performing the works, that their smiles on the cover do indeed reflect the artistic and poetic spirit that inspired the music. As for me, there too is a smile on my face as I listen to these fine pieces. Encore! Encore!

Lead by pianist Adolfo, the quartet of musicians performs works by Chiquinha Gonzaga, 1847 to 1935, who herself was a pianist, composer, and conductor. An early foe of slavery and supporter of a republic, she left her comfortable life as wife of a naval administrator to dedicate herself to music. Creating a niche within the male-dominate society, she composed polkas, choros, and music for the theater and carnival. Adolfo with Gabriel Viva, bass, Ivan Conti, drums, and Claudio Spiewak, Brazilian guitar, honor this pioneer with jazz arrangements of her music. The tempo is fast with a syncopated ragtime feel, although one track is a romantic ballad in waltz time. The happy album was issued in 1997 for Gonzaga's 150th birthday. If you are curious about Brazilian music beyond samba, forr&oacute;, and bossa nova, take this Latin jazz ride into the past. Eleven tracks over 41 minutes.

The warmth of Cannonball Adderley's music is perceived in all his recordings, and his vocal introductions on his live sets are not obtrusive as they evidence his good nature. This return to San Francisco expanded the band to a sextet with the addition of Yusef Leteef, who brings world music and exotica into the mix, as the first tract Primitivo demonstrates. The major piece of the album, The Jive Samba, was from the outset a popular hit, and a section of it, previously issued as a single, made the popular charts. [Yes, jazz in 1963 was still a popular jukebox item (jukebox: a coin-operated device for playing 45 r.p.m. vinyl disks in public places).] The album showcases the various styles and talents of the group. Jessica's Days is a hard bop, brash, swinging tune from the pen of Quincy Jones; Marney, originated with Donald Byrd, sends the musicians into deep explorations; Unit 7, bassist Sam Jones' composition, has the thematic strength to remain the band's standard; Lille, also from Sam Jones, slows the tempo with a ballad; and Lateef's Mellow Buno is Ellingtonesque in its opening but expands to highlight the cornet of Nat Adderley and the swirling sound of the saxophones and Zawinuls' piano. The early 1960s is one of my favorite period of jazz history when musicians pushed out the edges of the familiar to new complexities and feelings. This album will again be reissued in a new cycle, but meanwhile a search is well worth the effort.
