This is one of the few Christmas specials that is still aired every year and is one that drove my mom crazy when I was young because she found Charlie Brown to be annoying. After forty-seven-years since it debuted, it still receives millions of viewers. It is one of the few cartoons that gives kids the real meaning of Christmas.

A Christmas Carol was my first buy through my Kindle that I received for Christmas last year. I've seen the countless film versions, but nothing beats reading the original novel about Scrooge.

My grandmother is to blame for introducing me to the Halloween franchise when I was a kid. She had the first three movies recorded off of television, in which I borrowed the VHS tape dozens of times. Halloween had a simple plot about a masked killer stalking a teenage babysitter on Halloween night. It could have easily been a dud, but thanks to John Carpenter and Debra Hill's intriguing screenplay and John's visual directing style, the move showed what true horror is. Unlike, the sequels and countless rip-offs, Halloween didn't need to rely on gore, nudity, and graphic language, but instead focused on the character study of Dr. Sam Loomis, played by the late Donald Pleasence, Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, and the killer himself, Michael Myers. Here, in the original, Michael is just a killer with no motivation, as the idea of Laurie being his sister wasn't introduced until the first sequel.I try to watch Halloween and the The Midnight Hour on Halloween night every year. John's creepy theme throughout the movie always gives me the creeps. Halloween is the best in the franchise, and one of the best slasher movies ever made.My DVD is the 25th Anniversary Edition (aka DiviMaX series) consisting of two discs.Disc One:Widescreen Presentation (2:35:1)Audio Commentary with Writer/Director John Carpenter; Jamie Lee Curtis, and Producer Debra HillDisc Two:Halloween - A Cut Above the Rest (87 minute documentary)On Location - 25 Years LaterTheatrical TrailerTV SpotsRadio SpotsPoster and Still GalleryTalent BiosDVD-ROM Original ScreenplayDVD-ROM Screen Savers

I never cared much for White Christmas when I was a kid, but as an adult, I have come to appreciate it, along with Holiday Inn. I bought the DVD of it a few years ago and it is now one my favorite annual movies to watch around Christmas. The songs are wonderful and the cast has great chemistry, especially during the musical numbers at the ending.Trivia: Vera-Ellen, who played Judy Haynes, did all her own dancing scenes, but she couldn't sing. All her singing numbers were dubbed by somebody else.

I was only a 10-year-old when this movie was released back in 1991 and I have fond memories of it. I'm surprised that the movie doesn't get very many favorable reviews, as it is one of my favorite holiday movies. The plot was simple - kids try to scheme their parents into getting back together on Christmas Eve.

Warner Bros. is continuing their lazy or should I say greedy streak in releasing The Smurfs to DVD. The could at least finish releasing Season 2, but instead they release a handful of episodes to DVD.The episodes are The Last Laugh, The A-maze-ing Smurfs, The Lost City of Yore, Johan's Army, and The Good, the Bad, and the Smurfy.Don't get me wrong, I liked all five episodes, but it annoys that Warner Bros. won't release more seasons sets.

I bought this game probably six or seven years ago. I found it in the Walmart game bin for around twenty dollars. I never opened it until recently when I found it covered with dust on a shelf. I started playing the game and played it straight through. The game level isn't very difficult to play once you figure out what is going on, but I absolutely love the game. This is the way Transformers' games should be!

Scarecrow is about a high school student who is tormented by his peers, his teachers, and his mother's boyfriend. Late one night, his mother's boyfriend murders the teen in a field near a scarecrow. The teen's soul possess the scarecrow and he wants revenge on his tormenters.The premise sounds interesting, but the movie is horrible to watch thanks to the bad acting, dialogue, and camera shots. The actor who plays the main character looks like he is 40 and the other teens look like they are closer to 30! All I could do was just laugh at the stupidity of the casting. I prefer to watch the sequelScarecrow Slayerover this garbage.

Evil Dead Regeneration picks up where the movie left off. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, but this time he gets a sidekick that is voice by Ted Raimi. I've been a big Evil Dead fan for probably twenty years, so I had to hunt down this game when it first came out because I couldn't find it in the stores. This was my first horror game that I have played and it is one my favorites to play despite a few minor game glitches. There is over-the-top blood and gore that should satisfy most horror fans.

It's nice to see The Borrowers get a big budget, as I don't care much for the television versions. If you are a fan of the books, you'll be disappointed that the movie ignores all the books' storylines and is more likeThe Littles. If you can watch it as is, it is actually an enjoyable family film. If you like The Borrowers, I recommend watchingThe Secret World of Arrietty.

This 1946 classic is aired annually on NBC, but I didn't watch it until the mid-90s when the country singer Garth Brooks was the host of it. I absolutely loved it and eventually bought the movie on VHS at a Best Buy the following summer. I later replaced it with the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD. To me, the movie is fast-paced despite its 130 minutes running time, and gives a great message.

Universal Soldier: The Return is set several years after the events that occurred in the first film. Luc Devereaux (played by Jean-Claude Van Damme) is no longer a Universal Soldier, but he does run the new advanced program for the government. The new soldiers are stronger and faster. They are controlled by an advanced computer program called S.E.T.H. When the government wants to shutdown the program, S.E.T.H. takes control of building and the soldiers. Luc Devereaux is the only one that can shut down the program, but S.E.T.H. is one step ahead of Luc, as the UniSol Romeo (played by Bill Goldberg) kidnaps Luc's 13-year-old daughter Hillary.The Universal Solider franchise is hard to follow as The Return ignores the two previous made-for-TV sequels and The Return is ignored by the two newest sequels, Regeneration and Day of Reckoning. The Return's plot is really thin. I'm not for sure why the producers wanted to change the tone and ignore a few facts from the first movie. The acting and dialogue is B-movie quality, but the movie does have some great action scenes, starting with the boat chase in the opening and ending with Van Dame fighting Goldberg. In the end, the movie isn't great, but the action is fun to watch.

Felicia has a secret. She just escaped from a mental hospital, where Dr. Shanks was testing her telekinesis. He was forcing her to use her powers. Then, something horrible went wrong. Felicia couldn't control powers and she accidentally killed.She is now on the run, hitchhiking her way to safety. She ends up in Shadyside, where she volunteers to housesit. No one knows who she is.Felicia starts to make friends and possibly a new life, but then out of nowhere, she gets the note. Someone knows who she is.I flew right through this book. Nothing really exciting happens. There have been many stories about telekinesis, so the plot was nothing new. At times, it seems R.L. Stine rushed through the story. Read at your own risk.

I've been a lifetime Garfield fan and I was excited to see Garfield: The Movie when it was originally released. The best casting was Bill Murray as Garfield, but Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt were wrong as Jon and Liz. David Schwimmer would have been my pick for Jon! Garfield himself looks fine computer animated. Why didn't the producers have the other animals animated, especially Odie? I would have liked the movie better if the characters actually looked like the comic strip's characters!Garfield is not a bad movie for kids, but it is forgettable.

While teaching at the Bible Adventure Training Academy, the Bibleman's (a human transformed by the word of God) secret weapon, the armor is God is stolen by the treacherous villains. Bibleman and his Bible Team must stop the villains from using the weapon against them.I honestly never knew anything about Bibleman when I received this DVD to review. Not counting the bonus features, the LIVE episode is under forty minutes, and was somewhat painful for me to watch. It's obvious that this shows is aimed for a younger audience. The acting is horrible, the costumes are silly, and the special effects are even worse. It reminds me of the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," but with a Christian twist to it. Bibleman is like a superhero with a light saber. There are a few fight scenes to keep a kid's interests. Despite the moral messages, the story is still the basic good vs. evil storyline, but with bad production values.

Unlike the previous films in the series, Howling IV: The Original Nightmare was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in 1988, originally released by Warner Bros., but Echo Bridge Home Entertainment now owns the rights to it.I've only seen a handful of the Howling movies out of the eight movies that have been made so far, the last one,The Howling Reborn, came out last year. I recall seeing this movie advertise on a local channel in the early 90s and of course my mom let me watch it probably just so I would stop pestering her about it. The movie had commercials, so naturally it would be edited for broadcast television. For the actually movie, I only remember bits and pieces of it until I finally bought the DVD a few months ago for only five dollars.For anyone who has actually readGary Brandner's The Howlingnovel, you'll know that the first movie barely went by it, but Howling IV: The Original Nightmare is the only movie that almost completely goes by the book except that the names have been changed and there is no rapist in it. The film was made for fewer than two-million dollars. It won the 1988 Golden Chainsaw award for Best Direct-to-Video Feature from Fangoria, but it received mostly negative reviews from fans due to the small amount of time the werewolves appeared.The movie opens up with author Marie Adams (played by Romy Windsor) meeting up with her agent, but right there and then she has strange visions about a nun and a werewolf. She screams like a madwoman and ends up in the hospital. The doctors recommend to her husband Richard (played by Michael T. Weiss) that she should take a break from her writing and get away from the city.Soon enough, Richard and Marie are leaving Los Angeles and they go to a small town called Drago, where they rent a small cabin. On the very first night, Marie hears a peculiar wolf's howl coming from the woods.They go into town the next day and explore and antique shop owned by the strange Eleanor (played by Lamya Derval), whom happens to take a liking to Richard. Later when they return to the cabin, Marie goes for a walk with her small dog. The dog gets loose and runs further into the woods. She later finds what looks like the remains of her dog, but when Richard goes to find it, he only finds a toy.Marie visits, Mrs. Ormstead, a neighbor and the owner of a local store, and she informs Marie that the previous couple who stayed in their cabin had mysteriously disappeared. While walking back to the cabin, Marie once again has visions of a nun and for a brief moment she thought the nun was before her, but it turned out to be only Eleanor in a cape. When she finally returns to the cabin, she has more strange visions this time of a man and a woman, possibly the previous couple who stayed in the cabin. She tries to tell Richard, but he doesn't believe and storms out to spend time with his new "friend" Eleanor.A woman, Janice Hatch, shows up at the cabin claiming to be a fan of Marie's writings, but she turns out to be an ex-nun searching for her friend, Sister Ruth, who disappeared the previous year, but later returned talking about the devil and hearing the howls of wolves. Ruth later died for unknown reasons and Janice has come to find out what happened to her. The two women work together to uncover the startling truth about Drago's residents.The majority of low-budget horror movies, especially the ones that go direct-to-video or now of days go straight to the DVD five-dollar-bin, have bad acting, but in the Howling IV the acting is decent. I'm aware that some of the die hard Howling fans don't care for the lack of werewolves, but it didn't bother me one bit. I like the Gothic atmosphere throughout the movie. Yes, there a few slow moments, but it helps build up the mystery of what is going on with the town of Drago, even though we all know that there has to be some kind of werewolf involved. There is not a lot of violence in the movie compared to today's horror flicks. If it wasn't for the brief nudity and language, the movie could easily pass as PG-13! Howling IV is not the greatest werewolf move, but it is one of the better Howling sequels.

During the 1930s and 1940s struggling writers would make some extra cash by writing fiction for the many pulp magazines that were on the market at the time. Pulp magazines didn't have to rely on fancy glossy paper with expensive artwork or the superior production values. What they did rely on was the well plotted stories from real storytellers with crazy villains, plot twists at every corner, and adventures set in faraway lands. The authors didn't get paid much, mostly a penny per word, so many of them wrote like crazy and had their stories appearing frequently. Some of the most popular pulp writers of the time were L.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Raymond Chandler, Ray Bradbury and L. Ron Hubbard.Galaxy Press has been releasing the short stories written by L. Ron Hubbard to paperbacks and audiobooks under the Stories from the Golden Age, in which they nicely sent me a free audiobook in exchange for an honest review.Cargo of Coffins first appeared in the November 1937 issue of Argosy Weekly and is set on the high seas. The story centers on two bitter rivals Paco Corvino and Lars Marlin, and by chance, they both end up on the same luxury yacht. Paco is the smooth-talking, con man that sent Lars to a penal colony in the French Guiana. Lars escaped prison and wants revenge, but now a twist of fate has lead him to Paco.Another twist of fate leaves Lars as the Captain of the yacht where Paco is working as a steward. Paco over hears a group of passengers that want to meet someone that is royalty. Paco fakes his death and leaves a letter informing the crew that he is actually royalty, but it is just one of his cons as he eventually shows up alive. Now everyone is treating him as if he was royalty. Meanwhile, Lars cannot do anything about the situation because Paco is blackmailing him to make a stop at the penal colony island to retrieve some coffins. Paco has a devilish plan in store for the passengers and crew, but Lars has plans on stopping him once and for all.Cargo of Coffins is a fast-paced intriguing tale of revenge. It's the best plotted story from L. Ron Hubbard that I have listened to so far. The voice cast and sound effects are top notch! I actually felt like I was right there on the yacht with bullets flying at me. If you are looking for an adventure tale, I recommend Cargo of Coffins.

What happens when you blend in the scripts fromArmageddon,2012,TwisterandVolcano? You get the direct-to-DVD Super Cyclone.I've never cared much for disaster movies, even though it seems like there is a new one on the SyFy Channel every other week. To me they are basically all the same. A natural occurrence happens destroying cities and our government tries to stop it with some unbelievable plan. I have reviewed a few other Asylum titles this year and they kindly sent me a free invite to stream this movie online in exchange for an honest review.Yes, I know that the DVD cover looks like fun, but the movie is a complete mess from start to finish. The plot is simple; a group of oil drillers off the shore of south California accidentally drills to close to the Earth's core causing a volcano eruption. Since the eruption occurred at the bottom of the ocean, it creates one super cyclone that is going to destroy most of California. The only hope is a group of oil drillers (who do absolutely nothing but run around the oil rig), Dr. Jenna Sparks (played by Ming-Na), and Travis Verdon (played by Nicholas Turturro). Of course there is our US Navy, which is horribly portrayed throughout the movie.One would think if Dr. Jenna Sparks could pilot a helicopter off of an oil rig in hurricane type weather, then the trained Navy pilots would have no trouble saving the men on the oil rigs.The movie is fast-paced with some of the worst CGI special effects that I have ever seen. The volcano erupting underneath the ocean floor would cause a tsunami before it would a cyclone or hurricane. I tried to ignore the basic plot and just watch the movie for its B-quality. Ming-Na and Nicholas Turturro are the only two decent actors, but they can't help save this disaster of a movie.

After the success of the ABC's daytime soap Dark Shadows, the creator Dan Curtis directed a darker version from the script written by Sam Hall and Gordon Russell and produced by MGM back in 1970. The script was based on the popular Barnabas storyline and starred the original cast such as Jonathan Frid, Grayson Hall, Kathryn Leigh Scott, David Henesy, and Roger Davis. The movie was shot in six weeks with a budget of $750,000, which is now considered a low-budget.The movie uses an altered version of the Barnabas plot. The recently fired handyman Willie Loomis visit's the Collins' family Old House in an attempt to steal rare jewels, but instead he unleashes the vampire cursed Barnabas from his 150-year confinement. Using his vampire powers, Barnabas makes Willie his slave. Barnabas wastes no time and introduces his self to the Collins family as a cousin to England.Barnabas meets the young governess, Maggie Evans, who looks exactly like his lost-love Josette. While during this time, Barnabas turns Carolyn, whom is later staked by Professor T. Eliot Stokes.The family doctor, Julia Hoffman, examines the blood of the victims and, for some unknown reason, knows that vampirism is behind the deaths. She soon realizes that Barnabas is a vampire and she offers to cure him. Barnabas accepts the offer. For a short time he is cured and begins to romance Maggie Evans.Julia falls for Barnabas and becomes jealous of Maggie, resulting in Barnabas being given an overdose of the cure, which shows his true age to Maggie. With his true identity exposed, Barnabas must kill the entire Collins family and anyone else that becomes between Maggie and him.House of Dark Shadows is an edgier, bloodier version of the campy daytime soap, and, in my opinion, one of the creepiest vampire movies every made. The sets have a more gothic vibe than the series did. Sadly, the movie has never been released on DVD, but rumor has it that it'll be released by Warner Bros. later in 2012. For those of you that can't wait, there is an older version on VHS which you can sometimes find on Ebay or Amazon.com for sale. Occasionally, TCM and Chiller air House of Dark Shadows, along with the sequel Night of Dark Shadows.

Sam Reide has the ability to travel back to any time or location within his own lifetime. His sheltered sister, Jenna, monitors him while he lies in a bathtub full of icy water. He first went back in time to save his sister from a fire when, but he ended up changing the timeline as his parents die in the fire.Sam's girlfriend, Rebecca, was murdered a few years before and her sister, Elizabeth, believes that the killer is still out there, which means Rebecca's murderer, that is behind bars and is going to be executed within days, is innocent.Sam goes back in time to the night of Rebecca's murder, just to see who the killer is, but then he tries to stop her death, only resulting in her being murdered in a different manor. When he returns back to the present, things have changed and he is now a murder suspect in not just Rebecca's death, but in a string of murders. Each time he goes back to find the murderer he changes his current timeline, and one by one his most trusted allies are being murdered.I have never seen the previous films in the series and after a quick google search, I was surprised to learn that each movie has a different main character and plot. I only watched The Butterfly Effect 3 because it came in a two disc set with seven other After Dark Horrorfest III films. The movie started out a little confusing for me with all the flashbacks, but once I figured out what was going on I was glued to screen. There is a lot of blood/gore throughout the movie, not to mention the graphic sex scene, but deep down there is an intriguing plot that keeps you guessing who the killer really is. Honestly, I didn't have a clue who the killer was until he or she pulled off the mask, which reminds of Jason's feed sack fromFriday the 13th, Part 2 (Deluxe Edition). For a low-budget horror film, the plot was never predictable and the majority of the acting was decent. Now, I'm interested in watching the first two movies.

The Broken starts off with Gina McVey having dinner with her family, friends and her boyfriend, Stefan. Suddenly, and without a reason, a mirror in the room falls and crashes to the floor. While she is heading to work the next day, she could have sworn that she saw herself driving a car. She follows the woman and sneaks into her house only to find a photo of Gina and her father. Not knowing what is going on, she hops into her car and gets into a car accident.Gina wakes up in the hospital with no memory of what has happened to her. While she is recovering she stays with her boyfriend, but he is acting strange as if he was a completely different person. She soon realizes that doppelgangers had escaped from the broken mirror and is no replacing her family members and friends.I like Lena Headey onGame of Thronesso I was eager to watch The Broken when I found it in the Wal-mart $5 bin in a set of eight movies. Though the pacing was slow, I was hooked from the very beginning of it as I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on. For a low-budget horror movie, it has great acting, an interesting plot and a great director at the helm. There are some plot holes here and there, but nothing that really bothered me. Besides from the slowness and the predictable ending, I surprisingly enjoyed The Broken.

Slaughter was released to theaters back in 2009 as part of the After Dark Horrorfest III (aka 8 Films to Die For). As of writing this review, it is only the second After Dark movie I have viewed.The film opens up with a twenty-something Faith (played Amy Shiels) arriving in Atlanta and leaving her small town life, her horrible mother, and her abusive ex-boyfriend. At a nightclub, she meets a twenty-something Lola (played by Lucy Holt), who is care-free type person. They chat and exchange numbers.Just as Faith starts to adjust to the city life, she receives dozens of hateful emails from her ex-boyfriend. Not having anyone to turn to, she befriends Lola, who lives outside of Atlanta on her family farm with her father and brothers. Faith moves out of the city after she recognizes her ex's truck parked near her apartment and she ends up living with Lola in the upstairs part of the barn that has been turned into an apartment.Lola lives a wild life; letting rich older men buy her stuff in exchange for a one night stand. The men are always gone by the time Faith gets up in the morning, but then she notices strange things. One of the men left his watch behind and Faith finds a set of car keys in the weeds.Faith finds it odd that Lola doesn't talk to her father, who spends most of his time near the hogs' slaughterhouse. She starts to wonder if these men Lola has been dating are really leaving in the mornings or is something else happening to them.One day while nobody is looking, Faith slips into the slaughterhouse and unlocks the backroom. What she finds might just end her life?I had absolutely no expectations when I started watching this movie, in which I had never heard of before. A lot of low-budget horror movies have horrible camera work, but not here as every scene is top-notch! After the movie ended, I googled for reviews about it and I was shocked to learn that many people didn't understand the movie. Especially, the part about the teeth being removed.Spoiler Alert: Someone in the movie pulls someone's teeth out and then pulls their own teeth out, that way when the authorities find the disfigured body they will think it belonged to the killer as they can only confirm the identity of the body with the teeth!I also read a few reviews that thought the movie was so boring! What was boring? I'm sick and tired of horror movies or what some people call torture porn, like the Hostel movies, that rely on graphic violence every five minutes as it leaves no room for the viewer's imagination.The movie's plot is about abusive women and how they react to the aftermath of it. Faith tries to move on with her life by moving to the city, where as Lola...whoops, I said too much.Yes, most modern horror films are predictable and, unfortunately, Slaughter has a few predictable spots, but then again it doesn't. I thought I had figured out what exactly was going on (akaThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)), especially when the father keeps going into the slaughterhouse and Lola's lovers keep going missing, but then there are several twists and turns that changes everything and builds up the suspense until the not-so happily ever after ending.Slaughter isn't a perfect film, but it is an underrated horror yarn with decent acting, decent writing, and great directing. With Halloween around the corner, I would recommend others to rent or buy (I bought it for five dollars at Walmart in an eight movie set.) the movie, turn off the lights and enter into the slaughterhouse.

Everyday after school, I believe it was 4:30, I would watch the Tiny Toon Adventures that aired from 1990-1992 (original series episodes), and continued to air in reruns for several years. In March 1992, Warner Home video released the direct-to-video Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, which some critics considered it to be odd because it was the first animated movie in the United States to be released straight to VHS and Laserdisc. The movie was a smash success selling over one million copies. The movie later aired as a four-part episode on Fox Kids.In the movie, the Acme Looniversity school year is over and Buster & Babs Bunny (no relation) and the gang are excited to start their summer vacation. Buster and Babs start out by having a water gun fight, but then things turn ugly when they accidentally flood Acme Acres. They end up floating down the river, leading them down south to a riverboat, where they barely escape with their fur.Meanwhile, Plucky Duck goes along with Hamton J. Pig and his parents across the country to the amusement park HappyWorldLand. Plucky must fight off a crazed hitchhiker, but what may kill him is putting up with the annoying Pigs, which all leads to a hilarious outcome at HappyWorldLand.Furball, the cat, finally escapes the deadly clutches of Elmyra Duff, so Elmyra goes to a zoo and tortures the animals (she doesn't mean to harm anyone, she just plays too rough with them). Fifi Le Fume, the skunk, gets a date with the famous actor Johnny Pew, who doesn't want anything to do with her. Their date turns into a disaster leading them into the hands of Elmyra.Once the series' original run ended, I moved on to other things, therefore I never got to see How I Spent My Vacation until it was released to DVD. I laughed all the way through the movie at the characters' slapstick humor and their clever puns to pop culture. I would give the movie a five-star review, but just like other reviewers have mentioned, the DVD quality is not the best, similar toTiny Toon Adventures - Season 1, Vol. 1andTiny Toon Adventures: Season 1, Vol. 2. I have never seen the VHS version, so I'm not going to compare the DVD to it. I'm glad Warner Home Video brought the movie out, but I'm hoping that they will soon release seasons 2 & 3 as well as the television specials, It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas, The Tiny Toon Spring Break Special, and Tiny Toons' Night Ghoulery.

I guess some people doesn't understand that Goosebumps One Day at Horrorland is not a movie! It has four episodes from the 90s TV Series that is based on the books by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget! Some of the adaptions got an hour episode, a two-part episode, or a single episode. Because of the short running time, the majority of the plot had to be cut.Here we get the two-part episode titled One Day At Horrorland. While on their way to the Zoo Gardens, the Morris family decides to stop at the Horrorland amusement park. At first the place seems like fun, but then the horror begins.Welcome to Camp Nightmare is another two-part episode, where Billy is sent to a crappy summer camp, but then the campers start to disappear. Determined not to be next vanishing camper, Billy tries to find out what is going on.Like I said, these episodes have a low-budget, which explains the bad special effects and acting. Goosebumps is a clean-cut way to introduce scary tales to your kids and the DVD can be fun to watch around Halloween.

I've enjoyed doing Tae Bo for about two years now and I was excited to buy the PT 24/7 from an eBay store seller last year, which I paid around $55 for it new. It came in a nice packaging box and in it was the two gloves, bands, velcro foot straps, a workout calendar, a diet guide book, and the 7 30 minute DVD workouts.The workouts are:BasicsCardioCombo SculptRipped CoreBoot Camp PowerBody BlastCardio BurnThe gloves are bulky and the first time I used them, the thumb holes cut into my hands. During the second week the gloves started to peel off in places, followed by the stitching breaking apart. The gloves are cheap made. Instead of sending them back I use the gloves from the Gold's Gym MMA Training Kit, which fit a lot better, giving me more movement in my hands for punching.I noticed there are a few complaints about the velcro feet straps. I have had them about ten months and I have never had a problem, except for that they can stick to the carpet.The Basic workout is to help you learn the moves and to get use to the bands. My favorite workouts are Combo Sculpt, Ripped Core, Boot Camp Power, and Body Blast.If you use the bands correctly they give you the resistance you need to see changes in your body. I especially feel the difference in my shoulders and arms. I'm only 5'9 and the bands work perfectly for me. Someone who is shorter or taller may have problems with them.I noticed some reviewers complain about the price. A single Tae Bo DVD can cost around ten dollars at Walmart or up to fifteen dollars on Amazon.com. In PT 24/7 you are getting 7 workouts, so if you bought them separately it would cost you at least seventy dollars, and that is without the gloves, bands, and the workout schedule.Tae Bo may not be for everyone, but it works for me.

Last week I happened to catch the movie Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour on an Encore channel. I very seldom watch a movie during the day, let alone turn on the television, but after reading the title on the menu guide, I thought I would give the movie a try.The Paranormal Hour begins with a seventeen-year-old Sarah Landon (played by Rissa Walters) returning to Pine Valley, California to visit her grandmother, Thelma Shaw. Before she arrives at her grandma's, she has car problems and stops by a local repair shop where she hears part of a disturbing story. She doesn't get the full story until she asks her grandma about it, who was more than glad to tell the tale.A young man, David Baker, is cursed! On his 21st birthday, which is only a few days away, he will be killed by his dead uncle, Ben Woods. Years ago, Ben's son, on his 21st birthday, was killed in a car accident that David's mother caused. David was known as a good kid and was getting ready to go to college, but then he learned of the curse and cut himself off from the world. He has become obsessed with the paranormal, and is trying to find away to stop his uncle.As his 21st birthday nears, his bother, Matt, and his new friend Sarah Landon try to prevent his death.Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour was released in limited theaters back in 2007 running only at 81 minutes, and was a complete flop at the box-office. I never remembered the movie ever being released in theaters, let alone every seeing it advertised. The ghost curse plot seems to be interesting, but the movie is ruined with bad actors with horrible dialogue, bad camera shots, and not enough action for a paranormal story. Rissa Walters who played Sarah Landon gave the only decent performance, but she is held back by the untalented co-stars. I felt like I was watching a bad TV-Movie rather than a theatrical release. I wonder if they used a first draft script instead of a final one. I sat there for 80 minutes, as I had to find out how it ended, only for the movie to end in somewhat of a cliffhanger, in which the producers were hopping to make Sarah Landon into a film franchise.I would only recommend the movie to families, as there is no bad language and nudity. There is some mild PG violence in it. It could be a good way to introduce a clean-cut haunting movie to your kids. Overall, I liked the premise, but I will never watch it again.

It's been over fifteen years since R.L. Stine first introduced his readers to the evil ventriloquist's dummy. Slappy is back in this re-release of the first book. It has brand new cover and extra bonus features that include: Q& A with R.L. Stine, Fright Gallery: Slappy the Dummy, A Dummy's Guide to Ventriloquism and Slappy's Greatest Wisecracks.Kris and Lindy Powell are twins that share everything. Lindy finds a ventriloquist's dummy in a dumpster near their house. She takes it home and plans on making money with it by performing at birthday parties. Her sister doesn't like Slappy because he's always starring at her with an evil grin.Thinking that she is jealous of Lindy's dummy, her father buys her a dummy at a second hand store. Kris loves the dummy and names him Mr. Woods. She finds a piece of paper in the dummy's pocket and reads the strange words out loud: "Karru marri odonna loma molonu karrano."After a few strange events, Kris believes that Mr. Woods is alive and no one believes her. How will she defeat Mr. Woods?It was fun reading about Slappy again. He's one of my favorite Goosebumps characters and I think you will enjoy reading about him too.

Fortress 2: Re-entry is set ten years after the events of the first film, where John Brennick (played once again by Christopher Lambert) is living in North America with is new wife and son, but his happiness is about to be ruined. Three strangers appear asking him to them destroy Men-Tel's new power station. He declines their offer, but within moments Men-Tel helicopters appear. Jon lets himself be captured so his wife and son can escape. This time John is put into a space prison a satellite orbiting the Earth, in which it is the inmates' job to repair it.I've never seen the first movie, which I heard was good, so I had low expectations when I started to watch the sequel. Yes, the dialogue is predictable and the plot is clich&eacute;d, but considering it was a direct-to-video it has decent special effects and acting in it. It's not the greatest science fiction movie ever made, but I had fun watching it.

I bought this Triple Feature 3-DVD Set containing Breaker! Breaker!, Hero and the Terror and Lone Wolf McQuade at Walmart for under five dollars at a Black Friday sale. Its been several years since I had seen any of Chuck Norris's movies, so I was excited about my purchase.There is an error on the DVD cover jacket and the Breaker! Breaker! disc as it has the running time as 65 minutes when it is actually 95 minutes! Both Breaker! Breaker! and Hero and the Terror are on double-sided discs, one side being full screen and the other being widescreen. Lone Wolf is on a single disc.Overall, I enjoyed re-watching the three films.

I have several Tae Bo workouts and Tae Bo Express is one of the better ones. There are 8 different 10-minute workouts. Just because it is only ten minutes doesn't mean the workouts are easy. I was sweating before a full ten minutes was up. The only downside to the DVD is that there is no "play all" button and the workouts are listed out of order.The correct order should be:1. Fast Footwork2. Punch & Kick3. Power Punch4. Kick Express5. Boot Camp Power6. Combo Express7. Tae Bo Abs8. Isolation Toning

Boy Eats Girl is an Irish/UK Production that was filmed in 2005, but it wasn't released to DVD until 2007! The movie is about a teen named Nathan who is brought back from the dead by his mother through a voodoo ritual after he died of an accidental suicide. There is one side effect from the ritual, Nathan now craves human flesh. During a fight with a classmate, Nathan bites the other kid, causing a zombie chain reaction.I bought Boy Eats Girl in a movie six pack DVD at my local Walmart for only five dollars. I wasn't expecting much from the movie. It starts out a little slow for the first twenty minutes, and then I was hooked on it. It is a combination ofShaun of the DeadandMy Boyfriend's Back.

In the fifth chapter in the series, Darren must pass five dangerous trials to prove himself to the Vampire Princes and Vampire Generals or face death by the stakes in the Hall of Death.Darren passes the first three trials, but not the fourth. Harkat interfered and saved Darren from a wild boar. This broke the Vampire Clan's rules. The Vampire Princes and Generals began to discuss where or not Darren should continued or be put to death.Trials of Death is more fast-paced than the previous book and ends in a great cliffhanger.

The three-part Chillogy are my favorite episodes from the Goosebumps series, which are not based on any of the books or stories by R.L. Stine, but was based on an original concept.It stars a young Caterina Scorsone as Jessica, a girl who loves to save her money, and to invest in a "Sure Thing", even if it means ripping off Matthew and Todd at their garage sale, or not loaning her brother money to buy their parents an anniversary present.While searching the attic, she stumbles upon a realistic miniature town. Suddenly, Jessica is zapped into the town, where a strange character named Karl makes her an offer to make a lot of money. Let's just say things go wrong and she ends up dumping the town near the garbage cans.Matthew and his younger brother come by and pick up the town. They take it home and set it up in their bedroom. After losing his baseball game, Matthew gets zapped into a town where he plays a deadly game of baseball. He barely escapes!Then, Karl lures young Todd into the town. Matthew and Jessica must return to the miniature town to save Todd.

This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.Here we get two episodes, The House of No Return and The Haunted House Game. In The House of No Return, Chris is new to town and is desperately wanting to make new friends, even if it means going into a haunted house.Then in The Haunted House Game, a few kids discover a strange board game in a creepy old house. Once they start playing, they unleash several ghosts.Both of these episodes are about 22 minutes in length. Kids will enjoy watching them around Halloween.

The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.Strange things are happening on Hannah's street in The Ghost Next Door, when a new boy magically moves into the house next door that has been abandoned for some time. The pale boy keeps disappearing and there is a dark shadow following her.The Ghost Next Door is a freaky Goosebumps tale that kids will like watching around Halloween.

I wasn't aware that the last half of the season had even aired due to the Cartoon Network not promoting the move to Saturday mornings, where it should have been placed in the first place. I just happened to stumble upon "The Birth of the Blades" one Saturday morning.I grew watching the original series, which can never be replaced, but the new ThunderCats has surpassed all my expectations for a remake. It has great writing, a talented voice-cast, and colorful animation. Unlike the original that mostly focused on Lion-O, the new incarnation has allowed episodes to focus on the other characters, giving them more depth.I enjoyed watching this two discs set. My favorite episodes from Book three would have to be the two-part finale "What Lies Above." Unfortunately, the season ended in a cliffhanger and the Cartoon Network didn't order a second season. The only hope for a second season lies in the powers of Warner Bros., who own the series.The episodes on Book 3 are:Disc One:Ep. 17 - Native SonEp. 18 - Survival of the FittestEp. 19 - The PitEp. 20 - Curse of RatillaEp. 21 - Birth of the BladesDisc Two:Ep. 22 - The Forever BagEp. 23 - Recipe for DisasterEp. 24 - The Soul SeverEp. 25 - What Lies Above (Part One)Ep. 26 - What Lies Above (Part Two)

Disney Channel has had a hard time adapting their pre-teen series into movies, but The Lizzie McGuire Movie was an exception, despite the fact that the character Miranda was written off.Lizzie and her best-friend Gordo along with Ethan, Kate, and their other classmates go on a school trip to Italy! Lizzie is mistaken for Italy's biggest singer, Isabella, and Lizzie falls for Isabella's singing partner, Paolo. When Isabella goes missing before an upcoming event, Lizzie must learn how to lip-sing and act like Lizzie. Meanwhile, Lizzie's little brother, Matt, knows the truth about Lizzie. He convinces his parents that he misses his sister and that they should go visit her.The movie is not perfect, but it is a clean-cut family film.

I originally saw Halloween 4 when I rented it and the fifth movie a few weeks beforeHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myerscame out to VHS. I only had basic cable as a kid, and Halloween 4 & 5 never aired on any of the channels. The first thing I noticed was the horrible cheap looking mask. You would think Moustapha Akkad would want a decent looking mask, but I guess they ran out of money for it. All the VHS covers and DVD covers have Michael wearing the 1978 mask, so it can be a little misleading.After the box-office bomb calledHalloween III: Season of the Witch, the franchise took a six year break, coming back in 1988 with Michael Myers surviving the explosion at the end ofHalloween II. For the past ten years, he has been in a coma at a sanitarium. Without Dr. Loomis's approval, Michael is being transferred to another hospital by an ambulance. He awakes from the coma and kills the paramedics.Dr. Loomis arrives at the crime scene on Halloween morning. After a quick glance he knew that Michael is alive. On his way to Haddonfield, Illinois, he stops by a gas station/diner where he finds two corpses and Michael, now dressed in a mechanic's clothes. Dr. Loomis pulls out his gun, but it is too late as Michael has escaped in a tow-truck, causing a fire that explodes Loomis's car and the gas station/diner.Eight-year-old Jamie Lloyd is still grieving over the death of her parents, whom died in a car accident. She continues to live in Haddonfield with her foster family, the Carruthers. On Halloween night, Jamie's foster parents are spending the night out and Jamie's foster-sister Rachel is going to take her (dressed in a clown costume) trick-or-treating for the night, even though Rachel is going to miss her date with her boyfriend. The girls are unaware that they are being watched by the bogeyman!After getting a ride from a stranger, Dr. Looms enlists the help of Sheriff Meeker and his deputies. They locate Rachel and Jamie and barricade them inside the sheriff's house, where Rachel's boyfriend, Brady, happens to be with the sheriff's daughter. Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Meeker leave the house to search the streets for Michael unaware that he is already in the house. One by one, Michael kills everyone in his path until it is just Rachel and Jamie defending for their lives.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is one my favorite sequels from the franchise. Yes, the acting isn't great and the mask is horrible, but I'm a sucker for any movie that is set on Halloween. I didn't mind that Jamie Lee Curtis didn't appear in the film, but instead the film focuses on Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris) who becomes Michael's obsession and only bloodline. Once again, Donald Pleasence reprises his role as Dr. Samuel Loomis, but the character is older and a little crazier as he is determined to stop Michael's madness. Even thought I have seen the movie dozens of times, I still love the twist at the ending.I bought the VHS tape in the late 90s and replaced it back in 2006 with this DVD. There are many extras - Audio Commentary with actresses Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris, Audio Commentary with Writer Alan B. McElory, Halloween 4/5 Discussion Panel, The Making of Halloween 4 and the theatrical trailer.

Taking place five years after the dreadfulDracula II: Ascension, Luke (played by Jason London) and Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee) find the whereabouts of Dracula (played by Rutger Hauer). The vampire has returned to his castle in Carpathian Mountains and has brought Elizabeth (played by Diane Neal), Luke's girlfriend, with him.Luke and Father Uffizi travel to Romania, where the people there are in a Civil War, so the cities look like a war zone. They find a reporter and her cameraman that had barely survived a helicopter explosion. They must battle local rebels and vampires to find their way to Dracula's castle, where Luke finds out that Elizabeth is now a creature of the night.I always thoughtDracula 2000was a lame vampire movie, the direct-to-video sequel was even worse because the writers changed the events from the first movie. Dracula II: Ascension &Wes Craven Presents: Dracula III: Legacywere shot back-to-back, but after the Dracula II rentals bombed, the third movie was shelved for almost two years. Dracula III may be an average vampire flick, but it is the best out of the trilogy. The weak plot is enhanced by a dark and moody atmosphere with several vampire bloody scenes and nudity thrown in. Dracula III: Legacy is not a great horror, but it should entertain most vampire fans.

Garfield & Friends is one of my favorite Saturday Morning cartoons from my childhood. Half of the things that Garfield says can't be said today on TV! I bought the DVD set back in 2004 on the day that it came out, and I've enjoyed it ever since. "Heatwave Holiday" is my favorite from this set, where Jon, Garfield, and Odie decorate the house for Christmas in July, so they could think it was 'cool' when it was actually hot outside. The whole town picks up on it and there is Christmas decorations everywhere.The episodes on this DVD set are:Disc 1:Episode 1: Peace & Quiet; U.S. Acres: Wanted Wade; Garfield Goes HawaiianEpisode 2: Box O' Fun; U.S. Acres: Unidentified Flying Orson; School DazeEpisode 3: Nightly Nightmare; U.S. Acres: Banana Nose; Ode to OdieEpisode 4: Fraidy Cat; U.S. Acres: Shell Shocked Sheldon; Nothing to Sneeze AboutEpisode 5: Garfield's Moving Experience; U.S. Acres: Wade: You're Scared; Good MousekeepingEpisode 6: Identity Crises; U.S. Acres: The Bad Sport; Up a TreeEpisode 7: Weighty Problem; U.S. Acres:The Worm Turns; Good Cat, Bad CatEpisode 8: Cabin Fever; U.S. Acres: Return of Power Pig; Fair ExchangeDisc 2:Episode 9: The Binky Show; U.S. Acres: Keeping Cool; Don't Move!Episode 10: Magic Mutt; U.S. Acres: Short Story; Monday MiseryEpisode 11: Best of Breed; U.S. Acres: National Tapioca Pudding Day; All About OdieEpisode 12: Caped Avenger; U.S. Acres: Shy Fly Guy; Green Thumbs DownEpisode 13: Forget Me Not; U.S. Acres: I Like Having You Around!Episode 14: Pest of a Guest; U.S. Acres: The Impractical Joker; Fat & FurryEpisode 15: Rip Van Kitty; U.S. Acres: Grabbity; The Big CatnapEpisode 16: The Great Getaway; U.S. Acres: Scrambled Eggs; Hansel and GarfieldDisc 3:Episode 17: The Sludge Monster; U.S. Acres: Fortune Kooky; Heatwave HolidayEpisode 18: One Good Fern Deserves Another; U.S. Acres: Goody-Go-Round; The Black BookEpisode 19: The Legend of the Lake; U.S. Acres: Double Oh Orson; Health FeudEpisode 20: Binky Gets Cancelled!; U.S. Acres: Show Stoppers; Cutie and the BeastEpisode 21: The Lasagna Zone; U.S. Acres: Sleepytime Pig; YojumboEpisode 22: Pros and Cons; U.S. Acres: Rooster Revenge; Lights!

Heathcliff is based on the comic strip by the late George Gately. Prior to the 1984, Heathcliff appeared in the 1980 series Heathcliff and the Dingbats, which last two years and 25 episodes. When Heathcliff returned to TV in 1984, it followed a similar format with each episode having two 11 segments, followed by a short ending segment with Heathcliff giving good pet advise to kids. The old Dingbats segment was replaced with The Catillac Cats, which was created by Jean Chalopin, Bruno Bianchi.Just like the 1981 incarnation, the legendary Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and many other Looney Tunes characters.) provided the voice for Heathcliff. The show follows Heathcliff, who is an indoor/outdoor streetcat, spending his days romancing Sonja, a white Persian cat, the rest of the day he is causing trouble, like getting into fights with other cats, annoying dogs, and conning everyone he meets. The Catillac Cats centers on Rift-Raft, Hector, Mungo, and Wordsworth. When he is not romancing his girlfriend, Cleo, Rift-Raft and his gang are always getting into some sort of trouble. Occasionally, when Rift-Raft is not around his gang assists Heathcliff.I flew through Heathcliff: King of the Beasts, which is still funny and is better than most of today's cartoons. I had forgot about The Catillac Cats, but after a few episodes and I started to remember them. There is one mistake on the back cover of the DVD. It has the bonus episode from The Busy World of Richard Scarry, which is not on the DVD at all. Instead, it is an episode of The Get-Along Gang. Overall, I really enjoyed revisiting Heathcliff and this 10 episode DVD is a great way to introduce the fat orange cat to a new generation.

Jenny Jordan, the daughter of Colonel Jeffrey Jordan, takes a job as a sectary for the Senate Military Committee that was offered by the newly elected Abraham Lincoln, just as the Civil War begins. Soon she meets Corporal Francis "Buck" Brownell, who is part of the Zouave from New York. The Union soldier begins courting Jenny, which is somewhat of a problem because she is original from the southern state of Virginia.Before long, she finds out that her father is a spy for the Confederate, and he asks his daughter to help him take a message to the Confederate. Jenny loves her country and Buck, but she is devoted to her father and her home state of Virginia. She must become a Confederate spy, but she hopes she can still have a future with Buck.I received "Beloved Enemy" from the publisher in exchange for this review. At the time the book was published this was the 5oth western novel published by Al Lacy! His experience and love for the genre is shown in the details he used depicting the start of the Civil War. Even thought Jenny and Buck are the main characters, Abraham Lincoln and his family have great deal to do in this third novel in the Battles of Destiny series. I especially liked the opening chapter, which showed Colonel Elmer Ellsworth and his Pinkerton men escorting the President-elect Lincoln and his family from Springfield, Illinois to Washington D.C. by train. I didn't realize how dangerous it was for Lincoln when he was elected.The author must have done a great deal of research to get all the historical details correct for the battle scenes, in which "Beloved Enemy" chronicles the first battle of Bull Run. The book is combination ofNorth and South (North and South Trilogy Part One)andThe Killer Angels, two other great books that I recommend. Overall, "Beloved Enemy" is incredible read for Civil War and western buffs.

This is the tenth and longest book in the series. After the murder of, Mr. Crepsley, Darren and Harket return to the Cirque Du Freak. Darren sends Debbie and Alice Burgess to Vampire Mountain where they can be safe from Steve and his army of Vampanese.Mr. Tiny tells Darren it is time for him to help Harket find out who he is. They journey to a barren waste world to discover Harket's previous identity.This book could be written in less than fifty pages but instead is dragged out to two hundred and 265. I found it hard to get through. There are a few twists and turns to keep you interested, but I do not recommend this book. It is the worse in the series.

The Harvest was released in 1992 and is about a screenwriter Charlie Pope (played by Miguel Ferrer) who goes to Mexico in the hope of curing his writer's block. He meets a beautiful woman, Natalie, but later he wakes up with a kidney missing. His kidney has gone into the human organs black-market. As he attempts to return the states, the people responsible want his other kidney.I have never heard of this movie and the plot has been done to death, but there are several twists and turns that kept me interested. There's also a cameo by George Clooney.

I remember going with my parents and grandparents to see Christmas Vacation at the theater back in 1989 (Just writing this makes me feel old.). It is the third film out four of the National Lampoon Vacation series and it is the best out of the sequels. It later spawned a spin-off sequel with Cousin Eddie, but it was dreadful to watch. Christmas Vacation is played to death thanks to CMT and Comedy Central. I would rather watch the unedited version on DVD.

I hate when someone posts a review months before the DVD actually comes out. I can understand if you had an advanced copy, but it seems people are writing reviews as soon as they hear about the release.Three of the shorts have previously appeared on other Looney Tunes releases, while the twelve others are new to DVD. Coyote Falls, Fur of Flying, and Rabid Rider are the new CGI shorts that were released to theaters with the moviesCats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'hoole, andYogi Bear (2010). These three are shorter than the average Looney Tunes shorts, but they are not webtoons like other reviewers have said.This is not the greatest Looney Tunes DVD release, but it is not as bad as what other reviewers have said it is.The 15 shorts are:Coyote FallsFur FlyingRabid RiderWhizzard of OwChariots of FurLittle Go BeepSugar and SpiesClippety ClobberedThe Solid Tin CoyoteOut and Out RoutShot and BotheredChaser on the RocksHighway RunneryBoulder Wham!Haired & Hurried

During the middle 1980s and early 1990s there was an animation boom on television. Very few made it past the first season as was the fate of The Legend of Zelda, based on the popular video game, which aired as a fifteen minute segment during The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! on Fridays on mainly Fox stations in 1989. There were only thirteen episodes aired during the series run, but it aired for a few more years in syndication.Even though I did own a Nintendo game system when I was a kid, I wasn't a big fan of The Legend of Zelda game, but I do recall watching the short-lived animated series. If I remember correctly the series aired in the mornings as I believed I watched it before going to school.I had completely forgotten about the series until I ran across Ganon's Evil Tower DVD this past Saturday at a thrift store. I bought it for a $1.50 and it is still in its original packaging. Each episode's plot typically has Link saving Princess Zelda from Ganon or some other villain.The 3 Episodes are:The Ringer (aired September 8, 1989) - The Amateur Magician's Contest is disturbed by Ganon's evil magic.Cold Spells (aired September 15, 1989) - To get out of spring-cleaning, Link pretends to have a cold, but when Spryte's magical powers go crazy, he must battle brooms, mops and dirty laundry.The White Knight (aired September 22, 1989) - Link becomes jealous when Zelda is attracted to Prince Facade.There are two mistakes on the back cover of the DVD case. First, Spryte is misspelled as Sprite. The other mistake is that the running time on the back cover has it as approx. 90 minutes when it is only 45 minutes.The Legend of Zelda is not the best animated series, which is probably why it only lasted one season. I'm not for sure why the studio only released three episodes to one DVD as they could have released the complete series at a cheap price. That being said, I'm still more than pleased that I only paid a $1.50 for it, but I did enjoyed watching it as it reminded me of my youth when life was a whole lot simpler.

I never even heard of Archie's Weird Mysteries (1999-2000) until I won several DVDs through a blog giveaway in which one of the DVDs wasBest of Archies Weird Mysterieswith the first 10 episodes.The series basically re-imagines some of the great 50s Scifi and horror movies with Archie and the gang investigating the strange happenings in Riverdale. After watching the first ten episodes, I wanted to watch the rest of the series.Luckily, I found it on Amazon for under ten dollars. There are four discs with 10 episodes on each. Disc one has a bonus episode from Sabrina: The Animated Series; disc two has a bonus episode from Sabrina's Secret Life; and disc three has a bonus from Mona the Vampire.Overall, I'm more than happy with purchase.

The plot of the series is that Sherlock Holmes, who was thought to be dead, is brought back to life after spending years being preserved in honey, which never rots, because of the increase of crimes are related to the 19 century criminal mind, Moriarty. Holmes teams up with the young Inspector Beth Lestrade, and assisted by a cyborg, who is using a program based on Holmes' old sidekick, Dr. John Watson. The cyborg is a dead ringer for Watson's personality and by the second episode, with the help of the 22nd century science, takes Watson's appearance as well. At first Holmes believes that criminal is a copycat, as Moriarty is dead. Or is he? Holmes quickly learns that his old nemesis has been cloned. Now Holmes has a new mission - to capture the new Moriarty.The premise is inspired of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, or should I say ripoff. Most of the episodes were based/inspired by the original stories and books written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I like the idea that Holmes stayed alive by being preserved in honey, but he was old when that happened, and now somehow he is a 25 year-old. It was a great idea to have Dr.John Watson as a Cyborg and for having Moriarty cloned. I was surprised the series was made thirteen years ago. Overall, I liked watching the series. I recommend it to both children and adults. This is a great way to introduce kids to the great Sherlock Holmes.

Season one debuted as a five-part miniseries (Some places aired it as a pilot movie titled Heroes in a Half Shell.) in December 1987.The DVD of Season One was released in 2004 on a single disc. There are no extras except for the four out-of-order episodes from Season 10, which can be a bit confusing for a new fan.The episodes on the DVD are:Turtle TracksEnter the ShredderA Thing About RatsHot-Rodding Teenagers From Dimension XShredded and SplinteredBonus Episodes from Season 10 are:The Beginning of the EndThe Return of DreggMonsters from Dimension XThe Day the Earth DisappearedThe original five episodes go more by the comics than the rest of the series did. This is must have for TMNT fans.

For the 25th anniversary, we got new TMNT meeting the 80s TMNT (along with Shredder, April, Master Splinter, Bebop, Rocksteady, and Krang). The plot is simple - after a dimensional portal accident, the 1987 turtles get transported to the 2003 incarnation. Meanwhile, the technodrome also got transported and the 1987 Shredder awakens the Utrom known as Ch'rell(aka the 2003 Shredder). Soon Karai (Ch'rell's daughter) arrives and helps her father get a new body. The New Shredder amps up the technodrome and plans on destroying all of the turtles' universes!The problem I have with Nickelodeon's US DVD release, is that it is the TV cut version and not the uncut version with the missing 8 minutes.I actually like the movie, despite the fact that none of the 1987's original voice actors returned. Some fans complain about the old turtles being dumb down, but I never saw that way. It was nice to see the turtle blimp and the party wagon have a cameo.

North by Northwest was originally released to theaters in the summer of 1959 by MGM and was directed by mastermind Alfred Hitchcock, one year beforePsycho (Collector's Edition)was released.Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive, is mistaken for George Kaplan and is kidnapped by two men who take him to a house in Long Island to be interrogated by a man claiming to be Lester Townsend, when he is actually a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm. Roger keeps telling him that he has the wrong person, but Vandamm doesn't believe him and order his men to get rid of Roger. They force him to drink bourbon and put him behind the wheel of a car. Then the men chase after him, hoping that Roger will crash the car, but to their surprise, he gets away.Knowing that he had no prove of what had happened, Roger decides to stop Vandamm from doing whatever he has planned to do. Roger had overheard that Vandamm was going to Chicago, so he hops on a train where he meets a lovely young woman, Eve Kendal, who turns out to be Vandamm's girlfriend.After getting off the train, Roger needs to travel by bus, but he first has to wait for one to appear along a countryside road. That's when the famous crop-duster scene occurs; diving down toward the very road Roger is on. It seems that no matter where he goes there are people after him.North By Northwestis a cleverly written thriller that takes you from New York to the top of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in cinema history and his direction alone makes the movie standout from all others. There are great performances by screen-legends Cary Grant and James Mason that highlight this mistaken identity tale. The movie may be over fifty years old, but it is better than any movie released to theaters today. Men will like the espionage plot while women will enjoy the romance scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Besides for some mild violence, the movie is a clean-cut film, so older kids can enjoy watching this classic movie too.

A few years ago I became hooked on the western Rawhide, then I came across Wanted: Dead or Alive: The Complete Series for under twenty dollars. I've seen most of McQueen's movies, so I thought I would try out this series and I'm glad that I did. The episodes run between 22 to 24 minutes and are well written compared to the junk that is on television today. There are many famous guest-stars like Michael Landon, Warren Oates, James Coburn, Le Van Cleef, DeForest Kelly, Lon Chaney Jr., and many others. I'm more than satisfied with the complete series.The episodes are:Disc One - Season 1The Martin PosterFatal MemoryThe BountyDead EndPassing of Shawnee BillThe Giveaway GunRansom for a NunMiracle at Pot HoleThe Fourth HeadstoneDisc Two - Season 1Til Death Do Us PartThe FavorRicochetSheriff of Red RockDie by the GunRawhide BreedEight Cent RewardDrop to DrinkRope LawDisc Three - Season 1Six-Up to BannachThe SpursReunion for a RevengeCompetitionCall Your ShotSecret BallotThe CornerEager ManThe LegendDisc Four - Season 1RailroadedDouble FeeThe Kovack AffairBounty for a BrideCrossroadsAngels of VengeanceLittlest ClientThe ConquerorsAmos CarterDisc Five - Season 2Montana KidThe Healing WomanThe MatchmakerBreakoutEstralitaThe HostageThe Empty CellBad GunDisc Six - Season 2The TyrantRecklessDesert SeedTwelve Hours to Crazy HorseNo Trail BackMan on HorsebackChain GangVanishing ActDisc Seven - Season 2Mental LapseAngelaThe MonsterMost Beautiful WomanJasonThe PartnersTolliver BenderA House DividedDisc Eight - Season 2Triple ViseBlack BeltThe PariahVendettaDeath Divided by ThreeThe InheritancePrison TrailPay-off at PintoDisc Nine - Season 3The TrialThe CureJourney for JoshThe LootersThe Twain Shall MeetThe ShowdownSurprise WitnessTo the VictorCriss-CrossDisc Ten - Season 3The Medicine ManOne Mother Too ManyThe ChoiceThree for OneWitch WomanBaa-BaaThe Last RetreatBounty on JoshHero in the DustDisc Eleven - Season 3EpitaphThe Voice of SilenceEl GatoDetourMonday MorningThe Long SearchDead ReckoningBarney's BountyFeaturettes: The Art of the Replicas, The Mare's Leg, Reckless, Winchester: A Weapon of Legend.

For the past four months, Penny Abbott (played by Stephanie Greco) has been working as a tour guide at The Whaley House, where Anna and three other members of the Whaley family died during the 1800s. Penny is a skeptic and doesn't believe in the ghostly encounters that tourists claim to see there, even when a new tourist has to be hospitalized after claiming that she saw ghosts.Penny is close with Bethany Romero (played by Lynn Lowry), who has been running the museum for over thirty years. She gives Penny three rules of the Whaley House that you should never break.Don't Call the Ghosts OutDon't Damage the HouseDon't Ever Go Inside the House at NightAfter Penny tells her boyfriend Jake and their three friends, Vanessa, Craig, and Giselle about the incident with the tourist, they persuade Penny to go with them to the house that night to see if there are any real ghosts. She agrees and lets them inside the house, along with Ray, who has all the paranormal gadgets and gizmos, and the famous psychic, Keith Drummond.As they attempt to investigate, Vanessa flips out just like the tourist did and an accident occurs. What they don't know is that Anna Whaley's spirit doesn't like unwanted guests at night and one by one she'll claim all of their souls.The ASYLUM Home Entertainment was nice enough to send me a free DVD in exchange for this review. The Haunting of Whaley House is similar to The ASYLUM's other recent release100th Street Haunting (The Ghost of Richard Speck), as both plots are based on actual haunted locations. Due to budget restraints, they couldn't afford to film the movie at the actual Whaley House (an official Haunted House by the United States Commerce Department), so they found another creepy looking house for the movie.The plot is simple; a group of friends sneak into a haunted house looking for ghosts. The premise works well for horror films, but one of the problems I had with it is that the characters are just too old to be breaking into a house looking for ghosts. If they characters were teenagers, I can understand that, or if they characters were doing research for a college project. The acting in the movie is mediocre at best, except for Stephanie Greco, and the small appearance by screen legend, Lynn Lowry, who gave a great performance. Since I don't watch horror movies for the acting, I can overlook this.The cinematography throughout the movie was well done considering the low-budget and I consider it to be better than some theatrical movies. I liked the fact that they used old-fashioned scares with the occasional bloody scenes, and of course the cameo by Mindy Robinson.The Haunting of Whaley Houseoffers nothing new to the horror genre, but it does offer a frightening atmosphere and quirky dialogue that should satisfy most horror fans.

I can't stand the majority of today's cartoons, but Phineas and Ferb is an exception due to the creative writing behind the show. Typically, each episode has two segments, and each segment is split between Phineas/Ferb/Candace and Perry!The episodes on this DVD are:1. No More Bunny Business/ Spa Day2. Split Personality/ Brain Drain3. Candace Disconnected/ Magic Carpet Ride4. Ask A Foolish Question/ Misperceived Monotreme5. Mommy Can You Hear Me?/ Road Trip6. Perry The Actorpus/ Bullseye!7. Escape From The Tower/ The Remains of the PlatypusThis is a great DVD to own. My favorite segment is Road Trip, where Phineas and Ferb build and operate a truck stop diner over their parent's moving RV.

Steven Seagal plays an ex-CIA agent Travis Hunter in the 2005 direct-to-DVD Into the Sun. Hunter is brought in to look into the murder of Tokyo's governor along with his new FBI partner Sean Mac (played by Vampire Diaries' Matthew Davis). The murder is linked to the Japanese mafia known as Yakuza. Hunter was raised in Japan and knows the customs, but his new partner doesn't know about the culture and is more of a distraction. Hunter ends up sending Mac on a surveillance mission, but it ends up in disaster. As Hunter gets closer to the killers, Yakuza kills someone close to him, resulting in Hunter taking matters into his own hands.Despite from the incorrect CIA/FBI jargon, Into the Sun wasn't a bad action flick. Yes, the whole drug kingpin plot has been done to death, but there are some decent sword fighting scenes that kept the movie likeable.

From the producers of the Final Destination movies comes Autopsy that was released to theaters as part of the 8 Films to Die For during the After Dark Horrorfest III. A group of friends hit a man with their car while they are on their way back from Mardi Gras. An ambulance soon arrives taking the victim and the group to a strange hospital. To find out, Dr. Benway (played by Robert Patrick) is experimenting with humans at the hospital in an attempt to save his dying wife.The movie starts out a little slow with average acting for a horror movie. The movie is a splatter-fest with blood and gore around every corner. The doctor isn't afraid to split your stomach open or drill into your skull. I give the director credit for not using CGI special effects. The movie isn't perfect, but it is better than the majority of other torture porn that is out on DVD.

After the success of House of Dark Shadows, MGM greenlit a sequel Curse of Dark Shadows. By the time production near, the soap series was canceled by ABC and actor Jonathan Frid didn't want to return as fear of being typecast. Therefore, the co-writer and director Dan Curtis (creator of Dark Shadows) changed the title to Night of Dark Shadows and focused the main character onto Quentin Collins (played by David Selby), whom was absent from the previous film. This time the plot didn't involve vampires, but returned to Dark Shadows original theme of ghosts.Quentin Collins along with his wife Tracy (played by Kate Jackson) arrives at their newly-inherited estate, Collinwood, as most of the Collins were killed in the previous film. Actress Grayson Hall returns, but she's playing a new role as the housekeeper Carlotta Drake. The couple is introduced to her and the caretaker Gerard Stiles. There is no mentioned of the events that happened in House of Dark Shadows.The couple's novelists' friends Alex and Claire Jenkins (Played by returning actors John Karlen and Nancy Barrett, but in different roles.) move into the small cottage that is located on the estate. Quentin soon has weird and realistic dreams about his ancestor Charles Collins, who had an affair with Angelique (Once again played by actress Lara Parker.). Upon hearing about his dreams, Carlotta tells him that she is the reincarnation of Sarah Castle, a girl who once lived at Collinwood, and that he is the reincarnation of Charles Collins. Charles had a passionate affair with his brother's wife, Angelique. Because of their actions, Angelique was hanged and Charles was buried alive in her crypt.Quentin becomes possessed by the spirit of Charles Collins and tries to drown Tracy. Meanwhile, the ghost of Angelique is haunting everyone.The Night of Dark Shadows was somewhat inspired by the Angelique storyline, minus her being a witch, and the 1970 parallel timeline episodes. With the Dark Shadows serial being cancelled, MGM had lost faith with the movie. With hardly little notice, less than twenty-four hours, the executives forced Dan Curtis to cut the movie down so it could be aired in midnight double features. In today's words the movie was being sent straight-to-video. The result was the original 129 minutes running time being cut to 95 minutes. The final result left the main plot confusing, the characters one dimensional, and overall the movie looses its coherence.The heart of the movie is a Gothic romantic novel. The scenes with the stunning Lara Parker are my favorites, but I would have liked it if Dan had left her a witch. But then again, I like that Dan used the basic ghost plot from the original year of the Dark Shadows serial. There is some good news. Back in 1999 the lost 35 minutes (16 scenes) were recovered, but with no surviving audio. Since then Warner Bros. (who is producing the remake) has bought both the movie's rights. They are restoring the movie to its original 129 minutes length along with new audio that has been created with the surviving actors. It was planned to be released along with House of Dark Shadows six months after the release of the remake, but the running time of Amazon has the DVD around ninety minutes. It looks the fans won't get a chance to see the original version unless the director's cut is an extra, but highly doubt it.Despite Night of Dark Shadows being heavily edited, I enjoyed Dan Curtis's attempt at the dark ghostly Gothic romance, in which he's trying to do things he couldn't do on television at the time. Sadly, the movie was a complete flop and there was never a third movie made.

After the success of House of Dark Shadows, MGM greenlit a sequel Curse of Dark Shadows. By the time production near, the soap series was canceled by ABC and actor Jonathan Frid didn't want to return as fear of being typecast. Therefore, the co-writer and director Dan Curtis (creator of Dark Shadows) changed the title to Night of Dark Shadows and focused the main character onto Quentin Collins (played by David Selby), whom was absent from the previous film. This time the plot didn't involve vampires, but returned to Dark Shadows original theme of ghosts.Quentin Collins along with his wife Tracy (played by Kate Jackson) arrives at their newly-inherited estate, Collinwood, as most of the Collins were killed in the previous film. Actress Grayson Hall returns, but she's playing a new role as the housekeeper Carlotta Drake. The couple is introduced to her and the caretaker Gerard Stiles. There is no mentioned of the events that happened in House of Dark Shadows.The couple's novelists' friends Alex and Claire Jenkins (Played by returning actors John Karlen and Nancy Barrett, but in different roles.) move into the small cottage that is located on the estate. Quentin soon has weird and realistic dreams about his ancestor Charles Collins, who had an affair with Angelique (Once again played by actress Lara Parker.). Upon hearing about his dreams, Carlotta tells him that she is the reincarnation of Sarah Castle, a girl who once lived at Collinwood, and that he is the reincarnation of Charles Collins. Charles had a passionate affair with his brother's wife, Angelique. Because of their actions, Angelique was hanged and Charles was buried alive in her crypt.Quentin becomes possessed by the spirit of Charles Collins and tries to drown Tracy. Meanwhile, the ghost of Angelique is haunting everyone.The Night of Dark Shadows was somewhat inspired by the Angelique storyline, minus her being a witch, and the 1970 parallel timeline episodes. With the Dark Shadows serial being cancelled, MGM had lost faith with the movie. With hardly little notice, less than twenty-four hours, the executives forced Dan Curtis to cut the movie down so it could be aired in midnight double features. In today's words the movie was being sent straight-to-video. The result was the original 129 minutes running time being cut to 95 minutes. The final result left the main plot confusing, the characters one dimensional, and overall the movie looses its coherence.The heart of the movie is a gothic romantic novel. The scenes with the stunning Lara Parker are my favorites, but I would have liked it if Dan had left her a witch. But then again, I like that Dan used the basic ghost plot from the original year of the Dark Shadows serial. There is some good news.

They are restoring the movie to its original 129 minutes length along with new audio that has been created with the surviving actors. It is planned to be released along with House of Dark Shadows six months after the release of the remake, so hopefully they'll be out by the end of the year.Despite Night of Dark Shadows being heavily edited, I enjoyed Dan Curtis's attempt at the dark ghostly gothic romance, in which he's trying to do things he couldn't do on television at the time.

After the disappointed Garfield Gets Real, I wasn't looking forward to watching Garfield's Funfest, but I ended up liking it. Frank Welker does an excellent job as voicing the new Garfield.

I actually bought the Muppets on DVD this week. I haven't been a Muppet film in probably twenty years. I recall watching a few of the movies and The Muppet Babies cartoon series, but I have lost touch with these cute characters. I remember seeing this movie advertise at the theater last year and I thought it would be horrible due to the fact that Jason Segel is in it. Surprisingly, I wasn't annoyed with his character, even though it is unbelievable that Amy Adams' character actually liked him. All the Muppet characters are back, but some of them could have had more screen time, like Fozzie Bear - who didn't have much to do. The movie is cute for kids with enough humor for adults to enjoy it as well.

The Book of Love is the final entry in the American Pie Presents series and it is the worst. Eugene Levy's cameo can't help this outrageous and unfunny sequel. Well, actually it is a recycled version of all the American Pies with the reintroduction of the book of love. The cast has no chemistry and the script feels like it is a first draft. Yes, there's graphic nudity, graphic language, sexual situations, and gross out humor, but it is all done in bad taste. There are a few scenes that attempted to be funny, but failed to do so. I bought the movie for a $1.96 at a Black Friday sale, otherwise I would have never watched it.

It seems that Warner Bros. is getting lazy in releasing the full seasons of the Smurfs to DVD, as the video quality is not the best. In A Magical Smurf Adventure, we only get ten episodes on two discs, running about 190 minutes. The back of the DVD box says it is the Second Season, but it is actually mixed episodes from the entire series. Talk about false advertisement! Why doesn't Warner Bros. just release a full season for us fans? I'm hoping with the new Smurf movie sequel being released next year, that maybe there will a new Smurf full season DVD out.Disc 1:Smurf Van WinkleRevenge of the SmurfsThe Magic FountainSmurf Me No FlowersThe Cursed CountryDisc 2:The Blue PlagueThe Ring of CostellacA Mere TruffleGormandizing GreedySister SmurfSPECIAL FEATURES:Smurf Speak; Express Yourself the Smurf WaySmurftastic Moments: 10 Top Moments from the Smurfs' Second Season

In this fantasy adventure quest, the orphan hero, Rokey, was raised in a monastery. After an accident occurs, Rokey leaves his home and explores Firma. He is almost robbed when a elf named Flaskamber saves him.Rokey joins the Elf's group of friends led by Stanford. There is also Fia the bard and Lorq the giant. Soon they are attacked by ratmen, who are after Rokey. Why would they be after this orphan?The Orphan's Quest is your typical fantasy with all the clich&eacute;s that go with it. The only thing that stands out is that the main hero, Rokey, is gay, and there is a romance between him and Flaskamber. I'm sure that fantasy fans will like this novel, but it really didn't interest me. Many of the questions that rises in the book are unanswered by the disappointing ending.

After being disappointed with the first movie, I was skeptical about seeing Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, but the movie was given to me a few years ago for Christmas. Surprisingly, I actually liked it, thanks to Billy Connolly and Billy Murray as the voice of Garfield. I would have liked it even better if all the animals were computer animated, especially Odie. The farm animals should have been the characters would U.S. Acres!Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties is not a perfect movie, but it is better than the first.

There are two stories in this book. The first story is in the point of view of the sister, The Great One. She complains about her younger brother being annoying. She thinks her parents like him more.The second story is in the point of view of the brother, the Pain. He thinks his older sister is annoying. He thinks his parents love her more.This is a great picture book with a lot of truth to it. This is how real siblings at this age act. Parents will love reading this book to their kids.

I wasn't expecting much from The TMNT game, which is based on the 2007 film. I only paid twenty dollars for it at Walmart a few years ago. It sat around unopened until I was bored one night and gave the game a try. I've been disappointed in the past with the other TMNT video game releases, so I was shockingly surprised that I actually loved playing this game. It's got cool graphics, a great storyline, and lots of action. The only problem I found in it is that it wasn't challenging enough, as I got through the game fairly quickly. Overall, it is one my favorite PS2 games to play.

The Secret World of Arrietty is a 2010 animated Japanese film based on the award winning novel The Borrowers by Mary Norton. It was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and produced by Studio Ghibli. After a successful run in Japan, and winning the Animation of the Year Award at the 34 Japan Academy Price, it was released in the Untied States by Walt Disney Pictures in early 2012. Disney's release had an American dub with the voices of Bridgit Mendler, David Henrie, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler and Carol Burnett.A boy named Shawn is sent to live with his great aunt Jessica's, the same house his mother had grew up in. Shawn's parents are busy with work and don't have the time to take care him. He is going to have heart in a few weeks and needs to rest. His mother told him about the little people who live in the walls, of course Shawn thinks it was just a story, but he was wrong.Shawn awakens one night to see two borrowers, Arrietty and her father, Pod. Scared at the Shawn seeing them, they run away and the sugar cube (which they borrowed) falls out of her bag. The next day Shawn leaves the cube and a note near an underground air vent. She tells her parents, whom tells her to not to touch it. Eventually, she decides to return the cube to Shawn. After an incident with a crow, Shawn and Arrietty become friends.The maid named Haru discovers that there are borrowers among them and decides to capture one of them, Arrietty's mother, Homily. Then Shawn and Arrietty come up with a plan to save her.I grew up on The Littles television series based on the book by John Peterson, which was inspired by The Borrowers. After seeing The Secret World of Arreitty advertise on the Disney Channel, I planned on buying it when it came out on DVD. I don't watch a lot of Japanese animation, but I liked the style of this film. From the colors to the sound, I felt like I was in a borrower's world. There are some differences between the movie and the original book, but it didn't disrupt me from loving it. Since the American version is released by Disney, two of the voice actors, Bridgit Mendler and David Henrie, are from shows on the Disney Channel. This is a great family film that both children and adults will cherish.

In this twisted spin on The Christmas Carol, Bill Murray plays a television executive Frank Cross, who happens to gets a few visits by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. This is another favorite of mine from my childhood. The movie has held up well over the years and it is still played on several cable channels during Christmastime.

Late at night on July 13, 1966, Richard Speck entered the 2319 East 100th Street townhouse that was serving as a dormitory for student nurses and took eight women hostages. Over the course of several hours, Speck murdered six of the eight women by either stabbing or strangling them to death. The seventh victim was raped and then strangled. The eighth woman managed to escape by hiding under the bed. Speck must have lost count, as a ninth woman, who was visiting the other women, stayed hidden until the next morning when she yelled out the window for help.The police found a smudged fingerprint that belonged to Speck at the crime scene. The police found Speck only after he attempted suicide at a hotel. Speck was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death on November 22, 1968. On November 21, 1972, a judge reversed the death sentence and re-sentenced him to 400 to 1,200 years in prison. Speck was later given the nickname "Birdman" because he kept a pair of sparrows in his cell. Speck died on December 5, 1991 from a heart attack.2319 East 100th Street has become one of the most haunted places in Chicago. The ASYLUM Home Entertainment has recently released their newest horror movie to DVD and Blu-Ray titled100th Street Haunting (The Ghost of Richard Speck)that was filmed in a documentary style in the tradition of theThe Blair Witch Project.In the film a group of paranormal investigators investigated the famous townhouse back in 2010, in which nobody survived the night. The Illinois police release the video footage to the public. The townhouse is surrounded by a metal gate, which locks the investigators inside. Cell phones do not work because of the paranormal activity, leaving them with no way of contacting the outside. They are trained ghost investigators with the latest gizmos and gadgets, and they are all hoping to make contact with a ghost, but unknowingly to them the ghost of Richard Speck is there and he doesn't like outsiders. One by one, the investigators are brutally murdered by unseen Speck.I'm not into documentary style horror films, but it really does work in100 Ghost Street: The Return of Richard Speck. The grainy film helps give them the movie a feel of reality. I've seen many low-budget horrors, in which most have bad acting, but all the actors in 100 Ghost Street give above average performances, making me to actually believe that I was watching real ghost hunters on "live" television. What makes the plot freaky is that Richard Speck was actually a real mass-murderer. The house used in the film is not the real 2319 East 100th Street townhouse as I assumed no film company can ever be allowed to film a horror movie there. There are no credits at the end of the movie, making the viewer believe that the movie actually happened, when it is really a fictional horror tale. 100 Ghost Streets proves that you don't have to spend millions of dollars to create a good horror movie. I'm glad that you never actually see Richard Speck, only a few quick ghostly glimpses toward the end. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the movie for what it was - an old-fashioned horror movie.

It seems like the old Grimm's fairy tales are becoming popular again thanks to the television series Once Upon A Time, and of course the lackluster comedy Mirror, Mirror and the dark Snow White and the Huntsman. Early this year The ASYLUM brought out their own titled Grimm's Snow White to DVD starring Eliza Bennett (Inkheart), Jamie Thomas King, and Jane March on a much lower budget.The plot follows the basic Snow White formula, but there are a number of differences. After Snow's father is eaten by a lizard-dragon, Prince Alexander arrives shortly after and offers to marry the now widowed Queen Gwendolyn. After rejecting his offer (for now), the Prince meets the beautiful Snow White and he instantly falls for her. Meanwhile, the Queen's mirror tells her that Snow is fairer than her, therefore she sends her huntsman to take Snow into the forest and murder her.Snow is rescued by elves. The huntsman is forced to kill an innocent man and brings his heart to the Queen, telling her it belongs to her stepdaughter. The Prince is heartbroken, while the Queen is thrilled as her plan to rule the kingdom is unfolding, which includes destroying the elves and taking their magic. The magical elves are the dwarfs in this tale, and they take the poor Snow into their home.The Queen finds out the huntsman lied, and she has an elf servant turn her into an old woman. In disguise, the Queen gives Snow not an apple, but a ring, which makes her sleep. Instead of the Princess awakening her with a kiss, he slips the Queen's ring off and replaces it with his own, awakening Snow.The Queen gathers her forces and plans on overthrowing the elves, but the elves have their own small army and Snow White with her bow and arrows.The ASYLUM Home Entertainment nicely sent me a complimentary DVD for this reviews, I was eager to watch Grimm's Snow White directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg from the screenplay by Naomi Selfman. Over the years Hollywood has lightened up the dark themed Grimm's fairy tales, so it is great to see new versions being released this year. As you can see from the DVD cover, Snow White is a blonde in this version. I know this may upset some people, but it didn't bother me all. In the very early versions, Grimm's referred to Snow as having "yellow" hair. Also, Disney considered having their Snow White as a blonde in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.The acting for the most part is good, with Eliza Bennett (Snow) and Jane March (the Queen) standing out from the rest. The CGI special effects are low-budget, as the lizard-dragons are silly, and I'm glad they don't have that big of a part in the movie. The Queen's hounds look great when they are up close, but when they are running or attacking the effects are out of sync with the background. Replacing the dwarfs with elves was a nice touch, adding something new to the old Snow tale. One thing does bother me. Why didn't Snow ever mourn the death the death of her father? She never cried once, she was happy. I was disappointed that the huntsman only brought the Queen a heart, as in the original story he was suppose to bring the heart, liver, and the lungs as proof of Snow's death.I have seen a few other ASYLUM films and I have to say the production quality is better in this film. The film was shot in Austria and all the forest scenes look great. The movie contains a few scenes of violence, mostly involving the lizard/dragon, the hounds, and of the finale's battle scene, but there is nothing graphic, making this feels like more of a family fantasy. Overall, despite a few flaws, I enjoyed watching the Grimm's Snow White, and I recommend it to others.

Hollow Man is an updated version of The Invisible Man that was released back in 2000. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist, who has created a serum that can turn a gorilla invisible, but now he wants to experiment on himself despite the objections of his ex-girlfriend Dr. Linda McKay (played by Elizabeth Shue)and her boyfriend Dr. Matt Kensington (played by Josh Brolin). Within days, Sebastian starts to go mad with his new power of invisibility. At first he is just pranking his fellow colleagues, but then he starts killing them one by one.I saw Hollow Man when if first came out and now again on DVD. It's not as bad as other reviewers have claimed it to be. Yes, the characters are not well developed, but horror movies never have much character depth. Even twelve years later, the special effects are pretty amazing.

I remember walking up to grocery store (at the time I lived in a very small town) when I was a kid with my aunt (who's only six years older than me). The grocery store had a very limited VHS rentals, in which we rented Critters 2 and House II. I had seen the first House a few years before when my parents bought it. And I seen the original Critters on the big screen, as my uncle demanded that the movie was funny, but mom and grandma had a different opinion after taking my aunt and me to see it. Anyway, I have fond memories of House II, despite it being less creepy than the first one. House II has more comedy, prehistoric creatures (and 80's cheap special effects), a crystal skull, and zombie gunslingers. Overall, it is cheesy horror fun.

Val Kilmer stars as a disabled ex-Marine William "Spooky" Macpherson in the 2008 direct-to-DVD Conspiracy that is somewhat inspired by 1955 film Bad Day at Black Rock which was based on the short story Bad Time at Honda by Howard Breslin. After receiving a phone call from a fellow Marine, Spooky packs up what little belongings that he owns and travels to border town of New Lago. To his surprise, nobody in the town has ever heard of his friend and he is not wanted there. He soon learns that the small town is owned and controlled by John Rhodes (played by Gary Cole). Spooky is arrested, but quickly escapes to lead a one man war against Rhodes and his crooked sheriff office.Conspiracy is another action movie that I have never heard of before. The premise is interesting and Val Kilmer and Gary Cole do their best, but there are numerous plot holes. The Marine jargon is incorrect and the supporting cast is horrible. New Lago looks like it came out of the 1800s. The town looked more like a tourist attraction than a realistic small town. I don't care much for Val Kilmer, but he does a decent job with what little he had to work with. Gary Cole is the best part of the film as the corrupted villain. In the end, I did find Conspiracy to be somewhat entertaining with a few decent action scenes.

I rented The 40-Year-Old Virgin when it first came out and I thought it was a horrible movie. Since then I have caught the movie a few times on basic cable channels and I now have a new respect for it. I stumbled upon the unrated DVD at a Walmart store yesterday and I have to say that he movie isn't as vulgar as I remember it to be. Actually, it's pretty funny in several places, especially the waxing scene. Paul Rudd steals every scene that he is in as Steve Carell's goofy co-worker. The movie isn't for everyone, but I do have a newfound respect for it.

I stumbled upon Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat for five dollars at Walmart with five other movies. I thought I had seen all of Bruce Campbell's movies, but I was wrong. The movie was released back in 1989 and also stars David Carradine, Morgan Brittany, Jim Metzler, Maxwell Caulfield, and Deborah Foreman.The movie takes place in a small town of Purgatory, where all the citizens are vampires. These vampires have been living on synthetic blood (pre-True Blood), until the the factory that produces it has a problem. A human, David Harrison, along with his wife and daughters, arrive in Purgatory to help fix the factory. Count Margulak (aka Dracula) is the ruler of the town and wants to keep their life simple, while another vampire is building an army so he can overthrow Margulak. Robert Van Helsing, played by Bruce Campbell, comes walking into town on the intent of killing Margulak, but he gets sidetrack by the beautiful vamp, Sandy White.I didn't expect much from the movie, but I was entertained for the entire 104 minutes.

Steven Seagal plays Marshall Lawson, a commander of an elite military unit, in the 2008 direct-to-DVD Attack Force. While in Paris, three of his soldiers are brutally murdered in their hotel room. He starts his own investigation into their deaths with the help of his much younger girlfriend, Tia, and his military friend Dwayne. He learns that the soldiers deaths are linked to a military drug called CTX, in which Tia was one of the original scientist that helped create it. Whoever takes the CTX becomes an unstoppable killing machine.I'm not the biggest Seagal fan and it has been awhile since I have seen one of his movies, but Attack Force has to be the worst. The plot is unrealistic and confusing. The fights scenes are ridiculous, the acting is laughable, and half of Seagal's lines are dubbed due to the script being changed after the movie was filmed. Attack Force is one of the worst movies ever made.

I first started watching Law & Order Criminal Intent in the spring of 2007 when USA use to have nightly mini-marathons of CI and SVU. The series first aired on NBC on September 30, 2001 until May 21, 2007, when it moved to its sister network USA in the fall of 2007 until it finally ended its run on June 26, 2011. NBCUniversal have been extremely slow about releasing Law & Order: CI's ten year run to DVD. Luckily for us fans, Shout! Factory bought the DVD rights, releasing season 7 exactly one year to the date that the series ended.Just like the previous few seasons, every other episode is split between the detective combo of Goren/Eames and Logan/Wheeler. Actually, Megan Wheeler (played by Julianne Nicholson, who was on maternity leave) is missing for half the season as the character went to Europe to teach a course on American Police Procedure. During this time, Mike Logan (played by Chris Noth) teams up with Detective Nola Falaccia (played by Alicia Witt).The season starts out with Amends, in which Eames' (played by Kathryn Erbe) late husband's partner is murdered, and Goren must help her find the killer. My favorite episode is Untethered, where Goren (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) goes undercover in a psychiatric ward to help his nephew and must confront his own demons. The season ends with Frame, where Goren's brother is murdered, and the prime suspect could be Goren's nemesis, Nicole Wallace.The episodes on the five discs are:Disc One: Amends; Seeds; Smile; and Lonelyville.Disc Two: Depths; Courtship; Self-Made; and Offense.Disc Three: Untethered; Senseless: Purgatory; and Contract.Disc Four: Betrayed; Assassin; Please Note We Are No Longer Accepting Letters of Recommendation From Henry Kissinger; Reunion; and Vanishing Act.Disc Five: Ten Count; Legacy; Neighborhood Watch; Last Rites; and Frame.Unlike the box sets of seasons, 4-6, season seven has no box; there is just a slipcover over a typical DVD case. The DVD cover is in the same design style of the previous few seasons as is the discs' design. Season seven aired from October 7, 2007 to June 24, 2008 and not during the '08-'09 Season as stated on the cover and on each discs. Just like the previous seasons, there are no extras in this set.Despite the '08-09' error and the lack of extras, I am glad that season 7 is finally on DVD to own.

Even though the movie has slightly grown on me, it is still a horrible movie due to not having a plot and bad CGI effects. I stumbled upon the PS2 game a few years ago at a dollar store for only five dollars, so I thought I would give it a try. Surprisingly, the game is better written than the actually movie. Unlike most movie tie-in games, Van Helsing is actually challenging. Overall, I had fun playing the game.

I've been looking for Drowning Mona on DVD for several years. I finally found it on Amazon.com last week and I got it in the mail yesterday. It reminds me of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (which also stars Danny Devito) as it is so stupid its funny.In this dark comedy, Mona Dearly (played by Bette Midler) drove herself into a river, but the Chief of Police Wyatt Rash (played by Danny Devito) thinks otherwise. As he investigates her death, he finds out that the whole town are suspects as Mona was not the nicest person in world. She abused her husband, Phil (played by William Fichtner),and she chopped off her own son's hand. Others suspects are Phil's mistress/waitress, Rona (played by Jamie Lee Curtis), the police chiefs daughter, Ellen (played by Neve Campbell), and her fiance' Bobby (played by Casey Affleck).The movie is hilarious! William Fichtner as Phil is the best character in the movie, especially when he plays Wheel of Fortune. Melissa McCarthy, Will Ferrell, and Kathleen Wilhoite also have small parts in the movie.

Instead of releasing Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection 3, Warner Bros. released The Movie Collection, which is still considered as the Spotlight Collection 3 as the following Looney Tunes release was the Spotlight Collection 4!This collection consist of the 1979 movie The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie and the 1982 movie Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales.

I use to watch Saved by the Bell when I was a kid, well I think everyone I grew up with watched it. The showed aired in the mornings, in the afternoons and of course on Saturday mornings. I would run home after school as fast as I could so I won't miss it, even though I had probably seen each episode three times by then. I quit watching the franchise afterSaved by the Bell: The College Years (Complete Series)ended, though I do recall coming acrossSaved by the Bell - The New Class, Season 1a few times while channel surfing.The series aired for years on TBS in the early mornings, but I never watched any of the reruns. The show has held up well over the years compared to other teen shows of the early 90sSaved by the Bell - Seasons 1 & 2was a retooled version of the short lived Disney Channel series Good Morning, Miss Bliss. The characters Zack Morris, Samuel "Screech" Powers, Lisa Turtle, and Mr. Richard Belding transitioned over to the new show which premiered on NBC in August of 1989, becoming one of the most popular teen series of all time despite being critically bashed.The character Zack Morris became the main character, which is the Bayside High School prankster/schemer. During most of the first season Zack and the new Bayside student, A.C. Slater, fight for the attention of the sweetheart cheerleader Kelly Kapowski. Zack always gets what he wants even if that means tricking the teachers or the principal, Mr. Belding. Normally, his sidekick Screech (one of the school's nerds) helps him in his schemes, when Screech isn't drooling over his crush, Lisa. And of course there is Jessie Spano, the school's know-it-all.I guess there is a little bit of a debate on how many seasons the show actually had. Saved by the Bell aired for four seasons which represented their freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years, but the way NBC filmed the series was in five different batches, so technically there was actually five seasons filmed. The episodes were always aired out of order with the pilot airing later in the season, which involved Slater's first day at Bayside. When the series went into syndication, the episodes were slightly edited and aired in a different order, but still chronologically wrong. The Good Morning, Miss Bliss episodes were retooled for syndication with a new opening title of "Saved by the Bell" and a new introduction from Zack Morris to bridge the gap between the two series.The Season 1 and 2 dvd set contains mixed episodes of the original airings and the syndication versions. The set contains 32 episodes and follows the syndication order and is missing a few episodes from the second season.The episodes included in this set are:Disc 1 - Dancing to the Max; The Lisa Card; The Gift; Fatal Distraction; Screech's Woman; Aloha Slater, The Substitute; Cream for a DayDisc 2 - Pinned to the Mat; The Beauty and the Screech; The Friendship Business; The Mamas and the Papas; Save that Tiger; The Election; The Zack TapesDisc 3 - King of the Hill; The Babysitters; Close Encounters of the Nerd Kind; Slater's Friend; Screech's BirthdayDisc 4 - The Prom; Zack's War; Save the Max; Driver's Education; House Party; Model Students; Blind Date; Rent-A-PopDisc 5 - Miss Bayside; Jessie's Song; 1-900-Crushed; Running Zack; From Nurse to WorseWhat a nostalgia kick I had while watching these old episodes of Saved by the Bell. I had completely forgotten about the kids' hangout The Max and Screech's robot, Kevin. One of my favorite episodes is on this set, Screech's Woman. Zack can't find anyone to go out with Screech, so with the help of Jessie and Lisa, he dresses up as a girl and goes by the name Bambi so he can try lift up Screech's self-esteem.I recently joined the Premiere Blogger Program from Mommy Bear Media where you can find the best new movies on dvd, in which I received this Saved by the Bell dvd set courtesy of the program. The shipping was really fast, I think it took only two days to get the set. With every order you get free shipping! Some online stores charge a lot for shipping, so I was impressed with the free shipping on the order.In less than a week, I watched the entire set by watching a few episodes in the mornings and a several at night. Some of the plots are a little silly, but the characters are fun to watch, and are more family friendly than most of current shows on television. You can buy the first and second season set for under twenty dollars. That's cheap for hours of entertainment that you can enjoy with your entire family.

Beta House is one of the DVDs that I bought on Black Friday at my local Walmart for a $1.96, which is the third entry in the American Pie Present franchise. As with any American Pie movie, this movie is raunchy with full frontal female nudity, graphic language, strong sexual content and gross out humor. Out of the four Presents movies, Beta House is the only real sequel, starring the previous film's,American Pie - The Naked Mile (Unrated Widescreen Edition)characters, Dwight and Erik Stifler. Of course Eugene Levy returns as Noah Levenstein.The plot is a mix of Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, and Old School, only this time it is reversed as the nerds have the popular fraternity and the jocks have the poor fraternity.I actually ended up liking Beta House even though it was raunchy. It's not the best in the franchise, but it is lot better thanAmerican Pie Presents: The Book of Love (Unrated)andAmerican Pie Presents: Band Camp (Unrated).

This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.Here we get the two part episode Deep Trouble, in which brother and sister, Billy and Sheena, are visiting their uncle Dr. Deep on a small island in the Caribbean. Billy is all excited about having an island adventure, that is until he comes face to face with a half-human, half-fish creature.Deep Trouble is in the style of 50s and 60s B-Movies. Little kids will like this adventure tale.

The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.Cry of the Cat is a freaky story about a child actress who is stalked by a mysterious black cat, Rip, who is killed over and over again. The cat keeps coming back, leading the girl to a very strange house.This is one of the weirdest episodes of the series with an even weirder twist at the end.

Considering the low-budget and below average acting that came with every episode of the Goosebumps series, I was impressed with How I Got My Shrunken Head. Mark is spending some time with his Aunt Benna in the jungle island of Baladora. He is given a strange shrunken head that glows at night. Strange things happen and this trip may be his last.

National Velvet was released to theaters back on December 14, 1944 and is based on the novelNational Velvetby Helen Deutsch. The movie is mostly set in Sewels, Sussex, England and stars a young Elizabeth Taylor as Velvet Brown who dreams of owning her own horse. On her way home from school, she meets a young drifter named Mi Taylor (played by Mickey Rooney) who looking for Velvet's mother. He had found Mrs. Brown's name and address in his late father's possessions.The Browns hire Mi to help out around their farm and at their store. They also allow him to sleep in the barn. Velvet and Mi become friends despite the fact that Mi hates horses as he use to be a jockey.A local farmer is raffling his horse "Pirate", because the horse is wild. The horse likes to get jump the fence and create chaos throughout the small village, practically putting the owner in debt. Despite the Browns rejections, Mi buys several raffles and gives them to Velvet and her siblings. To her luck, she wins the horse that she renames Pie.Velvet has great faith in Pie and wants to enter him into the Grand National. She talks Mi into helping her train Pie for the great race and her mother gives her 100 pounds to enter into the race.I've never really cared for watching horse racing movies, or horse moves in general, butNational Velvetwas under five dollars and has a great cast (It even has the dog Daisy from the Blondie movies as the Browns' family dog.), so I decided to give it a try. Considering the age of the movie, the film looks great on DVD! Elizabeth Taylor gives a great performance as Velvet, the girl who loves horses, but my favorite character was Mi Taylor played by Mickey Rooney, as he is a flawed character. Several times he has a great amount of money in his hands, but he cares for the Browns and he doesn't want to disappoint them. The running time is a little over two hours, but I was so into the movie that it felt less than that. I recommend everyone to watch National Velvet.

After flying through Dead as a Doornail, I jumped into Definitely Dead. Sookie Stackhouse is now over her ex-boyfriend, Bill Compton, and her other lover, Eric, and she is ready to get on with her life. That's when Quinn, a weretiger, shows interest in her and they soon start dating. The Pelts family comes to Bon Temps looking for clues to where their daughter's, Debbie, whereabouts, and Sookie is doing everything to ignore them. When Sookie's life starts to turn average, the unexpected happens. Her cousin, Hadley, passed away. Hadley was a consort to the New Orleans Vampire Queen.After learning that she is the heir to Hadley's estate, Sookie begins unraveling her cousin's dark secrets. Rogue werewolves are on her trail as she gets closer to the truth. Despite all this, Sookie learns another secret about her former lover Bill.I honestly had a hard time reading this and I had to really push myself to the end. I'm not enjoying the new character, Quinn, who seems to be more trouble for Sookie. The premise about Hadley's death was interesting, but fizzled out before the conclusion. The fairy-godmother, Claudine, is starting to get annoying, unlike the pervious novels. It was nice to see the Vampire Queen again, and I look forward to see how Sookie is going to assist her in the seventh book, All Together Dead. Definitely Dead is definitely not my favorite in the series, I actually found it boring.

I grew up watching The Real Ghostbusters when it aired on Saturday Mornings (yep, network television actually aired cartoons in the mornings back then). I could never afford the expensive complete series, so I have waited for the volumes to be released. The episodes in volume 3 is when the producers changed some of the voice cast and focused the episodes to be more kid friendly. I know that some fans didn't care for the change, but it didn't bother me much as I still enjoyed all the episodes. I only wish that more volumes will be released.The episodes on Volume 3 are:Disc 1:062-"Deadcon 1"063-"The Cabinet of Calamari"064-"A Ghost Grows in Brooklyn"065-"The Revenge of Murray the Mantis"066-"Rollerghoster"067-"I Am The City"068-"Moaning Stones"Disc 2:069-"The Long, Long, Long Etc.

When I was a kid I didn't care for the third installment of the TMNT series, but my parents love it. Now as an adult, the movie has grown on me. Since they killed Shredder off in the second film, the producers decided to send the four turtles andApril back in time to ancient Japan, where the turtles help a small village against and evil army. Plus, Casey Jones is back!It's not the best in the series, but I have grown to like it.

After finishing Dead to the World and watching the current season of True Blood, I realize that I an addicted to Sookie Stackhouse mysteries and was eager to jump into the next installment, Dead as a Doornail, picking up the previous plotlines. Sookie's bother, Jason, is now a werepanther, by force, and joins the other werepanther Hotshots. As Jason learns to be a panther, Sookie's boss, Sam, is shot by a mysterious sniper. But Sam isn't the only victim, there are others and they are all shape-shifters. This has Sookie fearing for Jason's life.Now for a twist, Sam asks Sookie for a favor - for her to ask the vampire Eric if Sam could borrow one of his vampire bartenders. Eric can never say no to Sookie, therefore the vampire pirate Charles joins Merlotte's in Sam's absence. Meanwhile, Tara is now in the control of the dangerous vampire Mickey.Dead as a Doornail focuses more on the weres and shape-shifters than it does vampires. If you are watching the current season, you'll realize that some of the plot elements in Dead as a Doornail are in it, mainly with Jason. Vampire favorites Bill, Eric and Pam have very little to do with the novel, and involves more of the Hotshots and werewolf clans. The death of Debbie Pelt is coming back to bite Sookie in the you-know-what, as private investigators are looking into her disappearance. I liked that the author laid out more of the werewolf mythology into the modern world. Sookie's fairy-godmother, Claudine, is a riot and fun character unlike the fairy plot from True Blood. The fifth book in the series is great read.

I'm surprised to find that Lionsgate released the unrated version of Bloody Diner instead of the R version.The movies on this two discs set are:Disc 1:Bloody Diner (Unrated;1987; 88 minutes)Earth Girls Are Easy (PG; 1988; 99 minutes)Boy Eats Girl (R; 2005; 80 minutes)Disc 2:Parents (R; 1989; 81 minutes)Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat (R; 1990; 104 minutes)Fido (R; 2006; 92 minutes)

I was a big fan of the cartoon series, which my parents disliked with a passion, but I persuaded them to take me to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie at the theater back in 1990 (Writing this makes me feel old! lol!). Surprisingly, my parents liked the movie and its two sequels.The 1990 movie is the closest that resembles the comics, except for the part of April being a reporter. The costumes done by the Jim Henson Company are better looking than most CGI special effects that are used in most movies today. This was my first true introduction of Casey Jones, who was hardly used in the animated series (I'm not counting the 2003 series). The only thing I disliked was Shredder's costume as it looked to fake. The producers should have gave the designers a little bit more money for it.Overall, it is still one of my favorite movies from my childhood.

check out "Kelly's Chance" at my local library. I have read several books by Wanda Brunstetter but mostly Amish books. This books is short at just over two-hundred pages. The story is et around the Leigh Canal during the late 1800s. A young woman named Kelly McGregor is helping her family by driving her father's mules as they pull the loads of coal to the city. There is no love in her parents' marriage, and she is determined never to get married.Kelly is saving her money so she can make her dream of becoming an artist come true. A shopkeeper, Mike Cooper, has a crush on Kelly. He offers to hang up some of her drawings in his store. The story gets a little predictable here, as of course, Kelly starts to have feelings for Mike.Despite the clich&eacute; formula that most Christian romance writers use, "Kelly's Chance" is a sweet, likeable tale.

I've heard of The Boondock Saints, but I have never seen it before until I watched it tonight. I bought it for five dollars at Walmart along with the sequel (also five dollars). I only noticed it because I saw the The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus was on the cover. I didn't know what to expect from it, but I ended up loving it.

Belinda, Frank and Hildy went joyriding on the night of April 1st. Frank flickered the headlights on and off for fun, or so they thought. They caused a terrible car accident that night. The other car blew up, so there was no hope of survival. Belinda and her friends left the scene of the crime. Two weeks go by, and Belinda no has a guilty conscience. Her friends tell her to just forget about it and get on with your life.She is hired by Mrs. Thorne to tutor her stepson, eighteen-year-old Adam, who is recovering from a terrible illness or was it an accident. He doesn't want anyone to see his face because of the burns. Adam is still grieving the fact that his father is in the hospital and is not suppose to survive much longer.Belinda has trouble tutoring Adam, as he doesn't want any help. Then, to make matters worse, strange things start happening. She receives a bloody doll's head and a car nearly runs her over. Are these just pranks? Or did someone see Belinda and her friends on April Fools night?Riche Tankersley Cusick wrote several of the books from the Point Horror era and a few Buffy the Vampire Slayer tie-ins. I had my doubts about the book after I finished reading the Prologue. The plot of Belinda and her friends driving carelessly and leaving the scene of the accident is somewhat of a clich&eacute; in the YA thriller/horror books. As the story progresses, April Fools became a different story, concentrating on Belinda's tutoring jog and the strange events that surround her. Most of the book takes place two weeks after April 1st, which is kind of misleading. The story would have been more convincing if there was a year difference between the prologue and the rest of the story, instead of two weeks. I still found the book enjoyable and fast to read. You'll quickly turn the pages to find out who is behind the pranks. This is a great book to read around April Fools Day.

Howling II - Your Sister Is a Werewolfhas little to do with the first film. We watch Karen's funeral at the beginning of the movie and her brother Ben becomes the main character, besides Christopher Lee's as a werewolf hunter. Lee's character convinces Ben to travel with him to Transylvania to kill the werewolf queen Stirba. As for the rest of the plot, I, like most viewers, couldn't follow it.This is one of the worst sequels ever made! Christopher Lee's talents are wasted. On a plus side, we do get several werewolves throughout the movie, but not enough to make me forget about the badly written script.

The Hunt For the BTK Killer is based on the book Nightmare in Wichita: The Hunt for the BTK Strangler, which is also based on the real serial killer. The movie first aired in 2005 on CBS, but it later made its way to DVD. Between the years 1974 and 1991, Dennis Rader murdered ten people in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Gregg Henry plays the serial killer and he does a great job playing the psychopath.I'm aware of the case as I live in Missouri and Rader's capture in 2005 was all over the news. Despite being made-for-television, The Hunt for the BTK Killer is a well made film with decent acting.

I'm not really into playing Star Wars games, but I absolutely loved playing Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga (Jewel Case). While the storyline campaigns can be fun, I liked the build-your-own campaign where you can choose from many locations and pick what group (Jedi, Rebels, Empire, Droids, Wookie and many others) that you want to be. You can spend countless hours building your fortress and increasing your army.

After a heavy advertising campaign, NBC aired the reboot of the 1966-1971 Dark Shadows soap opera in January 1991, but only this time it was aired in primetime instead of daytime. The series followed the basic plot of the original with Victoria Winters (played by Joanna Going) traveling on a train to Collinsport where she has taken a job as governess at the Collinwoods. She's really there to take care of David (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who claims to see ghosts at the "old house." While this is happening, Willie Loomis breaks into a crypt looking for jewels, but instead he releases the vampire cursed Barnabas Collins (played by Ben Cross).Barnabas makes Willie is servant. Then he quickly introduces himself to the Collins as a cousin from England, in which the family gives him the "old house." When Barnabas sees Victoria, he wonders if she is the reincarnation of his lost love Josette Du Pres. This here is a major change as in the original Maggie Evans was the look-alike for Josette. Barnabas peruses a relationship with Victoria.Barnabas is a vampire, so he does feed on the locals, which results in Dr. Julia Hoffman (played by Barbara Steele) learning of his blood sucking ways. She claims that she can cure him and mysteriously falls in love him.During a s&eacute;ance, Victoria Winters is sent back in time to the year 1790, where she poses at the governess. She meets the Barnabas before he was cursed, her double Josette, and the witch Angelique (played by Lysette Anthony). Before long, the Collins suspects that Victoria is a witch and they plan to hang her.The movie length pilot did well in ratings in 1991, but because of the first Gulf War coverage, the series got preempted and the ratings dropped. Thanks to the cult following, MGM released the series on DVD a few years ago. All thirteen episodes are available on the three DVD set.I remember the constant advertisements for the series when I was a kid. My parents let stay up to watch the two hour premiere. If I remember correctly, the episodes were shoved around because of the Gulf War. The series never really had a chance because of this. It's great that fans can get a chance to see the series in full, even though the last episode ended in somewhat of a cliffhanger. There are some problems/errors with the DVD. When the show was original filmed, they filmed some night scenes during the day and they would later alter the scenes during post-production. When MGM remastered the series for DVD, this was not taking into consideration; therefore we get a vampire walking in daylight.All the new actors fit perfectly into their roles, all accept for Jim Fyfe who played Willie Loomis, whose been altered to be a half-wit. I can't blame the actor as I'm sure he did his best. I blame the writers and producers for changing the character.Dark Shadows: The Revival isn't perfect, but it is a fun watch, and the DVD should satisfy most fans.

Overall, I liked the movie. I thought it was much better made than the campy overrated Twilight movies. But I did have a few issues with the film. I was hopping the beginning would have more scenes involving Katniss with her mother and sister. Why did they change the way she received the mockingjay pin? Where was the district 12 mayor and his daughter (I can't remember her name.)?The training and pre-events were too long.. I read several reviews of the movie before I watched it and they all talked about the graphic violence. In my opinion the violence was toned down compared to the book, probably to get a PG-13 rating. In the book, didn't Katniss shoot Marvel in the neck and not the stomach? Didn't Rue's district send Katniss a loaf of bread? What was up with the hound-like creatures? In the book the hounds resembled the fallen Tributes. Does anyone recall the soundtrack that was released in March with Taylor Swift, The Civil Wars, and others? Besides from a few songs during the ending credits, the others were missing in action.Like I said, I liked the movie. It was better made than what I expected it to be.

I would have to say Abraham Lincoln has always been my favorite president. As a kid, I read books about him, and I did an oral report on Abe for my 6th grade history class, where we got to dress up like someone historically famous. Years later, I learned through genealogy that Abe is a distant cousin. Now it looks like Hollywood has become interested in him, again, with the upcoming horror flick Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, and Steven Spielberg's bio Lincoln. In addition, The ASYLUM has released their own horror flick titled Abraham Lincoln VS Zombies, in which they have nicely sent me a complimentary DVD for this review.It seems like zombie tales have been done to death since the success of The Walking Dead, but as I am a zombie and an Abe fan, I was intrigue by the title. The prologue shows that a young Abe had to kill his mother, after she was an infected with a zombie virus, with a sickle. (What a horrible thing to experience at a young age.) Years go by and Abe is now President of the Untied States during the great American Civil War.Abe gets word that there are fallen soldiers returning from the dead at a fort, and having been in a zombie situation before, he immediately take action in fear of a major infestation among the American citizens. Our President is responsible in protecting us from all dangers, even the undead. Thus, Abe puts together a team of his best soldiers, the Secret Service. They find a few survivors including a prostitute whom Abe had a previous relationship with, besides from a few conversations there is not much of a romance here, but one would have to remember that Abe was a loyal married man.With his Secret Service at his side, a few prostitutes, a handful of soldiers (Union and Confederate), and a young boy, Abe takes on the zombie infested fort, mostly by beheading them. Let's just say this is a low-budget movie, with no CGI zombies (except for some head flying scenes) or expensive make-up effects, therefore what we get here is a Night of the Living Dead style zombies - pale makeup, a few blood spots, zombie grunting and slow walking.For history buffs, you will be extremely disappointed as there are several history errors, but this is a zombie movie and we are here to watch zombies. One error that did bother me was the mentioned of the men being the Secret Service, which makes no sense as the legislation for creating the agency was on Abe's desk the night he was assassinated. The Secret Service Division was only used to investigate counterfeiting crimes until 1901 when they were assigned to protect the President.The acting throughout the film is mediocre with mostly unknowns, except for Bill Oberst Jr. who plays Abe. At first glance at him in a top hat, I laughed as I thought he looked nothing like Abe, but after he began talking, I actually believed I was watching our sixteenth President. The actor obviously did a lot of research for the role and impressively took on Abe's spirit, but at the same time adding something new to the character. He stays in character for the entire movie, even during the action scenes where he beheads dozens of zombies with his neat, but deadly sickle.Abraham Lincoln VS. Zombies is never going to win an Oscar with its thin plot and cheap effects, but as a zombie movie lover, I had fun watching it. ASYLUM did extremely well by casting Bill Oberst Jr. as Abe, and the director Richard Schenkman did the best he could on a low budget. The result is that we get a decent old-school zombie flick that any zombie fan should enjoy.

Garfield teaches the animals his way of living.The Pet Show - Garfield gets reject from a pet contest because he is too fat, so he enters Odie into the contest. Garfield wants Odie to beat Nermal and win the grand prize - lasagna!Bone Diggers - Odie finds a rare brachiosaurus bone in the back yard. Garfield tries to sell the bone to a museum, and the museum owner, Mrs. Brubaker, plans on tearing down Jon's house to find more bones.Underwater World - Jon takes Garfield and Odie on a fishing trip. The cat and dog fall into the water where they encounter talking fish.Fish to Fry - Jon is babysitting Liz's pet fish, but all Garfield sees is lunch.History of Dogs - Garfield tells his viewers his version about the history of dogs, which is mostly negative.I grew up watching Garfield & Friends and the CBS specials, so naturally I had to buy this DVD. I wish the producers would release a full season set, but until that time comes (if it ever does) us fans have can enjoy this six episodes DVD release. The shows are cute enough for kids to like and funny enough to entertain adults.

I caught a few minutes of the second part of The Witches of Oz on an Encore channel the other day, where I saw a taxi floating in the air inside of a bubble while the wicked witch and her monkeys are causing chaos in the streets of New York. The scene caught my interest, but I had to leave at the time and the movie wasn't going to be on again. Luckily, I happened to stumble upon it for under ten dollars and of course I had to buy it. Little did I know that the movie was 164 minutes! After a little googling, I found out it was original intended as a mini-series, but ended up being cut down to 100 minutes with 15 minutes of new special effects added and released to a limited (very limited) run in theaters earlier this year. Why in the world would they send the longer version to DVD and to Encore?The Witches of Oz is set in our time and involves twenty-something Dorothy Gale getting a publishing contract for her OZ children stories; therefore she leaves her family farm and heads to New York. As strange situations occur, Dorothy's memory slowly returns and so do the evil Wicked Witch and her followers (Princess Langwidere, Nome King, an army of Winked Monkeys and a powerful dragon.). Soon Dorothy's friends from Oz return too, including Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, Frick & Frack, the good witches, and Oz himself, as they try to help her defeat the wicked witch once and for all.The plot sounds interesting and with such talented actors as Billy Boyd, Jeffery Combs, Sean Austin, Ethan Embry, Mia Sara, Lance Henriksen and Christopher Lloyd, one would think this movie had a chance of being good. But after watching nearly three hours I was left with mixed feelings and some confusion. At times the movie would go dark more toward an adult theme, and then suddenly, with horrible dialogue, it would change into a campy kid's movie. The actors tried to do their best with a confusing script, all except Dorothy played by Paulie Rojas who couldn't act and was widely miscasted. The special effects were your typical low-budget, but I could see the director Leigh Scott tried to do his best with what little he had to work with.Younger kids will probably enjoy watching this new take, and somewhat of a sequel, to The Wizard of Oz, but most adults might find it painful to watch. The movie is not completely awful, there are moments, here and there, that are intriguing. In my opinion the Wicked Witch was the best part, and I liked the makeup that they used on her, I even liked the eye patch. The Witches of Oz is not a great movie, as I have seen far worse like the Syfy's Tin Man that aired a few years ago. It's a forgettable fluff, with cheesy 80's special effects, dreadful dialogue, but with a few scenes of imagination.

Adopting Terror aired on Lifetime earlier this year, in which I didn't watch it because I don't care for most of the channel's programming. The movie was made by Asylum Home Entertainment, whom I have reviewed a few DVDs for this year, and they nicely let me view an online screening of Adopting Terror through Fordela.The movie stars Sean Astin and Samaire Armstrong as Tim and Cheryl Broadbent, who are proud parents of their newly adopted daughter, Mona. Just when they are adjusting to being a family, a stranger shows up at Mona's first birthday party. The stranger is Mona's birthfather, Kevin Anderson (played by Brendan Fehr), who was released from prison on a technicality.Kevin follows Cheryl while she is grocery shopping, he shows up at their house, and he even shows up at their friend's home to mow the yard. The police can't help them as there is no real proof that he is stalking them. The social worker, Fay Hopkins (played Monet Mazur), tries to give them advice on the situation, but nothing seems to helps as Kevin is determined to take back his daughter.Desperate to protect his family Tim buys a gun despite Cheryl's objections, and he may have to use it as Kevin is not the only person who wants to take Mona away from them.I can see why Adopting Terror first premiered on Lifetime before hitting DVD as it has the typical "inspired by true events" plot that most of the channel's movies are about, but the movie is slightly more intense than most. Typically Asylum's plots involve ghosts, zombies, disasters, sharks, or mockbusters, so I was surprised that the studio would release a melodrama thriller with actors that I have actually heard of. The movie started off slow for me, but the realistic plot kept me interested. There are a couple of twists that occur in the later half. I kind of saw the twist involving the social worker coming, but I didn't know if the writers would go that way or not. Despite a decent cast, the acting was average at best. There are of course a few plot holes that were probably caused by a rushed script. Like, why did the parents keep postponing the court date? And I guess the writers didn't know what a baby thermometer is. I'm still wondering how Kevin got out of the trunk of a car alive! Adopting Terror is not going to win any awards, but it is not as bad as you may think.

I can't believe I saw this movie eighteen years ago when I was in junior high. I owned the VHS version, but it went bad several years ago. Every year I look for DVD version, but I only find the trilogy collection, which I don't need since I already own 2 and 3. Tonight, I finally found The Santa Clause DVD at my local Walmart for under ten dollars.The movie is just as funny and heartwarming as I remembered.Features included on the Special Edition are:Special Features: So You Wanna Be An Elf?, Santa's Helper - A Trivia Adventure Game, Making Santa Snacks with WolfgangDVD-ROM Features: Write a Letter to Santa Feature, Christmas Countdown Calendar Screensaver

I grew up on the original Fear Street and Goosebumps books. I've also been collecting the Goosebumps DVDs over the years, so naturally I bought R.L. Stine's Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It when it first came out in 2007. It is loosely based on The Haunting Hour anthology by R.L. Stine.A goth teenager Cassie (played by Emily Osment)is having a hard time fitting into her new school, so she plays pranks on her fellow students and even on her younger brother, Max. She stumbles upon a strange Halloween store owned by a even stranger man (played by Saw's Tobin Bell). She finds an old book called The Evil Thing.She read the book to her brother before he went to bed, even thought the book has a warning - "Do Not Read Aloud." A creature from the beyond causes chaos on Halloween Night and Max goes missing. It is up Cassie along with a few new friends to stop the creature and save her brother.I was surprised that the movie was actually scary, despite some low-budget creature effects toward the end of the movie. The acting was decent, especially from Tobin Bell who's voice set the mood for the creepy story. This is a great movie to watch with your family around Halloween.

Fox released these four episodes to DVD back in 2004, in which I received as a birthday gift one year. The episodes are the best, but they are still funny. I see that the DVD gets a lot of negative reviews, which I don't know why. Yes, I would rather have a complete season, which I do own a few, but I'm mostly happy the DVD.Homer's Night Out - Bart snaps a naughty picture of Homer at a strip club.The Mansion Family - Mr. Burns goes to a clinic and leaves the Simpsons to take care of his mansion.Sunday, Cruddy Sunday - Homer and Bart lead a group of football fans to the Super Bowl.Homer the Moe - Home takes over the bar when Moe goes back to bartending school.

Cartoons older than 1953 were filmed in different aspects as to when they are put into widescreen, it will look a little odd. That is why Warner Bros used the fake widescreen matting. It is as simple as that. I have the majority of the shorts on other Looney Tunes releases, but they have a better video quality on this single disc than on the previous releases. The shorts, like Daffy's Inn Trouble, have been restored to their original versions with nothing edited out. This isn't the best Looney Tunes release, but it is not as bad as what other reviewers have said.The 15 shorts are:Tick Tock TuckeredNasty QuacksDaffy DillyWise QuackersThe Prize PestDesign for LeavingStork NakedThis is a Life?Dime to RetireDuck the DevilPeople Are BunnyPerson to BunnyDaffy's Inn TroubleThe Iceman DuckethSuppressed Duck

I stumbled upon Dark Shadows: The Best of Barnabas part of The Greatest Episodes Collection at my local Wal-Mart for under ten dollars. Dark Shadows aired from 1966 to 1971 normally in the late afternoons. At the time of it's peek Dark Shadows had around twenty million viewers, which is an incredible number compared to the low ratings of today's soap operas (Sadly, there are only four on the air.). And it was known for having errors, such as actors forgetting their lines; stagehands walking in the background; microphones where in the frame shot; etc, because of the tight filming schedule demanded by ABC.There have been dozens of Dark Shadows sets released over the years. The complete series is coming out this summer but at a whopping $599.98 retail price tag. The show has become more popular due to Tim Burton's remake starring Johnny Depp being released on Friday, resulting in MPI Home Video releasing The Best of Barnabas to DVD.The episodes are:Episode 221 - May 2, 1967Episode 349 - October 26, 1967Episode 418 - January 31, 1968Episode 535 - July 12, 1968Episode 703 - March 5, 1969Episode 718 - March 26, 1969Episode 915 - December 29, 1969Episode 982 - March 31, 1970Episode 1133 - October 29, 1970Each episode has an optional introduction by Lara Parker, who played Angelique, but the intros for episodes 703 and 718 are missing, instead the intro for 535 is repeated. The resolution on the episodes is not the best, which may have been caused by the cameras they used during production.Obviously the remake is going to bring some new fans into the Dark Shadow world, which makes this DVD an affordable introduction to the soap opera. Some episode highlights are when Julia's cure backfired aging Barnabas; Barnabas goes back to 1795; Barnabas introduces himself to the Collins family of 1897; and we get a glimpse of the parallel time arch. My favorite out of this DVD is the black-and-white episode 221 where Barnabas introduces himself to Maggie Evans at the Collinsport Inn.Dark Shadows: The Best of Barnabas is one of two recently released DVDs, and I'm sure there are going to more. I wish MPI would bring out story arches instead of random episodes. Despite a few flaws, the DVD is a great way to introduce Dark Shadows to new fans.

I'm not a musical fan, but I watched Buffy the Vampire, Angel and Firefly, so I thought I would give Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog a try. The three-part web miniseries (running a total of 42 minutes) aired in 2008 and was released onto DVD in December 2008.The plot centers on an inspiring supervillain named Billy (AKA Dr. Horrible - played by Neil Patrick Harris) who has been invited to join the Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil, but he must do something evil to get in. He plans on finishing his freezing gun, but first he needs to steel some wonderflonium.While attempting to steal the wonderflonium, his archenemy Captain Hammer (played by Nathan Fillion) interferes, but even worse Captain Hammer makes a move on the girl, Penny (Felicia Day), that he has a crush on.As Penny begins a relationship with Captain Hammer, Billy comes up with a plan to get into the Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil.Dr. Horrible will kill Captain Hammer.I absoultely enjoyed watching every minute of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Joss shows that you don't need a big budget; all you need is a well written script with great actors.

The Hard Corps (2006) has Van Damme playing an ex special force solider, Phillip Sauvage, who is hired as a bodyguard to the former World Heavyweight boxing champion, Wayne Barclay. Years before, Wayne had helped the rap mogul Terrell Singletery get sent to prison, but now the rapper is out and he wants revenge.The Hard Corps is another Van Damme film that I have never heard of before and is less action-packed and more of a thug drama. Besides from Van Damme and Vivica A. Fox, the acting is not great and neither is the direction of the film. The plot is interesting and the action scenes, the few that there are, are entertaining.

Being a Simpsons fan I had to own this game, which I bought for twenty dollars a few years ago at Walmart. I'm glad that they kept it in the same style as the series. My favorite part is when Bart and Homer battle the Lard Lad statue. The game isn't to difficult to play, but it can become addicting. This is the best out of the few Simpsons games that have been made.

Second in Command was released straight to DVD in 2006. The film is set in the Eastern European nation of Moldavia which is in the middle of a civil war. The United States government had help the country set up their own government which is lead by the newly-elected president Yuri Amirev. Communist insurgents, who are dedicated to the former dictator Alexei Kirilov and are lead by Tavarov, start a riot and they plan on taking back the country. Navy Seal Commander Sam Kennan (played by Van Damme) is temporary promoted to deputy ambassador and is assigned to protect Amirev. Chaos erupts and fifty Americans are taken hostage, leaving Kennan as the only one that can stop them.I've never even heard of this movie until watching it on DVD. The European civil war plot is believable, but some of the political jargon is incorrect. I ignored the plot holes and shaky camera work. The majority of the acting is decent for a direct-to-DVD film and there is a plenty of realistic action to satisfy most of Van Damme fans.

I had a blast watching these nine episodes, which are better pick than the unevenDark Shadows: Best of Barnabas. There is a werewolf, ghosts, a witch, demon possession, time travel and a parallel timeline in this collection. The first three episodes are my favorites, where Barnabas introduces himself as a cousin to the Collins family; during a freaky s&eacute;ance Victoria Winters travels back to the year 1795; and the witch Angelique tries to hurt Barnabas. The video resolution is better than the previous collection. Make sure to look for a few Dark Shadows famous bloopers/mistakes, as the actors flub their lines and you can clearly see the microphone boom shadow in several scenes. The Fan Favorites DVD should satisfy most Dark Shadows fans and introduce the series to a new generation.

There are rumors that the Tasmanian Tiger has been sighted on the Australian island of Tasmania. Nina, an Irish zoologist, believes that the mysterious tiger still exist. Her sister had came to the island looking for it. She had sent Nina a picture shortly before going missing. That was eight years ago and Nina and her group of friends go to the island to find the tiger, but then end up finding a group of cannibals.The first thirty minutes of the movie has slow pacing and I almost fell asleep because of it. Things start to get interesting when the Nina spots something outside in the bushes, then the blood and gore starts. Dying Breed reminds of the Wrong Turn movies, but only set in Australia. The acting is decent, but the plot is somewhat cliched. It's not the best horror movie, but it is better than some.

This 1983 film is based on the short stories by Jean Shepherd (who also does the film's narration) and is played for twenty-fours straight on TBS around Christmastime. I've seen the movie probably a half dozen times before I found out that my parents had never seen the movie before. I bought it on DVD several years ago and made them watch it. My dad didn't care for it, but mom thought it was funny. I think every kid can related to what Ralphie went through just to get that perfect gift that he dreamed of.

The Timeless Family Classics contains fifty movies on twelve discs with some of the most famous actors of all time, including Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, Charlie Chaplin, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Carole Lombard, Laurel & Hardy, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, and many other talented actors/actresses.I have never heard of the majority of these film, but I have enjoyed all them that I have watched so far. My Dear Secretary (1949) stars a young Kirk Douglas, Laraine Day, and Keenan Wynn. Douglas plays a best-selling novelist who hires a new beautiful secretary, who is also a fan of his. Before long the woman realizes that the novelist is nothing more than a womanizer and gambler, and she quits! He eventually goes after her and the two get married. Now there is a problem, she is also writing a novel that the publishers are interested in, but his newest novel isn't liked by anyone. The movie is hilarious, but romantic at the same time.Wacky Taxi (1972) stars John Astin, Frank Sinatra Jr., and Jackie Gayle. In this comedy drama, John Astin is tired of his dead end job. He quits his job and buys an old Cadillac that he transforms (barely) into a taxi. He doesn't have a license to drive a taxi or to run his own business, but his family needs to the money, so he becomes a taxi driver. That is until the car is stolen. The movie is more of a drama than comedy, but John Astin gives a great performance as a hard working family man.Beyond Tomorrow (1940) is a Christmas film that I have never heard of before, starring Harry Carey, Charles Winninger, Richard Carlson, and Maria Ouspenkaya. On Christmas Eve, three lonely and wealthy old men set up a young man and woman, who fall in love that night. The men leave and aboard a plane, but the plane crashes, killing the three men. The old men returns as ghost to find out that the young couple are about to break up. Before they can go to heaven, they must help this young couple. This is a cute Christmas movie that should be watched yearly around the holidays.My favorite out of this set is titled Lost Honeymoon (1947) starring Franchot Tone, Anne Richards, and Tom Conway. It is about an ex-solider who is now an architect. His life is going well as he is engaged to a lovely and wealthy woman, until an English woman shows up claming to be his bride and mother of his children. It seems he had lost his memory while he was in the war and he doesn't remember marrying or fathering any children. The woman isn't really his wife or the mother of his kids. His real wife and mother had died, and this woman took her identity, so she could reunite the children with their father, but the woman is falling in love with him. This is a well written, heartbreaking romantic tale!The other movies in this set are: Lost in the Stratosphere (1934); Freckles Comes Home (1942); The Big Chance (1933); The Iron Mask (1929; silent); Treasure of Fear (1945; That's My Baby! (1944); The Gang's All Here (1941); The Borrowers (1973); The General (1927; silent); Kid Dynamite (1943); Let's Get Tough! (1942); Swing It, Sailor! (1938); The Admiral Was a Lady (1950); A Bride for Henry (1937); Jane Eyre (1934); Run to the High Country (1974); Flying Wild (1941); The Big Trees (1952); The Medicine Man (1930); Oliver Twist (1933); Hay Foot (1942); The Little Princess (1939); Bill Cracks Down (1937); The Flying Deuces (1939); Mr. Boggs Steps Out (1938); The Inspector General (1949); The Kid (1921; silent); The Groom Wore Spurs (1951); Heading for Heavens (1947); The Hurricane Express (1932); A Farewell to Arms (1932); Gulliver's Travels (1939; animated); The Nut Farm (1935); My Favorite Brunette (1947); Fair Play (1972); Against a Crooked Sky (1975); The Racketeer (1929); Goodbye Love (1933); Adventure Island (1947); Lay That Rifle Down (1955); A Star is Born (1937); Uncle Joe (1941); Boys of the City (1940); The Lost World (1925; silent); The Time of Your Life (1948); Our Town (1940).I had a lot of fun watching some of these timeless classics. Mill Creek Entertainment has put together a great collection of films for your entire family to enjoy. None of the movies have been digital remastered, but all of the movies that I watched seemed to have a decent picture quality to them. With Christmas only a few months away, this collection would make a great gift!Disclaimer - I received a free review copy from Tower PR in exchange for an honest review.

This is not a bad two discs set for the price.Here we get:Bride of Re-Animator (R, 1990, 96 minutes)Beyond Re-Animator (R, 2003, 95 minutes)Return of the Living Dead 3 (R, 1993, 97 minutes)Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis (R, 2005, 88 minutes)Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave (R, 2005, 86 minutes)Night of the Living Dead 2D (R, 2006, 80 minutes)I'm a big Zombie fan and this collection has two great movies, one decent movie and three below-average flicks. Bride of Re-Animator is the best out of the six, but once again we get the R rated version and not the uncut version. The same goes for it's lackluster sequel, Beyond Re-Animator. The underrated Return of the Living Dead 3 is the Rated R version instead of the uncut version that had came out on VHS years ago. The other three zombie flicks are low-budget sequels/remakes that are times painful to watch. I would only recommend those three for die-hard fans of both series as you might want to add them to your collection.

Gingerdead Man is nothing to to brag about as the plot is not really original. It is a combination ofChild's Play,Jack Frost, and thePuppet Mastermovies.Years after a madman, Millard Findlemeyer (played by Gary Busey), killed her father and brother, Sarah struggles to get on with her life even days after Findlemeyer was executed. His ashes was sent to his mother (aka a witch) who mixes it with gingerbread spice. The spice happens to end up at the bakery that Sarah works at with her mother.Sarah makes one big gingerbread man from the mix and brings Findlemeyer back from the dead. Now one by one, Findlemeyer kills anyone in his path as he sets to get his revenge.There are no computer special effects in the movie. What we do get is a gingerbread puppet as the killer. Yes, it is laughable. I ended up actually liking for the movie for what it was - a horror comedy, but it is only an hour long, not counting the credits.

Hollow Man 2 was released direct-to-DVD six years after the original. The government has been experimenting with the invisibility serum by injecting it into a soldier, Michael Griffin (played by Christian Slater). Of course he goes a little mad, killing innocent people at random. His next target is Dr. Maggie Dalton, who may or may not have a cure for him. Hot on his trail is Detective Frank Turner, who is assigned to protect Maggie. The only way Turner can stop Griffin is to have the serum injected into himself.My expectations for Hollow Man 2 were low as I don't care much for direct-to-DVD sequels that don't need to be made. The movie isn't connected to any of the events or characters of the first film. Griffin is already invisible at the beginning of the movie and the back-story is briefly explained in flashbacks. There are several well-known actors in it, but the plot is clich&eacute;d and predictable. The special effects are average of at best. Overall, Hollow Man 2 is an okay sequel thanks to the twist with the second Hollow Man.

The Odd Life of Timothy Green is making its way onto DVD and Blu-ray on December 4th just in time for Christmas. I recall seeing a few advertisements for it when it was released to theaters, but I never got a chance to see it until I watched it on DVD last night. Disney was nice enough to send me an advanced copy in exchange for my honest review.At first I thought The Odd Life of Timothy Green was based on a book, but I was mistaken as it was based on the concept by Ahmet Zappa. It was written and directed by Peter Hedges (What's Eating Gilbert Grape).Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner star as Jim and Cindy Green, a couple living in the small drought-stricken town of Stanleyville, North Carolina. Jim spends his days working at the town's historic pencil factory while Cindy works at the local museum. The couple desperately wants to have children, but they find out they cannot conceive a child.Heartbroken, they write down their dream child's characteristics onto pieces of paper, put the pieces into a wooden box and buried it in their garden.Strangely, a thunderstorm occurs only on their property and they are awaken in the middle of the night by the appearance of a ten-year-old boy named Timothy covered in mud. After cleaning the mud off, Jim and Cindy discover the boy has leaves growing on his legs. Even more odd is that there is a now hole in their garden and the wooden box they buried has been crushed.The Greens takes the boy in and introduces Timothy to their family and friends as their adopted son. To their surprise, Timothy is not like other boys as he has a special gift that will forever change their lives.There are not many clean-cut family films anymore, but The Odd Life of Timothy Green is a heartfelt film that the entire family can watch together. By the few advertisements I saw on television, I already had a good idea what the premise was about. Most fantasies focuses on special effects, but The Odd Life of Timothy Green focuses on human emotion brought to life by a well written script and marvelous acting by the entire cast. Overall, I enjoyed watching every bit of the movie as it was a breath of fresh air. I recommend putting the movie on your Christmas wish list.

I grew up watching 80s horror and science fiction movies on basic cable. I was more than excited to order this 8 Movie Horror Collection distributed by Lionsgate. I have bought other DVDS that have six or more horror movies from other studios (most of them were in the five dollar bin at Walmart) and they would have below average picture quality. On this 2-disc set, there are four movies on each disc. One would think the picture quality would be weak, but it's actually pretty good.Disc One:976-EVIL 2 (1991; 93 minutes; Rated R)Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College (1991; 94 Minutes; Rated R)C.H.U.D. II: Bud the Chud (1989; 84 Minutes; Rated R)Waxwork (1988; 93 Minutes; Rated R)Disc Two:Slaughter High (1986; 92 Minutes; Unrated)Class of 1999 (1990; 96 Minutes; Unrated)Chopping Mall (1986; 77 Minutes; Rated R)The Unholy (1988; 102 Minutes; Rated R)I bought this set just so I could get Waxwork, which I haven't seen since I was a a kid.I've never seen Chopping Mall, which the plot has three robots terrorizing a small group inside a locked mall at night. The movie is campy, but a lot of fun. Plus, Barbara Crampton is in it!Ghoulies III is the third entry in the really low-budget series. This time the creatures are on a campus and terrorizes the students. It is as campy as it could get with the ghoulies actually speaking.C.H.U.D. II drops the horror aspects of the original and goes the spoof route with the last C.H.U.D. (aka Bud) getting in the hands of two students, who accidentally bring it back to life. I have great memories watching the first movie when I was a kid, but I never knew that there was a loose sequel. The movie isn't that bad as long as you don't take it seriously.976-EVIL 2 is a sequel nobody wanted. It's as bad as I expected it be. The only interesting scene is the woman steps into the It's a Wonderful Life/Night of the Living Dead.I had forgotten all about Slaughter High. Here we get the unrated version, which is about one-minute longer. The plot has been one to death which involves a bullied student getting revenge at a school reunion.The Class of 1999 is also the uncut version. I recall watching it a few times on cable as a kid. It's not the greatest movie, but it is fun to watch.The Unholy is the only film in the set that is actually scary. It involves a priest tracking down a demon who is killing anyone that sins.None of these movies are Oscar worthy, but I had a blast watching them.

The Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie sends the Russos on a family vacation to Hawaii. After a fight with her mother, Alex makes a wish that her parents never married. Alex and her brothers can't figure out how to break the spell, sending Alex and Justin on an adventure to find the Stone of Dreams before they are erased from reality forever.This isn't a prefect movie, but it is a great adaption of the TV series. I was disappointed that Harper didn't have a bigger part. Why couldn't they have invited her to come along?The Disney Channel's Original Movies have been declining in quality over the last few years. I wish they would make more movies that are aimed for kids and adults! I doubt if a sequel to Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie will ever be made, but we can always hope for one.

Jill and her family inherit Uncle Solly's house. He was a famous magician. There is one catch; the house is on Fear Street!At first, Jill loves the house, but then she starts seeing weird, nasty creatures. Are they poltergeists?The Ghost of Fear Street series was not written by R.L. Stine, but by ghostwriters. I do not know if he gave them the actual ideas for the books, or did the ghostwriter created it. House of a Thousand Screams is your typical haunted house tale, but with a clever twist at the end.

About ten years ago, I saw the first twenty minutes of The Funhouse on the Scifi (now SyFy) channel, but I had to leave and didn't catch the rest of the movie. So, I was thrilled to find the movie on DVD. I enjoyed the movie, even though it was a little silly, but it is still better than most recent horror movies.

Just in the time for the holidays is the release of the new hit series that aired on BBC in the UK and on PBS in the United States. I recall reading an article in the TV Guide a few months about the show, but I had forgotten it was being aired. Luckily, I got an opportunity to receive a free copy of Season One in exchange of an honest review courtesy of BBC Worldwide Americas.The series was created and written by Heidi Thomas (also created Upstairs Downstairs) and is based on the memoirs of the late Jennifer Worth. Set in the poverty-stricken East London in the 1950s, the series centers around a young Jenny Lee (played by Jessica Raine), who believes she is going to be working at a small hospital called Nonnatus House, but to her surprise, it is actually a convent. She quickly befriends the other nurses, Trixie and Cynthia, the handyman Fred, and the Sisters, Julienne, Evangelina, Bernadette and Monica Joan. Jenny is there mainly as a midwife, but she has other duties to attend to as well. Just like the other midwives, Jenny must ride a bicycle to visit her patients.The second episode introduces another supporting character, a tall woman named Chummy Browne, who shows up at the Nonnatus House wearing a pink uniform. She is an oddball character that doesn't quite fit in with the other nurses at first. She can't even ride a bicycle when she arrives, but she learns by the end of the episode.There are only six episodes in the first season, running about sixty minutes each, but each episode is extremely well written and the cast does a remarkable job with their parts. Vanessa Redgrave provides the narration for each episode as an older Jenny.I'm well aware of what a midwife does, but my first thought was that the series would be boring. To my surprise, Call the Midwife is anything but boring. I became instantly addicted to the show after the end of episode one. I had no idea what life was like back in 1950 as I'm only a 31-year-old, so I more than enjoyed the little details from the costumes to the streets of East London. I knew that times were tough back then, but I didn't know the poverty was that horrible. The main character Jenny is adorable, but Chummy steals every scene she is in. I absolutely fell in love with the show. I recommend Call the Midwife Season One to everyone.

Hostel starts out as a typical college vacation trip film, where Josh, Paxton, and their new friend &Oacute;li just want to have a good time. They get a tip that there are 'easy' beautiful women in Bratislava and of course they go. Things seem normal as they meet three women who seduce them, but they have no idea of what horrors await them.Hostel is not for the weak-hearted! It, along with the Saw movies, created what is known as the "torture porn" genre. The first half is more-or-less a raunchy comedy, but then after a few twists and turns, the mayhem begins. It is sick to think that there might be rich powerful people that want to torture and kill a person. The movie is well acted and the last thirty-minutes is intense, but it is also twisted.

Yes, it is still aired every year like A Charlie Brown Christmas, but it is still one of the best animated holiday specials. I have fond memories watching it as a child, but it has been cut down by several minutes by CBS so they can make a few extra bucks. I prefer to watch it on DVD at Christmastime.

Frosty is one of my favorite Christmas cartoons and is one of the few that is still aired today at Christmastime, typically back-to-back with the dreadful and unrelated Frosty Returns. Just like other older animated specials, Frosty the Snowman has lost several minutes over the years due to commercials. The DVD version is longer, but June Foray, who voiced Karen, has been edited and dubbed by someone else for some mysterious (probably due to copyright) reason.

Once again, I'm too cheap to buy the Golden Collections, so I settled for the Spotlight Collection 2. The cover can be a little misleading as some of the characters shown don't make an appearance. Not all of the shorts are restored and remastered either. Disc one is mostly of Tweety and Sylvester and disc two has mixed shorts. This isn't the prefect set, but for the price I am satisfied with the DVD.The 30 shorts are:Disc One:Bad Ol' Putty TatAll Abir-r-r-dRoom and BirdTweet Tweet TweetyGift WrappedAin't She TweetA Bird in a Guilty CageSnow BusinessTweetie PieKitty KorneredBaby BottleneckOld GloryThe Great Piggy Bank RobberyDuck Soup to NutsPorky in WakylandDisc Two:Back Alley OproarBook RevueA Corny ConcertoHave You Got Any Castles?Hollywood Steps OutI Love to SingaKatnip KollegeThe Help CatThe Three Little BopsOne Froggy EveningRhapsody RabbitShow Biz BugsStage Door CartoonWhat's Opera, Doc?You Ought to Be in Pictures

I'm a huge Simpsons fan, so I was excited about playing Hit & Run. In the game you can either play as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, or Apu. You get to go on missions driving different vehicles across Springfield, in which you get to crash into buildings and run over characters. The graphics are great, but once you have played one mission, you have played them all. The game gets boring quickly.

I would rush through my homework just so I could watch The Tiny Toon Adventures at 4:30 every weekday when I was a kid. The characters could be rude and crude, driving my mom crazy. It is one of my favorite cartoons! I eagerly awaited the DVD release from Warner Bros., in which I do love rewatching every episode, but the video quality could have been better, reminding me of VHS tapes. What is up with the fourth disc?

I'm not a big football fan, but I saw this at a local thrift store for only $2.50 and I had to buy it. The game has great graphics and you can play preseason and season games. You can even choose which team you want to be. I picked the Kansas City Chiefs as that is only way they are ever going to win a season.

I received the workout program by UPS within a week, packaged in a cardboard box with the RUSHFIT logo printed on it containing the five DVD workouts (Full Body Strength & Conditioning; Abdominal Strength & Core Conditioning; The Fight Conditioning Workout; Strength & Endurance Workout; and the Explosive Power Training), the bonus DVD workouts (Balance & Agility and Stretching For Flexibility), the cardboard box case, 3 workout programs (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced), the Nutrition Guide, and the Workout Guide.The RUSHFIT program was created especially for MMA (mixed martial arts) fighter George St-Pierre by his trainer Erik Owings. It's okay if you're not a MMA fighter or an athlete as the program is made for anyone who wants to get into shape by helping you burn fat and build muscle. The program lasts eight weeks which you can choose between the three different training calendars depending on your overall fitness level. There is an assessment video on the RUSHFIT website, and it is also featured on the bonus disc, to determine what level you should start with and help you track your results.The workouts start with a ten minute warm-up, followed by a thirty minute workout, and ends with a five minute cool down. Each workout consists of many air squats, burpees, and a few lunges. Five high intensity circuits are used in each workout. Dumbbells are used for several workouts, which you can use from 2 to 25 pounds depending on your strength. There are days on the schedule that just says "CARDIO", which means you can either jog, use a treadmill, cycle, or workout to another cardio DVD for at least thirty minutes for the weeks 1-4 at medium intensity and increase to forty minutes or more for weeks 5-8.The nutrition guide is a bare bone guide, giving you a list of what foods to eat or not to eat during the eight weeks. I was somewhat disappointed that there wasn't a calendar or healthy recipes in the guide.Despite my dislike for the nutrition guide, I was impressed with the RUSHFIT home exercise program. The workouts are 45 minutes, but the time flew by while I was exercising. The warm-up is the same on each DVD, which does get repetitive, but is needed to prevent injuries. Even though none of the workouts are considered cardio, I did end up covered in sweat by the end each workout. The instructor, Erik Owings, doesn't waste anytime or goof around and neither does George St-Pierre, who at times stumbles, proving that no one is perfect even if you are an athlete. Air squats may seem easy, but it does get challenging after thirty. I've never been a fan of burpees, but after the first week they become easier. RUSHFIT is more professionally put together than other workout programs on the market. While I have been using the program, I have noticed increased strength in my legs and back, and I have also lost seven pounds. Overall, I've more than enjoyed the results I have seen from the RUSHFIT program and I recommend it to others.Note: I received this product "free of charge" in exchange of my honest review.

I grew up reading the books, but I only saw a handful of episodes when they originally aired in the middle 1990s. I checked out several Goosebumps VHS at my local library several years ago, in which one of them was Welcome to Dead House. Yes, it has a low-budget and bad acting, but I still liked it for some odd reason. I later found the VHS at a local thrift store. I later found out that the episode was released on DVD back in 2004. Luckly, a few years ago, I found the DVD thrown into the five dollar bin at Walmart!Welcome to Dead House is a great addiction to my Goosebumps Collection.

The second entry in the American Pie Presents series introduces two more Stiflers. After getting a free weekend pass from his girlfriend, Erik Stifler, along with his two friends, head to college to visit his cousin, Dwight. Their mostly there to attend the famous Naked Mile, plus Erik hopes to lose his virginity.Just like the other American Pie films, there are few crude scenes, nudity, and language. Of course there is a cameo by Eugene Levy.I only paid a $1.96 for the movie at a Black Friday sale, so I'm mostly satisfied with my purchase. The movie is raunchy, but funny.

I was pestered to death by my parents to watch Once Upon a Time. Sure, I've seen the advertisements for it, but I never attempted to watch it because I never cared much for Jennifer Morrison when she was onHouse, M.D..I saw the complete first season at my local Walmart yesterday and I thought I would give it a try. If I don't like it, I can always give it to my parents.Inside the set was a $10 coupon off of any current and upcoming ABC series DVD/Blu-Ray Set, includingCastle: The Complete Fourth SeasonI intended to only watch the pilot last night, but I ended up watching the entire first disc as I became addicted to the mysterious town of Storybrooke.The Episodes on the set are:Disc 1:1.

There was no internet, cell phones, or cable TV during the 1930s and 1940s, so people would find entertainment by seeing picture shows, listening to the serials on the radio, and reading magazines. The magazine stands were full of pulp magazines with ragged edges, pulpwood paper, embellished covers, and cheap prices. Pulps contained countless adventure stories by real storytellers of the time, such as H.P. Lovecraft, Elmore Leonard, and Ray Bradbury. Stories from the Golden Age is releasing all of author L. Ron Hubbard's short stories from the 1930s and 1940s onto audiobooks. Galaxy Press nicely sent me the award winning audiobook, Trouble on His Wing, originally published in the January 1939 issue of Five-Novels Monthly.Trouble on His Wings is about a journalist (AKA a picture-chaser) named Johnny Brice, who will do anything to get the best story for World News. Along with his cameraman sidekick, Irish Donnegan, Johnny plans on getting the best newsreels of the cruise ship that caught on fire at sea. By time he arrives, the waters had claimed the cruise ship and the survivors were rescued. Johnny comes up with the bright idea of paying $5,000 for the pictures that the survivor took. It was great idea until Johnny risked his life saving a woman from the ocean. He has looses all footage from the shipwreck and gets stuck with a beautiful woman whom he names Jinx.After barely saving their jobs, Johnny and Irish head to their next assignments that take them to Idaho and across the seas to China. They take along Jinx because they don't know what else to do with her as they suspect that she is wanted by the police. Disaster after disaster occurs, ruining every camera shot, in which Johnny blames Jinx for everything. He wants to leave her behind, but he is falling in love for the golden-haired beauty.I had the honor of listening to a few other audiobooks from Stories from the Golden Age last year, so I eagerly agreed to review Trouble on His Wings courtesy of Galaxy Press in exchange for my honest review. I would have never thought an adventure about a cameraman would be entertaining, but I was hooked into Johnny Brice's adventures almost instantly. I didn't realize a cameraman would risk their own life to get the best pictures. The story is cleverly written and the voice cast is spot on, especially with Jennifer Aspen as Jinx. The sound effects for the ocean, planes, and forest fire enhances the story. I felt I was actually with them on the adventure. Trouble on His Wings is an intriguing tale with action, humor, and romance and it is now my favorite audiobook from Stories from the Golden Age. I highly recommend it to everyone.

I grew up watching the zany Tiny Toon Adventures. I bought the first two volumes when they were released to DVD, but Warner Bros. has been lazy in releasing the series. Back in August, they finally releasedTiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation. I love the series, but the picture quality hasn't been the best, more or less like a VHS recording. I do hope that Warner Bros. listens to the fans and releases a remastered Volume 3.According to the press release Volume 3 will have seventeen episodes on two discs.Disc 1:Episode 66 - Pledge Week (It's All Relatives; Lifeguard Lunacy; The Kite)Episode 67 - Going Places (When You're Hot; That's Art Folks; Slaughterhouse Jive)Episode 68 - Elephant Issues (Why Dizzy Can Read; C.L.I.D.E. and Prejudice; One Beer)Episode 69 - Hog-Wild HamtonEpisode 70 - Playtime Toons (Happy Birthday Hamton; Fit To Be Toyed: Strung Out Kitty)Episode 71 - Toon Physics (Once Upon a Star; A Cub for Grub; The Year Book Star)Episode 72 - Acme Cable TV (The Babsy and Buswinkle Show; Foot Loops; The Cat Who Thought He Was a Hammer Head Shark; Flassie; Story of Montana Max; Toonywoods Square; Grossanne; Bungle Boy Jeans; The Gogosby Show; Incredible Discoveries)Episode 73 - Buster and Babs Go HawaiianDisc 2:Episode 74 - Henny Youngman Day (Stand-Up and Deliver; The Potty Years; Lame Joke)Episode 75 - Love Disconnection (My Dinner with Elmyra - Part 1; My Dinner with Elmyra - Part 2; The Amazing Three)Episode 76 - Kon Ducki (The Voyage of the Kon Ducki; The Making of Kon Ducki)Episode 77 - Sepulveda BoulevardEpisode 78 - Take Elmyra PleaseEpisode 79 - ThirteensomethingEpisode 80 - New Class Day (The Just-Us League of Supertoons; Sound Off; A Night in Kokomo)Episode 81 - Fox Trot (My Brilliant Revenge; Can't Buy Me Love; Phone Call from the 405)Episode 82 - What Makes Toons Tick (Whirlwind Romance; Going Up; Nothing to Sneeze At)

Unplanned, and at the last minute, I hopped over to my local Walmart. For some odd reason I glanced at the fitness section and there staring back at me was Billy Blanks. Not the real one. LOL. He was on the front cover of what I thought was the new DVD, which actually it was a cardboard box containing the new Taebo Power DVD and a pair of adjustable weighted gloves. I had to laugh and inspected the box as I had just ordered a pair of Everlast weighted gloves from an Ebay seller the night before. I glanced at the price and it was under $17 which wasn't bad considering that one exercise DVD cost at least $9, but this had the gloves.Since I had skipped my workout that morning because I had take care of a few errands, I waited until late in the evening to pop the DVD into the player. For newcomers to Tae Bo, you'll be disappointed that there is no instructional workout. Normally, Billy Blanks takes fifteen minutes to explain the new moves. The main workout is longer than the other releases this year, this one rounding about 61 minutes counting the warm up and cool down. If your looking for a great cardio workout, you'll won't find it here. Power focus on mostly the upper body with a few kicks here and there. The weighted gloves does a make a difference, but you can don't have to use them. You can use handheld weights or none at all and you'll still feel the burn. The last fifteen minutes is a killer! There is a bonus workout called Billy's Power Abs! It is the short program around 10 minutes long, and involves sitting in a chair for the routines. I found this to be challenging as I don't have a sturdy metal chair like Billy and the gang does.Now, let's talk about the weighted gloves. I have never owned a pair before, and I've been searching for a pair since I started Tae Bo earlier in the year. Like I said above, I just ordered a pair the night before, which I, now, thought would be backups. I would say that they're no more than a pound each. The gloves fit perfectly, but they might be too big for someone with smaller hands. After I finished the workout and took off the gloves, I noticed that the black material had rubbed off onto my skin. This happened in my next two workouts and now I haven't had any problems. I received the Everlast gloves today in the mail. I haven't had a chance to test them out yet, so I won't be comparing the Tae Bo glove to them just yet.Overall, I must say Tae Bo is a fun workout that is meant to tone your upper body, and you will be sore the next day. There is a lot of punching throughout the workout, so be expected to be covered with sweat by the end of the DVD.

The illustrations are spooky helping the mystery plot thicken page by page. If you can find Last Look, read it.

I could never find this game until I stumbled upon it at my local dollar store for ten dollars. I have to say that From Russia with Love is the best James Bond game ever made and it has the original Bond himself, Sean Connery! The graphics, music and action are great! From Russia With Love is now my favorite PS2 game.

A Night in Terror Tower is one of my favorite books from the Goosebumps series by R.L. Stine and was adapted as a television episode in 1996 as an hour special that aired on Fox in primetime.Sue and her brother Eddie are on a tour of Terror Tower in London. They briefly time travel back to medieval times and return to present time. When the arrive back at their hotel, there is no record that their parents every checked in.This DVD also includes the two-part episodes Stay Out of the Basement in which Margaret and her little brother are worried about their father who is acting very odd. He spends all his free time in the basement working on his experiments with plants.I bought these episodes on VHS back in the 90s and it is nice to finally own them on DVD. Both kids and adults will enjoy watching these spooky episodes.

After becoming addictive to watching reruns on ABC Family and Soap.net, I stumbled upon the Gilmore Girls season one and two bundled together for under twenty dollars at a Target Store. After quickly going through the first season, a few days later I started watching the second season. A week went by and I had finished watching it. I realized that the series was aimed for a female audience, but for some reason it clicked with me, mostly because I caught Lorelai and Rory constantly drinking coffee, and I have always liked Lauren Graham ever since I saw her in Bad Santa.Season 2 picks up where the first season finale ended, with Lorelai finally saying "yes" to Max's marriage proposal and Rory starts up her relationship with Dean again. I found it odd that the first few episodes are set during the summer, as in most TV series the start of season takes place three months later, where the kids are going back to school. The first three episodes involve planning for the upcoming wedding, which never really happens as Lorelai calls it off. The following episode has Rory and her on a road trip to visit Harvard; well it was more like crashing and is my favorite episode now. Lorelai's love life is ignored through most of the season besides from a few scenes with Rory's father who ends up going nowhere. Rory's love life is the man focus as she is torn between her sweetheart Dean and Luke's troubled nephew Jess.Between the smart dialogue, quirky characters, and the coffee drinking, I absolutely love this show, and I regret never watching it during its original run. Luke (the owner of Luke's Diner) is the most relatable character for me. From his casual style, ruddiness/crankiness, and attitude, all in which reminds me of myself, except for his dislike of coffee. Or course I like Lorelai for her smart-ass attitude and Rory's love of books. What I didn't care for was the character Jess, who is just an annoying troublemaker. I was laughing out loud when Luke shoved Jess into the lake.

I stumbled upon this book at a thrift shop. I didn't even know that there was a book series out about the Universal Monsters that I grew up watching. Even though this is the third book, you can easily catch up as the characters Nina, Joe and Bob explain what happen in the previous book.While visiting Universal Studios Theme park, Nina, Joe and Bob accidentally release the monsters from the remastered Universal film when lighting struck. The monsters don't take the bodies form the movies, they take new ones. In book one, they battled Dracula and in book two the battled the Wolf Man.Dead bodies are going missing, and that can mean only one thing. Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant, Fritz, are up to their old tricks. They are going to build another monster. Just like in the movie, Fritz grabs the wrong brain, and the monster is once again - brain-dead.Dr. Frankenstein needs a new brain for his creation, and has eyes on the new student at Nina, Joes and Bob's school. Can the kids stop the mad scientist in time?I quickly read through this book. It was a fun read. I hope I can find the other books in the series. The author and Universal Studios came up with a great idea to bring in a new generation of monster fans. If you are a fan of the old monster movies, then, you'll love "Anatomy of Terror."

I was only a one-year-old when the Smurfs debuted, but I recall watching the later seasons and watching the others in reruns. The series was funny, smart and helped kids learn life lessons.

I saw the movie when it originally came out back in 2004, which is based on the non-lawyer novel by John Grisham. The movie centers on the Kranks (played by Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis), who decide to skip the holidays and take a trip instead. Yes, it is predictable, but it has its funny moments.

Footlight Glamor is the fourteenth movie in the film series and the second not to use "Blondie" in the title. Mr. Dithers is giving Dagwood a bonus for letting a friend's daughter, Vicky, stay at his house. Of course Dagwood thinks that this is a little girl and not a grown woman. Let's just say that Blondie is furious when she learns that Vicky isn't a child. Vicky is actually a singer/actress who is trying to get away from her boyfriend, Jerry Grant. Poor Vicky thinks Dagwood is a theater producer, when actually Dagwood was referring to the theater that Mr. Dithers is building.Blondie eventually becomes friends with Vicky and helps her put together a play called Mad Moonlight. Jerry Grant goes after Vicky, well after her money, but tells her that he will produce her show. Everything imaginable goes wrong in the play. By the night's end Vicky wants to marry Jerry, but Dagwood overhears it wrong and thinks that Blondie is leaving with Jerry.Footlight Glamor is another cute entry in the long running Blondie film series.

Smackdown VS Raw 2008 is a step down from 2007 even though it has the ECW brand in it. The problem with most wrestling games is that they are not challenging enough. A six-year-old can through it in an hour. There should be more storylines! Don't get me wrong, the game is fun to play, but it is very easy to play.

A few years ago I started recording a few episodes that aired in the mornings on WGN. Then I would watch them on the weekend. I became interested in the show because I was I was already of a fan of Law & Order SVU, and of course the character John Munch started on Homicide.Homicide is one of the best realistic police dramas every produced. Unlike the Law & Order franchise, the series showed the characters' private lives, which made the it even more likeable. I didn't care for how a few characters exited out of the show, but they all return, even the dead, in the Homicide: The Movie which is included in the complete series along with the Law & Order crossover episodes.

During the 1930s and 1940s, newsstands were overflowing with magazines, especially those made from cheap brown pulp paper, or otherwise known as Pulp magazines which featured popular authors such as Louis L'Amour, Robert E. Howard, Erle Stanley Gardner, and John D. MacDonald. In its hey-day pulp magazines had over thirty million avid readers each and every month. Pulp fiction authors only got paid one cent per word, forcing the majority of authors to write aggressively at times. They didn't write to impress critics, but instead they wrote for the readers, who devoured story after story and adventure after adventure.Author L. Ron Hubbard also wrote over 150 short stories during the golden age and now Galaxy Press is releasing the stories onto audiobooks with talented voice actors and dazzling sound effects. Galaxy Press nicely sent me a complimentary copy of the award-winning Man-Killers of the Air, which first appeared in the June 1935 issue of Five Novels Monthly.Smoke Burnham zooms in the sky in his mystery plane along with his flying companion, a pet cheetah named Patty. The crowd loves to watch him fly at the air shows, but Girard, a newspaper mogul that invested in Burnham, doesn't like him. Sure, he gives Girard great publicity, but Girard just wants the plans to his secret plane, which legally belongs to Smoke's girlfriend, the lovely Melanie King.Despite winning countless air races, Smoke is secretly broke. He can't even pay his publicist and friend, Alex. Seeing no other way to pay his debt, he agrees to participate in the International Air Derby. If he wins - Girard will rebuild his hanger and pay for a fleet of planes. If he loses - Girard will own the secret plane. There is one little problem, he doesn't have a plane because Melanie is the true owner and doesn't want to see him risk his life. After some quick thinking, Smoke acquires a mammoth sea plane, but he's not flying alone as he takes Patty, Melanie and Alex with him across the dangerous horizons.I guess you can say I was a little skeptical about listening to Man-Killers of the Air as I have never cared much for air shows, but I became intrigued within the first five minutes. The main character, Smoke Burnham, is a definitely a daredevil as he travels with a cheetah! The plot is cleverly written and so is the dialogue. The sound effects are outstanding, making me feel like I was right there in the cockpit. The audiobook's length is two hours, but I became so involved with the characters that it felt more like one hour. Man-Killers of the Air is a fun flying adventure from the very start to the finish line.

The movie was released in 1974 to mainly drive-ins; despite being PG the movie is actually bloody. In The Day Time Ended (which is produced by Charles Band), A normal family is visited by alien beings, and these beings transports the family's home to prehistoric times. My favorite is Future Hunters starring Robert Patrick (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Linda Carol, who play a young couple who are given the Spear of Destiny by a man from the year 2025. The spear happens to the exact one that was used on Christ at the Crucifixion. If it falls into the wrong hands the world is doomed.Disclaimer - I received a free review copy from Tower PR in exchange for an honest review.

Welcome to the strange town of Spooksville, where not everything is what it seems. Watch, weird nickname for a kid, is suddenly ill. Someone has put a wicked spell on him. His friends Adam, Bryce, Sally, Cindy are going to find the underlying cause of it. They kids have been through many terrifying adventures, and this one is no different.They follow a strange man that had bumped into Watch shortly before he became ill. They watch him go into the cemetery and jump through the tombstone of Madeline Templeton. She was a famous witch and her tombstone was the portal to other dimensions and times.The kids follow the man through the portal and in up in a mirror Spooksville with copies of themselves living there. Will they save Watch and return home?I have read many Christopher Pike books over the years, but this is my first in the Spooksville series. Despite being book 20, I found it easy to follow the plot. I would have to say that the Goosebumps books by R.L. Stine inspired the Spooksville series. Overall, I found The Dangerous Quest fun to read.

I got into Tae Bo last year, but because of a few issues this year I had take a break in exercising, but instead of getting back in shape in January for a New Years Resolution, I decided to start in December. Tae Bo Cardio Explosion is not for beginners. It basically has the same set of punches and kicks from other Tae Bo videos, but slightly tweaked. There are a few advanced moves that involves jumping, probably inspired by the Insanity craze.Cardio Explosion is not Billy Blanks best workout DVD, but I was covered sweat by the end of the workout, which is about ten minutes less than what is printed on the DVD box cover. I do recommend the DVD to people who like kicking and punching.

I remember this being aired on SYFY, but I never watched it. I happened to run across it at my local Walmart and noticed Eddie Steeples and Ving Rhames was in it. I bought for under $10, and I thought I would give it a try.The plot is simple, months after a plague kills most of the American population, three friends are walking to the big city. They are attacked by zombies, resulting in one of them being killed, but the other two are rescued by a group of survivors, including Ving Rhames carrying a sledgehammer and a chick chopping the zombies' heads off with a sword. Their goal is to try to get through the city to the docks, as they heard there is a refuge on the island of Catalina.The acting in it is not bad, and the action scenes are great. For a low-budget movie I was impressed with the zombies' make-up, but I think they ran out of money when it came to the lame CGI tiger at the end.Considering I had no expectations for the movie, I actually liked.

The Goosebumps TV series aired in the early 1990s. The series had low-budget special effects, bad acting, and poorly adapted scripts based on the books by R.L. Stine.In My Best Friend is Invisible, Sam Jacobs and his best friend, Roxanne Johnson, are doing their school term paper on the haunted Hedge House, but there is something more scarier than ghost waiting for them.An Old School tells the tale of two brothers Tom and John who are being babysat by their Aunt Dahlia while their parents are gone. They eat a few of their Aunt's famous prune cookies and the brothers find themselves growing older and older.These are two of the oddest episodes from the series. An Old Story is more of a comedy, while My Best Friend is Invisible is more on the light-horror side. These are not the greatest episodes, but kids will like watching them around Halloween.

Erin's dad makes monsters for the Shocker Movie Studio. They are excited about trying out the new Shocker Studio's Tour Ride, but the monsters come to life.In Click, Seth is lazy and spends countless hours watching TV. He receives a new futuristic-looking remote in the mail, but the remote doesn't just control the TV, it also controls people. Now he can pause anyone he wants to.Don't expect fancy computer effects, all you get here is a low-budget, B-Movie quality special effects with below average acting. These are not the best episodes of Goosebumps, but kids will still like them.

The Goosebumps TV series, based on the books by R.L. Stine, aired in the late 1990s and is famous for it's low-budget special effects, bad acting, and bad script adaptions.In the Perfect School Part 1 & 2, Brian O'Connor gets shipped off to a private military like school, after his parents got tired of him picking on his younger brother, not cleaning his room, and his falling grades. The students that graduate from the school are perfect, too perfect. As the school is cloning the students and sending the clones back home.Perfect School is one of the worst adapted episodes from R.L. Stine's books. The sets are horrible, the acting is dreadful, and the dialogue is laughable. There is a twisted ending but it is predictable.Younger kids may like the Perfect School, while older kids and adults may have trouble getting through it.

Set in Alabama in the year 1859, Lily Edwards is awaiting the arrival of her cousin, Green Bethune. She will wed him through an arrange marriage. At least that is what her family has planned. Lily meets Harrison Wingate, a captain of a steamboat. Sparks fly between the two. When he leaves the shore for the river, he sends her letters. Now Lily must choose between her cousin and the captain.This is my first review through the LibraryThing Early Reviewers. "The River Between" is a simple love story with a Christian edge to it. The book is well-written, the historical scenes are great. I recommend this book to fans of romance novels.

The contact series were made to sell the Tae Bo punching bag that is used in the workouts. Some fans may not be impressed by the slowness of the workouts, as it mainly focuses on the upper body. I recommend wearing a pair of weighted gloves, and do the workout without a punching bag by using your own body weight. It can be a good workout for your arms, but it is not a great cardio workout.

While flipping through channels a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon Gilmore Girls. I recall when the series was first aired in 2000 and for some reason I never got around to watching an episode. What caught my eye was that Lauren Graham was constantly carrying around a cup of coffee, which so do I. After twenty minutes of viewing and listening to the snappy dialogue, I was now a fan. A few days later I went to a Target store in the city and found seasons one and two bundled together for twenty dollars.Gilmore Girls is set in the small, wacky town of Stars Hollows, where single mother Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham), manager of the Independence Inn, is raising her sixteen-year-old daughter Rory (played Alexis Bledel). When her daughter is accepted into the Chilton Preparatory School, Lorelai asks her rich estranged parents for financial help due to the school's expensive tuition. Of course things are not so simple as her parents want them to have Friday night dinners with them and be an active involvement in their lives.Besides from Lorelai and Rory's addiction to coffee, I like their quirky personalities. Lorelai is a fun and carefree mother, while Rory is a Harvard bound book nerd. The dialogue between the two is smart, snappy, and more real than other scripted shows. There are other colorful characters on the show as well, such as Luke Danes who owns the local diner; Lane Kim, Rory's best friend (When the series started the actress was 27 playing a 16 year-old.); and Sookie St. James, Lorelai's best friend and head chef at the Independence Inn (played by Melissa McCarthy).In just over a week, I watched the entire first season, but I did skip over a few that I had already seen. Even though the show is almost twelve years old, I find it to be a bit of fresh air compared to other horribly scripted shows on network television today.

After five origin movies (Iron Man,Iron Man 2,The Incredible Hulk,Captain America: The First Avenger,Thor), The Avengers ares finally assembled in an action-packed film directed by Joss Whedon. Putting all these superheroes into one movie couldn't have been easy, but Joss managed to give all the characters screen time, some more than others. The movie is a little slow at the beginning, but it picks up about forty-five minutes into it. I never cared for Loki in last year's Thor, but the character has grown in The Avengers. I was skeptical about Mark Ruffalo playing Bruce Dr. Banner/Hulk, but he played the character wonderfully. Finally, we get a Hulk that actually resembles the comic Hulk! The alien invading plot has been done to death (most recently inTransformers: Dark of the Moon), but it worked out well in The Avengers. Overall, I loved the DVD and I though the movie was great thanks to Joss's quirky dialogue.

I have very fond memories of The Littles television show based on John Peterson's beloved children books, and I was excited to watch the complete collection from Mill Creek Entertainment. All 29 episodes are on three DVDs. Honestly, I thought the series had more episodes. The show first aired in 1983 and lasted for three short seasons. In 1985, the Littles hit the big screen (but only showed in matinees) in the prequel Here Come the Littles. In 1986, they returned for the final outing in the made-for-television movie Liberty & the Littles.The Littles are only a few inches tall and have a mouse like ears and a tails. The main Littles were Tom and Lucy (brother and sister), their cousin Dinky, and Grandpa Little. Occasionally their parents appeared in a few episodes. They all live in the Bigg house, where a young boy, Henry Bigg, is the only one that knows of the existence.Of course, every cartoon needs a villain, and in the Littles, it is a crazy doctor who wants to prove that the Littles are real. With the help of Henry, the Littles always managed to out wit the mad doctor.The Littles has a clever and catchy theme song during the opening credits. The opening changes every season. During the first two seasons, at the ending of the episode there was a short segment where the Littles teach how to make a small toy out of everyday household items, but for them these items for tools or vehicles. During the third and final season, the segment switched into a history segment.I was two years old when The Littles aired, so I only recall bits and pieces of the series. It was shock watching the third season as the show premise changed. The Bigg family is traveling around the world and Littles go with them. Cousin Ashley Little is the new addition to the series. I was never aware that there were two movies until I bought the DVD. Here Come the Littles told the story of how Henry learned of their existence. Henry goes to live with is cruel uncle after is parents go missing. Tom and Lucy accidentally fall into Henry's bag. Dinky and Grandpa Little learn of their disappearance and go out to rescue them. The movie was a flop and panned by critics during its original release in 1985. The move slightly takes a darker tone while continuing the humor of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed it, which I cannot say the same for the made-for-television movie. Liberty & the Littles ditches Henry Bigg, and involves the Littles traveling to New York for a 4th of July vacation. Dinky crashes their plane near the Statue of Liberty where they meet a village of other Littles. Sadly, this was the last of The Littles! I wish they had a better exit, but I am more than happy that they are on DVD and I can relive some of my childhood.

I bought this 9 movies collection on 3 DVDs at my local Walmart for only five dollars.

After the DuckTales series came to an end, Disney had hoped to bring the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and crew to the big screen. The Ducktales The Movie: Treasures of the Last Lamp was a complete fop in 1990. I remember seeing the movie at my local theater when I was a kid. The movie is only available on DVD through the Disney Movie Club (which I'm a part of) and the Disney Movie Rewards.The DuckTales movie has Scrooge, his nephews (Huey, Dewey, and Louie), his adopted niece, Webbigail, and Launchpad on an adventure to find a golden lamp.The movie is still great to watch after all these years.

I've never heard of The Nurse before watching it tonight, in which it has a similar feel toThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle. The movie stars Lisa Zane (Billy Zane's older sister) as Laura Harriman, a nurse who wants revenge!Her father had recently murdered her mother and brother. Then he took his own life, all because he was accused of embezzling money. Bob Martin is the man who turned him over to the police and after hearing about the deaths, he has a stroke which leaves him paralyzed.Laura wants revenge for her family's deaths, so she kills Bob's live-in-nurse and she becomes his new nurse. Since he is paralyzed, he can't inform his wife or children about who the nurse really is. One by one, Laura plans on killing each family member while Bob watches helplessly.The movie was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in the late 90s and thanks for Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for releasing it to DVD, I bought the movie in an eight movie bundle. I didn't know what to expect when I saw Lisa Zane's name in the opening credits as I never cared for her inFreddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, but she gave a good performance as a psycho nurse. The movie is less horror and more like a made-for-TV thriller, except it has a few f-bombs in it. The Nurse isn't really scary, but I was entertained for 90 minutes!

This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.Greg and his friends decide to break into the old Coffman house in Say Cheese and Die. Greg finds an over-shaped camera and takes several pictures with it. He later realizes that the camera's pictures can tell the future before it happens.In Say Cheese and Die ... Again, Greg wrote a story for his English class about the evil camera, but his teacher gives him a big "F." Now Greg has to dig up the camera to proof that his story is real.The episodes were filmed a year apart. The actor that played Greg in the first episode plays Greg's older brother in the second, probably because of the actor's sudden growth spurt.These episodes are some of the creepiest out of the Goosebumps series!

If you wonder where Night of the Living Dummy is, well it was never adapted into an episode, probably because of Slappy not being in it.In Night of the Living Dummy II, Amy Kramer's ventriloquist dummy's head keeps popping off and her Dad brings her a new dummy from a second-hand store. The dummy is called Slappy! Suddenly, a series of accidents occur and Amy's parents blame her, when actually Slappy is responsible.In Bride of the Living Dead, Jimmy O' James and his ventriloquist dummy named Slappy, is playing gigs here and there to make money. One night Slappy falls in love with a doll that belongs to a young girl named Mary-Ellen. Slappy literally sends himself in the mail to the girl's house so he can be with the doll.I'm a big Slappy fan. The episodes are fun, but they don't do the books justice, thanks to the short running time.If you like this DVD, you should try Goosebumps -Goosebumps - Night of the Living Dummy III.

First off, my grandma owns this the complete series, not me! The package is not the best as some of the discs were difficult to remove. Disc 1 would not play at first, but after I did some cleaning and repairing, it now plays. There were a few others that I had to clean before they would play.The Book of Shadows container is a cute idea and is exactly what die hard fans would want.I had only watched a handful episodes during the original run, but I borrowed this set from grandma. Over about three months, I became addictive to the charmed ones, watching all the episodes. Charmed was and still is a great series.*The bonus disk has the original unaired pilot.

Set on a small island off England, ghost hunter Meredith Allen, along with private eye Jackson Hawke, investigates the strange occurrences happening at the Croft Castle. Of course, this castle is your typical haunted castle with secret passages, eerie lights and ghosts.Jackson is a non-believer of the supernatural and believes that a human is responsible for the strange happenings at the castle. At first, Meredith wants nothing to do with Jackson, but this is a romance novel, so she falls for him. They explore the castle and uncover a dark mystery.This was an easy fast read for me. One thing that really bothered if Meredith was suppose to be a ghost hunter, why didn't she have any ghost hunting gizmos with her? The book cover says this is a gothic romance. Beside for being set a castle, I never really got the feeling that this was a gothic novel. Overall, I enjoyed the novel because of its fun characters.

I had never heard of The Tattooist before. It's a New Zealand production and was released in 2007. Jason Behr stars as the tattoo artist Jake Sawyer, who happens to steal an old tattoo tool. He accidentally cuts himself with it, releasing a tattoo Samoan demon.I wasn't expecting too much from a movie that I have never heard of, but The Tattoo isn't a bad movie considering its small budget. Actually, the special effects really standout compared to the big-budget horror movies. I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie as it is more of a mystery.

I found this 2-disc collection thrown into the five-dollar bin at Walmart. The majority of the movies are from the old Miramax studio and now Echo Bridge is releasing some of their titles to DVD.In this collection are Six Degrees of Helter Skelter, The Hole, The Nameless, The Crow: Wicked Prayer, Ritual, Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest, Mortuary, and Wes Craven Presents They.The Helter Skelter is a documentary about the Manson Family Murders, in which I never plan to watch, as the subject just does not interest me.The Nameless is a Spanish film from the same director of theDarkness [Blu-ray]. It is an interesting film, but for the most part, it is boring.Children of the Corn III is the best of direct-to-video sequels. It is actually a scary movie, until the last twenty minutes when the studio must have ran out of money for the special effects.Ritual is actually a Tales from the Crypt movie, but was shelved because ofTales from the Crypt Presents - Bordello Of Bloodflopped at the box-office. It was released overseas in 2002 and it came out on DVD in the USA in 2006 under Tales from the Crypt Presents title, featuring a low-budget Crypt keeper intro. Ritual is also a remake of the classicI Walked with a Zombie [VHS]. Jennifer Grey stars in this voodoo thriller, which is not that bad of a movie.Mortuary is a creepy tale from director Todd Hooper about a mother, her teenage son, and her young daughter moving into a rundown mortuary that has a cemetery for a front yard. The plot involves, black ooze, zombies, a disfigured person, and just plain craziness. It is not Todd's best work, but I still like it for some weird reason.Wes Craven Present's: They is a PG-13 horror movie about a group of adults that are being killed one by one by mysterious creatures that come out of dark. Considering it's not rated R, it is not that bad of a movie.The Hole stars Thora Bitch (Hocus Pocus) and Kira Knightley (Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)). I have never heard of the movie before buying this DVD, so it was the first movie that I watched. The plot involves four prep school kids being locked into an abandoned bomb shelter in England. It is not really a horror movie, but more of a thriller. Thora gives a great performance in it.The Crow: Wicked Prayer stars Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray]), David Boreanaz (Angel: The Complete Series (Collector's Set),Bones: The Complete Second Season), and Dennis Hoffman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (The Gruesome Edition)). One would think by the cast that the movie might be decent, but it is the worst in the series thanks to a bad script and overacting.Despite a few not so great movies, the eight-movie pack is a steal at the price and I did enjoy several of the movies.

I only bought this for the Howling IV (which I recall seeing as a kid) and The Gingerdead Man (I have heard of it, but I have never seen it.) I have never heard of the other four movies on this 2 disc set.Besides from The Prophecy, the movies are low-budget horror flicks. The majority of them are slight below average, but a few are fun to watch.

I found this 8 Horror films 2 discs set in the five dollar bin at my local Walmart. I already own three of the movies, Puppet Master, The Prophecy II, and Halloween: Resurrection, but I bought the DVD for one other movie called Wes Craven Presents: Dracula III: Legacy.Dracula III is better than Dracula II. The plot isn't great, but there is enough vampire bloody scenes and nudity to make any any horror fan happy.The other four movies on the set are Roman, The Nurse, Live Animals, and Paranormal Entity.Roman stars Lucky McKee (who normally directs) as a shy social outcast who accidentally kills a girl (played by Kristen Bell) that he has a crush on. He keeps her body on ice in his bathtub. His depressed life changes when a strange woman becomes interested in him. This is an odd little movie. When it first starts you can easily tell that it is an low-budget film with bad camera work and lighting. I almost pushed the stop button, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad that I did. It is a strange movie, more of a thriller than a horror film. I actually felt sorry for Roman!The Nurse is a low-budget ripoff of The Hand That Rocked the Cradle. The movie was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in the late 90s and thanks for Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for releasing it to DVD, I bought the movie in an eight movie bundle. I didn't know what to expect when I saw Lisa Zane's name in the opening credits as I never cared for her in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, but she gave a good performance as a psycho nurse. The movie is less horror and more like a made-for-TV thriller, except it has a few f-bombs in it. The Nurse isn't really scary, but I was entertained for 90 minutes!Live Animals is about a group of young adults who are kidnapped and tortured by a group of psychos, who plan on selling them to the highest bidder. The movie is a ripoff of the Hostel movies and the Saw films. It has a low-budget, bad acting, and plot holes every two minutes. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I couldn't get through Paranormal Entity as it was so badly written, acted, and directed. I have seen several movies from The ASYLUM and this is their worst movie! The movie is a mockbuster of Paranormal Activity. Avoid this movie at all cost!As for the three movies that I already own, The Prophecy II is the best with Christopher Walken returning as the fallen angel. This time he is after a woman and her unborn child, who happens to be part angel. It's not as good the first, but it is the best out of the sequels.Andre Toulon's demonic puppets make their first screen debut in The Puppet Master, which isn't the best in the series as the pacing is a little slow, but it is fun to watch.The Halloween movies are my favorite out of the horror genre, and Halloween: Resurrection happens to be my least favorite, except for the first fifteen minutes with Jamie Lee Curtis, then the movie goes to hell. I give the director credit for doing the best he could with a horrible script.Despite a few unwatchable movies, I'm satisfied with the 2 disc set.

It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is a classic Halloween cartoon, but sadly it is edited when it is aired on television every year. I bought this DVD, which also contains You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown as a bonus, in a 3 Discs Holiday Collection which included A Charlie Brown Christmas and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving several years ago. Since then there has been several other DVD releases of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, but I have to say that this one is the best that is out there.

I've been looking for the movie Venom starring Jonathan Jackson and Agnes Bruckner for several years now and I just happen to stumble upon it at my local Walmart today wrapped up with theThe Midnight Horror Collection: Flesh Eating Zombies Seriesfor only five dollars. Not a bad price for a few horror movies. I have already seen Children of the Corn 666, which is one of the better sequels. Of course Dust Devil is the edited version instead of the hard-to-find director's cut, but I'm still looking forward to watching the movie. I have heard of El Muerto (The Dead One), but I have never seen it. As for the other two movies, I have never heard of them before.Disc One:The Dead One (El Muerto; 2007; 88 minutes; Rated PG-13)Children of the Corn 666: Isacc's Return (1999; 82; Rated R)Venom (2005; 85 minutes: Rated R)Dust Devil (Released in 1993, but filmed in 1991; 87 minutes; Rated R)Disc Two:The Final Patient (2005; 100 minutes; Not Rated)Beneath the Mississippi (2008; 109; Not Rated)

The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.The episodes on this single disc are:The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight - Jodie and Mark are visiting their grandparent's farm, when twelve odd scarecrows show up.Don't Go to Sleep - Matt Amsterdam wakes up from a nap to find out that his whole reality has changed.Calling All Creeps - Ricky Beamer wants revenge on a mean girl at school. He puts her phone number in an ad for all creeps to call her, but he wasn't expecting non-humans to reply.These three tales are some of the best of the Goosebumps series. Don't Go to Sleep reminds me of an episode of the X-files, The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight is creepy, and Calling All Creeps is insane!

Mummies come alive to stop them from opening the tomb.Don't Wake Mummy has Jeff Carter receiving a gift from his archaeologist father - a 4,000 year-old-mummy!Eddie and Hat are going to scare a friend of theirs at Mud Creek, but there is a Mud Monster waiting for them.The latter is my favorite of the three episodes. Each episode is G rated with no blood or gore, so it is safe for the entire family to watch it.

The book starts out in the early morning hours of 1965, two teen siblings, Jeremy and Beth, are killed in a car accident. The book then skips to the present day where Reenie Baker starts dating P.J., the new shy kid. Reenie also makes friends with the new girl in town, Liz.At a Christmas party, a terrible prank goes wrong. Reenie and her friends believe that P.J. has died of a bad heart. They soon discover that his body is missing. Is P.J. still alive, or is someone out for revenge from the grave?"The New Year's Party," is a fun read, but it does have some violence in it. Just like real life, the teens in this book can be cruel to others, but R.L. Stine throws in a supernatural twist towards the end. If you're looking for a good thriller, check this book out.

The Mechanic is $1.96 movie that I bought during last week's Black Friday. The movie is a remake of Charles Bronson's 1972 action film of the same name. Over the years I have become a fan of Statham's movies and surprisingly The Mechanic is above average action flick. Both Jason Statham and Ben Foster give great performances. The director Simon West also did a great job putting together a tight movie. Overall, even though it wasn't a perfect movie, I was entertained until the final explosion.

Pulp fiction magazines were extremely poplar during the 1930s and 1940s covering any genre you can think of. There was no internet and cable television to occupy your free time with, so people read pulps and cheap novels for entertainment, not to mention listening to radio serials. Author L. Ron Hubbard wrote hundreds of short stories in about every genre during these years. Now Galaxy Press is bringing out these great stories through their new audiobooks line called Stories from the Golden Age.Galaxy Press was nice enough to send me a free copy of The Chee-Chalker that first appeared in the July/August 1947 issue of Five-Novels Magazine.The story starts out with FBI Agent Bill Norton and his assistant, Chick, being sent to the remote location of Ketchikan, Alaska as he is hunting down his ex-boss, who had disappeared. Norton boss's disappearance might be related to a heroin smuggling ring that is operating near a fishing fleet. As Norton continues to investigate, he runs across several corpses. Supposedly, they all died by accidental drowning, but Norton knows that they were murdered.This exciting tale has an incredible voice cast and amazing sound effects. "The Chee-Chalker" is what the locals call Norton as it means "newcomer". The audiobook runs just under two hours and it has twists and turns around every corner. The main plot is a murder mystery, but there is a little romance thrown in involving Norton and a local heiress. Out of the several L. Ron Hubbard audiobooks that I have reviewed, The Chee-Chalker is my favorite.

Based on the fist Stephanie Plum novel, published in 1994, by bestselling author Janet Evanovich, Katherine Heigl steps into Plum's shoes as her life has been turned upside down when she become unemployed. With nowhere else to turn to, she takes a job at her cousin Vinnie's Bail Bond as a bail enforcement agent, aka a bounty hunter.Her first assignment is to bring in a former vice cop Joe Morelli, who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend from high school. And she might have tried to hit him with a car. She is determined to bring him in, but in the process stumbles upon the real killer.I recall seeing a few advertisements early in the year for One For the Money, mostly with the funny dinner scenes with Debbie Reynolds. After being panned by critics, getting a 2% rating on rottentomatoes.com, and flopping at the box-office, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I happened to stumbled upon the DVD last week for under fifteen dollars and I noticed Life on Mars's Jason O'Mara was in it, so I thought I would give it a try. With no expectations, I actually enjoyed the movie for what it is, an innocent fluff despite the short running time of 91 minutes. Katherine Heigl is adorable and has a sparkling chemistry with Jason O'Mara. Debbie Reynolds steals every scene she is in. Now this movie is never going to win any Oscars with its plot, which has several holes, a not-so-great villain and a predictable ending. At times the movie feels less like a theatrical release and more like a television pilot, where it probably would have been more successful. I wonder why it cost forty million to make this movie, the studio could have filmed it on a lower budget and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. Despite several flaws, I enjoyed the quirky characters.

It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is one my guilty pleasures in life. The characters are complete losers and the plots are crazy, but thanks to great writing its one of the funniest series currently on television.When I ordered this last week I only paid $24.99 and it is well worth the price for the uncut episodes. This season had a twist with Mac gaining weight and all is revealed in "How Mac Got Fat". My favorite episodes are the two-part season finale in which the gang, and Frank, returns to their high school for a reunion.The episodes in season seven are:Disc 1:Frank's Pretty WomanThe Gang Goes to The Jersey ShoreFrank Reynolds' Little BeautiesSweet Dee Gets AuditedFrank's BrotherThe Storm of the CenturyChardee Macdennis: The Game of GamesDisc 2:The Anti-Social NetworkThe Gang Gets TrappedHow Mac Got FatThunder Gum ExpressThe High School ReunionThe High School Reunion Part 2: The Gang's RevengeSpecial Features:Blooper ReelArtemis Tours PhiladelphiaCommentary on: "The Anti-Social Network", "The Gang Gets Trapped", and "The High School Reunion Part 2"

With Halloween just days away, there's nothing better than watching horror movies, which are constantly being aired on cable channels, but most of them are edited for content. Mill Creek Entertainment recently released four shocking horror films onto a two-discs set. Tower PR and Mill Creek Entertainment kindly sent me a complementary copy to review. This pack contains the splatter-fest Hostel (2006) and its sequel Hostel II (2007), along with The Tattooist (2007) and The Hunt for the BTK Killer (2005).Hostel starts out as a typical college vacation trip film, where Josh, Paxton, and their new friend &Oacute;li just want to have a good time. They get a tip that there are 'easy' beautiful women in Bratislava and of course they go. Things seem normal as they meet three women who seduce them, but they have no idea of what horrors await them.Hostel is not for the weak-hearted! It, along with the Saw movies, created what is known as the "torture porn" genre. The first half is more-or-less a raunchy comedy, but then after a few twists and turns, the mayhem begins. It is sick to think that there might be rich powerful people that want to torture and kill a person. The movie is well acted and the last thirty-minutes is intense, but it is also twisted.Hostel Part II pickups where the first leaves off, in which you find out what happened to Paxton. Ten minutes later, the movie focuses on three female art students who happen to travel to a small Slovakian village. Their vacation comes to an end quickly as the Elite Hunting group is watching them.The first ten minutes is great continuing Paxton's story, but the movie jumps to three new characters. I was a little disappointed as I wanted to see Paxton's girlfriend, Stephanie (played by Jordan Ladd), hunt and kill the Elite Hunting group, but sadly her character is never mentioned again.The first hour is boring, but the last twenty minutes is intense. The killers get more screen time, but it adds nothing important to this sequel. Overall, I think the first movie was more watchable.I had never heard of The Tattooist before. It's a New Zealand production and was released in 2007. Jason Behr stars as the tattoo artist Jake Sawyer, who happens to steal an old tattoo tool. He accidentally cuts himself with it, releasing a tattoo Samoan demon.I wasn't expecting too much from a movie that I have never heard of, but The Tattoo isn't a bad movie considering its small budget. Actually, the special effects really standout compared to the big-budget horror movies. I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie as it is more of a mystery.The Hunt For the BTK Killer is based on the book Nightmare in Wichita: The Hunt for the BTK Strangler, which is also based on the real serial killer. The movie first aired in 2005 on CBS, but it later made its way to DVD. Between the years 1974 and 1991, Dennis Rader murdered ten people in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Gregg Henry plays the serial killer and he does a great job playing the psychopath.I'm aware of the case as I live in Missouri and Rader's capture in 2005 was all over the news. Despite being made-for-television, The Hunt for the BTK Killer is a well made film with decent acting.The picture quality is good considering there are two movies on each disc. Hostel and Hostel 2 are in 2:35:1 with English 5.1 audio. The Tattooist and The Hunt for the BTK Killer are in 1.78:1 aspect ratio with English 2.0 audio.Like I said above, Hostel and Hostel II (both the unrated versions) are not for the weak-hearted. The other two movies were surprisingly good. Overall, I enjoyed watching the movies and I recommend this 4-Pack to all horror fans.

I never knew this movie even existed until a few years ago when I found it on DVD. John Ritter and Jeffrey Jones are hilarious in it. The premise is clever, but there are a few plot holes here and there. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the movie mostly because of the parodies of Three's Company, Married with Children, and the six-minute Rooney Tunes animated by Chuck Jones.

With all the 21 Jump Street remake advertisements a few months ago, I dragged out the original series in which I have in a complete series that Mill Creek Entertainment brought out in 2010. It cost under $40.00 at the time, but I believe it can be purchased for less now, which is a great price for the 103 episodes. The bad news is that there is one episode missing, which happens to be the last episode with Officer Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp). I heard there was a music rights issue with the episode. Despite one being missing, I enjoyed watching the rest.The episodes in the collection are:Season OneDisc One:Pilot - Part 1Pilot - Part 2America, What a TownDon't Pet the TeacherMy Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear ShadesThe Worst Night of Your LifeGotta Finish the RiffDisc Two:Bad InfluenceBlindsidedNext GenerationLow and Away16 Blown to 35Mean Streets and Patel HousesSeason TwoDisc One:In the Custody of a ClownBesieged: Part 1Besieged: Part 2Two for the RoadAfter School SpecialHigher EductionDisc Two:Don't Stretch the RainbowHonor BoundYou Oughta Be In PrisonHow Much is That Body in the WindowChristmas in SaigonFear and Loathing with Russell BuckinsDisc Three:A Big Disease With a Little NameChapel of LoveI'm OK - You Need WorkOrpheus 3.3Champagne HighDisc Four:Brother HansonThe Miracle of Renner's PondRaising MarijuanaBest Years of Your LifeCory and Dean Got MarriedSchool's OutSeason ThreeDisc One:Fun with AnimalsSlippin' Into DarknessThe Currency We Trade InCoach of the YearWhose Chose Is It AnywayDisc Two:Hell WeekThe Dragon and the AngelThe Blu FluSwallowed AliveWhat About Love?Disc Three:Wodlly BulliesThe Dreaded Return of Russell BuckinsA.W.O.L.NemesisFathers & SonsDisc Four:High SchoolBlinded by the Thousand Points of LightNext VictimLoc'd Out (Part 1)Loc'd Out (Part 2)Season FourDisc One:Draw the LineSay It Ain't So, PeteEternal FlameCome from the ShadowsGod is a BulletOld Haunts in the New AgeOut of ControlDisc Two:Stand by Your ManWheels and Deals Part 1Wheels and Deals Part 2Parental Guidance SuggestedThings We Said TodayResearch and DestroyDisc Three:A Change of HeartBack From the Future2245Hi MomAWomp-Bomp-AloobompLa BizcaDisc Four:Last Chance HighUnfinished BusinessShirts and SkinsHow I Saved the SenatorRounding ThirdEveryday is ChristmasSeason FiveDisc One:Tunnel of LoveBack to SchoolBuddy SystemPoisonJust Say No!

The Twisted Window is written by the teen thriller-master, Lois Duncan. The book was original published back in 1987, but has been released onto Kindle with a few minor changes, the mention of cell phones, DVDs, etc. I've been a Lois Duncan fan every since I read I Know What You Did Last Summer (the book, not the movie) when I was a teenager, so when I saw this book up on Netgalley, I had to review it.Tracy Lloyd had recently lost her mother, her father practically abandoned her, and she now resides in a small town with her aunt and uncle. The plot begins with a strange boy named Brad started staring at her during lunch hour at school. Brad is from Albuquerque, but he doesn't exactly go to her school. He follows her around and eventually asks her out. She thinks it is a date, but it isn't what he had in mine.Brad needs Tracy's help as his baby sister, Mindy, was kidnapped four months ago by his soon-to-be ex-stepfather, Gavin Brummer. His mother is hysterical and she can't handle the situation. The police are clueless about the whereabouts of Gavin, so Brad is investigating the kidnapping himself. Of course Gavin already knows Brad, so he needs someone that Gavin doesn't recognize and that is where Tracy comes into the plot.Being a nice person, Tracy agrees to help Brad find his little sister, but as she gets more involved in the case, she starts to realize that Brad may not be telling the truth.What I have always loved about Lois Duncan's writings is that she uses realistic plots for her teenage characters. The Twisted Window may not be her best known book, but it contains an intriguing mystery with several twists and turns around every corner. I don't care for publishers updating technology and stuff in older books as it doesn't flow well with the plot. As for the mystery, just when I thought I knew what was going on, the author throws in a few twists to keeping your mind boggling. The Twisted Window is an intense, character driven thriller that I recommend to others.

TMNT is a somewhat underrated kids animated movie. It resembles the style of the 2003 series and at the same time it is a loose sequel to the "live" 90's film trilogy.I grew up on the original cartoon and movies, and I bought the this DVD to go with my collection. I have only watched it twice. The movie is cute for younger kids, but older fans may not like it as much. There should have been more action at the ending fight scene. Overall, the movie felt like an expanded episode of the series. It should have been made direct to DVD instead of on the big screen.The movie is not a complete letdown as it is fun to watch.

The Howling is one of the better werewolf movies that were made in the 1980s and it is inspired by the 1977 novel of the same name by Gary Brandner.The plot involves a TV reporter Karen White barely escaping a sexual assault from the serial murderer named Eddie Quist, whom the police shoot to death. Karen blocks the incident from her mind. She tries to go back to work, but she cannot get over the trauma. Her shrink advices she go on a vacation at a resort in the countryside called "The Colony."Shortly after arriving, Karen's husband, Bill, barely avoids a tryst with Marsha Quist, a nymphomaniac, and is bitten by a wolf. He eventually sleeps with Marsha and transforms into a werewolf.Karen's friend Terri arrives, but it may be too late as Eddie Quist is alive and howling.Out of the countless Howling movies, the first is the best. Sure, there are a few plot holes, but it has one of the greatest werewolf transformations ever filmed.

Book Two of Season One continues the adventures of Lion-O, his brother Tygra, Panthro, Snarf, Wilykit and Wilykat. Now with the Book of Omens in their possession, they travel to the outer wastelands, magical forests, and even dimensions searching for power stones that Mumm-Ra so desperately wants.The Berbils make their debut in the reboot series, and they are still the loveable robotic teddy bears that I remember from the original series. They also return for another episode to help out Panthro with a new set of arms and they "reboot" the thundertank. The Trials of Lion-O Part one and two remind be of the five part episodes from the original.Just like Book One there are only eight episodes, but these eight are well-written with great animation that any Thundercat's fan will enjoy. Sadly, I'll have to wait until October for the Book 3, which will have ten episodes, to come out.

The film starts in the year 1760, where the Collins along with their young son Barnabas leave Liverpool and travel to the United States, where they open up a fishing port in Maine. Years go by and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) grows up to be somewhat of a playboy, fooling around a servant, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who is actually a powerful witch. Barnabas falls in love with Josette du Pres and rejects Angelique's affections, but the witch doesn't like rejection. She forces Josette to jump off a cliff, and one by one the Collins die. All but Barnabas as Angelique has cursed him into a vampire. When the town people find out about the vampire, they chain Barnabas inside a coffin and bury him.It's now 1972 and a young woman named Maggie Evans is arriving at the Collinwood Manor. She is running away from her haunting past and uses the name Victoria Winters as she accepts the job as David Collin's governess.A group of construction works stumble upon a coffin and releases the vampire Barnabas Collins, who returns to the Collinwood Manor where he meets the handyman Willie Loomis and makes him his servant. Barnabas introduces himself to the family as a distant cousin, but he does not fool the head of the household, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). With no other choice, he unveils himself as their ancestor and now a cursed vampire. He wants to be a member of the family and help restore the Collins canning business, which has went under because of a competitor, Angel Bay Fishery.Barnabas is stunned when he sees Victoria Winters as she is the split image of his long lost love Josette. He is determined to romance the young governess. The Collins doctor, who lives with them, Dr. Hoffman easily figures out that Barnabas is a vampire, and insists that she can find a cure for the curse. Out his control, Barnabas is charming to all women and Dr. Hoffman falls in love with him.After restoring Collinwood and the canning business, Barnabas learns that Angel Bay Fishery is owned by Angelique, who has been trying to end the Collins family line for years. She still loves Barnabas, but he still does not return her affections. Therefore, Angelique plans on destroying Barnabas and the rest of the Collins.I went into this movie fully aware that this was a Tim Burton movie; therefore I was probably going to get a gothic comedy, in which I did. A die hard Dark Shadows fan will be disappointed that their favorite Gothic drama is now a comedy, but I watched the movie for what it was, a silly Gothic tale. The sets and the costumes look amazing. I thought Eve Green was miscast. Don't get me wrong, she is a great actress and she looks the part of Angelique, but I never felt that she was truly evil. Michelle Pfeiffer looks great for her age and she does a marvelous job playing Elizabeth. Jackie Earle Haley was the best actor in this remake, putting a new spin on Willie Loomis. Johnny Depp is goofy all the way through the movie, and looks less like the 60's Barnabas and more like an old-school vampire. Even though Barnabas is a murderer, Depp made the character funny and likeable. Now I did have some issues with Helena Bonham Carter portrayal of Dr. Hoffman, who is now a lonely drunk. I felt she was never in character and was just there to be there.The screenplay writer Seth Grahame-Smith threw in all the Dark Shadows best with a vampire, a witch, a werewolf, and ghosts. I was disappointed that Quentin never made an appearance, but I guess that was why another Collins was a werewolf, which added nothing to the plot. I liked the small ghost storyline and the CGI special effects never bothered me. I am not for sure why Seth and Tim decided to mold Maggie Evans and Victoria Winters into one character, but it didn't bother me one bit.Dark Shadows is somewhat underrated as I did enjoy the movie for what it was, a fun Gothic romp.

It is a year later after the events of the first novel, and Reva Dalby has not changed a bit. She is once again working at her father's department store, and once again being rude the customers.Late one night, Mr. Dalby receives a phone call that his daughter has been kidnapped, but there is one little problem for the kidnappers - Reva was at home. The kidnappers had kidnapped her cousin, Pam. The kidnappers let Pam go.Reva's life is back to normal, except that the kidnappers are planning on snatching Reva and her cousin, Pam, for ransom.Silent Night 2 is not as good as the first, but it is still worth reading. I was glad that R.L. Stine did not copy the plot from the first novel. The kidnapping plot made the story interesting. Reva is a great character. No matter what happens in her life, she never changes. If you liked the first novel, then you'll like the sequel.

I grew up watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series and the live movies. I stumbled uponTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Original Series - Season 4back in 2007 at a Walmart store and of course I had to buy it. I later ordered the previous seasons which were never released in sets; instead they were released in six volumes.I patiently wait for every new season to be released. WhenTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Original Series - Season 5was released back in August 2007, I, like many other fans, was disappointed that two episodes were left out of the set. I was disappointed again in the next four season releases as they didn't have the missing episodes either.LionsGate has finally released the tenth and final season to DVD. For a bonus, the two missing episodes "Once Upon a Time Machine" and the double length episode "Planet of the Turtleoids" are included.Season 10 Episodes are:The Return of DreggThe Beginning of the EndThe Power of ThreeA Turtle in TimeTurtles to the Second PowerMobster From Dimension XThe Day the Earth DisappearedDivide and ConquerFour of the season ten episodes are also on theTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Series, Volume Oneas bonuses. For the last three seasons, the animation in the series became darker and added a red sky. Some of the humor was taken out and the characters were less developed. Season ten continues from whereTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Season 9had left off, where their new friend from the future, Carter, continues to work with Donatello to solve the turtles and his own mutation problems. Meanwhile, Lord Dregg is slowly going mad as he is determined to destroy the turtles once and for all.Highlights include the three final appearances of Shredder and Krang, and of course of the final episodes when the Turtles use Krang's android body to stop Dregg.It's nice to finally own the final episodes and the two lost episodes. Season ten may have not been the best season, but it is still better than the new animation programs on television today. This is a must have for TMNT cartoon fans.

Does anyone recall the bookshelves of the school book fair being filled with teen horror books? I got caught up in the horror madness in the early 90s, about the time I started watching the 1978's Halloween at the age of nine, and I stumbled upon the bizarre world of R.L. Stine, a few years before the Goosebumps phenomenon hit the shelves. I read and collected dozens of R.L. Stine novels back in the day, but as I grew up I lost interest. Luckily I kept all of the books and I started collecting R.L. Stine, along with other Point Horror books, again.Last Christmas, I received Halloween Party by R.L Stine, which is part of the Fear Street series, which I have always wondered why none of the books have every been made into a cheap horror movie or a low-rated CW series. I've never read the book before and was memorized by the snappy new cover design from the Simon Pulse release. There's something about a jack-o-lantern that gives me the creeps. I tossed the book on the coffee table and had forgotten about it until last month when I was planning the 13 Days of Halloween posts. I thought it would be a perfect time to read it.The Halloween Party is about a teen, Terry Ryan, who, along with his girlfriend, Niki Meyer (Michael Meyers? A Coincidence? Why is there always someone with the last name Meyer or Meyers in a horror novel?) has been invited, along with a selected number of guests, to the Halloween Party of Justine, a new student to Shadyside High with a mysterious past. The party is being held at the old Cameron Mansion on Fear Street, beyond the cemetery. The mansion is said to be haunted!This is not your typical party as all Justine wants to do is play wicked, cruel games to embarrass her fellow students. Then, out of nowhere, several bikers crash the party, reminding me of the party scene from the movie Weird Science. While the new unwelcome guests causes a little chaos, Niki disappears and one of the partiers is found dead! Terry searches through the spooky mansion in search of his missing girlfriend, while Justine unleashes her revenge plot.I have to admit that I normally zoom right through Fear Street novels, but I had trouble getting into this one until I was about the middle of the book. I rolled my eyes as the bikers invaded the party, and my stomach quenched at every cruel joke Justine unleashed. Only when Terry learns of the mansion's previous owners' deaths does the plot actually get interesting, and you finally understand why Justine only invited specific guests. Despite that fact that Halloween Party is not the best of the Fear Street, I still enjoyed the few twists and turns that made it a decent read. I can easily see this being made into a TV movie, but I guess those are too rare these days thanks to the boring scripted reality shows. Let me give you some advice: If you get invited to a party at an old mansion next to a cemetery - Don't Go!

I've caught a few minutes of She's Out of My League several times when it has aired on the E! cable channel. I recently bought it on DVD and I'm glad that I did as it is heavily edited on television. Yes, the channel cut out the language, but there were several funny and essential scenes that were deleted.Even though it is rated R, it isn't as raunchy as most recent comedies are, but it still is hilarious.

I bought the Last of the Living along with three other zombie flicks for only five dollars at Walmart. I wasn't expecting much from a low-budget movie, but Last of the Living is actually funny despite some terrible zombie makeup.The plot involves three slackers, Morgan, Johnny, and Ash, as they spend their days playing video games and watching movies in mansions. They accidentally run into a female scientist, Stef, who claims to have a cure, but she needs help getting a vile of blood to an island, where the military are suppose to be located.The characters are silly, but likeable. Considering I had never heard of the movie before I wasn't planning on liking it this much.

I don't care for remakes/reboots, but new Thundercats was a nice surprise as it stayed close to the mythology of the original while taking the series in a different direction. Omens Part One and Two shows Thundera on an epic scale. The evil Mumm-Ra and his army attack the city. The Lord of the Thundercats is killed in the battle leaving his son Lion-O the Sword of Omens.Lion-O goes on a quest to find the Book of Omens along with his older brother Tygra, the fast running Cheetara, the little thieves Wilykit and Wilykat, his pet Snarf, and elder warrior Panthro.The series is well-written and the animation is better than any other cartoon on TV today. The only downside about the Season One Book One DVD is that there are only eight episodes. For a remake, Thundercats has a great start to become a classic.

I got my copy of this DVD through the Disney Movie Rewards Program.The episodes are:Checkin' Out (That's So Raven)That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)On the Road Again (Hannah Montana)Bonus episode: Health and Fitness (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)I have seen the second episodes dozens of times late at night on the Disney Channel and it was nice to finally see part 1 and part 3. Checkin' Out is actually the final episode that was filmed for That's So Raven, even though it aired in the middle of the final season. The first episodes are great, but I dislike the last episode. Besides from Maddie's cameo, it has nothing to do with the other episodes.

I've never been a fan of Yoga, but I was given this DVD last year for Christmas. I never even opened it until recently when I had injured my back. I was advised to do some kind of stretching or yoga. Since I already had the DVD, I gave it a try. I have to say this isn't the yoga that I have seen on TV programs as Jillian Michaels has added her own twists that is meant to make you burn calories. There are two workouts on this DVD, but so far I have only tried Level 1 and let me tell you it is a pain in the neck to get through it. I was literally covered in sweat at the end of the workout. The good news is that it did help my back.

I received The Best of Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? in a DVD giveaway package I won from a blog several weeks ago. The show aired in 1994 and ended in 1998. I vaguely recall the series ever airing as I was a thirteen-year-old and I was more into horror movies at the time. The series is based on the popular pc/video game and the PBS kid's game show; both titled Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?. Thanks to Cookie Jar (Mill Creek Entertainment) this cartoon and others are now available on DVD.The show takes place in a virtual reality where a 'live' kid known as "The Player" is playing the game as two sibling characters Zack and Ivy, who are both ACME detectives. Carmen Sandiego is the main thief along with her V.I.L.E gang, who in each episode steals an artifact and travels the world to through off the authorities. This is where Zack and Ivy come in as they must find the clues Carmen leaves behind and figure out her next move. Of course at the end of every episode, the kids recover the artifact and Carmen gets away.A lot of cartoons in the 80s and early 90s got a lot of heat from Congress over their violence and for being non-educational. In 1994 Fox Kids aired the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the X-Men which contained some violence, therefore Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?.If Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? aired a few years earlier, I probably still wouldn't have watched it, as I was more into TMNT, Thundercats, etc... Now as an adult, I enjoyed watching these ten episodes, which does contain some G-rated adventures, while at the same time you learn a little history and geography lesson. Younger kids will like the two fun teenage detectives as they try to stop the legendary thief, while adults will like the educational aspects of the series. Overall, I enjoyed the DVD and I recommend it to others.

I think I paid under ten dollars for it in 2007. Yes, I understand why some old fans don't like the new series, but after awhile it grew on me.

I stumbled across this two disc set at my local Dollar General store a few years ago and I bought it for only five dollars, which isn't bad for over five hours of entertainment. The problem I have is that there is actually 26 episodes in Season Four.The Episodes included in this set are:Disc 1Still NobodySamurai TouristThe Ancient OneScion of the ShredderProdigal SonOutbreakThe Trouble With AugieInsane in the MembraneDisc 2The Return of the Savanti Romero: Part 1The Return of the Savanti Romero: Part 2Tale of Master YoshiAdventures in Turtle-SittingGood Genes Part 1Good Genes Part 2Bonus Features:Never-Before-Seen TMNT ShortsAnimatic ClipsDVD-ROM Web LinksFor the price, I'm satisfied for what I paid for, but I would have liked to have had the complete season 4. Hopefully, the new owners Nickelodeon will release complete sets in the near future.

I've been a big fan of The Walking Dead ever since the first season aired on AMC in 2010, but I never got around to buying the DVD sets. I attended the 8 PM Thursday (aka Black Friday sale) sale at my local Walmart just so I could get season one and a few other DVDS at a cheap price. I had to wiggle my way around a mob of shoppers to grab the last DVD set, which I paid just under ten dollars for.It only took me two nights to go through the short season of six episodes. They were just as good as when I originally watched them. The show is one of the best written series on television and it keeps getting better with every episode.The episodes on the 2-disc set are:Disc 1:Episode 1: Days Gone ByeEpisode 2: GutsEpisode 3: Tell It to the FrogsEpisode 4: VatosDisc 2:Episode 5: WildfireEpisode 6: TS-19Bonus Features:Making of The Walking DeadInside The Walking Dead: Episodes 1-6A Sneak Peek with Robert KirkmanBehind the Scenes Zombie Make-up TipsConvention Panel with ProducersThe Walking Dead TrailerExtra Footage:Zombie SchoolBicycle GirlOn Set with Robert KirkmanHanging with Stephen YeunInside Dale's RVOn Set With Andrew Lincoln

After one of the suspects jumps out of a moving van and rolls down a hill, Sheriff Roan Benedict pulls out his gun and fires, only to realize that he had just shot a woman. He takes her to the hospital with the intention to charge her for robbing a local grocery store. When Tory awakens, she claims that she was a kidnapping victim, but does not know the names of the men that were in the van. Roan does not want to believe her, but he cannot exactly arrest her either.Two unknown men try to break into the hospital. Roan knows that Tory is no longer safe there and invites her to stay at his house until she can identify the kidnappers. Of course, Tory is not exactly telling the truth. She is running away from her evil ex-fianc&eacute;e and her stepfather, who are both after her inheritance. As a romance blossoms between Roan and Tory, she wonders if she can tell him the truth. However, she may not have a choice as her ex arrives in town for her.My mom use to read a lot of Jennifer Blake when I was growing up, so I instantly recognized the author's name when I glanced at the "new" book section at my local library. I have never read a book by her before, but the jacket sleeve blurb caught my interests. The author does have a niche for the romance genre and her writing walks around the typical romance clich&eacute;. Roan is a fast-paced romantic thriller from start to finish. I recommend it to all readers.

This 2003 film starring Billy Bob Thornton, Lauren Graham, and the late great comedians John Ritter and Bernie Mac is one the raunchiest Christmas movies ever released. I own Badder Santa, the uncut version of the film, and despite a few crude minutes, I always find myself laughing all the way through it. Trust me, it's not a family movie, but it is one my favorites to watch every year.

During the height of its popularity, the series aired a primetime movie titled Hawaiian Style Vacation during the fourth season. The movie is missing from the seasons 3 & 4 set, but Liongates later released the movie along with Wedding in Las Vegas on a single disc. The Hawaiian Style is set during the summer in between season three & four, while it actually aired in November 1992. (Note: The movie was actually filmed as wrap-up to the series, but the producers ordered a fifth batch of episodes in which Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen didn't return for.)The plot involves the Bayside gang going to Hawaii to visit Kelly's grandfather, played by Dean Jones, but they soon find out that her grandfather's hotel business is going under due to a new resort taking all the business. He is going to loose the property if he doesn't get some tourists to check in. Of course, the gang helps out by conning a group of principles, including their own Mr. Belding, into checking out of the resort and checking into the hotel. Due to the fact that there is no staff, the gang fills in as the staff.I had forgotten how the movie went, as I probably haven't seen it in at least fifteen years. The plot reminds me of the 1939 classic Blondie Takes a Vacation. There's also a side-story in Hawaiian Style involving Zack falling in love with an older single mother. Hawaiian Vacation actually stands out from the series with its clever writing.After the short lived series Saved by the Bell: The College Years was cancelled, Wedding in Las Vegas served as the series finale for the original Saved by the Bell cast. I recall watching the movie when it aired on October 7, 1994, but I don't think I ever rewatched it until last week, so the movie was kind of new to me.The movie is centered on Zack and Kelly getting married in Las Vegas. They only have $1,200 dollars to spend on it, but after Zack gets caught speeding, he no longer has any money. As soon as they arrive, Zack and Screech get odd jobs, but then they end up as male escorts as they try to raise the wedding money. Meanwhile, Slater gets involve with Carla, whose ex-boyfriend is a mobster. The whole gang get involved in a jewel heist, but of course everything ends happily ever after for Zack and Kelly.Wedding in Las Vegas gives the Saved by the Bell fans a proper farewell along with a couple of cameos by old cast-members during the wedding ceremony. Overall, I enjoyed watching both movies and I recommend the DVD to other fans.

I've only seen a few musicals, so I was a little skeptical about reviewing Classic Musicals, but the majority of the films have other things going on for them with an occasional song and dance routine thrown into the mix. The fifty movies (on twelve double-sided discs) are from the years 1920s through to 1962; some of the films have aged a lot over the years, while others still look and sound great.One my favorite from this set is the 1946 film Up in the Air starring Frankie Darro, Marjorie Reynolds, and. Mantan Moreland. A string of murders have occurred at a local radio station. The victims are some of the most unpopular singers and performers from the radio station. A page boy and his janitor friend decided to investigate the murders themselves, while an aspiring young singer fill in for one of the victims. There are few singing scenes, but mostly it is an interesting mystery running only sixty minutes.The other forty-nine movies are: The Fabulous Dorseys (1947); Calendar Girl (1947); Sunny (1941); Swing Hostess (1944); Dixiana (1930); Palooka (1934); Glorifying the American Girl (1929); Check and Double Check (1933); Paradise in Harlem (1939); The Duke is Tops (1938); Reet, Petite and Gone (1947); Killer Diller (1948); Delightfully Dangerous (1945); Private Buckaroo (1942); Stage Door Canteen (1943); Career Girl (1944); Second Chorus (1940); Trocadero (1944); People Are Funny (1946); Doll Face (1946); The Great Gabbo (1929); Sing, Cowboy, Sing (1937); Road Show (1941); Hi Diddle Diddle (1943); Rock, Rock, Rock (1956); King Kelly of the USA (1934); Rock N'Roll Revue (1955); Rhythm and Blues Revue (1955); Till The Clouds Roll By (1946); All-American Co-Ed (1941); Hi-De-Ho (1943); Breakfast in Hollywood (1946); Soundies Festival (1945); Soundies Cavalcade (1945); Reaching For The Moon (1930); Mr. Imperium (1951); Royal Wedding (1951); The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1958); Wild Guitar (1962); Murder with Music (1941); Jack and the Beanstalk (1952); The Road to Hollywood (1946); The Big Show (1936); Black Tights (1962); Fiesta (1941); Let's Go Collegiate (1941); Minstrel Man (1944); Rhythm in the Clouds (1947); and Sitting On The Moon (1936).I had a lot of fun watching some of these timeless classics. Mill Creek Entertainment has put together a great collection of films for your entire family to enjoy. None of the movies have been digital remastered, but all of the movies that I watched seemed to have a decent picture quality to them. With Christmas only a few months away, this collection would make a great gift!Disclaimer - I received a free review copy from Tower PR in exchange for an honest review.

Garfield returns in his first full CGI Movie and it is a disappointment! I like the overall plot of Garfield coming out of the comics and into the real word, but the script is a little slow. Garfield is now voiced by the talented Frank Welker and all the supporting characters resemble their comic strip counterparts unlike the two live movies.The movie isn't great, but I still enjoyed it.

Mostly Ghostly is a direct-to-DVD movie based on the short-lived book series by R.L. Stine, the author of the popular Goosebumps series and Fear Street Series.The story centers around a 11-year-old named Max, who loves anything to do with magic, which bothers his Dad (played by David DeLuise) who is a major sports fan. Max has a major crush on an older classmate Traci (played by Ali Lohan), but he can never get the nerve to talk to her.While Max is in his basement he hears voices that lead him to a hidden tunnel to a ghost world, which is only accessed on Halloween. He finds two ghost kids Nicky and Tara (Madison Pettis) who use to live in Max's house. They don't have any memory of who they are or how they died. Max must help them to remember and battle a nasty ghoul ( played by Brian_Stepanek) that is determined to destroy the children.This is the one book series that I have never read by R.L. Stine, so I have no idea if the movie goes by the book. Mostly Ghostly is not a bit scary, has a low-budget, and a few bad actors like Ali Lohan! Despite being a Universal movie, it felt more like a Disney production because of all the Disney Channel stars that appear in it. I enjoyed the parents the most played by David DeLuise and Kim Rhodes. It's not a horrible movie as I think younger kids will enjoy watching it, but some adults may find it a bit boring.

I never saw Blossom during its original run. I only started watching it when it went into syndication and aired in the late afternoons. Shout! Factory released the first two seasons on a six discs set back in 2009, in which I was thrilled to be able to see the quirky comedy again.The original pilot aired in July of 1990 on NBC as a special and served as a backdoor pilot. Thanks to impressive ratings, the series was picked up, aired its first season in January 1991, and ran for five seasons, ending on May 22, 1995.Mayim Bialik (The Big Bang Theory) played the teenager Blossom Russo who wore crazy clothes and wild hats, as well as her best friend Six (played by Jenna von Oy), who talks nonstop. Her singer mother abandoned her and her two older brothers, the ex-drug addict Anthony (played by Michael Stoyanov) and the simple minded Joey (played go Joey Lawrence). Their struggling musician father, Nick (played by Ted Wass), raises them all.The series dealt with typical teenager issues, normally adding a bit a humor to go along it. During each episode, Blossom would tape a video diary, aka a pre-blogger.The episodes in this set are:Disc One - Blossom Blossoms, My Sister's Keeper, Dad's Girlfriend, Who's In Charge Here?, Sex Lies and Teenagers, I Ain't Got No BuddyBonus Features: The Blossom "Pilot"Disc Two - Thanks For The Memorex, The Geek, Tough Love, Such A Night, School Daze, Papa's Little Dividend, Love StinksDisc Three - Second Base, Here Comes the Buzz?, The Joint, I'm With The Band, Honor?, To Tell The Truth, InterventionDisc Four - Run For The Border, Blossom - A Rockumentary, Expectations, You Can't Go Home, This Old House, It's A Marginal Life, The TestDisc Five - Hot For Teacher, Three O'Clock and All Is Hell, Losers Win, The Letter, Wake Up Little Susie, You Must Remember This, House GuestsDisc Six - Whines and Misdemeanors, Driver's Education, Spring FeverBonus Features: A Very Special Show, A Very Special Style, and A Very Special Friendship.Even after all these years, Blossom is still a likeable sitcom. I always enjoyed the episodes with the grandpa Buzz (played by the late Barnard Hughes). I am still hoping that Shout! Factory will bring out the other three seasons in the near future.

Here are three spooky episodes from the Goosebumps series.In Attack of the Jack-O-Lanterns, a group of kids plan on scaring a couple of kids that always plays pranks on them, but they weren't aware of the aliens in town.Freddy and Cara stumble upon a secret room in Vampire Breath which contains a real vampire. I like the twisted ending to this one.Let's Get Invisible has Max and Noah stumbling upon an old mirror that turns you invisible. The more the kids play around with the mirror, the less chances they have of surviving.I love the Jack-O-Lantern cover on this DVD.

Just like the cover, b-movies are the basic plot and feel of the series. After a terrible accident happened in the Riverdale's High School lab, strange things happen in the small town. Archie Andrews is a reporter for the school newspaper. He investigates every mystery along with his friends, Jughead Jones and Dilton Doliey, his girlfriends, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge, and his frenemy, Reggie Mantle. Yes, I said girlfriends, as both Betty and Veronica are both in love with Archie.Some of the b-movie themes are: aliens, a werewolf, a cursed mummy, a 50-foot Veronica, a ghost, creatures, and Veronica clones. In Invisible Archie, both Reggie and Archie turn invisible after a lab accident, which is a spoof of The Invisible Man movies. Most of the episodes play homage to old scifi and horror movies. My favorite was Attack of the Killer Spuds, a spoof of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but instead of pods the aliens use potatoes.The Archie gang has a new modern day look to them, but all the old gags are still there, including Jughead's love of hamburgers and Veronica is still spoiled. As a b-movie fan and cartoon fan, I enjoyed watching these weird episodes and I recommend the DVD to other fans too.

Sure, its not as stylish as the original movie, but Boondock Saints II flows more like a mainstream Hollywood film with less jumping from scene to scene, plus it is easier to follow the storyline.I bought the movie along with the first for five dollars each at my local Walmart. I liked it slightly more than the first one thanks to Julie Benz as the sexy FBI agent and the twist at the very end. I hope that there will be a third installment, but not with a ten year gap.

Van Damme plays Marcus Ray, a salesman for V SIX jeans, in the 1998's Knock Off, which also stars Rob Schneider as his business partner, Tommy Hendricks. While trying to get away from the CIA, whom is on to their counterfeiting jeans scheme, they get caught up in another scheme as the Russian Mafia is smuggling dangerous weapons into the black market.Knock Off is one of the worst plotted action movies that I have ever seen. There is no chemistry between Van Damme and Schneider. That being said, there are a few good action scenes that did keep me interested until the end.

Set in Detroit in 1959, sixteen-year-old Alex Houseman is still dealing with the fact that his mother left his father for another man and took his young brother, Howard, with her. Since his parents divorce, his father has been working the night shift at the local Chevy Plant and has become an alcoholic. Alex has been getting in all sorts of trouble. Most recently he has started skipping school and he just stolen his fourteenth car. He gets caught and is sent to a juvenile detention center.The Car Thief was originally published back in 1972 and was re-released earlier this year. I received a free ARC of the book several months, but the book got shoved around and I just finish reading it today. The book started out slow for me, despite the fact that it is beautifully written, but eventually the story grabbed a hold of me. I kept thinking about how Alex reminded me of myself when I was that age. I didn't get arrested or thrown into a detention center, but I felt lost and confused as Alex was.Since the book is forty years old, so I'm surprised that I have never heard about it before. I don't want to give away too much of the actually plot, but it is a coming-of-age story, reminding me of the classic The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. The book is primarily written for male readers, but some women may enjoy the book too. Overall, I enjoyed reading The Car Thief, which in my opinion the book should be a must-read for high school students. I recommend other readers to read The Car Thief.

Teen years ago, fourteen disappearances occurred at a small town, including the young son of Dwayne Hooper. On the anniversary of his son's disappearance, Dwayne suspects that a jail inmate, Ronald Perkins, is responsible. Dwayne sends one of his deputies to investigate Perkin's house, but unleashes the fourteen people from a cellar, all whom are now zombie-like-killers!This is the worst movie in the After Dark Horrorfest III. The acting is average for a horror movie, but the pacing is too slow, the makeup effects are horrible, and the dialogue is laughable. I forgot to mention about the countless plot holes! The cops in the movie are unbelievable! Hooper's daughter is a teenager, but I find it odd that she is dating a guy that is probably in his thirties and Hooper doesn't care! I know other reviewers hated the ending, but it didn't bother me one bit as I didn't like any of the characters.

Mr. Tall, Snake boy, a wolfman, Alexander Ribs and Mr. Crepsley.Mr. Crepsley is pale faced, redheaded man. He is a real vampire and the owner of Madam Octa, a spider. Darren loves spiders and steals Madam Octa. This causes a chain of events that will forever change Darren's life.

In this crossover trilogy, Justin Russo wins his family a cruise on the S.S. Tipton from an essay contest. Alex magically brings Harper with them, as Justin and Max drool over London Tipton. Alex hangs out with Zack and Cody while Hannah Montana arrives on deck. Hannah loses her lucky charm and everyone tries to help her find it.The episodes on the DVD are:Wizards of Waverly Place - Cast-Away (To Another Show)Suite Life on Deck - Double CrossedHannah Montana - Super (Stitious) GirlI only bought this DVD because of the Wizard of Waverly Place episode, though I do like Suite Life on Deck too. I never cared much for Hannah Montana, due to the bad scripts and acting, but I tolerated the last episode just because of the guest stars from the other two series.

I bought 12 Power Rounds, which is part of the Tae Bo Power Workout series, on Ebay last year, but I didn't get around to actually doing it until tonight for a last minute workout. Including the warm up and cool down is about twenty minutes in length involving, just as the title says 12 rounds of punching, combos, knee raises, but no kicking. Its not the most challenging workout, but if you are in a hurry, you can breakout in a sweat.

Mill Creek Entertainment has recently released the 100 Greatest Sci-Fi Classics to DVD which consists of two previously released sets,SciFi Classics 50 Movie Pack CollectionandSci-Fi Invasion - 50 Movie Setat the retail price of $44.98.Even though I grew up watching Sci-Fi movies, I have never of heard of most of the titles on either sets.The Movies on Sci-Fi Invasion are the following:Disc 1 -Brain Twisters, The Head, The Day Time Ended, Eyes Beyond the StarsDisc 2 - Hands of Steel, War of the Robots, 984: Prisoner of the Future, Top LineDisc 3 - Night Fright, Slipstream, Extraterrestrial Visitors, Star KnightDisc 4 - Invaders From Space, The Alien Factor, Hyper Sapien: People From Another Star, Escape From Galaxy 3Disc 5 - Welcome to Blood City, It's Alive, Future Hunters, The Creeping TerrorDisc 6 - Trapped by Television, Rocket Attack U.S.A., Hundra, Mission StardustDisc 7 - The Gypsy Moon, The Brother From Another Planet, Battle Beyond The Sun, Primal ImpulseDisc 8 - Morons From Outer Space, Alien Prey, Future Women, Star PilotDisc 9 - Assassin, Fugitive Alien, Beyond the Moon, The Crater Lake MonsterDisc 10 - Raiders of Atlantis, Robo Vampire, Horror High, GalaxinaDisc 11 - Night of the Blood Beast, The Manster, Evil Brain From Outer Space, The Bat, Life ReturnsDisc 12 - The Giant of Metropolis, R.O.T.O.R., Death Machines, Abraxas - Guardian of the Universe, Silver Needle in the SkyThis set features classics, aliens, and a few horror movies, such as the cult classic Horror High about a teenage version of Dr. Jeckel & Mr. Hyde. The movie was released in 1974 to mainly drive-ins; despite being PG the movie is actually bloody. In The Day Time Ended (which is produced by Charles Band), a normal family is visited by alien beings, and these beings transports the family's home to prehistoric times. My favorite is Future Hunters starring Robert Patrick (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Linda Carol, who play a young couple who are given the Spear of Destiny by a man from the year 2025. The spear happens to the exact one that was used on Christ at the Crucifixion. If it falls into the wrong hands the world is doomed.The movies on the Sci-Fi Classics set are:Disc 1, Side A - The Incredible Petrified World, Queen of the Amazons, Moon of the WolfDisc 1, Side B - She Gods of Shark Reef, The Amazing Transparent Man, The Atomic BrainDisc 2, Side A - Horros of Spider Island, The Wasp Women,Disc 2, Side B - Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet, Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric WomenDisc 3, Side A - Kong Island, Bride of the Gorilla,Disc 3, Side B - Attack of the Monsters, Gamera the InvincibleDisc 4, Side A - Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, Teenagers from Outer SpaceDisc 4, Side B - Rocky Jones, Space Ranger: Crash of the Moons, Rocky Jones, Space Ranger: Menace From Outer SpaceDisc 5, Side A - Hercules Against the Moon Men, Hercules and the Captive WomenDisc 5, Side B - Hercules and the Tyrants of Babylon, Hercules UncahinedDisc 6, Side A - The Lost Jungle, Mesa of Lost Women,Disc 6, Side B - Assignment: Outer Space, Laser MissionDisc 7, Side A - Killers From Space, Phantom From SpaceDisc 7, Side B - White Pongo, The Snow CreatureDisc 8, Side A - Son of Hercules: The Land of Darkness, Giants of RomeDisc 8, Side B - First Spaceship of Venus, The Alpha IncidentDisc 9, Side A - The Astral Factor, The Galaxy InvaderDisc 9, Side B - Snowbeast, Unknown WorldDisc 10, Side A - Blood Tide, The Brain MachineDisc 10, Side B - The Wild Women of Wongo, Prehistoric WomenDisc 11, Side A - They Came From Beyond Space, Warning From SpaceDisc 11, Side B - The Phantom Planet, Planet OutlawsDisc 12, Side A - Colossus and the Amazon Queen, Eegah,Disc 12, Side B - Cosmos: War of the Planets, Destroy All Planets.The first movie I watched on this set was the cheesy 1959 Teenagers from Outer Space because I had seen about twenty minutes of it late at night before and I was curious at how the silly movie ended. There are four fun Hercules movies; well I guess there are five if you count the Son of Hercules: The Land of Darkness. I have to mention one of the worst movies every put to film is on here, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.The 100 Greatest Sci-Fi Classic movies have never been restored, therefore some of the picture quality is VHS quality, but for the price, I doubt this will change someone's mind about buying the set. I highly recommend the set to B-Movie fans.Disclaimer - I received a free review copy from Tower PR in exchange for an honest review.

The lazy orange and black stripe cat is back in a new series titled The Garfield Show.The six 11 minutes episodes are:Mother Garfield - Garfield is forced to babysit some bird eggs until the mother returns.Desperately Seeking Pooky - Garfield tries to save his beloved Pooky after the toy is stolen by a chihuahua named Hercules.Meet the Parents - Jon is meeting his girlfriend's parents who happen to bring along the family canary.Pet Matchers - Garfield and Jon get a chance to be on a reality TV show.Family Pictures - Jon wants to give a picture of him with his pets, Garfield and Odie, to give to his girlfriend but everything and everyone gets in the way.Iceman - A criminal steals the ice cream lady's purse and it is up to Garfield to save the day.Each episode airs two 11 minutes shows, but here we only get six 11 minute episodes. It would have been nice if we got the full 22 minutes, but I'll take what I can get as I'm a Garfield fan. The shows are cute enough for kids and funny enough for adults!

Monster House is based on the hit animated movie. You get to play as DJ, Chowder, or Jenny as they investigate the spooky old house that is actually alive. I'm surprised to read several bad reviews on the game. The fact is Monster House is aimed toward younger kids and not teenagers and adults.The game has great graphics and a scary atmosphere. Is it challenging? Maybe for younger kids, but teens and adults will find it easy to get through in a few hours.Overall, it's actually a fun game to play!

The original 1937 version of Miracle on 34th Street is one of the best Christmas movies ever made. It's played every December multiple times, but normally in the added color version, which ruins the film for me. It had been a few years since I seen the movie as my VHS version died years ago, but I ended up buying it on DVD, which includes the b&w and the colorized version, along with the 1955 TV-remake. Yes, the movie does gives the message that Santa is real, which may bother some people, but it is a harmless film that has great actors and dialogue.

Now cured of the vampire curse, Barnabas is ready to start a new live as a mortal, starting by furthering his relationship with his savior Dr. Julia Hoffman. He is now living in the Collinwood estate and plans on becoming a productive member of the family. The night before the demolition crew is scheduled to tear down the Old House, he returns there just before a mysterious fire occurs, burning down almost the entire house. The only item that survived the burning was a journal. The journal of the witch Angelique Bouchard.Despite of Julia's demands for him to toss the book into the fireplace, Barnabas begins reading the haunted tale that takes place on island of Martinique. At a young age Angelique is ripped from her mother's arms and forced to live with her father, a plantation owner. Voodoo witchcraft had been in her family line and at an early age her father recognized it in her. Angelique is treated more like a slave than a daughter as she is used in her father's scheme to control his slaves, leading her into pledging her soul to darkness and becoming immortal.Angelique's early life is one with heartache and bloodshed. She escapes her father's clutches and eventually ends up as a maidservant to Josette du Pres, Barnabas's lost love.Barnabas becomes obsessed in reading the journal after he realizes he had met the Angelique at a young age but at the time he didn't know her name. The property of the Old House has been sold. Barnabas is in shock when he meets the new owner Antoinette, who resembles Angelique.Angelique's Descent was original released in 1998, followed by Dark Shadows: Dreams of Dark written by Elizabeth Massie and Stephen Mark Rainey, the latter is currently out-of-print. Angelique's Descent was re-released this year, as well as its sequel The Salem Branch, due to the remake being released on Friday. The author Lara Parker, who played the original Angelique, has nicely created a back-story to the witch, which explains where she came from before falling in love with Barnabas Collins, and eventually cursing him into a vampire. The book is a little darker and more erotic than the series ever was and should satisfy most old fans while introducing new fans to the character.

For reason instead of releasing TMNT Season 3 in one complete set, LionGates released it in four volumes (3-6). Probably because there were 47 episodes that aired during the 1989 season.The episodes on this single disc volume are:The Turtle TerminatorThe Great BoldiniThe Missing MapThe Gang's All HereThe GrybyxMr. Ogg Goes to TownShreddervilleBye, Bye FlyThe Big Rip-offThe Big Break-InThe Big Blow-OutPlan 6 From Outer SpaceFinally we get the final twelve episodes from season three of one of my favorite cartoons from when I was a kid.

In the mail at the end of last week was The Garfield Show: Summer Adventures. Even though I am over thirty years old, I am still a Garfield fan. I grew up on the Saturday Morning Garfield & Friends cartoon and I now own them on DVD. I was disappointed with the two live/CGI movies and I had mixed feeling about the three direct-to-DVD computer animated movies. The Garfield Show is actually made in France and it airs in the United States on the Cartoon Network. At first I was a little skeptical about the new computerized animation, but after a few episodes I got use to it. Frank Welker, who voiced the fat cat in the three animated movies, returns for the new series. Unlike the movies, it follows a similar format to Garfield & Friends, minus the U.S. Acres; with normally two eleven minutes episodes.In the newest release titled Summer Adventures, Garfield and his friends stumble upon a pot of gold in Lucky Charms; Garfield tries to save his favorite pizza place in Perfect Pizza; Garfield goes to a strange theme park in It's a Cheese World; John sends Garfield to a pet school in Extreme Housebreaking; Garfield takes on a new mailman in Mailman Blues; Garfield becomes a superhero in Super Me; and in the bonus episode Fame Fatale, Garfield switches places with a famous cat.What disappoints me with The Garfield Show DVDs is that they only have six to seven 11 minute episodes. I wish they would just release a full season set. I understand that their main target is kids, and in this economy parents would rather buy a $10 dollar cartoon than a $40 one.The Garfield Show: Summer Adventures is a great DVD to own for Garfield fans and a great way to introduce kids to Garfield.

I've always been a big Garfield fan and so was a lot of other people of all ages. A Garfield Christmas special aired in 1987 when I was a six-year-old. The plot involved Jon dragging Garfield and Odie to his family's farm for Christmas, where Garfield learns the true meaning of giving. It aired annually on CBS for many years, but has now disappeared from television. Thankfully, all of the Garfield specials have been released to DVD for old and new fans to watch again and again.

After a brief hiatus, R.L. Stine returned to his "Fear Street" series with book one in a new trilogy back in 2005. Lewis, Jamie, Nate and other teenagers begin sneaking out at night - giving them the freedom to do anything the want. They hang out at the old Fear mansion that is soon to be demolished. The mansion is said to be cursed by the spirit of Angelic Fear. One night the kids discover a hidden room filled with valuables. They steal several of the objects.A year passes by and the Fear Mansion has been torn down. Several shopping stores have been built over the ruins, including a bar called "Nights." The bar stays open late at night and serves beer to the teens. Strange accidents soon occur, and it eventually ends up with one of the teens being murdered. Is the curse of Angelic Fear true?I grew up reading the "Fear Street" series. I quit reading them in the late 90's when I could no longer find in the stores. After I did some research online, I found out that there are dozens of "Fear Street" books that I don't have. In 2005, I was looking forward to this new series, but I could never find them at my local Walmart or at the Barnes & Nobles in the city. I never thought about the books again, until late one night I typed in "Fear Street" in the search engine at Overstock.com. That's were I found the "Fear Street Nights" trilogy. "Moonlight Secrets" is under 200 pages and is an easier and faster read than the new supernatural style teen books that are out today. There's not very many thrills in the first book. It mostly just introduces the characters and sets everything up for the second and third books. Fans of the original series will get a kick out of the return of Simon and Angelic Fear.

A year has passed since the events in "Moonlight Secrets." The night people are still recovering from the death of one of their own. Jamie's cousin, Dana Fear, arrives in Shadyhigh. Dana is going to finish high school there. And yes, Dana is a descendant of the Fear family.Dana starts hanging out with the night people - a group of teenagers who hang out at 3a.m.. She befriends Nate, who is still getting over Candy's death in "Moonlight Secrets." Strange events start to occur, and the body count rises. Is Angelic Fear back from the dead?"Midnight Games" is a fun, fast-paced sequel. There are more screams and scares than the previous installment. It was clever to bring in Dana Fear, as she is connected to Simon and Angelic Fear. I can't wait to read the final book.

Several months have passed since "Midnight Games," and the night people have gone on with their lives, no longer in fear of Angelic Fear. Jamie is the only one who still believes that the curse lives on. She still has nightmares of being possessed by Angelic Fear. She runs across a mysterious bracelet that is similar to the Fear amulet.More deaths start to the occur. Jamie's cousin, Dana, starts to wonder if she has lost her mind. After awhile Jamie starts to wonder the same thing, especially after she starts seeing the Fear Mansion that was demolished over a year ago. Is it Angelic Fear back from the grave again? Or is it someone else?Jamie becomes the main character in "Darkest Dawn," the third and final book in the "Fear Street Night" trilogy. Die-hard fans from the original books will enjoy the continuation and conclusion to the Simon and Angelic Fear storyline. I was disappointed that the character Dana Fear didn't have a bigger part. She is a much stronger and likeable character than Jamie. The plot is a little darker than the first two books. Overall, I did enjoy the exciting ending to the series.

I grew up watching The X-File and when I found the X-Files: Resist or Serve at a local dollar store for ten dollars, I had to buy it. Some of the graphics aren't the best, but the intriguing horror storyline makes up for it. A player can either plays Agent Mulder or Agent Scully as you investigate a strange town filled with zombie & creatures. There's plenty of blood and violence, but I only wished there was a difficult level as I went through the game in one night. Overall, I'm satisfied with the game.

Snow River: The McGregor Saga ignores the two Disney movies and is more based on the poem. The series was filmed in Australia and it aired on here in the states on the Family Channel, known now as ABC Family. I recall watching it as a kid on the weekends. Sadly, The USA DVD releases have been lazy, releasing only a handful of episodes. Here is the pilot movie called "The Race" which had an American showing up on the McGregor farm claiming to be a long loss nephew, who happens to have an agenda against the family. It's great first episode (well actually it is episode one and two wrapped into one).

Live Animals is about a group of young adults who are kidnapped and tortured by a group of psychos, who plan on selling them to the highest bidder. The movie is a ripoff of the Hostel movies and the Saw films. It has a low-budget, bad acting, and plot holes every two minutes. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Reva Dalby is a pretty, spoiled, rich kid. She is spending her Christmas vacation working at her father's department store. She is rude to the customers and the other works. She does not care about anyone but herself. In other words - she is a scrooge.Pam Dalby, Reva's cousin, and her friends, Clay and Mickey, is planning to rob the department store. They are only planning to take a few merchandise items. However, something goes terribly wrong with their plan. A security guard is killed and the money from the store's vault is missing.Now Reva is caught up in the mystery.Silent Night has two main characters that it flips back and forth from. Reva is a perfect example of a true-life-scrooge; Pam is the perfect example of someone who hangs out with the wrong crowd. The murder mystery plot is cleverly written and you do not know who the actually killer is until the ending. Overall, this is a great book to read.

For the past twenty-seven years, one of my annual Halloween watches is the little known horror comedy The Midnight Hour. It first aired on ABC on November 1, 1985 (Yep, one day after Halloween and two days after Garfield's Halloween Adventure aired on CBS) when I was a four-year-old. At the time my parents and I lived in a two-story farmhouse in the country (which was also haunted) and my parents recorded it onto a VHS tape. I would pester my mother into letting me watch The Midnight Hour, even though The Elf would always freak me out.The Midnight Hour is set on Halloween in the small town of Pitchford Cove, New England. Five high school seniors, Phil (Lee Montgomery), Mary (Dedee Pfeiffer), Mitch (Peter DeLuise), Vinnie (LeVar Burton), and Melissa (Shari Belafonte), break into the town's museum. They steal (or should I saw "borrow") a few costumes and an old trunk. They open the trunk at the local cemetery, in which they find a mysterious scroll. Melissa reads the scroll aloud, unleashing a horrible curse.A few minutes after the kids leave the cemetery, the undead rise from their graves. The undead's leader is Melissa's own ancestor, Lucinda Cavender, who was put to death over 300 hundred years ago for being a vampire.While little kids are trick-or-treating, the teenagers of Pitchford Cove are attending the costume party at Melissa's house. Phil arrives at the party hoping to get the attention of Mary, who he has a crush on, but Mary already has a date. He leaves just as the undead arrive for the party.On his way home, Phil meets a lost cheerleader named Sandra "Sandy" Matthews. The two share a brief romantic encounter, before a werewolf attacks them. Sandy informs Phil about the town's curse and that he must undo the curse before midnight or the undead will walk forever.The Midnight Hour scared me to death when I was four, but viewing it an adult, it isn't even close to being scary. The movie was briefly released to DVD a few years ago, in which I didn't even know about it, but it is now out of print. A few years back, I dubbed my parents VHS recording onto a DVD with the original commercials intact. The picture quality is good, but I do hope that the movie would be released onto DVD in the near future. What's not to like about the movie? It has vampires, werewolves, and zombies. Yes, there is even a campy dance scene with the undead! There is also a little romance involving Phil and the mysterious Sandy! The Midnight Hour is one of my favorite movies to watch around Halloween!

Released in 1982 when I was one-year-old, the movie picks up a day after the Camp Crystal Lake killings from the second film. Chris Higgins, along with her pals Shelly, Debbie, Andy, Vera, Chuck and Chili, returns to her family cabin, called Higgins Haven, the first time since she was attacked by a disfigured man two years earlier. Already at the cabin is Chris's boyfriend, Rick (who is way to old for her).Shelly (the goofball of the group) and Vera run into a group of bikers briefly. The bikers follow them to the cabin, where the bikers attempted to burn down the barn, but Jason is hiding there and he gets rid of them. While Chris and Rick go out for a drive, one by one Jason slaughters her friends Then he slips on the hockey mask for the first time.I vividly recall watching Friday the 13th part 3 for the first time when I was around eight or nine on a Saturday afternoon. Even though it was heavily cut, I instantly became a fan of the series. Several years ago, around Halloween, my local Walmart had 1 through 8 on DVD for five dollars each. At the time I didn't have the money to buy them, but to my surprise I received the DVDs as a Christmas present from my parents. I take them out and watch them around Friday the 13th or Halloween. The fourth, third, second and sixth movies are my favorites out the series.Part 3 was originally released in 3D, which wasn't technology developed as it is now. The 3D version was released on DVD a few years ago, but I only have the 2D version. The opening credits suffer from it, and there are a few instances where an object is forced toward the audience. I like most of the characters except for Chuck and Chili, the hippies. They're much older than the rest of the group, and they're just there for a death scene. Just like part 2, the 3rd has a long chase scene between the heroine and Jason, in which at times is intense and inspired some of scenes in the remake. In the end, we get the famous axe to the head scene, which was intended to end the series, but instead we got more sequels.

It took long enough for Volume 2 to be released. I'm disappointed that there is no tin case like Volume 1 had, but I'm a true fan of the series and I can overlook it.

The show is still funny with great plots, just as I remembered.The episodes on Volume 2 are:Disc 1:031-"Chicken, He Clucked!"032-"Ragnarok and Roll"033-"Don't Forget The Motor City"034-"Banshee Bake A Cherry Pie"035-"Who's Afraid of The Big Red Ghost!"036-"Hanging By A Thread"037-"You Can't Take It With You"Disc 2:038-"No One Comes to Lupusville"039-"Drool, The Dog-Faced Goblin"040-"The Man Who Never Reached Home"041-"The Collect Call of Cathulhu"042-"Bustman's Holiday"043-"The Headless Motorcyclist"044-"The Thing in Mrs. Faversham's AtticDisc 3:045-"Egon the Rampage"046-"Lights!

I have never been into playing Star Wars games, but Battlefront II is amazing. You get to play as a Jedi or Stormtrooper, where you are thrown into the middle of the clone wars. This game is not easy to play, it is very challenging, but fun to play.

In this sequel to Alvin & the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein, Alvin has been watching way too many horror movies and he starts to believe that the new neighbor is a werewolf. Dave and his brothers don't believe him. At school Alvin accidentally makes a mess and loses his part in the school play, which now goes to Theodore. Alvin, along with Simon, try to find evidence that the neighbor is a werewolf. Meanwhile, Theodore begins to act odd after he is bitten by a wolf.It is great to see that the producers used the 80s animation style and the same voices. The movie is cute for all ages.

I actually like Bad Teacher, mostly because I had similar teachers during junior high and love Lucy Punch as the quirky teacher Amy Squirrel. I've watched the movie several times on Starz and I eventually bought Unrated Edition DVD for a $1.96 at a Black Friday sale.Why the three star rating?Bad Teacher is funny at times, but it could have much better. Considering the R rating, I expected it to be more raunchier like more recent comedies, like The Hangover, Bridesmaids, and 21 Jump Street, but instead the writers decided to play it safe. I would have liked to seen more the classroom antics with Cameron Diaz and of course the plot could have been better.Overall, I still like the movie, but it is not the greatest comedy.

In the summer of 1964, two twelve-year-old best friends Cynthia and Augusta (everyone calls her `Gus') decided to explore Cynthia's family attic. Her parents are planning on cleaning it out soon and the girls want to check it out to see if they can find anything they want to keep. The girls come upon an old trunk and are memorized by it. Mysteriously, the girls are swept fifty years into the past, where they try to unravel what happened to Cynthia's great-great Aunt Belle, who vanished years ago without a trace. While on their adventure, the girls take a ride on the seven seas and they must also try to find a locket that was thought to be lost."The Missing Locket" is the first book in the series that follows in the footsteps of the Nancy Drew, and the Boxcar Children. I can't believe I let this book sit around in my eBook reader for several months before making time to read it. Being an amateur genealogist myself, I found the premise of traveling back in time to help your ancestors to be intriguing. Now of days, the tween market is full of "Twilight" clones, so it was a bit of fresh air to find an exciting adventure written for kids that doesn't involve creatures of the night. The main characters are two twelve-year-olds, so I was a bit surprised to see kids at this age to be excited about finding old family heirlooms to be thrilling, but Cynthia's Attic is set in a more simpler time, before cable, cell phones, video games, and the internet. Despite being a mystery with a bit of a science fiction twist, the book offers great humor between the two girls as they try to change the past. I recommend Cynthia's Attic: The Missing Locket to readers of all ages.

Here is another three episode release of Snow River: The McGregor Saga, a western filmed in Australia, but aired in the USA on the former Family Channel, aka ABC Family. Guy Pearce who plays Rob McGregor was busy filming a movie, so a young unknown named Hugh Jackman was written onto the series for five episodes, who happens to take a shine to Rob's so-called girlfriend.The Episodes are:ComebackThe Grand OpeningBlack SheepEven thought I would prefer a complete season release instead of a handful of episodes, I still enjoyed the DVD as I only paid five dollars for it.

Shout! Factory is on a roll by releasing not one but two volumes of R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series - Volume 2 to DVD this month. I grew up reading R.L. Stine's books and over the years I have collected almost every DVD of Goosebumps the series that aired during the mid to late 90s on Fox Kids. Goosebumps had a low-budget that resulted in bad acting, cut-down scripts based on the books, and cheap special effects. In other words the series was campy! Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the Goosebumps series for what it was - pure fun.The Haunting Hour seems to be avoiding the flaws in the Goosebumps series by having better actors and directors, higher quality special effects, and complete scripts. Each episode is not based on an entire book but on short stories that appeared in the two anthologies,The Haunting Hour: Chills in the Dead of NightandNightmare Hour: Time for Terror.Here in Volume 2 we get five episodes that aired in early 2011.In The Red Dress, Jamie doesn't have enough to by the dress that she wants to wear to the dance, so she steals the red dress from The Raven's Chest. The store's blind owner (played by Emmanuelle Vaugier) find the girl and the owner wants to be paid, but not in cash!In Ghostly Scares, Lauren likes to visit the cemetery to do grave rubbings and she brings along her brother, Mark, who happens to fall into an open grave and a ghost possesses his body. It is up to Lauren to try to get her brother back.Jeffery thinks his new house is strange in The Walls. He starts hearing strange noises from inside the walls and he sees freaky shadows. There is actually a klemit living in the walls that gives the owners good fortune, but this creature has a sweet tooth!You'll think twice about playing a video game in Game Over. A stranger called the Game Master gives Kelly and friend Gooch a video game called Zee Town, but this is not a normal game. They are both brought into the game where they team up with two other teenagers to fight off the zombies.Alien Candy involves two kids, Walt and Tim who are obsessed with aliens. Two new classmates, Greg and Bonnie, invite them to join their alien club, and of course Walt and Tim join. The twist is that Greg and Bonnie are really aliens and Walt and Tim are their next meal.The Haunting Hour airs on The Hub, which I don't get, so I eagerly awaited forR.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Vol.1andR.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Vol.2to be released to DVD. The show is made for kids, but I was instantly hooked into this Twilight Zone type episodes. Ghostly Stare and The Red Dress are my favorites from the volume as they both have really twisted endings. I enjoyed watching the other three as well. With Halloween coming up, this would be a great DVD to watch and get goosebumps!

Jillian is your typically teenager with twin younger sisters, Amanda and Katie. Their dad brought home a doll, which the twins named Mary-Ellen. The doll freaks out Jillian.After taking the twins to see a ventriloquist show, Jillian discovers a wooden dummy in the dumpster. Jillian considers this an opportunity and takes the dummy home. She wants to use Slappy at kids' birthday parties so she can earn some extra money.Strange things start to happen. Has Slappy come to life?This is a great, fun addition to the Goosebumps series. Slappy is one of my favorite characters from the series, and it is great seeing him back in action. In his fourth outing, R.L. Stine has cleverly spoofed the Bride of Frankenstein. It is a great read.

I grew up watching Garfield & Friends and of course the CBS Garfield primetime specials. It took me awhile to get use to The Garfield Show, in which I am starting to like. The Holiday Extravaganza came out of nowhere. I never heard about the DVD being released until I came across it in the store. Since I am a die-hard Garfield fan, I eagerly bought it.The episodes on this disc are:The Haunted House - John is out of idea for a new comic book, so he spends the weekend at Mr. Barker's new mansion, which is haunted by a ghost cat!Which Witch - The annoying twins Druscilla and Minerva are visiting John and Garfield plans on getting rid of them by sending them to a witch's house.Turkey Trouble - Jon wins a turkey through a contest in which he plans on cooking it for Liz, but the turkey isn't frozen, it is alive.Caroling Capers - Garfield goes around the neighbor singing Christmas Carols in exchange for food.Home For The Holidays Part 1 & 2 - At Christmas time Garfield only thinks about himself until Arlene shows him that there is something more meaningful than receiving is giving to others who truly need help.The Haunted House and the Wich Witch aren't set at Halloween, but they do have spooky plots. Turkey Trouble isn't set at Thanksgiving, but it is about a fun loving turkey. The other three episodes are set during Christmas! These are a wonderful collection of Garfield tales that kids will enjoy watching around the holidays.I also recommendGarfield Show: Spooky TailsandGarfield: Holiday Celebrations (Garfield's Halloween Adventure / Garfield's Thanksgiving / A Garfield Christmas)!

After reviewing Saved by the Bell back in August, I couldn't get the silly theme song out of my head. I used a $15.00 coupon code given to me by Mommy Bear Media (where you can find family-friendly movies and television series) along with my own money to buy Saved by the Bell Seasons Three & Four. I also bought the Saved by the Bell: Double Feature Two Movies set that features the two made-for-television movies, Hawaiian Style and Wedding in Las Vegas.I was hooked on Saved by the Bell when I was a kid, but I think every kid in the early 90s watching it. The first & second DVD set went by the syndication order and not the original airdate. The episode order in the season 3 & 4 is worse than the previous. Yes, Lionsgate once again went by the syndication order, but there are a few two part episodes that have another episode in between them. The episodes at the summer resort are randomly mixed in with the Bayside High episodes for discs 1-3. The continuity error doesn't bother me too much, but it could become a problem for any new fan of the series.The series actually aired for four seasons, but the production filmed five different batches, aka five seasons.The episodes are:Disc One - The Famous Belding Boys; Breaking Up is Hard to Do; The Glee Club; The Last Dance; Zack's Birthday Party; The AftermathDisc Two - The Game; Operation Zack; Fourth of July; Wicked Stepbrother part 1; Wicked Stepbrother part 2; Check Your MateDisc Three - My Boyfriend's Back; Fake IDs; Boss Lady; Pipe Dreams; The Last Weekend; Date Auction; All in the MallDisc Four - S.A.T.'s; Palm Springs Weekend Part 1; Hold Me Tight; Palm Springs Weekend Part 2; No Hope With Dope; Rockumentary; Cut Day; Home for Christmas Part 1; Home for Christmas Part 2; Mystery WeekendMajor highlights during the season are the breakup of Zack and Kelly, the breakup of Slater and Jesse, the six summer episodes at the resort, and the two-part Palm Springs episodes. The plots are better in seasons 3 & 4, though Screech becomes less of a nerd and more of a goofball sidekick. My favorite is the two-part Christmas episode that use to air on TBS every holiday season up until a few years ago. Despite the order errors, I enjoyed watching the DVD set.

The Smurfs and the Magic Flute was directed by the Smurfs creator Peyo and was released to theaters in 1976 in Belgium, and 1979 in the United Kingdom. In 1981, NBC aired The Smurfs from Hanna-Barbera and it was an instant success. An English dubbed version of The Smurfs and the Magic Flute came out to theaters in the USA in 1983. Despite being disliked by critics, the move was a box-office success. Over the years it has been only available on VHS, but never on DVD, until now.The movie centers on a young squire, Johan, and his goofy sidekick, Peewit, (Peyo created the characters in 1952 and then created the Smurfs in 1958). Peewit gets a hold of a flute that has only six holes. Whoever is playing the flute can control other people by making them dance.A stranger, Matthew McCreep, steels the flute from Peewit and uses the flute to rob people. The King sends Johan and Peewit to retrieve the flute or their kingdom may fall. They fail at their first attempt to get the flute back, causing them to seek the help of a wizard who magically sends them to Smurfland.Papa Smurf and the other Smurfs agree to make a new flute for them. Before the Smurfs can hand them the flute, Johan and Peewit are zapped back to their world. The Smurfs journey to the other world to help stop McCreep before he takes over the castle.Shout! Factory has brought The Smurfs and the Magic Flute to DVD, but they used the UK Dubbed version and not the English Dubbed version for some odd reason. So the voices are different, and the names have been changed, such as Peewit is now William and Johan is now John! The picture quality is pretty good, up until the ending. There are a few extras - image gallery, glossary of Smurf terms, The Smurf Story, character guide, etc.This is not the best animated movie I have ever seen. It takes forever for a Smurf to actually show up! I can only recommend the movie to Smurf fans and new fans may not appreciate it for what it is.

I remember watching Garfield's Halloween Adventure every year at Halloween, until CBS decided to quit airing it. Luckily, my parents recorded it onto VHS when it first originally aired. Sadly, the DVD only has the edited version and is missing a few scenes.CBS also quit airing A Garfield Christmas, which is one of the best animated Holiday specials ever made.For some reason, I must have missed a Garfield's Thanksgiving when it originally aired, but I enjoy it now on DVD.

Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors Volume 1 is another DVD that I won in a recent giveaway. I didn't recognize the name or the cover art. It wasn't until I played the first episode that I finally, more like vaguely, remembered the show, as I was a four-year-old when it aired on television. Actually, I don't recall much about the show, but I do the toys, which were released by Mattel before the show was created. Mattel needed a way to explain the strange looking silver vehicles and the even stranger looking organic/machine vehicles, thus Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors was created. Talented writes such as Larry DiTillio, Barbara Hambly and J. Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, wrote most the episodes.Here is the series main plot: Audric, a botanist, was experimenting with biotechnology, and developed a crop that could grow in any environment. A burst of radiation from a solar flare mutated one of his crops, transforming it an evil creature called Saw Boss. The other plants transformed as well and were called the Monster Minds. Audric created a magic root to destroy Saw Boss, but time was not on his side as his laboratory is being attacked. He splits the magical root in half and gives the other half of it to his faithful servant, Oon. He commands Oon to take the root to his son, Jayce, and serve under his command.Oon (a magically animated suit of armor servant) finds Jacye along with Gillian (a wizard/scientist), and Flora, who was created from a flower by Audric. With the help of a Han Solo ripoff character, Herc Stormsailor - a pilot and mercenary, they become known as the Lightning League. They use their ground vehicles to battle the Monster Minds vehicles, that are grown from vines. The Lightning League travels to planet to planet by the Pride of the Skies II, Herc's space barge, as Jayce searches for his missing father.Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors definitely has that 80s feel to it, along with the catchy pop rock theme song. Obviously, the show had one purpose - sell the toy line. The talented writers took a silly premise and did what they could with it, giving us an original science fiction cartoon. Now thanks to Cookie Jar, a division of Mill Creek Entertainment, old fans can watch the series again and introduce the Lightning League to a new generation. Despite each episode being similar (searching for Jayce's father on a new planet, Saw Boss and his minions show up, and they battle it out with their vehicles. Sadly, the series never got a conclusion as it was cancelled before a movie could go into production. I enjoyed revisiting Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and I can't wait for Volume 2 to be released.

Back in 2003 Fox released four of The Simpsons annual Treehouse of Horror onto DVD. These are great episodes to watch at Halloween, but I wonder why didn't release I-IV first and then release a new volume every year! I know the DVD must sell well as my local Wal-mart carries the DVD around Halloween every year.The episodes are:Treehouse of Horror V - The Shinning, Time and Punishment and Nightmare Cafeteria.Treehouse of Horror VI - Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores, Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace, and Homer 3.Treehouse of Horror VII - The Thing and I, The Genesis Tub, Mr. Kang Goes to WashingtonTreehouse of Horror XII - Hex and the City, House of Whacks, and Wiz KidsFor the price, the DVD is worth buying.

Annually, my local Walmart sets out a few horror/Halloween themed movies. It's not even October and this year's Halloween DVDs/Blu-Rays are already out, in which the majority of them are a mixed bag of good and bad treats. I already own all the good ones and a few that I don't are not my style, but I did pick up Trick `r Treat only because Anna Paquin was on the back cover.Trick 'r Treat was released to one theater in December 2007 followed by a handful of screens in 2008 and 2009, mostly at festivals. The movie was finally released to DVD on October 6, 2009 and received mostly good reviews to the small amount of critics who viewed it.In this anthology in the style of the Creepshow, a short trick-treater, Sam, wearing a worn-out orange pajamas with a burlap sack over his head, keeps popping throughout the movie. Emma (played by Leslie Bibb) and Henry are the couple that opens up the movie. Henry loves the holiday and has over-decorated their yard with ghost-scarecrows. She demands that he cleans up everything on Halloween night, but he says he'll get to it tomorrow, which she knows he is a lying. He goes inside the house while Emma begins to take down the scarecrows and comes face to face with horror.Charlie a trick-or-treater stops by Principle Wilkins house and steals a few pieces of Halloween candy that was on the front porch, but he is in for a shock when the candy turns out to be poisoned. It seems that Principle Wilkins drags Charlie's lifeless body inside. Later that night, he digs a hole in the backyard and tosses Charlie on top of another corpse. He is in a hurry to get the bodies covered up, help out his son carve a unique jack-o-lantern, and get ready for his date.Five pre-teen kids, Macy; Schrader; Sara; Chip; and Rhonda, make their way through town and eventually to the rock quarry. Macy tells the other about the The Halloween School Bus Massacre that took place thirty years ago. It seems that a school bus containing eight mentally challenged children were chained in their seats. Instead of taking them home, the bus driver drives toward the quarry. Let's just say there is an accident and the bus goes over the ravine, killing all the children.The intent of the night was to scare Rhonda, but the others turn the tables on her and pull a prank that scares Macy almost to death. Suddenly out of nowhere, the eight victims come out of the quarry in a zombie-like-state. The kids try to make it to the elevator, but Rhonda locks the door and rides back up to the top while the others are eaten alive.Laurie (played by the lovely Anna Paquin) is pestered by her older sister Danielle and her two friends Maria and Janet, into losing her virginity. Wearing her little red riding hood costume, Laurie is on the look out for the right guy to be her first, while her sister and friends drag a couple of guys to a party out in the woods. Laurie has no luck finding the right guy and begins to walk to the party, but someone is following her. At first she thinks it is a vampire, but it turns out to be Principle Wilkins on the prowl for his date. With no other choice, Laurie settles for Wilkins, revealing her true self in a howling way.An elderly man, Kreeg, hates Halloween with a passion and lives alone in his old house with his dog, Spite. He scares away every trick-or-treater that comes knocking at his door, but tonight there is a surprise for him - Sam! It seems the little guy doesn't like people who disgrace Halloween and he plans on giving Kregg a Halloween that he'll never forget.I paid only four dollars for the DVD, so I wasn't expecting too much from the movie, especially with its short running time at 82 minutes. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually liked it! A few of the main characters and victims are actually children, which gives this Halloween anthology more of a fright. The pint-size Sam is the new Michael Myers! Don't let his height fool you as he doesn't like anyone messing with his holiday. Sam actually first appeared in the animated 1996 short called Season's Greetings which appears as a special feature on the DVD. Trick r' Treat is now one of my "must watch" movies at Halloween! I recommend others to turn off the lights, watch the movie, and enjoy a horrorific Halloween treat!

I happened to be flipping through the channels late one night and came across Wizards of Waverly Place. I new the show existed, but I never tried watching because I don't care today's kids series. After watching a few minutes I was hooked.The episodes on the DVD are:Wizard School Part 1Wizard School Part 2Curb Your DragonDisenchanted EveningThe problem I have with Disney releasing the series to DVD is that they never release full seasons. Typically, they release four to five episodes on DVD at a low price, which can make a great birthday or Christmas gift.Is it just me, or does the wizard school's outfits look a lot like the ones worn in Harry Potter?

I grew up watching Moe, Larry, Curly, and Shemp, so I was more than a little skeptical when I heard about the Farrelly brothers remake (if you can call it a remake). I only saw the movie advertise on television once when it was at theaters and it did not look too good. Then I read a few bad reviews about the movie, making me less likely to go see it. The movie did not do very well at the theaters, barely covering its budget worldwide. I saw the DVD for under fifteen dollars and I talked myself into buying it.The movie opens up with the same Stooges' tune and similar opening credits. The first episode is titled "More Orphan Than Not," which explains the Stooges back-story, where as babies they are left in basket outside of an orphanage. As they grow up and cause chaos for the nuns (played by Jane Lynch, Larry David, and a few others), Moe is almost adopted by a wealthy couple, but they end up adopting another orphan, Teddy, instead. Twenty-five years later, Moe (played by Chris Diamantopoulos), Larry (played by Sean Hayes), and Curly (Will Sasso) have never left the orphanage as they are now handymen, but the home that they have known is going to be closed down as the orphanage owes $830,000 in thirty days.There are two more episodes in the movie, "The Bananas Splits" and "No Moe Mister Nice Guy," in which the trio go to the big city to raise the money. Since they have been sheltered, they have no clue what to do, but luck happens to be on their side as a mysterious woman offers them the money, but they have to kill her dying husband. After being chased out of the hospital, they briefly run into Teddy. The Stooges are still broke but come up with a Salmon Farm idea, which turns into a disaster.With time running out, Larry and Curly leave Moe, hoping to raise the money on their own. Then Moe accidentally gets a role on a reality series, The Jersey Shore. While looking for Teddy, so they can ask him for money, Larry and Curly stumble onto a murder plot.I am surprised that the movie was rated PG considering that the Farrelly brothers directed it, and I am glad that did not try to raunch up the Stooges, but instead they used the old slapstick humor that the Stooges are famous for using. No one can every replace the original Stooges, but I was shocked at how well the actors stepped into the Stooges feet mimicking their voices and actions, especially Will Sasso who played Curly. The plot is simple and at times, the script feels silly, but was not that the point of the old Stooges' shorts, silliness. Even though I do prefer the originals, I did find myself laughing at the new Stooges. It is not a great film, but its fun to watch.

Roman stars Lucky McKee (who normally directs) as a shy social outcast who accidentally kills a girl (played by Kristen Bell) that he has a crush on. He keeps her body on ice in his bathtub. His depressed life changes when a strange woman becomes interested in him. This is an odd little movie. When it first starts you can easily tell that it is an low-budget film with bad camera work and lighting. I almost pushed the stop button, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad that I did. It is a strange movie, more of a thriller than a horror film. I actually felt sorry for Roman!

I was eager to buy season 4 as I absolutely loved watching it last year on HBO. It seems the writers have turned away from sex scenes that have nothing to with the plot, and concentrated more on character development. The witch Marnie steals the show!I loved the building relationship of Sookie and the cursed Eric, as it went more by the book. The added ghost story, and the Sam storyline was a nice touch, giving the season a more full, but non-bloated feeling.What I didn't care for, was the fairy storyline coming to a quick end. And what about the Hotshots? I hope season 5 will answer my questions.Overall, it was best season yet.

Trigger Man came with two other PS2 games, so I paid around $3.50 for the game as I would have never bought myself. The game has an interesting plot, but it has bad graphics, reminding the original Nintendo games. I don't recommend anybody buying it.

Since her parent's death, Heather has been living with overprotected Uncle James. She hates the man. She thinks he is only after her inherence, which she will receive when she turns eighteen. Until then she is spending her time working at a diner and dating her kind-of- boyfriend, Ben. Everything changes when she meets the tall ice-blond, Snowman.Heather instantly falls for Snowman's charms. She soon gives him money to help with his family, but she does not know he does not have a family. He does not even go to her school. Then, her uncle goes missing. Could Snowman be involved? Is Snowman a cold-blooded killer?The book cover is a little misleading. This book is not about an actually snowman, but a mysterious boy whose nickname is Snowman. There is not much of a plot to go by, but there are some twists and turns that make this book worth reading. I would like to add that this book is written for Young Adults and not for children.

Jason Statham is back as the down on his luck Luke Wright, who happens to cross paths with a young Chinese math prodigy, Mei (played by Catharine Chan). The girl knows the combination of a safe code belonging to the Chinese Organization that she has been forced to work for. The Russian Mafia wants the safe code and they will do anything to get the little girl. To make things worse, there are corrupted NYC cops that also want the code. Mei's only hope is in the hands of Luke Wright.I was in Walmart earlier today for an errand, but I glanced at the DVDS and found Safe for $14.95. I'm a Statham fan, so I bought the movie without having a clue of what it was really about. The action is top notch and Statham is at his best. The plot is interesting, but is thin and predictable. The movie feels "safe"(no pun intended) to me as if it was on cruise control. I felt that I had seen the movie before as it is similar to other Statham films. What stands out is the chemistry between Statham and Catherine Chan.Overall, Safe is an average action film at best that offers nothing new to the genre. Did I like it? Yes, but only because I'm of Statham fan.

It premiered with the re-issue of Disney's The Rescuers on December 16, 1983. Normally it was paired with other Disney shorts, Donald's Snow Fight, Pluto's Christmas, and The Art of Skiing. It aired on NBC during Christmastime in 1984-1990, on CBS in 1991-1998, on ABC for 2000 and 2003, on the Disney Channel in 1986-1999; 2002-2006, and now airs on ABC Family. Just like other animated specials, a few minutes have been edited out for commercials. I have fond memories of watching it when I was a kid and I even still enjoy watching it on DVD as an adult.

Goosebumps aired as Fox kids series in the 1990s based on the books by R.L. Stine and followed the Twilight Zone vein, but on the lighter side, besides from each twisted ending.Here we get three more episodes:The Blog that Ate Everyone has aspiring horror writer Zack Beauchamp finding an old typewriter and he types a story about a pink blob that is terrifying everyone. There is one problem with his story, the blob has come to life.My Hairiest Adventure finds Larry Boyd and his band mates trying on the Insta-Tan they found, but they don't get a tan. Instead they start to grow hair.Piano Lessons Can Be Murder tells the tale of Jerry who takes piano lessons from the strange Dr. Shreek, but then Jerry starts seeing ghosts of the teacher's former students.These three classic Goosebumps episodes are great to watch with your kids around Halloween.

I remember when Blondie and Dagwood were aired on Sunday mornings on AMC (when the channel actually aired classic movies). Sadly, this is only the release of the 28 movies. I wish there was a remastered version, but I can settle for the Volumes one and two containing a total of ten films. They really don't make family films like these anymore, even if they are a little silly at times. I still enjoying watching them.The movies are:Disc One:Blondie (1938; 70 minutes)Blondie Meets the Boss (1939; 58 minutes)Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939; 61 minutes)Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939; 67 minutes)Blondie on a Budget (1940; 72 minutes)Disc Two:Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940; 70 minutes)Blondie Plays Cupid (1940; 68 minutes)Blondie Goes Latin (1941; 69 minutes)Blondie in Society (1941; 77 minutes)Blondie Goes to College (1942; 72 minutes)

Killer Elite is based on the 1991 book The Feather Men by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, which is suppose to be based on true events that took place in the 1980s. Jason Statham plays Danny Bryce who comes out of retirement to help save his old friend Hunter (played by Robert De Niro). In order to save him, Danny must put together an elite team to help assassinate three ex-SAS agents.I'm a fan of Jason Statham movies, but his more recent outings have been on cruise control with thin plots. Killer Elite has a tight, well written script with great acting and action. I bought the movie for under five dollars at a Black Friday Sale a few weeks ago and I'm more than pleased with the movie as it has everything an action fan would want.

I was shockingly surprised at the brutal violence in the film, and this is coming for someone who is fan of Spartacus on Starz. The movie is well-acted, beautifully filmed, and the dark mystery keeps you watching till the very end.

They sneak in through a broken window.Inside, Garfield and Odie find a ten-year-old boy named Andy. He is not alone, he has brought along his wisecracking hamster, Sherman. Soon, they start to hear footsteps and strange sounds. They realize that they are not alone - there is a creature in the school!I found this book at my local thrift shop last weekend. I'm a big Garfield fan, so this was a real treat for me. A few years ago, I readGarfield and the Mysterious Mummy (Planet Reader, Chapter Book), in which I found at a thrift shop too. Garfield and the Teacher Creature is a great book for children and for Garfield fans.

Tae Bo: Strength/ Power is more of a water-downed version of the original, but I'm not saying that it is a bad workout. Here you get two workouts for a low price. The routines can be a little slow in Strength, but the pace picks up in Power. If you are already in great shape, then this DVD isn't for you. The DVD is more for beginners, or just someone who wants to throw in a new workout during the week.

Three months after the worldwide zombie outbreak that wiped 99.9% of the population, a small group of British survivors are trying to survive. They have heard that there is a ship at sea that is taking the remaining survivors to safety. The group is lead by Maddox (played by Philip Brodie) whom has just taken in a few more survivors at the beachside compound, which includes the sole survivor of the first movie's film crew, Leanne, (played by Alix Wilton Regan who is replacing Victoria Summer). Before long the zombies invade the compound causing Maddox, Leanne, Jonesy, who is constantly filming with his camera, and a few others to runaway.With no vehicles, they run on foot looking for any place for shelter. Eventually they come across some booby-traps and the remains of headless zombies in a wooded area. The carefully survey a cabin from a distance where a group of human bandits are watching another man sexually assault a female zombie. The deadly Goke (played by Russell Jones) comes out of the cabin and murders the man. That is when Leanne recognizes Goke and his henchman Manny as she had encountered them in the first movie.Instead of using their weapons, Maddox and the group battle the undead by hand-to-hand combat, so the bandits won't know their location, but it is too late as Goke learns that Leanne is alive and he has a special fate for her.I never even knew there was a movie called Zombie Diaries or that it had a sequel! I just happened to stumble across it at my local Walmart last week for only five dollars, so I thought I would give it a try as it had cool DVD cover. Well, let's just say that covers can sometimes be misleading, likeHellraiser: Revelations. Zombies Diaries 2, or also known as World of the Dead: Zombie Diaries, is a low-budget British horror film about a group of survivors trying to reach the shore to get to a ship that will rescue them. Has anybody seenResident Evil: Afterlife? It has similar plot, except for the fact that Zombie Diaries 2 doesn't use CGI special effects and it contains more graphic situations, including a rape scene, which I could have done without. Considering its budget, the movie was nicely filmed, but I got annoyed with all the shaky camera shots. It basically follows the same zombie rules set by George A. Romero in theNight of the Living Dead. Overall, Zombie Diaries 2 is better than your typical low-budget zombie flick, but it doesn't offer anything new, especially with the predictable ending.

After her husband's death, Amanda Vaughn is emotionally and financially drained because of her husband's actions, therefore she packs her bags, what the IRS didn't claim, and along with her two teenage kids, heads back home to Highland Park, Texas to live with her mother, Elizabeth "Gigi" Stopper.During high school Amanda wasn't exactly the nicest person as she made her peers' lives a living hell. Now that Amanda is back in her home town, she is looking for a new start, but four of her ex-high school (Carlene Clockburn, Sharon Peacham, and Cricket Caruth-Reilly, and Heather Cruz) peers have a grudge to settle with her as they plan on making her life miserable.I was little skeptical of GCB, but I was a fan of Kristin Chenoweth and there was nothing else to watch after Desperate Housewives. The first episode was a little rocky, but after viewing a couple more episodes, I started to enjoy the quirkiness of all the characters. I especially liked Gigi, played by Annie Potts, as she pursued Carlen's uncle, Burl, played by Bruce Boxleitner. I rolled my eyes over the backlash of the title as people were judging before they actually watched an episode. I am Christian and I never once was offended. Thanks to a lousy 9:00 PM Central timeslot, GCB didn't get a chance to expose itself to more viewers. Despite its cleverly written scripts and great acting, ABC wrongly cancelled GCB where it could have done great in the fall taking over Housewives' old timeslot.

After leaving work at Merlotte's Bar in early hours of New Year's Day, Sookie Stackhouse finds the Viking vampire, Eric Northman, walking barefoot on the highway. He has no memory of who he is, so Sookie, out of her kind heart, takes him home with her. She calls Eric's henchwoman, Pam, and informs her of the situation. It seems that a coven of witches have taken claim in the county, and they want to takeover the vampire's reign. Sookie volunteers, well she is getting paid, to take in the Eric until his memory is restored.With Sookie's ex, Bill, out of the country, she calls her brother Jason for assistance, but he shortly disappears later that night. Now, Sookie must worry about her brother, and fight off her feelings for Eric.I started reading the 4th book in the Sookie Stackhouse series last June. My plans were to read it before the third season of True Blood started, but I got sidetracked and the book eventually went back on the bookshelf. After watching the first episode of the 4th season, I decided to read Dead to the World. After a slow attempt, I managed to finish the book on July 4th. The basic `witches plot' is the main plot of the 4th season of the television series. The subplot of the missing Jason is currently being used too, but Crystal and the Hotshots were introduced during the third season. I was disappointed to learn that Bill had a very limited role in the book, but I was glad to see `Bubba' (who is absent from True Blood) had a part. I laughed out loud when Eric was watching Sookie's Buffy the Vampire Slayer VHSs while she slept. I thought Charlaine Harris has done marvelous work showing Eric's human side as he fell in love with Sookie. The only downside of the novel was the so-called `witch war' with vamps, weres, and witches, as I thought it could have been longer. Overall, I enjoyed getting back into Sookie's weird world.

I bought Tomorrow Never Dies brand new, still in the wrapping, at a thrift store last year for a dollar. I don't own a PS1, but I have played the game in my PS2. The graphics are slightly out-of-date, but the game is still fun to play.

I didn't know about this direct-to-video sequel to the Alvin & The Chipmunks 80s cartoon series until recently.While performing at the Majestic Movie Studios, Alvin, Simon and Theodore get locked inside the studios at night. At first they think it is fun, but then they discover that they are not alone. The real Dr. Frankenstein has just brought his monster "Frankie to life and he sends the monster after the chipmunks. There is a twist as Frankie has a kind heart, so Dr. Frankenstein sets his eyes on Alvin as his next experiment.The is a cute, well-written animation flick.

Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love is a single disc released around Valentine's Day in 2005. I noticed that there are a considerable number of reviews bashing the single disc releases, in which I can't understand. These sold well enough that Fox kept releasing them at the time. They were cheap enough for fans to buy or cheap enough to buy as a gift.The Episodes are from the later seasons and consist of:Natural Born KissersLarge MargeThree Gays of CondoThe Way We Weren'tThe episodes all revolve around Homer and Marge's marriage. They can be fun to watch, but they are not my favorite episodes.

Garfield's Pet Force is based on the paperback books by Garfield's creator Jim Davis and is more action-packed than the previous Garfield outings. Here we get Garfield and Friends teaming up with superheros to stop an evil baddie and her army of zombies from taking over the world.Garfield's Pet Force is a fun movie for the entire family.

Justin and Marissa are camping with their father, a famous writer, in Bravania. Their father is searching for an ancient manuscript known as The Lost Legend.The siblings are adventurous just like their father, and they go off into the forest to help find the treasure. A silver dog leads them to a female Viking, Ivanna. She tells them that they must be tested if they want to find The Lost Legend.This isn't the best Goosebumps book. It has a clever title, but everything else is just predictable, even the twist at the end. If you're a fan of the books, you'll probably still like it, but I don't recommend this to new readers.

Jaclyn and her aunt Greta just moved to a small village on the edge of the Arctic Circle from Chicago. Jaclyn is bored. There is nothing for her to do. There are no malls, movie theaters.Then she notices something odd about the town. In front of every house is a creepy snowman with a bright red scarf. The snowman has a deep scar on its face and a wicked smile.There is a rumor that two sorcerers created evil snowman years ago, and it still lives.Beware, the Snowman is the 51st book in the original Goosebumps series, and has the typical plotline - a kid arrives into a spooky new town. To me, a snowman is not very scary, and neither is this book. Overall, it still is a fun read for kids.

I've always loved the Monopoly board game and I was excited when I found this game at a local thrift store. The game is fun to play, but it is a little glitchy to play in my PS2. The game graphics are out-of-date as I have seen Monopoly PC games that look better.

Instead of ordering a third miniseries, ABC ordered V the series, which consisted of a few missing cast members, a lower budget, and a less epic feel to it. Here the Starchild is now and adult, played by Jennifer Cooke, whom the visitors are always searching for. I never felt that the visitors had a world control anymore, just a control over one city. There's more humor thrown into the episodes than in the miniseries. Just when I got interested into the show, it ends in a cliffhanger that has never resolved. The picture quality isn't the best, but I still enjoyed watching each episode.The episodes in the set are:Disc One-Side A:Liberation DayDreadnoughtBreakoutThe DeceptionDisc One-Side B:The SanctionVisitor's ChoiceThe OverlordDisc Two-Side A:The DissidentReflections in TerrorThe ConversionDisc Three-Side A:The ChampionThe WildcatsThe Littlest DragonDisc Three-Side B:War of IllusionsSecret UndergroundThe ReturnThe picture quality isn't the best!

Do you remember the Goosebumps books and TV series from the 1990s from horror mastermind R.L. Stine? Well, his new series The Haunting Hour debuted in 2010 on The Hub cable channel based upon his The Haunting Hour book, a collection of short stories.I've been a die-hard R.L. Stine fan since I was a kid, but I don't get The Hub channel, so I patiently waited for the DVDs to be released! The Haunting Hour follows the typical 22 minutes length per episode, but unlike the Goosebumps series, this series has a bigger budget and better acting. The special effects are much better this time around and the stories are much darker.In the two-part premiere Really You, Lilly (played by Bailee Madison) is a spoiled girl, always getting what she wants from her parents, especially from her dear old dad. What she wants now is the Really You life-size doll, in which her parents give in and get it for her. Strange things begin happening and Lilly suspects her doll is responsible. Her mother starts acting strange and becomes obsessed with the doll. Lilly realizes that this doll may want to actually become her.The Creature Was Stirring is set during Christmas and involves a family that is on the blink of destruction. The two older kids are greedy and are upset because they didn't get the right presents. Their parents are ready to divorce. Young Timmy sends a letter to Santa asking for help. Suddenly, a snow storm traps them inside the house and a strange gift is left for Timmy. The gift is a gremlin. The family must band together if they want to survive Christmas!Will is bulled by two teenagers in The Dead Body, which makes the episode all too real. He meets a new student named Jake, who promises to help him get back at the bullies. One of the bullies drops out school because he is too scared to return. Will finds out that Jake may have actually died in the 1950s and has come back as a ghost.After her father's recent death, Jillian's mother drags her away from her home and moves her to their new life - running an Inn. As soon as they arrive, Jillian begins having strange dreams and then the necklace that her father had gave her goes missing! The two young staffers at the Inn are acting odd and they may be creatures of the night.I flew right through these five episodes. I was surprised that the acting wasn't that bad compared to the old Goosebumps television series. The production values were impressive for a kids show. Unlike Goosebumps, the parents of the kids actually have something to do with the plots. The stories are much darker, but not too dark. The DVD, along with Volume 2, is coming out just in time for the Halloween season.

Yes, I was one of those kids that would run home everyday after school so I could watch the reruns of Saved By The Bell. One channel aired back-to-back episodes and at the same time another channel would air one episode. All my classmates watched the series and even my parents would watch on Saturday mornings.After the series had filmed its last episode in which the characters had their high school graduation, NBC ordered more episodes. Actresses Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) and Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) had already moved on to film projects are were not available to participate in new episodes. Therefore a new character was created - Tori Scott (played by Leanna Creel).Just like the two previous DVD sets, the episodes are out of order, going more by the syndication order. That's why the characters look older in one episode and a lot younger in the next. A few episodes have Jesse and Slater as a couple, but they broke up during season four!The new student Tori becomes Zack's girlfriend and befriends Screech, Slater, and Lisa, but for some reason she never meets Kelly or Jesse. As I stated above the actresses who played the parts didn't return, but there names could have been mentioned more often. Continuity errors? Or were the characters Jesse and Kelly doing something else when Tori was around? After almost twenty years it is still a mystery to me.The episodes on Season Five are:Disc 1:The FightStudent Teacher WeekScreech's Spaghetti SauceThe New GirlThe Bayside TriangleTeen LineMasquerade BallDay of DetentionDisc 2:Wrestling with the FutureDrinking and DrivingClass RingsLove MachineIsn't It RomanticThe WillThe Teacher's StrikeSlater's SisterDisc 3:The Senior PromThe Video YearbookSnow White and the Seven DorksEarthquakesThe Best Summer of My LifeSchool SongGraduationTime CapsuleThe previous sets had cheap cases with horrible menus, but for some reason Lionsgate decided to change everything for the season five set. This set has a wonderful slipcover with the episode guide written on the inner pullout case. The menu on each disc has a neat little red bell ringing when you go to each episode. This is the only season set to include an actually bonus which is a documentary about the series.I bought the DVD off of Amazon.com for fewer than eleven dollars and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. I now have seasons one through five and the two TV movies on DVD, so I can relive one of my childhood favorites anytime I want.

I saw a few reviewer ask something like, "Why would anyone buy this DVD when some of cartoons have been out on DVD before?" Well, that is easy to answer. The Spotlight Collections were a whole lot cheaper than the Golden Collection! When the Golden Collection came out they were around $60 and the Spotlights were around $10 at Walmart.The shorts in Spotlight Collection, Vol. 7 all appeared in the Golden Collections Vols. 1, 2, and 3.

A serial killer known as "The Hinsdale Slasher" has been terrorizing a small Midwestern town. Holly Brand learns that Graham is actually the killer and he has kidnapped her best-friend Zakiya. With the help of her aunt, Police Chief Debra Dorn, Holly finds out where Graham has taken Zakiya, but this killer is not what meets the eye. He is actually a werewolf!Holly becomes a hero and a media sensation after she kills "The Hinsdale Slasher", but only her aunt and best-friend know that he was in fact a werewolf. Suddenly, the ordinary teenager's, Holly, life is completely changed. All the media reporters wants her to do an exclusive interview and the poplar boys want to date her, including the star high school football player, Jeff.She gets nominated to be the Midwinter Dance Queen, which upsets a popular girl, Gina, who wants revenge!Tombstones: Dances With Werewolves was released around the time Point Horror books written for teenagers were popular. The confrontation with "The Hinsdale Slasher" occurs in the first chapter, followed by the media aftermath. It seems that the heroine, Holly, has to deal with the crazed Gina, who's having her own howling problems. The author, John Peel, does a great job of building up the suspense, making this teen horror read a page-turner. I wish Hollywood would take a look at the teen horror and thriller books from the 80s and 90s, as they are better plotted than most big-budget movies.

I bought the Flesh Eating Zombie series, which was wrapped up with Midnight Horror Collection: Killer Curses, for only five dollars at my local Walmart. I was only interested in Last of the Living Dead which is a horror comedy from New Zealand. I've seen I Am Omega before, which is a ripoff of I Am A Legend starring Will Smith. Considering I didn't pay much for the movies I'm satisfied with my purchase, but the movies are low-budget with horrible acting.Side A:Awaken the Dead (2007; 102 minutes; Not Rated)Grave Mistake (2008; 95 mintues; Not Rated)Side B:Last of the Living (2009; 87 minutes; Not Rated)I Am Omega (2007; 88 minutes; Not Rated)

Hostel Part II pickups where the first leaves off, in which you find out what happened to Paxton. Ten minutes later, the movie focuses on three female art students who happen to travel to a small Slovakian village. Their vacation comes to an end quickly as the Elite Hunting group is watching them.The first ten minutes is great continuing Paxton's story, but the movie jumps to three new characters. I was a little disappointed as I wanted to see Paxton's girlfriend, Stephanie (played by Jordan Ladd), hunt and kill the Elite Hunting group, but sadly her character is never mentioned again.The first hour is boring, but the last twenty minutes is intense. The killers get more screen time, but it adds nothing important to this sequel. Overall, I think the first movie was more watchable.

With Halloween several days away, teenager Brenda Morgan is planning a Halloween party with her friends, Traci and Dina, but they are also planning on something much deadlier - murdering Brenda's cousin, Halley! Her cousin moved in with Brenda's family because her parents are going through a nasty divorce, but she keeps interfering in Brenda's life, stealing away Brenda's boyfriend, Ted, and she keeps borrowing the car without asking first. Of course, the girls aren't really planning a murdering Halley. Their just using her name for a character in a murder mystery short story for class, at least that is what they originally planned.Strange things begin to happen to Brenda as Halloween nears, blood is smeared on her bedroom wall, a headless bird is left in a pumpkin, and chunks of rotten meat are left in her bed. Is Halley responsible for all this?Halloween Night is a sweet, quick read. The plot is well written and the bitterness Brenda has for Halley is believable, reminding me of how I felt about a few relatives at the age. There are several twist and turns throughout the book, including a stabbing at the party. It's a great read to get you into the Halloween mood.

A while back I entered into a giveaway on a blog and I won one of the prizes which was a $20 gift card from Walmart. I had completely forgotten about it until I received it several months later. I wasn't for sure what I was going to use the card for. Late one night, I surfed Walmart.com and found the sixth season of Gilmore Girls for fewer than twenty dollars. Of course I had to order it. I have been watching Gilmore Girls ever since I stumbled upon it on the late Soap.net channel earlier this year, but I watch it every weekday morning (if there isn't some kind of marathon) on ABC Family, which had just started airing the sixth season. I received the DVD set very quickly and just like season one and two (that I own on DVD); I flew right through each episode, taking in every bit of the Gilmore Wisdom.The episodes on season six are:Disc One:Episode 1: New and Improved Lorelai (9/13/05)Episode 2: Fight Face (09/20/05)Episode 3: The UnGraduate (09/27/05)Episode 4: Always a Godmother, Never a God (10/4/05)Disc Two:Episode 5: We've Got Magic to Do (10/11/05)Episode 6: Welcome to the Dollhouse (10/18/05)Episode 7: Twenty-One Is the Loneliest Number (10/25/05)Episode 8: Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out (11/8/05)Disc Three:Episode 9: The Prodigal Daughter Returns (11/15/05)Episode 10: He's Slippin' 'Em Bread ... Dig? (11/22/05)Episode 11: The Perfect Dress (1/10/06)Episode 12: Just Like Gwen and Gavin (1/17/06)Disc Four:Episode 13: Friday Night's Alright for Fighting (1/31/06)Episode 14: You've Been Gilmored (2/7/06)Episode 15: A Vineyard Valentine (2/14/06)Episode 16: Bridesmaids Revisited (2/28/06)Disc Five:Episode 17: I'm OK, You're OK (4/406)Episode 18: The Real Paul Anka (4/11/06)Episode 19: I Get A Sidekick Out of You (4/18/06)Episode 20: Super Cool Party People (4/25/06)Disc Six:Episode 21: Driving Miss Gilmore (5/2/06)Episode 22: Partings (5/9/06)There is a lot of emotional baggage that occurs through the sixth season as Lorelai and Rory spend nine episodes apart. During these episodes Lorelai gets engaged to Luke (she is the one who asked), she gets a dog named Paul Anka, and has her house remodeled. Everything changes at the end of episode nine as Rory returns home and Luke finds outs that he has a daughter named April. Unfortunately Lorelai doesn't make it down the aisle, but Rory's best friend, Lane, marries her band mate, Zach.Season six has a lot things going on in Star Hollows. I felt for Luke as he adjusted to being a father, but he had to push Lorelai away in the process. Did Lorelai overreact about all the April drama? Not really. All she wanted was to be part of April's life as she was going to be her step-mother. I didn't care for the last scene of the season with Lorelai in bed with you-know-who. Overall, I had a blast watching each coffee addicted episode.

The sequel to the hit 80s miniseries V is finally on DVD in a two discs double-sided DVDS containing all three episodes of the hit sequel. I bought the DVD when the lame remake aired on ABC a few years ago. Here we get to see the Starchild grow up and have a purpose of the future of mankind. It is a great DVD to own, but I only wish there were more extras on it.

I heard great things about From Within, therefore I finally watched it last night and I have to say that I thought the majority of the movie was clich&eacute;d and at times just plain boring. I'm getting tired of these horror religious plots that go nowhere. Sure, there is a stunning cast, who tried to the best with little they had to work with. The basic plot is that there are several suicides in a small town, in which the church members believe that a deceased devil worshipper's son is involved with the deaths. The actually truth is that the son and his brother cast a suicide spell because the churchgoers had murdered their innocent mother.There were no surprises for me as I could clearly tell who the next victim was. I have to admit that I fell asleep for twenty minutes and I don't think I missed a single thing. As for the ending, I guessed it way before it happened.Overall, From Within is an average horror film at best.

Almost as soon as they get to Alaska, something starts chasing them.Despite the title, the book is mostly set in Alaska. The title and the book cover actually giveaway the twisted ending. Overall, this is an average Goosebumps book.

Dolph Lundgren directs and plays the main character, Nikolai "Nick" Cherenko, in the 2005 action flick The Russian Specialist (aka The Mechanik). Nick left Russia and moved to America after he witnessed the brutal murder of his wife and son. He's trying to get over his loss by working as a mechanic. That is until a wealthy woman offers him $500,000 to find her daughter who has been forced into the sex trade industry in Russia. At first he rejects the job, but then he learns that the kidnapper is Sasha Popov, the man that killed his family. Nick returns to Russia and joins forces with William Burton and his band of mercenaries to take down Popov's mob.I wasn't expecting too much from a movie that I had never heard of before, but I found The Russian Specialist to be a well written and nicely directed action movie, minus the odd fade-to-black after each scene.

The Elmwood Elementary was overcrowded this year and the 3rd grade had to move into the old Blackwell mansion.The teacher, Mr. Jenkins, announced that they would be putting together a newspaper. The students would be put into groups. Norma, Adam, Chick, Debbie, Joey and Dan were picked for the psychic investigation committee.They would investigate the strange things that were happening in the school. Supplies were going missing, pencils were falling off desks, dark shadows were seen and strange noises were heard.This is one of my favorite books from my childhood. I had lost the book years ago but I found a new copy at a thrift shop recently. This is a wonderful book about friendship. If you can find a copy, buy it!
