Here Comes Everything. Not Everybody. In terms of quantum reality theory and cyborg anthropology, The Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix.While one could break the book down into a basic linear story, which weaves and meanders through the seven-stage structure, like a river, the reductionism or deconstruction approach is itself vulnerable.While there are many serious threads, FW is also a minefield of literary and linguistic-phonentic puns. I once read a review in which the writer dismissed the word "upfellbown" as one of Joyce's many nonsense words. Nope. Upfellbown is a phonetic portrayal of the German word apfelbaum, or apple tree, which Joyce had mentioned slightly earlier in the text. Where people often go off the deep end is in attributing undue significance to these individual words.If The Wake is about anything, it is about phenomenology or holism versus reductionism. The significance of the whole versus the sum of the parts. You don't understand The Wake, you experience it. On a vastly simpler level, the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys brilliantly captures the beauty of the recursive temporal symmetry that underlies Joyce's re-entrant epic.For those who have never read FW, it is basically about an Irish bricklayer called Tim Finnegan (Finnegans Wake being a traditional song, of sorts) who falls, probably drunkenly, from a ladder. The 'story' that follows is either his Death Dream or Near Death Experience, in which the entireity of Earth's history cycles through his mind. (There has even been debate about the identity of the Dreamer.) Symbolically, Finnegan's fall from the ladder could be representative of the Fall of Lucifer or the Fall of man.The Wake means whatever it means to the individual reader at that point in his or her lifetime. For me, the many references to the Triple Goddess and Masonic ritual leaped out of the text. Yet had I not read so much about these things, the references would mean nothing. Yet, I have probably missed thousands of things that others will see.Quick example... The three main female characters, Kate, Issy (Isis) and ALP form the principle references to the presence of the Great Mother/The Triple Goddess. Both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are about return. The return to the cosmic womb of the Great Mother. The beginning and the end of Time.Issy is Isis, who is in herself the Mother Goddess. Issy's room is blue with a ceiling of stars - "the twinkly way". A classic feature of the ceilings of Masonic lodges. Sirius, the Star of Isis is the Blazing Star of freemasonry, whose square and compass logo can be extended out to form a pentagram, depicting the four elements, plus the fifth element - the Creatrix. The third degree ceremony of freemasonry is a symbolic death and rebirth, symbolized by the skull and crossbones - the sign of Osiris risen. The Wake, which itself is about rebirth and resurrection - Finnegan = Finn Again, has many esoteric references, and even obvious ones, such as PHOENIX Park, and the fact that the book is set on March 21st, the Spring or Vernal Equinox - the beginning of the pagan New Year.Aw hell, I'm rambling. That's the trouble with The Wake. It sucks you in. Give it a shot, but don't try to understand it from the outset. Try to just read it all the way through first and then maybe do some dissection. Whereas Ulysses is 24 hours out of Bloom's life, allegorically interwoven with the Ulysses myth (instead of returning to Ithaca, he returns to Number Seven Eccles Street), FW is just too massive to see a linear series of exact correspondences. There's also a great deal of literary chaff. The man had a sense of humour, after all.The bottom line for me, is that The Wake is about the transforming power of the Feminine - like Mary Poppins, like Chocolat, like A Midsummer Night's Dream, like Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass, like Cities Of The Red Night...Here Comes Everything...

A gorgeous novel. Mary is a superb writer, and I love the subtle way she has extended the Peter Pan story in this absolute gem.While the original Peter Pan story revolved around Peter's attempt to delay Wendy's transition to womanhood (he took the children on her last night in the nursery), in Second Star we find Peter Pan (the Guardian of the Dead and the Lost Souls) is pivotal to the now aging Wendy's transition to the next life - which as the book suggests, may also be in the Never Land.Mythology and quantum reality theory aside, this is also a beautiful love story, and the way in which Faye's relationship unfolds is just challenging enough to keep you guessing.First class piece of writing. I'd love to see a sequel in which the ghost of Pan walks again.

Yeah... Murderously funny movie. So many very strong characters that it just couldn't fail. No surprise, with Mike (Beavis and Butthead) Judge at the helm.Office Space brilliantly captures the mind-numbing tedium of repetitive code debugging projects in the run up to the December 31st, 1999 deadline. (The M Bug was a genuine problem, in that ANY computer code based on the concept that tomorrow's date must be numerically larger than any previous date WOULD fall over.)While the superb Gary Cole steals the show as the intensely irritating boss Bill Lumburgh, whose coffee mug never leaves his hand (even when he is making love to Jennifer Aniston in a fantasy sequence), every member of the cast gives 1000%.Rather than give away any specific details of the plot, I will just add that OS contains many sharp and witty insights into the ritual dance of modern office life, played out by the craziest collection of characters ever assembled in one movie. For that reason, it is scarily close to reality.Great... Yeah...

As with her performance in Tim Burton's 'Alice', Anne Hathaway brings her otherworldly magic to this adaptation of the life of Jane Austen.Yes, it bends the events and time periods, but it remains a delightful film that gives the viewer some insights into the life and times of a classic female writer.No, Austen did not have the modern Gothic boldness of the Bronte sisters who followed her - Austen's most Gothic novel was a satirical pastiche - Northanger Abbey - and her tendency to include weddings and happy ever after scenarios has been a source of criticism for eons. However, the film captures the reality of a woman struggling for recognition in the dark ages of patriarchal domination, and the irony whereby Austen never allowed herself the ultimate happy ending. No Mr.Darcy coming across the fields, no Colonel Brandon riding to the rescue...Ending as it does, the film does not really capture the final phase of Austen's life and her development as a person and as a writer - the significance of Persuasion, her elegiac final novel, and her the 'life imitating art' final passing, with her head in her sister Cassandra's lap - a death worthy of the Brontes themselves...Definitely worth a viewing.

Having first seen Milla as the stoner chick in Dazed and Confused, I was mightily impressed with her powerful performance in this beautifully made Art Movie - and that's what it is.I totally accept the many valid points about the sketchy casting of certain figures and groups, and even some bending of history, but the movie just has a power of its own, and despite certain shortcomings, I would highly recommend it.The graphic approach to the violence of hand-to-hand combat reminded me of Kenneth Brannagh's stunning interpretation of Shakespeare's Henry V, and Besson's Joan definitely has the same Classic feel to it.Being a top model, I suspect that Milla Jovovich has experienced the same kind of jealousy-based animosity towards her multi-faceted talent (she was also stunning in the Bruce Willis classic The Fifth Element) as David Bowie has. Despite many excellent film performances, especially his superb role in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, David has also drawn fire from people who seem unwilling to acknowledge that he is also a fine actor as well as a brilliant singer-songwriter.Milla Jovovich portrays a reluctant Warrior Woman who clearly had some kind of ongoing psychic experiences, and who was traumatized by male brutality at an early age. Whether she had a sister or not, she saw other females being raped and killed, as did Queen Boadicea, who was herself raped, along with her daughters.Boadicea made the Romans pay for their brutality, just as Joan of Arc made the English pay for theirs. Neither woman would have been like the simpering milk-toast versions of Joan that we have seen elsewhere. They would have been almost psychotic and able to rouse thousands of male warriors with their fire alone.To me, Milla Jovovich played the part flawlessly.

A breathtakingly beautiful film. The Fisher King is one of the most perfectly executed movies of all time, from the stunning and highly imaginative screenplay to the haunting quality of the direction and the sheer genius of Williams and Bridges, who both turned in the performance of a lifetime. Add to that a supporting cast made in heaven and you basically can't go wrong.While the film succeeds brilliantly even as a basic story of star-crossed individuals working out their joint karma, it is the concept of the soul's journey homeward that drives the deeper levels of The Fisher King.As Barbara G. Walker and others have pointed out, the Grail is actually a representation of the Womb of the Great Mother, from which we all came, and to which we shall all return. Like Finnegan and Bloom/Ulysses, The Fisher King's two heroes find salvation in the simplicity of surrender and in the almost Faustian embracing of the Sacred Feminine, as embodied by the two female leads. Carrie Moss's Trinity (The Triple Goddess) also provides this transcendent nurturing to Keanu Reeves's character in The Matrix.If you were to buy The Fisher King, The Matrix, Groundhog Day and Jacob's Ladder, you would have in your possession some of the most profound philosophical insights in the history of the human race.A true masterpiece. Dang, it even features a cameo by Tom Waits.

Roxanne... Great movie, although I was disappointed that there are no interviews or a Making Of feature. After the fantastic extras on the When Harry Met Sally DVD, I was hoping somebody would get Steve and Co. together and create a behind the scenes documentary for Roxanne. Maybe one day. It deserves it.This classic was filmed almost entirely in Nelson, BC, and was supposed to be Nelson, WA, an hour or so south of its Canadian equivalent. It's hard to pick out some of the locations as the camera angles virtually all compensate for the fact that Nelson (an Aspen-like town in the BC interior) is very hilly. Where the mighty John Kapelos (Chuck) tries his Playmate of the Month routine on the foxy Caroline Barclay, it looks like a level street, but Ward St. is actually on a hill, like most of Nelson.I actually agree with some other reviewers that it's hard to believe that an intelligent and sensitive man like C. D. would fall for a shallow, sarcastic smarty pants like Darryl Hannah's Roxanne, when he obviously had major chemistry with the beautiful, sexy, funny, highly intelligent Dixie, played by the divine Shelley Duvall. Maybe Shelly was just too hot for character.Still, Life doesn't always make sense.This is a truly hilarious movie and Rick (Top Gun) Rossovich excels as Chris, the hunky Pro firefighter. This guy is a very underrated actor, believe me.Fantastic cast, fantastic movie.

This movie is like a breath of fresh air.A great cast, a fluid and entertaining script, and solid production and direction, all combine to produce a classic romantic comedy, with a difference.Yet behind the hilarious situations and the enchanting spontaneous psychic revelations, The Butcher's Wife is a story of the transforming power of the Feminine - like Mary Poppins, Chocolat and a number of other classic movies.While her Carolina accent is a little shaky at times, Demi is just superb, as are Jeff, Frances, Margaret, Mary and George, above all.It certainly is a Feel Good movie, and a highly original one at that. Go for it.

This is an inspired compilation, which includes virtually every major BBD classic. As someone else pointed out, Futurama and Sunburst Finish are the best Be Bop albums, but as Futurama is presently unavailable (I managed to pick up a used CD, with the extra tracks) this superb double CD set includes all but three of the Futurama tracks anyway - Stage Whispers, Sound Track and Swan Song.While this set is filled with excellent songs, including relative rarities such as Speed Of The Wind, it was always Nelson's killer guitar solos that turned people into die hard fans. The inclusion of so many Guitar Overkill numbers from Sunburst and Futurama, as well as the classics Axe Victim and Yorkshire Landscape, ensure total satisfaction. Very useful little booklet, too.Absolutely essential purchase for any serious Bill Nelson addict. I'm not one myself, of course... I could stop playing it any time I want... I just... don't want to.. yet...

A truly outstanding film by any standards, and in the wake of so many articulate reviews it's hard to add much, beyond giving it further well-deserved praise.I have always considered AN to be a true Art Movie in the classical sense, and the combination of inspired direction, production, casting, cinematography, screenplay, you name it, almost puts this movie out on its own.Yet there were a few questionables even in this work of genius. For one thing, it is unlikely that an unsupported Game Warden PBR crew would be interdicting suspect sampans with an important G2 (Army Intelligence) cargo such as Willard on board. It is also unlikely that he would have been entrusted to a crew that was so openly cracked. Still, it makes for a good movie.If they had to deliver an operative of Sheen's obvious caliber way up river, they would do everything to minimize the risks, not be pulling over junks that could be full of VC, who could lob a satchel charge on board, trigger a Soviet-model Claymore (directionalized fragmentation mine, with a wide kill vector) as the vessels closed in, or just simply pull out AK-47's and RPG's and try to shoot it out, once the weapon arcs of the fifties had been degraded by proximity. i.e. if you're too close, you can't maximize your superior firepower. (Plus, cornered VC would have nothing to lose by firing RPG's point blank.)Equally, when Kurtz talks about the 'strength' it took for the VC to cut the innoculated arms of the children in the village he had passed through, this is a very misguided belief. If a group of women, with children of their own could do it, it might have been strength. What he saw was the result of cold, masculine detachment. Callousness is not strength.While it's possible to go beyond this and list various technical flaws, it would be mere nit picking, and the movie deserves better than that. Overall, it succeeds mightily, and remains one of the best Vietnam movies yet made, and one full of memorable characters.Anybody who thinks that Robert Duvall's Kilgore character is an exaggeration, doesn't know the Air Cav. You had to be crazy, wonderfully crazy, to do what they did, day after day, from the Slick (Huey) pilots to the Snake Drivers (Huey Cobra). The superb Duvall played the role of a lifetime as Kilgore, and he was just about dead on - most of the guys still wear their Stetsons to this day.If you have never seen this movie, you are in for an incredible experience. I still keep going back to it every few months and amazingly, it never dates or loses its impact.Look out for Harrison Ford as Colonel Lucas, the Intelligence Officer near the beginning. What a cast.

Well, I'm exaggerating, but Michael Hogan's eastern Canada accent seeps through quite a lot for a supposed American living in western Canada. Likewise, both Matt and Michael are a few years too young to be playing draft dodgers, but all in all, they did a great job.This is a sweet, sweet little movie, and I have lived among similar folk in this very Kootenay setting long enough to see real people in place of many of these charming characterizations. And yes, this place really is as beautiful as it looks in the movie.Michael's character of Jim is suitably stubborn, blinkered and irritating, but despite him being an artisan, he seems like too much of a yokel for many of the draft dodgers I have known over the years. Most of them are more academically inclined, having less of the Hick Factor.The movie deals with all kinds of coming of age and cross-cultural/cross-generational issues and is heavily laced with love/sex interests and humor - I loved the carob/halva scene above all. I'm sure many Kootenay kids feel his pain.Hippy parents... whaddaya gonna do?Definitely worth a viewing, y'all.

It would be real cozy if Oswald had just been a disturbed individual who didn't get enough love and attention as a child, as in the Peter Gabriel song Family Snapshot, but alas, that might be an over-simplification.Whatever you think about the Conspiracy/No Conspiracy battle, anybody should be able to appreciate this stunning movie, as a movie, which features a performance by Kevin Costner that is basically as good as it gets.I won't repeat the rightful praise heaped on the movie by other reviewers, except to say that every good thing you have heard about this masterpiece is true.As for the Conspiracy itself, the movie contains a few elements that may have arguably been discredited but on the whole, it asks a lot of questions that have never been satisfactorily answered. After the shameful whitewash attempt by author Gerald Posner, 'Case Closed' (gotta love his arrogance) JFK is like a breath of fresh air.Personally, I didn't like or trust Kennedy, so I don't have a political axe to grind by aligning myself with the Pro-Conspiracy side. It's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations.Gerald Posner's utterly laughable 'explanation' of the second shot as being a reflex action, in which JFK's head suddenly jerked backwards, is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex.Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant. He has gone a long way towards proving that a complex Conspiracy did in fact exist, and that's without including some of the most extreme (though not ridiculous) theories.Just enjoy JFK as a piece of Art, because thanks to Stone, Costner and a stunning cast, that is what it is.

... that if you took a hundred self-proclaimed Barry Manilow haters and hooked them up to a PolyGraph machine, 99 of them would turn out to be liars. The 100th would be found to have no musical taste whatsoever.A great song is a great song, whether it's Stairway To Heaven, Like A Hurricane or Could It Be Magic and Weekend In New England. While it has been hip to like Led Zeppelin and Neil Young, it hasn't always been hip to like Barry Manilow or the Carpenters. Yet both Barry and the Carpenters have unquestionably recorded some of the most beautiful and well-constructed songs in the history of the music business.This is a great album, but I too would question the title word "Ultimate". I am very happy with every song on the album, but I would like to have seen a few more classics included, such as New York City Rhythm. Still, it's well worth having, and great value at the price that www.Amazon.com are offering.

This is a rare coming together of the perfect cast (including Carrie and Bruno) and a perfect screenplay, all pulled together by excellent production and direction.To me, this cleverly scripted classic movie set the standard for Romantic Comedy as a genre. There are so many brilliant pieces of dialogue, flawlessly delivered by an impeccable Bily Crystal and Meg Ryan that it makes your head spin. Nora Ephron excelled herself in putting this masterpiece together, and if this is a Chik Flik, then I'd like to see a whole lot more.This is a movie for women and men who love to watch a well-crafted story, full of wit, love, compassion and all manner of brilliantly observed human social quirks.It really is as good as you have heard.Hey, how about that fake orgasm?

There's a line from American Pie in which one of the young guys declares, &quot;Women are like fine wine. They just get better with age.&quot; So true. All of the women in this movie are living proof of that, especially Annabeth Gish, who went from being merely girl-next-door pretty in Mystic Pizza, to the mature goddess we have seen on the X-Files.Mystic Pizza is very much an ensemble movie, with no one person standing out above the rest. A very strong female cast is counterpointed by some solid male performances, such as that of the always superb Vince D'Onofrio - also check out The Cell, with Jennifer Lopez.Beautifully filmed in Conn. New England, the movie is also a visual delight, and captures the reassuring simplicity of life in an Atlantic fishing community. I love Nova Scotia and Maine for the same reason. The original Mystic Pizza restaurant is still going strong and their website is well worth a visit.All in all, a very sweet movie about real people and real family situations, and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I literally never tire of this modern classic. My only quibble is that the last spoken line is disturbingly unimaginative and anti-climactic. After crafting such a superb screenplay, the writers just seemed to run out of inspiration at the last hurdle. As Mr. Spock would say, &quot;Fascinating.&quot;

As I originally come from the same part of England this movie was filmed in, I found this doubly enjoyable, although my buddies in Alabama might need a version with subtitles...This is one of those rare movies that is as good as you have heard, and it is one of the best human interest stories I have seen in a long time. A real film about real characters, who many people will be able to identify with, or recognize in their friends, family and neighbors.While the laughs are there in bucketfulls, the movie also sensitively deals with issues such as divorce, co-parenting, unemployment and psychological impotence, in additon to the obvious theme of male bonding in the face of social and financial stresses.One of the few flaws in the plot is the way Dave's wife seemed to be the only woman in the whole city who hadn't heard about the boys practising for the strip show.Good, solid entertainment.

So said the late and great Ronnie Van Zant in the intro to Sweet Home Alabama, and he was right.It is obscene and a total distortion of reality to describe the Confederate Flag as a "racist symbol". Don Hinkle has certainly done us proud with this much-needed boost for the good people of The South.The supreme irony is that by attempting to ban the Confederate Flag (anti-Flag pedants please note, my capitalization is deliberate) they will turn it into a rallying symbol for every WASP who has had enough of being blamed for all of the evils of the world.Proportionally speaking, very few whites have openly supported the KKK and other Right Wing groups. Yet with a Communist-inspired "Liberal" onslaught on the Confederate Flag, lines are bound to become blurry.Yes, slavery was wrong, we've all figured that out, and if we hadn't been deliberately undermined by reckless and subversive immigration policies, black and white integration would have taken place much more rapidly.The number of lies about The Racist South are equalled only by the pitiful attempts to deify thugs such as Lincoln, whose War Of Northern Aggression only belatedly and incidentally embraced the slavery issue. As another reviewer correctly observed, it was about taxation and the suppression of The South.Good job, Don. It ain't Tolstoy, but it's written from the heart, and The Truth will always get through. Time to give up the Confederate Flag? No, it's time to draw a line in the sand.

Hack's classic has been on the way back for some time now, and it's an essential purchase now that it's here.Like WW II Special Forces commanders Chapman and Wingate before him, Hack realized that The Jungle Is Neutral i.e. it did not favor the Enemy. He set out to understand the Enemy and the realities of asymmetrical jungle warfare, with a view to being able to Out Guerrilla the Guerrilla. He succeeded.I shall be buying a few copies for some of my Vietnam Vet friends, as a reminder of how good the US troops could be with the right leadership and tactics. With a man like Hack out front.I agree with another reviewer that this would benefit any combat troops, whatever the situation they are being deployed to.Perhaps the saddest thing to reflect on, is that even after Hack turned the hopeless into hardcore with his proven tactical innovations, raw troops were still arriving in Nam having been trained for a conventional war.Outstanding.

The Bowie detractors will be having a bad year. From the opening number New Killer Star to the haunting, timeless, Jazz Club in the Pressure Dome feel of Bring Me The Disco King, David once again stamps his authority on the floundering music industry.While ever the Duke can still produce stunning albums like Reality and Heathen, the Bowie bashers will continue to look like the losers that they are.This is a remarkable album and yet more evidence of the Man's inventive and unique songwriting skills. Years ago, during the Punk/New Wave era, the British Music press carried a David Bowie ad for albums like Low and Heroes, entitled 'There's New Wave, there's Old Wave, and there's Bowie'. Hype? I don't think so. He really is that good. A truly unique talent, who follows nobody.David's seemingly endless ability to re-invent himself, whether it be in an Industrial, Retro or Dance context, is the key to his success. Just when you think you've figured out his next move, he throws in a creative curve ball.An outstanding album and one that I have yet to stop playing. For my money, Reality and Heathen are two of the best albums since the many classics of his earlier years, up to the superb Let's Dance.It just doesn't get any better.

So sayeth The White Queen, who was experiencing time backwards, but what 'happens' in this movie is a little hit and miss.When it works, it works well, and some of the casting, especially of Depp and Hathaway, was inspired.The story is, as usual, a blend of the two books, with the added re-entrant twist that an adult Alice is returning to Wonderland/Underland. The special effects are well done, although I hated the enlarged head that Burton gave to Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. She is a beautiful, classically-trained actress and the absurd distortion serves only to irritate and distract.The final Joan of Arc-style battle against the Jabberwock at least lifts the movie towards the end, before shambling back into the sterile, over-stereotyped garden party.For me, it fell well short of what it should have been, despite some solid performances. If you are going to effectively rewrite/extend the Alice saga, what is the point in stopping short of REALLY rebuilding the story arc, and taking it onto another level?The four stars are for Bonham Carter, Depp and Hathaway, who all injected their otherworldly magic into a movie that was barely worthy of their talent.

Brilliant. This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and the teaming up of Jeff Bridges and John Goodman was a stroke of genius.In TBL, you can see echoes of Jeff's Jack Lucas character from the Bridges/Williams classic The Fisher King, but here, Jeff is playing it strictly for laughs.No shortage of the eff word in here folks, so unless your granny is a tattooed biker chick, I'd suggest it ain't a good, solid movie for all the family. Good solid entertainment in every other way, though.One of the best Jeff Bridges movies out there.

I will not attempt to describe the plot as this has already been done rather well by a number of people. I will just rave... 12 Monkeys is the most breathtaking piece of recursive temporal symmetry since Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. Perhaps one of the most perfectly conceived and executed movies of all time - up there with Blade Runner and Jacob's Ladder.While the Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix, 12 Monkeys is necessarily simpler, because of its movie format. Yet the movie generates the same transcendent majesty as the concluding temporal convergence reveals to the viewer that this has been as much a spiritual odyssey as a brilliantly constructed Science Fiction story.Without giving anything away, the bitter-sweet climax is one of the most stunning and uplifting scenes in the history of the film industry. This total classic and its cast and crew should have won everything in sight. It's way over Joe Wife Beater's head, but any true Sci Fi fan will love it.

Every so often a movie comes along that simply shines, and stands head and shoulders above the competition. When Harry Met Sally was one, and Notting Hill is another.The screenplay is exceptionally well written and the casting just flawless. This is more like a case of having a dozen co-stars rather than a 'supporting cast'.The DVD extras are excellent, especially Hugh's 'movie tips', and the Commentary, which was incredibly informative. The only complaint I have is that the commentators talked over Julia's stunning "Just a girl" dialog, and even over the later scene in which Hugh reiterated her words.That scene is one of the finest performances of Julia's career, and to have the guys talking over it is simply bewildering, so please prepare yourselves for the segment, if you are listening to the Commentary.A must-have DVD.

I respectfully suggest that anyone who loves this classic film might find the following book invaluable - The Real Tadzio: Thomas Mann's Death In Venice And The Boy Who Inspired It, by Gilbert Adair - available on Amazon.com.I start out by making this suggestion as the book review by top 20 Amazon Reviewer Grady Harp is very insightful in identifying the thematic clash of Apollonian and Dionysian energies as embodied by Aschenbach and Tadzio, respectively.Visconti's Death In Venice, which was followed 2 years later by Britten's opera of the same name (which I am about to acquire through Amazon.com), contains one of Bogarde's finest nuanced performances, and with an inspired soundtrack that is heavy on the Mahler (the lush strings of the Adagietto from the 5th Symphony are to die for... in a manner of speaking) this film is a work of art by any definition.The events in the film broadly back reference a trip to Venice that writer Thomas Mann took with his family, in which he met a young Polish boy, whose beauty inspired the novella and the character of Tadzio.The symbolic undercurrents ultimately flow into a tragically logical conclusion as the dying Aschenbach watches Tadzio walk off into the sea, a metaphor for Consciousness and the return to the Womb of the Great Mother.

Bob Dylan once said, &quot;Don't criticize what you can't understand&quot;, yet a number of people who are clearly clueless about Jacob's Ladder have done just that.Jacob Singer's Book of the Dead journey of the soul is the thread that holds this dark, surrealistic quagmire together. I believe the biblical Jacob's Ladder was a ladder connecting Earth and Heaven, like the Earth-Sky conduits evident in so many Emily Carr paintings, hence the title choice by Bruce Joel Rubin.The more Jacob rages to hold onto life and to make sense of the kaleidoscope of horror that keeps exploding upon his consciousness, the harder his personal demons bite back. Only at the moment of final surrender can he see that the Enemy is himself, and he is able to release his previously earthbound soul from its prison of fear.As one astute reviewer put it, the ending is the point of the film.

Okay, five stars may seem generous, as the movie doesn't really get off the ground in terms of emotional involvement, but it's still a sweet, sweet tale with an exceptional cast.The beautiful New England oceanfront/harborfront locations (mainly filmed in Gloucester and Rockport) make for an exquisite setting for a pleasent romp that is filled with low-key fun situations and snappy dialog. Tom Selleck delivers a particularly well-rounded performance, and Ellen just about steals the show when it comes to humor and sheer sparkle.There are actually two love letters in the story; the one that causes all the confusion and the one that lay unread for years, that Kate Capshaw's character only finds towards the end of the movie.Not really a thigh slapper, nor is it The English Patient, but a delightful way to spend an hour and a half.Technically, the movie probably bombed, with a budget of 15 million and only raking in about 9 million all told (as far as I can tell), but don't let that put you off

A wonderful book.We tend to associate PTSD with Vietnam Vets, and the term was first coined during the seventies, after the War, but PTSD refers to trauma of whatever kind, from whatever source.There are some wonderful reviews from people who have found the book to be helpful in their own recovery, and that was one of the things that made me buy it. I was not disappointed.Even among my Vietnam Vet friends, who range from Marines and combat medics to Army Nurses and Red Cross Donut Dollies, there is a great deal of variation in how they experience PTSD.As many of the non-Vet readers will know, trauma is trauma, whether it is combat-related or not, and this book approaches it in that way.One Vietnam Vet friend who worked on the IWCS system in Thailand (troposcatter long haul communications) suffers from PTSD, even though his support role to the Vietnam-based forces technically kept him out of harm's way.Whether you are interested in self-healing or in understanding the pain of others close to you, this book is a wonderful place to start.

While the anti-war, anti-violence message is always a worthy one, I was disappointed with the sloppy and clumsy execution in this movie.While the movie is visually captivating, there are times when the script becomes infantile - almost as though Levinson and Williams were so busy slapping each other on the back during the shoot that nobody bothered to monitor the quality of the dialogue.Surely they could have been imaginative enough to suggest the phallic nature of weaponry without having at least two actual references to the size of the male organ. It is that very childishness and lack of vision that stops me giving this movie five stars.Yes, Joan Cusack was absolutely superb, as she aways is.Ironic that an anti-war film maker should end up making a box office 'bomb'.

The doctor's four, the lawyer's seven.That joke, cracked by a Jewish buddy, goes some way towards explaining the 'traditional' dislike of Jews in general, which has sometimes tragically spilled over into outright persecution and genocide.One of the reasons I have always clicked with Jewish contacts, who later became friends, is that they are highly intelligent and goal driven.Yet this desire to be the best they can be, in business, in education, has often triggered jealousies in others, who resent the successes of the Jews, even though they have been honestly earned.I agree with Lucien, that the idea that Jew haters have somehow been driven by some theological wranglings regarding the nature of 'the Jews' God' and the requirements of worship, never enters the head of most knee-jerk Jew bashers.While some of Prager's ideas regarding the early development of anti-Semitism are worthy of attention, I think he perhaps underestimates how much of it has now and for centuries been literally the result of habit and 'passed down' hate mongering.Everybody knows everybody hates the Jews, so they still do.Also, the suggestion, however worded, that only anti-Semites see America as being Israel's big brother and protector, is very shaky, as historically alone, the US has always clearly and unequivocally supported Israel, the landmark act being the unprecedented airlift of weapons to bolster a flagging Israel, during the Yom Kippur War (Operation Nickel Grass).It's a good book, and Prager is a fine writer who does his homework; I'm just not sure that all of his conclusions are bang on.Shalom.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Season 3 was at least as strong as Season 2, if not stronger, which is quite a feat of writing.Duchovny is masterful throughout, and his stunning chemistry with his screen muse Karen, is the cornerstone of what has been an unparalleled series.Yep, it's strictly adult entertainment, and it needs to be seen as, to paraphrase the beautiful Embeth Davidtz, a mockumetary of the crazy, no-consequence LA life that it is portraying. The show, from the beginning, has been a parody of itself, but it works.As we go into Season 4, Hank will be facing some major challenges, partly due to his poor, reactive handling of the Mia situation in the Season 3 finale.Interesting times ahead.

Excellent. I read the lesser, although well-intentioned book by Stanley Weintraub, but this is clearly the best book on the subject of the tragically short Christmas Truce, 1914.The very fact that the truce even arose, suggests the idea that even World War One was a war orchestrated by the World Banking System. There was no logical reason for the Brits and the Germans, who had fought together (as the Prussians) to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo, to go to war with each other.The more you read about how much the troops had in common, and how much they resisted resuming combat, the more angry you become at the sheer fraud underlying modern conflict. I seriously question whether there are any 'honest wars', and I am no pacifist. I just hate to think of people's sons and daughters dying so that rich people get get even richer.

This really is a masterpiece from one of the most talented musicians ever to walk the Earth. Sadly, Dick passed away at the end of last year, but he left us with so many beautiful moments to savor, many of them captured on this stunning album.While I was aware of him from his work with John Mayall, it was his exquisite sax work with John Hiseman's Colosseum that really got me on board as a lifelong DHS fan. The ghost of Colosseum permeates this solo album in a very positive way, partly due to the evocative soloing by Dick, which often harkens back to his many classic Colosseum solos (Valentyne Suite being a breathtaking showcase for his and John's genius).John Hiseman did an excellent job in the Producer's chair, vacating it to play on the album's mind-blowing epic The Pirate's Dream, originally a DHS/Dave Clempson song from Colosseum days, which John helped the boys develop into the work of genius it became, as you will see here. One of the many wonderful things about this album is the inclusion of a devastating 'live' version of Pirate's Dream as one of three Bonus Tracks and two previously unreleased Manchild recordings.If you are a Colosseum fan, this is an essential purchase, or if you just love good music, likewise.Did I mention that it was absolutely stunning?

Joan (Love and Affection) Armatrading's stunning theme song was the perfect way to end a near-perfect movie. The divine songstress from St. Kitts was the perfect choice to deliver an emotive performance of a song that fully captures the heart of the movie.The stellar cast could not be better, right down to every level of the superb supporting cast, and the entire story is chillingly believable.I felt that the camp combat medic was a tip of the hat to the many courageous gay and lesbian service members who have served in silence in every war there has ever been. In 2000, the UK joined Australia and about 22 other countries in allowing openly gay and lesbian service members. Sadly, the US still only has the 'Don't ask don't tell' policy.Great action sequences, sets and equipment, and any movie that has Richard Burton, Roger Moore and Richard Harris up front simply has to be worth watching, and The Wild Geese genuinely delivers on the promise presented by such a strong piece of casting.The production and direction were also top notch, and the movie certainly holds your attention all the way through.Faults? Only one I can think of... How did those 'Yahoos' make the final cut?

I must say, I agree with David Ludd, that the editorial review does not do this classic album justice, and Neil's phrase about 'mother nature on the run' is so obviously an ecology statement that it is bewildering how anyone claiming to be a reviewer could see it as a 'riddle'.Neil's versatility is legendary, and the man who gave us one of the most beautiful love songs ever written, Harvest Moon, and the rock anthem Like A Hurricane, built an incredibily solid foundation with this timeless album.While we all have our favorites, this is one of those rare albums where you could almost pick a track at random and it would be a classic.To me, the man has never put out a bad album, but this is one that will ensure his musical immortality.

A classy movie, with a very talented cast, headed by the always-superb Depp. So why only four stars? Well, like some other viewers, I felt that it lacked that final something to make it an irresistible movie.Perhaps the one thing that made me skeptical from early on is the way the film followed the Masonic Conspiracy Theory set out by Stephen Knight in Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution. Without giving anything away, the Ripper that Depp uncovers - a real-life person of the time - was believed to have been geographically excluded from the possible suspect list, in that for one or more of the murders, he was nowhere near London, let alone Whitechapel.Curiously, the movie doesn't make much of the 'From Hell' letter that gave the film its name. This letter, written in blood-like red ink, was believed to have been one of only two letters that may have been sent by the Ripper - all the rest being hoaxes.The actresses who played the prostitutes were simply magnificent, which created a human aspect to the drama that was essential to involving the viewer. What happened to those women was unforgivable and the movie succeeds in making the point that they were innocent victims of circumstance, who only followed their 'profession' out of poverty and desperation.The psychic element whereby Depp's Abberline can 'see' some of the murder details is a very interesting feature and lifts From Hell onto another level.As far as the Catholic prostitute carrying a Royal baby theory goes, there have been so many illegitimate children to royalty over the centuries that such an event need not have been enough to trigger such a systematic campaign of brutality. Even given that the Prince allegedly 'married' the Catholic prostitute in an apparently legal ceremony with 5 ... witnesses, needn't have been much of a cause for concern.Remember, in those days, the Government was all-powerful and any official denial backed by the mere threat of extermination would have been enough to take care of any attempt to exploit the situation via the Press.Who was the Ripper? Either a totally unknown local man, who had worked as a porter in the morgue of a teaching hospital, or somebody acting as part of a Conspiracy group. But not driven by something so mundane as a royal baby. Yet perhaps involving a bloodline infinitely more precious and therefore dangerous. A sacred bloodline, a holy bloodline. And MARY Kelly did get away. Now that would make a more original plot twist.A trifle unimaginative, but this is still a great movie and well worth the typically excellent Amazon.com price.

"Case Closed". Really, you just can't throw phrases like that out there and expect to be taken seriously. Similarly, Gerald Posner claimed to have closed the JFK case, by "proving" that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Nonsense.With the Ripper case, the sheer age of the case and the questionable quality of the evidence, such as it is, makes it totally impossible to do more than make a series of educated guesses.Pat Cornwell has put forward some interesting ideas, although her non-definitive DNA "evidence" is somewhat misleading and as for handwriting "experts"... well, yeah.The most fascinating thing about the Jack The Ripper case is why it has been so compelling for so many people. If the case really did only consist of five murders, in a city in which all human life was cheap, especially among the poor, why should it have taken on such an enduring mystique?Apart from the favoured-by-some Royal Conspiracy theories, one of the most unique elements in the JTR murders was the incremental level of violence that the killer used. By the final murder, in which the greatest level of mutilation was employed, Jack had played himself out in terms of his ability to layer more horror on the police and townsfolk of Whitechapel.Sickert could have easily been the Ripper. Yet, any one of a dozen suspects could have done it, either singly or with an accomplice. While reading Cornwell's book, the most chilling thought that occured to me was that virtually ANYBODY could have been the killer.We will never know why the Ripper killed those apparently innocent women, or why he used a mind-boggling level of mutilation on the fifth victim. What we can be sure of is that given sufficient cause, most people could unleash similar violence on a "deserving" party. I have only experienced this unparalleled hatred for an enemy once in my life, when I was being hounded by a sadistic Collection Agency (they are ALL sadistic). At the peak of the harassment, I know completely that I would definitely have used a Ripper-level of violence and brutality against certain individuals, had they appeared in front of me, instead of hiding behind a false Desk Name, at the other end of a telephone. In dehumanizing me, they dehumanized themselves. This then, is perhaps the key to understanding our fascination with this unfettered use of violence.Whether the Ripper was a misogynist, a contract killer employed by the Royals, a deranged psychopath or whatever, he carried out a short series of violent acts that seemed to wound the fabric of Time itself. More than anything, he showed us the Dark Side that lurks in too many people. Perhaps all people. Just waiting to be triggered. Just waiting to bring Him back, from Hell.No, the case is not closed, and it never will be.

Three stars for the illustrations, but zero for the text. Frankly, the text flow makes no dang sense whatsoever. While I accept that there could be some terribly terribly deep and clever secret to the content and sequencing of the text, it is clearly way over my head.The other books in the series are fine, and all deserve 5 stars, but this one should never have slipped past quality control. If you want to wrestle with the Zen-like quality of the non-logic, go right ahead and buy it. If you don't care whether it makes any sense and just want it for the excellent pictures, go right ahead and buy it. Otherwise, give this puppy a miss. Life is confusing enough.

Yep, a lot of purists are raging at the creative liberties taken in this movie, but as a long time Trekkie and certified ST Geek, I have to say that it far, far exceeded my expectations.This is a masterpiece and I don't care how many disgruntled die-hards click their No buttons in response.The casting was inspired and the story, production and direction were second to none.I didn't think anyone could ever play the original cast so credibly, yet in every case, these fine young actors excelled across the board.Nichelle Nichols was a sex bomb in the original series, yet Zoe Saldana managed to rise to job of portraying her in a modern context. Likewise Zachary Quinto was simply flawless as Spock, as was Chris Pine as Kirk.This is essential viewing.

While the Man's erudition is mighty, I have a few concerns about Robert's portrayal of women.If there is a flaw in his thinking, it is that he seems to suggest that strength and femininity are mutually exclusive qualities.Tell that to victorious War leaders Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir and Indira Gandhi.Tell that to Queen Boadicea, who fought to the death against the Roman invaders.Tell that to Queen Elizabeth I, who defied the oncoming Spanish Armada, as she told her assembled troops - "I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field...".Tell that to French Resistance leader Lucie Aubrac, who planned and led a successful assault on the Nazi convoy that was taking her husband to his place of execution - even though she was five months pregnant at the time. She gave birth to her daughter within days of landing at a covert operations base in England, after the Aubracs had hidden for three months, waiting to escape.Tell that to the female US fighter and bomber crews, who have been flying combat missions since the nineties.Perhaps Robert's most worrying suggestion is that mothers cannot give boys the "hardness" they need while growing up without sacrificing their femininity, and the idea that a mother's influence can be undermining to a young male's development in the absence of a strong father figure. Yet mythology (Perseus, Parsifal etc.) and real life are full of male figures who became the epitome of virile masculinity, despite being brought up by a single mother or a group of women. One notable modern example being ultra-macho Rocker John Kay of Steppenwolf, who made a daring escape from Communist-held East Germany with his single mother, Elsbeth, in 1948. In his autobiography "Magic Carpet Ride", Kay is quick to honour her and women in general, precisely because they CAN simultaneously provide nurturing and strength.Robert Bly is not alone in falling into these gender bias traps. Many male (and female) authors do. For this reason, I have always worked with a female editor. However, I would still recommend the book very highly, despite this one blind spot. After all, we don't have Battered Women's Shelters because of men like Robert Bly and Alan Alda.

Small? By the time of the final French collapse, the area left in their hands was virtually the size of a baseball diamond.This book, along with End Of The Line:The Seige Of Khe Sanh, is absolutely essential reading for anybody who wants to understand some of the key differences between the Western and Vietnamese approaches to combat and politics.While nobody could doubt the courage of the French soldiers, who were plunged into a cauldron of Death by a group of arrogant and totally out of touch leaders, you cannot fail to admire the courage and skill of a relentless and ingenious Enemy.The idea of setting up a base in a remote valley to draw in Enemy units and destroy them, was fatally flawed for several reasons. As the book shows, one of them being the failure to conceive of the VM's ability to deploy significant numbers of artillery pieces and anti-aircraft units so quickly and so far away.Yet the real nail in the French coffin lay in the fact that unlike the British and Americans, the French had no strategic heavy bombers. By comparison, the Air operation (Operation Niagara) in support of the Marine garrison at Khe Sanh in 1968 (during the Tet offensive) began with a strike by 36 B-52 bombers, each carrying a 30 ton payload.The small single-engined French planes could barely carry any weapons load, especially at such extreme range. Even then, they often fell prey to the radar-predicted flak that nobody believed the VM could deploy. Naturally, it was all courtesy of the Communist Chinese.Fall gives you a tremendous overview of the entire disaster, from the political machinations to the ghastly conditions on the base. One of the commanders who had refused extra artillery before the main battle began, shot himself. The desperate measures employed by the French included dropping two tanks in pieces, which the Army engineers assembled on the ground, and which caused havoc among the VM until they were overwhelmed by suicide squads, firing point blank into the observation slits and rolling grenades down the barrels of the guns.Hell indeed. Not just for the troops, but for the hopelessly overworked doctor, who had to crawl over a pile of amputated limbs to reach his bunk.As another reviewer mentioned, the French finally had to beg for US air support, and while the US decided not to commit carrier-based strike aircraft (they also decided against a tactical nuclear strike because of the danger to French troops), they did provide the French with a squadron of B-26's, two of which were shot down on the first raid by radar-controlled flak, at 10,000 feet. While these bombers may have made some difference had they arrived much earlier, the writing was really on the wall from Day One.A disaster, yes, and it should have been a wake up call. The clowns who sent US troops into Nam in the early sixties should have known that you cannot fight a vague holding operation against such a resourceful and fanatical enemy. The only reason the US fatalities did not far exceed 58,000 is because of the massive tactical and strategic air support that the French simply never had. Equally, the US helicopter force provided a level of mobility and close air support that simply did not exist at the time of Dien Bien Phu. The same helicopters saved countless lives by (usually) rapidly evacuating wounded to field hospitals where they could receive urgently needed surgery.Imagine Vietnam without the Hueys, the B-52's, the Phantoms, the Skyraiders, the AC-130's, the miniguns, the firebases, the Daisy Cutters, the cluster munitions, the Fuel-Air bombs, the napalm, the phosporous, the satellite photographs, the U-2 and SR-71 flights, the night vision equipment, the armoured units, the God-bless-'em-all men AND women who sewed everybody back together, and you will have some idea of what the French boys faced at Dien Bien Phu.As somebody else rightly said, it's a pity none of the US "planners" ever actually read anything about the French experience.An essential book.

Finally a DVD package that is worthy of this Disney masterpiece, and one that takes you behind the scenes with the truly incomparable Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.While they each made many memorable movies, this is one that really showcases their almost unique combination of talents. I seriously doubt that there was another couple in Hollywood who could have even done half the job that Dick and Julie did in this utter classic.This is one of those rare movies that really is as good as you have heard. While I think it was Variety magazine at the time who described the English accents as 'lamentable', for me, as a former Brit, they almost add to the charm, guv'nor.A cast made in heaven, stunning sets, costumes, impeccable direction and production, some of the best songs and dance routines you could possibly wish for - Van Dyke's sheer genius is a joy to behold - all add up to one magical experience that simply should not be missed.Julie also worked closely with the brilliant Pamela Travers in order to do justice to the author's creation, and the two really hit it off. The results of her thoughtful collaboration are here to see and savor.Whether you see the movie as Pamela's homage to the transforming power of the Feminine on the eve of woman suffrage, or just a stunning piece of solid family entertainment (and we could sure use a whole lot more of that, especially these days) Mary Poppins delivers beyond your wildest dreams.It may be a no brainer to say this, but for more Julie, The Sound Of Music is a must, and for another Dick Van Dyke showcase (including a masterful, complex dance routine), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is also essential viewing.Then of course, you should really watch the superb David Tomlinson and the divine Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks... sigh... so much brilliance, so little time...This 40th anniversary (sheesh, I remember its original release) edition is a welcome boost for the Mary Poppins fans, and one that I simply cannot fault. Two absolutely magical people; one absolutely magical movie.

(With apologies to Byron.) The first time I ever saw a picture of the Mediaeval Baebes I thought some recording industry guru was attempting the folk/classical equivalent of Robert Palmer's &quot;Addicted To Love&quot; video... i.e. take a dozen impossibly beautiful women and form a gimmick band to cash in on their looks. Fifteen seconds into the first track from their first album, Salva Nos, and all illusions had been shattered. These women were the real thing.The Rose is yet another classic album from the Baebes, and features one of the most exquisite pieces of cover art I have ever seen. If you have never heard the band, I would respectfully suggest that you listen to tracks 3 and 4 for a sample of what they can do. Track 3, Slay Me Suddenly, is an example of classic Baebes, with the most beautifully sung intricate vocals overlaying a typically intriguing musical track. Track 4, The Snake, follows through strongly, with a vocal trio by that truly Divine Trinity, Rachel Van Asch, Katharine Blake and Audrey Evans.The icing on the cake is the stunning six-minute closing number, Blow Northern Wind, which is quite simply one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded. Originally a 12-woman band, the Baebes are currently down to nine impossibly beautiful women, and the excellent booklet features a very classy full-page photo of each Baebe. Sigh.

We've come a long way since the divine Sylvia Sims and Dirk Bogarde shook up the entertainment world with the movie Victim - the first ever powerful challenge to the madness of the homosexuality laws.The fact that this series even exists is very reassuring, and on the whole, it has been exceptionally well done. I tend to think that Season One stuck in people's minds more as it was still new and relatively groundbreaking, but Season Two is in no way inferior.While this is not a complaint, I have always found this to be a visually idealized lesbian group, as I live in a town with a major LGBT community, and I would say 80% of the lesbians have short hair. Two of 'em are good plumbers, too. Still, lesbian actress Guinevere Turner (Go Fish, Chasing Amy, American Psycho, Preaching To The Perverted, Beyond Lovely) is classically feminine with 'big hair', so the girls are certainly out there.Nice job.

Ee done a fine job on this ere book, Mr. Cordingly.Okay, I won't do the entire review in costume, but having just watched the incomparable Johnny Depp in Pirates Of The Caribbean, I'm definitely in a piratical frame of mind. Arrrrrr.This is a superb piece of research, and while it can be a little dry and academic in places, for those of us who have a pirate thing going on, David has done us proud with this powerhouse of information.As other shipmates have mentioned, he also includes Mary Read and Ann(e) Bonny, who were part of Calico Jack Rackham's crew - with Bonny being his common law wife.Any of you who have seen the Depp classic, will remember that when you see the Black Pearl's Jolly Roger flag unfurled, it is the unmistakable skull and crossed swords of Calico Jack. When I put my company Five Ships Ltd together (www.fiveships.com) some years ago, we adopted Rackham's flag as our company logo. Arrrrrrrr.... Rex Quondam Rexque Futurus - King That Was, King That Will Be.One of the few omissions from David's book is the fact that the pirate skull and crossed bones/swords is actually the Ancient Egyptian sign of Osiris Risen, with all of its rebirth/resurrection imagery. For the very same reasons, it was the battle flag of the Knights Templar, and when the Templar fleet escaped from La Rochelle as the Pope and the French King moved against the Templars in 1307, they flew the skull and bones as an act of defiance.Still, this is a superb book, if a trifle conventional, and an absolutely essential purchase for those of us who love the smell of burning merchantmen in the morning... Smells like victory...

Well, that would be one valid alternate title for this album, as the exquisitely photographed cover art and Sarah photos testify. Sarah is living proof that women are like fine wine, they just get better with age. I don't think she has ever looked this good. I don't think anybody has ever looked this good.Similarly, her vocal talents continue to mature and expand into new areas. This is a wonderful album and in some ways a difficult one to classify. Still, whether it be World, EuroPop or Thinking Person's Dance, it contains some of Sarah's best work to date. For some reason her Kate Bush qualities seem to be way more evident on this album, although her accidental similarities to Kate's voice have always been there, such as on the Dive album - Captain Nemo etc.Favorite tracks? Hmmm, probably Harem, It's A Beautiful Day, The Journey Home, Free, Mysterious Days, Arabian Nights and Beautiful, but believe me, there isn't a single dud track on Harem.Getting the insanely talented Jaz Coleman on board to do the orchestrations was another stroke of genius, which gives Harem a depth and a level of highly cultured hipness that few albums ever attain. Jaz (there are ten thousand orchestras in those guitars) Coleman is a very accomplished classical composer, but his days fronting the New Wave/Metal band Killing Joke (Love Like Blood) have given him an edge that helps to lift this album onto another level. Inspired choice, Sarah.2004 should see the release of the long -awaited new Kate Bush album. On the heels of this utter masterpiece from Sarah, and Afterglow from Sarah MacLachan, Kate's album will complete the divine trinity. We are truly blessed.This is Sarah Brightman at her best and a true classic.

My apologies for writing a second review of this classic tape, but I just wanted to add a couple of things...Firstly, for those who might have surfed in vain, the Five and Dime, the 510th Evacuation Hospital, never actually existed. There was a US military facility at China Beach, but it was an R & R facility, having no surgical units, unlike Cam Ranh Bay, for example, which did have the 12th USAF Hospital, until 1972. To be correct, I think it became the 483rd in 1969, but it seems to have been referred to as the 483rd/12th USAF Hospital until its departure in 1972.China Beach is based partly on the late Lynda Van Devanter's book, Home Before Morning: The Story Of An Army Nurse In Vietnam (available through Amazon.com) and is something of a composite of a number of different people's experiences.Some female Vets have reservations about the series, and I totally respect them. Those brave women were actually there, and at some risk to their own lives. The 6th CC at Cam Ranh Bay was attacked by VC sappers in 1969 and about 20 buildings were destroyed, in one of which, two Army Nurses were only saved by a faulty fuse on the satchel charge that was thrown through their window. The Enemy's 'legitimate target' list included the chapel and the nurses' hooches. Geneva what?Flaws or not, China Beach is a wonderful tribute to the courageous men and women who took care of the wounded from a largely conscript Army, whose average age was 19 (in WW II it was 26).While they may not always have been treated as Vets, the Army, Air Force and Navy nurses who served in Vietnam are legally recognized as Veterans, having been part of the military, although some combat vets seem reluctant to recognize them as 'real vets'. Maybe they should watch China Beach.As a footnote, the American Red Cross women (who appear in some China Beach episodes), including the SRAO field personnel (the Donut Dollies), who often took considerable risks, flying out to Fire Bases and Landing Zones all over VN, are not recognized as Veterans by the Government, by virtue of their 'civilian' status. Even though many of them still suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.Maybe the Government should watch China Beach, too.All of the women who served in Vietnam are Veterans. For those who went out with the USO, like the wonderful Martha Raye and Connie Stevens, there should also be an Honorary Veteran category. Ooops, just thinking aloud...

Superb. The entire series should be made available, but as yet, even this little gem is not available on DVD.While I am also a big Dana fan, I was blown away by the level of realism and the sheer quality of the acting throughout this flawlessly executed epic series. A pre-Star Trek: Voyager Robert Picardo was one of the mainstays in a show that almost made MASH seem trivial by comparison - even given that MASH was a comedy.This really is intense drama at its best, and the character depth and quality performances from Dana, Robert and an outrageously talented cast made this a classic series by any definition.On following China Beach (the real location is now a leading Vietnamese tourist resort), you simply cannot help but be appalled that the Army nurses who risked and even gave their lives to save countless teenage soldiers, had to fight for Vet status for many years.In a God-forsaken country in which every square inch was the front line, the courageous men and women at the Five and Dime showed how the human spirit can triumph in even the most overwhelming circumstances.For me, Delaney and Picardo never topped these stunning performances, although I would watch literally anything that they appear in. This all-too-brief tape serves as a reminder of just how good television can be.Haunting.

I have only just seen this movie, partly because I began to lose interest after Insurrection, and partly because of the overall negative reviews.However, Nemesis is certainly worth watching, even if it is a little formulaic; although there are a number of questionables, many of which have been pointed out by other fans.For me, the recurring idiocy is the idea of being defenseless against a cloaked ship. Hello, the second the ship fired, even a modern-day military computer and radar system could pinpoint the exact source of the shot, and provide counterattack coordinates to the ship under fire. Even if you can't see the ship, you can see the point of emanation.As for using up all of the photon torpedoes in a single relatively brief engagement; as another fan pointed out, this is simply ridiculous.Please watch the movie and make up your own mind. It's better than Insurrection, but not a 'great' movie, like First Contact or any of the Classic Trek epics.There's certainly the possibility of a sequel built into the ending, but after the disappointing box office for Nemesis, they will need to be very sure they have a winner before they put anything else together. Especially since the sequel would be an odd-numbered movie...

I must confess, I watched the film after reading Grady's wonderful review, as he and I are usually in synch; and it even exceeded my expectations.While the movie is visually spectacular from the opening scene, it is the way it weaves this haunting tale of the divine Feminine that stays with you long after the closing credits.Not only do the three generations of women represent the Mother Maiden Crone form of the Triple Goddess, the latter day Maria appears in red sneakers, corresponding to Dorothy's red shoes from the Wizard of Oz - in both cases, representing the moonblood of the sacred Feminine.Even the one graphic sex/love scene between Aurea and Massu is beautifully and tastefully filmed, and the passion is entirely believable, down to the subtle capture of Fernanda Torres's erect nipples.The film's many themes, including the futility of doing or not-doing, give the viewer much to consider as they feast on this masterpiece of acting, cinematography, casting, production, direction, you name it.This is a must-see film by any standards.

A stunning performance from one of the best actors in the business. The Machinist is both an exceptional and haunting exploration of the way the mind deals with guilt, and an unforgettable vehicle for the genius of Christian Bale.From the early glimpses of Kafka's The Castle and Dostoevsky's The Idiot, in Reznik's apartment, we sense that this is going to be one dark ride into the abyss; and it is.Yet there is a beauty and a symmetry to the ending that is ultimately uplifting, despite its tragic inevitability. I don't want to give away any plot details, so I would just urge you to watch this masterpiece for yourselves.A modern classic.

An unforgettable movie that is as important and as powerful today as when it was first released.Shute took his title from a stanza from T S Eliot's The Hollow Men:-In this last of meeting placesWe grope togetherAnd avoid speechGathered on this beach of the tumid river...The tumid (swollen) river is metaphorical, as is the beach, given that Eliot's bleak, desolate landscape is a spiritual one, as in his classic work, The Wasteland.Shute's movie is utterly compelling all the way through, partly due to the subject matter, helped along by a stunning cast, and very capable production and direction.The scene in which the Sub arrives in the US to check on the erratic morse signal was actually shot in Australia, as they could not obtain permission to film it in the US.There was a very creditable 2000 Showtime version with Rachel Ward and Armand Assante, which was truer to the book, although set closer to present time, but the Peck version is still the definitive one.You cannot top this movie for dramatic content, brilliantly delivered by Peck, Gardner, Perkins and Astaire above all.Yes, this could still happen, and yes, nuclear deterrence may well have worked so far, but I always remember a line from Bob Dylan's &quot;If God's On Our Side&quot;, which goes...If God's on our side,He'll stop the next war...Maybe he did.Peace y'all.

If Fallen doesn't go down as an all time Goth Classic, Jacques Chirac will be the next President of the United States. (Ain't gonna happen.)Amy Lee's voice is right up there with other Goth Goddesses, such as Tina Root of Switchblade Symphony and Katharine Blake of Miranda Sex Garden.Whether she's soaring over a Static-X-style wall of guitars as on Going Under or delivering breathtaking vocals on an exquisite ballad such as My Immortal, Amy never ceases to hold your attention. And let's face it, she even looks like a Goth Goddess.A stunning debut. Best Goth album I've heard since Serpentine Gallery.

A hauntingly beautiful film about human alienation and how the mind deals with guilt. Yet another true masterpiece of Australian cinema.There is so much imagery in the movie that it is difficult to know where to start in describing it, but the brilliantly filmed uses of water are the centerpiece. When Guy Pearce's character is finally able to lay Silvy's ghost to rest, he does so in symbolic fashion, sending her out on a boat to the Otherworld, just as the Nordic warrior dead were sent out on burning boats to Valhalla. His peace of mind comes in her return to the Earth Mother.There is a magic about the relationship between the young Sam and Silvy that is captured in a breathtakingly beautiful fashion in this masterpiece of direction.The title is taken from the last line of T. S. Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, which ends, "Till human voices wake us, and we drown." There has been a great deal of discussion of what Eliot meant by the poem as a whole and by the enigmatic last line, in particular. My own interpretation, with which I ended the Postscript of my 2009 novel One Star Awake, is that once we stop embracing the Sacred Feminine, the Truth that sustains us is lost... and we `drown' in the illusion of fear, despair and alienation.Sam's bitter-sweet feelings of loss and desolation are only resolved when he re-dedicates Silvy's soul and memory to the Great Mother, the Universal Consciousness, as symbolized by the water.Exquisite.

'Thoughts are tyrants that come back again and again to torment us...'While I think all the versions have something to recommend them, especially Larry Olivier's, this is my favorite by far.To me, this is the most Gothic, right down to the inspired choice of the partially turreted building that serves as Wuthering Heights itself. For the record, the word Wuthering came from the local dialect, and describes the action of the wind.Not only are the casting, production and direction first class, the movie also features some richly nuanced performances by Fiennes and Binoche. All of the above is also carried along by a beautiful and haunting film score.Frankly, I have no idea what the critics are babbling about, nor do I care. Highly recommended.

To be honest, my favorite part was the beautiful video 'The Blower's Daughter' by Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan, in the Special Features...Closer is a movie that just doesn't live up to the premise or the potential generated by such an outstanding cast. While it plays with contrasting the Apollonian versus Dionysian energies of the two male characters, and the interplay of the scattered energies that the colliding relationships create, it somehow falls short of working, for me.Yes, it's about the futility of obsession, as was Lolita, and the underlying purity of Natalie Portman's character hints at a tip of the literary hat to Goethe's Faust, but Closer never settles into a believable flow.As far as the plot goes, Jude Law's Dan actually has the chance to be happy with both women at different times, but blows it by obsessing over details and control issues. So does the Sleazy Doc, but in a different way.Life is not about 'cheat but don't tell', it's about 'don't cheat', as Portman's Alice/Jane rightly suggested - that there is always a pivotal moment when you can stop yourself from falling in love inappropriately or creating an inappropriate sexual liaison.Just be glad you are not inside their heads.

Sally Potter is one of the few directors to achieve the near impossible - to create a movie that actually surpasses the original novel.Not wishing to take anything away from Virginia Woolf, whose The Waves is one of the most brilliant and defining novels of all time, Potter's film version is nothing less than a work of art.As other reviewers have indicated, when the Orlando character, who was based on Woolf's friend and lover, Victoria (Vita) Sackville-West, crosses gender to become a woman, she automatically loses the right to own the very same property that, as a man, she/he had owned for eons. Even as a socio-political commentary, (see also Woolf's A Room Of One's Own) this speaks volumes about a patriarchal society in which the lowliest, most moronic male had infinitely more rights than the most brilliant and gifted female.Our society is still dealing with the legacy of the tyranny of gender and the legacy of the Inquisition, in which nine million women were murdered for being women.Yet despite the dark insanities that underly the film's pivotal transition, Potter's modern classic is a rich and joyful romp, filled with love, hope and transcendence, with a simply breathtakingly beautiful closing section.A rare and inspired work of genius, in which the production direction and casting cannot be faulted.

...and I agree with Alastair from my homeland, but I find myself psychologically incapable of giving it less.This seems like a rush job, and given Viv's state of mind at the time, he probably wasn't feeling tip top on any level. Compared to the utter perfection of Rawlinson, this is like Viv larking about. If you can persevere with the album, it does actually get better as it progresses. It never reaches any of the heights that Sir Henry at Rawlinson End achieved and maintained throughout, but there are a few flashes of Vintage Viv in here.Sadly, he was preparing to revisit Rawlinson territory at the time of his untimely death, and given his disappointment with this release (as Alastair indicated) I'm sure he would have given it his best shot.Ndidi's Kraal was not his best shot, it was more like a stray round. Still, in the absence of any more Viv, I chose to, as Sting put it, make the best of what's still around.By all means heed the cautions folks, but please give it a listen.

Smell The Rain is a classic album, and a showcase for Mortiis's versatility.Rain gives us everything from driving industrial, such as Flux/Mental Maelstrom, with its 'machine gun' bass/guitar line, to hauntingly beautiful gothic ballads such as Everyone Leaves.He is so highly regarded in his native Norway that the album The Grudge is carried by libraries as a government requirement, based on its cultural value.Yes, he's gone heavy folks, and he's done it with style.

Threshold is unquestionably one of the greatest albums of all time. Back in the UK in 1969, if you wore an RAF greatcoat and carried Threshold or a Led Zep album under your arm, you were most definitely considered 'hip'.Everything about this superb album, from the haunting cover art to the incredible song selection screams out 'Classic!' This is one of those albums that really illustrates the collective genius that made the band so strong, with every member contributing some stunning material.I remember at the time that Lovely To See You and Dear Diary seemed to be playing everywhere you ever went; but they are just two of the many unforgettable songs that stamped the Moodies' authority on the progessive music scene.The breathtaking Never Comes The Day (which is also covered on Moody Bluegrass) is another Hayward classic and a foretaste of the endless genius to come in masterpieces such as New Horizons, from Seventh Sojourn.That this incredible album should close with one of Mike's most majestic epic pieces is just the icing on the cake.What a band.

A superb film that definitely benefits from being seen in its full version. As other reviewers have done such a good job of describing the contents, I just wanted to allay the concerns of some potential viewers.Some people have used variants of the word 'pedophilia' in describing the interactions between the 12 year-old played so brilliantly by Portman, and Leon. This is an inappropriate use of this often mis-used word. The Direction here is such that there is no exploitative footage, and while the story's Lolita undercurrents are clearly there, they do not detract from what is a superb thriller and action movie.Such irresponsible mis-uses of the word ironically undermine the seriousness of true pedophilia which often involves children under the age of five, which is truly sick and obscene.Portman's streetwise 12 year-old should not make anybody feel uncomfortable. She is a fine actress and this is a fine movie.

Having listened to this album repeatedly, I can only assume that the one and two star reviews are protest votes, in that they do not in any way reflect the quality of this latest Kate offering.Some of the tracks on Disc 1, A Sea of Honey, are impressive first time through, such as King of the Mountain, Bertie and Joanni, and the more sombre A Coral Room is classic Kate-at-the-piano material.I found that How to be Invisible came on board second time through, and there are some more challenging tracks, such as Pi with its stream of numbers and Mrs. Bartolozzi, with its Joycean rambling, but this is still a strong album.Disc 2, A Sky of Honey, is something of a concept piece, rather like The Ninth Wave, although without the Wave's intensity. I tend to put this disc on in the way I would put on a Philip Glass album. There is a maturity about this very classy double album that is very gratifying, and I hope that Kate sees it as the artistic success that it so clearly is.

A classic. Based on Leslie Thomas's awesome novel about National Servicemen serving in the Far East (the US had The Draft, the Brits and Aussies had National Service).The bored troops, who are based in Singapore in 1950, are mainly focused on scoring with the Regimental Sergeant Major's daughter, played by a very hot Lynn Redgrave. Hywel Bennett, a major UK TV actor, is the male lead.A chilling title, when you think that so many of the kids that have been shipped off to fight wars for eons usually went out as literally virgin soldiers. I spent time at RAF Kai Tak (near Kowloon Bay) in Hong Kong in 1971 (The RAF base in Singapore closed the previous year) and I met UK and US and Aussie troops during that time. The US and Oz used Hong Kong for R & R, being less than 1,000 miles from Nam.The bottom line, is that all the young troops had the idea at the back of their minds that it might be a race to lose their viginities before they were KIA. How the heck can you be out there putting your life on the line, never having known a woman?Rant over. This movie is superb, and even features a cameo by a young David Bowie, who stumbles past the camera as a drunken young soldier in a bar scene.Fun, drama, Juicy Lucy (played by the divine Tsai Chin), what more do ya want?

Naw, Still Crazy is a little more serious than Spinal Tap, but this magical movie has no shortage of humor throughout.I'd followed Bill Nighy for years before this movie, so he was a revelation as a rock singer, right down to having a decent voice as well as exceptional stagecraft. Still Crazy is a well conceived and executed movie, that I can watch over and over again.The casting was simply flawless with Spall, Connolly, Rea and Nail all giving 1000%, as the band. The only curious piece of casting was Juliet Aubrey. Don't get me wrong, she's a superb actress and a goddess into the bargain, but she was cast as a woman who was supposed to be at least in her early forties, whereas she was only about 29 when the movie was made. Still, she carries it off, as did Helena and the boys, and with a superb collection of seventies-sounding songs, the band are totally believable, both on and off the stage.As for band politics and conflicts... been there, done that, so I know how bang-on this all is.One of the best movies I have ever seen.

Well I'm feeling pretty good after finally having the sense to just go out and buy this superb album.This really is an exceptional album, and a showcase for Peter's guitar mastery. His playing has matured to a frightening degree, and the sheer class almost overwhelms you. Likewise his vocals are as strong as ever, yet his phrasing is more subtle, adding to the impact of this superb collection of songs.Lines On My Face is still one of my favorite Frampton songs, and this version is simply stunning. The song selection is awesome, ranging from the Humble Pie classic I Don't Need No Doctor to You Had To Be There, which also appears in the superb Almost Famous movie, in which Peter plays a hilarious cameo as Reg, the Humble Pie manager.The guy just keeps on getting better, folks. Every track is a gem, and there is enough of a variation in styles to make this a very satisfying album all the way through. The classics are in here, with some great newer songs too.A great album from one of the classiest guitarists in the business.

This is a delightful version of the classic story, with some striking performances from Kate Maberly, Maggie Smith and John Lynch above all.I was astonished to read some negative reviews, criticizing everything from child nudity to encouraging paganism.To put things into perspective, there is a brief scene in which the ten-year-old Kate is getting out of the bath, and for a second or so, you can see her right nipple - I do not say 'breast', as she is not in any way developed at this point in her life. As a father of four daughters, I find it bewildering that anyone could even consider this an issue.The only other fleeting glimpse of the young actress's chest comes in the first scene, in which she is being dressed by her servant in India, although this is a more distant shot. I can see how this might be considered gratuitous or unnecessary, but in terms of actual content, it barely constitutes even partial nudity.The pagan reference is presumably the brief scene in which the young Colin makes up a chant to bring his father back from a vacation/business trip, as the children and the gardener are sitting around an outdoor fire, at night. The scene followed an earlier innocent discussion of the magic inherent in Life itself and the importance of embracing it, rather than hiding away.The father then has a touching dream in which the spirit of his dead wife calls him back to the garden.Hardly X-rated stuff.This is a lovely version and avoids some of the needlessly dark excesses of some earlier productions.Highly recommended.

It is to the US Military's everlasting shame that they saw fit to persecute and expel a true decorated American war hero. War hero? Well what would you call an Army Nurse (24th Evac., Long Binh) who worked tirelessly to save the lives of teenage soldiers in an insanely busy surgical unit, where the word "Incoming" could mean more than the next influx of wounded.The movie understatedly captures how Cammermeyer (Bronze Star)and her nursing staff, and their Red Cross sisters (the Red Cross women still have no Vet status) risked their lives on a daily basis, never knowing when the next mortar round or 122mm rocket would slam into their Evac hospitals or MUSTs, or as with the 6th Convalescent Center at Cam Ranh Bay, when the VC sappers might attack directly.As a reality check, the first member of the Army Nurse Corps to be killed by direct enemy action was 1 / L Sharon Ann Lane, who died when a Russsian-made 8 inch diameter rocket struck Ward 4 of the 312th Evac at Chu Lai.8 Army Nurses died in Vietnam.That a true blue American woman, like Cammermeyer, who had given so much to so many should be driven out of the service that she loved because of something so pathetic as her orientation is perhaps the greatest indictment of a system that is full of double standards.Close and Davis were simply magnificent, and the only way in which this movie goes out to shock is by accurately telling this true tale of unimaginable injustice. The only obscenity lay in the outcome of the hearings.There have always been (...) in the military. Always. And there always will be. I was not one of them. I just don't like it when the bad guys win.There's a special place in Heaven for the women who served in Nam. All 15,000 of them. Vets every one.Courage knows no race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.Col. Cammermeyer is presently researching a Don't Ask, Don't Tell project. Best of luck ma'am.

...the last thing on my mind would be whether she had shaved her armpits...Sorry, just had to get that out of the way.European women tend not to be so obsessive about shaving their pits, plus the film was set during the first part of the 20th century.Anyway, this is indeed a gem with a very fine plot twist, and one of the most entertaining modern gothic movies out there. The cast is well-chosen and oozing talent, and the production and direction are worthy of that fine cast.Alas, I have a basic version of the DVD, with no Special Features, but if there is an enhanced version out there, I would certainly seek that out, as any 'Making Of' and interviews would be well worth the viewer's time.As others have said, this is a gem and a very underrated movie.

Back in the seventies, I learned the hard way that you never lend out your Jack albums. While I will never see some of that vinyl again, I welcome the chance to catch up on that and more with the hopefully ever-increasing CD back catalog.There was something almost mystical about Jack's earlier recordings, and if I had to pick out one album that I would consider my favorite, it would be There's Love... which gave us the Jack anthem And I Love Her.I know we're all going to disagree over his 'best' work, but with an artist of his caliber, you can only really talk about your favorite albums - another classic being Sings Michel Legrand.Last I heard the man is still going strong, and still doing sold-out world tours, and from the last recent photo I saw, he's still outrageously handsome, dang it.A superb double Jack set and from the look of Amazon's excellent database, one of several paired sets. Now I just have to catch up on the rest.Brilliant.

I've always considered Neil to be more of a Rock singer than a Pop singer, not that I have a problem with Pop, but just look at this guy on the classic cover shot.As other fans have said, this is great song after great song, and the man was just in his element in front of this appreciative hardcore audience. I used to have this on vinyl at the time, but like an idiot I leant it out, and it met the same fate as some of my Jack Jones LPs.It's hard to even pick out my favorite songs from this stunning collection, it's just one of those classics that you just have to savor as a whole. I certainly agree that it's one of the greatest live albums of all time, and yes, it has worn better than Peter's Comes Alive album, which mainly dates due to that awful mouth wah wah thingy that he overused.Yep, this is about as good as it gets, and it would make a fantastic Christmas gift for a musically discerning friend or loved one.It's true, good times never seemed so good!

You may well need them.This is utterly hilarious. Seely's recognition of the Zen-like Beyond BushSpeak non-logic of Rumy (not to be confused with the actual poet Rumi!) is masterfully explored in this stunning volume.Any American politician who states openly on TV that it didn't really matter if the UK did not come on board for the invasion of Iraq - as the Brits were preparing to commit their land, sea and air forces to a joint invasion force - has to be examined closely - for any neural activity, for example.Hate him or hate him, Rumy has his Own Way of confusing the unwitting with his non-linear Joycean paradigms. Bush Snr. set the standard with his neologism-ridden BushSpeak, but clearly Rumy has turned out to be the Master of the Absurd.The scary part about this 'existential poetry' is that much of it was lifted as is, and there are many literal quotes, however mind-tricking the meandering, Lewis Carroll on downers logic appears to become.C. Colt's review is a work of art in itself and the best analysis of this Major Force in modern poetry I have yet read. But then, I have yet to read Rumy's psychiatric evaluations.Man, know thyself - AristotleUh? - Donald Rumsfeld.

Daaahlings, what can you say about this High Camp classic that hasn't already been said? On the heels of Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, the divine Tim Curry hammered the final nail into the well-nailed coffin of Establishment gender stereotyping. As you can tell from the audience reactions, the androgynous Doctor Frank persona is as liberating for females as it is for males.A strong collection of songs from maestro Richard O'Brien drives this Gothic masterpiece, concerning the misadventures of (Damn it) Janet Weiss, played by the ravishing Susan Sarandon and her RoboNerd boyfriend Brad Majors, played by Barry Bostwick.There are just so many classic scenes and one liners that I can only respectfully suggest that you just go right ahead and buy this puppy. While the film lures you in with a feast of archetypal significance, you are probably better advised to check your brain at the door and relax with a chill bottle of parafino.It can be easy you know... having a good time...

What a wonderful movie and what a wonderful set of reviews. Stealing Home has definitely struck a chord with a lot of thinking, feeling people.The casting was a work of genius and every member of the cast, of whatever age group, gave 1000%. There are so many fine moments in this classic movie that I can only urge you to buy a copy ASAP. Yet through all the humour, drama, romance and teenage testosterone overload, the bitter-sweet tinge of loss and lost love gives Stealing Home a magical flavour.One of the greatest things about high quality teen love and initiation movies such as Stealing Home and Summer Of 42, is that the viewer can experience the events and the people's lives vicariously. While I cannot relate directly to this type of movie, as I never had any physical relationships in my teens, I can thoroughly enjoy living those moments through the lives of the film characters.This is a very sensitive and intelligent portrayal of the lives of a group of ordinary people, who shared some very special moments. In an industry filled with car chases and shoot outs, Stealing Home shines like a diamond and serves as a reminder of just how good a film can and should be.A true classic.

While the overall tone and style of The Green Berets make it somewhat anachronistic - especially the ghastly, but mercifully brief "chorale" at the end - it still contains some elements that make it a watchable VietNam movie.All politics aside, this was The Duke's from-the-heart tribute to the men and women serving in Nam, who were quite unjustly being blamed for the machinations of the military-industrial complex.No, the situation was not as straightforward as TGB suggests, but the movie does give you something of a feel for the nature of jungle warfare, such as the cover and point methods of moving through areas that were often laced with booby traps and snipers.Having had a lecture on VC booby traps from a field engineer from 1 ATF (Phuoc Tuy province) in 1971, (I was not with the military) I couldn't understand how anybody ever survived a month, let alone a tour. This movie goes some way towards showing how effective these devices could be, and how they could even account for 40% of casualties in some units.TGB wasn't just a piece of shameless flag waving by The Duke, it was an attempt to humanize the War and make people care about the individual soldiers above all, at a time when the Communist hijack of the Peace Movement had made many people shun the returning troops and label them "baby killers". Even though it was the VC who were sometimes booby trapping live babies in order to kill American soldiers.If America feels guilt about VietNam, it should primarily be for the way it abandoned its young men to the Communist-led jackals of the "don't think, just chant something" sixties.The returning troops, whose average age was nineteen (just think of all the eighteen and nineteen year olds you know) heard all manner of hateful derision and ridicule back in the World.The one thing they didn't hear was the one thing they SHOULD have heard...Welcome home, brothers and sisters.That is why The Duke made this movie, and for that reason alone, it has value.

This makes a wonderful companion volume to Reagan's War (see my review "The man who slayed the Evil Empire") as the two together give you a combination of insights that is unsurpassed.With the appalling atmosphere being generated in the present election run-up, it is rather sobering to reflect on how a truly GREAT American conducted himself. Honorable was a word used by another reviewer and that sums The Ron up.He didn't set out to win elections by dredging up dubious dirt on his opponent, he set out to win simply by being BETTER than his opponent. And he was.Like Winston Churchill, whose mother was American, Ron loved his country very deeply and fought to defend it and everything it stood for with a clarity and a strength and a passion that we simply have not seen since.George Bush Jr. scraped through in the last election, and if he wins this one, it will have been because his PR crew relied on pitting Vietnam Vet against Vietnam Vet while his unworthy running mate is once again a five-time draft dodger.Ron wasn't even a combat veteran, nor was Margaret Thatcher, but they had a strength of vision and an integrity and a love of democracy that inspired those who were.When Baroness Thatcher curtsied at Ron's funeral, it was the ultimate compliment to a great man, and a great American, the likes of whom we may never see again.I hope I'm wrong.

A deceptively powerful movie. As others have rightly said, the abduction scenes and the onboard experimentation scenes above all are chillingly believable. Yet for me, the key element that makes this a very convincing account of a genuine alien abduction, is the way the superb Sweeney and Patrick portray their characters.The men act like Vietnam Vets who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They shared a common traumatic experience, like the men and women who served in Nam. As with Vietnam Syndrome, people who have never been through the experience could never duplicate or understand what they went through. Thus they became alienated from the community.The footnote which confirms that the men re-took PolyGraph tests that indicated that they had been telling the truth, speaks for itself.

A decent book, which loosely suggests a maze-like labyrinthine feel during the story evolution; but this is more implied than actively structured, unlike the way Emily Bronte consciously used structure in Wuthering Heights.Just as when men try to write about female characters, there are some shallow and stereotypical touches, especially regarding Larry's sexuality. His instantly responsive penis is the stuff of fantasy, as many men experience erection loss the first time or two with a new woman, and often during the very first time having sex.While he shows a number of stereotypical reactions to the onset of middle age and the theatrical trauma of hitting forty, there is no recognition of the fact that a man with Larry's quasi-morbidity would be experiencing levels of erectile dysfunction from his late twenties onwards.As with The Stone Diaries, Carol tends to write epics about people who simply do not lead epic lives, even in their own heads, and Larry's Party is such a novel.Despite the inherent flaws and the tendency towards over-writing, I still consider it worth a read.

This is a fine adaptation of one of Ray Bradbury's most enchanting books, and with Ray's narration and the incomparable Mr. Spock himself as Mr. Moundshroud, this is a first class production.The literally haunting journey through Time into the history of Halloween across various cultures is both highly educational and spookily entertaining.Through it all, Ray's reverence for Life itself and the importance of love, friendship and self-sacrifice just shines like a jewel in this thought-provoking masterpiece.The beautiful, uplifting ending that made the book such a classic is well captured here, as all ends well, and everyone grows from the experience, as it should be in Life.This is a powerful and intriguing movie that is a feast for kids and adults alike.

An excellent, well-cast movie that manages to entertain without inane car chases and explosions.This is a fine movie and a great piece of casting, with the superb Joan Cusack as Casey's Mom, and the divine Kim Cattrall as Tina. Kim is a perfect choice for Tina the former skate star, having the athletic physique and the beauty that one associates with ice goddesses such as Michelle Kwan, who makes a delightful cameo as a commentator.I was already a Michelle Trachtenberg fan from her days as Sarah Michelle Gellar's younger sister in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and she is absolutely perfect for the role of Casey.The intelligent ending provides a classic platform for a cracking sequel, which I hope they will make with the same core cast.

There has been a lot of valid criticism, but I must say, I really enjoyed the movie. Yeah, it's a no brainer, but I love the Wayans anyway, so I was rooting for them before I even saw it. To me, it's just the boys laughing at the human ability to create issues out of irrelevant things like race and gender.Talented as the Wayans are, the superb Terry Crews almost steals the show as Latrell Spencer, right down to his Eighties pickup lines, robotic dancing and his singing of Vanessa Carlton's A Thousand Miles, which appears more than once in the movie. The most entertaining appearance was when the 'girls' and their three friends are heading out in an exotic open-top car and the song comes on the radio; which they sing along with, before switching to a 50 Cent rap number.Stage actress Jennifer Carpenter again grabs the limelight in a brilliant performance as the weight/body image obsessed Lisa. The scene in which 'Shawn' is watching her change into a stunning black outfit is hilarous, but also undesrcores the point that many women who are already slim and beautiful have poor self-image due to all manner of insane social pressures.This is probably the ultimate guys dressing as gals movie in so far as it is gutsy enough to try some very experimental makeup techniques, of the kind normally reserved for Alien characters in Sci Fi movies. While the guys don't actually end up looking much like the Wilson sisters, if you can suspend your disbelief for long enough you can just enjoy the crazy events as they unfold.It's a complete BabeFest too, right down to the inevitable Bad Girls played by the stunning Jaime King and Brittany Daniel. The Making Of and other Features are superb and give you a sense of the fun the whole cast had making this movie.Nope this isn't High Art, but then it was never supposed to be.

While Marillion were always dogged by the Genesis Clone label, they really were an excellent band in their own right. The quality of the songwriting and musicianship is particularly strong on this, their magical debut.The first thing to grab you about Marillion is the haunting cover art of the superb Mark Wilkinson, who continued to work with fellow genius, Fish, after the big fella left Marillion. (Their lavishly illustrated book Masque is an absolutely essential purchase.)Script is one of those rare albums where every single track is a classic. Yet this double CD version is most definitely the one to go for, as Disc 2 contains further indispensible classics, such as Market Square Heroes (2 versions), the breathtaking Three Boats Down From The Candy (which perhaps more than any other track truly encapsulates the very core of Fish-Marillion's magic) and the epic Grendel, which has been described as their Supper's Ready.Just as Genesis carried on in name only when Peter Gabriel left, so too Marillion continued to (legitimately) use the name after Fish moved on. However, in each case, however well the remaining band members rallied and put out solid albums, a large part of the original magic left with the lead singers.If you only ever buy one Marillion album, let this be it... but... why stop at only one?I agree with reviewer Jorge that it is sad there had been no previous reviews of such a fine and defining album. It would be a tragedy if the original band and this magical album should be forgotten.

is not an option. This is a brilliantly if outrageously scripted vehicle for Duchovny's unique delivery and a delight to watch.I have seen all three seasons and they are all exceptionally well written, acted, directed etc. The casting was a stroke of genius and the heavy integration of street language seemingly adds to the flow as it did in the Jeff Bridges masterpiece The Big Lebowski.Yes, there is a great deal of swearing, nudity and adult situations, but as an adult show it is utterly hilarious. It is important to see the show as a caricature or parody of the very sex/drugs/rock and roll lifestyle that it depicts, yet writer Tom Kapinos always manages to balance the futile, one-dimensional sex addiction with sensitive insights and life lessons.

Mary being the lingerie saleswoman dressed in red... In the Lampoon tradition of Christie Brinkley, the divine Nicolette Scorsese provided Chevy's Fantasy Babe interest in this excellent movie. The scene in which Randy Quaid's beer swilling Cousin Eddie transitions into Nicolette, standing on a diving board and teasing Clark, as she peels off a hot red swimsuit is just one of a thousand laughs in this utter classic.With a cast like this you can't really go wrong, and Brian Doyle Murray (Bill Murray's older brother) plays his Scrooge role flawlessly.Hard to pick out my favorite crazy scene, although the sequence in which Clark goes on an unwitting death ride in a super slippy saucer sled (hey, how about that alliteration?) is certainly a major thigh slapper.The Special Features are rather limited, and for some reason Chevy is absent from the track Commentary, which is entertainingly handled by Bev and Randy etc.Definitely a classic.

Hey, little girl... Dang, every line just burns its way into your consciousness. This is a classic Jack double set (one of several) and contains many unforgettable songs.While the Greatest Hits compilation is superb, there are so many stunning songs on this set that weren't even 45s, that you simply cannot get your head around how utterly brilliant this man really is.It's not just that he has a golden, smooth smooth smooth voice, with an almost operatic range, it's that he is never afraid of taking chances with his phrasing and delivery, which makes for some very exciting performances. What Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant did for Rock vocals, Jack did for the crooners. He just transformed the entire concept.Added to that, he recorded some of the greatest songs ever written, and did it HIS way. Just pick a song off this powerhouse double set and you'll see what I mean... even the songs off Wives And Lovers alone... Wives and Lovers (of course) Toys In The Attic, Angel Eyes, the haunting Charade and Nina Never Knew, Summertime Promises, his stunningly original cover of Fly Me To The Moon... you get the idea.This man is one class act, and this is an essential purchase.

This is a brilliant adaptation of classic Dark Dahl by the genius who gave us David Bowie's The Man Who Fell To Earth.The cast, which includes Rowan Atkinson as the hotel manager and Jane Horrocks as the Grand High Witch's assistant, is exceptional, but Anjelica totally steals the show with the camped-up Goth Goddess performance that she later adapted for her stunning Morticia role in The Addams Family.Whereas Morticia has a warm personality, in The Witches, Anjelica is an ice queen, and probably quite scary to younger children. A stunning performance from one of the most talented actresses and one of the most physically perfect women on the planet.I just wish there had been some extra features, such as behind the scenes interviews. Still, it's an essential purchase.

Of all of Virginia's diaries (there are five volumes), volumes 3 and 4 are perhaps the most interesting, if only because they span the period in which she wrote her classics such as Orlando, To The Lighthouse, and The Waves (which itself literally spans the period between Vol 3 and Vol 4.)If you read the collected Diaries and Woman Of Letters by Phyllis Rose, you will gain a vital series of insights into the life and thoughts of this most haunting of female writers.Whenever I think of Virginia, I always think of the lines from &quot;Vincent&quot; by Don Maclean...This world was never meantfor one as beautiful as you...If you have never read any Virginia Woolf, I would respectfully suggest you rent a copy of Sally Potter's Orlando. While Sally takes artistic license with the novel, she has created a very sympathetic work of Art.This diary above all gives you many insights into her thought processes and her writing career, including her reactions to the publication of her works and their reception by the public and the sub-species known as Critics.Recommended.

Finally on DVD. Love it. I first saw this mistresspiece about the same time as the equally wacky, sex-drenched Tromeo and Juliet (What? You didn't know Juliet had a lesbian lover?), and it has lost none of its magic.Other reviewers have described it well, so I won't overkill the story line. While this is a lightweight look at the S & M industry/subculture, it is genuinely entertaining, with Chris Anholt (Tia Carrere's sidekick in Relic Hunter) perfectly cast opposite the Divine Guin Turner - check out Go Fish and Chasing Amy.Apart from being sheer entertainment with a great soundtrack, the movie captures the madness by which corrupt and perverse Government officials presume to judge a subculture in which the genderless, non-hierarchical role-playing is actually very sane and healing.Hilarious, sexy, exciting. I hope they make a sequel with the same cast.

...which has perhaps generated more hostility than would otherwise have been the case.While it's important to challenge some of the more outlandish conspiracy theories, it is also important to be open to the 'Oswald did it, but consciously or not, he was not the only gunman' idea. To me, that willingness does not come across in Posner's book.If this book has an overall weakness, it is Posner's tendency to accept official data at face value, including ballistic and medical evidence, and even the audio tape on which he alleges you can hear the shots and their time frame. One of the big problems here, is that this does not take into account the use of silenced weapons, which would have unquestionably been used in the event of an actual conspiracy. The way Posner dismisses this viable scenario is quite disturbing.We can simply never know what was in Oswald's head, including how a non-sniper could expect to not only hit but kill Kennedy, route knowledge or not, with a non-specialized, unsilenced bolt-action rifle in a time window that barely even allowed time for a second ACCURATE shot, let alone a third - given the physical and psychological time needed to re-acquire the moving HUMAN target.We also do not know how he could have possibly expected to escape, having used a non-silenced weapon, multiple floors up in a building located in an area containing so many police and security personnel.Oswald may have believed he was acting alone, but whether he in fact was, we can never really know. To say 'cased closed' is simply too brash in the light of the known and proven CIA/FBI tendencies to chaff the public.The attitude of 'if there is no evidence of a given scenario, it can't have happened' is naive and arrogant in the extreme.I am not saying Posner is necessarily wrong, merely that his determination to write the definitive Kennedy assassination debunking book has blinkered his thinking.

I'll give this four stars out of respect to LL and ROC, who turned in stellar performances. However, like most Xena fans, I was very disappointed with the ending.Not only did Xena cash in her chips in a less than spectacular fashion, the Kiss Of Life sequence was somewhat safely ambiguous. For a series that contained more Sapphic Subtext than you could shake a stick at, the "Gabby's just kissing her to transfer the waters of life" excuse was something of an anti-climax, especially after six seasons. I don't think anybody expected the thespian crush to be fully consummated, but a clearer expression of their obvious mutual attraction would have been more appropriate.This was a powerful double episode and had it not been for Xena's demise, it would have been better received. Certainly one of the finest examples of Lawless and O'Connor's acting prowess. So much so, that it would be criminal not to re-pair the two in a well-written Return episode or movie. Lawless has indicated that she would be open to this very project, so we can but hope.Worth having, even for the sake of completeness, and if there is a Return episiode, series or movie, the traumatic effects of Friend In Need will be greatly lessened. For now, it is the end, and an unsatisfying ending at that. Xena was the greatest female Warrior figure since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, and with the massive cult following that the series has generated, you would think that there simply must be more. Come on Rob, put the old lady back out to work...

A simply breathtaking film about the best and worst that humanity has to offer. While the cast, production and direction cannot be faulted, it is the intelligent way in which the Nazis are depicted that gives Europa Europa its power.Like Swing Kids, Lucie Aubrac and Schindler's List, Europa Europa avoids the "white hats" and "black hats" approach to the characterizations. Yep, a lot of the Hitler Youth were decent kids, however misguided, and yes, some of the German military were just honest soldiers doing a job. It is this humanizing of the German and Russian sides that really draws you into this remarkable young man's (true) story.It is staggering to think that he could evade exposure for so long, given that the Germans, like the British, never circumcized male babies except for medical reasons. Apart from all of the chaos and imminent physical danger, this "will he won't he be discovered" adds an almost unbearable level of tension to what is already a gripping movie.The nonsensical racial purity classes underscore the ideas put forward by Dr. Angela Davis that race and even gender are more of a social construct than a question of biological essence.An astounding tribute to the courage and resourcefulness of a true survivor in a world gone mad.

While I can understand other fans seeing this as her most Kate Bush-like album (not a bad thing) this is still uniquely Sarah, and she simply shines on track after track after brilliant track.Captain Nemo, both versions of The Second Element, the breathtaking By Now (my favorite)... you name it...I actually liked A Salty Dog too, as I was a big Procul fan - she also did a superb job on their A Whiter Shade Of Pale, from La Luna.Dive has a stunning cover shot of a Siren-like Sarah looking simply divine. I love the whole concept of this album, from the cover art to the unforgettable songs.Hmmm, possibly still my favorite, just ahead of Eden, but then all her albums are just that little bit different. It is this ability to meaningfully re-invent herself that makes her so utterly amazing.Absolutely essential.

One of the best compilation albums of all time - but then what can you expect from the best band since Led Zeppelin?Kicking off with the mighty Wasteland, the album covers the full spectrum of The Mission's work, including the breathtaking Butterfly On A Wheel and Deliverance, from Carved In Sand.It is only when you hear track after classic track coming at you that you realize just how strong this band really are. Wayne is a superb lyricist, drawing on everything from Arthurian mythology to important social issues, as in the child abuse song, Amelia.Just scanning the Amazon readers' reviews gives you some sense of the quality of this album. While I may have a slight bias, coming from Leeds in England, the fact that other fans from all over the world are equally blown away, speaks for itself.Utterly beautiful album.

No, this ain't A Midsummer Night's Dream, but the first point to make is that 'the real Dr. Abigail Tyler' is a multi-talented English actress called Charlotte Milchard, so the 'based on real events and real archive footage' is just a psychological twist. I saw through it immediately, as many others did, but the discovery of the illusion has understandably annoyed some viewers.The movie is suspenseful, but the 'create a lot of chaotic noise and visuals while showing nothing' approach has been done to death, and I confess I was very disappointed.Given that this movie was not a genuine re-enactment of actual events, it just seems a pointless addition to the vast number of similar alien/abduction orientated movies that have been coming out for eons. At least the movie Fire In The Sky was based on a real case, and told it well.To me, despite competent production and direction, this was a waste of a very fine cast.

...The trigger phrase for one of the most haunting sub-stories in this work of genius. I haven't read the book in years, but I have just ordered it from Amazon.com.Gabriel Bernstein has got it. It is perfect. Ray Bradbury is a beautiful writer, whose very reverence for LIFE itself is a joy to behold.The sheer quality of the reviews for this masterpiece tells you something about the kind of reaction that the average reader has had. It touched them. It reached them, in a way that few things ever do. Transcendent is certainly the word to describe the experience I had with this and other Bradbury books - the breathtakingly original The Halloween Tree being another must-have.In the section I referred to in the title of this review, a young man meets an elderly lady in an ice cream parlor/store and they are both triggered by the phrase "a dish of lime vanilla ice". The inference is that they are a pair of star-crossed lovers, who either have been a couple in the past (in another life) or will be in the future, in a time when a young boy meets a young girl in a similar setting, and they re-experience this magical, soul-triggering phrase...As a writer myself, I can appreciate the sheer magic that Bradbury shoe-horns into every paragraph. The warmth, the humanity, the feeling of just being glad to be alive in order to savor every sunrise, every cold winter's morn, the sound of the crickets, the smell of the apple blossom, the rumble of an old Ford, the impossible sweetness of that heart-stopping first kiss...I live in a small town myself, and ordering books and CDs is a frustrating task. I cannot thank Amazon enough for being my lifeline to so many modern works of genius, such as this and indeed any other book my this true Modern Master.By the way, Doug Spaulding is a combination of Bradbury's middle name Douglas and his father's surname, Spaulding (his mother was Bradbury).I simply cannot recommend this highly enough.

Well that's how the die-hard, cyborg-like Sea Org people tend to come across, in my experience.If I had thought this book was nothing more than an ill-informed cheap shot at Hubbard, I would not have read it, but it is not. My greatest problems with Scientology were never about the Technology, but with the over-zealousness (to put it very politely) of the Sea Org staff above all, and the absolutely unforgivable price of Services.If you ever complained about the totally unrealistic cost of Services - relative to average earnings, for example, you were met with facile, brainwashed responses about 'what is Freedom worth?' and 'No Clear thinks it's expensive...' all of which totally ignore the fact that the organization is 99% money driven, whether it started that way or not; and that most of The Bridge (the structured path to spiritual freedom) is way beyond the price range of the average individual - unless they become Staff members, of course...While Hubbard is seen to be a questionable character in terms of false claims about a number of issues, including aspects of his military service, as Miller reveals, he may well have developed some important technology at the heart of the Beast that Scientology eventually became.It does not have some of the more immediately threatening aspects of a Cult that many true Cults possess, but it is hard to see it as anything else when you add up the lists of experiences that Miller and others have recorded and analyzed.Don't be fooled by reviewers who hide behind 'attacks on their religion'. If Scientology operated more like a real religion (which it could do), it would not charge so much for its Services. It's pricing structure is simply a control weapon and nothing more.Read the book and make up your own mind.

If the makers of this movie seriously thought that Liz Hurley's off-the-scale sexuality could carry an entire movie, they were right.However, given the quality of the cast, led by the always superb Brendan Fraser, with the gorgeous, classy Frances O'Connor as a perfectly cast love interest, and the masterful direction of Harold Ramis, the movie carries itself.This is an inspired re-make of the amazing original Pete and Dud movie, which featured sixties/seventies goddess (she still is) Racquel Welch. Having a divine creature like Elizabeth Hurley playing the Devil, especially utilizing a fantasy temptress wardrobe to die for, was a stroke of genius. Liz as a schoolmarm, a nurse, a cheerleader... I can't go on...The extra features are excellent from the Commentaries (including Liz H.) to the absolutely invaluable Making Of feature, hosted by La Hurley, which suggests that her considerable sex appeal - a huge part of which is her wicked sense of humor - is just a natural function of who she is, rather than something she has to work at projecting, like Britney Spears.A message to the movie? Yes, pretty much the same as in the original - that happiness cannot come from external trappings. That you have to find your Truth within you, and if you can learn to love yourself, you will automatically be more loveable and more interesting to others, without having to seduce them with money and power. A valid message, which bears endless repetition.You see? I just showed my sensitive, creative, spiritually aware side... and I got through the whole review without mentioning the impossibly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley's billion dollar legs.... Aaaaargh...

Ah... &quot;In Dillman's Grove...&quot; If I could only have one Stevie movie, this would be it, with All Of Me as a very close second.TMWTB comes at you like a runaway train, hitting you with an unrelenting series of ridiculous situations and gags. The first time through I had to actually stop the tape twice because I was laughing so much I was having difficulty breathing.This is classic Martin and a landmark in modern comedy. Only Woody Allen can possibly rival Steve for sheer lunacy. In Two Brains he is also backed by a stellar supporting cast, including a stunning and vampish Kathleen Turner (looking for a new man to torture) and David Warner as Doctor Alfred Necessitor. Yep, pretty well all of the names are utterly ridiculous.Everything from the dysfunctional hotel elevator, which stops four feet short of each floor, forcing Steve to crawl out, to the hooker with the mind-numbingly abrasive voice (Duke duke duke duke of oil, oil, oil...) just keep you reeling and seriously wondering if you will survive to the end.This is nothing less than a work of art and one of the best comedies of any type in the history of the known universe. For people who have never seen it, I truly envy you. You are in for the treat of a lifetime. It still slays me after all these years, but the first time through is just devastating.Ah... the breeze feels good...

To me, this film completely established Spielberg as a truly great director, rather than a merely successful director. Empire is an Art film that succeeds in a fairly linear context. The casting was one of many brilliant components, with a young Christian Bale delivering what was probably the finest performance by a child actor in the history of the film industry. He also proved exceptional a few years later in the Charlton Heston-headed Treasure Island.Spielberg does take license with Jim Ballard's quasi-autobiographical book, but then so did director Sally Potter when she made the utterly stunning film version of Virginia Woolf's Orlando. If the resulting film is a work of Art in its own right, I feel such directorial intervention is usually justified.I was surprised to discover that Empire had not been rated very highly by various critics. This is perhaps the clearest indication that these Industry parasites who do not have the intelligence or the ability or even the courage to create something of their own, cannot recognize true genius even when it is right in front of their piggy eyes.One of the best films of any genre I have ever seen.

A great movie, loosely based on the Nam tour of the real Adrian Cronauer, as others have said.Adrian is a respected member of the Vietnam Vet community and a number of Vet friends have mentioned his take on the movie - 'If I'd done half of that stuff, Id have ended up in Leavenworth'.The movie is both a Robin Williams vehicle and a look at the first major build-up in the War itself. As for it being a 'police action', the irony was not lost on entertainers like Bob Hope, who often greeted his Nam audiences with "Hello Advisors!" even when there were more than 500,000 troops in Vietnam.In many ways this excellent movie was the first real indication of the caliber of Robin Williams as an actor. He simply shines in this role and it led to a well-deserved Oscar nomination and on to greater things.Highly recommended.

A fascinating cult movie. The Elizabethan Magus and astrologer John Dee (shown performing the sign of Osiris Risen on the cover) magically transports Queen Elizabeth I and some of her courtiers forwards in time three hundred years to witness the London of a far far Jubilee.However, the Future London is in the throes of total anarchy, with sex and violence being the order of the day. This is classic Jarman and features a solid cast, which includes Punk goddess Toyah Wilcox, who I believe is now Mrs. Robert Fripp (King Crimson) - who also appeared (gasp... topless) in Jarman's superb version of Shakespeare's The Tempest.This is still well up there in my Top Ten Quirky Movies, along with The Wicker Man, Derek Jarman's The Tempest and Rocky Horror, and is highly recommended.

Easily one of the most beautifully crafted movies I have ever seen.With a cast headed by Pauline Collins and Tom Conti, it's hard to go wrong, but the screenplay and the production and direction all came up to the same high standard, ensuring a masterpiece, which this is.Having seen Tom shine in such intense classics as Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (with an excellent David Bowie), it was delightful to see him seemlessly adapt to the role of Costas, giving the character a warm and a depth that can only come from an actor of his caliber, however good the screenplay.Pauline, who had previously been a high profile British TV and stage actress, is similarly flawless in her title role as Shirley, and the intelligent and uplifting ending was a perfect way to end a perfect movie.It really is as good as you have heard.

As Matty said in Dazed And Confused... Yeah, 5 stars may be a little generous, but if you do have the patience to watch the whole movie unfold, you will be rewarded by some beautifully nuanced interaction between Matthew M. and the divinely sweet Jen Garner.Yep, it's another re-telling of Christmas Carol, but I must say, I really enjoyed it, despite the over the top fatal charm and endless swooning women.I'm guessing the title was borrowed from a phrase by Hugh Grant in Four Weddings And A Funeral, where he literally mentions 'Ghosts of girlfriends past...'Michael Douglas almost stole the show with his role as the rascally Uncle Wayne, although, (no disrespect to Michael) I disagree with including a reference to a memorable night involving himself and Steve McQueen and a bunch of air hostesses (that part was fine) and 'a pile of blow the size of a toaster'... After which Matt's character says, 'It sounded like a great night...' No, drugs can never be part of a great night, and I think it's a mistake to include that part of the scene... sorry...Overall, a great movie, and the way Matthew's character finally comes to his senses is quite touching, due to a powerful performance from MM.

Amanda Bynes is one of the most gifted natural comics in Hollywood, and this hybridized adaptation of Twelfth Night is another excellent vehicle for her talents.Shakespeare himself understood the fun that can arise when gender identification becomes blurred, as in his plays Twelfth Night and As You Like It, above all.Amanda carries off both roles brilliantly, in a performance that cashes in on her stunning grasp of physical comedy.The cross-dressing and accidental same-sex crushes reminded me of the tag line from the superb Helena Bonham Carter/Ben Kingsley version of Twelfth Night... Never send a boy to do a man's job, especially if he's a she...Excellent.

A much-needed guide to Feminine wisdom from a thoroughly modern witch. Clan is one of those rare books that breaks through the Esoterica Barrier and humanizes the practice of working with the Earth Mother and the Life-force itself.It is an especially important book because it creates the impression that Wicca in all its forms makes total sense and that the natural magic Brondwin refers to in her Woman-orientated rituals is the birthright of every female on this planet. For too many centuries women above all, have feared even the idea of spells and incantations because of the legacy of the Inquisition, which Penny Shuttle and Peter Redgrove (The Wise Wound) referred to as &quot;Nine million menstrual murders&quot;.Just reading Brondwin's book, you cannot help but realize that the suppression of the Feminine is nothing less than the suppression of the Life-force itself. After all, we are living in a patriarchal society that changed Menopause from a sacred transition into a form of mental illness. Well, they have to inhibit the Wisewoman somehow, don't they?The irony is that man bashers like Andrea Dworkin and Mary Daly have made it harder for progressive feminists like Barbara G. Walker, June Singer, Jean Shinoda Bolen and C.C. Brondwin to write about Women's Issues. The problem being that over-sensitive males often see Pro-Female as being a form of Anti-Male, which it is NOT.Apart from her erudition, which gives the book its credibility, Brondwin also throws in lashings of sass and humour, and many modern examples to illustrate her points - references to Riverdance and Loreena McKennitt, for example. If you're a guy reading this, buy it for a woman you love, whether it's your wife, girlfriend, mother, sister or whoever. If you're a woman, just buy it.Whether you are looking for spiritual development or Love spells, this book has it all. Brondwin is not an armchair academic pagan. This Wisewoman walks the walk. I can only urge as many women as possible to join her. I have four daughters, and I shall certainly be urging them, too.Steven Cain (author of Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine).

A fascinating book about a remarkable woman. I actually have a hardcover version, which bears a simply stunning Art photo of Marianne taken by Bruce Weber.While the details of her stormy life are genuinely fascinating, so too are the well-chosen photos, including an extremely rare shot of Roy Orbison without his shades - Marianne is wearing them.This excellent autobio by one of the great Women of Rock ranks alongside Somebody To Love? by Grace Slick and I'm With The Band by Pamela des Barres, as a first class piece of Rock Culture entertainment.Apart from the inevitable Jagger-Stones material, which includes many interesting insights, especially about Brian Jones and Keith Richards; she writes frankly about her life and relationships, including her bisexual flings, and about her creative rebirth and the stunning landmark album Broken English.As for the silly Mars Bar folklore, which she demolishes on page 113, the story never made any sense anyway. As a feminist writer put it, it would have been like chewing gum while eating caviar, and the myth was almost a diminishent of Marianne's femininity.A powerful book by a courageous and multi-talented woman who has too often been dismissed as a Stones hanger-on. Check out her new album Before The Poison, and you'll see that she is still very much an artist in her own right.

... for all of the women who served in Vietnam. Read this book, plus the late Lynda Van Devanter's Home Before Morning and you'll see why.While Lynda's book is a hauntingly graphic record of the triumphs and tragedies that the ANC nurses and Army surgeons experienced in Nam, A Piece Of My Heart gives the reader a very broad perspective of the contributions of women in many other areas.The foreword to the book was written by the wonderful Martha Raye, whose unflinching commitment to the men and women who served in Nam led to her being a two-time Purple Heart recipient. That even an entertainer could be wounded twice in the line of duty speaks volumes about the risk level In Country.Equally, Civilian Flight Attendant Micki Voisard almost met her end when her airliner almost collided with a B-52 that was maintaining radio silence during an airstrike.Yet even though the Red Cross Donut Dollies, such as Penni Evans and "Sam" Bokina Christie and WACs such as Doris Allen all have compelling stories to relate, it is the experiences of the nurses that really stay with you, long after you have put the book down.For most of her post-Nam life, former ANC nurse and author Lynda Van Devanter (Home Before Morning - available through Amazon.com) was haunted by the memory of a young soldier who had no face, and who eventually had to be left to die because of the extent of his injuries.When you read the piece by Anne Simon Auger (91st Evac. - Chu Lai) you realize that injuries of that magnitude were not as uncommon as you might hope and pray. Anne also described a young soldier whose face had been shot away, leaving him blind and in her words, "a vegetable".While my own view is that people in such terrible physical condition should be given enough morphine to shut down their breathing, or in the absence of that, on the battlefield, a mercy round from an M-16, I fully accept that however you have to deal with such shocking injuries, it will stay with you for the rest of your life.Let us not forget that while the cowardly Stalinist flag burners were calling the returning troops "baby killers", thousands of true blue American women were risking their own lives to support the largely teenaged US soldiers in a war that increasingly made no sense to the people who were being asked to fight it.These women were Vets. These women were heroes. These women were angels.We must constantly seek ways to honour them. Their sacrifice must never be forgotten.

Moonchildiva has raised an important point. Jack is Jack, just as Matt Monro is Matt Monro. Neither of these great singers were trying to be Frank or Tony.It's human nature to use comparison points, especially where you have such landmark artists as Sinatra, but it is also damaging to upcomers to have that hanging over them the whole time.This is my third double Jack set and yet another classic collection from his golden period. When you look back at his releases from the sixties alone, he was one prolific guy. Not just in terms of the overall number of albums (all classics, too), but in terms of the speed of the recording process.Jack often recorded an entire album of songs in two or three days, which is staggering considering how pampered (and under-talented) most modern artists are. There is just no way to get your head around how good Jack Jones is. He is beyond comparison.There was a long debate in quantum physics over whether Light was a particle or a wave, as it could manifest as both under different circumstances. In the end, people had to conclude that it was neither, and that it was a quantum or sub-atomic entity in its own right.In the same way, we need to accept the uniqueness of Jack Jones, and the fact that he exists independently of the Sinatras and the Bennetts, as the Diva suggested. Besides, any woman who looks like Joanna Cassidy from Blade Runner has to be taken seriously.Another must-buy set at the usual superb Amazon.com price.

Utterly ridiculous. I love it.While The Spy Who Shagged Me is probably a better movie, this is essential, being the one that put Austin on the map... baby. Austin's Unbridalled Sixties Male is just a feast for the eyes and ears in this age of political correctness and wimpy New Age Men.When the unfreezing process affects his 'inner monologue' he finds himself speaking his thoughts aloud as Elizabeth Hurley (as Vanessa) first blows his mind with her stunning physical appearance. &quot;Vanessa's got a fabulous body... I'll bet she shags like a minx...&quot;Great Bond spoofs and a superb cast enable the genius of Mike Myers to shine like never before, in this non-stop laugh extravaganza and unashamed BabeFest. There's even a tip of the hat to classic sixties leather-clad Warrior Women such a Diana Rigg, via Mimi Rodgers' performance as Vanessa's mother, Mrs. Kensington (instead of Mrs. Peel). If I'm not mistaken, the divine Liz Hurley is carrying a 44 Magnum Autoloader - a huge handgun, normally associated with the likes of Clint Eastwood.A joyous romp.

An excellent compilation and a superb introduction to Kate's songs. The only down side is that it only goes as far as The Hounds Of Love album, and therefore does not include anything from The Sensual World, such as her breathtaking classic, This Woman's Work. For what it is, and the time period it covers, it cannot be faulted, and is definitely well worth the money. Enjoy.

There can be no doubt that Sunburst and Futurama are THE two best BBD albums, and to be honest, I keep fluctuating between them as to which is the best. While Futurama is a total guitar overkill album (in a very positive way) Sunburst is a warmer, more lyrical album, which still contains some of Bill's best axework.Easily one of the greatest bands of all time, and Bill was one of the most influential guitarists, likewise. You can hear his influence in everybody from Todd Rundgren (RA, and Bat Out Of Hell above all) to current rockers, The Darkness.If I had to pick a favorite track off Sunburst, it would probably be Crying To The Sky, which contains some of his most beautifully crafted solo work. The solos on tracks such as Heavenly Homes are also right up there with the very best from this man's arsenal, too.If you have this album, I strongly urge you to track down a copy of Futurama, which is technically not available on CD and hasn't been for some time. I actually obtained a copy from an outfit that shipped from Russia, and the album, which also contains additional tracks, as does Sunburst, is absolutely stunning.Bill was one of the most exciting, refreshing and original guitarists I have ever seen (many times - I am from the same part of Northern England as Bill) and I can only hope that as many people as possible will also discover his genius.A breathtaking album from a genuine Guitar God.

My compliments to Erica Anderson for a fine review. This really is a stunning collection of remixes. One And One is my favorite Robert Miles song, and these crisply produced remixes are some of the heaviest dance/trance recordings out there. The combination of the exquisite female vocals and the murderously heavy dance beat is almost hypnotic. Dreamland is indeed the Robert Miles album to get above all - a timeless classic - but this mini album of lengthy remixes is also an essential purchase.

Our Song... as another reviewer rightly said, is a high point on the album, and this is quite possibly the only place to hear it on CD at this time.Jack always delivers, and this is a very strong collection of songs. Opening with one of my personal favorites, A Day In The Life Of A Fool, Jack treats us to some classic covers, including the Bacharach-David masterpiece Wives And Lovers, Lennon and McCartney's Michelle and McKuen/Brel's If You Go Away.Jack has never been afraid of taking chances, and his jazzy treatment of Michel Le Grand's I Will Wait For You, is just one of the delights from this Classic Jack era.Sadly, this does not contain my fave Jack cover And I Love Her, but I could forgive anything of a man who flew out with the USO to share his genius with the troops in Nam.But then, that's Jack.

Being a major Dionne Warwick fan, I find this to be a very well chosen snapshot of the work of the incomparable Bacharach and David.Like Michael, I tended to play down my appreciation of Dionne and the superb songwriting team behind her and so many others, back in the sixties. While I loved Hendrix and Cream and Airplane etc., I also loved the crooners, and the work of Burt Bacharach was a cornerstone of the music of the era.When Mike Myers introduced Burt Bacharach in a semi-surreal romantic moment in Wayne's World, it was a superb tribute from a brilliant actor/comedian to a true music industry icon. It was Mike's way of saying, 'Come on, admit it, the guy's a genius.'No argument here.And I never even realized he'd written the Arthur theme song...

While Trespass was an important album, Nursery Cryme was the first Genesis album on which the band fully realized the magical potential of the sum of the parts.NC is a quantum leap from Trespass and the springboard into the majesty of Foxtrot. I still remember the sheer thrill of being a Genesis fan at this time, this being before they started on the highway to mega stardom. Even the fan club communications came in hand-written envelopes, often stamped with hearts and flowers and words such as 'LOVE'. Alas, I can't remember the names of the original UK fan club women, but they did a superb job.Everything from the haunting Paul Whitehead cover to the lyrically and musically intriguing songs - all of them - make this a landmark album in progressive rock and therefore in the career of the mighty Genesis. Even though they may have technically surpassed NC, it still remains the album for which I have the most affection.Favorite track? Hmmm, either The Musical Box, Seven Stones or The Fountain of Salmacis, but then Hogweed is a unique masterpiece in itself. A classic album with absolutely no dud tracks, and highly recommended.

A dark and disturbing movie, but in many ways, Tom's best work yet. Stone's epic quasi anti-war movie quite rightly shows how the Nam Vets were never honoured for the heroes that they truly were - and that includes the 10,000 Army nurses and Red Cross SRAO women.This movie exposes the Government hypocrisy in many ways, yet perhaps the most powerful commentary is on the state of the Vets hospitals. It's hard to say which scenes are the most harrowing - the ultra-graphic scenes in the Surgical Hospital in Nam, in which the staff had to follow strict Triage protocols and decide who would live and who would have to die (for reasons of resources and time) - or the scenes in the Vet hospital with its almost nineteenth century barbarism.Perhaps the most shameful part of the Government's conduct of the War is that Nixon got elected in 68 on the basis of bringing the boys home, yet he waited until December, 1972 to unleash Linebacker II, the only effective and unrestricted strategic bombing campaign of the entire war.Some years ago I read Robert Bly's Iron John, in which he mentioned that even at that time, more Nam Vets had committed suicide since the end of the War than died during the War itself (more than 58,000). Around the same time, I heard a report that about one third of America's homeless were Vietnam Vets.Watching this movie, you can understand how both of these tragedies have unfolded. I am not a pacifist by any means, but movies like this should be required viewing for people who are considering a career in the military. Not to put them off, but to give them a sense of how badly things can go, so that they may go in with their eyes open.Ron Kovic is a man of tremendous strength and integrity, and he is just one of many many thousands of Vets who were never honoured by their country, and who never heard the words "Welcome home, soldier."There is still time to honour the Vets. We just need to find more ways to do it.

I will never forget the Vet buzz over Doc Pardue's haunting poem, 'Welcome Home My Sisters', written to honor the 10th Anniversary of the Vietnam Women's Memorial. Four female Vet friends emailed me independently and said, "Steve, you HAVE to read this..." Just a few lines in, and I could see why.Kerry Pardue was a field combat medic during the Vietnam War; a war in which US troops sustained as many as 300,000 wounded, many from booby traps. The platoon medics, who went out with every combat patrol, every Search and Destroy, every assault mission, had to be both Medic and combat soldier. The fact that they were respectfully referred to as 'Doc' by their comrades, speaks volumes about their value on the battlefield.Like his Marine Corpsman comrades, Doc Pardue had to make life-and-death decisions in the field, under fire, as the very first cog in the combat medical care machinery. The Docs weren't trained to stem bleeding with one hand while firing an M-16 with the other, they had to figure that out for themselves. And they did.I have had the great honor of knowing Kerry for some time and he and his unforgettable poetry were a constant source of inspiration while I was writing my Nam Vet tribute eBook "How To Appreciate A Vietnam Vet: Dealing With The Myth Of The Unwinnable War" (now on Amazon.com). Doc Pardue graciously permitted me to include some of his stunning war poetry as part of my tribute to the fine men and women who served their Country with honor in Vietnam.The haunting and unique cover art was created by Kerry's combat medic friend, artist Bernie Duff, and it is a perfect choice for this book cover. Doc Pardue is one of the most prolific and influential Vietnam War poets out there, and I simply cannot recommend this collection of poems highly enough.Welcome home, Doc.

I love it. This classic sits on my shelf next to Guin Turner's Preaching To The Perverted, and both are essential fringe/BDSM culture movies.By far the most erotic scenes for me were those where Juliet is making love with the piercing and tattoo laden Ness, played by the divine Canadian-born Debbie Rochon. Debbie's Oscar-worthy orgasm sets an impossibly high standard for the rest of the movie, but it is still a first class piece of Pulp entertainment.The other reviews have nailed it pretty well. Sex and violence, violence and sex. Yet even though the violence is of a Monty Python caricature nature, it pales compared to a lot of realistically portrayed violence as it appears in countless 'mainstream' movies.It's basically a soft pornography movie with Alternate Reality classical pretensions, and goes infinitely beyond the excellent Di Caprio/Danes version of Romeo and Juliet in that regard.Hilarious, crazy, sexy, whaddaya waiting for?

One of the most perfect movies ever made, although with a stunning cast, directed by the masterful John Hughes, it's hard to go wrong.While you could see the divine Kelly Le Brock's character Lisa as a portrayal of the boys' collective Anima, which empowers them in areas in which they were previously inept, e.g. relating to women, she's also rather easy on the eye. This is Babeage off the scale as we know it. Endowed with Einsteinian intelligence, magical powers (L'Isa = Isis) and a bod that just won't quit, Lisa creates scenarios in which the boys can eventually overcome their fears and hangups and become the heroes that they always were.Hughes also takes his trademark shot at the teaching profession (see also Ferris Bueller's Day Off) when one of the Mutant Bikers asks the boys not to blab about his trash-the-house conduct, as it might cost him his teaching job.It's hilarious, it's sexy, it's one long highly imaginative thrill ride that you simply must not miss. The shower scene? Why, I hadn't even noticed...

I think not. Nor, is he in fact, dead. I loved his masterful portrayal of Darcy, as I have loved everything he does, including Love Actually, but it did not prevent me from devouring this gorgeous adaptation.To me, Knightley was a revelation, and this beautifully crafted adaptation is a showcase for her genuine versatility. When you can hold your own against a goddess of stage and screen such as Dame Judi Dench, you've got something going on. Likewise, in her beautiful interaction with a superb Donald Sutherland, when she is speaking to him about Darcy's marriage proposal. Both actors are just stunning.I love this version equally with the Colin Version, and everything from the cinematography to the casting, production and direction all conspire to make this movie a delight for the senses. Being a fan of solo piano, I also loved the soundtrack (Dario Marianelli), especially the exquisite cascading ripples of pieces such as Liz On Top Of The World.At the heart of this delicious interpretation is Austen's disturbing portrayal of the sheer madness of a blinkered patriarchal society in which females, even brilliant, beautiful and gifted females, could never inherit property. Brenda Blethyn's delightful performance as a mother anxious to get her divine daughters married off, is based on this shameful reality.Even though I had heard many good things about the Knightley Version, it actually exceeded my expectations by a quantum factor, and I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.

Every time Sarah puts out a classic album I wonder how the heck she can ever hope to follow it. Yet every time, she does. Stylistically, Afterglow differs only slightly from her previous albums, yet it is distinct and original, and unmistakably Sarah.While this a whole album of great songs, I latched onto certain pieces first time through - Fallen, Stupid, Train Wreck, Push and Time above all. On subsequent listenings, the rest of the songs also came on board.Great songs, great cover and photos. Has she ever looked more beautiful? I sincerely doubt it.In an industry full of posers and gimmick bands, this is yet another breath of fresh air from the queen herself.

This is a wonderful piece of detective work, and whether you agree with some of Chitham's conclusions and speculations or not, it is a joy to follow his reasoning and thought processes.As I am still tweaking my own Emily Bronte novel at this time, this book has provided a great deal of interesting background to the development of The Heights, including its origins, and to Emily's life and her approach to writing.One of Chitham's many useful contributions is his methodical proving of the existence of a second Emily Bronte novel. While I do not concur with his assessment of the probable content of that novel, I very much enjoyed reading this and all of his ideas.His obvious respect for the work of other great Bronte scholars, such as Stevie Davies (Emily Bronte: Heretic, Four Dreamers And Emily) only reinforces his own open-mindedness and broad-based, meticulous research.Excellent.

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree..." (Samuel Taylor Coleridge) With a title concept that leans on Coleridge's poem Kubla Khan, and a Ray Bradbury Sci Fi story or two, and a cover that evokes Their Satanic Majesties Request by the Stones, this was one powerful debut album.The title track alone, which features the mighty Steve Howe on guitar (the album was brilliantly produced by his Yes bandmate Trevor Horn) is a work of art, and being supported by many other stunning songs, including the timeless Relax, Two Tribes and The Power Of Love, the album represents ridiculous value.Sadly, this 'shooting star' reached the top almost too quickly and never followed through with anything comparable. Still, they left us with a true masterpiece, for which we should be grateful.

A true work of genius. Even by Allen's own standards, this movie is a classic. So few films have Maximum Initial Impact, in that they fail to deliver maximum enjoyment on one's first viewing.While Annie Hall certainly bears considerable repeated viewing, it is simply stunning first time through. Apart from the brilliant dialogue and character depth, it contains so many all-too-human touches. I loved the part on the first date when he asks Annie if he can kiss her before they start, just to take away the tension of will-they won't-they kiss, so that they may more easily relax and enjoy their first time out.As a fairly linear romantic comedy, it is unsurpassed, yet there are also many surrealistic elements which give it a quality that one usually associates with European movies.Woody Allen shoehorned so many brilliant and original ideas into Annie Hall that it is staggering to recall that they were all from the same movie. Everything from the Jew-hating grandmother to the kids in his class telling the camera what they ended up as in adult life, serve to keep you off balance, so that you never slide into a "well I can see what's coming up next" state of complacency.Allen is a master when it comes to relationships and human failings (and strengths) and his hilarious handling of sexual interactions - "I'm just trying to work some circulation back into my jaw" - makes this one of those rare movies in which virtually everybody can find something to make you squirm and say, "Oh man, he's right".Annie Hall is classy, it's beautiful, it is full of love, wisdom and compassion, and above all it is utterly hilarious. A breathtaking work of genius (repetition on "genius", there) from a man who has no equal in the film industry.

Next time somebody claims to hate Barry Manilow, see if they'll take a polygraph test to that effect (see my review of Ultimate Manilow). If they refuse, strap 'em into a chair and make them listen to this album.I confess I only came to this overlooked (by some of us) 1984 work of genius after hearing When October Goes on Ultimate Manilow. The man is a class act and this is easily one of his best albums ever. I know some of you guys reckon it's THE best, and I'm not sure I'd argue with you.Certainly a side of the Man that will confound his sternest critics. A beautiful mature, jazzy album to play when you are snuggled up on the couch with that special person. Unfortunately mine is down there in Arizona, dang it.Wonderful.

Please ignore the hostile reviews for this book. They appear to have been written by Ramsey supporters, and are therefore hopelessly biased.The book is excellent, and one of the most pertinent truths relates to the way the Ramseys dehumanized their 'lady mannequin', and in hypersexualizing their tiny six-year-old princess, they not only put her on show for every pedophile to lust over, they also gave her a distorted sense of body image - one of Davis's critical points.With regard to the propaganda about 'the real killer', the reviewers appear to be talking about John Mark Karr, who was cleared of involvement in the JonBenet killing. The guy was a nut job.The other gross inaccuracy is the claim that 'the evidence' supports the Intruder theory, thus clearing the Ramseys.No, there has never ever been ANY clear evidence of an intruder. The only 'clues' that might have been factors were debunked years ago. It was effectively impossible for a killer who had such close and prolonged contact with the child, to not leave ANY certain DNA traces.There was no intruder.

In spite of a tendency to taper off towards the end, this is a very well crafted movie and one that is so rich in teen movie back references that you could watch it a dozen times and still get something new from it on each pass.This is an immensely talented young cast, bolstered by major talents such as Randy Quaid, as the alcoholic Nam Vet Dad, Ed Lauter as the Coach ... and a stunning-as-always Jaime Pressly as the Head Cheerleader.Wolf Lake's Mia Kirshner almost steals the show as The Popular Jock Jake Wyler's vampish sister, who spends most of the movie trying to seduce him, Cruel Intentions-style.While there are many nineties onwards teen movie references, this is a feast for John Hughes fans. This Hughes Homage also includes a few classic cameos, from Paul Gleason (the Teacher From Hell in The Breakfast Club), Lyman Ward (Ferris Bueller's Dad) and Molly Ringwald as a Flight Attendant in the airport.No, this ain't Out Of Africa, but even the deliberately vulgar humor actually manages to be funny, and on a Laughs Per Minute basis, this BabeFest is easily one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen.A classic. I just hope they make a sequel.

While Catch The Moon is somewhat more linear than I was expecting given the cosmic title, it succeeds as a well-told story of both spiritual and sexual awakening in one's formative teenage years.While I prefer Sue's fascinating Sci Fi/Fantasy Siren Song, this book, seen in perspective, was a very creditable first (published) novel.At a modest 105 pages and less than 30 lines per page, the book is very confrontable for those who may not be big on reading or who are only just beginning to explore the world of the novel.Catch The Moon deals intelligently with some very adult themes - loss, grief, jealousy, betrayal, love and relationships - and while I had guessed the final twist ahead of time, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story.The haunting title refers to the time when Rina, the main character and narrator, thought she could catch the moon's reflection in her hands and hold it while she made a wish, yet once the water rippled, the moon seemingly shattered into a thousand pieces, as if someone had shattered a dream.In like fashion, her dreams are shattered during the course of the story...

While I have no problem in accepting the possibility that the provably controlling Arthur Bell Nicholls was capable of murder, the idea that Charlotte would have in any way condoned it is simply ridiculous.That is where this book and the late James Tully's driving theory falls down.We know without a doubt that Nicholls decimated Charlotte's privacy to the extent that he monitored her letters to her dearest friend Ellen Nussey, and that he destroyed all of the literally hundreds of letters from Ellen to Charlotte, along with other writings, including journals etc. after her death. He even told Charlotte that Ellen must destroy all of the letters that Charlotte had sent to her. Thankfully, Ellen never did.Whether he was jealous of the long-term romantic friendship that Charlotte and Ellen had always enjoyed, or whether darker motives stirred him, the man behaved abominably.As with so many Bronte-related novels, Tully employs the tiresome mechanism of diary/journal entries, as did Emma Tennant in Heathcliff's Tale and Jill Jones did in Emily's Secret. While I am not hostile to either of those books, I much prefer Maureen Peters' technique of using real-time (as it was in Charlotte's actual life) dialogue as in her Charlotte Bronte novel Child of Fire, in which she also rightly paints Nicholls as a callous and evil opportunist, if not a murderer.Tully may have it half right, in identifying Nicholls as a monster, but his suggestions that Charlotte was in any way responsible for the other deaths in her family, which has created so much understandable flak, simply don't make sense.As Elaine Miller proved in her stunning, well-supported essay, Through All Changes and Through All Chances, (which includes many conclusive letter segments) the love of Charlotte's life was Ellen Nussey, not her manipulative husband of nine months, who got her to change her will in favor of him while she was essentially on her death bed.In Ellen's own words... "She told me things she never told anyone else. I have hundreds of her letters and I had her heart."

Ditto to Dennis Littrell's eloquent and well-informed review, by the way. This is a solid and varied sequel indeed, and the Doc looks very cool on the cover, but I just want to focus on the Ramsey case above all.While the excellent Dr. Lee does not flat out accuse the Ramseys of involuntary manslaughter and a pitiful cover-up, his use of probability terminology speaks for itself.To clarify things, the critical points to grasp about the Ramsey case include the following...There is no conclusive evidence - of any kind - that there was ever an intruder. All of the 'possible clues' touted by pro-Ramsey people have long ago been debunked.The tainted, partial DNA sample that has been referred to repeatedly, could have come from any number of sources, including the clothing manufacturer/packer, and there is absolutely no evidence whatosever that it came from an intruder.The sample is a limited 10-loci/marker sample and could never be enough to convict in isolation (you need 13 loci or sequencing markers), even if an idiot like John Mark Karr had been telling the truth. It is of some limited use in eliminating suspects, i.e. if any of their 10 corresponding markers don't align with the sample, they can be excluded.The DNA is a red herring, anyway, especially as used by the Ramseys' belligerent lawyer Lin Wood. For him to drone on that the Ramseys were cleared by comparison to the case DNA is utterly meaningless on two counts. Firstly, because there is NO evidence that the DNA was that of a killer/intruder; secondly, because, as with any parent/child relationship, the Ramseys' DNA could have quite legitimately been all over JonBenet. Nothing short of finding John's semen in her mouth, vagina or anus could have been considered truly compromising.As Dr. Lee suggests, given the total lack of evidence to support the intruder theory, the likelihood is that JonBenet was killed by accident and the parents panicked and created a woefully illogical and transparent cover-up.No intruder could have had such prolonged and close physical contact with the child and not left siginicant DNA behind. To do that, he would have to have been wearing a space suit.To me, the good doctor has put the final nail in the Ramsey's well-nailed coffin.

Given that so many of Richard and Karen's songs were love songs, this is virtually a Greatest Hits album in its own right.One of the main reasons for buying Love Songs in addition to the superb Singles 1969-1981 album is the inclusion of classics such as A Song For You, which remains one of their most beautiful and inventive songs, yet which was left off the Singles album.There's nothing I could say that hasn't been already said by other fans, and better than I could say it, so I will just rave about the strength of the song selection and sheer quality of the album package.A stunning album, and another bitter-sweet reminder of just how much we all lost with Karen's untimely passing.

The Ramseys' legendary arrogance comes across all too clearly in this rambling, self-serving piece of utter denial.To me, latching onto God and trying to rally support from Conservative Christians was just one of a number of theatrical cheap shots, designed to muddy the waters in this sorry case.The nonsensical 'evidence' of an Intruder has by now all been fully debunked - not that it amounted to proof in the first place.There is absolutely no firm evidence of an intruder; no clear signs of entry/exit; the only DNA sample is not only tainted and partial, there is no evidence whatsoever that it came from an intruder anyway; no intruder who had such extended and close contact with the girl could possibly have avoided leaving clear DNA evidence in his wake... There was none.Clearly, despite the best efforts of the seriously deluded Lou Smit and others, the Intruder theory is provably untenable.There was no intruder.Given that the Intruder Theory was a either a gross misinterpretation or a complete fabrication, we by definition, are left with one group of suspects - the Ramseys.This is not quantum theory, folks. If nobody else could possibly have been there and pulled it off (they couldn't), it must have been the Ramseys, like it or not.One of the best examples of how their lawyer Lin Wood has tried to side-step their guilt is his slow, repetition of 'facts' such as the Ramseys were cleared by comparisons with the 'case DNA'.No, the tainted, partial DNA held by the DA etc. could have come from a number of sources, and there is absolutely no reason to assume that it came from an intruder. No reason. To say that the Ramseys were cleared by DNA analysis is therefore utterly meaningless. The 10-loci 'case DNA' is not even a full spectrum 13-loci sample, and even if it were thought to be from an intruder, it wouldn't be enough to convict on DNA evidence alone.Simplistic nonsense.

...is that M Night's brilliance does not lie in his ability to trick or surprise the viewer, it is his ability to entertain the viewer.To be honest, I've never found his plot twists to be especially clever or unpredictable, but I have always loved his movies because of the way he involves the viewer from the first scene onwards.Even with Signs, which was at best only an average sci fi movie, M Night still succeeded in wowing his audience due to the metaphorical layering that is present in all of his movies, including The Village.Yep, much of the hidden truth of The Village can be guessed ahead of time, but that does not stop it being an intensely involving movie.This is another superb and well-cast movie from a great director, who is too often being judged by the wrong criteria.

This is a very well made and very informative DVD. While it didn't teach me anything new, that is only because I have read a great deal about the Brontes. So much so, that I can tell how much useful information this contains.The scenery is wonderful, and the content and pacing is good, as is Liam's narration. The only complaint I have is that there is no guided tour of the Parsonage, the Bronte family home. This would have been the icing on the cake.For the record, the Parsonage has been preserved in its 1850's layout, after Charlotte, the longest surviving sister, and her husband, Arthur Bell Nicholls, had carried out certain alterations, such as expanding Charlotte's room at the expense of narrowing what had been Emily's room, and widening the dining room at the expense of narrowing the entrance hallway.I visited Haworth twice during my time in the UK, and this DVD gives you a good quick guide to the area. For any future documentaries, I would only request that they include a guided tour of the Parsonage and the much-haunted Black Bull pub, which Branwell used to frequent.Well worth the money.

Given my tendency to ramble during reviews, I'll slip into my minimalist mode...Arthur and Village Green are not only the two greatest Kinks albums, they are also two of the greatest Rock albums in the history of the known universe. While Ray Davies went on to write many classic songs, including the exquisite Lola, these two albums probably represent his creative peak. There was simply nobody to touch Ray at this time. He just ruled.Next time they send out a deep space probe containing Earth artifacts, they should include these two albums, as a small sample of the work of one of the greatest musical geniuses this planet has ever produced.It's a pity that his genius has only ever been fully appreciated by the legions of Kinks fans. Still, as the man said, it's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world.So much for minimalism...

As legend would have it, this was the album that Bill recorded in fellow band member Richard Brown's bedroom. Dang, you can even hear a toilet flushing in the background.While the album is ten thousand light years from the techno wizardry of Roy Thomas Baker, who produced Futurama, it remains a true classic for any serious fan of the Man. The songs are indeed more inclined towards folk, but you can certainly hear Bill's guitar style developing, and his soloing is most impressive.I still have the vinyl and the Teenage Archangel/Jets At Dawn single that came along later, also on Smile, but the CD is infinitely more convenient, and highly recommended. Go for it.

Bravo, to all the fine men and women, gay and straight, who have stood up for this beautiful movie.While there have been many excellent movies about relationships between men, they have often been semi-obscure art movies. With Brokeback Mountain, we are seeing the same level of intelligence and sensitivity in a mainstream movie. The fact that the two main characters are cowboys, a traditionally masculine image, makes this all the more powerful. Yes, you can be gay and macho at the same time.This is a long overdue, stereotype-breaking movie. While this was initially set in the early sixties, we still live in a society in which there are definite limits to 'acceptable conduct', based on gender. Even today, if two men greeted each other with a kiss in a supermarket setting, the way women often do, they would be seen as nancy boys. Traditionally, men are only allowed to be affectionate with each other on the sports field or on the battlefield.Full marks to the writer, the cast, and Ang Lee above all for their courage and vision.

A very erudite and compassionate work. Having grown up in Europe as a non-Jew, I was stunned to discover the extent of routine circumcision among non-Jews in North America, especially the USA.The classic movie Europa Europa exemplifies the degree to which European attitudes differ from those in the US. In EE, a young Jewish guy inadvertently ends up in a WWII Hitler Youth group and therefore has to hide the fact of his circumcision to the nth degree - simply because in Europe (even now) only Jewish boys are routinely circumcized.The main modern argument in favour of circumcision is that there is a lesser chance of one's female partner developing cervical cancer etc. if the foreskin has been removed. Yet, as a man who has been married for more than 20 years, it is quite clear to me that provided proper cleanliness is maintained, the woman is at no more risk than she would be from having intercourse with a circumcized male.This book is absolutely essential reading. The bottom line, is that unless there are deeply felt religious considerations in your family, FORGET IT! You only need to surf the Men's Movenment groups to see how outraged thousands of men feel about their unthinking abuse at the hands of their unthinking parents and a soulless system that just runs on automatic.Quite brilliant.

This is a real film about real people - and the original Aubracs were literally real people.Ditto to everything Paul said. I would just like to add a few details in the hope of increasing people's awareness of what this French warrior goddess actually achieved. (I honoured Lucie with a significant mention in my first book.)The film is wonderful, but in some ways it is a simplified version of the actual events - especially the ending.Lucie Aubrac was five months pregnant when she planned and led a successful raid on the Nazi convoy that was taking her husband to his place of execution.After the rescue, the Aubracs were hidden by loyal comrades for three months until an RAF covert operations aircraft could be sent to retrieve them.On the night of their escape, the plane, which I believe was a Lockheed Hudson, became stuck in the mud of the landing field, with dawn and the Nazi patrols only a few hours away.FIFTY local villagers risked their own lives to come to the aid of their beloved Resistance friends and soon the plane was pushed free.Lucie's daughter was born only a few days after their safe arrival at a British airbase. Her courage and leadership drew praise from battle-hardened Resistance soldiers and RAF aircrews of the elite Moon Squadron.This film is about true French spirit. About a people who would never surrender, never stop fighting, who helped countless Allied airmen escape back to England, and who eventually liberated Paris even without Allied help. That my friends, is what the real French are like.A magnificent film.

Yep, one of the best James Bonds ever has a major role as one of the Possible Dads in this musical masterpiece - and he does a great job on the songs, folks.The inspired casting is just one of the things that makes this such a delightful experience, and I highly recommend the 2-disc DVD, for the invaluable insights into the production, cast interviews etc.One of the most unbelievable technical achievements is the fact that most of the Greek village is actually a set, inside and out.With a cast that includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters and Colin Firth, the quality is a sure thing, and the screen adaptation by the trinity of women behind original breathtaking stage show is exceptional.Loved it.

...and follow Army Nurse Sharon Grant Wildwind on an unforgettable tour of the 71st and 67th Evac. Hospitals in the Vietnam of 1970-71.Like so many of her fellow Vets, male and female, Sharon was a prolific photographer In Country, and this stunning book is peppered with all manner of candid shots which actually put you right there among the triumphs and tragedies that were daily life in a busy Evacuation Hospital. As if there was some other kind.As with Byron 'Doc' Holley's &quot;Vietnam 1968-69: A Battalion Surgeon's Journal&quot; (available through Amazon.com) - David Hackworth's Doc, Sharon G W has written her haunting record in the form of a journal. Her day by day account of a Nam Nurse's life, of long hours, and ever-present but unknown risks, is compelling reading.The striking title comes from SGW's poem about dealing with the Vietnam Experience. Something which a huge number of Vets are still dealing with every day. Like her courageous sisters before her, Frances Slanger (KIA 1944) and Sharon Ann Lane (KIA Vietnam, 1969), Sharon Grant Wildwind risked her own young life to help save thousands of young soldiers in the face of extreme danger and harsh conditions.The daily Nam life is broken up periodically by reflections marked &quot;Calgary, Alberta&quot;, where Sharon was living while she put the book together. They give you additonal insights and a level of perspective that creates an almost transcendent feel to the overall book. Towards the end, there is even a copy of SGW's Bronze Star citation, as well as a wonderful picture of her receiving it.While she expresses some skepticism about the value of the medal, she knows that her time in Vietnam is something to be proud of. No argument here.If you can read this graphic record of the triumph of the human spirit with dry eyes, you've got a problem.Highly recommended.

This is a truly delightful film, with a cast that just takes synergy to another level.Being an Austen fan, it is a pleasure to watch such a beautifully crafted tribute, which itself is based on a superb novel.The film takes us through all six of her novels (Persuasion and the Gothic parody Northanger Abbey were initially published as a set, after her untimely death) in a Life imitating Art/Art imitating Life series of character/relationship parallels.That such a fine movie would be made at this time is a tribute to the longevity of a writer who had chosen to publish anonymously in her lifetime, and whose work only slowly began to be appreciated during the nineteenth century, before it exploded in popularity in the twentieth.While her critics included the mighty Charlotte Bronte, there is no doubt that, as the film suggests, Pride and Prejudice is a classic piece of romantic fiction, which stands in its own right.The Special Features are wonderful, and take you behind the scenes, even to the level of deconstructing the Book Club, the casting choices, the hybridization of 'Emma' in present time, cast interviews, you name it.Superb value.

While Pat may ruffle a few feathers here, he is certainly drawing attention to many areas that have been glossed over by those who would have us keep our heads in the sand.I know what it is like trying to get a job as a middle-aged white male in North America - virtually the only social group not to receive any assistance or special funding. Having had that experience, I am not about to believe any of the Communist propaganda that is designed to make us feel guilty for recognizing the truth in all this chaos.While I respect Pat's views, I'm not sure the Pill itself has been the problem, more that the birth rate amongst Asians in particular has been so out of control. Contrasted with a static or slightly declining White European population, this is set to cause a dramatic social imbalance.Ironically, it is the very state of the world that puts many young couples off the idea of having children. Stronger, more coherent leadership might encourage some of these people to go ahead and start families, but that is yet to manifest.One of the reasons that the Left have had some successes in discrediting serious analysts such as Pat B is that Joe McCarthy went over the top in his earlier Communist bashing. Not that he was wrong to bash Communist traitors, but that in his clumsy fashion, he also targeted patriotic gays and Jews, who were in no way a threat to the United States.Extrapolating from Pat's ideas, it seems quite likely that uncontrolled immigration from non-white, non-English-speaking countries has been a calculated act of subversion by the Communists who have been trying to undermine the Western power base for decades.We do not have integrated, cosmopolitan societies. We have racial and political chaos. Anybody who tries to convince you otherwise is selling you a lie. There is clearly nothing wrong with immigration per se. It only becomes a problem when there is no attempt to integrate the incoming groups or monitor their numbers, and avoid the creation of social enclaves or ghettos.Perhaps the final folly is the latest move to ban the Confederate flag, under the guise of it being a "racist" symbol. Yet far from removing it, they will simply make it a rallying image for every WASP who has had enough of being pushed into the background and being blamed for all the evils of the world. It will forge alliances between groups of Whites who would not normally link up. I say "folly", because the idea of it being a racist symbol could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Like Pat, I am not a racist, just a realist. If a man was prepared to crawl through a minefield under heavy fire and bang a morphine needle into my chest, I couldn't give a dang whether he was black, gay or whatever.Immigration is completely out of control and has been for decades. Whether apparency or reality, there is a widespread belief that alien groups are coming to North America and dictating to the white European and African-American populations who built the countries, what they will and will not accept and what laws they will and will not obey. All people should have equal rights. Nobody should be "more equal" than anybody else. You wouldn't expect to be able to open a liquor store in Saudi Arabia. The entire situation doesn't make sense, and at least Pat has the guts to stand up and say something.

I once described The Ron as The Last Great Republican, hoping that I was going to be proven wrong... Not so far...As other reviewers have commented, it isn't just Bush's sketchy economics and questionable foreigh policy decisions that have alienated so many traditional Conservatives; it is the sad, sad contrast with the purity of Reagan and Thatcher's ideological war against the evil empire of Communism.The ideologically barren Bush/Cheney administration simply does not inspire confidence in any quarter, and I agree, one of the most alarming factors is Bush's failure to be grooming a future Republican president.Cheney will never be seen as a potential candidate. It's bad enough that a five-time draft dodger is part of the machine that is sending troops out to Iraq. Still, that and his heart problems aside, he is about as charismatic as Tom Waits on downers.The book can be a little dry, but since it leans towards an analysis of Dubya's economic rather than purely political performances, it necessarily covers the relevant territory.To me, Bush has been a PR disaster, too. I know Conspiracy Theory tends to lurk whatever adminstration is in power, but under Bush, the CT lobby have had a field day.One of the reasons the 9/11 'conspiracy' took such hold is the sheer level of incompetence and above-the-Law arrogance of the security services and Bush's spin doctors.Their failure to clearly explain the scattered multi-site wreckage from Flight 93 and the initially confusing inappropriate damage to the Pentagon, led people, not unreasonably, to suspect a cover-up, especially given the too-symmetrical, rapid 'pancaking' during the collapse of the Twin Towers.Yes, there may be legitimate explanations for everything, but having mis-identified half of the hijackers, how much confidence can people retain?After the scandalous way the JFK assassination was handled, Bush had the chance to set things right, by carrying the American people with him, not just by invoking knee-jerk patriotism, but by winning the trust of the people, ironically by proving that the security services would not repeat the 'seize everything, tell nothing' approach of their JFK-era counterparts.They blew it.If the above seems like a tangent, I would ask you to consider that a president who does not inspire trust, is no president at all. So, where do we go from here?

Being a fan of the Mitchell bomber, Harrison, Leslie and Chris Plummer, I have to give it five stars.It's also worth it for the somebody-marry-this-woman scene in which the young Resistance woman shoots one of the Nazi troopers who is trying to capture Ford and Plummer. Gotta love the Resistance.On the whole, the other reviewers have pretty well nailed it. Not the greatest war movie ever made and weak in many areas, but it still manages to retain a charm of its own, and the scenes in wartime London in which the streets are full of men and women uniform, are very well put together.It was a remarkable time, however dangerous and tragic, and watching the chemistry between Ford and Down, you can understand how the US troops who had been stationed in England took home 100,000 war brides.Sweet movie, and well worth the price.

Don't you know now... Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead-on insight into the world of a touring Rock band and the role of the journalistic 'Enemy'.Cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton. There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg. Peter was the Pie's lead guitarist, along with the sadly late Stevie Marriott.Not only is this a flawless piece of casting, including the always excellent Frances McDormand as Pat's Mom, but the band are totally believable, even though Billy Crudup and the brilliant Jason Lee weren't even musicians at the outset. You don't get a piece of this quality without a great deal of hard work, research, and attention to detail, and between Peter Frampton and Cameron himself, they have ensured that the finished product is a work of Art.The Bootleg Cut is absurd value, featuring the extended version of the movie, plus the original and an excellent 6 track CD, which includes the Wilson-Crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes.Stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine. Jason's Paul Rogers of Bad Company look is perfect, and his lip-synching is flawless. Likewise Billy's guitar playing.Kate Hudson absolutely shines, as does newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays 'Cameron'. Naturally, to quote Jason, "the chicks are good", as you might expect with a collection of stunning and talented actresses that includes Kate, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Olivia Rosewood and Bijou Phillips. Yes, it's a BabeFest.Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, with a simply stunning soundtrack. Aaaaaah The Rain Song...Take me now, Fairuza...

I take David Eberhart's point about the depressing quality that weaves its way though this movie - the front end, during his early years, being the most depressing by far.The almost Shakespearean tragedy of mis-placed affection and obsessive love that led Andersen to pursue the wrong woman is captured well, while various fairytales are woven into the real-life a story span.Bew is almost over the top as a wacky but gifted Andersen, although his craziness gradually diminishes as the movie progresses.Emily Hamilton gives a heartbreakingly sweet and sensitive performance as his 'adoptive' sister, whom any man in his right mind would have married in an instant.By the time Andersen works out that he really loved Emily's character after all, it is too late...When it works, it works beautifully, and the cast, which includes the superb James Fox and Alison Steadman (who turns in a couple of delicious cameos) all delivered admirable performances.Not perfect, but worth a look.

A powerful, unforgettable movie that works on many levels.While it is set against the background of the tragic history of a divided Ireland, the movie also explores many aspects of human sexual attraction, and the destructive nature of role playing in relationships, whatever orientation is the focus.As with the Christmas Truce of 1914, The Crying Game makes the point that in any war, there are good men and women on both sides; people who have no quarrel with each other, yet who have to sometimes take each other's lives.The cast all deliver excellent performances, especially Stephen, Forest and Jaye, and the movie is well executed at every level.Like The Wicker Man, this is somewhere between an upper bracket mainstream movie and an Art House movie, and the version of the title song by Boy George is just superb.

I wholeheartedly agree with the many reviewers who rightly suggested that Imelda Staunton should have received an Oscar for this simply stunning performance. The other striking performance came from Helen Coker, who played WPC Best, the Woman Police Constable who was so intelligently sympathetic and respectful to Vera, as were some of the male officers.This haunting movie, set in 1950s England, is chillingly relevant even today, as Bush's self-righteous Bible thumpers are poised to overturn Roe Vs Wade and plunge American women back into the Dark Ages. If that, what will be next? Inquisition 2, and another 9 million 'menstrual murders' (The Wise Wound)?These are strong words, I know. They need to be. As hinted at in Vera Drake, the wealthy American Conservatives know that they can always send their pregnant daughters up to Canada for legal abortions, while poor women will be left with unthinkable options of the kind employed by Vera Drake.Abortion should never be treated lightly. It is a haunting, life-changing decision for the vast majority of women who find themselves in the position of having an unwanted pregnancy; and the handful of women who repeatedly use abortion as a form of birth control should be sterilized on principle.An unforgettable movie. Let's hope we never see the likes of those days again. If we do, the troops currently out in Iraq might be needed on the streets of the US.

If I could only have one Joni Mitchell album (a terrible dilemma), this would be it. While there may be more cohesive and mature albums in her collection, Ladies perhaps came closest to capturing the very essence of Joni's musical and lyrical magic.Ladies Of The Canyon is an album of bright summer mornings and rainy afternoons, throughout which Joni's voice and piano are at their purest and most exquisite. Morning Morgantown, Conversation and Ladies Of The Canyon itself have a freshness and a mystique that an incredible 32 years have failed to diminish in any way.The tour de force of the album is still Circle Game, which is a bitter-sweet song about individual life unfoldment, reincarnation and the eternal cycles of the Universe.While Blue, For The Roses, Court, Lawns, you name it, are all truly brilliant albums, I feel that only her classic 'live' album Miles Of Aisles comes close to equalling the sheer magic of Ladies Of The Canyon.Whatever it is that makes Joni Mitchell the divine enchantress she has always been is fully captured here on Ladies Of The Canyon and on Miles Of Aisles.An outstanding album that will never fade.

I'm a cheap date when it comes to Jarman. For me, the man could do no wrong. Yet personal bias aside, this is truly a classic and inspired interpretation of the Bard's last and most haunting work.'Canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell?', asks the banished enchanter Prospero of his daughter Miranda. The cell being the key. The Tempest takes place in a Moorcockian artificially-sustained reality, such as in Michael's Dancers At The End Of Time and The New World's Fair.It is this essential element that Jarman captures so brilliantly, adding to the unreality by a number of techniques, such as the use of coloured filters and by placing his anarchic, wacked-out cast in a Gothic setting.The Island - the cell - is our individual sense of identity and reality, and in a fascinating interpretation which brushes the cheek of Zen and the Baghavad Gita, Jarman reveals that there is no mutant enemy, except ourselves.

With apologies to Sting...The main problem in comparing this to Nabokov's original is that Dolores in the book is 12 going on 13, and Dominique Swain comes across as 15 going on 35. Swain is a fine actress and she plays her part well, but something akin to Natalie Portman's performance and appearance in the Lolita-esque "Leon - aka The Professional" would have been much closer to the mark.Irons does his usual impeccable job in the telling of this almost tragi-comic tale of the futility of obsession and of basic human alienation, and Irons and Swain do succeed in carrying things off.Few movies tend to follow the book slavishly, and when the movie works brilliantly, as with Sally Potter's 'Orlando' or Spielberg's 'Empire Of The Sun', the Directorial license can be easily justified. Lyne's Lolita did not work as well as the other two adaptations, but it remains a fine movie, and is certainly not significantly inferior to the Kubrick version.

If anybody ever looks blank when you mention Matt's name, just point out that he immortalized the Theme Song for From Russia With Love. If they don't recognize the man's brilliance immediately as in &quot;Oh him... amazing voice&quot; they are either too young or have no musical taste whatsoever.This is a classic selection of Matt's work and absolutely ridiculous value at the price Amazon.com are offering. Pick any song at random and you will realize that this man was literally second to nobody in this world. Like Jack Jones (another of my fave singers) Matt was his own man and never walked in anybody's shadow.Who knows, maybe if he'd been born on our side of the Atlantic, he could have soared even higher, but as other fans have said, it is actually very gratifying to know that we always knew him for the genius that he truly was.

Priest... back with Rob? I'll take it.This is an absolute classic, and as always, the Japanese rock audiences prove to be among the best in the world. This reunion has been a long time coming, but it was well worth the wait.The band are as tight as ever, the sound and futuristic lighting are fantastic, and Rob is his own Terminator self. No disrespect to Mr. Owens, who did a great job, but this is the real McCoy.Excellent track selection, great visuals, but no extras, alas, which is disappointing after 30 years of Priest classics. I saw them six times when I still lived in the UK, and they are as hot as ever.Essential for any Priest fan.

I was really rooting for George and Co. in anticipation of this long-awaited prequel, but like many Star Wars fans I found the dreadfully-titled Phantom Menace to be little more than a sophisticated children's movie. This problem is partly due to the age of the protagonist, although not enough effort was made to maintain the adult interest factor.The original Star Wars trilogy was intelligently written, brilliantly cast, produced and directed, and hardcore enough to appeal to anybody of any age. Yet in spite of a good cast, which includes such giants as Sam Jackson and Liam Neeson, Phantom Menace (what a ghastly Fifties pulp title) cannot hold a candle to the original movies.This quality DVD is worth having for the sake of completeness, especially in view of the fact that Episode 2, the almost as weakly titled Attack Of The Clones, appears to be far more like the original Star Wars. More combat, more edge and more maturity.I wish I could be more postive about this, but there was more Menace in the Mel Brooks spoof.

The system is excellent, and the author offers you many combinations to max out the chances of multiple wins for the numbers that you successfully pick... Now there's rub, as Shakespeare said... However brilliant the strategies may be for maxing out the wins for a given number selection (6 for the Lotto 6/49 etc.) you are still left with the problem of picking the RIGHT six numbers.If you use his System 20 and pick 10 numbers, it will max out the wins for any of the 'drawn' numbers from your chosen ten; but as even ten numbers out of 49 still leaves 39 that you didn't choose, the odds on winning are still slim.This is not a criticism of the book whatsoever, I just want potential buyers to understand that this is a way of maxing out any wins that you do get, if you successfully pick e.g. three or more 'drawn' numbers. Instead of winning e.g. $80, you could win $80 three or four times over in the same ticket batch.Good luck...

The material covered in this tape is essentially the basis for Robert's classic, Iron John, but here, his ideas are fully rounded and expanded in context - partly due to the excellent interactions with Bill Moyers.I have never seen Robert be so clear, coherent and powerful as in these insightful exchanges. He is the living embodiment of the male mentor, the older wise male who can help the younger men through various developmental transitions that are usually so problematic in a society in which there are no true male initiatiion rituals.I would strongly recommend watching this video before reading Iron John.Outstanding.

Katie Roiphe's book raises critical questions which concern not only the relationship between Dodgson and Alice Liddell, but the very idea of attraction between humans.That he was attracted to Alice, to the point of obsession, is not in question. Was he sexually attracted to her? In truth, we can never know, but in examining the nature of attraction, especially in the light of the 20 year age difference, we are lead into many interesting areas.Katie Roiphe's projection that he finally made the quantum leap into photographing Alice naked, as he had done with other young girls, is not entirely unreasonable. The reclining nude 'study' of Evelyn Hatch is one of the few surviving examples of his child nude phase. Apparently he took a substantial number of child nude photographs, of which only perhaps four have survived.Whether the attraction was based on past-life karma, mere aesthetics or something darker is again unknown. His sexual attraction to an eleven year old Alice is not unthinkable as there is an inevitable level of male biological response to the presence of sexually maturing females, based on a simple reproductive urge. While there is no estrus response as such in humans, there will be other factors, other signals, which trigger attraction and the equivalent of a mating ritual.His attraction of whatever kind to the four year old Alice, is more problematic. Given his ability to think in child-like fantasy terms, as evinced by the books, it may be that at some level, the four year old in Carroll had a simple crush on the young Alice, and that simultaneously he projected her future development into adult form as a possible future soul mate.There is still debate over whether he actually proposed to the eleven year old Alice, and whether this, rather than the nude photography, may have been the final straw for her family.Whatever the reality may have been, Roiphe's story is challenging and well developed, and not entirely unsympathetic to his situation, projected or otherwise. Roiphe's view seems to be that even if he was sexually attracted to her, he did at least control himself.For me, the bottom line in terms of the real world, is that if there is a male hanging around your family 'because he loves children so much', there is a 99% chance he has pedophile tendencies and should not be trusted under any circumstances.The downside of Carroll/Dodgson is that he was a pompous oaf, who wrote very condescendingly about others, imagining that he could charm his way into the lives of an infinite number of young girls and their often witless parents.Was he a calculating monster? I think not. Was he in love with Alice? Yes. Were his attentions and the form they took excessive? Yes.Somewhere in between those who dismiss him as a pedophile and those who would completely whitewash his disturbing obsessions, may well lie the truth.

After the Williams/Spielberg "Hook" fiasco, I wondered if even Disney could actually pull of a worthy sequel to their classic Peter Pan movie. I needn't have worried. Almost fifty years on, Return To Never Land fully recaptures the magic of the original.One reason this works so well is that the modern animators have remained true to the original character and set designs. Add to this an inspired piece of voice casting, which was essential and entirely successful in the Hook, Pan and Smee characters, and you have a fairly seamless continuation of the classic story.There are a few minor technical glitches, such as Wendy taking her son to the "bomb shelter" instead of the "air raid shelter" or "Anderson shelter", the appearance of Stuka dive bombers on a night raid, and the emergency vehicles using a type of siren that did not appear in Britain until the sixties. Still, this hardly detracts from what is a first class piece of entertainment.The animation is superb throughout and at times, simply breathtaking, especially the aerial sequences and the arrival of Hook's ship. On the heels of the utterly superb Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Return To Never Land is yet another example of Disney stamping their authority on the world of animation.The modern touches also work well in the mix, such as when Hook's ship passes through a mandala-laden stargate to reach the Never Land. The directions, "second star to the right and straight on till morning" were probably an allusion to Sirius, which was suspected of being a binary (twin) star even at the time of the original Peter Pan book.I know some people were disappointed with the movie and I respect their opinions, but for me, it worked brilliantly, and the soundtrack contains some classic songs. My youngest daughter watched it four times in a row upon getting it home (we bought it this morning - the release date for Canada) and she's normally a pretty stern critic of anything "average".A breathtaking first fifteen minutes and a beautiful ending sandwiching a highly entertaining middle section. Hey, that can't be so bad.

Wow. What an excellent collection of reviews. Proof, if it were needed, that Sci Fi fans are a cut above your average Joe and Josephine.Yes, The Forever War is a Vietnam allegory, and one of the ways in which it succeeds mightily is in the way our hero becomes increasingly alienated from his HomeWorld, and re-enlists.Of the two-tour Vietnam Vets I know, including two Army Nurses, they all said the same thing - that they could no longer identify with the World they had returned to and felt that the familiar madness of Vietnam beckoned them infinitely more.TFW is a fascinating book in the way it portrays the Einsteinian temporal paradoxes and their effects on Earth and Earth Forces in the field, fighting many light years away. The impossibility of having effective real-time command and control from Earth is just one of the factors that makes the war seem pointless.Many Vietnam Vets found that Time seemed to pass at a different rate In Country compared to the States (which they called The World). Only when you entered your Short period, when you got down to your last 99 days, when you became a two-digit midget, or your last 9 days, when you became a one-digit midget, did Time begin to resume any kind of linear perspective.While it's true to say that the only good thing about war is its ending, war is not always futile. When it is undertaken without a very clear attainable objective, i.e. something which makes it 'winnable', such as the Forever War and the Vietnam War, there is a crushing sense of futility, which comes across well in this book.

Like British Army Nurse Florence Nightingale before her, and American Army Nurse Sharon Ann Lane (KIA, 312th Evac., Chu Lai, 1969, Vietnam) after her, Frances Slanger was a true heroine.Bob Welch struck gold when a former Nursing comrade of Slanger's read one of his articles and got in touch. Previously, details about Frances Slanger had been slightly scant and it had been reported that she had been killed by an Enemy sniper. Welch gets it right in indicating that she had actually been killed during an artillery barrage.Even by Day 3, the slowly expanding Normandy beach heads were a dangerous place to be. Despite overwhelming Allied airpower, involving thousands of combat sorties per day, the Germans were still putting up determined resistance on the ground.Even the act of wading ashore was not without its dangers, especially given that Frances Slanger was barely five feet tall. She was one of only four nurses to land at Normandy while it was still an intensely active combat zone. Yet in spite of the mines, the snipers, the artillery exchanges and the odd air attack, Slanger and her courageous sisters pitched in immediately to help care for the endless influx of wounded.A few months later, she became the first Army Nurse KIA of the post-Overlord campaign.While ever America can still produce women like Frances Slanger and Sharon Ann Lane, and men like the brave young warriors that they gave their own young lives to support, the enemies of Freedom will never win.Never.An outstanding book.

Easily one of the most beautiful and sensitively acted and directed movies I have ever seen, made all the more hauntingly beautiful being set against the backdrop of World War II.I was 18 in 1971 and as I stood on the tarmac at RAF Kai Tak in Hong Kong, watching an American C-130 taking troops back to Vietnam, the idea that most of us were still virgins was very much on my mind.At that time, I could certainly identify with Hermie and the boys, in regarding virginity as something that you needed to 'get rid of'. Thankfully, when I did lose my virginity several years later, it was under very beautiful circumstances, and like Hermie, with a woman I loved. In that moment I almost felt sorry for the guys who had lost theirs in meaningless couplings with women they felt nothing for.Sorry to babble, but I just wanted to convey why this very special movie means so much to me, as it obviously does to the many fine reviewers who have written such wonderful and intelligent reviews.I have always loved the work of Michel Legrand and he was the perfect choice for this exquisite soundtrack.I hope young males especially will appreciate this movie and the underlying message that losing your virginity in a shallow, mechanical way is truly meaningless. You have achieved nothing. Don't rush it or feel peer pressure, because as Hermie found, this is how beautiful it really can be.I'm still crazy about Jennifer...

In addition to the versions on Clip and Dilate, the four versions of Joyful Girl on this CD make More Joy an essential purchase for the serious Ani fan. Amazingly, each of the six versions provides a unique slant on one of Her most haunting songs.If I had to pick my favourite version, it would probably be the live version with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra (track 4), which is simply exquisite. Just hit the Repeat button and fall into the arms of the Great Mother.

Ha-harrrrrrrrrrr mateys... I must confess I bought this superb album for the song The Derelict (Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum), which is one of the best versions I have ever heard, along with the version by The Bilge Pumps - Craig Lutke and the rest of those old salty sea dogs - uh, from Texas.I can vouch for the physical quality of this CUTOUT CD too. Perfect condition. Haunting and original cover art.Chris, the singer with the Flaming Groovies, has one of the best voices in Rock, and songs like If Wishes Were Horses really are a showcase for his talent. Classic song, great singer.Whether original songs or covers, Chris always delivers, and this is one tight backing band. A superb album which I would highly recommend, especially if you have a Pirate thing going on.Arrrrrrrr...

A timeless album from the boys, and a great collection of songs. When I was growing up (in England), just about every household we ever went to had this album - even a lot of English folk music fans loved the Clancies and Tommy M. You can't be a Folk fan and not love Irish music.My one regret is that this album lacks a traditional version of Wearin' O The Green (the Wolfe Tones covered it on Profile). Like so many classic Irish rebel songs, Rising Of The Moon was written about the 1798 United Irishmen uprising, and is the same air as WOTG, but lyrically it lacks some of The Green's power. WOTG was about the banning of the shamrock and St. Patrick's Day by the English, and when they sang "They're hanging men and women there, for the wearin' o' the green" they weren't kidding.This beautifully remastered CD contains a very informative booklet, which gives something of the history of each song, and which singer is featured, as well as details about each of the boys, including Pat's former IRA connections. Street cred, or what?There are so many standout songs here, including Tipperary Far Away (sometimes known as Sean Tracy) and The Wind That Shakes The Barley, which features the golden voice of Tommy Makem. While Tommy's version is quite simply the best rendition ever by a male, the greatest version by a female remains Lisa Gerrard's version on Toward The Within by Dead Can Dance (available through Amazon).Truly a wonderful album, full of love, passion and ancient wisdom.

Arrrr... When Captain William Kidd was hanged at Execution Dock in London on May 23rd, 1701, his body was suspended in a cage (gibbeting) as a warning to those tempted by the ways of piracy. Such was his legend as a pirate, that there is a pub called the Captain Kidd in the same locale to this day.Yet the legend never really covered the fine detail of Kidd's life and career, and we must be grateful to Richard Zacks for this exceptional piece of research.As other reviewers have done such a bang up job of describing the content, I will just add that this is a superb companion volume to David Cordingly's equally excellent Under The Black Flag. Both men have delved very deeply to create their magnificent contributions to the history of piracy.It certainly does seem that the Scottish-born Kidd had been betrayed one way or another, and that he had in fact been more of a troubled privateer than a true pirate. Perhaps his biggest mistake was in trusting the officials who employed him.As Bob Dylan once wrote, some men rob you with a gun, others rob you with a pen.

This is one of those rare movies that even exceeds the hype surrounding it. A brilliantly produced and directed movie in which the well-chosen cast, headed by Depp, Knightley, Rush, Bloom and Davenport execute flawlessly, making this one first class piece of entertainment.As in any movie, there are a few minor glitches, such as Kevin McNally using the American pronunciation of 'leverage', but on the whole, this has far fewer flaws in terms of continuity etc. than most movies.I bought the Lost Disc, 3-disc version , which of course has even more extras than the 2-disc version, and for the serious fan, there is just about everything you could wish for in terms of insights into the production, cast interviews, special effects etc. My only complaint is that the Blooper Reel, which is highly entertaining, is far too short. They must have been able to add in more than they actually let us see.Absolutely wonderful.

While often classified as a horror novel, The Girl In A Swing is actually far too complex to be boxed into a single genre. The story uses a mermaid metaphor to unfold this tale of transition and mutual transformation. (The story is even based in Copenhagen, with its famous mermaid statue.) As in all mermaid folklore, the siren-like Karin has to sacrifice something precious in order to enter the world of her mortal lover. This hinted-at infanticide which has parallels in Goethe's Faust, is one of the main Gothic splinters that drives the horror level of the story. Karin is truly an enigmatic character, being simultaneously The Goddess Incarnate and a star-crossed mermaid who craves the transition into mortal womanhood, like a darker version of Ibsen's Lady From The Sea. However tragic the relationship may appear, the underlying theme of the transforming power of the Feminine (which even appears in Chocolat and Mary Poppins) lifts the novel onto another level. Just as Faust is saved by the love of a servant girl who has been driven to madness and infanticide by the patriarchal arhitecture of misogyny, so too the male protagonist in TGIAS surrenders to the Chaos of Being, retaining one foot firmly in the Otherworld. If guilt and alienation turn your crank, this is for you. Happy ever after? That depends on what and who you are and where you have come from.

While the movie may have its flaws, it succeeds well as a time-twisting tale of star-crossed lovers. While the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys was more powerful and dramatic in the way it explored temporal paradoxes, The Lake House still manages to achieve the same spine-tingly feel at all of its peak moments.To me, the story is allegorical, in that we are all star-crossed lovers, and that we are constantly at the effect of time and destiny, of missed opportunities and beautiful moments of convergence.While the mailbox acts as a time portal for their communications, our subconscious minds, our collective sixth sense, can act the same way, if we could just be still and learn to listen to our hearts.A sweet movie, and a very intelligent 'love will find a way' feel-good movie. Not too many of those around.

Not really. While the Kate Bush comparisons are inevitable (Jemma delivered a stunning performance on A Tribute To Kate Bush) this gal is a major talent in her own right.Easy is a very powerful debut album, containing many stunning songs, such as All That I Am (classic single material), Dandelion, Easy, Learning To Breathe and the breathtaking One For The Road.JP doesn't have to try to sound like Kate Bush, she simply does sound like Kate Bush, and to hear the Kate-like vocals over so many solid original songs, gives one a spine tingly feeling. Jemima Price is a welcome revelation, both as a superb songwriter and as the closest thing to Kate we've got. I just hope we don't have to wait five years between Jemima's albums.Please don't be put off by the people who wrongly criticized the Tribute album. This woman is genuinely gifted.

I am not given to writing negative reviews and I cannot ever recall giving anything one star before, but this machine is a joke.I have probably used 6 different types of 'weed whacker' over the years and this is by far the worst starting machine of any kind (even given that 2 stroke engines are the work of the Devil) I have ever attempted to use.Apart from being a nightmare to start, the wretched thing cuts out prematurely after a max of 10 minutes, either due to overheating or a lousy fuel system.Maybe I was just unlucky with this particular machine, but this monstrosity should never have slipped past quality control. That is, if they even have any.

Love it. This version of Crucify definitely tops the already excellent version on Little Earthquakes, and Winter is simply stunning.As for the covers, the Led Zep song, Thank You, is exquisite, and a wonderful tribute to her friend Robert Plant and the mighty Zeppelin. This woman rules, she's even a friend of Sci Fi icon Neil Gaiman.While she does a good job on Angie, it's a song I could live without. Smells Like Teen Spirit was a classic Rock anthem in its original form, and Tori has worked her magic on this beautiful version, in which you can indeed hear the lyrics - which actually raised my respect for Kurt's song even more.This is a vital acquisition for the serious Tori fan.

Now there's an alternate title. A beautiful movie, and a very worthy film version of Fannie Flagg's beautiful novel.While the lesbian relationship between Idgie and Ruth is far clearer in the book (the character Idgie was based on a lesbian aunt of Fannie Flagg's) it is still portrayed both sweetly and intelligently in the movie.It's hard to go wrong when you are starting out with such a stunning novel, and the cast were just flawless in the way they brought this beautiful story to life.The semi-controversial ending to the movie is such because it seems to suggest that Idgie and Ninny were the same person, whereas the book indicates they were not. I tend to suspect that the graveside note from The Bee Charmer (Ruth's affectionate nickname for Idgie) and Ninny's comment about Idgie still being seen around, are a reference to the timeless, faerie-like spirit of Idgie, as a final underscoring of the main spiritual message of the book and the movie - the transforming power of the Divine Feminine.

Naw, it doesn't really have the same ring as 'Damn it, Jim...' does it? However, this is still the only Next Gen movie that comes even close to the genius of The Wrath Of Khan, The Voyage Home and Undiscovered Country.First Contact is the Next Gen crew at their very best, and this intelligently scripted movie excels at all levels. There are also so many excellent performances in here, including a stunning Alice Krige as The Borg Queen, that this movie will keep the average fan on the edge of her/his seat.Yet it is not all intensity, and Marina Sirtis turns in a hilarious and quite frankly, very sexy performance as a tipsy Deanna Troi. It is the increased warmth between the crew members that stirs echoes of the Classic Trek crew, and had the Next Gen movies been able to duplicate the high standard set by First Contact, they would have won over a lot more fans. Sadly, Insurrection and Nemesis never delivered on the promise of this genuine classic.Will they make another movie to repair the lost credibility over Nemesis? I don't know. After all, I'm just a reviewer Jim, not a miracle worker.Definitely an important purchase. Damn it.

The other reviewers have pretty well covered it. This show was as good as it gets, and it never seems to date with time.This book is an invaluable guide to the greatest show/series of all time, and represents oustanding value. The pairing of Dick and Mary was a stroke of genius, and the chemistry between them lifted this brilliantly conceived and well-written series onto another level. Remember the 'Nuts' episode?Even the cutesy touches, such as the way Dick randomly tripped over or side-stepped the ottoman just added to the seemingly endless magic that was the Dick Van Dyke Show.I had been itching to get my paws on this guide ever since I read Mary's autobiography After All, in which she rightly sings the show's praises - they both won Emmys of course - and this Definitive History illustrates just why it was out there on its own.A wonderful book, and absolutely essential for the serious fan of this unique and unforgettable series.

With this film's history, especially the struggle to gain realistic distribution and to restore something of the original content, you simply cannot afford to let this superb 2 disc set slip by. It has taken many years to get this much together, and if it were to become unavailable... I strongly urge you to get it while you can.Whether we will ever see a more complete version is a total unknown, but this exquisitely packaged set offers the fullest version yet seen, primarily consisting of the scenes on the Scottish mainland which set the background to Howie and the mystery letter mentioning the disappearance of Rowan Morrison.This is unquestionably an Art movie, in the same sense that Jacob's Ladder and Don't Look Now (a Wicker Man stablemate) were. Yet it manages to entertain on many levels, being both visually and aurally compelling.The soundtrack by the sadly late Paul Giovanni is simply stunning and the recently-released soundtrack album, which includes the haunting Gently Johnny, is another must for the serious fan. The Wicker Man soundtrack has always been the Unholy Grail of soundtrack albums, so again, I wouldn't let it slip away.There have been so many superb reviews that I won't go into plot details here, but I would like to attest to the excellent job the creators of this wonderful 2 disc set have done, right down to the ingenious wooden case. The Extras are superb, especially the lengthy interview/documentary footage with Hardy and Shaffer and the excellent Ingrid Pitt, Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. While through no fault of her own, Ingrid's role is barely more than a cameo, Woodward and Lee give some of the best performances of their impressive careers.While I would not consider the movie to be a Horror movie as such, the suspense builds majestically, and the only violence is entirely in context. Similarly, the nudity is tasteful and entirely valid within the context of a movie set in a pagan community. Britt shines in Willow's temptress dance and Ingrid Pitt delivers a masterfully understated and all-too-brief wordless performance in the search scene where Howie enters her cottage unannounced, to find her in the bath. If you're a total Ingrid Pitt fan, as I always have been, the Step and Slow keys will enable you to savor this vampish delivery.This is one of those rare movies in which the sets, the music, the casting, the locations, the production and direction and screenplay simply cannot be faulted. Having bought the superb making-of book Inside The Wicker Man from Amazon UK, this double DVD is just the icing on the cake, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

That line from the wistful Boony Rat Song gives you some sense of the fragile beauty of some of these Nam Vet classics.One of my Army Nurse friends bought me this album as a gift and I cannot thank her enough.There isn't one dud track on the entire CD and some of the songs, such as Cobra Seven, really capture the die-for-each-other heroism that makes it all the more disgusting that these brave men and women were never honored for their sacrifice.If you are a Vet you will understand what I am about to say, if not, please trust me, that if you meet a Vietnam Vet, whether it be a combat vet or a Nam Nurse, the most important words they can ever hear are 'Welcome Home'. Because they never heard it when they came back from Vietnam.Blessings to Lydia and the boys for sharing this stunning collection with us all.

A great starter book that will get you up and running with a good personal web page or site (multiple connected pages) in a short time, or even a basic business site.One staggeringly DUMB thing is that the first reference to a web SITE rather than merely a page is on page 11. No mention on the cover either. Most people are more familiar with the term web site than web page, so this is a very questionable omission, which may have cost them book sales.If the book has a weakness, it is that it places too much emphasis on catering for older generation browsers, suggesting that Netscape Composer will build pages that older browsers will usually be able to read. Although, even here, I'm not so sure they are correct.I created a basic read-only multi-page site in Composer under Netscape 7.1 and when I looked at the HTML source code, it was using HTML 4.1, (i.e. current HTML) and by the fact that it mentioned DTD's (Document Type Definitions), it must be leaning in an XML direction. However, by the fact that it did not generate an end slash after the (empty) &quot;br&quot; (line break) tag, for example, it does not go all the way to being XHTML compatible.One problem here is that 95-97% of surfers will not have older generation browsers, and to compromise going ahead with XML and ultimately, XHTML standards (the ONLY way to go for the future) will not be helpful to you or your web host.Many web hosts wince if you say you have built a web site in Composer, and whine about 'inelegant code'. What they are really talking about is forward compatability i.e. dragging web design and Net standards out of the stone age.It is definitely advisable to manually convert any generated code to XHTML format and use a checking tool such as WC3 Validator, which I don't think this book even mentions.It also fails to adequately distinguish between the nature of a read-only website and a fully interactive one, with a MYSQL database. It does mention that any add-on such as forms necessarily includes data storage and it does mention CGI and Perl (server-end software), but the detail in this area is somewhat lacking.These are not heavy criticisms on my part. I love the For Dummies series, and this is a very good basic book. It will certainly suffice for most people, in that many of the explanations of the basics are excellent. Just a few tweaks and it would have been perfect.Oh, what the heck, give 'em a seegar anyway.

This album represents ridiculous value, so please don't be put off by the low price.For me, the standout songs are Wearing Of The Green (sadly few Irish artists have recorded this utter classic), Boys Of County Cork (the boys who beat the Black and Tans), Home Fires, The Pursuit Of Farmer Michael Hayes and A Nation Once Again. All of these song versions are every bit as good as anything you have ever heard by any Irish artist.Home Fires is particularly strong, being a strident version, driven by some of the most emotive and attacking pipes playing I have heard in years. The version of A Nation Once Again is very sensitive and beautiful, and captures elements of the song that have been lost in cruder versions by other artists.If this album contained The Wind That Shakes The Barley, I would rate it as one of the best albums of all time. Having said that, the greatest version of that song is still the version by Dead Can Dance (featuring Lisa Gerrard), from their album Toward The Within. To be sure.If you are looking for a powerful and varied collection of Irish Rebel music, this album plus The Clancy Bothers And Tommy Makem's Rising Of The Moon and the Wolfe Tones' Rifles Of The IRA (all available through Amazon) will definitely hit the spot.As I said, ridiculous value.

While this film succeeds as a classic high adventure war movie, the use of actual Mosquitoes was indeed the real attraction.At the time of filming, there were only three airworthy planes (as you can tell when they buzz the airfield) and the planes used were the BIV bomber versions, with painted over plexiglass noses, to make them look like fighter-bombers. The FB version had a door in the side of the plane, whereas you climbed up into the bomber version.Technical accuracy? Who cares? It's just a pleasure to see ANY Mosquito flying for real, and the sound of those Merlins, especially where they buzz the tower and when they are practicing along the valley in Scotland, is a joy to the ears.Ten stars wouldn't be enough to praise this movie. An absolute classic by any standards. Nice also to see the mighty Cliff Robertson as the Squadron Leader, with his Eagle Squadron shoulder flashes proudly displayed.Utterly superb.

I can only vouch for the VHS version, but this movie is a total classic. While it has a solid message about the futility of popularity and the innate human urge to make tribal judgements about others, it is also a delicious piece of entertainment.Pat Dempsey gives a stellar performance as Ronald McDonald Miller, the RoboNerd who fakes his way into the fast lane, and Amanda Peterson proves she is more than just serious eye candy with a sensitive and intelligent portrayal of the head cheerleader and Ron's dream girl. Yet in spite of a brilliant performance in a very very hip teen movie, Amanda didn't seem to do any films worth a dang after this classic. What an outrageous waste of talent.The excellent supporting cast, script and John Hughes quality direction make Can't Buy Me Love one of the most refreshing and intelligently "feel good" movies of all time. LOVE the ending.

Ben Kingsley's inspired performance as Feste is just one of the highlights in this simply stunning interpretation of Twelfth Night.I totally concur with the other reviewers who have rated this so highly, along with Ken B's gorgeous Much Ado, for example. I bought this based on the cast alone, but to be honest, it even exceeded my expectations.Just as Shakespeare played around with gender/androgyny in As You Like It, in which Rosalind cross-dressed in order to gain information etc. he excels in Twelfth Night by also adding twins into the mix - he was the father of twins, himself.I really cannot recommend this delightful and hilarious production highly enough.My tale is told...

A very powerful film, which richly deserves the praise it has accumulated over the years.Beresford certainly shone in this, one of this finest moments, and the cast, especially Woodward, Brown and Thompson were just superb.I read the Kit Denton book Case Closed many years ago, and the movie appears to be partly based on that. Information seems to have come to light after the event, such as Kitchener's diaries confirming the order to shoot 'enemies' wearing British uniforms in any form, and the evaluation of Morant's 'psychotic' character by some of his fellow troopers. However, it doen't really change the central issue of putting soldiers on trial for political reasons, while the gin-swilling politicians continue to mess things up from thousands of miles away.The British made such a hash of the Boer War(s) that it is no surprise that two thirds of their war dead died from disease rather than enemy action. Likewise the thousands of Boer women and children who died in the British concentration camps (the Brits invented them to 'concentrate' the prisoners into a manageable environment) only died due to administrative incompetence, not through any attempt to harm them.It was against this background that an Aussie BVC patrol were put on trial for summarily executing Boer prisoners, whom some claim were coming in to surrender. Yet there is so much that we can never really know in this case, as so much of what was believed to be evidence has been contradicted, such as whether one of the Boers had really been wearing a dead British officer's (Morant's friend) army pants.Was Morant a 'killer'? If he was, then so was Kitchener. Perhaps the main difference was that some people kill with a stroke of a pen and others with a 303 rifle.As with the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, there has to be accountability in war. No question. But it is also inappropriate to place a bunch of young men in harm's way, in an asymmetrical warfare situation, and expect them to be immune to provocation and imminent physical danger, and to react calmly and rationally in every case.It clearly was a politically-motivated show trial and the men should never have been executed, even if a trial had actually been warranted. I'm not anti-British, I grew up in the UK, I'm just anti British stupidity.

A powerhouse of a book that is virtually unique in its scope and in the way it tackles the issues head on. There will still be those who claim to doubt Greer's conclusions and even the existence of Aliens, but who cares?The skeptics and their infantile resistance are now completely irrelevant. The existence of Aliens, to use a catch-all term, is a no-brainer - it is not in question.The question is, can we deal with the full implications of Disclosure?It is one thing to begin to introduce the previously suppressed New Technologies in order to help out the human race and accelerate the healing of the planet, but quite another to come clean about the full extent of the Alien presence.Way back in the sixties, the Brookings Institute concluded that the human race was just too primitive and spiritually immature to deal with the introduction of an Alien race, however benign. Many UFO buffs have dismissed those findings, because they themselves were totally ready for Contact. I agree. Most UFO buffs ARE ready, and have been for decades.And then there's the rest of humanity.The burning of Harry Potter books - a children's fantasy - was a very serious reminder that even the slightest threat to certain people's religious belief systems can trigger madness. And if you think that was just a few nuts, think again.Real live Aliens, with their archetypally demonic appearance are a little up the scale from Joanne Rowling's roly-poly fictional characters.Yes, the human race has a right to know, but whether they should be told at this point in their evolution, is quite another matter. Believe me, the control groups who have had direct Contact have not fared very well, and the idea of unleashing a Pandora's Box of global hysteria - a one-way thing - has to be taken very seriously.Before anybody thinks I am spouting Disinformation, nothing could be further from the truth. We just need to approach the idea of letting the humans into the light with extreme caution. Steven has written a remarkable book, but the greatest emphasis now needs to be on how do we approach final Disclosure, and more importantly, when.After the insult of the Roswell denials, many of us are just itching for the Government to come clean and admit to their vast catalog of lies. But not at any price, guys. It can't be at any price.

Jenkins tackles a very difficult subject in a very professional manner. As Dennis Littrell suggested, Jenkins realizes that the 'trap the end user' approach will never even slow down the growth of this disturbing industry, and some of the more Draconian measures being suggested in some circles would only damage the freedom to surf of normal everyday users.One point that many people might be unaware of is the fact that child pornography often involves children under five, as Jenkins suggests. Clearly this flies in the face of 'normal' sexual and reproductive urges, whereby males are only supposed to respond to females who are in the throes of puberty and beyond.While it is certainly true to say that mere child nudity does not equate to child pornography, a common tactic of borderline sites is to place 'trigger' pictures in with legitimate 'lolita-esque' nude photos, which then lead to screens or sites that appear to offer a portal to an actual child pornography site, rather than plunging people straight into one.The problem with writing books of this nature is that the Law is often in a state of flux. One of biggest 'gray' areas in terms of legality is the use of artificially generated/cgi child pornography. The 'pro' arguments suggest that as no children are being harmed or exploited, it doesn't qualify as child pornography. The 'contra' arguments suggest that it still involves images of adults having sex with children. At the time of writing this review, I believe it is still techincally legal.Some years ago, a man was arrested for some sketches he made of naked adults and children embracing, without any specific suggestion of sexual contact. The counter argument to the prosecution stance made the point that drawing a sexual fantasy (or now, creating it with a computer graphics package) rather than merely thinking the same thoughts, should not be illegal, unless any attempt was being made to circulate it/them. The point being that this transition from a thought image to a cgi image, borders on the question of the Thought Crime of George Orwell's 1984, and the Inquisition logic of 'If she floats she's a witch and if she drowns, she's innocent'.Jenkins has some solid ideas, such as monitoring message boards and the infrastructure by which the sub-net is able to operate, rather than setting up fake sites to lure in Joe Idiot who's just had a few beers, and thinking that such actions will ever impact the industry.One of the biggest factors in the quantum growth of the 'CP' industry is the availability of white, Eastern European child victims. Previously, white children were never available in such numbers, which seems to have been a natural limiter on certain areas of this darkest of growth industries.Sadly, where ever there is poverty, there will always be exploitation, and the online CP industry is just one part of a bigger picture - of a World and a people gone wrong, and the failure of the human race to love each other in the face of all our differences.Yes, read this and be concerned about the sexual exploitation of children, but never forget that the greater obscenity is that 34,000 children DIE every day throughout the same world in which some rich people have gold-plated bath taps.

As I indicated in my review of debunker Karl Pflock's Roswell book, there is an erroneous belief that if you can disprove the Roswell Incident, you have automatically debunked all UFO reports. How ridiculous.This is the case they feel they HAVE to crush in order to get a handle on disempowering the pro-UFO/Alien lobby. When you watch this movie, you will understand why.Roswell is a very well made movie, with an excellent cast, which features some powerful performances by Kyle Mac and Dwight Yoakam above all.The UFO debunkers will hate it because it tells the story of an actual Alien incident including the recovery of at least one semi-telepathic crash survivor.Some contemporary UFO purists will have a problem because of the artistic license taken and the fact that it seems like Marcel was stuck between a rock and a hard place, having wanted to release the true account of the crash - whereas now some people believe that Marcel was told to release an exaggerated 'crashed disk' report by Blanchard, which was then pulled/denied in true disinformation style.Whatever the theorizing, this movie tells a fairly traditional Roswell story, which includes all of the main elements of the discovery and cover-up. If anything, as another reviewer said, a worst case scenario.The Project Mogul balloon that debunkers keep whining about, DID have a roughly disk-shaped instrument gondola suspended way beneath it, but nobody in their right mind could EVER mistake it for a craft that was capable of independent flight, even if it had become totally separated from the mother balloon, which seems not to have been the case, per their own debunking mythology.This movie has a feel about it that just gets under your skin, and for many reasons, flaws and artistic license or not, it flows more like a documentary of Marcel's life than a piece of pure fiction. When you compare the flow and feel of this movie with the infantile ramblings of debunkers such as the barely literate Kal K. Korff (yeah, KKK), you cannot help but feel that the movie is the closest thing we might ever know to the Truth.The idea that the whole Incident was a piece of disinformation, to fool the Russians or whatever, falls apart instantly for 10,000 reasons and is perhaps the most ludicrous suggestion of all.No, something unusual came down in Roswell, and until the Government comes clean, and stops fabricating seemingly deliberately absurd 'explanations', the story told in this movie may be considered a very reasonable possible scenario.Very highly recommended.

While A Walk On The Beach represents the final part of a divine trinity of books, the internal divine trinity is the coming together of the two Joans in the presence of the Sea - which has always been a metaphor for Consciousness, the Womb of the Great Mother.Joan Anderson is a great observer of Life and the human experience, and her ablity to articulate the way people think and feel, especially in the context of relationships, of all kinds, is unsurpassed.That she should meet Erikson's wife in a beach/seashore setting, especially in Cape Cod, Mass, in magical New England, the virtual birthplace of what is now the United States, is most interesting - the seashore also being a symbolic point of transition for a mermaid/siren figure seeking transformation into mortal womanhood, as in The Girl In A Swing, by Richard Adams (also an excellent movie).With the two Joans, the transformation is mutual, as these wisewomen unfold their lives in quite different marital circumstances.For the record, Erikson the psychologist extended Freudian theory by factoring in the effects of culture and environment to the stages of human development rather than merely biological influences. To Erikson, development was a lifelong process. The main criticisms of this work focused on his gender and ethnocentric bias. The later, Third Wave psychology of Maslow and after, addressed the individual's relationship to the Universe itself, rather than the experiential layer generated by society.Joan Erikson herself continued to expand on the work she had done with her husband with her own hands-on experience of old age (she was 90 when the Joans met), and Joan A was able to benefit from this wisdom first hand. Similarly, she was able to help Joan Erikson with her own major life adjustments, including the impending death of a Life partner, by sharing her own growth lessons as she re-structured her thinking as she moved into the second stage of her life.I can see why some people regard this as 'a woman's book', (I disagree, it's a thinking PERSON'S book) but as a man with four daughters who has published a book about the suppression of the Feminine, I found it intriguing. The beautiful interactions between these two remarkable unfinished women reminds you that menopause and after is supposed to be a sacred transition, not a form of mental illness, as we have been programmed to believe.Invaluable.

Superb. This is still my favourite of all Pamela's books and a true Rock Culture classic. Anybody who was Frank Zappa's nanny and Jimmy Page's girlfriend in the same lifetime has to be worth reading - and this gal can write.Unlike some books, this is in no way a name-dropping cash-in. Pamela actually did all these things, was all these things. She WAS Don Johnson's girlfriend, and buds with a young Vince Furnier (Alice Cooper), Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Moon etc. with an awesome collection of photos to prove it.Written with the wisdom and humility that only comes with the approach of middle age, (when, in my opinion, women are just beginning to enter their prime), IWTB is a very human look under the hood of the Rock Machine. There are so many delicious insights into the whole Led Zeppelin era, that by the time you have devoured the book, you feel like you had actually been there.Unfortunately IWTB is presently out of print, but her ElectricGypsy website may have some information about future availability. If not, keep surfing Amazon. It will be worth the wait.

...after such a stunning box office triumph.People who see this as formularized, might consider the idea that if you have a formula that entertains off the scale, as with Lord of the Rings and Pirates I, it would be ridiculous to stray too far from that.The story works, the cast works; it's a fantastic bridging movie to the final part of the trilogy, which should be absolutely stunning.The legend of Jack Sparrow lives on..."Oi, that's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, if you don't mind..."Sorry guv'nor...

People used to laugh at the Australian film industry, and frankly, there had been some stinkers, but this is the one that put them on the map, for all time.Picnic At Hanging Rock, with its stunning cinematography and otherworldly hybridized forays into classical mythology, simply blew everything else out of the water, the year of its release.There have been a number of good reviews, so I won't re-hash anything, I would just implore you to do yourself a favor and see this utter work of Art.I would like to have seen a bevvy of extra features, but this is worth having come what may.It really is as good as you have heard.

As a non-Jew with Jewish friends, I found it highly entertaining, but it does seem to have annoyed a few people.To me, the whole Jewish Conspiracy issue comes down to one question...If the Jews run the World and always have, how come Israel is the Whipping Boy of the United Nations?

Alice's "Lucky" memoir was ironically titled as a comment on an insensitive statement by a police officer after Alice was "only" raped, unlike the last woman to be attacked in the same location, who had been brutally murdered. Like singer/songwriter Tori Amos, who co-founded RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) Alice is a rape survivor, and this brutal life-changing event fuelled the brilliant yet disturbing novel The Lovely Bones.What follows is just my own take on the story. We all interpret things differently, so here we have my two cents' worth...Like the Tim Robbins movie Jacob's Ladder, The Lovely Bones is the victim's Book of the Dead journey of the soul. The heaven she describes does not exist except as the quantum reality that the Between Lives Area manifests as. No, we cannot die. We can lose our bodies, but we go on and eventually come back and back and back... and I have had enough past life regression to be quite sure about that.(Spoiler-ish thingy coming up...) Where she interacts with Ruth, in the form of a temporary Walk In or benign possession, this may actually take place or it may be a fantasy, we have no way of knowing, nor does she.The name Salmon may have been chosen to represent the cycle of Return. Salmon live in the sea until maturity - between 1 and 7 years, depending on the species; and some migrate hundreds, and even thousands of miles in the sea. They then somehow return to the place where they hatched and continue the Cycle. No-one knows how salmon can possibly find their way home. Susie Salmon finds her way back to revisit the people she spent her brief life with as part of a greater finding her way Home.As for the connection between all things, the subject of Non-Locality as it relates to prayer and spiritual issues/human relationships, hinges on Bell's Theorem, as proposed by John Bell in 1964. Bell's Theorem, which is supported by experimental evidence, indicates that once subatomic particles have been in contact, they always remain connected. A change in one creates a concurrent change in the other, even if they are a universe apart. Susie's connection to events can be explained both in physical terms i.e. the quantum field, and in spiritual terms, whereby her soul (which exists outside of space-time) is initially unwilling to let go of the Earth and her incomplete life.The book succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is as a much-needed reminder that we must do everything possible to eradicate the basis for male violence against women.Steven Cain, author of Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine.

An excellent and even-handed book. As a father of four, I would take my helmet off to Thompson and hope that I would have done the same thing in those circumstances.However, as a jumpy eighteen-year-old who had spent three months seeing his buddies slaughtered in booby trap after booby trap, having their heads blown off by snipers you never see or get to track, Army trucks full of draftees decimated by grenades thrown by smiling elderly villagers and children, I really don't know how much I would have given a damn for any village anywhere in that country.Yes, the massacre was wrong, and thank God for men like Thompson, but if anybody is going to judge My Lai or any other total breakdown of discipline and artificially-sustained morality, it should be men and women who have served in extreme combat environments, not bourgeois middle-class Liberals who have never had to get their hands dirty.Vietnam was a filthy war, and because it never had a distinct purpose or Win Scenario driving it, it was a pointless war. Ironically, one of the things that triggered My Lai was the very fear and frustration generated by the VC's own tactics, including the mutilation of American corpses and the constant goading and provocation that GI's had to endure.This was the same Enemy that massacred French garrisons and lined the approach roads with the severed heads of the defenders to demoralize the relief columns. The same Enemy that even booby trapped live babies in order to kill American soldiers and shock them into a state of psychological collapse.Read the book, by all means, and be outraged. Yet while the massacre can never be justified, with the kind of background, only some of which I have just outlined, it can perhaps be understood - above all, as others have rightly said, in the absence of strong leadership and the stability provided by having a good sprinkling of experienced Vets throughout the Company.No, it should never have happened, but then, neither should the War.

This is a wonderful version of Barrie's classic, and the casting above all, is exceptional. Rachel Hurd-Wood is a perfect choice to play Wendy, and the whole process of her transition to womanhood is handled very tastefully and intelligently. Anybody who has a problem with this, needs to see a psychiatrist.After the (to me) disappointing "Hook" I was very wary of another attempt at Peter Pan, but this one is virtually flawless, and the special effects are beautifully integrated. I was surprised that the 'mermaids' scene was so brief, as it was very dramatic and well-shot, and could have been even more powerful had it explored more elements.Isaacs is just outstanding, as is Sumpter, and it is difficult to conceive of a better cast than this one. The extras are also superb, making this an absolute bargain DVD.Truly a modern classic.

Yes, the Nike ads have captured the essence of Zen. As Alan Watts puts it, This Is It.Logical paradoxes aside, the &quot;just shut up and get on with it&quot; approach to Life is one of the key elements in Zen. The 'kill the Buddha' psychology of avoiding the pitfalls of externally arising enlightenment is well in line with Watt's own philosophy.Completeness comes from within and from a place of non-duality, which the koans of Zen are designed to lead you towards. One of the key human errors and the cause of immense suffering is the belief that Life must make sense. Who ever said that? And make sense to whom?The Techno Bible in The Hitch Hiker's Guide bore the words &quot;Dont Panic&quot; on the cover. That's a good starting point. Add to that Just Do It and This Is It, and you're going to be just fine.Another great read from the man who gave us The Two Hands Of God.

I was lucky enough to catch the reformed Pirates in the UK on this series of tours, and they were without a doubt one of the best power trios I have ever seen.Mick Green is one of the most respected and influential guitarists in the history of Rock, easily on a par with the mighty Keith Richards, and 'live' he was just something else.While ironically, he had never played on the original recording of Shakin' All Over (it was a session guy filling in for Caddy) he is THE guitarist you associate with the song, and when I saw them in Leeds, England, Mick's 'Shakin' power chords seemed to be an intriguing blend of jazz and metal.The atmosphere was electric when I saw them, and that comes across in this superb set, in which at every gig, they had the audience eating out of their hands.These boys are the real deal, and their very existence is a fine tribute to the memory of the awesome Johnny Kidd, who sadly died in a car crash in 1966.This is as good as it gets, folks.

An absolutely flawless album, which has not left my CD player since it arrived a week ago.From the dramatic opener Bad Trash, the band come at you with a non-stop collection of dark but danceable brooding classics. Tina Root's haunting voice swoops and soars majestically over the exquisite musical arrangements, sounding at times like Siouxsie and at other times like Kate Bush, yet always remaining distinctive and original. Dissolve, Wallflower, Clown, Cocoon, Dollhouse... pick a track... they are all different yet all brilliant.My thanks to the Amazon Review system and to the other fans whose reviews inspired me to buy this stunning album.

Those words from Ellen Nussey not only summed up the beautiful relationship that she enjoyed with her dear departed friend Charlotte Bronte, they also sum up the flavor of this wonderful collection of essays/articles.I bought the book originally as part of the research for my own Emily Bronte novel, and I was fascinated to discover that while there has always been speculation about Emily's orientation, there was clearly no doubt about Charlotte's.Elaine Miller's brilliantly insightful article, Through All Changes and Through All Chances, includes many striking passages from the countless love letters from Charlotte to Ellen (Charlotte's controlling husband, Arthur Bell Nicholls, destroyed all traces of Ellen's hundreds of letters to Charlie).As Elaine proves beyond doubt, the two women not only loved each other passionately, they openly harbored a long-term desire to live together until Death.As with so much of lesbian history, the biographers have usually edited out the truth of 'romantic friendships' between famous women, just as Elizabeth Gaskell may have done, at least to some degree, in her sympathetic bio of Charlotte Bronte - in this case, possibly out of a desire to protect either or both of the women.A superb piece of research. Highly recommended.

Not my words. They were the words of a modern-day Luftwaffe squadron leader, who I had the pleasure of meeting back in the seventies. His point was that nobody in their right mind could in any way justify the Holocaust. As Denying History goes on to prove, nobody in their right mind could in any way justify Holocaust denial.At the (for me) prohibitive price, I would never have bought the book, but a friend lent me his copy, for which I am most grateful. Shermer leads an unassailable destruction of the various denial approaches, from those who question the figure of six million, to the extremists who deny that there ever was a Holocaust.On a personal note, I grew up in Britain as a non-Jew, and one of my neighbours, a Mr. Hammill, was a Survivor. In the summer, when everybody slept with their windows open, you could sometimes hear him screaming in his sleep. Literally.The capacity for genocide is inherent in humans. To deny that, to deny that it DID happen to the Jews, is just the first step towards creating the basis for the next Holocaust. Denying History goes as far as is humanly possible in proving that the Jewish Holocaust did actually happen, and that virtually all of those who question the reality, have agendas of their own.

A brave album, but not the best in the boys' inventory, that's for sure. 2,000 Light Years, with its haunting mellotron intro by Brian Jones was one of the best songs of the entire Psychedelic era and easily the standout song here, although the superb She's A Rainbow and The Lantern are two other great songs.The Stones put out a superb single called We Love You in this general time period, and it always seemed like it should have been on Majesties, to me.As for influences, if you ever read background bios on the Stones and the Beatles or even catch some of the many interviews that Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger have done over the years, you realize that the bands of the time all influenced each other, and that the Stones and The Beatles were actually friends, who hung out together.Apart from the fact that many bands owed a tremendous debt to the early Blues artists, they all borrowed ideas and innovations from each other; so The Byrds, The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles couldn't fail to have an effect on each other's work - but it was all amicable, with respect being the watchword.Definitely worth having in your collection, but not a representative Stones album by any means. Beggar's Banquet or Let It Bleed would be a better entry point if you wanted to try out some classic Stones, although with this band, you pretty well can't go wrong by picking an album at random.

Yet another stunning album. Anybody who is waiting for Alanis to weaken will be collecting an old-age pension long before that is ever likely to happen, if it even could.I have been playing 'Everything' to death ever since I picked up the exceptional CD single (great video), and as today is the release date for Canada, I have just grabbed the album.Even on one playing, the album has blown me away with the consistency of the song quality throughout. This is one very solid album, and stylistically slightly different from anything that has gone before. Very much a solid Rock album, but with some very interesting experimental nuances.The Enhanced CD also has a load of extra stuff, including live performances of Eight Easy Steps and Excuses, an inside look at the making of So-Called Chaos, a special acoustic version of This Grudge, and access to an exclusive website containing We're With The Band - Alanis' improv short film spoof, and the Everything music video.Naturally, she looks as beautiful as ever. Sigh.Feel the lerve...

Having played this album incessantly for several days, I reckon it's far and away her best album since the stunning Jagged Little Pill - which was in my opinion, a landmark in Rock.Without direspecting anybody, I simply cannot imagine how some people, presumably Alanis fans, have reacted badly to this exceptional collection of songs.To me, this is one of those rare albums on which virtually every track is a potential single. Eight Easy Steps, Out Is Through, Excuses, Doth I Protest Too Much, Knees Of My Bees (hey, how about that title?) Not All Me, Spineless, and the actual single Everything, are some of the most murderously singalong songs I have ever heard - and Alanis is SUCH a strong singer, with a beautiful voice, both in lead and harmony vocals.Lyrically, the utterly haunting Doth I Protest Too Much (borrowed from Shakespeare's &quot;Methinks she/he doth protest too much...&quot;) and The Grudge, beautifully revisit Alanis Relationship Territory, yet the whole album is very up tone, presumably reflecting her own worldly yet positive state of mind.I have loved all her albums, but this goes infinitely beyond anything I was expecting. Like the stylistically different Jagged, this is yet another true work of genius.Use The Force Alanis... &quot;You don't need to see the bad reviews... Just buy this unequivocal mistresspiece...&quot;She will be mine... Oh yes...

Anything but a children's movie; Pan's Labyrinth is a hybridized Quest-based allegory about the human condition and how a child's mind deals with war and abandonment.While the movie succeeds mightily as an Art film, the darkness that underpins the contrasting of the sacrificed Feminine and the left-brain, hunter-killer male brutality, will certainly make it a hard film for many Myth Fans to watch. The violence may be largely in-context, but it is also the film's Achilles' Heel.Recommended, but not for the squeamish, even if they are Art Savvy...

Dogville works on many levels, but I suggest that it is primarily an allegory of almost Biblical proportions.This is mainly confirmed near the end, when the true power dynamic is revealed and the apocalyptic ending unfolds in dramatic fashion.There are many sub-themes on the journey to the Apocalypse, including slavery, witch hunts, racism and the suppression/exploitation of women, but for me, the greatest commentary is the way it plays out an almost Christian hybrid of Old/New Testament values.When we discover Grace's relationship to the unknown man in the limo, there is almost a suggestion that she was 'sent' into Dogville, the way Jesus Christ was sent to Earth in order to teach by example and transform people's lives and thinking, only to be ultimately persecuted and betrayed.The stark, Old Testament 'payback' ending will shock some viewers and be uplifting to others, depending on whom you identify with during the story unfoldment.It is a long and at times slow movie, but if you can work with the deliberately minimalist theater-like sets, it is well worth your time.

I totally agree with Eric, ignore the ridiculous Publishers Weekly 'review'. This is a unique record of one of the most profound human interest stories to come out of the Vietnam War. Of any war.As for criticisms of Nghia's poetry, this was the work of a combat soldier out in the field, not some prissy university type who never had to get his hands dirty. Besides, I think it's rather good...I CANNOT WAIT IN VAINMy darling, I can't take this anymore.I only know my little life.A diamond reveals its full worthWhen shining in the darkness,Inflaming sweet happiness.I only want to hear poetry as the sun sets;I promise I will be loving, faithful.Our laughter will ring out in every direction.I only want to watch the autumn sun set,Your heart beating next to mine.Our renewed life will arrive on the morning wind,Once the clouds pass by.I can totally understand Paul's need to go back and to seek some kind of reconciliation. Many of my Nam Vet friends have made similar journeys, from Chuck Ward's magnificent Vets With A Mission projects, to Colonel Janis Nark, who went with a team taking the Sons and Daughters of KIA service personnel, to Bernie Duff, Kath Fennell and author/poet Kerry Doc Pardue's work with the Sharon Ann Lane Memorial Clinic (Sharon was the first Army Nurse to be killed in Nam by enemy action - 312th Evac, Chu Lai, 1969.)Kontum Diary is one of those rare books that humanizes The Enemy and shows that in any war, young men and women who have no quarrel with each other often have to take each other's lives.These brave young men served their countries with honor, and I am very pleased that they have found a meeting place in which healing and understanding can grow and develop.I'm sure this book would be very helpful for the many Vets who are still struggling with their own healing journeys, if only because it puts a sensitive, vulnerable human face on the dark entity we only ever think of as The Enemy.May our children and our children's children never have any war stories to tell.

This is one of those classic tales set in an artificially sustained reality, such as in Shakespeare's The Tempest and Michael Moorcock's Dancers At The End Of Time and The New World's Fair.Yet The Overman Culture unfolds like a set of Chinese boxes, to finally reveal the reason for the many paradoxes, temporal and otherwise, that haunt the reader as she/he progresses through this masterpiece.Why is Sir Winston Churchill walking arm in arm with Queen Victoria as the Battle of Britain is re-fought above London's transparent pressure dome? Why do some children bleed and not others?The answers are all in there. Treat yourself. Then pick up Cooper's A Far Sunset and Sea Horse In The Sky. Trust me.

A powerful and well-intentioned film, with a great cast.If I have a problem, it is that the portrayal of Hughes is a little generous, and there was no real attempt to get inside Plath's head. We know the what and the how, but there was no real attempt to explain the why.Nor was there any mention of the fact that, in 1969, Assia gassed herself and her daughter to death - even as a footnote.Plath was one of the finest poets of all time, yet all we ever hear in the movie are tiny fragments of her genius."The Hours", featuring an inspired Nicole Kidman, did a far better job on the life of Virginia Woolf, but that is no fault of a superb Paltrow and Craig, who did everything they could with what they had to work with.Great performances throughout, but the film could have been way deeper.

Anyone who is hoping for Sarah to show any signs of weakness will be devastated by this DVD. She is absolutely on top form, both vocally and physically.Las Vegas audiences are used to seeing the best artists in the world as a matter of routine, so when you get a Vegas audience eating out of your hand the way Sarah did, you know you've got an act! The way her exquisite voice was still so strong and clear in the finale just sent the highly appreciative audience into raptures.The first time I ever saw this DVD, I watched it with a female friend who is taking classical voice training, and she laughed every time the divinely leggy Sarah came strutting down the long catwalk in a series of beautifully designed outfits. Her comment was "Yeah, she knows how good she looks!"Sarah is one of the few great Divas who, along with Tina Turner, can surround herself with beautiful young dancers and still be confident that all eyes will be on her. And they were.The track selection is excellent, and although we all have our preferences, many of her classic pieces are to be found here. The second DVD is a real bonus and gives you some extraordinary insights into the whole Sarah phenomenon.I actually like all of Sarah's concert DVDs, but with this being the most recent, this is the one that I am playing to death.Absolutely wonderful.

Yep, I agree, let's leave the comparisons with Natalie out of the picture. This is a superb album, despite the all-too common lousy editorial review (where do Amazon find these clowns?)I discovered this album by accident when I went into the TV room and was captivated by Mary's beauty in the band's cover of Bryan Ferry's stunnning song More Than This. It was only at the end of the video that I realized that it was the Maniacs.This is an exceptional album, which stands on its own.

She really has. When some bozo told Jann that she was &quot;just twenty pounds away from being on the cover of Vogue&quot;, her mother told her, &quot;You should have told them you didn't want to gain any more weight&quot;. NOBODY who looks as good as Jann did at the time of this album (check out the Wonderdrug video, for example) needs to lose a single ounce.Fashion industry madness aside, Jann Arden is a beautiful woman and superb singer/songwriter, and Living Under June is probably her best album out of a very impressive bunch. If I had to pick out my favourite song, it would probably be Good Mother, which also has a stunningly beautiful video. Still, this is an entire album of great songs - Could I Be Your Girl, Wonderdrug, the title track, and so on...To top it all off, Jann also has the most wicked sense of humour. While advertising her utterly brilliant Greatest Hurts album, she announced that disastrous relationships had made her a very wealthy woman. Still haven't caught her on tour yet, but I'll be working on it.Good job, ma'am.

I have noticed Ramsey supporters repeatedly pouncing on any books that seem to address their guilt - this being another.While the presentation of this book may be imperfect, the technology of Reverse Speech, developed by Australian researcher David John Oates, cannot be questioned. Oates himself has excellent credentials, having worked with a number of official bodies, including law enforcement agencies.The Reverse Speech website reversespeech.com has a section devoted to the Ramsey case, and one of the most haunting audio clips is the one in which JonBenet's song is reversed, and played back at three different speeds. While the effect is unsettling, the words 'Mommy, now I know evil love' can be clearly discerned by the second time through.Like Rubacher, Oates concludes that the Ramseys did not intentionally kill their daughter, a view held by many of the people who consider them to be in some way responsible for her death.One of the problems with the book content is that there is no real background to the case, so the data appears in something of a vaccuum.However, it remains one of the most intriguing insights into the case so far, and confirms the view that I have always held, that the Ramseys were responsible for the un-premeditated manslaughter of their child. The Intruder theory was provably nonsensical, and every single 'clue' that the Ramsey defenders have tried to cling to has been debunked years ago.Not only was there no clear evidence of an intruder, it was physically impossible for a killer to have had such close and prolonged physical contact with the child and yet leave no clear, full spectrum DNA behind at the crime scene.The suspect John Mark Karr has predictably turned out to be a nut job, and cleared completely of any involvement with the case.As Rubacher, Oates and others have shown, despite the carefully orchestrated propaganda from the Ramseys and their lawyers, their own unconscious words have betrayed them.

Sometimes a Best Of compilation fails to include masterpieces that were written by the lower profile band members, so you have to accept that "Best Of" is a relative term, with any great band, from The Beatles to The Moodies. While Graeme contributed many intriguing ideas, Ray and Mike were actually very strong songwriters, and they are definitely under represented here.Given that caveat, this is still a fantastic compilation, especially since it includes rare quasi-Moodies classics such as Blue Guitar and Forever Autumn. To me, if they had included Legend Of A Mind, at least one Mike epic and (stretching a bit) One Lonely Room from Justin's 'Songwriter' album, this would have been virtually perfect.As it is, it's pretty darn close.Insane value.

The first song I ever heard from this album back in '74 was A Case Of You. That was all it took for me to leap out and buy it (on double vinyl). That such an exquisite song could be even improved upon was inconceivable to me. Yet Joni did it with the 'live' version recorded here.In almost every case the songs are fresher and more vibrant than the originals - Cactus Tree from her first album being a good example. The sound quality throughout is astonishingly good, making Miles Of Aisles one of the best 'live' albums of all time, and as a double length CD, the value is just out of control.If you have heard a lot about Joni Mitchell but never really heard much of her material, this album would be a wonderful entry point to her work.An absolute classic.

While the concept of Chrono/Temporal Displacement, i.e. a character being catapulted in and out of the Time track, isn't exactly new to Sci Fi fans, Audrey doesn't rely on that to carry the story.The unusual Time fragmentation is merely a vehicle for telling a very human story of a classic pair of star-crossed lovers, through the eyes of two very well-rounded characters.Regarding the presence of 'bad language', I understand that some people might be slightly offended, but this is certainly an adult content book, and in this context, it is probably valid.However, when you decide introduce sex into a story, you need to strike a balance, in that if you are going to be at all graphic, the scenes need to be graphic enough and substantial enough to carry the physical dimensions of the relationship. To that extent, I felt that the sexual content tended to fall between two stools, in that it didn't quite develop in a fully satisfying way.There were elements of the story, especially the times when the adult Henry interacts with the young Clare (she is 6 and he is 40-ish when they first meet in The Meadow) that reminded me of the relationship between Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell. This, especially after reading Katie Roiphe's stunning novel Still She Haunts Me - available through Amazon.com.I take my hat off to Audrey for creating a very compelling first novel, which I am delighted to say has been a best seller. Certainly a breath of fresh air compared to most writers' offerings.Highly recommended.

Shakespeare's magical tribute to the transforming power of the Feminine has never looked more enchanting. As many others have said, this is thinking person's eye candy. Beautiful scenery and sets, and a cast made in fairy heaven.While the director may have taken slight liberties in this production, the essential elements - the Chinese box structure, the reality-layering, and the contrasting of Goddess Time with Linear Time, which lie at the very core of the play, are very much intact.A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest are without a doubt The Bard at his most inspired and most magical. This is a gorgeous production and yet another showcase for the seemingly limitless genius of Kevin Kline.

I was under the mistaken impression that Amazon were there to sell products, not put people off. The childish and spiteful Editorial review by Marshall Fine is completely inappropriate and misrepresents this excellent concert entirely.While I respect the views of the people who had reservations about the concert, Fine's so-called 'review' is a very different affair. That this creature should attack Sarah's 'pudgy build' - precisely the same kind of comment that triggered Karen Carpenter's ultimately fatal anorexia - speaks volmes about the kind of fool he is.Sarah, like Marilyn (size 14) Monroe, has a beautiful womanly figure. Marshall Fine obviously prefers 100 lb catwalk models to normal-looking women who understand that females are supposed to retain body fat, as a survival mechanism, they being the childbearers of the species.That aside, this is a wonderful concert which features many great songs and is a visual delight. Sarah looks gorgeous throughout, as you might expect.

I did a double take when I first saw the above pair of albums. Releasing them as one CD was simply a masterstroke. While the first album is indispensible, the thing that made me immediately place an Amazon order was the presence of Once Again. Even after all these years, I still feel that this was their finest moment. The epic mellotron-drenched She Said remains one of progressive rock's greatest milestones. Powerful melodies and superb guitar work became BJH's stock-in-trade, and the breathtaking She Said, along with the exquisite Galadriel and Mocking Bird ruthlessly drive you to overkill the superlatives. Definitely a CD for any desert island collection. You can't go wrong, folks.

There have been so many superb detailed reviews that I will just swoon...This is one very classy collection of songs and Bette delivers in style throughout. It is a rather short CD, but the quality is there in abundance.She looks devastatingly beautiful on the cover, and her warm, self-assured smile seems to be a pointer to the wonderful space she must have been in while putting this excellent collection together.Having Barry in the chair is just the icing on the cake, and perhaps a final assurance of quality and attention to detail.Brilliant.

While the definitive overall Brontes biography is Juliet Barker's 'The Brontes', and the various Bronte-related works of Edward Chitham are invaluable in their own right, this still stands as an important contribution to understanding the Brontes, and Charlotte above all.Despite its flaws, and I agree with other reviewers, that this is a rather dark picture of events, Elizabeth wrote a detailed and very sympathetic account of Charlotte's life and her relationship to her family. Her inclusion of letter content, epecially in relation to Ellen Nussey, was somewhat self-edited, and the lack of references to the romantic friendship that so clearly existed between the two women, was probably Elizabeth's attempt to protect them.For anyone who is interested in the truth of their passionate relationship, I highly recommend Elaine Miller's detailed essay 'Through All Changes and Through All Chances' from the book Not A Passing Phase, compiled by the Lesbian History Group. The letter excerpts that Elaine includes clearly indicate that Charlotte and Ellen not only loved each other, but that they jointly expressed a long-term desire to live together 'until Death'.When Ellen Nussey wanted to publish her own 'The Story of the Brontes' which would have included many excerpts from the hundreds of letters that Charlotte had sent her, Arthur Nicholls blocked permission, as he owned copyright to the contents of the letters, even though Ellen owned the letters themselves. Nicholls - Charlotte's husband of only nine months - also destroyed all of the literally hundreds of letters from Ellen to Charlotte, and even tried to insist that Ellen destroy all of Charlotte's letters to her, during Charlotte's lifetime.Elizabeth is clearly no fan of Nicholls, but that is hardly surprising in view of his destruction of so much of Charlotte's personal writing material.For an insight into the lives of Charlotte and her family and the Haworth area in that time period, this is still and always will be an important book.

Anybody who was hoping to write off Holly Mc after her maternity leave will be sorely disappointed with this album. Just as Madonna followed motherhood with her strongest album yet (Ray Of Light) Holly has done likewise with Home. Not only did Holly show her commitment to the empowerment of women by her Lilith appearances, she has also demonstrated her own power with this triumphant return.This is indeed an album of great songs and no filler. Yet there are standout songs, with the simply stunning Beautiful Blue and the murderously singalong Dallas being among the best.While Stuff, with Numb, Elmo, Porno Mouth and UFO was a powerful album, on "Home" Holly has just fine tuned the songwriting and delivered what is by any definition a classic album. There is more maturity and texture here, as evinced by pieces such as the epic closing number, More. Holly is also using her voice more effectively and displaying a range that may surprise some listeners.The haunting video to the utterly classic Beautiful Blue certainly captures the mood that permeates the album, and showcases both Holly's heavenly voice and heavenly physique. It is so refreshing to occasionally see a female star who actually looks like a real woman instead of a fashion industry stick insect. Lest we forget, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.Wonderful.

First class entertainment. BTC is one of the pitifully few Happy Ever After lesbian love movies, in that the two women neither die (High Art, Gia), nor fall into the safety net of "Confused girl marries guy in the end".While the film deals with many important issues, including the Transgender question, it is clearly out to entertain at every level. One of the highlights is Peter Outerbridge's "I'm Not An Effing Drag Queen" cabaret performance, concerning a pre-op transsexual who is outraged at the thought of being considered a mere cross dresser.In an industry in which Xena has yet to nail Gabby, (we can still hope) the love scenes in BTC are tastefully erotic and very believable. Yet another movie that proves that you don't need a big budget and star names to create superb end product.

I may be being generous wih 4 stars, but they are just for the concert footage and the meaningful interviews. The only meaningful ones for me are the ones with Mitch, Noel, Billy and Buddy and the engineer in the studio, whose name escapes me right now - but he was good.No, I don't care what Slash, Vernon Reid or Lenny Kravitz think, although I think Vernon Reid rocked with Living Color.The other reviewers have got it all right. Far too much talk from inconsequential people, no color footage from the main concert, a lot of wasted time, Race being retrofitted into the picture by people with their own agendas, and so on...One guy, it might have been the opinionated talker from The Ghetto Fighters, whoever they were, suggested that this was the band that Jimi really wanted after all, not the band that he was given to play with in England.Reality check... Jimi had FOUR top ten hits in the UK before the US even realized what that God-gifted Seattle boy was worth. He liked England, and England liked him.As for the band he was given... does this clown think a man like Jimi would have stayed with a band who didn't work for him? It has long been discussed that the Experience days were Jimi's happiest time. He was cushioned by being part of a band, and they produced some stunning music.An interview with Slash, but not Chas Chandler, the man who discovered Jimi, managed him, and whom Jimi called during his last desperate hours because of the bond the men always had...Band of Gypsies is a good album, a timeless album, but it ain't Voodoo Chile, Purple Haze, Wind Cries Mary, Hey Joe, Burning Of The Midnight Lamp, Red House, Spanish Castle Magic, All Along The Watchtower... need I go on?The actual Band of Gypsies trio were actually good. Billy Cox was no more than an adequate bass player, but Buddy Miles, while lacking Mitch Mitchell's subtle jazz flair, was a very solid and capable drummer.I also remember his work with Billy Rich on guitar genius John McLaughlin's classic psychedelia album Devotion, so the man does have talent.Incredible to think that two thirds of the band were Screaming Eagles - 101st Airborne Vets, as Jimi met Billy in the Airborne. Thankfully, the boys were out before the Airmobile shipped out to Vietnam.The DVD is worth having for the serious Hendrix fan, if only for the unique concert footage, but as other fans have said, there are waaay better Jimi DVDs around.

Whatever criticisms can be levelled against this book, I believe it to be Bill's honest attempt to reveal the Truth as he knew it, at that time.For those who are new to Conspiracy Theory, this is a mine of information, and for those who are more knowledgable, it still stands as a classic of the genre, and a very courageous book.Bill's 'convenient' death in a questionable shootout came as no surprise to most Conspiracy buffs, as the guy threw down the gauntlet in a big way. He was fearless.One fascinating addition to his Kennedy assassination info came in his video, Kennedy: The Sacrificed King, in which he examines the Zapruder film of Kennedy being hit, and by virtual frame advancing, the clip appears to show JFK's driver, William Greer, shooting JFK over his shoulder, delivering the second and probably ultimately fatal shot.As for some of his Alien info, I know military intelligence hierarchies, and Bill was only operating at a relatively low level in his Naval Intel role (whatever his supposed Clearance), so he never had access to the big picture, and he himself was vulnerable to Disinformation, as he suspected himself. What he conveys is a mixture of Truth and DI.On a technical note, the book is not a polished, edited finished product, and many of his strategies such as continuous capitalization for emphasis make it hard to read at times, but the content itself makes it well worth the effort to press on.Like so many of his brothers and sisters, the guy served his Country with honor in Vietnam. There is much to respect about the man.

One of the greatest travesties of our time is that there is no performance of this Glass masterwork available on DVD. While I have never had the good fortune to catch a performance, I saw a 'making of' documentary way back, in England and it was simply mesmerizing.Only Glass could do justice to an opera about the controversial and androgynous ruler, referred to by some New Agers as The Extraterrestrial King. The combination of Philip's trademark layered repetition techniques and his masterful grasp of the psychological and socio-political consequences of the Pharaoh's sweeping changes, makes for a magical experience for the listener.A virtually flawless work of Genius.

Chillingly accurate. As others have said, you don't need a big budget and star names to make it real. This rests in my collection next to the Aussie movie The Odd Angry Shot, which again goes for realism, not frills and sensationalism.For me, the scene that captures the nature of the Enemy and the barbarity of gloves-off, no-quarter warfare was the one in which a VC shoots up the medical bunker, with a total disregard for the Geneva Convention. After deliberately killing personnel and destroying bottles of plasma, blood and other essential supplies, he is finally killed my a female doctor with an M-16. God bless her.Compassionate representations or not, this was a ruthless Enemy, who even booby-trapped live babies in order to kill American soldiers.Firebase Gloria vividly captures the frantic scrabble to stave off annihilation by a psychotic VC assault force, who literally attacked in Korea-style human waves. Where indeed was Tac Air? The Enemy should have been swimming in napalm.One of the most gratifying moments in this video comes at the end, when the text reveals that the Enemy (mainly VC) lost as many men during Tet as the US lost during the entire Vietnam War. Militarily, Tet was a total failure. Yet it had tremendous political significance, and greatly aided the Communists back in the USA in accelerating their hijack of the Peace Movement.Don't get me wrong, I think the War was a mistake, primarily because it was entered into with no concept of a Win Scenario in mind. As the French found, you simply cannot fight a holding operation against an enemy like the NVA and VC. You either leave 'em to it, or you wipe them out.

An indispensible album for the serious Crimson fanatic. Yes, the sound quality is iffy, and some tracks are little better than good bootleg quality. However, for any fans who were right there from the beginning, this double CD set recaptures the sheer magic of the first KC lineup.Apart from the chance to get a 'live' 1969 King Crimson concert, plus many extras, including unreleased (in this form) numbers such as Get Thy Bearings, Drop In, Mantra and Travel Weary Capricorn, the level of musicianship is a revelation. There is a lot more soloing on these cuts than on the album versions, especially by the absurdly talented Ian McDonald.Guitar God Robert Fripp has also put together an absolutely superb and very substantial booklet, which is packed with information, insights, rare photos and press clippings and recent (1996/7) interviews with all five band members.King Crimson were one of the most original bands in music history and this double set captures the elemental genius that was the combination of five remarkable people coming together and just getting everything right, first time. Peter Sinfield's unique and exquisite lyrics were a huge part of the magic that was King Crimson, and the classic Crimson King cover by Pete's friend, the late Barry Godber, completed the spell.Epitaph is a beautifully produced boxed set, which features the haunting cover painting, The Four Seasons, by P.J. Crook, which is somewhat reminiscent of the style of Paul Whitehead, who did some of the early Genesis covers.Exceptional value.

Step right up for the Unholy Grail of Moorcockian Metal Mayhem. Nice to see Michael's modern gothic masterpiece on an expanded CD - and at such a ludicrous price. Thanks, Amazon.This is a timeless album, and a tribute to Moorcock's musical as well as literary genius. The haunting Circus of Death feel that permeates the album brilliantly captures the simmering desperation of the occupants of yet another artificially sustained environment - The New World's Fair. While the punters party like it's way beyond 1999, their Masque Of The Red Death style celebration is doomed by another metaphorical plague - the spectre of nuclear, chemical and biological annihilation. The inevitable legacy of a soulless totalitarian psytocracy.Backed by an awesome array of musicians, including members of Hawkwind and High Tide, MM proves over and over again that Deep Fixx - the Art band who imitated Life - are a force to be reckoned with.As one might expect from the Master, this is truly a white knuckle ride to the Gates of Oblivion.

While my copy is on the way, I have read enough excerpts to require extensive sedation. Yes, I'm a Believer friends, and I have hairs on my palms to prove it.This is the book that those gutless, cyborg-like imbeciles Strunk and White would have written if they had possessed one iota of talent. In another life, boys. And your mother, too.My eternal thanks to SF author and co-conspirator Victoria Strauss (The Burning Land etc.) - if that IS her real name - for pointing me at this meisterwerk par excellence. A day that will live in Infamy... (ellipsis = dot dot dot)I would strongly suggest that asthmatics give this a miss, and that spouses of asthmatics who ignore this suggestion, should up their partner's Life insurance by a quantum factor. In fact, a lot.Out, out, damned candle! Just waxing filo pastry, there.This wonderfully wily worldly wizard wheeze is an artistically anachronistic antediluvian asymmetrical apocalyptica-addled abomination of almost anti-Aristotlean abhorrent alternative alliteration... already... aaaaaah that's better.Okay, I'll Go Linear...

Even by David's standards, this was a truly classic album.While Station To Station was a move in a Dance direction on the heels of Young Americans, it was also a solid Rock album, which features a superb rhythm section, driven by the exceptional guitar work of Earl Slick (Carlos Alomar on rhythm) and which yielded all time classics such as the title track, the incomparable Stay and David's vocal showcase, Wild Is The Wind.There are many truly essential Bowie albums, and this is one of the pivotal ones, along with Let's Dance. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Like our Army Vet reviewer bud, I have found that I can track many of my major Life events by a given David album. This man wrote the soundtrack of our lives, as he has continued to do on the stunning Reality album.A landmark album, for David and for modern music.

Having now obtained the full, combined version of RE (previously I had only read Volume 1), I must revisit this review. Volume 2, which is now the second part of the combined volume, is a fascinating record of Helen's regression sessions, conducted by the excellent Dr. June Steiner. The full book, at almost 400 pages, is a very powerful addition to the ever-increasing volume of credible Alien Abduction/Hybridization data.I have had the pleasure of communicating with the superb Dave Jacobs (The Threat) and as a result of his and the late John Mack's work on the Alien Abduction phenomenon, I feel there is enough data out there to refute the standard skeptic's notion that the entire subject is fanciful.As Fox Mulder once said on the X-Files (and I'm paraphrasing), if you say you've seen a UFO or been Abducted by Aliens, people are ready to commit you. If you say you've seen the Virgin Mary, they'll build a shrine outside your house.Top 20 Reviewer Dennis Littrell's idea that people can sometimes fall into these belief systems as an escape mechanism is very sound, but I feel that the desire to be 'more than human' is also a harmonic of the innate knowledge that we actually are more than human. As many New Age psychologists and philosophers have said, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.My own past life regression (go on, get the net) included a chain of linked death-in-combat recalls, the earliest of which was 10 million years ago in another galaxy. So to me, there is nothing remotely fanciful or inconceivable about this rather interesting story. Like Dennis, I also love the spelling of Raechel, which coupled with the spooky cover (by Noah J. Crissey), adds to the mystique.Having had many regression sessions, much of which was past life regression, I feel Helen's sessions are the icing on the cake, in the wake of Part I of the book. They seem 100% legit, and Dr. Steiner obviously knows her stuff. The session data should leave the reader in no doubt about the validity of Helen's experiences and the accuracy and truth of the story of Marisa and Raechel.I cannot think of another book that openly approaches the idea of direct and extended close contact with an Alien-Human hybrid, even though we have known of the existence of the program - via impeccable sources such as Dr. David Jacobs and John Mack etc. for years. This is a classic work on that basis alone.Helen's book is a very worthwhile addition to the ever-increasing volume of what my psychologist friend Jerry describes as 'disturbing evidence of something that the blinkered skeptics will one day have to confront directly'.Bring it on.

Certainly one of Bolen's most essential works. Ring Of Power provides a valuable guide to Wagner's classic Ring Cycle, yet it is Bolen's grasp of the archetypal basis for the mythology that gives the book its power.All creation comes from an archetypal base, and in The Ring, it is the symbolic sacrificing of the Sacred Feminine that drives the entire story. This principle is fundamental to many pieces, including Faust, the Grail legends and even Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.In each case, only the restoration of that which has been sacrificed in a Faustian pact can make healing occur. Bolen's genius is never clearer than in this book, and it was pivotal to the concluding sections of my own book, Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine.I would strongly recommend Ring Of Power, and indeed all of Bolen's works - especially her autobiographical Crossing To Avalon. People who doubt the importance of Thinking Person's Feminism might consider this... 84 years ago Jean Shinoda Bolen would not have been able to vote, own her own house or inherit property from her father. Like every other woman in the highly civilized English-speaking world.My own book is dedicated to the nine million women who were murdered by the Church during the Inquisition, for such heinous crimes as being midwives and healers. Lest we forget. If the patriarchal Valhalla is now burning, all I can say is pass the gasoline. Good job, Jean.

While I accept that there may be flaws in some of Temple's basic assertions, and that earlier cultural contamination may have sown the seed of the Dogon &quot;binary&quot; mythology, the book is still a fascinating read.Even if the Dogon had been contacted by Westerners before the original reports of their &quot;Sirius binary&quot; theory were made, it is an odd piece of data for them to discuss, let alone latch onto and distort into a tribal mythology. The suggestion that some of the modern Dogon are not aware of this Alien/Sirius legend does not automatically mean that the Dogon at the time of the first interview could not have relayed the story as Temple portrays it. There may be many reasons why the tribal teachings may have subsequently suppressed this information. Possible flaws or not, nobody can conclusively disprove Temple's basic theories, so the book is likely to endure.For example, I could suggest that J.M. Barrie used the concept of Sirius being a binary star in his directions to Never Land in Peter Pan (second star to the right and straight on till morning). Pan was written before the confirmation of the reality of the twin star system, yet the idea of such an important star being a binary could easily have come to Barrie in a moment of inspiration. Again, nobody could disprove the idea, especially as the worlds of the Spirit and Quantum Reality Theory are moving ever closer together.Temple's original suggestion that Sirius, the Star of Isis in Templar and masonic legend, may also in fact be a triple star system, including a Sirius C, now seems to be in the process of being confirmed, astronomically. This adds even more weight to his arguments.I'm sure Temple's book will be debated for decades to come, but whatever is the case, it remains an important study and a highly entertaining read.Regarding the later NASA photographs of the Face at Cydonia, which supposedly disprove the existence of a Sphinx-like &quot;face&quot;, I personally think they reek of digital manipulation and are about as convincing as the US Government's Roswell denials.Humans... Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em...

Yes, I'm a Kevin fan and yes, I think this is an exceptional movie, and it is refreshing to see so many other fans saying so.The media tend to build people up in order to knock them down, and like David Bowie, Kevin has incurred their wrath entirely because of the extent of his genius. His performances in JFK and Dances were as good as it gets, and to me, he lends the same quality to his performance in The Postman. If anything, it is understated, and that may have been part of the problem for the pre-biased critics, who descended like pack animals when the movie came out.I totally agree that in the wake of 911 the movie has infinitely more significance, and now that patriotism isn't such a dirty word, except in Trendy Lefty circles, this is a movie that is worth seeing or re-visiting for any viewers who were wavering because of the infantile Bashing campaign that dogged its release and distribution.The guy's brilliant, deal with it.

Well, not necessarily better, but this Grammy-winning album does have some outstanding tracks.Bono's tribute to his late father Bob, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, took an award in itself, although Miracle Drug is probably my favorite in this excellent set.It ain't perfect though, and this is a more patchy album than their masterwork The Joshua Tree, but when they shine, they shine, and the good tracks are as good as anything that has gone before.Every generation has its Supergroup. First it was The Beatles, then it was Led Zeppelin, now we have U2. Let's hope the boys stick together for a long time to come, because they've still got what it takes.

... than have done what we're about to do... I may be slightly paraphrasing, but those were the words of a B-2 Spirit Stealth bomber pilot as he spoke to the President from the skies above Iraq.This is a very well-conceived movie and the superb Kevin Pollak was a great choice as the Pres. If I have a criticism at all, it is that the movie suggests that the reason the US could not engage the invading Iraqi army is that most of their troops were positioned to deal with North Korea at that time.This is unlikely, as the Korean situation is very simple, in that there is an infinitely greater chance that the US would use Tac Nukes against any invading force as a first resort. If North Korea ever began a barrage of the South Korean capital (a city of 10 million people), they would be able to effectively destroy it with conventional rockets and shells during the first 24-48 hours, causing millions of casualties.There is no doubt in the minds of any military analysts that the US would have to go nuclear and on a massive scale well within the first two hours. While the North Korean capital would almost certainly receive a 'deterrence'-style surrender or die message from the US, the main thrust would be the large scale use of heavy tactical and even strategic nuclear weapons against the launch areas for the rocket tubes etc., many of which have been embedded to make them difficult to bomb. Neutron weapons would be one of the most effective responses for this type of target.Not a pleasant topic and one that we all hope will remain in the realms of the theoretical, but then again, that's up to the North Korean leader.Deterrence captures the life or death nature of this kind of diplomacy and is an important reminder of the stakes involved.The only other criticism is that (Don't read on if you don't want to know anything about the film, I'm about to mention a plot event...) when the diner owner shoots and wounds the military aide carrying the briefcase containing the launch codes, there is NO WAY the Security people would stand there, pointing their guns at him trying to talk him down and risk that he will fire a fatal shot, thus making it impossible to open the briefcase. The guy would have been tomato paste after getting off the first round.All in all a great movie. Essential viewing for dictators everywhere.

Bob Mason has written a stunning book about ordinary people caught up in the eternal madness of War. It could be any war, but Bob's war was Vietnam.Chickenhawk puts you right there in the cockpit of a Huey Slick (the Slicks were the troop carriers, rather than having a Gunship or Medevac/Dustoff role) as Bob takes you into endless near-impossible hot LZ operations to deploy, extract and supply/re-supply the kids who were in the front lines of a war that should never have happened.His technical descriptions of the extreme combat flying techniques that he had to employ in order to survive under heavy fire, are exceptional. Yet the heart of the book lies not in his haunting yet beautifully described combat scenarios, but in his humanity and ruthless honesty and soul searching, as he tries to come to terms with what the war did to him as a human being.Bob is a living testimony to the truth that PTSD is a normal reaction to an insane situation, and the fact the Nam Vets who suffer from PTSD are not the ones who are crazy. The dishonest war mongers whose machinations denied Ho Chi Minh his chance to rule a united Vietnam via free elections, are the ones who are insane, and the ones who should single-handedly carry the Guilt that the war generated among so many who were caught up in it.Welcome home, soldier.

One of the cornerstones of Glass's approach to music is his inventive use of layered repetition, whether it be in a breathtaking opera such as Akhnaten or in this beautiful solo piano collection.The use of calculated repetition has been around for a long time.Avant Garde composer Erik Satie's Vexations was only 180 notes long, yet Satie directed it to be repeated 840 times. The first recording of it was organized by John Cage in 1963 in New York, and it was performed by a relay team of 10 pianists over a period of 18 hours. This is an extreme example of repetition, but the same end product, a transcendental shift, is a key point of Glass's own approach.There is nothing hierarchical about approaching Glass. You either get him or you don't.

While Beekeeper lacks some of the majesty of Scarlet's Walk, which contained such breathtaking classics as I Can't See New York, it is still a powerful collection of songs, and one that showcases Tori's diversity.I have too many favorite tracks to list them, which is clearly a good sign, and I find this loosely-threaded concept album to be one of Tori's most cohesive tributes to the divine Feminine and the timeless mystique of female sexuality.Beautiful album, fascinating woman.

The overall presentation is good and there is a great deal of useful vocabulary in here. My one beef is that the entire workbook is in German, with absolutely NO translation, explanation or introduction and the video cassette has absolutely no details on the plain white cover.Without a dictionary, you cannot possibly make any real use of this package, even though the quality of the mime is good enough to convey the basic drift of each lesson. As for "Peter", any guys left questioning their sexuality should note that "he" is played by Eve-Marie Forcier.There DEFINITELY should have been an English translation and some kind of rudimentary introduction in English.

Whether academics would consider this a literary masterpiece or not, Tim's honesty and integrity make this a must-read account of his total Vietnam experience. I say total, because I found his description of his almost-AWOL phase to be one of the most fascinating parts of the book.Morally and practically, his situation was infinitely more complex than that of a draft dodger, for whom there were known routes into Canada above all, and more clear cut decison processes involved. About 90,000 of the 100,000 draft dodgers fled to Canada, many of whom settled here long-term.Yet as you read Tim's account of his guided tour of hell, you realize that, like all Vietnam Vets, and I have the honor of knowing many of both genders, his healing journey is one that he will not be undertaking alone. Sadly, there was nothing unique about his Vietnam experience, as he would be the first to tell you.At one point, back in the late seventies, there was a statistic indicating that about 800,000 Vietnam Vets - about half the combat vets, were suffering from PTSD. Yet it became obvious that this figure, which did not even include the Army nurses and Docs who sewed everybody back together, was somewhat low. On reading If I Die, you can see how the Vietnam experience could stay with a person for the rest of his/her life, especially in view of the hostility that the Vets faced upon their return to 'The World'.Vietnam was a tremendously divisive issue and the factors that Tim O'Brien had to balance during his almost-AWOL period, make you realize that the actual draft dodgers will also have their own healing to do. The only draft dodgers I have a problem with are the ones who fled to Canada, yet who claim to have done so because of their 'principles'.No. The draft evaders with true integrity and principles either took the courageous step of joining the military as a Medic and refused to carry weapons, or like David Harris, Joan Baez's husband, went to jail for their principles - David was jailed for 3 years for Draft Evasion. The dodgers who ran to Canada did so because they were scared, pure and simple, and there is nothing wrong with being scared. Just don't lie about it - or you will never heal.As for 'principles', if 100,000 people had forced the Government to jail them over the Vietnam issue, as David did, it might have made a difference. It might literally have ended the war years earlier, and saved young men like Tim from having to undergo such a psychologically damaging experience. Running away was a selfish act, but one which I do not judge - that is between them and God. Just don't try to sell me 'principles', boys. Ever.Tim O'Brien is a great writer, and in If I Die, he really puts you in harm's way, among the trip-wire grenades, the panji stake pits, the minefields and the VC snipers. Yet hard as the Vietnam War was on the young draftees, the unforgivable thing is the fact that for many of these teenage soldiers, the hardest part was coming home. To quote from Paul Hardcastle's '19' (the average age of the combat soldier in Vietnam) &quot;They fought the longest war in American history... None of them received a hero's welcome...&quot;Welcome home, Tim.

I'll admit it, I've been a Jon Hiseman fan all along, not just for his superb musicianship and writing/producing ability, but for his ability to bring out the best in those around him.For me, this is some of Allan's finest and most exciting guitar work, even though he has played some breathtaking solos in his time - e.g. Hazard Profile (Soft Machine). Tight, inventive solos that fit perfectly into this Metal-tinged Heavy Prog Rock classic. While I love all the tracks, I have special affection for Foyers Of Fun, having spent a week learning the solo for a Hiseman tribute bash many years ago, only to have our band's spot dropped at the last moment. I coulda been a contender...The follow-up album, Living In Fear, with Ollie Halsall (ex-Patto) on guitar was also excellent, but for me, Tempest remains one of Jon's most powerful musical statements and a landmark album in modern Rock.For info about Jon and his impossibly beautiful wife, sax goddess Barbara Thompson, check out their Temple Music web site, which also features their daughter Ana Gracey, who is a major talent in her own right. Yeah, she's got their genes in every way...

For me, this is her most satisfying album since the mighty Broken English. I guess being a Nick and Polly Jean fan, I am somewhat biased in rating the music, but this really is a great album.Every track has something distinctive, from the Cirkus of Death feel in City of Quartz, the closing number, to gothic ballads such as There Is A Ghost and the punchy My Friends Have; and the minimalist style is a breath of fresh air in an age of over-production.The striking cover photo presumably contrasts the innocence of youth as symbolized by the young girl lying aross Marianne's lap with the spiritual attrition that results from Life, age and experience.Brilliant.

I winced when I heard that they were re-making the excellent Stepford Wives but going for laughs. Not that it would have been impossible to pull that off, but I had a feeling that the result could be something like this.The cutting social commentary that worked so well in the original movie (released in a different time period) is just lost here, mainly due to the naive and predictable screenplay. The idea of these Perfect Couples living in a bleak, Martha Stewart/Betty Crocker techno wasteland could have been the basis for a highly entertaining movie, and there are flashes of that here and there, but on the whole, this juggernaut just falls flat.One of the few updates that make some kind of sense is the way that the Masculine/Butch member of the gay couple is completely accepted by the other 'husbands' - the whole thing being based on role playing.This is an amazing cast, but they are so under-utilized that it is positively sad. John Lovitz absolutely shines with the few lines and situations he is given, but what a waste of a superb actor. Ditto for most of the cast.It's not unwatchable by any means, but it was certainly a great disappointment, and for me, the fault lies squarely with the script itself.

This is a stunning DVD and excellent value for money, given the number of songs plus the extras, which include the breathtaking Sleeping Sun video.However, I agree with other fans that there are times when the audio track seems to be out of synch with the vocals above all. I tend to think that this is a technical problem rather than a miming issue, as a classically trained goddess such as Tarja would never need to fake her awesome vocals.While various people have combined Trance and opera very effectively in the past, Nightwish are one of the few Gothic Metal bands who also have this amazing combination, and to have such a beautiful woman out front, just adds to the magic that this immensely talented band have to offer.Because of the age of this DVD, it doesn't have some of my favorite tracks such as The Siren, but the track selection, which includes such classics as Kinslayer, is excellent. The atmosphere at the concert is superb, and every time the camera cuts randomly to a section of the audience, there is a sea of outstretched arms and pointing index fingers of fans who are singing along word for word.Great value.

As you may know, Clifford T. Ward left us in 2001 after a 20 year battle with MS. Sad though this was, we are lucky to have been left with so many haunting songs.While the entire album is brilliant and a real showcase for his genius, tracks such as Gaye, Nightingale and Homethoughts From Abroad really undersore the fact that this man was literally second to none. This is as good as it gets, and his music holds its own against against any classics you could name.I always remember the line from Blade Runner where Eldon Tyrell, the designer of the Nexus-6 Replicants tells the android combat leader, &quot;The light that burns half as long burns twice as brightly...&quot; Well you burned so very brightly, Clifford. Thank you for everything.

Not only one of Michael's finest moments, but quite simply a landmark in Science Fiction/Fantasy. I am not in any way exaggerating when I say that I had an out-of-body experience upon finishing The End Of All Songs (Book 3) - such is the level of transcendence that this epic work generates.The implications of Dancers are so vast and numerous that it makes your head spin, but even as a fairly linear allegory, it is right on the button. The main characters live in a far future world, where the level of technology borders on magic, allowing them to create virtually any reality with their power rings.Yet the technology is the product of earlier generations, of whom the remaining race are mostly unaware - recalling Prospero's line to Miranda (from The Tempest) &quot;Canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell?&quot; Big Mike likens these artificially sustained beings to a collection of hothouse flowers, which are kept alive by &quot;an alien heat&quot; (Wratislaw?)The parallels with Earth Now and the direction in which post Industrial Revolution humanity has been heading are chilling, however humorously expressed. High entropy, energy-wasting civilizations have become so disconnected from the Earth Mother that it may only be a matter of time before some T2-style AI-triggered GigaDeath apocalypse sweeps the board clean.In his Moorcockian epic Finnegans Wake, James Joyce used paradoxically structured anarchic language in an attempt to overload the reader's dominant Left Brain and trigger Transcendence. Moorcock manages to achieve the same Above Time perspective by infinitely more conventional means, yet the effect is the same. Union. Oneness. Return.If this breathtakingly beautiful classic doesn't blow your mind, check your pulse... maybe you're already dead.Utterly majestic.

...9/11 was the greatest Deception ever carried out by the US Govt. and its many-tentacled security services.I came to this DVD after watching the controversial DVD Loose Change, and having seen both, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that 9/11 was a carefully orchestrated attack on the American people, by its own leaders.One quick tip of the hat to Jim McBain... It's true, the very obsessive secrecy and the we're-above-the-Law behavior of the security services, and the dehumanizing way they treat the taxpayers who pay their wages, tends to create a climate for Conspiracy Theory, even without examining the details.The focus on the Pentagon '757 crash' is based largely on the tiny initial 12/16-foot impact zone, the total absence of any credible wreckage, and the apparent presence of an engine from a military A-3 jet, rather than the large, twin Rolls Royce 757 engines which should have survived a crash of any type, and temperatures of virtually any magnitude.If the wreckage really was there, and there really was a 75ft impact zone, wouldn't it have been helpful to explain things at the time? Likewise with Flight 93... As for those 'eye witnesses' who claim to have seen an airliner rather than 'something else'... one guy didn't just see an airliner, he saw a 757 and added, just so we didn't have any doubts, y'all, "American Airlines"Yeah...Re: the Twin Towers, given the firefighters' 9/11 communications and subsequent interviews alone, we see a very clear picture of an exaggerated Government scenario of the 'inferno' on the upper floors - contradicted by Fire Chief Palmer's on-the-spot technical assessment from the 78th Floor - in which he considered that the fire could be put out 'with two lines'. If that floor was manageable, maybe the inferno wasn't quite all we have been led to believe.Having now had some time to process the information, I still find myself agreeing with other reviewers, that this may have been a black ops action, and that the real-time command and control used prior to and after the buildings were hit by unmanned, drone aircraft, (rather than 'real hijacked airliners') was so sophisticated that the carefully positioned charges brought the buildings down in a textbook controlled demolition fashion, a full 24 hours before a 'real collapse' due to fire damage would even have been a remote possibility.The Twin Towers were 'over-engineered' to the extent that they were designed to comfortably and safely withstand a direct hit by a Boeing 707, and while a 757 is bigger and carries more fuel, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that the buldings would have collapsed AT ANY POINT, even given a hit by a larger aircraft - let alone that they would collapse so relatively rapidly. Nothing about the rapid and total collapse makes any sense whatsoever.If the Conspiracy theorists are correct, this was wholesale murder, and it seems quite likley that the twofold objective was financial gain - insurance, stocks and shares etc., and a justification for The Patriot Act, after which Bush had carte blanche 'to insidiously subvert the very democracy that he claims to be trying to protect'. Going after terrorists is one thing, but the extra powers are clearly being used in a broader arc. Besides, the security services still don't seem to know exactly who all of the hijackers were - as a number of the ones identified are provably still alive.As Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister said, "The bigger the lie, the more they believe it."The nonsensical explanation of Flight 93 being vaporized during the crash, and the Pentagon plane meeting a similar fate, are perhaps the most outrageous aspects of the whole 9/11 'big lie'. Planes that size just don't get vaporized during crashes. Ever.Please watch In Plane Site, and watch Loose Change (they make a mistake about a B-52 crashing into the Empire State Building - it was actually a B-25, but it's still excellent) and make up your own mind.As I said, if even ten percent of this is true, 9/11 was the biggest outrage ever inflicted on the American people.

...was so much owed by so many to so few.The words were spoken by Winston Churchill while expressing the debt his country owed to the RAF fighter pilots who inflicted Hitler's first defeat in 1940 during The Battle of Britain.The same words could be used to describe the debt owed to the military nurses and their Red Cross sisters who flew 12,000 miles into a war zone to care for the wounded and the dying from a largely conscript army whose average age was 19 (in WW II it was 26.)I have only ever known of three Army Nurses who served a second Tour in Vietnam. Dusty, aka Dana Shuster, Diana Dwan Poole, and Captain Mary 'Chris' Banigan, who sadly passed away earlier this year. Ask any Nam Nurse who served even one Tour what it must have taken to go back a second time and they will shake their heads. Yet Dana Shuster did go back.Dana takes you behind the ranks of bungling self-serving politicians, the failed or absent strategies, to show you the human cost of a war that made no sense to the people fighting it, even as it was happening.As Country Joe rightly said, Hello David is a classic by anybody's standards, and remains one of the most stark, chilling snapshots of the daily quota of heartbreak that the Nam Nurses had to endure every 72-hour working week. As Dana asks, who will give her something for her pain?Yet Dusty also captures what was perhaps the most unforgivable aspect of the Vietnam War - the blaming of the troops, (who were routinely called 'baby killers' on their return to the US) and the Nurses, Red Cross workers and WACs who risked their own lives to support them.Yet even when she writes about being pelted with beer cans, her transcendent sense of humor brings her to reflect on the philosophical question of whether the beer cans were half-empty or half-full.I was lucky enough to obtain a signed copy of Battle Dressing, which Dusty signed 'Blessings and peace'. Right back at you, Dana.Welcome home, ANC.

This is an extremely well-researched book, and despite its tendency to drag during the endless behind-the-scenes politicking, it gives the reader an invaluable overview of the whole case.At the time of writing, a former school teacher, John Mark Karr, has just been arrested in Thailand in connection with the case, and in view of his apparent confession, this seems to support the previously-doubted Intruder Theory.Update: Karr was cleared of any involvement with the case, and while the limited 10-loci 'case DNA' is incomplete, it was enough to eliminate him, as some of his 10 sequencing markers did not match the 10 in the sample array. Basically, he was a nut job, and there is now controversy surrounding Michael Tracey, the man who tipped the police off about Karr as a possible suspect, and his possible involvement with investigator Lou Smit.In terms of the media, the Ramseys (Patsy is now dead) were their own worst enemies. To me, they not only came across as being weird, but arrogant, also. Hardly how you would expect people to react when they have presumably been devastated by such loss. Scott Peterson had the same callous persona, prior to his conviction.Even if they were totally innocent, their bizarre obstructive behavior, especially towards the police investigation, made them suspects from the word go.Schiller brilliantly captures the Keystone Cops fiasco that was the police investigation, and raises many valid points about the handling of the case and the reasons for suspecting or not suspecting that it was a family affair.One of the most questionable aspects of this case was the writing of a two and a half page ransome note by 'the killer' on a pad in the house itself. Even the idea that a killer could be so detatched or insane as to hang around to write the by-definition redundant note is enough to ring alarm bells.JonBenet had been publicly hypersexualized all of her young life, and put out there by an overbearing, manipulative mother and an oafish father; yet despite her looks and her manufactured child sexuality, there was no irrefutable evidence that she had been sexually assaulted, despite the coroner's virtual speculation. That alone, ironically, was unusual, given how many cases involving child murder also involve sexual assault.Could the ten year-old brother have dealt the savage blow that killed her? Yes. So could either of the parents.The strangling/garotting may have even been an afterthought, as the forensic evidence suggested that the blow had been a fatal one.After reading this and other books, I long suspected that she had either been killed by a family member, or that her family had some involvement at the very least. Even after all this time, there is no convincing evidence of an intruder. None. All of the possible pieces of 'evidence' have now been debunked.It is inconceivable that an intruder could have snuck into the house, leaving no entry/exit signs (there was heavy snow on the ground outside - there were no footprints, and the one Hi Tec 'suspected' print has been debunked) and had such lengthy and close contact with the girl and not leave any clear DNA samples behind. To do that, he would have to have been wearing a space suit.The Ramseys used lawyers to insulate themselves from the very investigation that as 'grieving parents' they should have been bending over backwards to cooperate with.In my opinion, the Ramseys were guilty of the involuntary manslaughter of JonBenet, and of orchestrating an illogical and fully transparent cover up. I believe that people like Ramsey lawyer Lin Wood and investigator Lou Smit have acted unethically, and with great arrogance have tried to perpetuate the myth of the Ramseys' innocence; and in doing so, have contributed to a gross perversion of the course of justice. To me, it is only the unimaginable incompetence of the Boulder DA that has allowed this fiasco to go on as long as it has.May the child find peace.

I confess I was drawn to this book by the title alone, and the very concept of the Mermaid Chair and its associated mythology was a tremendously powerful story element.Alas, the novel never really seems to capitalize on the enormous potential of the transformational metaphors that one associates with mermaids/sirens and the function of the chair/throne in its own right.It is almost as though Sue came up with a truly inspired basic story engine and then bolted on a slightly above average romance story that isn't particularly riveting or heavy on the tension/challenge etc.There is a lot of symbolism throughout the novel, including the use of islands to suggest alienation; the sea as a metaphor for Consciousness; the contrasting Dionysian versus Apollonian energies of the two main men in her life; and in the mythological parallels between her mother chopping off her finger and the ancient mermaid's severed fingers forming the first sea creatures, but even though the magical undercurrents are there, I didn't feel that the novel's potential had been anything like fully tapped.I definitely think it's 'worth a read', but I'd wait for the paperback, too.

...they get five deferments when their Country asks them to serve. Like Dick Cheney.I only read this rather average autobiography after I read a snarky letter from the father of an Iraq Marine in which he called Murtha a coward, and claimed that he was not a Marine, that he was 'nothing' - because of Murtha's call for a specific withdrawal calendar for Iraq.I don't care if people criticize his wording or even his intelligence, but to call a man a coward because you disagree with his stance is beyond pathetic.We know that the VC/NVA leaders were encouraged by the actions of the Peace Movement back in Nam days, and I understand people bristling over the modern equivalent regarding Iraq, but to ignore the fact that this Administration has been sending under-protected, inadequately trained and supported units out to Iraq while simultaneously cutting key military funding and reducing Veterans' benefits is a scandal in itself.Bush and Cheney rely on Knee Jerk Patriotism and pitting Vet against Vet, while the most famous chickenhawk duo in history continue to work with smoke and mirrors.No, I am not a Democrat. Reagan and Thatcher were the best thing to ever happen to the Free World.I'm giving this five stars, because his voluntary Nam service is worth ten stars alone. The rest didn't exactly hold my attention quite frankly, but few things do.Welcome home, Marine.

Having read a lot of hostile reactions to this book, both in the Press and all over the Net, it seems the main knee jerk reaction has been to trash anything that may paint the Nazis in any kind of 'good light'. While I can understand that, I feel it gets in the way of a 'normal' reaction to the contents of the book. I shall hereafter refer to German rather than Nazi entities for that reason.Basically, to infer that all Germans are/were Nazis is as distasteful and unreasonable as describing all Israelis as Zionists. Some are, most are not. The Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was a hardcore terrorist who even murdered British troops during WW II, while seeking an arms deal with Mussolini, so let's not get too high and mighty here.No, there is no conclusive proof about the existence of a secret German UFO or anti-gravity research progam. That does not mean that it therefore did not exist, merely that anybody suggesting that it did, is on thin ice. The closest thing to a German UFO that we have actual evidence of was the Horten disc-shaped glider and later powered glider, and various related projects.Even the UFO community are deeply divided about the German UFO concept as some feel that it suggests that all UFO activity derives from German UFO technology, which is simply ridiculous. Far too many of the confirmed UFO sightings involve characteristics that make a terrestrial explanation ludicrous.Nick Cook has written a brave book, and in his overall belief that the US has been intensively and secretly researching anti-grav technology, he joins other very credible researchers including former NASA consultant Richard Hoagland, who have offered examples of suppressed experimental results.As for suppression... When two scientists claimed to have produced cold fusion in the lab, the Government's vested interest groups basically lined up a large body of detractors to 'prove' that they were wrong. In recent years, other groups of scientists have actually reproduced the original claimed results, and after almost 15 years of lost time i.e. deliberately wasted time - the idea is now being re-examined.While Cook does not succeed in making a truly convincing case for German UFO research, he is still right to question the suppression of over unity energy research; and anti-gravity tech is only part of what might broadly be termed Unified Field Theory.The trouble is, given the power of the vested interest groups who are basically running a planet whereby predicted profits are based on the continuation of archaic engines and propulsion systems that are designed to keep guzzling fossil fuels in whatever form for another century or two, we ain't likely to see free energy any time soon. Even if the possibility exists... of course. This isn't a planet... it's a business enterprise.Like various conspiracy theorists have said, if you were making 100 billion dollars a year by pretending you can't cure cancer, would you give that up overnight?Worth a read, but it is unlikely to convince people who are aleady polarized by various factors - like the rest of the human race

An often ignored work of genius from the Master. Bradbury's Neo-Pagan/Quantum Reality view of the universe is presented here in a truly spellbinding allegory.However one interprets the metaphorical journeys and the symbols of eternal recurrence, you cannot fail to be impressed by the man's vision and passion for Life and Truth.While briefly flying through the equivalents of Halloween in different cultures, Bradbury also subtly honours the millions who were slaughtered under the tyranny of the Old Church during the Inquisition. As he clearly shows, our only real enemy is bigotry and superstition.This wonderful book can be a learning experience for adults and children alike and is certainly one of RB's most original and exciting pieces. A modern classic.

...could be given such a beautiful planet, populated by such divine creatures as Sheila Chandra, Susheela Raman, Eleftheria Arvanitaki and Estrella Morente from such rich and diverse cultural backrgounds... yet spend all their time trashing the environment and fighting war after pointless war.This is a wonderful album and a joy to behold. I originally bought it for Sheila's stunnning version of the haunting Tim Buckley song, Song To The Siren, which I also have by This Mortal Coil (Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals).Yet having played the album through I was blown away to discover that there were literally no filler tracks. This is a wonderful collection of songs which includes some enchanting pieces by Yungchen Lhamo, which are simply intriguing.Highly recommended.

I agree with the other reviewers on the excellence of the Snowman, and while it is grossly inferior, Father Christmas is still a nice feature to have in this double package.I too had consistency problems with the DVD. Sometimes it loads fine and you see the true Root Menu, showing both story options, others it just displays Father Christmas. When this happens, I find that by re-inserting the DVD, the problem usually goes away.Definitely a quality conrol issue here.

Sorry, but I had to get that out of the way.I have been a total Julianne/All About Eve fan from the beginning and this stunning mini album is yet another showcase for her exquisite vocals.From the beautiful opening song If Life Were A Movie onwards, we are treated to J's gorgeous vocals over a well-chosen dance beat, and the effect is hypnotic. I had no idea that Jules et Jim was this kind of music, but the pair of them have done an incredible job, and I absolutely love it.This woman should be a star.

It is almost inconceivable that one person could have crafted this work of genius, yet Stanshall did. Rawlinson is one of the few recorded pieces in which virtually every line is indispensible. Even Sir Henry's throw away expressions such as &quot;Filth Hounds of Hades&quot;, &quot;God's teeth and trousers&quot; and &quot;God's turban and tutu&quot; carry with them all the weight of the hekau or Power Words of the ancient cultures.I had the good fortune to catch the Bonzos farewell tour, and even for a battle-hardened Bonzo Dog nut such as myself, Rawlinson was a revelation. The richness and uniqueness of the many colourful characters gives tremendous depth to this hilarious creation from the mind of the late and truly great Viv Stanshall.No review, however detailed, could possibly do justice to this complex masterpiece, although George Thomas Parsons came dang close. I shall merely humbly beseech you to buy it on trust. One word of caution, however... If you are an asthmatic, you MUST have a Salbutamol inhaler at the ready!Blast this leg, by cracky...

Oh, that's right, you're dead now, aren't you?Here, untainted by the interference of her unworthy ex, Ted Hughes, is an intense and revealing series of insights into the mind of this most brilliant woman.I came to these journals after reading five volumes of the diaries of Virginia Woolf, and some of the parallels are quite chilling.Whether Plath articulates it or not, the legacy of the Inquisition hangs over her as it has over so many women who are still trying to make sense of a world that is yet to be cleansed of the darker residues of patriarchy.At the time of her suicide in 1963, women had only had been able to vote, own property and inherit property from their fathers for a pitiful 45 years. Incredibly, the centennial of women suffrage will not be until 2018. But of course, that can't be an issue, can it?As for people who desperately manipulate threads of her words to 'prove' that she secretly wanted dependence, hinting that all women secretly crave dependence; consider that if women were naturally dependent on men, the patriarchy would never have needed to set up such a vast number of mechanisms to suppress them.Having read most of her poetry, including the final Ariel poems, and having worked through the journals - a draining experience at times - I still feel Plath's basic Life dilemma is captured in the following hybridized stanza (a merging of lines from two separate stanzas) from Lorelei:-Worse even than your maddeningSong, your silence. At the sourceOf your ice-hearted calling...The siren's wail is something primal, something heart-stoppingly elemental. The carrier wave for the Great Song, the Oran Mor of the Celts. It even appears in a similar form in Siddhartha, in the river of a thousand voices, ultimately all converging to form Unity.Like any tortured soul, such as Virginia Woolf - plug in a name - the basic alienation and fear of meaninglessness clearly were there in Plath as with most humans, but her Lorelei references also suggested a fear of her own innate primal power. She had a glimpse of something that simply overloaded her circuits, perhaps like the Kundalini experience that led to the poet Shelley's drowning.Yes, there in those lines, we have the dilemma. Which is the more terrible, the Silence or the Song? The fear of nothingness or the crushing tidal wave of everydayness? The entire process of Life. She lived vicariously to some degree, placing far too much importance on her relationship with Ted Hughes. A roving, cheating husband, a man without honor, who was simply not worthy of her, or of any decent woman.Perhaps in her final bleak despair, she forgot that she had existed before him as Sylvia Plath and could have existed after him as Sylvia Plath. She misinterpreted the siren call of her Sisters. They were not calling her down to Death, but to reunification. Ted who? I rather fancy she was the better poet of the two, by a long sea mile.

Steve Thomas is a man of great courage and integrity, who has rightly stuck to his guns, claiming that the Ramseys and most likely Patsy, were responsible for the death of JonBenet Ramsey.Despite the crude empty blustering of Ramsey lawyer Lin Wood, the case simply comes down to this... there has never ever been ANY conclusive evidence of an intruder. Everything that the Ramsey supporters keep pointing to has already been debunked.Even if the killer had somehow teleported in and out of the house, thus eliminating signs of entry/exit, there is no way they could have had such close and prolonged physical contact with the girl without leaving a credible evidential DNA sample.Despite the pathetic attempts to claim that the tainted partial DNA sample that the DA have been sitting on may have been from the intruder, there is no evidence whatsoever to support this claim. None.The Intruder theory, touted by simpletons such as Lou Smit - who I believe to be acting in a deceitful, self-serving manner, especially in conjunction with Michael Tracey (who started the whole John Mark Karr fiasco) - simply does not hold up.Anybody who could get into the Ramsey house, carry out such an impossibly stealthy and protracted operation without leaving any DNA or other evidence, would be both a genius and a magician.A genius would not have stopped to HAND WRITE a moronic kidnap note. End of story. Nobody in their right mind could believe that.To put this all together... Given that the Intruder theory does not stand up in any way, and therefore there cannot even have been an intruder; and given that the Ramseys are literally the ONLY people who can definitely be placed in the house on that night, who do YOU think killed JonBenet Ramsey?The way I see it, the Ramseys tried to use money power and vile, bully boy lawyers to evade manslaughter charges and to pervert the course of justice, while simultaneously trying to silence people like Steve Thomas.They failed.While these are my own conclusions, please read Steve's book and make up your own mind. Highly recommended.

Flawed but excellent. I have given this album 5 stars because when she's good, she's incredible.21 Things is a brilliant opener, with its slick lyrics and chunky Rock guitar. Then she presents us with Narcissus, which is the closest thing she has ever done to a disposable track - mainly because of the jumbled and anti-climactic chorus. Mercifully, this is followed by the mighty Hands Clean, which is quintessential Alanis.Perhaps more than any other album, Rug showcases the finer side of Alanis' vocals, both lead and harmony, and there are many well constructed tracks, from ballads such as Flinch to heavier numbers such as 21 Things and A Man.For my money, the album should have ended with Surrendering and the weaker Utopia should have been shuffled backwards in the running order.Full marks to Maverick for giving us a tasteful, arty cover - a great relief after the ghastly debacle of the Infatuation Junkie cover.This album, both lyrically and musically, reinforces Alanis' importance as a major female Rock artist and role model, and to this degree, completely vindicates my featuring of her several times in my first book.Rock Goddess? Absolutely.

After the so-called 'review' of a Sarah Brightman DVD in which the Editorial Reviewer trashed her physical form, I am not surprised to find another simple life form trashing this piece of research.Everybody knows how questionable regression data can be; but to suggest that every single case that serious researchers like Mack and Jacobs have examined and even personally overseen, is a pure fantasy, is simply ridiculous.If even one out of the now thousands of Abduction-related regression sessions was genuine, and statistically, this is somewhat likely, then there is reason for concern.Military abductions, while indeed a reality, are a parallel issue, although there are clearly crossovers, and there is no single group or agenda involved; that is why it is complicated, and why there are apparent contradictions in some areas, concerning recall.The concept of a hybridization program has evolved over a period of decades, and while there can be no irrefutable evidence at this time, to dismiss the very concept as foolish is simply infantile. During the last 10 years in particular, the number and quality of credible UFO sightings has increased by a quantum factor. Yet the biggest and most incontrovertible evidence of a higher intelligence at work on the Earth is the ever-increasing complexity of Crop Circles.Their complexity, the speed of their creation and their very construction at the most microscopic level of analysis, makes it impossible to dismiss. That is why they are appearing in such forms and such quantities. Only an arrogant fool would dismiss something of such power and of such clearly otherworldly origins.Looks like Amazon found one for their Editorial Review.

This is an excellent book. Paul's main point is that the basis for judging 'Obesity' is highly questionable.True obesity is a very serious problem and there are a lot of men and women out there who are genuinely obese. I actually know a woman who weighs 200 pounds more than I do as a 6'2" male, so it is a real health concern for people who are ACTUALLY in that category.However, the problem with the figures we are being presented with is that many of the people who are technically 'obese' do not look remotely obese to the person in the street. Paul's view, that this much-publicized level of obesity is greatly exaggerated, is a very important perspective.Yes, genuine obesity leads to numerous health problems, including severe joint damage to the knees and hips above all, but how many of the people who are technically 'obese' are truly in this risk range?As he suggests, there are various vested interest groups who by definition have something to gain by setting suppressive standards for weight attainment and maintenance. The fashion industry is the one of the biggest culprits, by establishing the 'norm' of the 105 lb woman. Woman? Try bio-mechanical coat hanger.I went ballistic a while ago when an Amazon editorial reviewer described goddess Sarah Brightman as being 'pudgy' on her Eden DVD (check out my review). When a divine creature like Sarah can be seen as 'pudgy' instead of 'womanly', we have to fight back.Moderation in all things is one of the keys to good health across the board. Arming yourself with knowledge is another. Regarding weight issues, this book is a darn good place to start.

A stunning book. While many anti-Nazi reviewers constantly try to play down the true level of the genius that lay within the ill-conceived Third Reich, there is no denying its reality - as this book and others prove.Comedian Bob Hope once invoked the wrath of the Russian Govt in the wake of the Sputnik success in the late fifties, when he said "I'd like to thank the 'Russian' scientists, but I don't speak German..." Germany was so far ahead of the Allies in everything from rocketry to sub-orbital aircraft technology, that you wonder how they could have lost the War.The Amerika Bomber concept alone that Griehl explores is one more example of how Hitler failed to appreciate what was being offered to him. There were at least 4 different bombers capable of hitting the Eastern USA, perhaps the best of which being the ME 264. Yet Hitler did not seem to understand the enormous propaganda and morale impact that regular German bombing raids against the US would have had.Perhaps the most stunning German design and overall concept was Sanger's 'Silverbird' sub-orbital bomber, that was to be launched on a rocket sled and propelled to the edge of space by a lengthy rocket burn, after which it would use a 'skipping' technique whereby the plane, in virtual glide mode, would keep bouncing off the atmosphere to the extent that it could literally fly around the world at high speed, bombing any target in the US on the way. The 8,000 lb bomb that it carried, dropped from the edge of space, would have had an enormously enhanced blast radius, giving it at least a battlefield nuclear weapon level of destructive capability.Sanger offered this project in 1935. It could have been operational by the early 1940's.The later US Dynasoar and Hypersoar projects were directly based on this German technology.A must read.

For the longest time I wondered if Collide would ever take their magic on the road, and how they would be able to translate their studio genius into live songs. I needn't have worried.From the stunning opening number, Beneath The Skin onwards, this powerful, six-piece Collide takes no prisoners. While the utterly divine Karin prowls the stage like a lioness, the band sustains a richly-layered sonic attack that breathes new life into these already superb songs.Kai Kurosawa's mastery of the touch-sensitive Warr guitar is a joy to behold, enabling him to play a fascinating combination of guitar and bass on some of the numbers, alternating with his other bass guitar. All three guitarists have tremendous stage presence, especially when they are throwing themselves into some of the more physical numbers, and the drummer is as good as it gets.The extras are absolutely superb, including an interview with Karin and Statik and some great videos, including a superb version of the showstopper, Wings of Steel.I emailed Kai recently and he said he was hoping to be going on the road with Collide again in the not too distant future.This is a must-have DVD.

Critics have been going after Our Lady from the beginning, and as with the stunning Ray of Light album, she has once again shown their mean-spirited criticism to be groundless and self indulgent.This is easily one of her best albums, and yet more evidence of her endless ability to reinvent herself. I walked into an HMV store during the playing of Hung Up, and it wasn't until halfway through Get Together that I realized I was listening to a new Madonna album. I bought it immediately."Do you believe in love at first sight?" Yes, and I also believe Madonna is one of the most talented and creative artists/performers in the history of music. On the heels of the first Kate Bush album in 12 years, to have this classic from Madonna is to be blessed indeed.

I came to this album after hearing Jemima Price's excellent solo album Easy, so I feel more kindly disposed towards the Tribute than some people.Jemma Price has an uncanny ability to duplicate Kate's voice, to the extent that there are many instances where you feel that the passages have been directly sampled. Yet when you hear her Easy album, which contains all original songs (except for the Cure's Love Cats), you realise that her voice is naturally very similar to Kate's.I have always regarded being a Kate Bush fan as something akin to being a Trekkie, in that you are part of a family of fans. Jemma Price is also a Kate Bush fan, and as a fan, she has put together a very impressive tribute album. As an author, I honoured Kate in my first book, even calling one chapter This Woman's Work, and Jemma has honoured her as a musician. Why this has drawn such a hostile reaction, I'm not really sure.If your sister or girlfriend or wife or daughter or mother had put together such a truly stunning collection of covers, you would be proud of her. Jemma is extremely gifted in a way which goes far beyond a mere imitative ability, as the quality of her own songwriting testifies.If you can look upon this as a collection of Kate Bush demos or out takes, you can treat it is an extension of the KB catalog. I have already fooled several people with songs from this album, including two hardcore Kate fans. Give the gal a chance, she's brilliant. If you don't believe me, check out her Easy album.

It's difficult to say too much about the insights given in this book without creating spoilers for the movie.Bruce's description of the evolution of the script and the basic story content, such as Jacob's Book of the Dead journey of the soul, including the inspiration for some of the stark gothic imagery, is enormously helpful for any fan of the movie.I found the movie to be very uplifting, and in its own way, quite beautiful. There are many excellent and representative photos to accompany the full script and Bruce's superb descriptive rundown on JL which he calls Jacob's Chronicle.This book would be very helpful for anybody who was confused by the movie or parts of the movie, yet who would like to understand more.The only minor blips in the script concern the Vietnam scenes. One point is that (in my copy anyway) he refers to a Field Hospital, yet a soldier in Jacob's shape would have been Dusted Off (air medevaced) to either a Surgical Hospital or an Evacuation Hospital (possibly having gone through the Battalion Surgeon's Forward Aid Station first.) In Nam, the Field Hospital was a larger, longer term care facility, which was more remote from likely action (despite its misleading name.)There is also a memo from Adrian Lyne stating that the movie is set in 1975, &quot;three years after the end of the Vietnam War&quot;. The war officially ended in April 1973.The only other Nam technicality was that where Bruce refers to &quot;two Orderlies&quot; in the script, the men would have actually been Corpsmen (a form of Medic.)Great movie, powerful ending. Read all about it.

The good news is that Jane Bainter, the Perry/Casey associate whose addiction led to the band's name, did get and stay clean, and apparently she also eventually got to Spain, too.Nothing's Shocking is as much a piece of Art as a cutting edge Thinking Person's Metal album. This is even reflected in the utterly haunting cover photo of a Perry Farrell sculpture of a pair of naked Siamese Twins with their heads on fire, sitting on a wicker chair.As many of you will know, the 'Twins' were made from a papier mache body cast of Perry's then girlfriend, the remarkable Casey Niccoli, which was then duplicated and fused. Whatever its origins, it is an unforgettable image and naturally caused major controversy on the album's release.Musically, Nothing's Shocking includes some of Jane's best work, although apparently the band wrote most of the material for their first three albums when they first got together.The stunningly beautiful 'Jane Says' went on to become one of the most played Rock ballads of all time, along with U2's 'One' and Led Zeppelin's 'Thank You' and 'Stairway To Heaven'.Yet this album also contains such powerhouse numbers as Ocean Size, Mountain Song and Pigs In Zen (Pigs, not on the original vinyl - not my UK copy, anyway) which can just about blow the doors off any competition you could name.If I recall correctly, Ted Just Admit It was recorded while serial killer Ted Bundy was still around, and was all the more chilling because of that fact.Rather than babble further, I would just ask you to give this rare work of genius a listen, and savor the breathtaking combination of Perry Farrell's unique and hypnotic vocals, Dave N's brilliantly inventive guitar work and as classic a collection of songs as you will ever get on one album.'Just Because' from the new album is a reminder of the awesome power that the band can still wield, but this album right here, is the one that put them on the map.

Sure, Billy Bob, sure. Call me a Right Winger (You're a Right Winger, Steve) but this guy dragged the Presidency through its lowest trough since Watergate.As if the pitiful "tried Pot but didn't inhale" fiasco didn't tell us what kind of man, or was it lying toad, we were dealing with, he tops it all off by betraying his wife and disgracing his Office by obtaining Executive Relief from a cheap tramp in the dang White House itself.The shameful lack of condemnation from various Liberal factions speaks volumes about their collective integrity. Coulter quite rightly nails Billy Bob on this issue, which was a double moral outrage, but also on major concerns such as Whitewater.Her case for impeachment is unassailable, especially given her own Legal background, and the limping dog denials by the Clinton Right Or Wrong brigade do nothing to diminish the strength of Ann's arguments.This is a very important book, but the ultimate Coulter Classic is Slander: Liberal Lies About The American Right, which was understandably an Amazon best seller. There's not much to stand up and cheer about in this world, but Ann Coulter's books certainly fill the bill.

No, it ain't perfect, but then nobody claimed it was. Any book/film that approaches anything resembling religious philosophy will trigger people, as the varying reviews have indicated. Unlike the Harry Potter phenomenon, we haven't seen Right Wing Christians burning copies of What The Bleep yet, but it still managed to get people fired up.Ironically, the film's biggest weakness is that it focuses far too much on the physical, with 'experts' repeatedly babbling about receptors and peptides. That's all fine and dandy, but you can't possibly hope to understand anything about the nature of the human experience without at least brushing on Bell's Theorem/Non-Locality as it relates to Eastern mysticism, The Baghavad Gita etc. The chaff factor among the various speakers is such that even though the concept of Oneness is fleetingly mentioned, it never takes center stage in the form of an open recognition of Collective Consciousness.I'm giving it 5 stars because it's a good introduction to Quantum Theory, even though it doesn't really touch on the literally dozens of Quantum Reality Theories of how and why we perceive reality, and what it even means - such as Observer Created Reality (only dealt with tangentially), whereby things theoretically only exist in the presence of Consciousness, and Bentov's theory that there is only Consciousness in the Universe.'Experts' babble about 'creating reality' but none of the speakers get down to the nitty gritty and expand on their fleeting insights enough to give the new viewer a solid foundation.Yet this is a highly entertaining film, with John Ross Bowie just about stealing the show as Elliott, during the Polish Wedding scenes. To my surprise, this film manages to be funny and sexy while also being informative, albeit at a very superficial level. The young guys scoping the females at the dance were very entertaining. The First Person Luster camera work, whereby the guys were evaluating the females on a Terminator-style visual overlay, was surprisingly un-PC - especially contrasting the 'FOX' evaluation for an attractive woman with the SYSTEM CRASH response to viewing an older, obese female.At the other end of the PC spectrum, you have the Wise Male Black Kid with, guess what? A basketball.The soundtrack is excellent, and be sure to get a DVD with the extras, which include the stunning Aeon Spoke video. Their haunting Coldplay-like song Emmanuel introduces the scene in which the beautiful Marlee Matlin is just waking up after the Night Before.If you can live with a few instances of facile political correctness, this is a DVD worth watching, and in my opinion, worth investing in.Hey, how about that bleeping Polka?

An excellent collection of the vast majority of his published works.While Eliot lived into the sixties, there is an inevitable temptation to concentrate on his earlier classic works such as The Love Song Of J Alfred Prufrock, which yielded the above line, The Waste Land and The Hollow Men above all.A lot of Eliot's perspectives involve psychological impotence, and a majestic failure to act, and be a part of events, of the World, the Life, if you like; such as in the lines "I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing for me."Here, he writes about isolation and alienation, with accompanying non-participation. The impotent voyeur, as in Joyce's Ulysses, based on the classical myth. Joyce's Sirens are Lydia and Mina, the 'sexy barmaids' at the Ormond Hotel. Bloom can hear their siren song from the next bar, as they lure the male clientele to part with their cash, but he is separate from events; reflecting cyborg-like on their music which he terms 'musemathematics'.While The Waste Land and The Hollow Men in particular were clearly written during a time of deep spiritual crisis, Eliot did transcend this period and they are not really representative of his later life philosophy.One stanza from T S Eliot's The Hollow Men, became the source of Nevil Shute's book title On The Beach - this being his 1957 post-apocalyptic novel which later appeared as the 1963 Gregory Peck movie of the same name, about the last doomed survivors of a nuclear holocaust.In this last of meeting placesWe grope togetherAnd avoid speechGathered on this beach of the tumid riverThe J G Ballardesque inner landscape that Eliot creates, of decaying cities and civilizations and the encroaching spiritual desert, `sunlight on a broken column', the final phase of extreme Entropy, the suppression of the Eternal Feminine, is just all part of the ultimate fear of nothingness or perhaps meaninglessness that has gnawed away at the human psyche for eons.Just as Ballard's ancient nuclear test site in The Terminal Beach, replete with its decrepit bunkers and blockhouses, is 'a fossil of Time Future', so too is Eliot's Waste Land a metaphor for the human inability to perceive Time and to merge with the flow of the Universe.A genius? Absolutely no question about it.

That's the question that this well-made Lancaster-Singer classic asks above all.Yes, if you are fighting a courageous rearguard action so that the bulk of your forces can either escape or regroup, it is a necessary and noble sacrifice.If you are just struggling to keep an all-pervasive Enemy at bay without adequate logistical support and all overseen by a US Government 12,000 miles away that never established a clear Win Scenario or even initiated a single strategic air offensive against the North until December 1972, the phrase 'worth it' becomes a hard thing to assess.Even during the Advisor Period, it was clear that only by launching a 'parking lot' approach to the supply base areas, factories, ports, docks, airfields, SAM sites, you name it, in the North, could the countless tactical victories of US troops in the South ever be consolidated."Charlie... I'm going home now... if they'll let me..." so said the mighty Marc Singer after one of the best performances of his career.No, the US troops didn't lose in Vietnam, it's just that Winning was never an option...

Finally somebody who actually knows what he's talking about. GB obviously walks the walk, and his passion for the subject has enabled him to write a virtually flawless meisterwerk, which should become the standard Goth reference book.This is a first class piece of research, and while I am primarily interested in the musical side of Goth, it was also fascinating to read Gavin's insights into Gothic influences in art, theatre and film.This is so comprehensive that few people should be able to say, "Oi, you forgot to mention..." The Hunger? It's in here. Bauhaus? Yep, a no-brainer. Gavin encompasses even fringe bands and artists, such as camp Cabaret-style vamps such as Marc Almond, punkish Adam Ant (pre and post transition to the Dandy Highwayman) and The Cure, who in my opinion mainly qualify because of Robert's time with Siouxsie. At the other end of Fringe, GB also includes Black Metal/Goth band Cradle Of Filth, whose Her Ghost In The Fog video is a must-see.This modern Goth/Pop Culture classic mentions literally all of my favourite bands, ranging from Bauhaus and Type O Negative, to more melodic Goth acts such as The Mission (UK), Switchblade Symphony (you HAVE to hear Serpentine Gallery), the impossibly beautiful Katharine Blake's Miranda Sex Garden and The Shroud.This masterpiece is also packed with excellent photographs, many of which I have never seen before. I simply cannot fault it.

Not being Greek, I wouldn't presume to judge the accuracy of some aspects of the book's historical perspectives, and I respect the opinions of Greek people who might question some of them.However, taken as a beautifully woven tale of star-crossed lovers set against the background of the eternal insanity of war, Corelli's Mandolin is unsurpassed.I agree it's hard to envisage how a movie could do it justice, but I shall eventually get around to watching it.There are many qualities to be admired in all of the main characters, and if the book has a weakness, it is, as others have said, the degree of acceleration towards the end, which creates an asymmetrical aspect to the story flow.As a thinking person's romance in time of war, this is as good as it gets, and the intelligent conclusion, which spans decades, is ultimately very uplifting.Beautiful cover, too.

It is gratifying and most helpful that a prominent Jewish conductor has presided over one of the best interpretations of the Ring I have ever seen.Helpful, because on the heels of Jean Shinoda Bolen's Jungian interpretation of the Ring mythology, Levine has helped all Wagner fans move further away from the Nazi stereotype that has always dogged the operas. For too long, the Wagner fan has been seen as a caricature Lone Nutter, who listens to Wagner at full blast while easing back into his armchair with a copy of Mein Kampf and a stein of lager, with a huge swastika draped across the wall in front of him.Levine and other Jewish Wagner fans have been able to, as Dimitri Drobatschewsky put it, separate art from the artist. It's not as if Wagner was alone in his anti-semitism, anyway. It was primarily Hitler's adoption of Wagner for his own ends that created the Evil Composer tag.The Rheingold sets the standard for the rest of the Cycle, this being the prelude to the trilogy. Levine is both inspired and inspiring and delivers at every level throughout. Morris is an impressive, if at times, a little under powered Wotan, his passing resemblance to Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees notwithstanding. Behrens consistently proves why she has long been considered the ultimate Brunnhilde. The only visual blip being that, through no fault of her own, she is rather too close in age to Morris to be a credible daughter.The sets are generally adequate, and at times, excellent, although other productions have slaughtered this version, especially in the Rheingold - the controversial, yet visionary 1983 Bayreuth production (The English Ring) above all. In the Bayreuth '83 Ring (which also featured the superb Behrens), the Rhinemaidens were sylph-like and naked against a stunningly original backdrop, which gave the production a pagan and elemental flavour that is somewhat lacking in the Levine version.However, this remains a top notch production and one of the few versions to be currently available. At the prices Amazon are offering, you simply can't go wrong. Having just received my copy of Gotterdammerung, I now have the entire Ring and I certainly take my hat off to James Levine and his superb cast and crew. Get it while you can, people. These things have a way of becoming unavailable rather quickly.

What else would you expect from the greatest band in the history of the known universe?Pagey has done us proud with this stunning live 3 disc album which finally does justice to the mighty Zep. The track list is impressive and the versions are second to none.Perhaps the strongest impression to come from listening to this masterwork is that Led Zeppelin were a true BAND. Not just one or two guys out front ego-tripping, but a cohesive four piece unit in which every member was totally essential to the overall output. Just as the Beatles could never have carried on if Ringo or George had passed away, the Zep boys knew that the loss of any one of them should mean the end of the band. That is to be respected.If Led Zeppelin has a successor, it would have to be U2, in that there is nobody to touch them at this time (although on a creative level, I love The Mission UK.) Just as there was literally nobody to come even close to the magic that was Led Zeppelin.Yes, this is as good as it gets.

...well, 90 minutes...A wonderful and courageous film that Dirk (Death In Venice) Bogarde literally risked his career on. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and the film was a success both in terms of the box office, and also in opening up the debate over the suppressive and archaic laws regarding homosexuality.I recall an interview in which Dirk talked about how strong and supportive the divine Sylvia Syms had been throughout the making of this classic of the British film industry; and the chemistry between these two superb actors is a major component of the film's power.As others have pointed out in their superb reviews, homosexuality was still very much illegal in 1961 while film was being made, and even after it was decriminalized in 1967, the age of consent for homosexual sex was 21, while it was only 16 for heterosexual sex.After much pressure from the GLBT community and other concerned groups, the age of consent for homosexual sex in Britain subsequently dropped to 18 in 1994 and 16 in 1998.An essential film that may well have been the catalyst for some long overdue social change.

...in black...If I had to sum up MirrorMask in one sentence, I would describe it as 'an allegory about Individuation'. This was Jung's term for the process by which we integrate or align the personal with the universal consciousness and ultimately become whole.If Neil's script seems lacking in emotional fluidity at times, it is probably a deliberate mechanism to convey the varying degrees of emotional shutdown that people experience when transitioning between developmental states.Just as with Alice In Wonderland, Snow White, Peter Pan and The Wizard Of Oz, the story involves a young female's transition to womanhood and all of the pantheon of archetypal combatants that invokes.While Dorothy needed the mechanism of the ruby slippers (the moonblood of the Sacred Feminine) to get back 'Home' and restore order - the sacrificed Feminine - it is the magic of the MirrorMask itself that enables the healing of spiritual wounds (identity/alienation) in Neil and Dave's visually striking masterpiece.The bottom line? Oz is Kansas.Lord knows when I'll get to see the film, but having read this stunning 'guide', I can't wait, damn it. Ten stars.There's a light, over at the Gaiman place...

This is a very helpful and well presented DVD, which includes input from major figures such as Wayne Dyer, Gregg Braden, Doreen Virtue and Christiane Northrup.I found the beginning a little irritating as the woman who was voicing her negative thoughts was mumbling so much that I missed a lot of what she was saying.Having seen a number of these Self-Help, Positive Thinking programs, including Tony Robbins, I think the key factor that people need to develop in following positive/transformational courses of action is patience.However much you work towards change, via your thinking and daily actions, it will not happen overnight. But even if something takes two years to come to full fruition and give you a significantly better life, it is clearly well worth the time, given that you may have thirty, forty, fifty or more years of life left ahead of you.That's a pretty good ratio, and since you have to live those two years anyway, you may as well live them filled with hope, positive thinking and ACTION. That is where Tony Robbins excels... taking action as well as changing your thinking is everything, and Louise certainly undertands that herself.This is a good introduction to Louise's work, and the woman is living proof of its worth. She is a tremendous presenter and her own life story is extremely inspirational.

...I have yet to see her. Another exceptional performance from the absurdly talented Collette, whose chameleon-like ability to switch from the goofiness of Muriel's Wedding to the most intense drama, puts her way ahead of the crowd.To be honest, despite great casting, production, direction and cinematography, I found the movie to be a little under-powered and asymmetrical. The five stars are for Toni, who always, always gives 1000%.Definitely worth watching, but I have yet to see Toni in a film vehicle that is truly worthy of her brilliance.

If Ronald Reagan was "an amiable dunce", Carter and Ford were simple unicellular organisms.This book is a stirring account of one good man's holy crusade against the cancer of Communism. While it is empirical that Stalin made Hitler look like a nancy boy, the post-Stalinist Russia remained a War-based economy that relied on mass slave labour. A gulag is a gulag and a bully is a bully.Yet even though The Ron achieved a great deal in his own right, the book recognizes that it was his partnership with Margaret Thatcher, whom the Russkies termed "The Iron Maiden", that drove the final well-deserved nail into the Soviet coffin.The combination of the Star Wars defence programme and the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe, coupled with the total resolve of Reagan and Thatcher simply crushed the Russian Government's spirit.The book does not really explore the extent to which The Ron may have exaggerated the extent of the Soviet threat, although it it clearly better to over-estimate an enemy than the reverse. You can never have too many anti-tank missiles.I recall from military intelligence sources back in the seventies that there was a concensus that the Russian troops in the Soviet Bloc countries were garrison troops and that the populations detested the Russians even more than we did. For this reason, many analysts secretly felt that any Soviet attack on Western Europe would break up during the first 48 hours, partly due to the sheer decimation of Russian armour (even without Tac Nukes), and that this would quickly precipitate the collapse of the Soviet Union.Whether Ron knowingly exaggerated "Soviet" power or not, he certainly beefed up NATO to a point where the enemy could no longer compete, especially in the sphere of hi-tech weaponry.A great book about a great man, who ended the Russian reign of terror in Eastern Europe.

...in my modern Gothic novel, One Star Awake. The Katacoombs being a Gothic/Dark Culture nightclub, in which the likes of Bauhaus, Switchblade Symphony, Nightwish and The Mission UK tend to be played, in a dry ice-drenched wasteland in New England.In the real world, I must throw myself at reviewer Erica Anderson's feet for recommending this superb band. The combination of Erica's rightful praise of Nightwish (I also ordered their latest DVD) and the title The Siren made me take a chance on this CD single/mini album, as my own book is heavily laced with mermaid/siren imagery.From the outset, when the band come at you with a chunky wall of cello and electric violin, this CD delivers value off the scale. Tarja's operatic vocals (especially evident on the closing track,) soar majestically over a solid Gothic Rock foundation, and it is a pleasure to have three versions of this superb song, along with an excellent live version of Megadeth's Symphony of Destruction. Dave would be pleased, I'm sure.While there is a very Germanic feel to the band and even in their looks, they hail from Finland, where they are understandably huge. My copy came through (from Holland, I think) in less than a week, so it's a safe bet to order this and other CDs by the band.If there's a more beautiful woman in this world than Tarja, I have yet to see her. Having a classically-trained goddess like her fronting a band as powerful as this one, especially given the band's writing prowess, is just about as good as it gets.Superb.

Definitely a more mature album than the excellent, 30 million selling Jagged Little Pill, but I have one complaint... Who on Earth decided on that ghastly Frank Zappa Uncle Meat style cover? Even if it was Alanis, it was a mistake.Whether AM likes it or not, her physical beauty is part of the package and several people (female and male) I know felt cheated by this hideous travesty of a cover, which I believe could have cost millions in potential sales.Thankfully the new album, Under Rug Swept, has a cover which evokes the same feel as JLP. If they re-issued Junkie with a decent new cover AND with the track Uninvited, I would buy it again. Hint hint.

Jagged Little Pill went on to sell more than 30 million copies, making it the biggest selling album by a female of all time and one of the biggest selling albums, period.Just one listen and you can see why. For my money there isn't any chaff whatsoever on this album - i.e. no redundant tracks. Don't be fooled by the media hype which dismisses Alanis as an Angry White Female. Apart from the boyfriend bashing track &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; there is no concentrated lyrical effort in this area.This is a solid Rock album which pivots on Morissette's &quot;This is me, take it or leave it&quot; honesty - a refreshing thing in an industry full of posers. There are so many classic tracks on this album that it is futile to list them, and I would strongly recommend JLP as a logical entry point to AM's recorded works.Another one for the Desert Island CD collection.

Having grown up in England (30 miles from RAF Elvington, where a Polish RAF bomber squadron operated during WW II) and studied a great deal about the Battle of Britain, let me say one thing...There cannot possibly be any doubt whatsoever that the courage and combat experience of the two Polish RAF fighter squadrons who joined in the Battle of Britain, turned the tide at a critical moment.At a time when the RAF was barely able to train pilots fast enough to replace combat losses, to have highly trained combat experienced pilots like the Poles come on board was a much needed shot in the arm.While the Polish airmen had struggled against the Me109s in their own Polish Air Force fighters (even then they inflicted disproportionate losses on the enemy), in the state-of-the-art RAF fighters they were unbeatable.As the book indicates, they were so popular and successful in downing record numbers of enemy planes, that Churchill and the King visited the squadron to show their appreciation.During the War many Polish airmen served in fighter command (in RAF squadrons as well as Polish RAF squadrons) and in bomber command. Let us not forget also, that it was Polish troops who finally stormed Monte Cassino in the Italian campaign, and took the German surrender.Sadly, the book also details how the unforgivable betrayal of Poland and its wonderful, courageous people, was arranged by the western allies, who agreed to the demands of that filthy butcher Stalin.Hard to believe that the British, who actually went to war over the Nazi invasion of Poland, would give her up to a moron and a tyrant who was provably even worse than Hitler.Sorry for the strong words, but they are appropriate in this case. Ask any Pole with a sense of history.I was curious to read that in a poll at the end of the War, a majority of Brits thought the Poles should return 'home'. Not that their home existed anymore.I had about five Polish-English kids in my class as I was growing up in England, and my sense was that their families were very respected, not only because their dads had served with honor in the RAF or the Polish regiments of the British Army, but also because they hated the Russians even more than we did (this was Cold War England), so they could do no wrong in a climate of Commie hating.Poland is now a NATO country, resting under the Alliance nuclear umbrella. It is no longer possible to invade Poland without risking annihilation.It's about time.

I think Allison's review has captured the off-center magic that permeates this book, and in its own way, Dick's remarkable life.The first time I saw the striking cover was while my graphic designer, Laurie Burke of Subtext, was putting the finishing touches together. Later, when I read the book, I marvelled at how Laurie's asymmetrical imagery paralleled the bewitching asymmetry of Dick's memoir - as brilliantly captured by Allison.Dick was a fine human being, flaws and all, and a man who was not afraid to take a long, hard look at himself and his life, good and bad. Through it all, his sense of how lucky he was to have spent his life with the enchanting Seesaw Girl is both touching and refreshing.As for it being too challenging a read, I grew up on William Burroughs, so this is a walk in the park.I hope the resurgence of interest in Things Bewitched due to the excellent Nicole Kidman/Will Ferrell movie, will boost the sales of this wonderful book and this unique insight into the man who immortalized Sam's mortal husband. We miss them both.

As a recently-published author, I would like to express my admiration for the work of Barbara G. Walker. Of all the sources that I quoted from my bibliography, Walker was by far the most significant. The Woman's Encyclopedia is the most valuable book in my collection, and it represents a superhuman piece of research. The suppression of the Feminine and the patriarchal re-writing of history can be traced through innumerable references - from Christianity's assimilation of pagan rituals and festivals to the creation of the mythology of feminine evil. Walker, like Jungian analyst June Singer, believes that patriarchal religion is the basis for the suppression of women. The case she builds is frankly unassailable. After reading this classic study, one cannot fail to see the transforming power of the Mother Goddess in everything from A Midsummer Night's Dream and Finnegans Wake to Mary Poppins and The Matrix. Barbara Walker is a modern-day Wisewoman, and we can never have enough of those. In a sterile, left-brain, hunter-killer psytocracy, Walker's books shine like a beacon for those who still have the strength to dream.Steven Cain (Author of Sirius Moonlight: The Origins Of The Suppression Of The Feminine.)

There is nothing I can really add to Robert L. Hargett's superb review except to say how inspirational this wonderful album and this wonderful man always were.Back To The World, the track, was Curtis's tribute to all of the GI's who were coming back to the US, which the Vietnam Vets called The World, but especially the black GI's, who seemed to be serving in disproportionate numbers, especially towards the latter stages of the War.The way in which he included NASA comm traffic on a song about returning soldiers, was simply inspired, and really underscored the sense of alienation that the Vets, all of them, felt on returning to a hostile reception - one that would last for decades.A beautiful album from the genius who brought us Mighty Mighty, Spade and Whitey, one of the most powerful assaults on the stupidity of racism ever recorded.We were blessed to have him with us for a while, and we are saddened by his passing.

Brilliant, beautiful and profoundly disturbing. As many people have given excellent insights into the content of Was, I will just mention my own interpretation of this utter classic.For me, the book (and even the Baum original) exists on many levels. Whereas Oz may be seen as a quantum pocket within the linear story track, it is the human experiences and the very nature of consciousness and identity that really drives the entire concept.Yet the search for Dorothy's home is as much a bitter-sweet futility as the search for the Holy Grail, and merely takes you deeper into the Illusion and farther away from your true Self.This multi character odyssey brings in many profound insights from various classic areas - from Dante's Inferno, the concept that the way to Heaven is through the deepest pit of Hell - from Zen, the concept that there is no Truth that exists outside of you, or as Alan Watts put it, "This is it" - and from the Baghavad Gita, the final realization that the warrior Arjuna learns from Krishna, that there is no mutant enemy, except ourselves.As the song Tin Man by America suggests, The Wizard of Oz never gave anything to the Tin Man that he didn't already have.Was and WOZ are both about the concept of Home, of belonging. Like Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, they are about Return. The return to the Cosmic Womb of the Great Mother.I believe what Geoff Ryman is trying to tell us is that when you have finally found yourself, Oz is Kansas.

Gilliam is never afraid of taking artistic risks, and in Tideland, he pushes the boat out as far as he ever has. Yet this Wizard of Oz meets Alice In Wonderland saga delivers an unforgettable experience to the patient viewer.Once again Gilliam is working with the mighty Jeff Bridges, who joined Gilliam in the masterpiece, The Fisher King. The young Canadian actress Jodelle Ferland was absolutely astonishing as Jeliza-Rose. She went on to do other major movies such as Silent Hill and Twilight: Eclipse.Striking UK actress Janet McTeer once again proves her chameleon-like ability to assume any character, with her lean, six-feet tall frame adding even more power to her haunting portrayal of Dickens's crazy older sister, Dell.Tideland is a fascinating study of how a traumatized young girl's mind deals with the madness that is her everyday life, and the pseudo-realities with which she buffers herself from the abyss.The second disc has some excellent bonus features, including a 'making of' featurette and the lengthy and insightful Getting Gilliam, as well as deleted scenes, all of which are excellent.

I have long been a James Cameron fan, but Avatar far exceeded even my expectations.While there are obvious allegorical threads tying the plot together, the grand conclusion that this intelligently written epic offers to us is that beyond Gene Roddenberry's vison of One World, One People, there lies the ultimate Truth - that we are One Universe, One Consciousness, and Love is the greatest force there is.If you think that's a sappy assessment, you have missed the entire point of the movie.The special effects and non-stop action are second to none, and the entire cast, including the mighty Sigourney Weaver, give 100%.An outstanding work of art from a true genius.

I agree with the previous review. This is a wonderful book.The research is very methodical and James Pack doesn't go on any rants here. So allow me...Long before the RAF held back the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, 1940, the British Royal Navy stood as the UK's first line of defense. The Royal Navy is the main reason that the Brits still speak English and various forms of Gaelic.No, you can't have sloshed sailors handling sub-launched ICBM's, but equally, to remove the entire ration of aptly named Nelson's Blood is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Like when they got rid of the full-sized aircraft carriers and their only AEW aircraft, the Fairey Gannet. Goodness knows the lives and equipment this plane could have saved in The Falklands War.Sometimes the responsible use of alcohol can steady combat nerves and actually reduce the fear factor, which on it's dark side, can lead to panic-initiated mistakes.A great book.

I read Child of Fire as part of the research for my own Emily Bronte novel, and I was very impressed to see that Maureen has also adopted the use of 'real-time' dialogue, i.e. setting the book in its actual time period, and having the characters converse normally. This is a welcome change from the sterile technique of telling the story by the use of letters/journal entries, as used by a number of authors, including James Tully, Emma Tennant and Jill Jones.While some of the events/time periods are a little rushed through, this is still a well-written story arc, which tracks the lives of Charlotte and her family, through her catastrophic choice of the controlling Arthur Bell Nicholls and until her untimely death.Maureen handles all of the issues in a subtle manner, from the suggested relationship with Ellen Nussey to the impact of Nicholls and the death of her sisters and Branwell. She even makes reference to Emily's second novel and her increasingly out of touch father, Patrick Bronte.The suggestion that Nicholls had in some way poisoned the sisters, and ultimately Charlotte herself, which James Tully had made in The Crimes of Charlotte Bronte, is only hinted at here; but his covert destructive influence, which included the monitoring of her private letters to Ellen Nussey, and his destruction of all of Ellen's hundreds of letters to Charlotte, speaks volumes about his manipulative qualities. Perhaps the final blow being when he got Charlotte to change her Will in his favor, while she was effectively on her deathbed.Her husband of only nine months inherited everything, including the copyright on the content of Charlotte's hundreds of letters to the true love of her life, who sought no material thing from her.As Elaine Miller proved in her essay, Through All Changes and Through All Chances, from the book Not A Passing Phase, by the Lesbian History Group, the many letters that Ellen kept in spite of Arthur's demands that she destroy them, indicated a long term passionate relationship between the two women and their desire to ultimately live together, 'until Death'.Perhaps the greatest tribute to the deep affection that existed between these wonderful women was best captured in Ellen's comment... "She told me things she never told anyone else. I have hundreds of her letters, and I had her heart."

Having just watched another "Did we really go to the Moon?" program, I decided to revisit this review.The main thing that struck me having seen interviews with Doubters and NASA spokespeople is that while the Doubters make very specific observations, which they claim suggest a 'faking' of the Moon landings, the NASA people only make generalized denials.At no time did the principal NASA spokesman take the Doubter's points one by one and answer them directly. Even if you disregard the idea of the Van Allen Belt radiation question, and the flexing or blowing of the flag in a supposed vacuum, a number of points remain problematic.The main area that simply does not look legit is the area under and around the lander - in every single mission. Even given the relatively minimal thrust used during the final descent, there should have been some kind of blast crater, however shallow, under the lander. This, plus the fact that the lander legs were not in any way embedded in the lunar surface, nor was there any dust etc. on the pristine feet, does make the scene look far too neat and tidy. Like a set.The other big concern re: the lander is that during the remotely-viewed take-off, there is no visible thrust from the engine, and in take-off mode, there would have been more thrust than in braking to land. It certainly looks more like the unit has been yanked upwards by a cable, as the Doubters suggest.Equally, the photographs are another problem. Not only does there appear to be more than one light source in many of the photos, as evinced by the shadows falling in different directions, but the clumsy, chest-mounted cameras were such that they could never be aimed with any true precision. Yet somehow all of the lunar photos are beautifully centered, and in crisp focus.I am not even going to examine the suggestion that Gus Grissom was murdered in the launchpad capsule fire, other than to say that Doubters believe he was about to blow the gaff on the Apollo program, and its inability to complete the job by the end of the decade, due to numerous technical inadequacies. They also believe that other individuals were also killed in case they disclosed sensitive information.Did the Apollo team reach the Moon, or was it, as has been suggested, filmed on a set in Area 51? At this point, in the absence of disclosure, we cannot be sure, but the hostile reactions to any reviews which suggest that there may be some truth in the video, raise issues in themselves. Either NASA people are angered by the idea that they have been played for chumps, and that the entire program was just a Cold War political sideshow, or they are all getting their buddies to jump on and click "No" because they want to suppress even the idea that anybody has the right to question items that are by ANY definition, anomalies.No, the video does not prove anything definitively, but it does raise many genuinely intelligent questions that NASA have never adequately addressed and which they have refused to take seriously. But then, we all know about the power of Denial, don't we? Governments in all their forms are masters of it.This issue is far too important for NASA to stonewall it. Forty billion dollars of US taxpayer's money went into the Apollo program. Given this outrageous expense, it is morally unacceptable that NASA should just ignore a series of valid questions, which have not been addressed in more than thirty years. Surely NASA could spend a few grand making their own video in order to step-by-step handle every point raised by the Doubters - while having an open two-way discussion with the principal Doubters. That is, if it is possible to deny the claims of those that doubt the legitimacy of the Moon landings, and assuming that NASA has nothing to hide.To merely mumble about 'bad science' and ridicule Doubters and describe people as gullible 'nuts', WITHOUT a systematic examination and disproving of the most disturbing of the apparent anomalies, NASA are just proving what many people suspect - that they are so aloof and contemptuous of the public that paid their wages, they are acting as though they are a law unto themselves.Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE it if NASA would go ahead and effectively disprove the doubts raised by this and other videos. I totally accept that it may be possible for them to do so. Yet in the absence of such a structured analysis, I can only conclude that they are either just too arrogant and contemptuous to feel answerable, or they do indeed have a few skeletons in the closet.

Oh... Well, you certainly couldn't sue the company for using a misleading title. Mimi definitely receives a massage. That cannot be in doubt. From the wrong man, though...Yep, the Aussies and the Brits tend to pronounce it Mass-arge, rather than the US/Canadian M'saaaaaage or however the heck you would attempt to represent it phonetically.Irrelevant really, given the amount of Mimi nudity, which clearly should be the main focus here. I'm sure Loverboy's right about the movie failing as a foreplay enhancer, in that the story flashbacks do tend to break the rhythm of the genuinely erotic mass-arge sequences.Two decent actors here. Bryan has done many excellent movies both in and out of Oz - e.g. F/X 1 and 2 and the truly excellent Aussie Vietnam movie The Odd Angry Shot. Mimi... sigh... Mimi is just excellent, period.Yeah, what's that about her being overweight? Hello, this is a real woman and she looks fantastic. I didn't find the story such as it is to be that appallingly mind-numbing, but no, this ain't Tolstoy. In fact, if you turned the volume down and put on a Philip Glass opera, you could treat it as an ArtHouse movie.I am certainly waiting for the DVD. There are many times when the Step and Slow keys would enhance your enjoyment, as would the ability to skip flashback scenes.What a beautiful woman. For Pete's sake, Bryan Brown got a paycheck for this movie. It's not right.

A work of genius.While this is one of Woody's finest moments, it also brilliantly underscores one of the dilemmas of modern man.Allen's nerdy new age man Allan Felix is so in his head and ineffectual that his wife simply abandons ship - a brilliant observation on a social a trend that is if anything, on the increase.The magic and true genius of this movie lies in the way Bogart's grounding yet wild Dionysian energy drives Allen's UberNerd to stop whining and intellectualizing and just act. I'm slightly paraphrasing, but Bogie's ghost's advice to Felix to 'Tell her she's beautiful' and 'Go on, kiss her... Go on!' are a joy to behold.The revelation is that by finding his inner warrior, his wild man energy, he is actually successful, and creates a scenario in which the man and the woman can be more comfortable in their clearly defined, yet non-hierarchical roles.While there is immense significance in the role and transforming power of the Bogart figure, this is still a warm, loving and utterly crazy Woody classic and can be enjoyed on any level.Diane Keaton... sigh...

THIS is the true sequel to Wuthering Heights. Not that Jane Urquhart intended it to be, but it so outstrips Return To Wuthering Heights by Anna L'Estrange that it cannot help but unwittingly assume that mantle.Whereas L'Estrange's sequel is a fairly linear novel, which continues the saga through the lives of Heathcliffe and Catherine's descendants, Hareton and young Cathy, Urquhart gets inside Bronte's head and brings us the spirit of her creation, rather than the mere mechanics.Urquhart's stunning grasp of Emily Bronte's psyche is echoed in Camille Paglia's own cracking assessment of Bronte and her work in the magnificent Sexual Personae. Here, in Paglia's analysis of Bronte's self-referential high romantic prose poem, she writes of how the Byronic Heathcliffe is both Bronte's own projected animus (put simplistically, her Jungian Inner Male component) and in the context of the story, Cathy's as well.This metathesis, or literary transsexualization comes across in Urquhart's own brilliant re-weaving of the Brontean strands. Yet, such is the subtlety of Jane's unfoldment, that the female characters, including Emily Bronte (in spirit form, as is Arianna Ether) seem almost peripheral to the calculatedly one-dimensional, self-indulgent male characters. Such of course, is the history of patriarchy, in which women have traditionally been the Second Sex.The only exception to the male group thus defined is the character Hartley, who, by comparison is an almost Shamanic figure - a man in balance, who has surrendered to the wisdom of the eternal Feminine.I believe that Jane Urquhart has captured the elemental genius of Bronte's original work, with its relatively anarchic temporal shifting and box structure, in particular Bronte's deliberate use of the singular form of 'heaven' (in a related poem), rather than 'the heavens', which would be a more common choice when writing about the weather, the sky etc. The changing heaven is the changing Heaven, and the use of weather as a metaphor in Wuthering Heights, and therefore Changing Heaven, reminds you of the tornado in The Wizard of Oz, which again represented a vortex, connecting the worlds at the opposite ends of the labyrinth. Yin and Yang, Life and Death, Masculine and Feminine etc.Yet, as Dorothy discovered, when you have truly found yourself, Oz is Kansas. She never left, she merely transformed. Similarly, the temporal convergence that finally connects the female divine Trinity in Jane's epic work is a simliar point of transcendence, and resolution.I was so impressed by Changing Heaven that I even mentioned it at a pivotal point in my own impending modern gothic novel 'One Star Awake', and in my first work of non-fiction, Sirius Moonlight - concerning the suppression of the Feminine in patriarchal culture - such is the influence that Urquhart's mistresspiece has had on me - likewise, with Camille Paglia.Even the inspired act of latching onto the Bronte poem's phrase 'changing heaven' and relating it to the absolute core of Wuthering Heights, is a measure of Jane Urquhart's own genius.I simply cannot recommend this wonderful book highly enough.

It was the exquisite voice of the sadly late Barbara (Sandi) Robison (who passed away in 1988) which got me into PBC, the first time I heard Turn On A Friend (To The Good Life) on a CBS Rock Machine sampler album.As other fans have said, it was no lack of talent that kept this band from the big time. Sometimes people just don't get the breaks, either due to bad management, music industry politics or whatever. Incredibly, by 1969, it was essentially over, and the band that started out as The Ashes, would never record again as PBC.These two albums are both classics, though stylistically somewhat different. Each kicks off with a storming track - It's A Happening Thing from the first album, and the superb Turn On A Friend from the second. The quality of the songs, vocals, musicianship and arrangements is second to none, and you just cannot get away from the feeling that this band should have been absolutely huge.If you surf for the PBC unofficial website, it contains a link to a beautiful and informative tribute to Barb, which includes some beautiful photos of that fine fine lady, as does the website itself. I seem to recall the reason she became known as 'Sandi' is that as a teenager, she regularly used some false ID in that name in order to be able to play in clubs and bars.Wonderful, and Amazon.com does it again with this simply outrageous value-for-money double set.

While "kill 'em all" may be an extreme reaction, this book offers a number of highly satisfying solutions to the problem of persecution by the goose-stepping thugs of the world of debt collection.This book, along with Dover and Donovan's Back Off! empowers the reader with a vast quantity of information so that a victim may make informed decisions in dealing with their debt situation.While the finer points of the Law apply to the American Justice System, the principles may be applied in virtually any democracy. One of the most useful things about this book is that it explains the structure of the organizations and the PSYCHOLOGY of debt collection. Knowing your enemy is 90% of the battle.I would like to expand on the psychological aspects of the debt collection process. In my own experience, in which I was being hounded by a Canadian-based collection agency (some years ago), I noticed that they often use female collectors. This, plus the TONE OF VOICE used by these women is the key to the darker side of collection practices.All people usually subconsciously associate women with nurturing and the Mother figure. By the female debt collectors using a Standard Harsh Callous Unfeeling Cruel Debt Collector Tone Of Voice, they are deliberately trying to trigger a fear and panic response in their victims. This parallels the experiments in which female monkeys have had their facial nerves severed so that they cannot show emotion via facial expression, which causes extreme distress and panic in their babies.Debt collection, as it is usually practiced, is one of the most disgusting and utterly cruel practices in Western society. Many people have literally been driven to suicide by these monsters. Others have simply given up and declared bankruptcy, although as we see, this does not necessarily end the harassment. More than a few bailiffs have been shot dead by desperate debtors, and it is surely only a matter of time before somebody adopts a Tim McVeigh solution to the problem of harassment.This wonderful book clearly shows that it needn't come to this. Before you strap on ninety pounds of C-4 and six inch nails, please read this superb study. Not only will it be more satisfying to use the System to defeat these callous bullies, you'll even live to see the fruits of your actions!Please do not consider my above comments to be flippant. I know what went through my own mind during my darkest hours of persecution. While I was able to clear my own debts by getting a consolidation mortgage, there are many people who do not have this option, and for them, desperate measures will surely beckon.In the post-911 world, even debt collectors should be reflecting on their mortality. I urge you to arm yourselves with knowledge, not propylene oxide. Buy this book, and Back Off!, and beat the bullies at their own game. Nuke the system, not the building!

This is a solid, well-researched book that presents Heisenberg in a fair light, for once.One of the problems with reader/reviewer bias is that many people are pre-disposed to finding fault with any suggestions that conflict with what they want to hear or believe. Regarding the Farm Hall recordings, some people have latched onto the idea that Heisenberg and others knew of the build up of the Holocaust, but continued to work for the Bomb project.What they are usually referring to is a section in which Heisenberg talked about five Jewish scientists, whom he obviously cared about, who had been arrested and later killed; and even though Heisenberg was talking openly about putting out feelers to see if they could be helped or saved (which alone could have put him at great risk), this somehow translates into guilt in some people's eyes.As for him 'not co-operating with Hitler'... nobody in their right mind could possibly think that was an option. As I believe the book shows, Heisenberg did the next best thing, which was to work half-heartedly on the German Bomb. He basically killed it in 1942.The fact that Heisenberg could come up with the correct basic bomb structure - path and critical mass analysis, in very short order almost certainly means that he could have brainstormed the right methodology years earlier if the German scientists had been 100% committed to producing a bomb for Hitler. If they had been Nazis.To me, this fine book is one more step in the right direction, in underscoring the very fact that not all Germans were Nazis.Hitler may have been a charismatic leader, but he made so many catastrophic errors, such as the insane decision to declare war on the USA in the hope that the Japanese would help him against the Russians - they never lifted a finger - that it is as true to say that Hitler lost the War as to say that the Allies won it.A fair and highly recommended book.

... she was married to some guy... Dang it...I may never have heard this album had I not had a major crush on a certain Janet W., who I met at college. She kept raving about the album, and as a means of creating more common ground I picked it up, just to be able to flash my own copy (vinyl in those days).Surprise surprise, I was blown away. Richard had always been one of my favorite actors, but nothing could have prepared me for the intelligent way he negotiated so many stunning Jimmy Webb songs. He also went on to repeat the dose on The Yard Went On Forever.While the epic Mac Arthur Park was the rightful mega hit, there are many wonderful songs on this truly classic album. My personal favorites include Mac Arthur Park, Paper Chase, Didn't We, Name Of My Sorrow and Lovers Such As I.No, Richard didn't have the kind of voice that could challenge Jack Jones and Tony Bennett, but he did have a very pleasant voice and this, combined with his exceptional acting prowess, enabled him to add a magic of his own to the already intriguing Webb masterpieces.This is one of those rare comings together of two great artists who between them created a stunning whole that was even greater than the sum of the considerable parts.Janet? I think she became an accountant... Sigh...

While I am more familiar with Stevie's non-fiction works, including the indispensible Emily Bronte: Heretic, I found this novel to be absolutely delightful.Even though I found the style to be a little narrative-heavy in places, Four Dreamers manages to entertain at every level. Anyone who has attended Bronte conferences or even joined Bronte listgroups on the Net, will recognize the spectrum of zany zealots that Stevie presents here. Incredibly, while the wackiness of the competing 'definitive theories' may seem laughably far-fetched, it is in fact, frighteningly representative of the reality.Very strong characters, and a beautifully woven story, although I found the ending, though evocative, to be somewhat anti-climactic.Two thumbs up... (Gorgeous photo of Stevie on the back cover flap.)

Sue O'Neill along with Mary Reynolds Powell (A World Of Hurt) and Sharon Grant Wildwind (Dreams That Blister Sleep) is one of a rare breed of women who not only flew 10,000 miles into a war zone to support an Army whose average age was 19 (in WW II it was 26), she also had the strength and the vision to write about her experiences.Don't Mean Nothing is an essential Nam book, along with the late Lynda Van Devanter's Home Before Morning. While I don't accept that the war was literally unwinnable, I totally agree that the way it was being fought, with no sense of a Win Scenario at any time, resulted in a mindless and sickening waste of human life - on both sides.President Johnson, the simpleton who put more than 500,000 US troops in harm's way, yet never defined a Win Scenario or Exit Strategy, once boasted that the Air Force "couldn't even bomb an outhouse" without his approval. Similarly, the target selection for the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign in which the US lost 922 aircraft, was carried out at cozy White House lunches, without a single Air Force commander being present.Sue's anger at a mind-numbingly incompetent Government, who denied Ho Chi Minh a fair crack at democratic elections (which he may well have won) by installing the hateful and corrupt Diem in the South, is well stated.These stories take you under the hood, behind the propaganda and the lies and put you right there in the middle of a war that either should never have happened or which should have been fought very differently at the very least.A great writer. A great human being.

When you consider the shoot 'em up trash that seems to dominate the box office, it is sad to reflect on the relatively poor financial performance of this beautifully crafted movie.This is Neve Campbell's finest hour and as Malcolm McDowell said in one of the many superb interviews, if you can get Robert Altman on board, you have to be taken seriously. Likewise, to get a master such as McDowell, you have to have a very credible idea and a great deal of talent and passion. Neve has it all.While the film is a virtual documentary snapshot of a period in the Joffrey's life, it is very coherent and organic, and avoids the pitfalls of some of the more pretentious, non-linear Art movies. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Not everybody is a Cocteau or a Warhol.I liked the fact that the story is relatively non-hierarchical, and that Neve wasn't up on a pedestal. This works beautifully because it captures the cameraderie that exists in all good ballet/theater companies.I would like to have seen a little more of Malcolm McDowell's character, as he is a joy to behold in the way he fully becomes the character, as all good actors do, Neve included. The soundtrack is as exquisite as the many brilliant dance sequences, and the Special Features are wonderful.Very highly recommended.

I don't have a problem with basic Conspiracy Theory, in that the idea of The World Banking System ruling the planet makes sense. I can accept the Kennedy Conspiracy, Roswell, you name it, but like most people I find David's theories about all of the world's rulers being Reptilian shape-shifting Aliens a little hard to swallow. Especially when they are supposedly involved in the mass ritual sacrifice of children.I presume the way he avoids massive law suits for defamation is by claiming to be reflecting the views of people such as 'former mind control slave' Arizona Wilder, and by pleading Truth as a defence, insisting that the Royal Family, George Bush etc. must prove that they are not Aliens. Yet the way Conspiracy theorists work, no proof would ever be enough anyway. If the rulers did submit to DNA testing and were found to be wholly human, ole Dave would no doubt insist that the tests were rigged.Don't get me wrong, I can accept that the human race are a bunch of genetically engineered worker animals. Apart from the checked shirts, the booze, the smokes and the hockey, their willingness to accept injustice seems to be limitless. For example, nobody ever questioned the fact that a kid could be sent to Vietnam when he was 18, but couldn't by himself a drink until he was 21. Der...If there is a flaw in David's voluminous research, it is that he tries to shoehorn everything into a preset framework, intending that it should prove his point, come what may. He takes all historical references to be literal, rather than symbolic or metaphorical, such as the many ancient serpent references, which he ties in with the Reptilian lineage. To most people serpent imagery represents symbols of cthonic (underworld) transcendence, and in the case of the serpent eating its own tail, regeneration and eternal recurrence.If one got into a Conspiracy and Disinformation mindset, one could even question Dave himself. If you look at the effects that his work has on people, it can be quite damaging, by crushing their belief systems, by telling them that everything they ever believed was a lie, and by telling them that an unimaginably brutal and all encompassing Conspiracy, presided over by an all powerful Alien race has complete control of this planet, and has from day one.While he includes a relative throwaway acknowledgement that all beings are from the same life force, and that people should just do their own work and disconnect from the system as much as they can, his main focus is on the unimaginable horror of the human zoo.Icke's information about the Reptilians seems to come primarily from the testimony of individuals such as Arizona Wilder, who having somehow shaken off her mind control programming, can now "remember" seeing the British Royal Family as Reptilian shape shifters, who regularly indulge in the ritual murder of children. Yes, it could be true. Then again, these could be the fantasies of a disturbed individual, or somebody who just didn't get enough attention as a child, or somebody who is deliberately spreading disinformation in the hope that David Icke would lap it up and build entire books around the myth, and thereby lose the credibility that he was beginning to amass, prior to him going off the deep end.Anybody can claim to remember cosmic things. I could claim to have been an Alien military intelligence officer with the Templar garrison at Acre, but I could no more prove this than Wilder can prove one scrap of the genocidal shape shifter information that Icke so readily portrays as fact.Three stars for sheer audacity. Buy it soon, because if the Government ever tightens the defamation laws, David Icke will be in a sling.One final thought... If David Icke is right and his revelations are so revolutionary and devastating to the Power Elite, why is he still alive? Too high profile to be a target? JFK was as high profile as it gets. No, David Icke is being allowed to continue. Surely even a human could see that.

This is a welcome return to David's more believable Conspiracy roots, and he mercifully soft pedals the Reptilian stuff. The problem with books like Children of the Matrix is that he made a huge number of totally unsupported claims, based largely on the assumed legitimacy of a group of individuals who claimed to have witnessed many World leaders, including the British monarchy, shape-shifting to and from Alien form and being involved with the ritual slaughter and sexual abuse of children.The whole "people are remembering..." buzz was incredibly damaging to genuine Conspiracy theorists, many of whom are on the right track, including Icke himself. Which people saw these Reptilians? Are they credible? Have they taken PolyGraph tests?Back to the WTC book, David has raised a lot of interesting points, as you might expect, and there are indeed a lot of unanswered questions. The 'loss' of the Black Box flight recorders and the 'chance' finding of the hijacker's passport in the ruins, is just one example of too-convenient events.Was the whole thing staged? Very hard to say. Because of the covert way the System has always worked, it is hard to obtain true evidence. That the Islamic fundamentalists and their terrorist wings would do something like this and rejoice at the outcome is not in question. Anybody who has spent time in the Middle East knows that many arab countries are extreme patriarchal, Jew-hating dictatorships. No, I'm not a Jew, I have a Celtic ancestry.If David has a problem in his style, it is that he takes an idea which may or not be correct and runs with it and starts pyramiding 'facts' that are derived from that initial piece of assumption. This is how he got into the whole Reptilian Conspiracy thing.Yet the reference to how a Terrorist Insurance scam might have been a factor in the destruction of the Twin Towers leads us to a point that should be considered. Humans have treated each other with a mind-numbing level of callousness and brutality since the beginning. Humans. Humans were quite capable of carrying out the entire attack for their own greedy, psychotic ends just as they carried out the holocausts in Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, Iraq, North Korea and Communist China. We don't need Aliens to come along and enslave the human race, other humans have already got that under control. It's called the World Banking System.I am not in any way hostile to the idea of Alien lifeforms and their presence on the Earth. I think there is a 99% chance that the Roswell Incident involved the crash of a craft piloted by a non-human intelligence. I think it is entirely likely that the World Government has been fully in contact with Aliens in some form or another for decades. It is also entirely possible that the human race originated on Mars, and that the pyramidal structures in Cydonia, Elysium etc. are a leftover from this period.The mere existence of Aliens on this planet does NOT mean that they are running the show or that all our leaders are Aliens.In Alice In Wonderland David has presented us with the usual mixture of brilliant ideas and research and theoretical stretches that tend to undermine his overall position. As with many things in this world, the Truth is probably somewhere in between the theorizing and the apparent realities.

Sorry, but I just had to get that out of the way. Dame Di spent her teen years in my home town of Leeds in the UK. Swoon.Emma Peel was an incredibly important female role model at a time when blond bimboes were pouting, being dumb and twisting their ankles while being led by the heroes as they fled from the bad guys.Emma Peel, warrior woman, took on the bad guys, and usually won. Xena: Warrior Princess, played so masterfully by Lucy Lawless - also 5'10&quot;, owes a great deal to Mrs. Peel, who was immortalized by the insanely talented, classically-trained actress, Diana Rigg.I actually loved the black and white episodes - apart from the stories themselves being intriguing, they have an Art House quality about them.Likewise, the color episodes, which are of superior quality, are just as magical in their own way. The Avengers, even down to the score by Laurie Johnson and unmistakable indidental music, was just flawless, with Macnee and Rigg beng every bit as magical and compelling a screen couple as Bogie and Bacall.Absolutely wonderful to have these as a single package. If I recall, the name Emma Peel came from the time when they were trying to develop a female character who would have Man Appeal or M-Appeal... hence Emma Peel.Whatever the reality, in Diana Rigg's Emma Peel, they succeeded mightily. Possibly the most perfect woman who ever walked the Earth.Did I say 'possibly'? Tsk tsk.

Classic Stevie. The Nam-era combat patch alone gives you something of the flavor of this powerful album.Steve actually just missed being drafted (he was born in 1955) as they stopped shipping draftees in 1972. Under the Paris Peace accords, there were massive troop withdrawals, during which many of the Surgical and Evac. Hospitals also pulled out. By April, 1973 it was basically over.Yet Steve's two-tour Vietnam Vet in Copperhead Road has many real-life counterparts. In many ways Copperhead Road is the ultimate rebel song, in which the grass-growing Vet indicates that the lessons he learned from Charlie (Victor Charlie = VC) make him one heck of a threat to the sissy DEA helicopters (just take out the tail rotors).These combat veterans were never honored for their service, and for many reasons, they had an arrest rate of more than twice that of a comparable non Vet. You get the sense that this is Steve's 'what if' song, in that he could see himself being in the same position as the Vet who comes back 'with a brand new plan'.Devil's Right Hand is without a doubt one of his best songs, and one of THE best songs you are ever going to hear. Yeah, very much a post-country album and one that gave the world two songs (the rest are good, too) which stand as true modern classics, and which assure the survival of Steve as an artist to be reckoned with, against all competition.Worth it for the cover alone!

After designing a seven page read-only web site with Netscape Composer (which generates HTML source code) I found that potential Web hosts tended to become twitchy at the prospect of Composer's &quot;inelegant code&quot;. Their concern is that not only would the code not be XHTML compliant (the standard for the future that is being implemented now), but that some of the code simply would not run on some browsers.Swoon... I needed a quick fix book that would explain enough about XML and XHTML for me to go in and manually convert the Composer-generated HTML code for XHTML compliance. I also needed to be able to use a checking tool to verify that the altered/upgraded code would pass the test.Thank goodness for Michael's book. My first bonus was discovering that Netscape 7.1 actually generates HTML 4.1 code, which is basically current. My second bonus was finding that Michael has a very readable style and gets to the point quickly. To be honest, I just speed scanned the vast majority of the book and used it as a reference guide while I dove in almost immediately to perform the XHTML conversion.The way MM explains things, the conversion was a very simple process, and the icing on the cake is that he explains how to use the WC3 Validator online free checking service, which allows you to safely and simply upload your source code for a given web page, and have it checked in real time. One cute bonus from the Validator site is that when your code passes the test, you can download an icon indicating that your code for that page is XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant.I'm sure there are many good books out there of a similar nature, but for me, this book by Michael Morrison works for people who just want to get in there quickly and do it. Like many busy men and women, I don't have time to read War and Peace, and MM appears to understand that need for speed and clarity.Finally, while there is some breezy humor and a very friendly feel to the book, it does not descend into the infantile 2 cent jokes and puns that some books have been known to contain.Excellent.

Welcome To The Cruise is perhaps the most flawless album I have ever heard. While Stay With Me Till Dawn and the utterly exquisite For You may be the songs that people most remember, every track on this album is a certified gem.The brilliance of the songwriting is well complimented by the superb clean production and the wondrous string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster (who I believe did Elton John's Madman Across The Water). Add to this the simply stunning vocals of the incomparable Judie Tzuke and the oh so classy guitar work of the mighty Mike Paxman (check out his solo on the title track) and you have a once in a lifetime album.While Cruise may eclipse Sports Car as a whole, SC contains many classic Tzuke masterpieces, including the devastatingly beautiful Understanding. The track Sports Car is Jude at her most cutting, lyrically speaking. The song is about a pretentious would be if he could be middle class poser, and the great lady's contempt for his shallowness - "Bet you tell stories of wine-loosened ladies and friends of a friend that you used to know..." and finally, the ultimate derision - "I bet you've got a sports car". Classic stuff.If you love solid guitar playing, powerful, fresh original songs and breathtakingly beautiful and utterly distinctive female vocals, this amazing double set represents ridiculous value. Amazon does it again.

I ordered this movie on the strength of reviews by other Amazon members and I was not disappointed. Quite frankly, this is as good as it gets.While I understand how some strict Christian folk might struggle a little with some of the (by modern standards) minor profanities, this version is just dark enough, just rough and tumble enough to convey the magic of the original novel.Anybody who has read Under The Black Flag by David Cordingly - a superbly detailed history of piracy, which I obtained from Amazon.com - will realize that even this movie's depiction of real pirates has been consciously sanitized.Chuck Heston's mastery makes this the ultimate Treasure Island, and the supporting cast was brilliantly selected. The immensely gifted Christian Bale has set a standard for the portrayal of Jim Hawkins that will never be surpassed. Likewise, Oliver Reed and Christopher Lee have used their collective genius to immortalize two characters that might otherwise have vanished from your memory as soon as their parts were over.The remaining cast, including Julian Glover, Clive Wood, Isla Blair and Richard Johnson are all similarly perfect for their parts, and the parcel of rogues who comprise the motley crew could not be more believable.Beautifully filmed in Jamaica, every scene is a rich visual delight, especially the ones shot on and around the superbly-maintained HMS Bounty, which passes for the Hispaniola. This movie has had a lot of very good reviews. There's a reason for that. It's brilliant.

Sorry, that was a Jack Jones title... An invaluable book. I had to get my copy from Amazon UK, but it arrived swiftly and is worth every penny.Anybody who has the double DVD of The Wicker Man, with the interview section, will have some sense of the enormity of the project and the problems that they faced in completing and marketing this classic movie. Allan Brown's superb book obviously goes way beyond that in taking the reader/fan into the very heart of the Wicker Man phenomenon.Everything from the selection of the Locations to the internal politics and squabbling is examined in detail, as is the post-release saga. Brown points out that like any other film, The Wicker Man has its glitches, such as a continuity/editing error in which what appears to be a policeman's leg appears in the cut-to-scene in which the landlord has been left bound and gagged by Howie, in the middle of a later-in-time scene involving the procession. The unknown person's body part enters from the left at the very end of the scene as the camera pans right then left (Use Slow and Step).Similarly, the Fire Dance in which the young women/teenage girls are supposed to be naked was never shot as such because of the restrictions on showing under-aged nudity. So you are left with Summerisle and Howie talking about the children being naked, after a scene in which they are clearly wearing leotards. A ludicrous situation, as the team could have easily used older actresses, which would have been legally and morally acceptable, and the way it was shot, you couldn't tell the age of the actresses anyway.The fact that they didn't re-cast the scene with actual of-age women (the logical choice) is probably symptomatic of the tight schedule that the whole crew was under. This comes across only partially in the DVD documentary, which also barely touches on the conflict between individual team members, some of whom were dissatisfied with Hardy's direction.The book also contains many excellent photos, some of which are stills, others being candid off-camera shots. The Appendices are also very useful, ranging from complete cast and crew lists to Location/Scene charts to script excerpts that never made the movie.Brown also refers to the massive cult following that the movie now enjoys, and to fanzines such as Gail Ashurst's Nuada (she also appears in the interview footage on the DVD). Certainly an essential purchase for the serious Wickerphile.At this time there is a rumour that a Wicker Man re-make is being planned for filming in the States with Nick Cage in the starring role, while Robin Hardy's May Day, starring Christopher Lee should also be filmed this year. All hail the Queen of the May.

They being the five young Americans who went to Vietnam in place of Dick (5 deferments) Cheney. There's absolutely nothing wrong with getting five deferments, unless you subsequently become a politician and send other people's sons and daughters off to war.A book that mocks the overblown and utterly derivative The Da Vinci Code and Dick Cheney at the same time simply has to be worth a read. I managed to force myself through the mind-numbingly predictable TdVC only to discover that it had taken literally all of its ideas from countless books that had been spouting the same 'revelations' for at least two decades. While it is definitely an advantage to have read The Da Vinci Code, I'm sure this book would be highly entertaining even as is.Seriously funny... which is probably an oxymoron. But then, let's leave Rumsfeld out of this.By the way, Mona Lisa means Ra Isis.

This is Rock history, and it just doesn't get any better. As somebody said, there are no highlights in this stunning set. Led Zeppelin was a continuum. It was a total experience and it is senseless to try and break it down.The release of this flawless DVD set around the same time as the equally flawless triple 'live' CD How The West Was Won was almost disorientating to the die-hard Zep fan. Having eventually stopped pinching myself, I play them both as often as I can, and thank Page that we have been blessed with these releases.A few years ago there was a substantial poll in which Led Zeppelin were voted The Greatest Band Of All Time - ahead of even The Beatles. No argument here. If you happen to know any non-believers, just strap 'em into a chair and make them watch this set.Robert's lyrics actually got me into Tolkien and Spenser (The Faerie Queen, above all), and to have this whole lotta Zep at the same time as the conclusion to the absolutely breathtaking Lord Of The Rings trilogy is almost a mystical experience in itself.No, there was never anybody to touch them. Not even close. In my 'humble' opinion, there was nobody worthy of cleaning their shoes. In Tina's words, they were simply the best. I can only hope that the boys will round off this wave of LZ releases by getting together with Jason (the only exceptional drummer with a moral right to sit in his dad's seat) and do a serious tour and album.Sorry folks, I do tend to ramble on...

The intriguing title of Tobias's 'tour guide' captures the feel that fellow Nam combat vet Joe Haldeman also captured in his Sci Fi classic, and Vietnam War allegory, The Forever War.In Joe's novel, the Government back on Earth were so far removed from the deep space battles that were daily occuring many light years away, that the absence of real-time command and control made the war a fiasco for the troops at the end of the line.Likewise, if you talk to any Nam vets, the Vietnam War was being run by a totally out of touch (in every sense) Government that was attempting to run things from 12,000 miles away. The constant and erratic political interference with the tactical situation (Vietnam was never fought as a strategic war until the Linebacker II air campaign in December, 1972) seems to have reminded Tobias of the way the Egyptian Army of old became so remote from the commands of the Pharaoh that their war also felt pointless for the combat soldier in the field.A wonderfully honest book, that examines the war up close, for good or for bad, and which is a welcome addition to the many fine books penned by combat vets and military nurses (please check out Army Nurse Susan O'Neill's magnificent Don't Mean Nothing) that really put you in the middle of war in all of its madness and futility.Bravo.

This is an exceptional album by any standards and ridiculous value.While most of her classics are on here, there are many other tracks that blew me away - such as the ONLY example of the danceable, single version of Chelsea Morning to appear on an album.The other two songs that were a surpsise sensation to me were Judy's own song, Since You've Asked, and her simply breathtaking version of the old whaling song Farewell To Tarwathie. This is made all the more haunting by the presence of whale song from humpback whales, which Judy added in herself, from a tape that came from a marine biologist friend, Dr. Roger Payne.To cap it all, the mini booklet contains wonderful bio info and many stunning shots of this impossibly beautiful woman.Invaluable.

This really is an indispensible album for Buffy fans. I would have bought it anyway, but it actually contains some excellent performances.Sarah certainly holds her own on her numbers, especially Going Through The Motions, and the superb Tony Head and James Marsters deliver very creditable performances - see also Tony's Music For Elevators. However, one major disappointment is that the divine Al Hannigan barely gets in a line.Yet the real revelation is Amber, whose exquisite Under Your Spell is as good a vocal performance as you will ever hear from a female singer. As another reviewer said, we can only hope that she puts out a solo album.While this episode was the shining jewel of Season Six, and a tribute to Joss Whedon's genius, it was one of the few lighter moments in what was a very dark season. If Season Seven goes ahead as planned, we can only hope that it will be a little more uplifting. During Season Six's darkest moments, it seemed that the Buffy series may be on its way out. After the loss of Xena, ST:Voyager, Farscape and Roswell in such a short space of time, the idea of losing Buffy as well would be a bitter blow.Here's hoping for another Musical Buffy in the future.

"If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm any hostility." (Longfellow)Eastwood's masterpiece certainly humanizes the WW II Japanese military in a way that few movies ever have. I would however suggest watching Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Oshima) for an insight into their appalling treatment of Allied prisoners of war, which cannot be ignored.An immensely talented Japanese cast, headed by the superb Watanabe and Ninomiya, bring these characters to life in a way that renders this an unforgettable movie.In a career filled with excellence, this to me is Eastwood's finest hour.Outstanding.

...when you read about the presence of Stalin's thugs at Nuremberg.As you may recall, in 1943, German troops stumbled across mass graves in the forest at Katyn, near Smolensk. They called in forensic experts from a number of countries, including neutral Switzerland, claiming quite rightly, that the Russians had massacred Polish officers and civilians (in May, 1940) - more than 20,000 of them, as it turned out later - yet the US and UK chose to believe Stalin's lies when he blamed the Germans.David Irving's underlying point, that you're only a war criminal if you lose, is well made, over and over again throughout this substantial book.Don't get me wrong, some of the judgements were entirely appropriate, and I'm not a Holocaust denier. Zyklon B WAS the most efficient way to kill large numbers of humans, as it was readily available, easy to transport, and you need infinitely less concentrations to kill people than to kill insects; and it was clearly not merely used for de-lousing. Equally, I totally accept Israel's right to exist, alongside the Palestinians, but I also recognize that there are times when people are blinded by their own self-righteousness.How some of these charges were ever brought is highly questionable, and how Hess, who spent the War under guard in the UK ever ended up as a show prisoner in Spandau, to appease that filthy butcher Stalin (I have Polish friends, so I will not apologize for the strong language), is just one of many mysteries.A Polish friend told me a joke that runs... A Polish soldier has a German coming at him from the left and a Russian from the right. Who does he shoot first? Why, the German, of course. Business before pleasure.To the victor the spoils? To the victor the rules.A very sobering and detailed book. I think David Irving did a fine job. Oops, does that make me a Nazi?
