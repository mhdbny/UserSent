Orwell describes a Negative Utopia, one which Big Brother watches your every move, any inkling of dislike towards the party can get you killed, and even confessions of one's own children can send you to labor camps.The first half paints a scary picture as one man tries to cope with everyday life in this suffocating hell. There are telescreens constantly watching you, people totally dedicated to revising the past to suit the Party, spies out to snitch on you. The main character, through his mundane everyday ordeal, breaks the mold and does something dangerous - buys and writes into a diary. The overall feeling is a common but classic one - one man tries to break out of a confining society. He describes the mood of the world that any man can relate to, being an individual in a world where individuality is not welcome.The second half is the weaker half. It turns from a subtle message to an openly overt message. Instead of the concentrating on one man's perspective, Orwell bombards the reader with mock history and rhetoric, and a last minute confession by the Party itself. That last minute confessions reminds me of how in any badly written movie, the villain suddenly explains his motives and his actions to the hero before he's about to kill him. And like those movies, the motivation is overblown and totally unreal.This book was enjoyable, and the writing was smooth and fluid. The lack of dialogue and action sort of took away from the enjoyment, but not too much. I would recommend this book, but I still think Animal Farm is far superior.

This small book starts off nicely with a "Fireman" name Montag walking down the street. This takes place in the future where books are banned, and fireman set fires to houses with books. It's a world where the government controls everything, and people are content watching television. As Montag walks he encounters a strange girl. A inquisitive teenager who tends to slowly open Montag's eyes to the life that himself and the government has tried to prevent him from seeing.However, the book goes downhill from there. We later learn that the girl died, maybe or maybe not by the government. Then all forms of subtlety are thrown out the window. Montag burns a lady and her house down, but only after picking up a few books. He starts a conversation with a former literature professor, who discusses how the government and people disengaged themselves from the world of literature, and how to change their thinking. The worst part was when his fire chief enters his house and gives the typical bad guy expose to the good guy on what the government is trying to do. This dialogue is extremely forced and contrived and quickly bores the reader along while taking away much of the imagination of the what and why.He later kills that fireman and goes on the run after his house burns down, only to be left in a the countryside as a survivor, and tries to resurrect the world of books and open thinking. This again overtly ties into an over the top message on the good of literature and open-mindedness.For those who value subtlety and imagination, this book is not for you. While I respect and admire Bradbury's plot and perspective, it could have been done in a much more presentable, believable, thought provoking, and by far more engaging way.

A mysterious hound is haunting a family estate, and the new heir has employed Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to investigate the hound, find out the death of his relative, and save the heir's life. Throughout the book, the neighbors, the townspeople, an escaped convict and are all suspects.While not a large book, the Hound of the Baskervilles does trudge along at some points. The someone antiquated language aside, it does delve into more detail and much more build up than a typical Holmes' short story does. So while in a short story, the mystery would be solved in minutes, in this book, the mystery takes a while to come forth. For example, in the beginning there is a mysterious person in a stagecoach following the heir. The mystery is only solved at the end, but with all the other events that took place, the reader has already lost interest in that particular person. I personally forgot about it, thus it did not intrigue me at all.Also, in much of this book, Holmes is not even present. The wit and mystery are substituted with settings and descriptions instead, not Doyle's strongest points.While a classic mystery which is still good, it can come out as somewhat unsatisfying.

This book is less of a sociological study but more of a rant. While some points are valid, I could not help but think the authors just have grudges against certain things. In the latter half of this book, statistics, surveys and valid studies dominate, making it informative, but the beginning is littered with gripes and anecdotal evidence which I feel hurts the credibility of the whole book.The books deals with how American society is on a consuming rampage that is controlling our lives. Somehow, though, they concentrate of the extremes, insert wild exaggerations, and seem oblivious to the fact that the two major factors that take away the most money are taxes and housing. What little meaning they attach to a house is meaningless rants again McMansions, and somehow support the hypocrisy of cheaper housing and more open space.Yes, they bring up some valid points. The environmental information they provide is excellent and an eye-opener. The advertising section was also informative and made think a little harder.All in all, it's good, but in the end it made me that the only way to satisfy the authors of this book would be for everyone to go back in time and become Yeoman farmers, in a magical world where land is cheap and plentiful and government is an efficient system that can solve all of societies woes. It ain't going to happen.

This novel is sort of a combination of a two different novels, one about a trial, and nine years later. It is definitely typical of later Grisham. Predictable, short, but readable.Grisham describes the life of a young man who moves to the south and buys a small county newspaper. The first part deals with a trial of a gruesome murder. The second part deals with a mysterious killer (though who the real killer is insultingly obvious). Along with it, Grisham uses this story to weave in other stories about racial integration, southern style, and families.There is nothing wrong with this book except for the fact that it tries to be all in one and doesn't go into any great depth. Is it a thriller, a social commentary piece, or a law book? It tries to be all three and the result is very ho hum.Definitely better than "The Street Lawyer" or "King of Torts". Doesn't reach the heights of "The Chamber" or "A Painted House."It's a decent read, but very mundane.

Enron's greed and financial scandals, along with the rise and fall, are interesting in itself. This book, though it does explain the fall and is easily readable, isn't intriguing enough to capture the reader's attention. In fact, more than half is a description of how Enron came to be and what there business model is. A chunk of the book is just photocopied evidence pasted in the appendix. Only a minute section describes the scandal and accounting frauds.The author loves anologies. He devotes pages to baseball card trading, and then sort of compares it to Enron's business. While these analogies help with understanding the business model, it's often over-simplified with a glaring lack of details. What I found was a lack of hard numbers and statistics which meant I couldn't put the failings into perspective. Also, the first half of the book where he details Enron, he seems to be praising their business, then hand wavingly, he points to a few corrupted examples. It almost appears that the author thinks Enron would still be a powerhouse if it wasn't for a few specific incidents.As a book, it gets the job done. It shows the errors of Enron in a way that any non financial person could understand. It does tend to oversimplify, and it's glaring lack of numbers and details hurt it in the end.

After reading The Big Sleep, I was weary about picking up another Chandler book. I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books. And yes, that is true in his second book.Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe. Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm. Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre.At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel.

This is an interesting book for people in their twenties. Though taking pop culture references and tying those to societal behavior is nothing new, Klosterman sometimes intelligently places real and intense thoughts about subjects that weren't meant to be dissected socially. He goes into how the Sims, Saved by the Bell, the 80s Lakers-Celtics rivalry all represent or influence society in one form or another. This book contains 18 disjointed, unrelated chapters explaining Klosterman's view of random popular culture phenomenons.The good part about this book is that at some points it's smart and hilarious at the same time. Klosterman's view on Soccer and why neither he nor America will ever accept is worth the price of the book alone. The first half of the book is far superior in that you'll find yourself laughing at loud (like I did on a plane). If you had part of your life influenced by random and useless things like toys or television shows when you were a kid, then this sort of sheds light on how minute items can influence anyone.There are two bad parts about this book though. Since he devotes a chapter to a random idea based on an aspect of culture, you'd be somewhat interested in that aspect. He went on a giant tirade about how classical country music is better than modern Nashville country music. Not only did I not care about that genre of music, I was unaware of the division of classical and modern country, nor did I really want to know about such a division. The worst part of this book is that he does a lot of useless explaining of random facts in detail that really aren't intriguing, funny or interesting, and doesn't incorporate these long winded details to anything noteworthy. In the chapter where he describes religious fanatics, he gives a boring and long summary of a religious movie for almost no reason. The second half of the book is really chalked full of such useless information and provides nothing interesting, funny or thought provoking at all.By the way, there is hardly any mention of Sex, Drugs, or even Cocoa Puffs in this book.All in all, it's interesting and unique, but the latter chapters were so dull that it left a dull taste in my mouth. There were some great chapters, but the inconsistency just makes it an average book at best.

The Belgariad series ends with a fluffed up book. While the finally apocalyptic battle between Garion and Torak is exciting, the end of it is somewhat cheesy. The worst part of the book is the useless fluff written in order to extend the ending into a full-fledged novel.Going into the fifth book, the reader knows that Garion and Torak will fight an epic battle. What the reader shouldn?t have to do is drudge through the micro-management of an army travelling, nor read about how a queen runs a country that has nothing to do with the story anymore. Unfortunately, that?s half the book. Most of the rest of the book is Garion, Silk, and Belgarad travelling. Like usual, they travel, almost face capture or death, and escape. The same sort of thing that happened in the last four books. It seems like Eddings really wanted to extend this series to five books no matter how useless the material was.Other than that, Eddings does retain his readability, and his imagination is as good as ever. I recommend this book, however, as it tidies up the prophecy nicely.

Elvis Cole, LA private inspector, is baby-sitting his girlfriend's son, when all of a sudden the child disappears. Elvis's goal is to find the child, all the while working with tight lipped partner, the LA cops, his girlfriend's ex husband, and many other goons and low-lifes.While not a literary masterpiece, this book is a fun page turner. The action and fluidity is constant, the plot is well conceived, and the stand-offs between Elvis and everyone else keeps things interesting. Though the plot is pretty standard, the unraveling of the plot is magnificent. Crais could have turned the book into a sappy kid story, but instead concentrated on the kidnapping hunt.This is a great page turning read. One of those books where before you know, you've reached the end.

Like the Dune and Foundation series, the Ender book series suffers from drawn out sequels. This book, which finally sums up what should have been summed up in Speaker for the Dead (two books prior), does not capture the imagination or hold the reader's attention as well as the first book in the series. In fact, this book, along with Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide actually does a great disservice to Ender's Game.The book is not too bad though. It finally solves the riddles of the four species (Jane, Piggies, Desaloda, and the Buggers), and moves along at a much better pace than the two previous books. Though the ending is relatively weak, at least the reader won't have to endure more conflicts and problems that Card seems to add on almost page by page. It also tends to stray away from family, philosophical, and religious rants and goes back to the story at hand.If you've read the three previous books, you should definitely finish the series and pick up this book. However, if you're just starting out, start with Ender's Game, and end right there.

Despite everyone knowing the basic plot, the story does enfold into a nice mystery (though not really a horror story). A hideous man, Mr. Hyde, suddenly appears out of nowhere and seems to befriend a likable Dr. Jekyl. Mr. Hyde lives in his residence and enigmatically stays there for long periods of a time. Only later on does his friends and acquaintances find out that Dr. Jekyl is Mr. Hyde.This novella is an engrossing tale of a divided man. This mystery, though already known, is a great tale worthy of being a classic. For a book written over a hundred years ago, it's suprisingly readable, mysterious in the beginning, and exciting at the end. Even the different narratives hightens this tale.I recommend this book. It's a good, short mystery.

Honestly, I didn't enjoy it when I forced to read it in sixth grade. But hey, at that time I found Who's the Boss interesting. Now that I've matured, and reread this book 10 years later, I realize that this book is a true epic battle between courage of a man, and the forces of nature and age.Hemingway's greatest work, this 120 page novella can be easily read in a single sitting. In fact, it's more of a challenge to put it down than to keep reading.On the surface, this book is very touching and exciting - a man struggling to win over great odds. On a deeper level, it's a representation of human courage, survival, and instinct in its greatest form. It is a true multi-dimensional book.In other words, this is greatest novella ever written.

According to many people, this is a classic. Now I won't go that far, but this book introduces us to one of the greatest type of characters - the educated buffoon. I like to refer to it as the first smart-stupid comedy.The first thing I must say is that the readability is quite lacking. The superfluous flowery language, the street vernacular, and the outdated slang make it quite annoying to read at some points. I know that many people say that that is part of its charm. That may be true, but nonetheless, it's not an easy Sunday read.That said, this book is character driven, and Toole really delves into the eccentricities of all characters involved. The plot really revolves on Ignatius Reilly; a master's educated fat doofus with tons of book knowledge, but no social skills whatsoever. A computer nerd way before computers really were popular. A Comic book guy way before the Simpsons. He deals with his mother, his mother's friends, a bad luck cop, a mysterious hipster girl from New York, the owners and employees of a pants factory and a seedy bar all in complex and humorous interminglings.Not only funny, it sheds life on a non-classical dysfunctional family, the city of New Orleans in the past, and a whole lot more. While the humor and insight is entertaining, the fluidity of the novel takes away from a great novel.

Well, I was weary of this game because it's licensed, it's licensed for a series of Transformers cartoons that I have never seen, and it's by Atari. I basically had a free rental and this was the only thing that caught my eye. You know what, despite all that - it turned out to be pretty good.My main gripe is that it's not based on the original Transformers (mid 80s) series, which is really the only Transformers series around in my opinion. Being based on Armada, the only characters that I recognized and that transformed to the same vehicle were Starscream and Optimus Prime. The fans of the mid 80s show are in their twenties now, with tons of disposable income. Where the heck is a decent game for that?Anyway, it turned out to be pretty good. It's a third person shooter basically. You can change into a car, but it's really useless because of the terrain, so the expected blend of driving and third person shooter is really not there. There are about 7 short levels (2 jungles, 2 snow based, 1 outer space, 1 island based, and 1 ship based) that are mostly done linearly, but you can comeback to earlier ones to collect Datacons and Minicons. Datacons unlock extras (movies, etc.), while Minicons are little robots that give a certain power, whether it be extra shielding, regeneration, better weapons or something else. Searching for Minicons can be annoying (I started using a guide in about the second level and beyond), but are worth it because of the improved weaponry. Most of these are optional, but rewards the extra time to find them.There are three difficulty settings and you can play as three different autobots at almost any time (Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, Red Alert). I found the easiest level to be somewhat challenging, especially some of the bosses, so I never ventured into the higher difficulty settings. Constant save points are littered throughout each level, so you'll find yourself rarely repeating fights.The good thing about this game was that I couldn't put it down. I was out one day, and all I could think about was coming back home and destroying Megatron. Even though not spectacular, this game really grabs you. The Minicons add a new dimension to a very standard game, and CGI movies are pretty polished as well. Finally, I got to play Optimus Prime. How cool is that?Now to the bad. The graphics are typical of early PS2 games, and the controls seem kind of jerky. With modern shooters (like TimeSplitters 2 or James Bond's latest), it seems kind of dated. The fact that there really is no driving in the game kind of defeats the purpose of &quot;transforming.&quot; I was pretty frustrated on the second level in easy mode. They could have made a tad easier.All in all, if you're an Armada fan, this is a great game. If you're not, you'll still find it to be decent.Pros:In the end, I could not put it down.Optimus Prime!Minicons enhance abilities.Numerous save points.Cons:It's not the &quot;real&quot; Transformers, so not as fun.Graphics are subpar.Pretty difficult in the beginner level.Hardly ever use the automobile.Controls are kind of clunky.Time to complete (with FAQ guide, easiest level): 12 hoursDifficulty level (easiest level): MediumFrustration level: Medium

TimeSplitters has always been the most fun First Person Shooter series around. Smooth graphics, fun characters, really fast action. TimeSplitters 2 has to be my favorite shooter ever. Needless to say that I was looking forward to this finally being online.Well, the online portion is the reason why this game exists. In terms of how the game looks and plays, it's just like it's predecessor, TimeSplitters 2. This in not a bad thing by any means.So, the first question is, how is the online? It's a mixed bag. When the games are fun and fair, it's amazing. But those times are increasingly becoming few and far between. First off, technically, there is no lag. Playing online is almost as fast as playing against your friend. You can play up to four players on one console, and up to eight in one game (NOT 16 like the preview says!). The games consist of the normal fair: deathmatch, team deathmatch, assault, capture the bag, and more. You can choose something like 10 different levels or use custom made levels. You can join a game, or you can host a game (so you can choose the setup, kick out players, etc.).There a few technical problems though. The first and most obvious is that the headsets don't work over PPPoE. Which is strange because it's pretty standard on many DSL connections, I can't see why it is so technically different than other types of connections. Second is the lack of diagnostics. What I mean by that is that if you're behind a firewall without port forwarding, you'll won't be able to host games. However, it'll still let you set up the game. For the longest time I thought I was unpopular because no one joined my game. The server let me set up the game even though I was not set up to handle it. Finally, the game freezes on many custom maps online. The only way to get around is to reset the PS2 and go through the annoying 5 minute process of getting it back up and online.Now it terms of play, sometimes it's just downright amazing. A properly set up capture the bag in "Training Grounds", or a team deathmatch in "Mexican Mission" is the most amazing game experience around. The kills keep coming. Strategies start developing. You start to recognize tendencies, tend to work in groups, etc. All in all, if those perfect scenarios with the right mix of people are set up correctly, you've got the best gaming experience ever.Notice that I used the word "if"? Well, that's because many people are cheap online, or many people don't know how to setup a game. It's tough to host a non-deathmatch because no one will wait for eight slots to fill up before the game starts. That often leads you to the mercy of the host of another game. Many times, the game will have short characters (monkeys, a little girl). The short characters, being smaller, have a huge, cheap advantage, and their cheapness annoys and aggravates many people. Often times, in custom maps, weapons will be placed in obscure places where only the mapmaker can find them, giving them another cheap advantage. Also, there's camping. The worst offense imaginable (I was doing it by accident when I first started playing). Basically, a person waits for you to respawn with a weak weapon or waits for you to cross a narrow opening, and then shoots you. There is no real way to defend against it if the host doesn't kick them out. This ruins a lot of games. If you look on EA website, they rank the players. I played against 2 of the top 10, and one was guilty of using a monkey, one was camping. EA is rewarding cheap play. Finally, many hosts don't know how to set up a game (e.g. they set it up for camping or they have really boring scenarios or maps). This just makes the whole hit or miss phenomenon of getting the right game even worse. Only about 1 out of every 5 games I join are enjoyable or playable, which caused me to abandon online play after just a few weeks.Other than online, it offers the standard offline fair. There is still the ultra fun offline deathmatches against bots. There is nothing greater than having my friend and I use a split screen fighting off many bots. They also included the greatest level of all, Mexican Mission from the TimeSplitters 2. That is a huge plus. There is the standard story mode. Despite the numerous changes in level backgrounds, I found the latter levels to be uninspiring and boring, with stupid little mini games or escort missions. There is also co-op, but it's the exact same missions as the single player, so if you've played single player, co-op is not that great, and vice versa. Also, there are challenges which are just a bunch of little scenarios. Shoot a bunch of zombie monkeys, time yourself as you throw bricks through windows, race a car shaped like a cat around walls to get the best time. Just a whole bunch of things that seemed sort of tacked on. I played a few before I quickly got bored.All in all, the online flaws prove too frustrating and take away from a really great game. If you're not playing online, you can easily purchase TimeSplitters 2 and have the same great experience for about one-fourth the price.Pros:No lag time onlineBest engine aroundMexican Mission!When it's setup correctly, boy is it funCons:Campers and monkeys onlineMostly boring online matchesTechnical online problemsBoring, uninspired story missionsArcade mini-games just seem lameTime to complete: 7 hours (single player or co-op story mode)Frustration: Low (on normal)Difficulty: Low (on normal)

If there is one word to describe this book, it's wow. This book is intriguing, eye-opening, exciting, touching, and mesmerizing. One of the best books I've ever read.Billy McQueen, ATF agent, joins the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang as Billy St. Jean, giving up his personal life, living in certain danger, and even fighting ATF bureaucracy in order to prosecute the toughest and dangerous motorcycle gang around (the only gang to humble the Hell's Angels).This has all the qualities and excitement of any action movie. What separates this from a movie is that this was all real. The sacrifices this man made are amazing.He details the pain of initiation, the side stepping of the issue of drug taking, the constant harassment of the police, the constant threat of being outed, and climbing the ladder of the Mongol hierarchy. He delves the life of Mongol outlaw, the surprisingly strict Mongol organizational structure, the violent crimes they initiate, their history, their significance, their rituals.He transforms the reader, as he explains his own transformation, to a full-fledged Mongol officer. He shows the extremely volatile, yet sometimes sympathetic nature of being in a motorcycle gang. He both explains the dichotomy of people who both love Mongol Billy St. Jean, but would not hesitate to kill ATF agent Billy McQueen. He personally tells of the bonds he formed with some of the members. One could tell the pain he experienced in prosecuting his fellow gang-members at the end of the book.This is truly one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read - one I could not put down.

There are many people who describe the original Dune series as a great work of art and literature, and should not be altered at all. I am not one of those. I found the latter books of the series to be some of the worst books I have ever read. I actually found the prequels to be entertaining as well.One main problem I had with the three prequels written previously was that they really shouldn't have been written. Though I enjoyed them, they had that profit-taking tinge to it. This series, however, needed to be written. Throughout the whole series, there were constant, constant references to the Butlerian Jihad. This jihad seemed to define a big chunk of the Dune, and for me, was a constant source of wonder.This book starts off this new series by describing the beginning of an epic war between robots and humans. Not only does it help define this struggle, the elements of the dune series begin to develop. The origins of Mentats, Bene Gessarit, Spice, Fremen, Wormriding, the animosity between Harkonnen and Artriedes, and what happened to Earth, are all started here. It's a great way to understand and appreciate the original Dune.This book revolves around Xavier Harkonnen and Serena Butler. In an interesting and likeable twist, Harkonnen is considered a great hero, and serves humanity, while Vorian Artriedes starts off as evil person bent on destroying humanity. This books describes and chronicles three different sets of planets. The computer controlled planets, the aligned planets fighting them, and the unalighned planets of humans. This describes the origins of the computer "Evermind" that controls the robot planets, and the cymeks (human brains, robotic bodies) who work under it. It then starts off with battles. Though the dialogue between robots and other robots is a bit weird, and the start of the revolution is a bit contrived, it still does not take away from the action filled and very informative nature of this book.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who felt cheated with Frank Herbert's last four Dune novels and his philosophical rants, and wanted to return to the world of Dune. This books if fun and a true page-turner.

It's a pretty basic fact, either you liked the prequels of Dune, or you did not. I was one of those that really enjoyed the first prequel of the original series but was disappointed with the second book of the original prequel series. This book, the second book of the Butlerian Jihad, is slightly disappointing, but the latter half of the book is where it shines.The first 400 pages, nothing happens. Nope, nothing, nada. Every other page either paraphrases the Eramus killing Serena's baby, and the other page describes how people react to the killing of the baby. By page 200, I almost gave up. The only reason why I continued was that I've read all the other Dune books, and I just couldn't stop. It was beyond tedious, beyond repetitive. I guess they got paid by the page or something.Only at about page 400 (it's a 700-page book) does the action pick up. Fortunately, the plot moves swiftly and in interesting directions. This is where I regained my interest, and I now look forward to third book. Without giving too much away, there are battles, a few surprises, interesting action, great plot twists, and some character changes.Unfortunately, the only thing that spoiled the last 300 pages was the fact that almost everyone or everything was black and white, either unbelievably great, or truly evil. This is lack of depth was almost insulting.All in all, it was decent. With proper editing, it could have been as good as the first book of the series.

Why does Tom Clancy owe me twelve dollars? Because the editor could have eliminated the first 700 pages of this 1028 page book, and it could have been a pretty darn good book. Since 70 percent of the book was useless, I feel that I should have only paid approximately 30 percent of the purchase price. So Tom, feel free to wire me the money as soon as you can, with interest of course.Anyways, besides wasting hours of my time, this book is borderline racist. Clancy often compares the Chinese to Klingons, and is littered with the word Chink. Even though these references somewhat fit in context, it could have been left out without hurting this book.Another reason that why I didn't like this book was that in some aspects, it was too unreal. Do Russians constantly talk about World War II in every other conversation? Is every single Chinese cop and soldier a complete idiot?Finally, this book annoyed me. Clancy switches between people, and refers to them in the stupidest ways. It took me some time to realize that Jack Ryan, the President, was also code-named POTUS (President of the United States). Also, there were numerous references to former Clancy books. If you haven't read some of his other books, you could be like me and wonder if you've missed something. Also, he loves into to go to technical details about weapons or software that just detract from the story. I'm so sick of seeing military weapon names: AWACS, F-22s, any letter-any number, etc. I found myself thinking that I'm reading a manual. Basically, this books lacks fluidity and readability.If you like a good story with interesting characters and international flavor, I suggest reading a James Clavell novel instead.

The last two current Dune trilogies are much more beach novels than the hardcore philosophical based science fiction of Frank Herbert's Dune. This is fine by me, and I think once you can get over it and accept it for something completely different, then you can enjoy it (note - I understand people who can't read it - I love Asimov's Foundation series, but I can't stand the prequels). So, assuming that you've read the other two novels in the Butlerian Jihad series, then you'll get what you expected out of this finale.First off, the main problem is the structure of the book. Each chapter is something like four pages and each one deals with a different subplot. Fine - except for the fact that the story will be built up, then you won't hear anything about that story for another thirty pages. By the time you get back to that part of story, you really don't care anymore.This is made worse by the fact that pages 250-500 are really dull as you have to wait for the inevitable conclusion by dealing with random people or plots that you really can't care about.The book suffers from some horrible structure and waiting that just makes it a pain to read.There are also some problems with whole Robots torturing people or arguing with each other, along with other things that just make no sense.Now for the good stuff (skip this paragraph if you want to avoid possible spoilers). You get the final battles that you wanted. You get to see the beginning of Atriedes - Harkonnen feud. You get the first Space Guild Navigator. You get to witness the start of Bene Gesserit. You get to see that start of the Suk doctors. You get the beginning of the Corrino dynasty. You get to see the first Mentat. All in all, this is what I wanted all along. You've heard about these topics from the original Dune novels, and it's really satisfying to know the origins. I guess the only problem I had with it was that everything was wrapped up too conveniently.Also, the writing style of the authors is fluid and interesting, and if they could have just structured it better, would have made for a book that would have been impossible to put down.So, if you want to know more about the Dune elements and don't have the "this is not Frank Herbert" hang ups, this is your book.

This book is a great journal of a marginal player for an expansion baseball team. It has got great stories, great gossip, emotional ups and downs, and is an insightful read.I, being so young (meaning desensitized by today's culture), I found nothing truly shocking. Though it must have been pretty ground shaking in 1970, it's tamer than I thought it would be.It's a good book and granted it was the start of the trend that exposes athletes and heroes and mere humans, but if it was released today, most people would not have given it a second thought.

Ah, a book with cockfights, a true cowboy in LA, and the original Homer Simpson. This book, while not overtly outrageous, it shows scenes of the eccentric life of a few fringe people in Hollywood.Throughout this book, unique characters are introduced and their lives are showed in the most interesting ways. From a lonely man who takes in a woman, to the woman who ruthlessly takes advantage of him, to the woman's father, who tirelessly wants to entertain. A mix of failures, this book portrays a truer Hollywood, where success and glamour are very limited, but where mental diversity is everywhere.While it does do a good job of showing people and situations, the sentence structure is not too fluid. Sometimes a paragraph or two may have to be re-read. Also, this book does not have much cohesiveness to it. With no plot, and no central theme, the book drifts from one scene to the next. Because of this, it's very hard to be captivated. By all means, this is not a page-turner.For those interested in books about people, I would recommend this book. For those looking for insight or story, I would suggest passing up this book.

This has got to be one of the most intriguing non-fiction books of all time. It's basically how a group of MIT students combine together and take millions from major Casinos. Using team play, sound probability, expert training, and skill, they do the impossible and create havoc for the Casinos, and later themselves.This book describes it all, and yes, it's better than any made up story a fiction writer could produce. Mezrich describes how Kevin Lewis became involved in what later became a lifestyle of glamor, big money, and even woman. Kevin goes from a geeky swimmer at MIT to a big player winning big money.Mezrich knows how to weave the story. First he discusses the introduction, then the frightening orientation. He delves into the mathematics, the strategy, and how the teammates fit into what character roles. He shows how intricate the team aspect of blackjack works, and how they capitilized on it. Both seedy and genious, it sheds a whole new life on blackjack and casino gambling.After that, he then starts showing how Casinos work, especially how they treat you when you're a big player versus when you're a card counter. Without giving too much away, this story not only deals with the winning, but also with the repercussions. Mezrich brings into the lifestyle, not only with the glamor, but also the suspense and terror that accompanies it.This books is one of those few books that you cannot put down. It's a great story and most importunely, a great eye-opener. To top it off, it's all true.No one who reads this will be able to gamble the same way again. No exaggeration. Just pick up this book. I bet you can't put it down (terrible pun intended).

This small book is a great introduction to economics in a non text book format. The author's language is fluid and readable, not like a boring, stuffy textbook. He discusses everything from trade, inflation, fed rates, and the role of government. Sometimes informative, this book assumes hardly any economic knowledge from the reader, so it's really a beginner's book to economics. Anyone who took a simple economics course would probably not need to read big chunks of this.Even though simplistic, it is a quick and fun read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get in on the ground floor. In the realm of few non-academic economics book, this book is probably the best. For example, it's definitely better than "The Armchair Economist".

A pompous director comes to Elvis Cole's office searching for his estranged wife and kid. Elvis, with his usual cool sarcastic reception, reluctantly takes the assignment and traces her to the New England. What ensues is a violent conflict between her, the director, and more importantly, the mob.The sarcastic Elvis and stoic Joe Pike continue their adventures in this missing person's case. In order to throw some new thrills into their escapades, they escape Southern California. This results in terribly predictable characters. The evil ultra violent mobster and his cool tough bodyguard versus the egotistically Hollywood heavyweight and the headstrong single mother.This book suffers and benefits from the usual Crais fare. Sometimes useless descriptions mixed with some repetition. However, it is readable and enjoyable at the most basic level.While not the worst in the series, it really doesn?t offer much. I?d recommend the next two in the series instead.

In this second, and probably the weakest Elvis Cole novel, Crais seemed to spew a book out without any thought. Instead of a well thought out novel, Crais spends needless time on pointless details and intermingles random sarcastic thoughts that only seem to slow down the book to a crawl.The book starts off well with Elvis in charge of finding a priceless Japanese book. Then the book just moves to the absurd, with a flashy nightclub, family incest, and a strange cult spliced together to form some sore of plot. The worst part is the detail that takes away from the weak plot. A prime example is a four-page interlude where Crais describes a man drinking coffee and how a room is arranged. Worst of all, the coffee and the room mean absolutely nothing to the book. Approximately ten percent of the book is devoted to what the detectives eat.Crais tries to save this book with sarcasm. Of course when every other page contains a supposedly witty remark, the lines get tired and old after a while.Unless you plan to read all the Elvis Cole novels, it'd be best to skip this one.

John Grisham can weave a great story, but sometimes he just feels like regurgitating the same tired formula. An underdog, poor lawyer goes through some life changing thing, fights off some highly paid unstoppable law office, struggles a bit, but in the end finds out true happiness. This book isn't really that different from the rest. While not as obvious or black and white as The Street Lawyer, it definitely doesn't compare to the Rainmaker, the Chamber, or his non-law books like a Painted House or Skipping Chirstmas.This time the young lawyer is a young district attorney who stumbles onto a case where he meets a mysterious man who leads him into a mass tort litigation. After leaving his girlfriend of many years, he quickly becomes entangled in the rich mega lawyer lifestyle of mass tort firms. He changes from a man who cares little about money to a money hungry lawyer who has a trophy wife and plane.Of course, anyone can predict how the whole thing would end, so there is no big surprise. Grisham continues his predictable formula once again. Though not really bad, it's nothing great. At times enlightening, it's mostly made so anyone can quickly breeze through it. As usual, Grisham remains fluid and doesn't get sidetracked or bogged down in annoying or useless details.A decent book, but a somewhat bad one for Grisham.

When the first True Crime came out, it was the first real competition for the GTA series, and it was pretty good. Technically, this is a slight downgrade though. By trying to recreate the New York city feel, it becomes too bogged down and too slow.Basically, it's like all the city immersive games out there. Nothing really new. Again, like the first True Crime, the streets are real, but the buildings and scenery are just generic. Speaking of generic, you start off with a horrible cliched storyline. The same one sided characters and cheesy dialogue that has plagued every game that has anything to do with crime. So, I tried to get into it, but after ten minutes of pure unadulterated boredom, I just stopped caring and skipped all the FMVs.The gameplay itself is decent. Nothing great, but very playable. If you don't want to get involved or frustrated (like what is required for GTA: San Andreas), this game is perfect. Driving is annoying, but after you discover the Subway and Taxis, you can move throughout the city with very little driving at all. This leads to the missions. The missions themselves are indoor third person shooting missions. Nothing complicated here. L2 to auto-aim, and shoot. They tried to add stealth, but it's absolutely pointless to try. That's about it for the major missions.There are some minor flaws, like one example would be if you don't have the proper weapon (happened to me twice), you can't leave the mission to get that weapon. You have to reload and sometimes repeat a couple of missions to get to where you need to be. Also, selecting and picking up guns is not quite correct. For example, you'll pick up a carbine, but when the ammo is done, it will sometimes bring you to the stun gun. Valuable seconds are wasted switching to your .38 (which is the only weapon with unlimited ammo).There are side missions that you can do (the major missions only yield 25% completion rate), they've eliminated the need for extraneous and useless combos, and even though some missions seem to drag on, it's nothing like the half hour borefests for the "Dragon" missions in True Crime: Streets of LA.Finally, people say there are tons of bugs. I haven't see any except for the slow frame rate. Heck, GTA: Vice City and Prince of Persia: Warriors Within had a lot of bugs that were easily identifiable. If there are major bugs in this game, I didn't see them.The game looks a little dated, and there is really nothing new except for the Subway and Cabs, but it's fun, never frustrating, and a good solid rental.Pros:Actual streets of New York.Not frustrating at all.Taxis and Subways rule!Don't have to learn combos.Cons:Cliched story.Dullest beginning ever.Driving is a chore.Framerate problems.Some missions get really dull.Frustration Level: LowDifficulty Level: LowHours to Complete: 10 hours (major missions only)

Gun is not a huge game, it's not a very unique game, and it's not really that noteworthy. It is, however, very fun. Like most people, I had no idea what this game was, because the only thing commercials showed were the cut scenes. I wondered why were they hiding the game play? I don't care about some Hollywood reject making his pixelated story, I want to play.So, I gave it a chance by renting it, and it was pretty darn good. You're in western area, reminiscent of HBO's Deadwood. You travel town by town, participating in gun and horse fights with Native Americans and Cowboys alike. You also have side missions, like the Pony express, hunting a wanted criminal, playing poker, or stopping crime. The game play is neither frustrating, unintuitive, nor gimmicky. It's basically a third person shooter where you can also ride on a horse.Despite my hatred of cut-scenes, the videos in this game provide the perfect compliment. Neither too long or too "artsy", they give proper reason and explanation as to what mission you are on.The main complaint I hear from people is that it's not very long. Technically, that's not quite right. There is not much repetition. So, while the game only takes 10 hours for the story missions to be completed, about 8 hours is original gameplay. Most 15 hour games only really have 7-8 hours of original gameplay. Gun is actually nice enough to not let you repeat the same stuff over and over again.If you want a fun game to play, then this is really the best choice out there.Pros:Fun gameplayFMV and gameplay mixed in wellCons:Not very originalNot much to exploreDifficulty: Low (easy level).Frustration Level: LowHours to Complete: 12 hours (including some side missions)

Let me get this straight. Not only do I get the second greatest console out there, behind the PS2, but I also get four classic Zelda games for less than $100? Wow.This is a great bundle. The only thing needed is a memory card, and you're good to go. I love video games, so it's safe to say I own the PS2. I also work in the computer industry and consider myself socially and economically responsible and care about the future of video gaming. so it's safe to say I do not and will never own an Xbox. Given this, this is the only other console, and though limited in games, it is just a superb deal. It's hard not to pass this up.The console is excellent when it comes to specs. It looks pretty damn snazzy too. The controller, in my opinion, is the best one out there. It's comfortable for the wrist, fits neatly in your hand, and is ergonomically placed buttons never fail.Then there are the games itself. The bonus disc contains the two NES Zelda games, and the two N64 Zelda games (it does not include the SNES Zelda game though). This provides hours of entertainment, and the games are regarded as some of the best games ever. For free, this is not bad at all. There is also a Zelda playable demo, and some extra Zelda features on the disc as well.Once you have the system, there are numerous, highly touted games available. Renting games for the Gamecube is much nicer because it's owned by less people, so your video store will mostly have the games you want when you want them. Also, the Gamecube has the best kids games out there, along with more mature, exclusive games. Metroid Prime, the Sonic games, and Mario Double Dash are all exclusive to this system. The only thing missing is online play, but for this price, who cares?I advise getting a simple starter kit (memory card, extra controller, extension cord) for a nominal price, and you've got the best value in video game.

Simon Singh can describe tails of drama, history, and common mathematical sense into a great book. While most people take cryptography for granted, Singh provides historical and simple examples to illustrate it's importance to mathematics and history. He details it's use in wars, especially World War 2, and commerce. He even delves into the political ramifications of strong versus weak encryption when discussing PGP.Singh also provides easy to understand ways on how encryption works and even more intriguing, how to break it. He shows how all various encryption algorithms are done, and then how code breakers can decipher them, both in practical and historical consequences.In the end, he even provides a challenge for would be decipherers out there. Granted, it's already been solved, it's still education and exciting that he offered a considerable amount of money for this challenge ($15000).All in all, it's a fascinating book that will capture anyone's imagination, even if they hate history or math.

Written in a journal form of various character, it chronicles Dracula, the vampire from Romania, venturing into London. The first 100 pages of the book are mesmerizing, the journal of Jonathan Harker traveling and staying in Dracula's castle is amazing. The fear, the dread, the sinister Count and elegant prose all add to feel of a great horror novel.Then the rest of the book comes along. What once was a horror movie becomes pure Victorian drivel, with laughably divination for the two females, Lucy and Mina, that not only destroys the readability with the extreme flowery nature of their banalities, but detracts from the true horror that Stoker brings about in the first 100 pages.The last fifty pages are interesting, as they are on the quest to destroy Dracula, but the drudgery of language and the previous 300 pages destroy all hope of enjoying this book.

After I started reading Cain, specifically Double Indemnity, I decided that I should brush up on good ole' American detective novels. Chandler, no doubt, is considered to amongst the Pantheon of American detective writers.The Big Sleep is the first novel by Cain. I admire the gritty Los Angeles of the 1930s that Cain presents. His main character, Marlowe, is a tough yet sarcastic detective whose off to solve a blackmail problem for a certain wealthy family. Marlowe then gets involved with Murder, more blackmail, organized crime, and more.There are quite a few good things about this novel. The way he describes Los Angeles is both pertinent to the novel, and fun to read by itself. The snappy one liners and tough guy attitude both presents a noir type image for Marlowe, while allowing for humor. The characters, though outlandish, are indeed interesting and add to depth of the novel.There were some problems that I just couldn't get past though. First and foremost is the lack of continuity and fluidity. Chandler places a lot of emphasis on descriptions of buildings and atmosphere. While adding to the novel in some aspects, it bogs down the reader in many other aspects. It's also a pretty hard to follow book for today's reader. I'm not sure if it's his unique writing style that hasn't quite been developed, if the reader expected something different in the 30s, the language and colloquialisms have changed, or a combination of all of the above. Often times I found myself re-reading a few paragraphs and still being a bit confused about the exact situation.Finally, the book just kind of gets out there. It goes from blackmail to some murder with pornographers, to nude photographs, and casinos and such. With the fluidity and difficulty in reading this book, it magnified the lack of realism and outlandishness that I wouldn't really expect from a realistic detective novel.All in all, I admire the book, but I can't really say I enjoyed it.

It's a shame that such an original game could be released with no fanfare. This is a plain good game. It has many numerous flaws, and isn't exciting at all, but it's original and the best puzzle game ever made. Ico, a little boy trapped in a castle, finds a girl and tries to escape. In order to do it, Ico must solve puzzles to move room to room while fighting spirits trying to kidnap the girl.I'll start with the negatives. It's a slow, tedious game. Even when you know what to do, to walk there is a chore, especially dragging the girl around with you. The spirits can't even kill you, but they take forever to be killed. There are also minor problems like some camera angles, trouble doing simple things like lighting and throwing bombs, and so forth, and some parts of the game where you don't even no where to go to progress. Sometimes a blessings, sometimes a curse, but there is very little music in the huge cavernous castle, adding a feeling of loneliness and possible dullness to the game.To start off with the positives, the most noticeable thing are the graphics. The best way to describe it is epic. You actually feel like you're in a castle, despite the monotony of it all. The scenes where sunlight shines on the castle are spectacular. Secondly, it's a great puzzle game. Not too complex and pretty intuitive. Sometimes you'll be stuck, but you can usually find a way, or if you're just renting it, you could just peek at a walkthrough.Pros:GorgeousJust the right difficulty levelOriginalCons:TediousSlow pacedTime: 15 hours (slight walkthrough help)Difficulty: MediumFrustration: Medium

A plane crashes, a company fights for survival, the Unions are mad, and a woman tries to solve it all. Only Crichton could construct this novel. Taking a perfectly plausible idea, and turning it into an action and information packed page-turner.Its apparent Crichton has two things going for him - he can write fluidity, and he can write informatively. He brings the user to world of aviation without confusing or boring the reader. More importantly, he can do it while incorporating it into excitement and intrigue of the plot. This is classic Crichton.This is a great, though non-typical mystery. It's not a who done it, but why it happened mystery. This book is not all great however. It is, after all, a book revolving around the aftermath of an airplane crash in an aviation company. The ending is a little unsatisfying, the main character evokes no feeling, and the aggressiveness of the Unions is not too believable.It's a very good book, but it's not in the class of Sphere or The Great Train Robbery.

Schlosser, the author of the recently famous Fast Food Nation, follows up with another, though less than stellar, piece of social commentary. This time, however, he splices this shorter book into three different, partially related topics. One is about marijuana, the other is about migrant farm workers, and the last part is about the porn industry.All three sections explain the history, the social injustices, and the current state of those particular topics. With three different section, Schlosser fails to go in depth into some of the major issues. While not a flaw in itself, sometimes the information could have been more statistical or insightful.The first section is the best. He describes the continuing and perhaps fruitless effort of America's political system to stop the spread of weed. Though mostly anecdotal, he does open eyes to the unequal and baffling judicial and legislative steps to stop this so called problem.The second part of the book mainly concerns migrant strawberry workers from Mexico. Though informative, I think he fails to reveal why such a system continues to thrive. While describing their living conditions, there is little mention of the &#65533;Not in my Backyard&#65533; movement,, and no mention of California's proposition 13. When he discusses there working conditions, he fails to fully explain the proposed guest worker program, nor does he provide statistics that could shed some more light on the subject.The last part, about the porn industry, is terrible. While most of the book is dedicated to high level issues and concerns, he basis this story on a porn distributor's legal dilemma in painfully boring detail. It seems like Schlosser really was obsessed with someone who wasn't that interesting. Schlosser goes into agonizing details - like literally giving the life story of the guy who eventually examined the porn distributor's taxes.This book is a quick read, but this leaves the impression of quick book of unrelated information tied together in order to capitalize on the buzz of the author's previous book.

My expectations of this book were perhaps mislead. I thought that this would deal with more the generalized view of Wall Street. However, it really concentrates on the lives of traders.Lewis does shed some light on Wall Street trading in general, including a good description of mortgage trading and junk bond trading. However, this book sort of throws it into the mix. I wasn't sure what Lewis was trying to do. Sometimes it felt like a history book, sometimes a biography, sometimes an economics lesson, sometimes a comedy. It felt haphazard and lacked direction, and with the writing style presented, it lacked a certain amount of fluidity.It was fun to learn the different people in Wall Street. From the obese, abusive traders, the short sighted and greedy executives, the brown nosers, to the "back row" trainees. It's basically a fun little description of office life at Solomon Brothers in the eighties, not an exciting expose on the finance industry as the cover would like you to believe.

I've read two other previous books by Hemingway. Feel free to read those reviews as well. In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works.

A little flying saucer lands in a small city in England. What turns out to be a mere curiosity turns into a full-scale invasion. Told from the story of one man, who survived this whole ordeal, this story reveals the Martians, the attempts to subdue the Martians, and the reaction of the human species.What is most marvelous about this book is that it was written in 1898, but with only a few minor modifications, you could have said it was written in 2002. The language is suprisingly modern, the plot is still as interesting as ever, and the human aspects of this book still resonate today.What impressed me about this book is that the events unfold through the eyes of one man. We, the readers, uncover the mysteries and horrors of the aliens as he does. We get to see the large the curious onlookers, the scared masses, the insane lonely man, the giant tripod machines scrounging around looking to kill, and the battles between human and alien. We feel his terror and awe as any man would during that crisis. This book isn't a timepiece, it isn't a love story, it concentrates on action, mystery, and suspense.It's a classic tale that Hollywood and other writers have borrowed upon time and time again. Unfortunately, none of the copies could stand up to this original.I would highly recommend this book, if just to see how an 1898 action book could entertain anyone today.

There is always a tough mental block when reading a book that is really outdated. This book deals with a doctor connected to a death through an illegal abortion. A small portion of this book deals with why abortions should be legal, and why there should be pity towards the doctors that perform illegal abortions. Of course, in today?s time, abortions are legal and the point becomes deadened quite a bit.In this book a doctor is accused of killing a woman through an abortion. Another doctor tries to clear his friend by investigating the case thoroughly. Without giving too much away, this book details how the doctor investigates the woman and her well connected family through interviews, spying, medical records, and autopsies.While it is a good mystery novel, Crichton doesn?t deliver his normal brilliance. Unlike the Great Train Robbery, the reader is not totally immersed in the setting. Unlike Sphere, the reader doesn?t get trapped in the suspense and mystery of the situation.A good, quick, and mildly exciting read, it?s out of date and not up to the extremely high standards that I expect from Michael Crichton.

Wells' imagination is almost scary. Despite being written over one hundred years ago, Wells presents a tale chilling and relevant to this day. A great story in it's own right, it delves deeper into human technological and biology conflicts that have only intensified in recent years. With the onset of cloning, gene therapy, and genetic modifications, the issues spark debate to this day.It starts off with Pendrick, shipwrecked, eventually arriving on the Island of Dr. Mareau and discovering strange beasts. These strange beasts were not natural though, but instead modified animals made up to look and act like humans. Without giving away the plot, the book then moves into action, while moving into such themes as insanity, animals versus humans, and the existence and treatment of god.This book works as a simple fun filled novel with intrigue, suspense and action. It's strange to have a book of such magnitude provide so much simple enjoyment. Even without the deep literary and social meanings, this book stands out by itself. The only flaw is the somewhat antiquated language.Of course, as a sort of added bonus, the insights and issues brought up provide a great addition. Such a book could easily be debated in literary and scientific circles. If such a book was used in my English classes, as opposed to such crud and Faulkner and Jane Austin, I might have actually enjoyed class.The Island of Dr. Maruea is the best mixture of plot and intellectual enjoyment I read since Animal Farm.

I've watch hundreds, perhaps thousands of movies in my life. I only own one DVD though, and this is it. Don't let the previews or commercials fool you. They show some of the worst parts of the movie. Despite being a very stupid movie, it's also one of the most creative, original, and just plain funny movies ever made.Half this movie is not original, but is taken directly from an old 1970s Hong Kong Film. What better way to spoof an old martial arts films then to actually use the film itself. Using modern technology, the main character, the Chosen One, is inserted into the old film, replacing the original main star. Then the whole movie is dubbed. Let me just say that those voices are the most hilarious voices ever. For anyone who has watched old Kung Fu films and made fun of them (especially the dubbing), or any fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, this movie is great.The characters are enjoyable, especially the dreaded enemy, Master Tang, or as he likes to be called, Betty, or Wimp Lo, a young fighter who was trained wrong as a joke.The DVD extras are great. The cut scenes are funny, but the alternative audio tracks are hilarious. The commentary gives a glimpse of the comic genius that created this film. There is also the Book on Tape track, where only one British guy, in the an extremely proper accent, dubs the whole movie itself. Finally, there is the what they were really saying track, where the actors, in order to preserve the bad dubbing quality of the 70s films speak entirely different lines than what is actually dubbed. Pretty darn funny.If you appreciate creativity, originality, and a funny, stupid movie, you have to check this DVD out.

I've lived in the Bay Area for 7 years now, and I never thought of it as anything but and urban and suburban mesh. I wanted to start hiking, but I felt that I needed to travel to national parks far away to enjoy it. I was really mistaken. This book is beyond amazing.I'm not going to say this is the bible of hiking, but whenever I open it, a beacon of light shines upon it and the air is filled with cathedral like chanting.I was totally unaware of the natural beauty and ambience that was located locally. Some of these places described are amazing. I went on all the strenuous hikes described in this book, and I enjoyed each one. From redwoods, to waterfalls, to beaches, to mountain vistas, it's all there.The author provides ratings, directions, description, difficulty, approximate times, pricing, and weather information for each hike. If it weren't for these descriptions, I would never have seen the huge redwoods in the peninsula or the amazing beach and postcard views at Point Reyes.There are only a few minor flaws in this book. The strenuous hikes are pretty easy for anyone is shape, and only take about 3/4ths the time suggested. The directions are sometimes a bit bare, but I never was really lost so it's not too much of a problem.If you want to enjoy the outdoors, no matter what fitness level, get this book. It's everything you need to have many nice enjoyable day hikes.

When trudging through the last three books of the Dune series, the only thing that I wished for was the end the of all this philisophical mumbo jumbo. What about the action, character development, and the whole new world presented to us in the first Dune book? Well, this book is everything I wished for and more.Initially, I was a little weary of this book because it was prequel. I later found out that this book exemplifies what a prequel should be. All those great characters, groups, and kingdoms from Dune are in here. It's a great novel in and of itself, but it re-energized my interest in the Dune series as well.This book is very, very, fluid; unlike Frank Herbert's writing style. Also, it's just bursting with action, interesting characters, and very interesting plots and sub-plots. The story of Duncan Idaho is worth the hardcover price alone!If you have read Dune, I highly recommend this book. If you've read the whole series, you MUST read this book.

This is an interesting look at Africa. Conrad, based on his own experiences, describes Africa as an educated European would at the beginning of the century.Unfortunately, it tends to portray Africans as savages, but it also shows the follies of Europeans dealing with them as if they were savages. If this book were written in today's time, it would probably be considered racist. Fortunately, that was not the intent. It actually portrayed the Europeans as racists, elitists, and greedy. It's an evenhanded book in its portrayals, but both sides are not treated kindlyThe main point of this book is not a description of Africans, or Europeans, but of how the actually placement of one's self could affect someone's mind. All throughout the book, Marlowe, the main character, wishes to meet up with the legendary Kurtz. When he finally meets him, he discovers the insanity that a place like this could have on someone of such high stature as Kurtz. It's highly reminiscent of Apocalypse Now.Besides the unfortunate portrayal of Africans, the biggest grudge I have against this book is its language. It takes about 50 pages to get the feel of his writing, but this book is only 96 pages long.Though the language is rough, I would recommend this book. Conrad describes the jungle unlike any author I can think of.

While the second book of the first Dune prequel trilogy trudged along trying to build up suspense, the first book set the stage and was far better. The third book, though inferiour to the first, concludes the set up and end the trilogy's side stories. While interesting, it still suffer from what all prequels suffer from. We know what happens.I enjoyed the sub plots, the fact that each characters actions will have huge ramifications later on.

This game should have been great. The graphics are there, the playability is there, the concept is there, and the originality is there. ... What I wouldn't give to have a day with the source code. A few little tweaks, and you've got a four star game. Too bad.This game is tough, but more importantly, it's annoying. I realized that they were some serious issues with this game when I had to do the first stunt ten times. First off, there is no walkthrough of the stunt. You have to emulate a series of stunts, and they won't tell you what's next in the series until just when you're about to execute it. This meant that you'd probably not have the right speed or angle going into the next part stunt. That's not too bad. What's worse is that the timing and accuracy have to be perfect for many stunts. If you mess up a little bit, you run out of time and have got to start the mission again.There are six movies to complete, each with about three to six series of stunts to accomplish. About half way through the second movie, when I went through a stunt 30 times, I realized that this was a waste of my time and energy. There were more worthwhile things to do with my life - like watching grass grow, voting for third party candidates, evolving, watching Behind the Music of M.C. Hammer for the 42nd time - anything but this game was more worthwhile.....In short - avoid this game. I only rented it, hoping to capture the essence of Grand Theft Auto 3, and I still felt ripped off.

This book is a journal of Anthony Bourdain's travels across to try new foods. He travels a varied and sizable portion of the world, with each chapter describing a new location and new foods to eat. It is worth noting that this book was written during, and is the perfect complement to the show "Cook's Tour" on Food Network.This book is quick, fluid, and enjoyable. He delves into details that are fascinating, such as the history of a certain city, the rise of Mexican chefs, his French summer home, the dangers of Cambodia, and so much more.All in all, it's a great little read that mixes a little bit of history, cooking, multi-culturalism, and Bordain's opinionated sayings. Nothing spectacular, but a good fun book.

Forester portrays India through a few main characters in an Indian city called Chandrapore. He describes an incident concerning an English school teacher, a local Muslim doctor, and two English woman. He tries, and the keyword here is &quot;tries&quot;, to show the racial and cultural tensions between the English rulers and the Indian locals.The way the people are presented in this book is a joke. The main character, Aziz, is laughable. He's unbelievably subservient. Also, the portrayal of Hindus is almost clownlike, and the English are presented as extreme snobs. Forester's India should not be taken as a true representation of India at all.The first half is barely readable. The language is not too fluid, and the action is slow. One of my main gripes is that Forester interludes a lot dialog without referring to who is speaking. It's quite disconcerting. The second half is much better. It concentrates on a trial, and the aftermath on friendship. I was able to read this half in one sitting.The story itself is enjoyable. The aspects of justice, prejudice and friendship penetrates this novels story in every way. If this book was about some anonymous countrymen in an anonymous country, this would be well worth the price.I recommend this book, but as a story, and not as a cultural portrayal.

If you were to dissect this book line by line and write essays upon essays about its themes and symbolism, this could be a very good book. If you are the type of person that enjoys pondering every aspect, every page, and every word - this could be right up your alley. If, however, you enjoy reading for the sake of reading, skip this book.It's almost as if Joyce took pains to confuse and annoy the reader. Though filled with good chunks of reading, the sentence structure is very awkward, and the progression of the book is disjoint and puzzling at times. Joyce will capture you with some aspect of the main character's childhood, and then switch to an extremely boring dialogue about philosophy.I truly understand what Joyce was trying to convey, and is the reason why it's two stars. The themes of religion, politics, sex, and money all come in to play, and affect the main character as he moves from childhood, to adolescence, then to his teen years. If this message was delivered in an easier package, I might have really enjoyed this book.Basically, if I were to write in the same style as Joyce, I would be fired from my job right on the spot.

This book is like American Beauty of the 1930s. A man, trapped into a rigid social order, bursts out uncontrollably. Amazingly, this novel focuses on modern themes that still exist today, despite being written seventy years ago.One man, going to dances and social clubs, trying to keep his community standing in tact, maintaining his marriage, just couldn't take it anymore. A simple thing like disliking a man's story later tears his life apart. Such a simple constrained life blew up like a high-pressure balloon.While not a story with action or a plot, it is a literary device that portrays the upper-middle class life at that time. It's a nice timepiece and gives the reader a sense of living that life. A typical small Depression era American town with a country club and speak easy.It's a suprisingly quick and easy read, with a good description of life, and an opening for social interests. Unfortunately, it doesn't captivate readers like many other literary masterpieces.

Okay, in terms of literature, I'm not very appreciative of the great works of English literature. I was one of those guys that hated English class, and believed Cliff Notes were a great substitute for the real deal. That's why it's out of character for me to recommend this book.If anyone has read my other reviews, I love plot, action, fluidity, and dialogue. This book is the exact opposite, but yet I loved it. It takes about 50 pages to get used to Hemingway's style (this is the first I've ever read any of his books), but once accustomed to it, the amount of detail is fantastic.This book makes reader feel like they're in Pamplona, in the bullfights, at the parties, and drinking the wines. It's amazing. Hemingway paints a picture of Spain that can not be matched. The Spanish tourism board should hand this book out instead of a standard brochure.Though the language style is a bit terse, and the plot is almost non-existent, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Don Quixote is a classic piece of literature. If someone could produce a more up to date, vernacular translation, it would rival any comedy made today. This is a story about one man caught up in so many chivalry books that he becomes insane and starts traveling through Spain acting as a heroic knight while fighting made up villains and monsters. By his side is his gullible yet loyal servant Sancho.It's nice to know that during the Renaissance period such humor existed. The first part of the book deals with him traveling throughout and mixing up inns for castles, random people as kings or knights, and a random woman as his unrequited love for which all of the world must know. It's a tragic comedy where one man's insanity and futility provide worry for a few, concern for others, and great entertainment for most of the characters.What's interesting is the "twist" in the middle that leads to the second part, where after one man wrote a book about Don Quixote's wild adventures, a rich family, upon seeing the actual man who was in the book, decide to play along in probably the cruelest hoax in history. Claiming there Duke and Duchess, and promising the most absurd things. One of which was giving Sancho an actual province to rule over.The one thing that irked me about this book was that even though it needs to be translated for English readers, no translator has yet made the book as fluid or readable as it deserves to be.All in all, it's a good book, but hopefully a general author, and not some stuffy scholar, could translate it what it should be - a really funny and tragic story.

This book is story of two books - one of great fluidity, great sequences, -the other one of no plot, little action, and very little intrigue. Mario Puzo is always a great read, and when reading his works, pages just seem to fly by. The unfortunate thing is that this book is 500 pages (more like 800 because of the small font) of nothing.There really is no plot. It basically chronicles a man named John Merlyn for a few years, as he visits or works in Las Vegas, then New York, and then Los Angeles. Another Puzo novel, the Fortunate Pilgrim, also really doesn?t have a plot, but the characters and description are so interesting, it captivates the reader. This book has none of that. The characters are not appealing, a little unreal, and are not really covered in great depth.Also, the book gets repetitive after a while. Puzo feels the need to describe the same emotions of the some character over and over again in only slightly different situations.Of the few books I've read of Puzo, this is by far the worst.

The quest for the orb's climatic finish finally occurs in this book. Garion and everyone else in the group finally battle for the orb. In a dramatic battle, the orb is taken, and all seems well. This is the first half of the book, and it was a dousy.The second half of the book, however, is dull and tedious. No real adventure occurs. It's merely a read about the management and ruling of the world, and about the princess's feelings. Nothing more than that. The series takes a dramatic turn downhill after the orb is taken, and it is by far the worst part of the series. It's tedious and dull at this point.Edding has the usual stuff going for him - his language - the characters - the development of the prophecy - and the characters. The arguments between the slave women and the Ulgo are hilarious and witty. Though probably the worst book in the series, it is still not too bad.

Out of the two albums released simultaneously, this is by far the superior one. That's not saying much because there are both pretty bad. Out of two albums, he's made about three good songs. That's it. This album, Sweat, is harder of the albums. Suit is the softer, R&B; influenced debacle.Now, unlike all the Nelly haters out there, I really enjoyed Nelly's previous albums. Country Grammer was an excellent album with Nelly's patented unique voice, creative fast paced beats, and great contributions by the rest of the St. Lunatics. He fused hardcore music and beats to make catchy yet aggressive hip-hop. I really thought it was a fluke album by a fluke artist until Nellyville came out. That could possibly be the arguably be my favorite rap album of all time. "Air Force Ones" has got one of the greatest singles of all times.Well, Sweat is just a bad album. The worst part of this album is that most of the songs sound just like every other song. True story - some songs are so similar, I thought my car's CD player's forward song button broke because songs 7, 8, 9 sound so much alike. This is by far a generic album that really shows a lack of effort or skill.Here are the songs:1) Heart of a Champion (2 out of 5) - Generic filler material with the exception that the chorus is based on the NBA on NBC's theme music - the one composed by John Tesh.2) Na-Nana-Na (3 out of 5) - The most original song of the album. Nelly really doesn't do much with the lyrics though. The chorus is unique and complements the pseudo-trance beat.3) Flap Your Wings (5 out of 5) - By far his best. This is why it was the first single. Typical great Nelly single that has consistently propelled him to the top. Too bad this is the only song of this caliber on both albums.4) American Dream - (1 out of 5) - Sort of laid back, but lyrically and rhythmly dull. Sort of a bad clone of Nellyville's "Oh Nelly", "Dem Boyz", or Country Grammer's "Wrap Sumden", except much slower and weaker.5) River Don't Runn - (1 out of 5) - Sound like the previous song, except with a touch of reggae, but just as dull.6) Tilt Ya Head Back (0 out of 5) - Christina Aguilera? Now this one ticks me off. How can you rap about not getting respect from the hip hop establishment in your previous album, and then sing a duo with Miss Genie in a Bottle? This reeks of a bad cross-marketing gimmick.7) Grand Hang Out (3 out of 5) - Finally, a faster beat. Still pretty slow with an annoying chorus. Definitely reminiscent of Country Grammer's radio singles, though not as well.8) Getcha Getcha (1 out of 5) - Pretty much the same beat as the previous song, just slower. Sounds like number 4. Nothing original. Chorus is pretty ordinary. Plain filler.9) Another One (1 out of 5) - Sounds just like 4, 5, 8. Couldn't bother to listen to this song longer than a few seconds.10) Spida Man (1 out of 5) - Just terrible. Slow rap, slower beat, lyrics are boring. Literally a song that can put you to sleep.11) Playa (1 out of 5) - A slow funk bass line with a terrible woman's voice (Missy Eliot?) singing chorus. Pretty boring, lame, and forced.12) Down in Da Water (1 out of 5) - Sounds just like 4, 5, 8, 9. Seriously. No kidding. Have you ever met anyone who hated rap? They say it all sounds the same. After listening to this song, I can finally see there point of view.13) Boy - (2 out of 5) Guess what? It sounds like tracks 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 with the exception of some techno beat dubbed on top of it.This is the ultimate generic album. Nelly has definitely lost his edge and creativity.

A young man, struggling through college with a job and classes and the upcoming bar, finds out his future job is gone. He's in debt because his girlfriend dumped him right after buying her expensive jewelry, while facing the one of the worst Lawyer job markets around, and he just got evicted. This no luck kid finds the case of a lifetime.Grisham expertly weaves a story about this young lawyer during a crucial time of his life. Through chance, he joins up with a sleazy law firm, finds and rescues a helpless girl, and takes on a large corporation. It's a touching story that really makes you root for the main character. The book is easy and fun read, and like any Grisham novel, the pages fly by.The book is not perfect however. The ending is predictable and corny, and the hard luck story gets old after a while.I suggest this book to anyone that wants a good read. I would not recommend the movie though, as it doesn't capture any of the essence.

I was really disappointed when I listened to Sweat by Nelly. Wow, that was pretty bad. I never thought an artist could digress from one album to the next that badly. I stand corrected because I just listened to Nelly's Suit. Talk about terrible!Now, unlike all the Nelly haters out there, I really enjoyed Nelly's previous albums. Country Grammer was an excellent album with Nelly's patented unique voice, creative fast paced beats, and great contributions by the rest of the St. Lunatics. He fused hardcore music and beats to make catchy yet aggressive hip-hop. I really thought it was a fluke album by a fluke artist until Nellyville came out. That could possibly be the arguably be my favorite rap album of all time. "Air Force Ones" has got one of the greatest singles of all times.So, I actually expected something listenable from his double release. Big letdown. While Sweat is composed of music somewhat like what you would expect from Nelly, Suit, however, is pure R&B; based hip-hop. Now asking Nelly to do R&B; is like reading poetry by Jewel or discussing Wittengstein with George W. Bush - it plain doesn't work. Out of the 11 tracks, all sound very similar, and only about 3 are listenable.1) Play it off (1 out of 5) - The most generic, formulaic song of the album. Soft, boring lacks any originality. Chorus sounds like any other chorus Pharrel sings in.2) Pretty Toes (1 out of 5) - Somewhat fast paced, decent for about 30 seconds, until the boring, annoying chorus comes in.3) My Place (2 out of 5) - Not too shabby, but that's because it sounds just like Country Grammer's Luvin Me.4) Paradise (2 out of 5) - Practically the same beat as the previous songs, with a little more bass. Chorus is not god awful, so it's not that terrible.5) She Don't Know my Name (1 out of 5) - Similar soft bass line and drumbeat as the others. It has Snoop Dogg, which means it could only be good if Nelly had a time machine and could travel back to a time when Snoop Dogg made good music and didn't make up words.6) N Dey Say (1 out of 5) - A love song beat, with a little bass that is just terrible.7) Woodgrain and Leather with a Hole (2 out of 5) - He wastes a minute talking, and that could be the best part of this song. Yet again, same boring soft beat. Chorus isn't too bad, so it's listenable.8) In My Life - (3 out of 5) - The rap and beats sound like every other song. Mase surprisingly saves this song, and chorus is kind of upbeat and catchy.9) Over and Over (3 out of 5)- Tim McGraw? WTF? I thought it was misprint. I hate country music, yet Nelly is bad in this song that Tim McGraw sounds pretty good. The music is not too shabby, and the chorus is sort of relaxing.10) Nobody Knows - (4 out of 5) - What is this, a song that actually exudes effort? A song that I actually like listening to? By far the best song of the album and the only one I could recommend it to anyone. Extremely soulful - Anthony Hamilton really adds to the song.11) Die For You (1 out of 5) - Sounds exactly like most of the other bad songs on the album. Generic, unoriginal - a song you'll immediately skip after one listen.Basically, with the exception of Nobody Knows, this is basically filler material. It's a shame that we lost a good musician due to artistic indifference.

Usually, being kept in the dark by a book is a bad thing. This usually results in a muddled, incomprehensible mess. Not in this case. He successfully pulls off the greatest act of intrigue ever, by intentionally leaving the reader as clueless as the main character.The main character is brought to Washington under false pretenses to discover that his weekend party with three other couple may be a meeting of some Omega agents. The only problem is, no one knows who is and who isn't part of Omega. Now the main character has got to lead a double life, protect his family against Omega, figure out who are his true friends, and worry about the CIA protection.While the middle of the book feels kind of jumbled, and beginning of the book is slightly dull, the book is immensely readable and fun. Definitely not an action packed book (not until the end at least), Ludlum instead brings the low-key mundane trivialities of life into a new light. Does a particular sentence reveal something about his or her loyalties, does weary a gaudy piece of jewelry mean your connected with an organization? Finding out the truth behind everything becomes harder and more alluring than ever.All in all, I would recommend this quick page turner.

For the longest time, I made fun and dismissed Harry Potter as a kid's fad that could not even come close to providing one second of entertainment. Someone lent me the Harry Potter DVD, and I must admit I was impressed, so I decided to pick up this book. After reading it, I must say it's not that bad after all.I can see why Harry Potter series is as popular as it is. It's an imaginative tale of magic and fun, throw in a magic school, interesting teachers, monsters, ghosts, and good old school yard camaraderie and rivalries, and anyone can see the appeal. I wish these books were released ten years earlier so I would have enjoyed it more.Harry Potter continues another school year with the same gang of characters, except right before school, he receives a hilarious but ominous warning about dyeing this year. What turns out is that a monster is loose at Hogwarts, causing havoc and fear for all. Harry and his friends must solve the mystery of the monster, who let the monster out, and how to stop it.I wish there were more dialogue and more action, as description after description could get tedious sometimes, especially for the young. However, it is still a good book, and I might continue reading the rest of the series.

John Grisham produces another great book here. It starts out with a bombing gone awry. One man meant to only bomb a building, but instead kills two innocent children and destroys another life. Thirty years later, one of the bombers in sitting on death row, a former Klan activist, waiting to die when his unknown grandson appears as a lawyer in hopes to rescue him.Grisham does another excellent job describing a story, with great mastery and fluidity, of one man's last ditch effort to save his grandfather from death. Even though his emphasis on law is profound, he delves into deeper issues such as family, the question of the death penalty, and other emotional issues that one does see in other Grisham novels (with the exception of A Painted House).What's really fascinating is that nothing in this book is not black and white. For each issue he brings up, there are good and bad points - each issue is a gray area. He describes the horrors of death row, but then juxtaposes it with the deaths of the two youngsters. Instead of making the main character purely good or evil, he mixes it a bit. Sometimes you wish the inmate would fry, sometimes you feel he's innocent.Another good point about the book is that it's not a farfetched story, like the Street Lawyer or the Firm, it's a book that could be confused with a documentary. He doesn't revolve action or plot twists, but instead relies on the psychological aspects of all sides of a death sentence.The only bad point, of which Grisham tends to do a lot, is he is repetitive. Many, many parts were repeated over and over again. This 700-page book could have been reduced to 500-page book without any loss of detail. Pages 200 to 400 just dragged on and on and on. The last 150 pages, though nothing exciting happens, is really intense and emotional, and is what makes this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone. It's a slight departure for Grisham, as he delves into more psychological elements, but it works well.

This book is a good read; it's fun, entertaining, and factual correct. Landsburg explains simple concepts through the eyes of an economist with blinders on. It's an interesting read where pages seem to fly by. For an educational book, it flows as freely as a novel, and is incredibly gripping for something about economics. He presents different scenarios, from the price of popcorn to government debt, and shows how a true economist would view each situation in small bite sized chapters. It's both refreshing, and at some points, eye-opening.One problem is that he tends to simplify everything way too much. It's hard to relate what he says to the real world when many of the details are gone. For example, when explaining national debt, he talks about the lending rate, and the rate of return to being exactly the same. He doesn't explain what would happen if they were different.Another problem I had is the lack of continuity. He seems to switch from one topic to another without any direction. Sometimes, the types of arguments were repeated from one hundred pages ago, while the previous page had nothing to do with the current page. With about 30 or so seemingly random arguments and situations present, it's hard to place it all into any lesson or theme.Finally, and most importantly, Landsburg seems to take out his aggressions and displays some mean spirited rants in the latter part of the book. I felt that it incredibly hurt his credibility. When someone starts debasing someone else's opinion vehemently and atrociously, it gives the impressions of fanaticism rather than cool-headed thinking. He seems to enjoy criticizing every line of particular papers and making the writer feel like an idiot. He even goes so far as to reprinting a letter he wrote to his daughter's kindergarten teacher espousing the horrors of environmentalism and how the teacher is indoctrinating his daughter into it.I would recommend this book as good, fun, quick read. As an educational piece, it needs to be more organized and more levelheaded.

This overtly philosophical novel is about Howard Roarke. This book describes the career of a fiercely independent architect, who exemplifies Ayn Rand's objectivism. His career is juxtaposed with a colleague from college, Peter Keating, and is intertwined with other characters, including a unique woman named Dominique, a successful businessman name Wynand, and a famous "intellectual", Tooley.Rand thoroughly describes each individual's concept of humanity throughout the book. This is strength, and a flaw. The dialogues are very, very contrived, and at points insulting to the reader's intelligence. Keating and Roarke's rivalry was thoroughly enjoyable. To see such those two in tandem, though extremely overt, was stimulating. The inclusion of other characters, especially Dominique, bored me to death. Even though she provides a sort of bridge between two the two rival philosophies, her intrusion into the story is convoluted and serves little purpose than to occupy pages.This book contains a great message. It's almost hard to find anyone who doesn't relate to Howard Roarke's character. It's lack of subtlety, its super preachy and continuous dialogues, annoying other characters, all deter it from making it an enjoyable read. I found myself glued to some pages, while trudging through others. It's best to describe this as an essay containing fictional characters, rather than a classic novel.Some people say that this book changed their life. Fair enough, but all the philosophy and messages are presented throughout simple economic principles, historical affairs, and common sense. The only true insight I gained from this was the definition of objectivism. Not worth 700 pages of only mildly interesting reading.Would I recommend this book? Probably, it's not that bad, and you can decide for yourself.

I could not put this book down. Without a doubt, this is one the greatest books I have ever read. It combines science fiction, fantasy, action, suspense, and a little bit of psychology into a great package. Crichton does an unbelievable job with this book.Basically, a weird type of ship is found on the bottom of the floor. Is it an alien ship? Is it human? Who knows? What secrets does it possess? Oh, it has quite a bit of excitement though. I could not give away anything else without giving away the plot, and I wouldn't dare.I started this book on a Sunday afternoon, and finished it on a Sunday night. I skipped laundry, I skipped dinner - heck, I even skipped the Simpsons. The only flaw I could find in this book was that it was too good, and I couldn't put it away.I've never seen the movie, nor would I want to, because no movie could do this book justice. I highly recommend skipping the movie and go straight to the book. In fact, I'm going to stop the review so you can order the book now.

This was the second Crichton book I've ever read. I shouldn't even say read, I should say experienced. What an unbelievable action book! I cannot praise this book highly enough. The only complaint that I have against this book is that I ruined my Monday, as I stayed up late on Sunday to finish it.What starts off as an underwater search turns into a harrowing tale of mystery, then action, then suspense, and then psychology. Without giving much away, the story revolves around a team researching a strange artifact, and things start going wrong. But why are things going wrong? Who's responsible? What's the motivation? Throughout the book, as the action unfolds, the mysteries and the actions get weirder and more intriguing. It's a true page-turner.In fact, it's so good, I refuse to see the movie. No director on Earth could present this book on film as well as it presents itself on paper. Another adaptation of this book, no matter how good, would only damper my experience.It's so good, I became an instant Crichton fan, and bought as many books of his as I could. I highly recommend this book.

What defines a good book? How about fluid writing style, a gripping plot, great social commentary, great action, superb dialogue, interesting and dynamic characters, a well presented environment? Well, most books, even my favorites, don't encompass all these qualities. I've finally found a book that does.Knowing nothing about this book, I wanted to start this small classic and finish up in a few days. Less than two hours later I wrapped this book up with my mouth wide open. I could not believe how good a book could be.Basically this book captures the flaws of communism and capitalism in a fantastic fairy tale about one farm rebellion and it's aftermath. It works as a great story, it works as a mirror to modern society, and it works as representation of the Soviet Union. Pardon the clich&eacute;, but it works on all levels.Basically, read this book.

Before I was to set to embark upon a long secluded road trip, I decided to check out the public library's audio book section. I saw Queen of the Damned and thought that if they made a movie about it, it must be somewhat enjoyable. I should have known why no one watched the movie.Maybe because the audio book was abridged, but this book made no sense whatsoever. First, some guy is walking about, then some woman talks about her family, then some funky dreams occur, some queen kills a lot of religious males for some apparent reason, then ancient Egyptian cannibals are brought in to the mix, then the same queen dies. Apparently, Queen Akasha destroyed a village of people eaters, except two twins during ancient Egyptian times. The Queen comes back, gets mad a lot, and faces the same twins in the final battle. That's pretty much it.I saw the Interview with a Vampire, I thought that this might capture some of the essence. Not even close. Avoid this like the plague.

I bought this game one year ago. I usually finish games within a few weeks, so this game just sat in my gamecube wasting away. This game is long, sometimes frustrating, but very, very rewarding. Completing the game takes about 60 hours, and that is with some help from a gamefaq's walkthrough.The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere and graphics. Even for a last generation game, it is impressive. This and Resident Evil 4 really showed that the Gamecube was quit the superb little graphical powerhouse. The lighting, the water, all show new breakthroughs previously unseen in other games at that time. Each realm in the Zelda countryside all have an atmosphere that is both real and fitting.The game has an open feel encompassing all of the countryside. You get snow, castles, villages, canyons, underwater residences, lakes, etc. The variation and the look is amazing. The amount of things to explore, like all Zelda games, is massive. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.This brings the most important thing - gameplay. Each dungeon is unique in its presentation and gameplay. Many of them are quite ingenious. For example, to pass a certain level, you need to hit a switch with an arrow, which would then turn on an electric current that turns a metallic cave's roof into a giant magnet, which you can climb when you put on magnetic boots. These are the types of "puzzles" that need to be solved. This game rewards thought, not just reflexes.There are some problems though. I hate bosses in all games, because if you die in the middle, you have to restart it. Also, bosses tend to have one gimmick which you must find out about, and you will just die and die until you figure out the gimmick. Zelda's bosses fit this description. Fortunately, they are not difficult. Also, many levels require you to look at a certain place, or hook into some place that you would have never thought of. For example, in the last level, you have to shoot a painting, which looks like it's just part of the background. If there weren't any walkthroughs on the Internet, I would still be stuck there.Finally, this is game is long. Way too long. For some people, that is a good thing. For me, not so much. I stopped caring about the story after a while. Not because it's wasn't compelling, but just I wanted to get this game over with.All in all, a great adventure game that lives up to the Zelda name.Pros:Great graphics for a last gen gameBeautiful atmosphereNice looking cutscenesVery balancedUnique, inventive, and well thought out dungeonsCons:Needs a walkthrough at a few pointsCould have been shorterTime for Zelda to have voice actingDifficulty: MediumTime to Complete: 60 hoursFrustration level: Medium

I cannot express how bad this book is. In all fairness, I only got through half the book, but that's because if I continued, I would have wasted my time and tried my patience. This book is incomprehensible, convoluted, and just plain horrible.The major problem is that this books gets worse and worse by each chapter. This is because a chapter requires that you know what happened in the previous chapter. Since this book starts off pretty bad, it gradually turns into a foreign language by chapter 7.Another problem is that the author also has no fluidity. Compound this with the fact that this book is technical book, it makes reading one page a major chore.Finally, the examples are just plain bad. First, it requires the reader to be very familiar with Visual C++. That's not all bad, but the examples presented rely on information that was badly presented, hardly presented, or not presented yet. Also, the examples' explanations barely explain what the code does.If you're like me, a programmer that was curious about OpenGL, avoid this book. It's needless to say that my interest in OpenGL dwindled to nothing after trying to read this.

This book is really anti-Puzo. It doesn?t have much to do with the mob, crime, casinos, or gangsters, and it doesn?t have killings, executions, or any other street warfare. Heck, it doesn?t even have a plot. Instead, it?s about a family living in New York, and how the mother has learned to survive and raise a family alone.Sounds boring, right? Wrong. This could actually be Puzo?s finest work. From the family?s struggles through poverty and near poverty, to the fights of mother and daughter, to the disobedience of one son, and the suicide of another other, this book is a touching chronicle.Though not a novel you would expect from Puzo, it?s definitely his most poignant work, and shows that he can live past his Godfather typecast.

I'm the type of guy that can't stand many literary classics. I'm sorry, but I read a book for entertainment, not for metephors, meaning or symbolism. This is why it seems strange that I highly recommend this book.This book chronicles the life of immigrants from Lithuania who settle in Chicago in hopes of obtaining the American Dream. The way Sinclair describes the hardships of this family, it almost feels like you're the one who's suffering. Though depressing, the amount of detail engulfs the reader.Though the book is famous for exposing the meat packing industry's unsanitary conditions, it really is just a minor part of this book. The worker's rights, the racism, the corruption, and the poverty is what this book is all about. Though I'm a firm believer of Adam Smith and his invisible hand, half way through the book, I was searching for the local Socialist recruiter. Well, not really, but it will open anyone's mind.Except for the end, where it was just pure Socialist propoganda, this book is fantastic.

First off, I accidentally read two sentences in the front sleeve, and then I read the excerpt before page 1, and I immediately knew what the problem was, and how the problem would be solved. Unfortunately, Crichton decided to spend half the book building a mystery that is answered on the front sleeve of the book. The mystery falls flat, as the main character thinks his wife is cheating. Of course, that is not true, but it takes Crichton a heck of lot of time to get to the point. His "insights" into Silicon Valley are pretty much an extrapolation of stereotypes.About 140 pages into it, he finally starts the darn book as the main character gets to Nevada. It's a finally action packed, fluid, and fun, despite the fact that it feels like a blatant [take] of the movie Tremors. But hey, it was a good movie. Just replace worms with nano-particles, and you've got the same thing.Then, in the ending, it gets truly surreal with the typical hack ending. The last twenty pages are pretty much a yawner.His classic fluidity, and the 100 pages of action are what makes this book somewhat enjoyable.Without a doubt, one of his worst books. Timeline and now this. It seems like Crichton's career is just about winding down. Maybe he and Tom Clancy can move in with other Al Gore, MC Hammer, Michael Jordan, and other has beens.

Being brand new to John Irving, I decided to grab the smallest novel he wrote to see what his writing style was like. This novel provides the story of two couples and their wife swapping, intermingled with their past histories.I found the history and back story somewhat interesting, but not mundane minglings in the midst of war atrocities, art dealings, college wrestling tournaments, and in their suburban family life.However, the mundane nature of their lives, even though appropriate in terms of sticking with the plot, doesn't tend to a page turner. The terse language and lack of fluidity also makes this book a somewhat chore to read.While it an interesting look at love and personal relationships, the lack of anything compelling with below average fluidity means that I can't really recommend this book.

Hawking does a darn good effort of explaining the universe. The only problem is that quantum theory, space-time curvatures, virtual/real antiparticles/particles, wave/particle duality, the anthropic principles, , , 1, 2 spin particles, relativity, quantum chromodynamics and other such topics cannot all be explained in a few pages each. Even it were, these new teachings could not easily be used to further construct more elaborate theory without more in-depth knowledge anyway.This book is not an easy read, but it is a page-turner. Sometimes you'll find yourself re-reading a paragraph, and sometimes you'll be forced to skip an explanation and take Hawking's assumption at face value.His explanation of the macro universe is easily followable, but when delves into quantum theory, the book loose much of it's momentum. He tends to assume quite a bit about the reader's knowledge. For example, he constantly refers to virtual particles, yet he never explains what exactly those are. For most readers, college physics was years ago, or might not have even been taken.I was able to pick up most of the paragraphs, but unfortunately I wasn't able to piece them together cohesively. At some points he digresses into black holes, then wormholes, then quantum theory, or other topics that don't quite fit at the moment. Understandably, each topic is required, but Hawking does a relatively poor job wrapping everything up in a nice little package for each chapter.Though sometimes frustrating, it is an eye opener and an interesting topic. I wished it went deeper into history, and provided a primer for the most basic theories he uses. I would recommend this to anyone who just studied advanced physics as a way to broaden and appreciate what they just learned.

This game is one giant deathmatch. I'm not saying that it's good or bad, it's just one giant deathmatch. If you love large scale first person shooters where you can play against a lot of other people, this is your game and you should buy it right away. If you want a game with levels, saves, CGI movies, coop levels, this doesn't really have any of that.The game consists of two groups - Empire versus Rebels for half the game, Republic versus the Separatists in the other half with about 200 to 250 people per side. The battlefield is a medium sized field on different planets with different terrains (forest, beach, desert, ice), the vehicles, of which you control, range from simple speeder to huge Imperial walkers. You control one soldier in a battle until you die, then you respawn and continue the battle. You win the battle by killing all the enemies or capturing their respawn points. The only other control you have is that you can order a few nearby soldier to follow you or stay put. Pretty simple and straightforward.The single level mode is basically a series of battles, either following the timeline of original Star Wars trilogy or the prequels, or through a galactic conquest sequence that you invade planets and expand an empire. Either way, it's just a flimsy excuse to get to the battle. There is also a split screen mode, but it really is just the same battle.The main part is the multi player online portion, where you participate with a large number of others. The online portions still suffer from some of the normal online difficulties of this current game system generation. I think you can even set up your computer a server itself (I have not tried it though) for the online portion if you don't want to bother with main server.

This book describes the life of the town of Odessa, Texas and its obsession with its high school football team. There is no wonder why this is considered one of the greatest sports books of all time. It follows a season, cycling through the fanatical fans and the players whose lives are devoted to winning a football game.This book is a fluid look at practically a foreign country. It both vilifies and praises this simple life of a football dominated town. It talks of both the players struggles, along with the town itself. It ranges from a Harvard bound linebacker to the racial gerrymandering used to gain running backs.History, football, personal tragedy, personal triumph, racial bigotry, class separation, dreams lost, dreams reached - all encompass this powerful and entertaining book. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

I was always hesitant to get this album because I thought this would just a collection of B-sides or rejected material. This is not the case. This could very well be their best album so far.The best way I can complement this album is to say this: it does not need a skip forward button to be listened. Even the best bands in the world love to throw in filler or bad experiments now and then. System does not! Every song is just really good.This album has an unfiltered and unaltered quality that I find amazing. While in their other studio release albums, they use Serj's voice to it's full effect and work the instruments to rightly emphasize his voice, this album strays away from that. Boom! and I-E-A-I-A-I-O have a raw sound that is good abrupt and powerful. System also gets laid back (well, as much as System can) with tracks that are melodic and simple (in a good way) with Highway Song, Ego Brain, and especially Streamline.This is just a great album, plain and simple. It has a weird, poetic, political effect with a great combination of harsh and melodic vocals. Sixteen great songs for a lower than normal price makes me feel that I am actually stealing this album. In my eyes, this album pushed System of a Down from a band that I enjoyed to perhaps the greatest band in existence today.

This game has an interesting concept. You're an alien, and you have to take over the country. You're named Crypto, and you accomplish this task through over twenty levels, spanning six areas. Each mission, with the exception of the last, is very short (i.e. less than 20 minutes). They are mostly in the form of a third person shooter, but sometimes require you take control of a flying saucer.The gameplay mechanics are pretty simple. For the third person aspect, you have 4 total weapons, and a few telepathic powers (brainscan, lift objects, copy the form of a human). Most missions require you to get to some certain place. Often times you need to copy the form of a person and walk to the place. It's a little annoying, because you can't use weapons or pick up objects in a human form, and certain federal agents keep disrupting your human form (which, in latter missions, means you start the mission over). Afterwards, you just have to shoot people, protect, or destroy objects. Nothing radical or special here. The controls are really easy to master though.For the saucer parts, you control a saucer that apparently can't go up or down. You use a few weapons to destroy certain things, and you can collect items to give you more ammo or heal your ship. Pretty simple, though standard fair.This game, though, is very playable. The graphics are pretty good. The levels, though really small, offer some freedom of movement (everyone says GTA, but it's definitely not as large or as open). Except for the last level, you don't repeat or get stuck in one place for too long. It's a bit on the easy side in the beginning, and a bit annoying at the end, but the difficulty balance is pretty good. Also, the cutscenes and humor are both funny and relevant to today's politics. That's an added bonus.However, there are numerious problems with this game. Many people somehow love this game, but unfortunately, I don't see it. First off, there are no mission saves or checkpoints. This is beyond lame. I don't like repeating stuff I already did. Even though missions are short, I still don't want to repeat 15 minutes of gameplay if I die in the end. At the end of the game, getting to the boss requires 20 minutes of gameplay. After dying a few times, I said forget this and used a cheat to finish the last 5 minutes. Secondly, this game doesn't offer much in terms of gameplay. Not much strategy or innovation involved. The shoot 'em up is really standard, and the stealth movement is annoying because it's just boring (take the shape of a human, scan a person, avoid federal agent, rinse, repeat). Finally, there is no fluidity or continuity. There are constant breaks in the action, as missions are small and repetitive, so that it is a major chore to sit and play this game for more than an hour straight.All in all, it's not a bad game, but it really isn't that good of a game either.Pros:Good graphicsGood cut-scenesFunnyCons:No misison saves, checkpointsShort missionsNo fluidity, continuityNo online, multiplayer, lasting qualitiesRepetitiveUnoriginal gameplay mechanics.Difficulty: Easy/MediumFrustration Level: Low/MediumHours to Complete: 10 hours

Though a children's book by name, it by no means is confined to youngsters. I like to consider the Harry Potter Diet Lord of the Rings. While enchanting for the kids, it's actually a fun, interesting read. In fact, it was a perfect way to waste away a great Sunday.

This book has accomplished something that few 200 some odd page do - make it feel like a 500 page book. The main problem I have is that for most of the book is that hardly anything happens. This book neither captivates you with a plot, develops any characters, or immerses you in a setting.Basically, a man gets hypnotized and starts reading peoples minds and predicting the future. He sees a ghost, reads a neighbor's mind, has an encounter with a baby sitter, and fights with his wife. That's the first ninety percent of the book. Matheson probably realized that nothing happened, so he threw in some hackneyed plot twist to add some excitement. Needless to say, it doesn't work.Another problem I had with this book is the flow and language structure. He likes throwing brief tidbits of conversation, which annoyed me to death. Many times I had to re-read paragraphs due to the fact that he omitted context and who said it.Ignore all those people who say that this delves into great psychological terror. Nope, it deals with a boring man with a boring gift living a boring place. Silence of the Lambs this ain't. What makes a good book? Not being able to put it down. What makes a bad book? Not being able to pick it up. This book is boring and tedious - the only reason why I finished it is because I actually spent my hard earned money on it.

When the first Getaway came out, it was naturally compared to the revolutionary Grand Theft Auto 3. It was the first game similar in the city re-creation aspect to follow GTA3. After years of creation, it was released with much fanfare and a lower price of $39.95. While it wasn't a failure, it sure did not live up to the hype.Now the sequel has been released in a much more subdued launch, with much lowered expectations, and though it is extremely flawed, it's an enjoyable game. It's a strange game. In terms of gameplay, in terms of problems, and in terms of wasted potential, this game should be terrible. Despite all that though, for weird reason, I couldn't put it down.Even though it has the City of London to traverse through, the game is mostly a third person shooting game with just a smaller part consisting of driving or chasing missions. You play as three different character in 22 chapters, a cop and a criminal, and a teenager.First, the bad. The most glaring problem are the camera angles. In many missions, the camera is the toughest enemy. Close quarter angles are just terrible. This is mostly an indoor shooting game, and much of it relies on stealth and looking over corners . The camera just doesn't want to cooperate. It's just bad. I can't stress that enough.This brings up the stealth missions. Now, with the camera described above, it makes it annoying. While doable, you'll be spotted, but you'll never see who spotted you. While a nice change of pace from the constant gun firing, the camera ruins it as you can't see half the stuff you need to. It's also sometimes pretty unintuitive to figure out where you need to go.The game is short, which is what I prefer, but the reply value is virtually non-existent. You get to roam around London, go back to missions to find keys to I guess unlock more stuff, race, or drive a cab. I had no inclination to do any of those except drive around London, and that was dull after twenty minutes.Finally, what good is reproducing London if it's really just a gateway to the missions? In the original GTA 3, the city was always an integral part of most missions. In this game, it's just a place to drive through. There is a lot that can happen, but Team Soho didn't bother to take full advantage of their years of work. I can only imagine a shootout in Hyde Park, or snipers on the Tower Bridge.Now to the good. As with the first game, the graphics are great. London is as, well, Londony as ever, the graphics for the indoor parts of the missions are smooth, polished, and capture the ambiance of warehouses, office buildings, slums, etc. Unlike the first game though, the map is really useful, as it tells you where you are and where you're headed, so there is no need to rely on those horrible blinkers from the first game. Even if don't use the map, the blinkers actually perform much, much better than the first game. Team Soho saw the weakest part of their previous game and tackled it.Though I think most cut scenes are usually game filler with no redeeming value, the cut-scenes compliment this game very well. They're much shorter than the first game, and describe a particular event from three different perspectives. They intermingle well with the game and add to the gameplay, not detract from it.Finally, it's just addictive. I got it Wednesday, thinking I would have something to play over the weekend. I finished the second half of the game in one sitting on Friday night. A game has great flow and is addictive when someone like me, who can't sit still for an hour straight, can play this for almost five hours straight without even realizing it.Don't expect miracles, in fact, expect some flawed gameplay. But still, it was a fun game.Pros:Could not put it downStory and gameplay splicing is perfectImproved map and handling was a drastic improvementGreat flow with little frustrationGreat graphicsNo backtracking and little repetitionCons:Camera is perhaps the worst I've seen on PS2Stealth missions don't workUp close aiming not as fine tunedDoesn't really use the city of LondonExtras are uselessTime to Complete: 10 hoursFrustration Level: LowDifficulty Level: Low

First off, I must say that Splinter Cell is the leader of stealth action games. It's fun, thoughtful, and intuitive. This game took many of the flaws of it's predecessors - "Pandora Tomorrow" and improved upon it. The three main improvements are the ability to save at any time, co-op, and a slightly better close up killing method.All in all, if you played the other Splinter Cell's, it's pretty much the same. Which is good. You still can shoot lights, you still need to stick to the shadows, walk softly, kill quietly, and hack your way in. It continues the most thought provoking action series around, even though the latter levels are pretty annoying. The game mechanics have yet to be matched by any other game around.The level designs are fun, unique, and varied. There 10 levels, with levels 3 to 8 being equally the best.Unfortunately, this is not a perfect game. While there have been improvements from the previous game, there have been some drawbacks. In my opinion, some strategy and thinking have been removed from this game. Pandora Tomorrow (at least the first half), was really a thinking man's game. This chapter in the series sort of eliminates it. It's more of, "how many guys are there I need to kill". I found less reliance on shooting lights, taking out cameras, sneaking around and avoiding enemies, and more concentration on just plain shooting. Kind of dull and annoying (especially the last two horrid levels). Also, hand to hand combat is still not good enough. The newly added knife is excellent, but it still attracts attention, and grabbing guards is still to finicky. With more enemies in smaller spaces in this game, this flaw really stands out.The co-op is interesting. Not as great as I'd hoped, but still not too shabby. It's definitely better than nothing, so I will give them credit for that. Since there are two people, it would have been interesting if there were more enemies, as both can handle the enemies simultaneously, but alas, the majority of the co-op is running really fast to avoid autoguns or figuring out where I can use the special co-op moves. The whole team aspect isn't really utilized in a manner befitting this series. It sort of feels tacked on. They have unique co-op missions that are really short, and the whole co-op only lasts a few hours, but there is no mid mission save for some reason. Oh well.There is online as well. I can't comment on it because I would just be fodder for Splinter Cell nerds living in their mom's basement, so I didn't try.Pros:Co-op existsStill the same great Splinter Cell gameplayKnife kills are quick and funCan save anytimeCons:Co-op shortToo much action, not enough stealthClose combat still not perfectTime to Complete (on normal): 15 hoursDifficulty (on normal): MediumFrustration Level (on normal): Medium

Lahiri writes some amazingly well written short stories documenting short periods of angst or troubles for a select few. In a matter of a few pages, she expertly and discretely develops a character.There are many great things about these stories. First off, though she talks about Indian and Indian American experiences, she successfully avoids the generic traps that have haunted Indian/Western literature and cinema. She doesn't delve into the tired clich&eacute; of how a western Indian can balance traditional and western norms, but instead concentrates on the personal and human conflicts that are universal to all. She pays particular attention to young married couples and relationships.The only problem I had with this book is that it's too well written for a depressing set of short stories. What I mean is that most of the stories are realistic, depressing and convincing at that. Many stories are so realistic that they somehow hit close to home. Near the end I was dreading reading the stories because I knew something would happen to the main characters (spoiler - near the end, there is at least happy ending).All in all, it's a great book for fans of literature.

Not being a fan of fantasy, I was little weary of this book. The only other fantasy books I read were The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I was surprised at how well this book came out. It's not just monsters and dragons, but a story about a world and a little farm boy named Garion.This book is humorous, action-filled, playful, and suspenseful. It's a great read, and Eddings has great fluidity. The book starts out on a farm, with one boy and his aunt. Throughout the book, tiny bits of information eventually lead this boy and a group to an epic adventure.The characters are great, each with its unique part to play. The plot is wonderfully done, as the story unfolds itself slowly, adding to the mystery surrounding the boy.Because of this, I vowed to read every other book in this five part series. I would recommend this book to anyone.

When one thinks of a mystery, one should think of this book. Sam Spade, the archetype tough guy with street smarts, tries to solve the mysterious death of his partner, finds out the truth behind the constant lies of a beautiful woman, deals with the police breathing down his neck, and deals with some vile criminals.This book grabs you with intrigue and one plot twist after another. New characters, new leads and new ideas are all constantly introduced. Is the innocent looking girl the most evil of them all, or was it the cheating wife? Could the main character himself be a murderer? What was the mysterious package? Questions that lead to riddles that lead to more questions. It's hard not to get caught up in this book.Though the book doesn't really delve deep into any character, and the fluidity of his writing may cause you to re-read a paragraph or two, this book is a short, solid, mystery that should definitely be read.

This is just a rushed game, plain and simple. This feels like a game that would have been a good starting point, but not a game in the later part of a console cycle with a great pedigree as Medal of Honor. The bargain price and lack of advertisement sort of confirms the amount of effort used to produce the game.The first thing that shocked me was no mid-mission saving or checkpoints. Huh? Did I suddenly get transported to the mid nineties? If so, remind me to buy some stock and housing. You die in the end of an hour long mission, you start the hour long mission from the very beginning! The only reason any game would not have constant saves is to mask the lack of playable levels by making the gamer repeat stuff over and over again. And, yes, that is the case here. What's really shameful is that the previous game in this series actually did have saves. I was near the end of the last level, about to complete the game when I died by a surprise rush of people. I am not going to waste another 50 minutes of my life to work on five minutes of gaming.The other things that this game lacked that the previous game (Rising Sun) had is online and co-op play. There is a multiplayer, but there are no robots. So, unless you have a multi-tap, it's one on one. That is not much of a multiplayer at all.There only 11 levels total. The first 6 are really just half the length of the latter 5. The look of the levels are usually dreary and monocolor at best (brown for the desert levels, white for the last 5 snow levels), and are just really dull. All in all, if you played all levels well and never had to repeat any part of a level, you'd have a grand total of about 7 hours of game play. Making this a rental if you really want to play this.Other problems also exist in the game play. The first is that for some reason, after killing a person, ammo will appear but disappear really soon. This leaves the player with a dilemma, run to the ammo and die in the open, or really have no ammo and be a sitting duck. The squad that you "control" is a laughable joke. The AI that controls it is terrible. You will be hiding, pinned down, and your three squad mates will run around like head-less chickens right in front of machine gun fire. Complete idiots. Also, there are other bad aspects, like the introducing a cliched boss. Don't get me started on the tedium of grenade throwing. Random times, the aiming just would not work. Up close shooting is terrible. Many times, enemies will sometimes shrug off direct hits. I could go on and on.There are some good points though. Levels 8, 9, 10, are actually pretty playable - well designed and somewhat fun. The sound is amazing. The game mechanics are spot on. Individually, the controls reward cautious, thoughtful game play. Given a few more months of development and fine tuning, a great game could have been produced. The game engine is there.Pros:Good general playing mechanicsGood soundGood engineCons:No save at any point of the missionNo co-opNo onlineHorrible squad matesNot many missionsDisappearing ammos/Lack of ammoMonochrome like levelsBad aimingBosses, why?Hours to complete - 12 hoursFrustration Level (on normal) - HighDifficulty (on normal) - Medium/High

The idea of a book about the other side of Beowulf intrigued me. John Gardner depicts Grendel and not the epitome of evil, but a complicated creature that is both humanistic and animal with both internal and external struggles. He takes a simple creature from a classic piece of literature and adds depth and substance.What I didn't enjoy was Gardner's writing style. He uses perhaps the most annoying literary device ever conceived. In order to reflect a character's unfocused views, he writes in an unfocused haphazard manor. The exact same thing that made Ford Maddux Ford's, "A Good Soldier", and any James Joyce novel practically unreadable.This book is a short story about Grendel's interaction with man, observing all along, sometimes wanting to be included, sometimes disgusted with them. He is intrigued by their wars, violence, relationships, there Gods, their music, and many of the people. He switches from a primal beast to a philosophical man in a figurative sense. He interacts with his mother, human singers, human hunters, and even a dragon to counteract the lesser human comparative aspect. This helps shape his deep, yet somewhat different points of view.Unfortunately, if told in a straightforward story, this would be interesting, fun, and thought provoking. Instead, Gardner mixes normal first person narrative with incongruous poetry all sprinkled with random philosophical ramblings all with an non-fluid sentence structure, causing any reader to re-read many confusing pages.I would pass on this book. The idea is interesting, but this book is no page turner, as the execution is terrible.

This book is supposedly a parody or &quot;fun&quot; horror novel. Since I didn't read any reviews previously, and the cover never mentioned it's &quot;fun&quot; nature, I was in for a horrible does of stupidity as I expected a serious horror book. It's basically a giant chase scene that gradually becomes so absurd and random that I can't see how anyone could enjoy it.The book starts off simply enough, with Chucky type rag doll attacking and chasing the main character, Tommy. Though somewhat off the wall, I've seen much worse. However, Tommy runs into a waitress during the chase, and they both start avoiding the doll. This is where it goes rapidly downhill. What starts with a simple hunt by the doll ends up some with weird stuff like alien dogs supplying supernatural powers, communicating to the dead through a radio, and old Vietnamese curses producing ghosts that can't enter a house, but can kill indiscriminately.Just plain dumb. I guess if that's what the point of the book was, well, it worked.

This book is amazing at some points. The struggle of the human body and mind to cope with the most difficult of situations. The adventure, the conflict, the suspense are almost unparalleled in modern fiction. The only flaw in this book is the fact that it's also somewhat unreadable at other points.First off, nothing of true significance happens in the first 100 pages. That's one third of the book totally wasted. A description of an advertising agency, a description of archery, and other such descriptions just disrupt the true meaning of the novel. Secondly, this book is not one of the most fluid books around. It's true that this book is fairly modern, but the pages don't turn like a Puzo or Clavell novel.However, once the reader trudges through the first one hundred pages and becomes accustomed to the Dickey's non fluid style, the books becomes a gem. Without giving away much of the plot, this rest of the book mostly chronicles two days of man's adventure when a simple canoeing trip goes terribly wrong.The sense of danger, action, suspense is all mixed in with moral dilemmas that make this one of the best adventures in literature. Dickey turns a simple situation into a complex web of lies, of death, and consequences. From the matter of climbing a rock face, to lying to cops, Dickey seems to thrust the reader into the problems of the main character.If Dickey trimmed the first 100 pages down to 10, this would be one of the greatest books I?ve ever read.

Like most people, after reading Ender's game, I rushed to get the next book of this series. Unfortunately this book does not do it's predecessor justice. I guess Orson Scott Card took a page out of the Dune series. He wrote a great initial book, and with that, trapped his readers into reading his philisophical writings.While the first book was outstanding with plenty of action, humanity and supsense, this second book concentrated on family, religion, and philosophy. There were times when this book dragged on and on with annoying side stories about a certain religous sect or a family squable.The book does start out well, and tries to present many questions after the discovery of a new intelligent species: the piggies. But before any of the questions could be answered, Card bulldozes the reader with family and religous stories and philosopies that the reader will probably never care about, thus separating the reader from the main story line for many pages.This book could have been condensed considerably, but Card probably wanted to stretch this series out to a few more books. Financially, who could have blamed him?Also note that this is not a typical sequel in that it's not a direct continuation. The action occurs three thousand years later, and with a few additions and alterations, it could have stood alone and not have been related to Ender's Game at all.This book does end nicely, and through the fluff there is an intelligent, well thought out plot. However, don't expect to flip through this book as quickly and as excitingly as Ender's Game.

This game is a contrast of gameplay and creativity. In terms of innovation and originality, this goes beyond any platform/adventure game out there. First rate. The gameplay, itself, lacks a good deal of the substance and polish that a game of this type deserves.First off, I must say that this game has a well earned reputation for uniqueness and creativity. The level designs are really, really unique and at times amazing. There are two levels that I just loved. One required a lot amazing fast paced gliding, jumping and floating in a fun expansive environment. Another one required you to move around a game board and then shrink and travel around the game board and convince people to join an army so you can get another board piece. Those levels were flat out amazing and were nice breathes of fresh air. Almost all the levels have a central theme, and many of the levels tend to stretch the boundaries of physics and gravity. Some levels feel more like a Escher painting than a video game level.The characters are pretty fun, the story line is a nice little compliment, and the extremely colorful levels (which represent the people's minds as you travel inside them - thus the title) are definitive stand outs in this game. I wish most games would supply this attention to detail when it comes to visuals.The main character is a kid name Raz, and he travels throughout a summer camp and enters people's minds using various powers, ranging from the psychotically fun Levitation ball, to the almost useless fire starting power. He cycles through people' minds in order to become a true Psychonaut. Quite brilliant at some points.Their are a lot of problems though. The voice acting is very repetitive and many times grating. I often had my television remote next to me so I can mute it quickly. Almost headache inducing. The load times are terrible. Maybe the second worst loading times I've ever scene (Mafia for PS2 still is the worst). One particular mission was almost an 90s point and click adventure game, where you walk around and try one thing, then walk around and try another thing and continue until you find the right item. It may be fun for some people, but it breaks up the action. Also, since it is so creative, it tries to do things and sometimes fail miserably. There is one part where you follow a badly shaped bubble around the ocean and if you hit the edge, you drown. Not fun or interesting at all.The main problem, and it's a huge problem, is the fact the game plays like a second rate, cookie cutter platformer. A game where the mechanics and level design are flawed enough where you feel that your main enemy is bad game design and construction rather than jumps or real enemies. Grabbing something or landing on something on a jump almost feels random. Double jumping is a joke that only works one out of every three times. Camera movements often force you to make blind or awkward jumps, but more often than not, it will move unwillingly, causing you to fall as it moves in the middle of a jump. An annoying, practical amateur mistake that destroys all possibility of enjoyment in the last third of the game.All in all, it's a great attempt at an original game, but the rudimentary and buggy gameplay just places it in the realm of an average game.Pros:A couple of great levelsOriginal, unique, varied backgroundsFun conceptLevitation ball is really funUsually very little repetition of certain parts of levelsCons:Load times are horrendousVoice acting is grating and annoyingAdventure elements are boringHorrible cameraTerrible jumping mechanicsTerrible grabbing mechanicsDifficulty Level: MediumFrustration Level: MediumTime to Complete: 15 hours.

John Grisham is known for his quick reads and his fluidity. Good thing, because without it, this book would be lousy. You pretty much can predict the rest of this book from page 50, and the cliches are endless.Don't get me wrong, this is a good, lazy day read. It starts off well enough, like most Grisham novels, with a bit of action. A homeless man takes a law office hostage. He is later shot, but one of the hostages wonders why such a homeless man would target this office. What it turns out is that the homeless man was evicted from a slum by the same law office he works for. Through lies and deception, the law firm was indirectly responsible for his homelessness.Later, this overworked, yuppy lawyer goes to the homeless guy's community service lawyer, becomes enthralled with helping the poor man, becomes an idealist, unshackles himself from money, and on and on. Just fill in the other cliches you'd find in tons of other stories and that's this bookNo real surprises, and the ending is pretty obvious. The characters are either really good, or really evil, with no gray areas. You know the good guy wins, and the main character is going to help the little guy, so it's kind of pointless. But it's Grisham, so you'll be entertained.

A cop, who is haunted by a botched hostage negotiation leaves the force to work in a small town only to be dragged back into a hostage negotiation. That is what this whole book is about.It starts out well enough, with a few criminals going into a house and holding the family as hostage in order to beat out a murder charge. While not a bad novel, the sentence structure and fluidity tend to be terse and sometimes out of place. Crais also starts adding random complications that sort of pull the book away from the unlikely but possible to the almost absurd.It's a decent book, but Crais has done so much better.

I've read most of the Elvis Cole series, and this is by far one of the worst ones. This book has the feel of two different novels pasted together. The first half is very intriguing, where Elvis has to search for a Television star's biological parents. Elvis searches Louisiana and comes up with even more mysteries and secrets, making it interesting and a page turner. I almost felt the anxiety and the hot muggy air when I read the first half.Then, all of a sudden, a horrible travesty of a book breaks out. Suddenly, Elvis somehow becomes involved in multi mob-boss fighting and immigration issues involving government stings, racial tensions from long ago, and horribly over-sentimental goals. The fluidity of the book is lost. The motivations and character involvement's are convoluted at best. Compared to the first half of the book, the second half is pure garbage.Crais took a good book and sabotaged it.

The original Phantom of the Opera was a book about a sinister monster that terrorized an Opera and the love of his life. It was thrilling and theatrical at the same time, and a classic. This book is neither.Basically, the Phantom escapes death and becomes a millionaire in Manhattan. He anonymously builds an Opera House and persuades his former love to come back to perform. Then he tries to seduce the girl once again.The book is mostly a description of Erik's and his former lover's life. The thrills and the mystery are all gone. This book is barely a shell of its predecessor, and I don't recommend it all.

Most readers, like myself, probably don't share all of Michael Moore's political beliefs. This book is definitely left wing, but still will appeal to almost anyone. It crosses political lines by relying on one thing that will be accepted by all: humor.Moore attacks a wide group of companies, issues, and people, but not maliciously, but more humorously. Don't let that fool you though, his attacks are not light hearted. He goes after GM, Robert Dornan, Germany, and both political parties in a manner that is shocking by its humor and its truthfulness.Moore doesn't claim to be a great writer, but his writing style reflects the way is - common, and easy to understand. This makes this book not only funny, but very readable as well.Though pretty short, it's hilarious, original, and even provides some humorous pictures, mock trading cards, and mock articles. Check this book out and you'll most likely enjoy it, no matter what your political affiliation is.

I was thinking that a 900Mhz wireless headphone would at least equal the sound quality of a cheap, generic 900Mhz phone. Nope, not even close. While the headphone is comfortable, and looks pretty snazzy, this thing contains a lot of static. It will also intermittently pause and zone out, no matter how close you are to the antennae. The range is a joke. After 20 feet, it'll basically turn on and off. It's just a terrible product, and the only benefit I got was the knowledge that RCA actually has the gall to release such a shoddy product, so I can avoid that company from now on.

Well, like many who thought about buying this book, I watched Silence of the Lambs and read Hannibal. Great movie, great book. So, I decided to check this book out. Big mistake.There's not really anything good about this book. This book is extremely outdated, really slow, and not very fluid.It's amazing how a couple of decades could improve someone's writing style. Black Sunday, in terms or readability, is not up to par with many of the other books I have read. Normally, I wouldn't comment on this, but at some points it almost gave me a headache. Maybe I was having a bad week, but many sentances were very terse. I'm not an English professor, but let me give you an example. Harris, describing a character seeing a blimp up close for the first time: &quot;It was big. Fasil was reminded of his first view of an aircraft carrier.&quot; Why didn't he say something like, &quot;It's size reminded Fasil of the first aircraft carrier he saw.&quot;? Maybe I'm some type of picky freak, but when every other sentance is written with extra small words (e.g. of, his, was, an), and there are a lot of passive sentances, it kind of gets on your nerves.Adding to that is the lack of action and very little dialogue. I was reading about half as many pages per sitting as I usually do because of this. Except for the last twenty pages, the rest of the book could have been condensed into about 50 pages. Except for the details of Lander, the book is full of boring side stories about peripheral characters and annoying little details. I personally never cared about how a helicopter hoists roof parts or how a blimp works, but you'll learn it if you read this.Finally, this book is sort of outdated. You can't fault Harris for this, but it's worth noting. Though it doesn't really show up in the book (thankfully), the general plot (Middle Eastern terrorists trying to blow something up) sort of prays on the fears of the zenophobic middle American. It's a simple formula which I've seen many times, and has been done many times.So, if you're looking for another thrilling Hanibal Lector type novel, it would be best to pass on this one.

Yep, I bought all major Dave Matthews Band CDs releases. Why? Because I like them. Because they're CDs are usually worth it. Now they decided to implement DRM. First off, they sell well. Secondly, they are a touring band. So why implement DRM?I guess this is the digital equivalent of human waste from a tour bus, and consumers are the boat passengers. Basically, to play this on a PC machine, you need to install a product. The product has been known to crash machines. Gee, am I going to install it?If you have autorun on, it actually tries to install itself automatically. If I'm not mistaken, isn't that Spyware?Now I like to listen to CDs in my office on my windows machine. Am I going to install an unverified outside product on my machine connected to my employer's internal network? No, I'm not an idiot. Nor should you. Nor should anyone. It's dangerous. If it's not open source nor made by a reputable software organization, it may contain exploits or bugs that can open up your system, and your internal network to hackers. So unless your name is Paris Hilton and don't mind being hacked, don't do it.So, basically, it is unplayable, legally, on a normal PCs legally without compromising your system. Yep, I can now officially state that it is officially easier to download it illegally and burn it to a CD, than be a sucker like me and pay retail price. It shows the music industry has a little bit of greed, mixed with a whole lot of stupidity. I guess people like me, who respect copyrights, actually have to become hackers to enjoy legitimately paid music.Thanks Dave Matthews Band!Oh yeah, I've heard, though cannot confirm, that if you have a windows machine, and have an iPod, they are not compatible either. Hmmm, only 90% of all iPod users are like that. Another brilliant move there.This is basically trickery to install a pseudo-virus on your system. If your technically naive, you probably never disabled autorun for your CD, and it exploits that. So there is your warning, placing this CD with autorun enabled will install a hidden device manager without your permission. You have been warned. If you didn't understand what I said, then you've fell into the trap that DMB set out for you - annoyance by obfuscation.So, the bottom line is this. If the Dave Matthews Band doesn't want you to listen to their music, don't bother buying this "CD".

The first impression I had of this game wasn't very good. The graphics looked sub-par, and I couldn't hit anything. I just started and got creamed in the first level. The learning curve of such of game was too intense. Car combat is so simple, why should it take a while to get used to it? Anyway, with no advancement and no visual aesthetics, I quickly dismissed this game.Fortunately, I came back to it. I grew accustomed to the drab, gray graphics, I figured out some strategy, and I switched the difficulty to easy. What happened amazed me. This game which I thought was terrible turned out to be pretty good.You get to choose between around 12 different characters. Each character pretty much goes through the same levels, so once you've been through a few characters, you've seen all the levels in the game. Each character controls another car, and more importantly, gives you a cool movie describing his or her ordeal.These movies are what make the game. Though very, very short (nothing close to Final Fantasy X), these little 30-second clips are disturbing, intense, dark, and simply amazing. The credits, with a montage of the various cut scenes played to Rolling Stone's "Fade to Black" is worth the price of this relatively inexpensive game alone.Even though the graphics could have been better, and the game easier, playing a few characters is worth it. Though I would love to see all the movies, the game gets pretty repetitive. Despite these flaws, I recommend this game.Pros:MoviesEnding CreditsInteresting gameplayInteresting charactersDifficulty levelsSimple gameCons:Too gray and drabTakes forever to kill a vehicleInitial learning curveNot enough levels - repetitiveHours to complete: 6 hours for the first character, 2-4 hours for additional characters (12 characters total)Difficulty: Medium (for easy level)Frustration: Medium (mostly from the beginning)

In this really short book (115 pages), Cain describes how Huff, an insurance agent, teams up with a women to kill the women's husband and collect the insurance money. Being the man who sold the insurance policy, he designs an elaborate and almost fool proof murder in order to collect the money and get with the woman. Obviously, things don't quite as planned.This book is well written, compact, immensely readable. Full of intrigue, suspense, it's both smart and fun. The only problem I found was that I finished too quickly. This was suppose to be a weekend read and I finished it Saturday afternoon.All in all, it's the ultimate Noir book. The book emphasis the planning of the murder and double crossing that accompanies it. I would say you should read this right away.

David Eddings' continues this horrible series with the same style as before. They ride, the reader gets a boring description, the characters make bad, stale wisecracks, they learn some small bit of information, and continue on. All to fulfill a prophecy that is pretty much just like the one in the Belgarion. Every reader knows the outcome and the characters. Eddings just decides to painfully fill in the small, boring details.This time, the get kidnapped by the Mallorean Emporer, and learn about the raising of demons from one of the many random evil sorcerers placed throughout the series. Same old stuff really.There was one point of the story where Eddings' seemed to have started something interesting. He describes a plague outbreak and it's effect on a city. For twenty pages, the reader is glued to the book. But, unfortunately, the interesting sub-plot ends and the monotony continued.This book was about 400 pages, but only 10 pages mattered.

I saw the Phantom of the Opera about 3 years ago. It was my first and only musical, and I was thoroughly unimpressed. I came upon this book in the classics section of a bookstore, and lacking any reading material at the moment, I bought it on a whim. While the first fifty pages gave a false sense of an artsy motif, the rest of the book proved to be the quintessential horror book.How Andrew Lloyd Webber could make a musical out of a character so wicked, so amazingly brilliant and sinister is beyond me. It?s like a remake of Dracula where he goes on stage and starts break-dancing. It just doesn?t work.Despite the somewhat antiquated language (early 20th century, lots of passive sentences), the portrayal of the Opera Ghost is fantastic. The phantom is gradually exposed as to what he really is as the book progresses, ending in a dramatic rescue sequence. This book is like a combination of the Pit and the Pendulum and Dracula. Haunting, entertaining, and fast paced, it?s a shame that this book is more famous for its stage production than for its horror and imagination.If you?re looking for a complement to the musical, pass on this book. If you?re looking for a great horror and suspense novel, then I definitely recommend this book.

Despite the blatant fear mongering title, this book actually uses sound reasoning, statistics and facts to prove a point that houses are overvalued.Talbott gets into the increasing housing costs for individuals, especially the recent spike that economically doesn't make sense. He goes through the range of reasons, from the low interest rates, the stock market abandonment, to the increasing amounts of leverage. He then explains how those prices are out of range historically.The most impressive and eye opening part was the thorough and precise explanation of the inefficiency of the housing market. He goes through the irrationality of the current home owners, mortgage insurance companies, the bankruptcy system, and tells how the structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encourages increasingly risky and extended loans while shutting out healthy competition.The only disappointment was the fact that I was not convinced of a crash. He did an excellent job of showing the overpriced market, but gave no reason why a correction would be sudden or dramatic, as opposed to a gradual leveling off in a few years.All in all, it's an informative and worthwhile read.

One day I might want to start a business, and I wanted to get a feel of what to do. This book, however, did not provide it.This book mainly deals with generalities, and is more a definition of common sense than of how to start a business. Instead of concentrating on specifics, what forms to use, the amount of time to set it up, the cost, etc. It gives a very general, almost a "duh", feel to it.It's a small book, but the amount useful information presented is even smaller.

It starts at with a man being chased and caught by sleazy and mysterious kidnappers. It turns out this man ripped off his law firm of millions. Caught by his company and the US government, he works with a woman to keep his fortune and stay out of jail.Grisham spins a good tale. It starts out as a great adventure, then turns into a superb mystery, then through intrigue, subterfuge and a slow unraveling of the mystery, a law book emerges. Grisham, a great storyteller, doesn't let down in this book. The plot moves quickly and grabs the reader. A true page-turner.Any fan of Grisham, or good stories in general, should pick this up.

This book says it's a study guide for the Linux+ certification. Well, yes and no. It does explain the concepts of Linux, it does give a brief description of the test and has a CD that contains two sample tests. However, that's where the study guide ends. It's really a beginner's guide to Linux as opposed to a study guide.This book is very verbose in that it uses a lots of paragraphs as opposed to tables, lists, and definition. It's a good thorough read, but a terrible, terrible reference book. Designed for the absolute beginner, it's not for people who played with Linux and are trying to get certified. The first half of the book is extremely basic where it takes about 10 minutes of reading for anything particular concept to become apparent. The latter half is more advanced and informative, but without simple tables and references, much of the information is lost in the needless rambling.The worst parts are the review sections. The summaries at the end of the chapter are really lacking. So while concepts are explained well, the details (e.g. where are the system logs, how to alter the init level scripts) are hidden within chapters.The practice tests are good, but the difficulty between the end of chapter tests and the practice tests are huge.A study guide needs to be full of facts, easily searchable, concise, and contain a lot of information. This book only fulfills the latter requirement.

The Super Mario Kart of SNES days, despite the cartoonish nature of it, was perhaps the greatest racing game ever. In my time, it was a college dorm staple. The battles were just a medium for trash talking, the time trials were a measure of pure skill, and the races were a great combination of both. Very rarely does a game reward skill. When the N64 version came out, it came out with a collective, "ughh". While darn good looking, much of the skill was replaced by luck, and it just wasn't as fun.Now the latest incantation is for the Gamecube. Sure, Nintendo is no longer the only major player in the video game market, but it still shines. This game still relies a lot on luck, and the power slide of yesteryears have been replaced by a useless unintuitive turn boost. The Super Nintendo version had different levels of characters, where the ultimate goal was to master the clunky but amazingly fast Bowser and Donkey Kong Jr. Now, even though there are more characters, the AI and lack of a power slide removes all motivation to switch from the lighter ones, reducing replayability. The battles are good though. I especially enjoy the bomb battles, but the lack of good levels severely limits the playability.The worst part of the AI is what I like to call the "Colorado Rockies Pitchers" syndrome, where if you get hit once, you get hit over and over again. The second you get caught in the pack, it's over. It's very common to get hit once with a red shell, then before you start again, get hit by a start, a green shell, a red shell, and hit by lightning, throwing you into last place. It sucks.With all its faults, it's still darn fun and is pretty easy to pass all the levels. Probably the best non-shooting multi-player game out there at this time.Pros:Good looking.Still fun.Cons:Cheap AI.The larger characters are not fun.Needs more battle levels.No power slide.

The 2 Player Cooperative Genre is a small genre indeed. It had it's fun in Arcades with such games like Gauntlet. It was popular in the Nintendo world with Ikari Warriors and other hack and slash games as well. Socom is probably the best multiplayer cooperative, but requires online play, and really isn't fun when two players are in the same room. Games such as Desert Conflict 2 could have been perfect if they got the level design and save points correctly, but the genre never reached that pivotal point until now.Granted it's not perfect, but it sure is fun and mesmerizing while it lasts. First off, the atmosphere is amazing. It really feels like you're in the jungle with all these enemies in camouflage attacking you. There is a bit of strategy involved as you have to discuss who goes where and who gets health. The game only ends when both players die, so sometimes you have stay back to let the other one take the hits. Really fun. Most levels require trekking through a jungle, fighting enemies, and completing objectives. The graphics and scenery are not only fitting, but play well with the level design perfectly.Yes, there is also a single person mode, but from what I hear, it's nothing compared to Medal of Honor: Frontline.Here's the bad though: The gun controls (I use a standard PS2 controller), are jerky, and the player's movements are a bit too slow. The first level consists of you walking up a ship and then firing lots of gun fire from stationary guns. While the atmosphere is beyond impressive, it gets old after a while. There are about 5-6 missions total, and unfortunately, a friend and I finished it just 5 hours on the normal setting.There is also online play, which is somewhat cool in that exists. The online play, however, only consists or Quake like deathmatch and team deathmatches. No cooperative level game play like Socom. Unfortunately, the people who do play are not that fun to talk to, and are quite the First Person Shooter Nerds who will kill you as soon as you turn a corner. It really only works when you can get enough people for a private room.All in all, it's a great game with great atmosphere, but way too short.Pros:Great atmosphereSuperb two player cooperative modeAt least has some type of online playLevels are intuitiveCons:Way Too shortFirst two missions are pointlessSave points have to be found, cannot save anywhereJerky gun controlsOnline play is boring, ruined by FPS nerdsHours to Complete (Cooperative): 5 hours (normal setting)Difficulty Level: EasyFrustration Level: Non-existent

When I saw commercials for "24" a while back, I thought Fox just created another awful show. In fact, the initial ratings were so bad that there was a distinct chance that 24 would only last 13 episodes (Fox only ordered 13 episodes to start with). Well, as we all know, it did finish, and they started a new season. I was shocked because all signs showed that "24" would not have been renewed. Then it occurred to me - they might have kept it around because it was good.Critics were saying it's a great show, but then again, these were the same critics that found shows like "Will and Grace" funny, so I gave them no thought. Out of pure boredom I rented the first disc. I was instantly hooked. This series was unique. Every scene was action-packed, fast paced, intriguing, smart, and well written. When I say fast paced and action packed, I'm not talking about mindless explosions, senseless killings, and pointless car chases. I'm speaking of mystery, fallibility, surprises, and suspense. This series is filled with twists and turns, but unlike ever-other show with twists and turns, these twists enhance the plot, force us to think, and are never, ever contrived.The show concerns an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate, which mingles the lives of Jack Bauer, his wife, his daughter, his coworkers, the terrorists, and the presidential candidates' family. Unlike a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, this movie avoids every clich&eacute; in the book. Characters development occurs, and people's true colors, motivations, failings, and strengths all show up. The typical dividing line between good and bad is divided and spliced with every episode. The best way to put it is that the real-time action kept me on the edge of the seat, the plot and characters kept me hooked.There were some flaws with it. After the 13th episode, there was a considerable drop-off in quality (a character suffered amnesia for a while, causing me to say "oh no"), but the final episodes put the series back on track.DVD, not TV, is the best way to watch it. It is something that deserves your full attention, and should not be spread out over 24 weeks with commercial interruptions. In terms of extras, this DVD does offer much, except an alternative ending and a small commercial, but then again, it doesn't need to.So quit reading this and start watching "24"! It's the greatest action show ever!

I liked this book because it was a page-turner. I hated this book because it really wasn't funny or interesting or intriguing. It's not a bad book, just a book worthy of Tom Arnold's semi-celebrity.First off, it's small, quick, and fluid and very readable. That's always a huge plus. Also, a few of the stories are fun, like the parking war with the Seinfield cast.Here's the bad. Tom likes to discuss his views and family, friendship, and how to live life. Of all the people in the world, why would I want to know Tom Arnold's opinion on this topic? Also, many of his stories and family problems are just not interesting. He speaks in general terms, instead of getting into funny specific stories. Finally, it dawned on me that his life is just not interesting, and it shows.It's a good page-turner, occasionally funny, but not something I could recommend to everyone.

I went to the bookstore and picked up a random Grisham novel. Little did I know that this book had nothing to do with the law. It took me a good two hundred pages to figure it out. The biggest surprise was the fact that this book was the best book I read from him. Grisham proves his worth as a storyteller by providing the simplest story of all - a seven-year-old farm boy's autumn.While Grisham's greatest strength is his knack for telling a good story, his law novels often go beyond the usual and norm to present an almost unlikely scenario. This book simply relies on the accounts of a boy whose life is extraordinary by being almost ordinary. And Grisham pulls this off very well.A boy, living with his parents and grandparents, deals with a typical farmer's struggle - picking season. The family deals with debt, Mexican and hillbilly laborers, townspeople, neighbors, secret affairs, and even a murder. Grisham expertly depicts the simple life of the farmer intermingled with the complexities of rural survival. From the murder of a brutish laborer, to the kid's first glimpse of television, the book's range from action to touching.A simple book by a great storyteller, I recommend this book to all.

A man goes into surgery to correct his psychotic rage, but the surgery takes a turn for the worse. He escapes and terrorizes everyone. In this small book, Crichton spends entirely too much time describing the medical procedures, the hospital politics, and the doctors themselves, while little time on the action or suspense.Usually, Crichton incorporates background and scientific information to further the plot and intrigue and suspense. Unfortunately, this book is more about the hospital than about the plot. The plot itself doesn't even contain an engrossing manhunt or chase that one would expect with an escaped maniac.It's not all bad. It is very much readable, and like most Crichton books, it's fluid and enjoyable.I'd suggest other Crichton books first, but overall, I would half heatedly recommend this.

Steinback does something very few people could do. He writes an interesting novel with some uninteresting people. He starts off with Danny, a man who fortunately or unfortunately inherits two houses. A fire by his friend leaves him with only one house, and eventually a multitude of friends finds themselves staying with him.I'd like to consider Danny and his friends the original slackers, the pre-cursors to Beavis and Butt-Head. The sole purpose of Danny and his friends' life is to drink wine and leave all their cares behind. They go through, talk about, or hear about all sorts of little adventures. Some of these adventures revolve around getting drunk, some are more serious, and some are even more hilarious.Through this series of time, Danny and his friends foster friendship and camaraderie, and even at points seem to develop a conscience. Heartwarming, funny, and in the end, tragic, this is a decent novel.Unfortunately, this novel just didn't have the pace of which a good book should. Also, the characters, with the exception of the ending and of the Pirate, didn't elicit much emotion, sympathy, or intrigue. In the end, this book is about those characters, and could have delivered more.I would marginally recommend this tale about some poor paisanos in a poor area called Tortilla flat. Though not captivating, it is interesting and original.

This is one of those books that you read, and after you're finished, you're not sure if you liked it or not. It wasn't great, but there is nothing really wrong with it. It wasn't boring, it didn't drag on, but it also didn't captivate you.A detective is working on a case similar to those annoying rich girl missing girl cases that randomly appears everywhere. This book explores this Scottish case, along with some internal police politics, and the lives of a few detectives. Intermingling clues concerning dolls, autopsies, and an Internet game all come together to help solve the mystery.As with any mystery, the main part is the ending, and even though not terrible, it is pretty contrived and non-climatic.

I fully admit my grammatical failings. I admit it, I'm just not that good. So, I figured that I could polish up on my weakness by reading this book. Did it help? Yes, and no. It did provide a lot of common problems and it did clarify when to use many words (e.g. I versus me, them versus they), and unlike many other books that take dry reference materials and tranform them into readable books, it has a good glossary! The first few chapter provided a lot of good info and was suprisingly fluid.After the first few chapters, the book gets really, well, boring. About 30 pages are devoted to words that are often mistaken for one another. Many of them I already knew, and I just trudged through word after word. It kind of felt like the I was reading a dictionary.I also found that tenses and verbs could have been expanded on. She also tends to look at a sentence on a micro scale, which particular word is wrong or which particular sentence is right or wrong. I was hoping for at least some attempt at a macro approach towards sentence structure.She also delves into punctuation, which is great for reference. She, however, then delves into cliches and e-mail problems. These two chapters sort of felt added on and really didn't teach me much.All in all, it's decent. It's full of good information, and for what it's about, it's pretty reasonable to read from cover to cover.

The fourth book of the Elvis Cole series is one of the better ones. A crime, mystery, detective, and police adventure all rolled into one. Elvis meets a pretty young girl (as always), and seems to have easily solved a case. The young girl isn't convinced of such an easy solution, and from that follows is a great mystery and action sequence.Corrupt cops, inner city violence, gang warfare, the sarcastic Elvis Cole, and the mysterious Joe Pike all combine to make this a great who done it. The violence, action and intrigue grow as each page turns. This novel is one of the best mysteries I've read; it's quick, with great plot and description.I would recommend this book, along with L.A Requiem, as the two Elvis Cole that are must reads for detective and mystery or police fans

Living in California, I sense the extreme hypocrisy amongst many of the state's residents. This is a state with a large population from out of state yet has a tendency to be isolationist at times. A place that votes largely liberal, yet only a few years ago passed the extremely controversial and conservative Prop. 187. A place that is expensive to live, yet relies on low-paid illegal immigrants to shoulder much of the low end jobs. This is what Boyle brings out in this book; a book about two simple couples living on the outskirts of Los Angeles.Boyle describes a typical yuppie upper-middle class couple who moved to the outskirts to avoid urban living. The typical "White Flight" family. He describes an incident where the man from this couple runs his car into the an illegal immigrant, his exact counterpart. While the white couple has everything and lives a very posh yet uneventful live, the illegal immigrant and his wife exist on the opposite end of the spectrum, living in extreme poverty and hardship. Boyle does a wonderful job of splicing those two different ways of life together to further show the economic and class divide without explicit political pandering. He also manages to show the transformation of well off individual who is open minded to a man who is borderline racist.While good, the main problem is that the two extremes are overdone. Without going into details, the hardships on the illegal immigrant couple are so increasingly sad and horrendous that it borders on ridiculous and moves to the realm unbelievable. On the other end of the spectrum, the white couple's "problems" are so vain that reading about them is pure drudgery at times. For example, he goes into much detail, pages and pages, about a wall being built. If he toned down the dullness on one end, and the horrors on the other, the credibility and believability would become vastly apparent.All in all it's a decent book, but could have been much better.

In this book, Lawrence Taylor goes into his life of drugs, fast cars, lots of woman, and tons of money. He describes his life, but with not so much detail. In fact, a chunck of his book are actually quotes from other people intermingled within his text. The book is about 250 pages long with a large font. I bought so it would last me a while, but I started reading it at noon, and finished it before dinner.The third person quotes are what really got to me. A portion of the quotes are self promoting, and other quotes just repeat what LT described in the previous paragraph. They hardly provided any insight into LT, but ruined the flow and continuity of the book in general.The lack of detail is also apparent. There are many references to how fast he was and how he revolutionized the game, but he provides no expansion of this. No information on how fast he ran, or how much he can bench press, or what types of plays he helped revolutionize. In terms of a football book, it's virtually non-existent. He doesn't go into much detail on other parts of the books as well. He describes a lot of parties, bar hopping, fast driving, and throws a few general stories in there, but with only a few exception, nothing specific to hold on to.Another bad part of this book is that in the end, he tries to evoke sympathy to which no one really can't.This brings it back to his life story. The most admirable aspect of the book is that he is very honest with himself. He knew cocaine destroyed him, and sometimes goes into some depressing stories. He knew he was lazy sometimes, but he still played hard.All in all, it's short, but extremely readable. It's more of an outline than a full fledged expose, but it's honest and somewhat shocking nonetheless.

Binx Bolling is suffering a pre-mid life crises, where his whole life is a mere nothing of what he expects. Through the novel, he tries to find meaning and takes a spur of the moment trip to New Orleans with a girl named Kate. Though it deals with an issue that concerns us all at one point of our life - the absence of purpose, it does it in a way that is too unreadable to really enjoy Percy's vision.Though I liked the message, I felt that the plot, if you want to call it a plot, didn't move. Granted, Percy is not trying to tell a story but portray a critical point of one man's life, the novel doesn't grab the reader's attention. It's not a light read, and this is a real disservice because it deals with a concern that many more people could relate to.

Though the beginning looked like a continuation of Orson Scott Card's philisophical writings disguised as a novel, this book progress to a pretty good book. Though not as well done as Ender's Game, it's still intelligent and well thought out.Though Card continues his thoughts about religion, family, and morality, much to the reader's chagrin, he finally moves back to more action, plot, and fluidity.This book deals with who has the right to survice, something Speaker for the Dead failed to draw the reader to. There is no good or bad presented in this book, but instead it's a battle of interpertation for what is right for humanity and the universe.One of the only real flaws of this book are the impossible ending, and Card's reliance and constant explanation of his own psuedo-science. A good science fiction book must be believable at least.

Mario Puzo, the author of the Godfather, reproduces the organized crime formula is this great read. Though the plot is not exceptional, Puzo's writing is very fluid and exciting.The major strength of this book is its readability. The book moves along in a nice pace, with lots of action and dialogue. The characters are also unique and intriguing. Included are the mysteriousness of the mob and their family values, and the ruthlessness of Hollywood, which makes this book a fun weekend read.The one weakness is that the plot is lacking. The main conflict between the two cousins only comes to light near the end of the book. Though the side plots are interesting, the combination of it all makes it a weak overall story at best.All in all, I would recommend this book as one of those books to read on a lazy day right next to the pool or on the beach.

This book is an interesting humor book. Part joke book, part biography, part short storeis. It's three short books combined into one. The first part is by the most hilarious. Just pure, uncensored hilarity. I got a great kick about how he made 101 jokes about how big one certain body part was.The second part is not the best part, but it sheds some light on who Drew Carey is, and what the show is all about. It's not the highlight of the book, but even Drew Carey grudgingly admits he didn't want to put it in but felt obliged to.The third part is suprisingly good. He writes about 4 short stories that, though not humorous, are interesting. It's classic blue collar literature. &quot;Tackling Jim Brown&quot; should by all means be considered a classic.Check out the book, and you can show why Drew Carey has a highly rated show and is a great stand up comic.

This was my first Christopher Moore book, and may be my last. This book started off good enough, I liked the people, their situation, and the interactions between each one. It started off as a good, somewhat humorous tale about whaling research. Funny, amusing - pretty much what I hoped for.Then all of sudden, the plot went out there. The second half of the book was a giant, "what the heck is this?". From whaling research in Hawaii, it switches to a story about whale boy hybrids, giant Goos controlling the seas, and Amelia Earhart. It just was too out there to be interesting or funny.

While readable, and a good continuation of the Pawn of Prophecy, the second book of the Belgariad series tends to drag a bit.This book is still a darn good book. However, it does tend to be a book where a group of people travels, and that's it. They travel a road, find some enemies and either kill them or outwit them. Three hundred pages of this turns out to be monotonous at times.The story is still overall very captivating. The innocent farm boy, Garion, starts to learn of his powers, his inner being, and his epic mission as he encounters new beings and goes through many different adventures. The description of the jungles of Nyissa alone near the end of the book is worth the price alone.Without giving too much away, this book continues Edding's exciting series and I would highly recommend this book.

I can't wait for Jayson Williams' to describe his prison sentence, from his takes on soap on a rope, to prison food; it will be a laugh riot.Seriously, this book provides insight to Williams' personal and professional life, along with life in the NBA. This book is full of one to two page stories concerning a wide range of stories, from truly touching, to laugh out loud.One story describes how he was about to kill the murderer of his two sisters, only to let him go. Another story tells how he was so drunk, he woke in Phoenix thinking that he was in New York after a bomb blast. When meeting the GM of the Suns for the first time, he asked if he could call his Mom to see if she was alright, in which afterwards he was promptly traded.This book is full of very interesting tales that turn this into a great page-turner. This is truly one of the greatest sports books of all time. He doesn't glorify or vilify anyone, he just tells it how it is.If he comes out with another book, I'll be the first one to pick it up at the store. You can drive, while I'll take shotgun (get it?).This is the ultimate book for anyone who likes sports.

This book doesn't really have great character development, the plot is not the best in the world, but it is a great read.This is one of those books that you crack open on Sunday 10:00AM, and wrap it right before the Simpsons start. It'll chew up your whole day because you won't be able to put it down, but it'll be worth it.It's basically about an adopted son who takes the place of a murdered Don, and takes it upon himself to get revenge against the murderers and save the Don's business. Granted, the plot is vary formuliac, but it still grips the reader like very few books.This book is not a literary masterpiece, but that really is a blessing in disguise. Puzo does a great job by not detracting from the plot. He doesn't concentrate on settings or development, but instead puts all his effort in to telling a great story.It's a great way to spend a free day, and a fitting way to end Puzo's career.

Okay, there are two camps of people out there. The increasingly growing number of people who love Madden and hate the NFL 2K series, and the increasingly shrinking number of people who love the NFL 2K series, but hate Madden. I can say I belong to neither. I loved Madden '97 for the PC, but Madden 2001 for the PC was beyond terrible. I really enjoyed NFL 2K and 2K1, but NFL 2K3 has got to be of one the worst sequels of all time - up there with the Attack of the Clones.So, I bought Madden 2003 a month and a half ago. While it's not a great game, it certainly is no slouch. Here are my thoughts and observations after 3+ seasons in Franchise mode.So, I started off in Pro level, and finished 6-10. The next season I won the Super Bowl with 12-4 record. Woohoo! My final season, I switched to All-Pro level, and won the Super Bowl with a 14-2 record. Woohoo? I thought that it was strange that I did better switching from Pro to All Pro. Then I played half a game in All Madden. I went long ever play, completed 278 yards of passing and ended with a 156 QB rating by the end of the half. I stopped the game because I knew this game was screwy.First off, there is an overwhelming abundance of useless and annoying bells and whistles. For example, before many plays, they throw some statistics on the screen like 3rd down conversions percentage or something like that. While that is somewhat interesting, it blocks your sight and you can't see the opposing formation. You either have to call an audible and cancel, or wait for the stats to disappear, all the while the play clock is running. Worst off, you cannot turn it off. Also, there's the music. While some of the songs are good, there are some extremely girly bands out there that don't deserve to be associated with a manly game like Football. Good Charlotte and Bon Jovi should just stick with MTV and leave me alone in my own bastion of masculinity. Fortunately, you can actually turn the music off. Other things, like challenges are annoying. Why have referee induced instant replay challenges? In real football, referees sometimes challenge themselves because they need to refer to instant reply with less than 2 minutes left in the half. In Madden, the same game that renders the image controls the referee. It should be 100 percent accurate. It shouldn't correct itself and force me to watch a stupid video of itself challenging itself and telling itself that it's overturned. Absolutely pointless. There's also pointless things like Madden challenges and Madden cards which really detract from the core football game.After the forty odd games of playing, I learned that offense was really, really easy. For some reason, the computer had this overwhelming urge to stop the run. It would set up some tough, tough run defenses. My average was a mere 2.5 yards a carry. So I did the logical thing, I passed. The computer never adapted. I had an arsenal of about 4 plays that consisted 80% of my downs because the AI would refuse to adapt to my game play. The game really sides with long passes. Couple this with the fact that in harder levels, players would just drop catches, and the overall lack of YAC yards, it pretty much renders high percentage West Coast style offenses useless. The AI is just begging you to turn into Steve Spurrier and go Fun-and-Gun on them. You can toss it up forty yards all the time, and never worry about an interception.Defense is another matter. Sacks for either side are rare indeed. The corners were just plain dumb and half the time are just plain useless either whether the computer controls the CB or whether you do. Penetrating the defensive line was really difficult. Stopping a drive was hard. You had to hope the computer ran a lot, the running backs or O-line would miss the blitzing linebacker or cornerback on passing plays, and that the receivers would drop balls passed right to them.Finally, some parts of the game were just whacked. It seems to be obsessed with inches to go. Every drive I would have at least one or two 3rd and inches. Sometimes, a couple of players on either side would turn themselves into Jesus with a helmet. Those usually accounted for my losses. When one of my receivers turned into Jesus, I would pass to him all day long and be assured of a completion. Also, the computer liked throwing in artificial suspense. For example - the last two minutes of my last Super Bowl. Even though there were no turnovers in the game until then, in just the final two minutes, there was a fumble, an interception when the ball bounced off the receivers helmet, another two separate defensive interceptions in the offensive endzone, a punt return of 51 yards, and two timely penalties that stopped the clock so the other teams last second drive can continue. If that is not artificially induced, then the laws of mathematics have changed. I learned that in order to avoid this, I just made sure to kill time in last quarter of the game, instead of actually playing the game itself.Okay, now for the good. This is NOT NFL 2k3. Which means it's playable and enjoyable and you progressively improve - as opposed to Sega's bankruptcy inducing debacle. Also, the online is suppose to be really good, and it's free until August 2003. Reading the receivers on offense is very intuitive and fun. The franchise mode is also interesting. Drafting, though time consuming, is worthwhile. You can really define your franchise for years to come. The mini camp and football 101 are great ways to familiarize yourself with the game. Practicing and mastering this game is worthwhile as well. The graphics are decent, and the stadiums and field are nice as well.All in all, it's the best new football game out there, but it's got a lot of flaws to get around.

This game is a very, very simple platform game. But it's also pretty darn good. The cell shading graphics are simply amazing, and the gameplay is consistent, fun, and easy to begin with. It's a little platform game that combines elements of stealth and action. Sort of like Metal Gear Solid 2, but actually fun.This game is a short game. It means that maybe they could have added another element, but it also means that there isn't needless repetition in any of the levels, except for the last boss.You are this raccoon from a long line of thieving relatives. You're mission is to find all parts of the secret family thieving book, all while running away from a female cop who is constantly on your tail (I'll let you decipher the meaning of that sentence yourself).The thing that strikes me most is the presentation of the characters. While the background consists of 3-D objects, the characters are smooth, cartoon like, cell-shaded animals. It's a nice change. It's especially pleasing since the new, unreleased Zelda is going to use this type of "revolutionary" technology.The game itself is straightforward. You have to jump, attack, and sneak your way through levels to eventually reach a boss. Then once you realize how to defeat the boss, it's on to the next level. Nothing original at all, but then again, it didn't claim to be. The beauty of this is that you rarely go through the same level more than three times, and you don't have to refer to walkthrough to pass any of the levels.I would recommend this, it's good, clean fun.

This game is a very, very simple platform game. But it's also pretty darn good. The cell shading graphics are simply amazing, and the gameplay is consistent, fun, and easy to begin with. It's a little platform game that combines elements of stealth and action. Sort of like Metal Gear Solid 2, but actually fun.This game is a short game.

I am honestly shocked that Puzo wrote this book. Though not finished by any means, this book is completely below his standards. This is a book about a renascence pope during the and his three most beloved children.For a book in a different time and place, it does little to provide a general feel for the scenery and situation. For a book with interesting characters, it does little to make us feel sympathy or hatred towards them. For a book about war, sex, betrayal, deceit, it's very tame and very boring.The book starts of badly. It basically describes the Rodrigo Borgias family in a sort of adult "See spot run" way. He doesn't delve into stories or personal insights, but just blandly describes facts as is. The middle is even worse, where Puzo seems almost infatuated with an incestual relationship that unfortunately lasts for the entire book.The book gets better in the latter half. Finally, a plot of some sorts starts to develop, and character development comes to fruition. Unfortunately, it still falls very short from being interesting. The "battles" are really not anything, the family deceit is really just grazed upon, and the setting is passed by as if it was nothing. Couple this with the fact that he added characters or reference to people like Michaeveli, Michaelangelo, and Da Vinci made it seem like he was reaching for something that wasn't there.I'd pass on this book. I prefer to remember Puzo for the Godfather or The Fortunate Pilgrim.

I don't get how this is the same show. Season 1 introduced a simple premise and added layers of complexity. Season 2 took that premise, expanded upon, and introduced the war as a single thread, where little battles won here and there, and little bits of information seemingly turning the tide of the war. In fact, these two seasons reminded me a Seven Samurai type series, where intelligence, tactics, strategy, and personal styles subtlety turn the tide of war. Those two seasons exceeded my wildest expectations.Now, this is season 3. Boy, the producers and writers really just dismissed the concept of the show and almost everything we invested in it. Spoilers below. Most of the things that made the show great are just tossed aside for pointless religious concepts or stand-alone shows that go nowhere.You know how Boomer, the central figure of Cylone/human defining moments, the one that brought the whole humanity question involved? Well, the writers basically said FRAK YOU and kind of dismissed her. Uh, okay.You know how the show barely showed the enemy, only letting us see the small details that mattered, giving enough to whet our appetites? Well, FRAK YOU, now, whole plots revolve around it, and they're just a bunch of babbling idiots. Uh, thanksYou know how they worked really hard to destroy a few enemy Baseships? How they sacrificed an entire battleship to take two out? Well, guess what? They're like 40 of them, so that sacrifice was absolutely pointless. Another Fraking insult.You know this show defied conventional standards? Well, the Frak you again. The first 3 or 4 episodes are pretty much a shoot `em up action. The last two episodes? A trial, where, sticking with a stereotypical boringness, ends with a "emotional compelling dialogue presented from the witness stand". You know, like every Fraking courtroom drama created.You know who Tom Szerek fought long and hard, with campaigns and assassinations attempts to become president? Well Frak your memory, you're suppose to forget that. Szerek actually becomes president, and then just gives it up in a minute. WTF? Oh, then he gets power hungry later, in season 4, so it further insults your intelligence.And the worst thing of all were the two virus episodes. This is true jump the shark territory. You know how the show tries to throw in little morality? Well, they got really full of themselves and thought they could throw in immensely stupid "moral questions". Basically, they can easily win the war by introducing a virus into the Cylons and end it all. Well, the writers say Frak you to your intellect, and want you to conveniently forget that all the episodes before involved "Cylon genocide" (e.g. destroying a resurrection ship), and almost all the episodes afterwards are involve "genocide" (e.g. especially in season 4, with the destruction of the resurrection hub), but suddenly, these two episodes, "Cylon genocide" is bad. Just lazy writing that really annoyed me.And many of the shows were completely wasted. Another Frak you to those who want continue the saga. There was a whole show about a doctor who intentionally kills random people from one planet, and other episodes where Baltar mumbles into bed with two female Cylons.This season by itself was bad, but that it took a great show down with it just kills me. With the exception of about a half hour of good, informational material, this entire season could actual be dismissed and Battlestar Galactica would be better.

I kept hearing stuff about Halo, people saying it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Well, when I did see it, I thought that it was pretty underwhelmed. Graphics were decent, but the settings, scenery, and enemies were pretty blah. It seemed like someone took the worst of the Sci-Fi network and the Phantom Menace and made it a game.Then I saw TimeSplitters 2. Wow. The graphics and scenery are spectacular, the characters and enemies are various (I prefer controlling a monkey), and the two player mode is by far the best of any console game. There's a map editor, there are numerous modes, including cooperative and non-coop deathmatch, cooperative and non-cooperative capture the flag, who can hold the flag the longest, and much more. The Mexican Hacienda capture the flag mission alone is worth the price of the game.The gameplay is smooth, the weapons vary, and within minutes, a friend and I were hooked on capture the flag.The game is based on some sort of time travel plot. I had no interest in the FMV, so I skipped all the movies. At least that provided an excuse to provide gorgeous settings and levels. Unlike games like Max Payne or Metal Gear Solid 3, the settings are not drab and one dimensional, but vibrant and interesting. From a western setting, to an ice field, to the streets of 1930s Chicago, to the Aztec rain forest, the backgrounds were rendered seamlessly and flawlessly.The single level mode is fun too. Sometimes it require some exploration, but it's still very easy on the easy level. A little too fun. I completed the two thirds of the game in one sitting. But, if you want a challenge, want to spend more time on it, and more rooms to explore, you can choose a harder level. There are about 10 levels, all in different times and settings.

Once sentence captures it all - "Pretty lame - Millhouse". (For those who are Simpson illiterates, that's Mrs. Krabapple describing Millhouse's science fair project. Millhouse bellows "Behold the power of gravity!", and then lets a slinky step once down a ramp.)There are so many great games that I wish they would copy and insert Simpsons characters in. The only time I ever played Doom on the PC was when someone installed the Simpson?s wad. To be Homer Simpson and to fight giant Flanders throwing Bibles at you me was great fun. Of course, when they blatantly copied a game, they had to blatantly copy one of the worst games out there - Crazy Taxi. Why couldn't they copy something good, like Grand Theft Auto 3. They could have had a hit with Grand Theft Donut.The fact it's the Simpsons and you drive through Springfield is pretty cool. That's about it. The 10 missions levels are decent enough to finish, but aren't exactly fun. The graphics are decent, and they actually have the characters speak which is somewhat fun, though not clever or laugh out loud funny.The main game consists of getting money to unlock cars and levels and to get one million dollars. Each time you go through a run, you gain about $6000. The run takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Every 20-30 grand, you can unlock a new level or a new character. The unfortunate thing is that after 10 rounds, you've done pretty much all there is to do, and the novelty factor wears off. I got up to $70,000 before being thoroughly bored with this game. There was no way I was going to unlock all six levels and all seventeen characters. No way would I even consider trying to get one million dollars, the monotony would have killed me.The Simpsons' Road Rage is a game that gets old really, really fast. It's fun for about 5 hours max. Rent it if you're curious, but you'll be disappointed.

This game requires that you insert software and go through a series of motions to start a game. So basically, it turns a simple thing like turning on the PS2 into an annoying little exercise that requires you to babysit the console for at least a minues. Of course, the box mentions nothing of this, and successfully hides the CD that you need place in you console at the start of the powercycle. Worst of all, the package is designed in such a way that in order to even discover this, you'd have to tear apart the plastic box, making it impossible to return.Granted, it works, but it's just damn annoying. Would you buy a car if it required you to crank start the vehicle? Would you at least want to know about? At least it's readily available, unlike other useful memory cards. Of course the main selling point is that it contains 16MB of data. Who cares? Does anyone really use up all their 8MB memory card?Needless to say, the second I saw a Sony memory card, I grabbed that and never used this piece of garbage again.Even if you don't mind the extra annoyance of the loading time, you should NOT buy this product. It will only encourage companies to deceive customers.

Yes, this is a joke CD. Stephan Hawking as a gangsta rapper. This sounds like a joke that would get old, say, after the first 20 seconds. But you know, it works. This is one the best rap records I've bought in a long time. I don't know what this means for the current state of rap and hip-hop, but I just plain enjoyed this CD.First off, this is a funny CD. Yeah, the premise is lame, but the smart lyrics mixed with the pure absudity makes it a perfect "smart-stupid" comedy. The lyrics are either based on gangster rap, quantum physics, or other innane topics like Grand Theft Auto. You will be chanting "You down with entropy, yeah you know me, who's down with entropy, every last homie". This is, however, mostly original music.Now don't let the joke motif fool you. Sure, this is not gangsta rap, but I find this less absurd than a guy who's been shot nine times who can barely ennuciate words making millions of dollars. The beats are fantastic, and the Stephan Hawking voice is more like a techno laced rapper that suprisingly well. I'd consider this "alternative-rap", not satire.The CD has about 13 songs, each with varying degrees of beats, funk, speed, and the like. The creator spent time and effort on this - and it shows. Most people will write this off as an attempt at humor. I'd say this is a piece of inventive art.

They finally reach the final battle. Even the characters in this book admit the battle and the series is just like the Belgarion series. That's pathetic. You should already know who wins and what happens.They finally get to the Place Which is No More, and in an utterly anti-climactic scene, good defeats evil, and a new God is made.The ending is boring, surreal, unsatisfying, and actually occurs in the middle of the book. The reader must endure an extra hundred pages of fluff about weddings and ships in order to finish this series.After reading this whole series, I felt like I wasted a good 40 hours of my life. Like me, you'll probably never touch a David Eddings' book again.If you are curious, just ask someone about the series. They should be able to explain it all in about two minutes. No joke.

This supposed horror book isn't a horror book. It's more like a description of an acid trip than anything else. A university professor, recovering from malaria, is fired for a controversial paper deriding idols and artifacts of certain gods. Apparently, this angers some spirits, and after seemingly losing a few hours of his life and his hat, he descends (literally) into a world of weird characters and doors and life forces involving his wife and best friend.It's hard not to give away the plot, because the plot is only revealed in the end. It's basically a few huge extremely strange events in one book.Even though the imagery is very good for this short, Hubbard's language is a little terse and antiquated to make it a quick read. Though overall pretty interesting, I would not recommend this, as I wouldn't know what to classify it as.

It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better. Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea. Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all. It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected. The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf. Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag. Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag. Why? Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor. You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person. This mug solve the single serving dilemma. It's big, sturdy, and made of glass. The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser. It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug. Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there. The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank. The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink. If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes. No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out. Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down until the desired temperature is reached. Count those seconds. Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug. Easy.I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one. My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer. Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.

This short book describes the history and events that led to and include the overthrow of the Iranian democratic government of Mossadegh in fifties. Kezner describes not only the overthrow concocted by CIA, but the previous events of early Iranian history, British colonialism, corrupt oil deals, and the future ramifications of the overthrow.This book is a very concise history book. Out of the 200 pages, only about fifty concern the actual overthrow. It's much less a description of the overthrow than a sociological and psychological description and analysis of how the revolution occurred and whether it was a viable option to combat communism, or just an excuse to exploit a small country.All in all, it's a very concise, informative, insightful read which strangely mirrors many of today's current events. I highly recommend this.

In this book, Barbara Ehrenreich decides to perform an experiment where she will cast off her diplomas and journalistic experience and get a job as a low skill worker in a series of places. She actually chooses to be a Waitress, a House-Cleaner, and then a Wal-Mart employee. She will only live off what she earns, and will not tell anyone about her book until the very end.While noble and somewhat insightful, she tries desperately to insight pity and utterly fails. She tries the typical black and white approach of showing the corporate or owner class exploiting the workers. She provides plenty of examples of her poor treatment, but doesn't provide much insight.Her criticisms are one-sided. She rarely blames her coworkers, or even herself. She complains that the drug tests are unfair and that it prevented her from landing a job. Well, gee, maybe she shouldn't have taken drugs? She feels sorry for a fellow waitress at a local restaurant, but doesn't really mention that it's her fault for not going to another restaurant that could treat her better. She talks with a co-worker who quit college because of a lack of funds. She doesn't mention that whether or not he even tried for financial aid, which, believe me, is definitely available for low-income independent students.One of the worst flaws of the book is that she only experiences the first few months of a job, and doesn't really research the long-term ramifications. I know for a fact that many low skilled jobs offer large pay raises, medical insurance, and even 401(K)s after a few years of work. She conveniently ignores that. She even ignores all pretense of a book and starts trying to unionize Wal-Mart employees.This book is not all bad. When you're finally accustomed to the whining, it actually provides a lot of information. It's cleanly written and flows smoothly. I do admire the fact that this book was made, I admire the effort, and I think it's a book that should have been written.Of course, in an ironic twist, since this book is in trade paperback form, it's largely unaffordable to the people she worked with in the book.

Phil Jackson decided to go against convention and publish his journal despite the fact that it betrays his players and the Lakers. Sounds juicy, right? Well, not really. This is not a book about the players, not about basketball strategy, it's just a journal. Pretty much it. Even though the motivation for writing this book is deceitful and slimy, it's probably it's main selling point.It's worth noting that press gives the impression that it's all about Kobe and Shaq. That is far from the truth. It's about Phil Jackson in his last season with the Lakers. He talks about the team, the management, the games, the travel, etc. Kobe and Shaq are in there, but they don't dominate like it appears they would.I was disappointed in it for a couple of reasons. First off, the book is journal, so it's day by day account with a few anecdotal stories. Topics are just glanced over on random pages. There is no hard hitting facts about one person, nor deep seated basketball strategy. No real depth at all. On one page, he'll describe a conversation with Kobe, then talk about traveling to a different city, then in the next page he'll talk about his girlfriend. Also, he really doesn't say anything new. He explains that Shaq and Kobe have animosity towards one another. No, really? Shaq has free throw problems. Shocking! Gary Payton had trouble adjusting to the Triangle Offense. I would have never guessed! Lakers aren't really motivated in the regular season. You're kidding? A chapter devoted to each of his topics would have brought structure, depth, and a lot more substance. Phil just grazes some of the most important topics (though he does do a fine job explaining his relationship with Bryant).The good part is that the book is quick and fluid. It's also interesting to hear Phil Jackson confirm most of the rumors about the Lakers. He does go into relationships with his players, particularly Kobe, along with management, and his coaches. His views on referees and his perspective on management are interesting and deserve to be highlighted as well. Some interesting stuff that was quite educational, especially near the end.All in all, even though interesting, Phil Jackson doesn't produce anything close to the hype surrounding this book. Wait till paperback or borrow it from a friend.

I reluctantly decided to pick up this book. I thought it would be an extreme left wing rant about the current state of society. In some respects, I was right. At first, I thought, oh no. The author decided to show a bleak view of society by the amount of fast food restaurants there are. He painted a picture of some ideal restaurants being overtaken by huge fast corporations. Uhm, I lived in a place where many fast food places were pretty much banned, and let me tell you, the food was inconsistent, the service rude, the places unclean, and the menu extremely overpriced. So, I initially thought this book was going to fall apart.Then the author started to shift away from his sociological gripes and starts detailing the history and workings of fast food. Intriguing, and fact filled, this section seemed to make up for the his leftist tint. He chronicled the life of a farmer, a land owner, the major food corporations. He provided an interesting view of the integration and exploitation between their workings and interactions. His countless examples of money influencing the politicians also adds to the book.He then moves onto the working conditions of employees at meat packing facilities. Though relying mostly on just a few examples, he convincingly paints the meat industry as corporate monsters who would sacrifice illegal aliens, towns, and the health of even school children to make an extra buck.Finally, in the afterward, he goes into mad cow disease, with a scary and scathing view of the food industry view on this that will make anyone second guess what they put into there mouth.Unfortunately, he never convinced me that fast food places like McDonalds were bad. In fact, he sort of compliments Jack in the Box when it comes to food safety. However, his picture of where meat come from is eye opening and slightly horrifying, and is the real strength of this book.

Crighton does a wonderful job transporting the reader to the 1800s London. The descriptions and the detail are flat out amazing. At some points, it seemed like Crighton himself lived in London during that time. Though immersed in tremendous detail, it so skillfully done that it does not bog down the reader. From the making of safes, to burial procedures, to the slums, and to escaping the most unpenetrable prison, the reader is bombarded with mesmerizing detail. In my opinion, this is the most captivating book ever written.The detail alone would be worth twice the price of the book. The language, though initially confusing with bits of 1800 English, adds to the effect. Crighton yet again uses one of his main strengths - fluidity, to heighten this reading experience.Finally, the plot itself is downright brilliant. A high class, educated man performs the most brilliant preparations for a mighty bank robbery. This book chronicles what the man does. The chapters where he plans out the taking of the keys is some of the most inventive writing ever.This book has great language, superb detail, and an exciting, captivating, intriguing plot. I would recommend this to book to anyone and everyone.

Great book. No need to go into real details here, as mostly everybody has sung the praises of this book time and time again. Though it involves an alien war and space battles, this should not be classified as just a Sci-Fi novel. This book basically goes through Ender's very unique upbringing and schooling, and how it fits with the future of mankind. This should be read by everyone, not just hard core science fiction readers.I enjoyed every aspect of this book, from the intriguing side story of Ender's brother and sister, the struggle of Ender trying to survive in cruel conditions for a child, to the alien civilization that threatens humanity's existence. I hate to sound cliched, but this book works on so many levels.

Asimov, one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time, shows a world of the future filled with political and technological conflicts between earthlings and the Spacers - people from outside planets.This book works in two ways. It gives an excellent picture of the future, while also presenting a great murder mystery. From pedestrian highways, planet colonies, robot-human conflict, to over-population, the future is presented in a way that relates to modern society and modern problems. This gives the reader a greater understanding of the setting compared to most other books.The mystery itself is also very intriguing. Who killed the Spacer? Would the human looking robot be accepted by his partner? What were the political ramifications of this murder? All these problems become apparent throughout this book, and makes the book even more interesting as you read along.I highly recommend this book, as it is one Asimov's finest.

Telling it like it is, Al Franken provides us with wonderful insights into his political wit and all out rants of Rush Limbaugh's weight and political sayings.Al does it all here. From true stories, to visuals, to fake Vietnam chronicles, to jokes, to an imaginary death of his research assistant, he presents his views in a hilarious and gripping manner.It's sometimes smart, sometimes random, rarely vicious, but always funny. Also, it's a great, quick read. The language is fluid and the writing style is conversational. It's like stand-up comedy mixed with CNN Crossfire.... , I still recommend this.

This book starts out well enough, though the reader must trudge through the obligatory small peaceful town setup. As a writer settles back to his hometown to write a novel, a mysterious antique store opens up with some odd owners. From then on, the vampire situation appears.A small town infested with the living undead is a great premise, but the story just doesn't live up. Instead of a terrifying takeover and escape story, the book appears almost comical. Basically, in a period of a few days, a few men try to rescue the town, but do a downright miserable job. The ending is very disappointing, the characters are not enduring, the language sentence structure is too terse, it's too many pages, and the plot, to put in the vernacular - just sucks.This book is more reminiscent to a bad B-movie. It tries to scare, but the only frightening part was that fact that other people find it scary.

If you are a Simpsons fan, you'll love this game. If you're not, well, you find it to be a decent game at best. This game is a smaller, less refined version of GTA littered with great Simpson references. Any true fan of the Simpsons will enjoy finding jokes from many of the shows scattered throughout the game.The Simpsons is like Grand Theft Auto 3 in that missions involve driving a car around a city, and sometimes walking around. Instead of one huge city, there are 7 levels, comprising of one of three different subsections of Springfield - the neighborhood, the downtown, and the marina district. All the Simpsons haunts and characters are there. The Kwik-E-Mart, the Nuclear Power Plant. It's all there. You play as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge and Apu.Unlike other Simpsons games, this is a polished game. It's fun to explore the places and characters. There are many side missions and gags to do as well. Unlike GTA3 though, the sense of being in a living, breathing city is just not there. The main part of the game are the story missions. There are a total of 49 of those to complete. The missions are all a variant of race someone, gather something, or beat the clock. After a while, the repetitiveness of these missions begin to pine away at the novelty. The multi part missions are terrible in that failing a latter part of the mission causes you to restart the whole mission again. Couple this with the bad traffic AI and sometimes you just want to break the controller.There are some other things that frustrate me. The Multi-player is terrible. All it is a cheap race that looks exactly like an NES game (the 8-bit version). It should not have been included. Also, the beginning levels are way too easy, and the latter levels are way too frustrating.All in all, it's a good game and I recommend it to any true Simpsons fan out there, but don't expect miracles.Pros:HilariousTons of obscure Simpsons referencesAn actual fun and polished Simpsons gameGreat for explorationCons:Missions are repetitiveTraffic and AI are badly designedStuck on some missionsThe "multi" player level is an insult to gaming.Time to Complete (Story missions only): 17 hoursFrustration Level: Medium/HighDifficulty Level: Easy/Medium

Well, the graphics are amazing and the batter pitcher interface is smooth and well thought out. The rest, however, should have been worked on a little more.The greatest strength is by far the pitcher batter match-up. When playing against another player, the game simulates reality very well. The pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game. You can throw a fast ball high and tight, and then fake the batter by going low and inside with a change up.The biggest problem I have is that about half of all at-bats are pop-ups to the infield. The rest are harmless grounders or strikeouts. This game is incredibly difficult to hit with, and makes it lack really any playability.Other problems are that stats are not readily available at the end of a game, the sound is reminiscent of a bad Genesis game, controlling runners is a pain, and there is not much control on defense.This game is like an untested prospect, lots of potential, but not really ready for the big time. Best to wait for World Series 2002, if the Dreamcast can survive that long.

Eddings takes us through more travels as the group meets more interesting characters. Though this book consists of more travelling, the meeting of a religiously fanatic Ulgo and an ultra innocent boy named Errand who carries the orb is fascinating. Eddings has a way of introducing and interesting people, and he does it again.The language is great - the fluidity is still there. The action sequences are great as well. The only problem I have this book is the monotony. The group travels, and after finishing one trail, just starts up another one. It?s safe to assume that no one in the group is going to die, so the many minor side battles and towns they visit just become meaningless. I was thoroughly annoyed by the end of the book.However, I still enjoyed this book, and recommend it. Good continuation, despite the same old formula.

I've heard about Salman Rushdie. Both good and bad. The only way to find out the truth for myself was to read one of his books. Being the naturally lazy man that I am, I grabbed the smallest book of his I could find. Little did I know that this book was a fairy tale, and not something that would rouse Islamic fundamentalists.Anyway, I already purchased it and decided to read it anyway. At first, I saw that Rushdie had a great imagination and could weave a great story.This book is about Hauron, a boy living in a glum city where his dad is a prime storyteller. He travels to a far away city, only discover that a Water Genie has stopped his dad's faucet to the sea of stories. In order to help his father, he travels to the Sea of Stories and engages in a war to save the sea, and his father, while meeting interesting characters and seeing interesting sights.The book starts off well, with Rushdie's almost poetic use of language. The book, however, slowly digresses. Not that Rushdie's work disintegrates, but as the fairy tale progresses, with even more characters, and even more anomalies, it gets pretty dull after a while. The ability to shock or dazzle the reader is weened away until it becomes a chore to finish the book.I would say that this book is good for a change of pace, and at only 200 pages, won't take too long to read, but I could only marginally recommend it.

This book is a good read. Sit down with it for a few days, and afterwards, you should know a great deal about MySQL. It covers everything in a very presentable fashion, and is pretty darn fluid. Something rare in technical books. In fact, this is probably the best book out there for MySQL.Unfortunately, when it comes time for implementation, some parts are really bare. The normalization chapter is pretty short and cryptic, though it provides a good introduction to the subject. When it comes to looking up specifics, the warm fuzzy feeling from reading the book slowly melts away. Trying to look up specifics becomes a real hassle (e.g. creating relations between tables), and it doesn't go into great detail on more complex issues (e.g. installing MySQL).This is a great introductory book. It's a nice read, and the language is good. This is not, however, a good reference manual. Despite that, I would still highly recommend this book.

This book tries to be an all in one. It seems the author wrote a nice little program (called Mirus), and decided to write how he wrote this program, instead of teaching how to write a game.First off, half the book is wasted on learning C++. Now, it's a great for anyone to learn C++. It's not great if the first time you learn C++, when you're in a Microsoft environment, trying to create something complex like a game. In fact, that's just plain idiotic.So, since I already know C++, I skipped half the book and got to the introduction to Windows programming. This chapter provided a little hope. He had a very good writing style, his explanations were clear, and I learned something.Then I went to the meat of the book. One chapter basically explains how to do graphics and rendering and so forth. This is the heart of any game book, and he failed miserably. Instead of giving a top down approach, with small simple example of every aspect of rending and animation, he decides to give you his own program in all its glory. Detail after gory detail. After about 100 pages or pure code, I still could get a rectangle to appear on the screen. It's basically a design document disguised as a learning tool. To add insult to injury, he ends the chapter with a summary that pretty much says, "long chapter, huh?", and that's basically it.The equivalent would be to teach someone new to computer how to use a computer by giving him or her the source code for an operating system.It's apparent that the author has not taught a class or written other books before.About 80 percent of the book is worthless fluff even if everything was explained correctly. It's a shame. It's a huge book (I think 1000 pages or something), and it doesn't even go into 3D programming. About 6 out of the 20 odd chapters contain useful information.Just avoid this book, please.

The most important question concerning this product is, does it work? The answer is yes and no.When I first got it and connected it to my cable modem, the setup disk work perfectly and I was on in minutes. Sweet!Then I tried to set it with my router. I used the Linksys BEFSR41 router, probably the most ubiquitous router in the home market. Due to it's monopoly, I was also using the largest broadband provider - Comcast (Oh I how I hate them). So, in terms of home networking, it's the most standard setup around. Anyway, I setup the router to work, and tested it with my Windows 98 machine. That's right, the router and cable modem worked with 6 year old technology. Yet the setup disk for this brand new network adapter did not recognize the connection. It's a simple DHCP connection that really should not pose any problems, but it does.I searched the web for a little while, but I could not find the right settings. The Sony website is absolutely useless. To get my PS2 online, I'm now forced to move my cable modem to my living room, and I cannot have my computer and PS2 connected at the same time. Sony should have tested it better.

Now, if you're the type that believes Frank Herbert's Dune series is a marvel of epic proportions and any expansion or alteration should be considered blasphemy, then, well, your decision has already been made on whether you hate this book. For those that read it only out of obligation to the original Dune series will also predictably be disappointed. This review is not for you guys.For those that can appreciate these books a separate though interesting and compelling sidetrack without any preconceptions, the prequels are quite entertaining. However, this sequel does suffer from a lack of action, one sided characters, and a total lack of summary of the other previous Dune books.The biggest flaw is that most people don't remember the Dune books, as most people read Chapterhouse years and years ago. I advise everyone to read the summaries of the Dune books on Wikipedia before reading this book. Also, some parts of the story do revolve around what happened in the prequels, so I'd advise that if you haven't read the prequels, you read the summaries from Wikipedia as well.The story pretty much revolves around a space ship travelling with Gholas searching for a mysterious enemy, the merger of the Honored Matres and the Sisterhood, and a Thliexu master working for Face Dancers. That's pretty much it. Like some of the prequels (though not all), the story just gets bogged down with repetition without the plot moving along at all. The ending, though supposedly a surprise, is quite predictable.Again, this is seventh book my Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson that extends the Dune series. A few of those books were slow, but those books usually led up to something really good - so I'm going to read on. I'd advise reading it if you really want to know how Frank Herbert ended his Dune series, without the philosophical mumbo-jumbo that plagued the last few Frank Herbert books, this is a worthy, more "entertaining" end to the Dune series.

This thing is plain wrong. Seriously wrong. Apparently, if you have any muscle mass on you, it doesn't work. I'm five foot seven, one hundred forty pounds. I work out somewhat, and have about maybe 10 to 15 pounds max of extra lean muscle mass compared to someone of a similar build who doesn't lift weights. A good amount muscle, yes, but no one will every confuse me with a body builder or professional athlete. Measured by trainers at the gym with fat calipers, I'm about 12-13% body fat.This machine gives me around 21-22% body fat. This is wrong, by the simple fact that the more accurate fat calipers are almost 50% lower, and by the fact that I can still fit in my size 28 jeans.What's worse is the lack of consistency. In the morning, my body fat will 21.7%, and by night, it will be 21.3%, making it completely useless even for measuring change.This is product is laughable and should be avoided.

If there is one thing Grisham can do, it's to transport the reader to the setting, to make the reader feel what the characters feel, see what the characters see and more. In his latter law books, Grisham tends to ignore this in order to bring some sentimental or over the top cliched plot along. When he avoids this, however, is when his writing really shines.Bleachers has nothing to do with law, but it is about an old faded Quarterback returning for the funeral of a beloved, well respected, yet somewhat unknown small town football coaching celebrity. The coach, who is dead before the book really begins, and the town itself, are the real stars of this novel. People of different generations and different ideals come together to honor a man who epitomized this small town and it's extreme love of football. Throughout the Quarterback's visit, we see varying states of nostalgia, remorse, joy, regret about the town as a whole and many of its characters. We also uncover the details of the coach's history, troubles, low points and high points.Grisham truly does an admiral job portraying a small Texas town in just a few days. He expertly weaves a funeral of one man into an all-encompassing, yet compassionate and believable, story that ranks up there with his best works. Grisham will bring you to small town Texas, and at many points, you won't be able to put it down.

I saw this at a bookstore, read the first chapter, and decided that this book was going to be great. However, to my horror, the first chapter has hardly anything to do with the rest of the book. It's becomes quite apparent that Cantor didn't want to write about the plague, but wanted to write about a few isolated characters during that time. The publishers could not have cared less about some friar or some random land holder from the middle ages, so he disguised this book as a book about something interesting.I'm not sure Cantor had any intention other than to relay some random, useless research into a loose collection. This book lacks readability, cohesion, and fluidity. In this small book, he devotes almost a fifth of it to a one useless young princess who dies. He describes her life, her relatives, her travels and on and on. He goes into every detail about her life, except he forgets that no one cares. This book should be about the plague, not about some random midevil life. He pulls nearly the same stuff with other random people that really don't shed any light about the plague. He intermittingly and hapharzadly throws in some stuff to tie things together.About only a quarter of the book is about the plague, and most of it lacks statistics or scientific merit. The only reason this book is not truly, truly awful is that some of the reading is informative, especially about the origins of the plague and other diseases in the mortality chute in the Nile region, and the possibility of anthrax contributing to the death count.All in all, this book is almost worthless. Just ignore the title and the summary on the cover, as it is a total fabrication.

With all the hype surrounding this book, it would seem like this would be an eye-opening mind bending journey to the wide world of economics. Not quite. It's basic economics applied to situations. Pretty much that's it. The one trick pony. Nothing big. In fact, it was already done with the "Arm-Chair Economist", which wasn't that great either.Well, the authors tend to dwell on certain subjects through an economists lens. Now, if you blindly believe the extreme exaggerations that the media portrays about the "crack epidemic", then yes, this may be an unexpected journey into rationalization. However, if you fell for all the hype, I would recommend the book State of Fear instead.This book provides some interesting trivia, like the name girls' name Madison rising in the ranks. It also provides a nice explanation to the sociological state of affairs in the inner city with his explanation of the crack dealers.However, the few dilemmas that this book presents are not that interesting. Why did the crime rate go down? Is there a correlation to naming your child? Do sumo wrestlers cheat? All these chapters could have been easily explained in a few articles. A book was overkill to say the least.I really can't recommend this book, as it's really average.

books when I was a kid,except for this one. The thought of miniaturizing one's self and going into a body in order to save it seemed lame and contrived. Because of this, I avoided this book for the longest time. Finally, I gave in and gave it a chance. It was worth it.The book has some flaws. The flow of the book is not very fluid. It's somewhat abrupt and I was forced to re-read a few paragraphs, especially in the beginning. Even though the level of detail is great, it sometimes became too much and I was bogged down with a cell structure instead of concentrating on the action.That said, the rest of the book is amazing. Asimov does a great job explaining how miniaturization works, and develops an interesting scenario involving wars, weapons, spies, and scientists in which such a procedure was neccesary under a specific time frame. The characters themselves are not truly developed, but instead are used to focus and contribute to the action. A major plus indeed.Asimov seems to weave a story where the human body turns out to be a major battlefield. A place where blood flow causes havoc and where white blood cells are monsters. He transports the reader into a new dimension where the mundane suddenly becomes catostrophic. With this, and his knowledge of the human body, he make a great action and suspense novel.This is a short read and gets to the point. Asimov wanted to write a great tale involving action and biology, and it is well done.

Roth is not the typical author. He doesn't subscribe to conventional wisdom of beginning, climax, conclusion, etc. He concentrates on characters, issues and dialogue. This book, however, didn't seem to satisfy me. Though this novel is short, he delves into a serious subject of whether artists are responsible for society, themselves, or art itself.Roth describes how Nathan Zuckerman, a promising new author, meets and stays with one of his idols in American literature. The conversation seems to lag, and gets to the point in a roundabout and unreal way. Roth then presents a flashback of how Zuckerman had to sacrifice his family relationship for the sake of publishing one story concerning his family and Jewish heritage. Then things took a turn for the worse, when Roth incorporates a wild personal narrative of Anne Frank surviving the holocaust, while refusing to reveal herself.It is intriguing look into responsibility of an artist, but it's way of presenting the issues is almost laughable. While I admire Roth and especially the Human Stain, I can't say I found this one up to par.

This book is an easily readable and interesting look into the life of a financial engineer. Derman describes his life in relation to the history of modern physics and modern finance. He describes the route he took, from a student who wanted to research physics permanently to an enthusiastic programming newbie.This book is sort of divided into four sections. First his early and student life. Then he ventures into the world of UNIX and computer science. As a computer programmer myself, I especially felt the joy he felt when he created a program to solve a small program that was commercialized and used by many other people. The satisfaction of small victories was quite apparent and mirrored my own life in some ways.He then ventures into the world of finance in the mid 80s - during the boom time of financial engineering. His work from a nave physicist to a financial wizard describes both the history of his career development and the quantitave finance itself. He ventures into new topics of finance, such as implied binomial trees and the such.Sometimes the book does get bogged down into a little too much technical detail. I understood the finance and computer programming part perfectly because I've studied and worked in those fields, but the physics stuff was quite esoteric and I had a hard time following much of it.All in all, it's a fun book. Nothing really spectacular, but to see the history of a new field being described, told by a pioneer, is quite fascinating.

Well, I'll be the first to admit that I could care less about punctuation. If the author ever read this review, she'd probably have multiple heart attacks because of my use of punctuation. In other words, I don't care. So, why did this book entertain me? Well, because, I never knew that punctuation was really that important.Though some of the humor is not that humurous, Truss gives us a unique, eye-opening, and amusing view of someone who is a hardcore punctuation stickler. She fully admits her obsessiveness and presents her point of view in an interesting way. She points out common errors in the present day, in her own life, and in history. For a subject this dry, she more than makes up for it with her fluid writing style.Not only does she explain common problems, she also gives rules and usages for all types of punctation. It is very interesting and informative. However, much of it was simplified, so it can't really be used as reference book.All in all, everyone should read it. No, it didn't change my life, but it does make me pause and consider the proper use of punctuation. It does lift away the fog of mystery that surrounds colons, semi-colons, parantheses, etc. If a book makes you look at reading the written word a little differently, then it's done it's job.

This first book in the Elvis Cole series is a better than average book. It's a quick small read (I read it in a day). Elvis, with his biting sarcasm, and Joe Pike, the mysterious non-nonsense detective are introduced. While not as intriguing or captivating as Crais's latest book, L.A. Requiem, this is not bad at all.Crais's love of conflicting characters starts off with Elvis working with a timid woman looking for her son and husband. The plot is further enhanced with the introduction of her forceful and diametrically opposed friend. The plot sifts through the seedy and strange back lots of Hollywood and develops into an interesting mystery. More than a who done, it's all a why was this done, and what to do next type mystery. It involves a good mixture of action, suspense, and character development, despite the constant descriptions of unrelated items that seem to slow the book downThis book is good little mystery/action book and would be a good bet for a lazy Sunday.

The book cover makes it sound like this book is about the culture and sociological changes. In fact, it's basically a description of the author meeting a few people and talking about a few things, all loosely based on the fact that high culture and low brow have merged into one.What I expected was the convergence of such two different types of cultures to be explained in a thought provoking, interesting manner. A smart sociological conscience book. Instead, I basically got John Seabrook's random and pointless observations. He describes the change not by numbers, graphs, professional opinions, numerous sources, but instead just merely points a few random examples, like his closet, the movement of his office from one building to another, how he met a kid guitarist. Absolutely nothing eye opening, noteworthy, interesting, or concrete.This is the equivalent of me talking about the culture and history of Hawaii by showing slides of my vacation. It really is that useless.

Wow, I've never tried to read a book that was so unreadable. Lowry must have taken great pains to make this book as annoying as possible. There is no fluidity, the action and drama is convoluted, and there is no cohesiveness to the entire story.I'll be honest. I could not finish the book. This is the only review I've written where I did not read the entire novel. I, however, felt that 100 pages were 90 pages too much.This is the type of book that turns off casual readers to classic literature. Only the most fanatical English majors could enjoy reading this book. It's a shame that this particular book is highly regarded, because it takes away from real works of literature that everyone should enjoy.I would only recommend this book to English professors, and only a few of my worst enemies.

I would have thought the only way to make a Math book interesting would be to have it be a pop up book where the Numbers would start attacking you or something. Let's face it, math blows bit time. This makes Aczel's work even more amazing.This relatively small book reads even quicker than its size. I completed it in one day - a weekday, with a full day of work no less. Akzel's turns the proof of a 300-year-old equation into a great work of literature. He goes through the proof in a unique way, by describing the history of each part of the proof chronologically. He give mathematical history lessons stretching from Babylonian times to the present day in a way that any layman can understand.Even if you have no interest in numbers or equations, this book will fascinate you. It helps me understand why professors devote their whole lives to mathematics. Heck, it even got me a little interested in Math as well (of course I snapped out of once the Simpsons came on).I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

This game had a cool feature, bullet time game motion. Basically a slow motion system that allows a pseudo-matrix style game play for a few brief seconds. Apparently, they thought that such a gimmick could sell a game. Unfortunately, thousands of people fell for it. The only real revolutionary aspects of this game are the new heights of tedium that this game induces.This game starts off with a story consisting of a comic page animation (e.g. mostly still, cheaply made) with what apparently was an English major desperately trying to use big words and a raspy voice in order to sound sophisticated, deep, and dark. This fails miserably and the darn thing never stops. Then there is the game. You can only save at the start of sub-levels, which automatically brings it down two notches.The game basically is a sequence where you turn a corner, wait for the slow bad guy, shoot, try to open a door, then try another, enter, wait, shoot, and on and on until you hit a save point. That's it. The first level is fine, but the second level gets you. The controls are clunky and shooting is jerky and unresponsive. Bullet damage is seemingly random. Sometimes, you shoot a guy point blank with a shotgun, and he's barely touched. You shoot a guy fifty feet away with a handgun, and he might go down for no reason.The first level is almost fun, since you might die to the randomness, but you'll have to repeat the killing of one or two guys again. The second level, you sometimes have to face up to 15 guys. It's no fun when the 15th guy, at 100 feet away and out of sight, shoots you in with a handgun and destroys all your health. And it takes forever to return the same place beforehand. The producers apparently couldn't differentiate between needless waiting and stealth. By the middle of the game, I was so frustrated by the repeating, waiting, random deaths; I just turned it off and sold the game immediately. I have never gone that far in a game and not finished it. Just totally frustrating.The best way to describe this game is like the non-car missions of Grand Theft Auto, without the fun. I know why this is called Max Payne now. It hurts.

I played a previous Tomb Raiders for about 5 minutes only to realize that the game really wasn't that good. Well, they corrected the problem by pretty much copying the control scheme and puzzle environments of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, one of the best games in this current console generation.The game is short but sweet. Rarely any frustration, rarely any repeating. Now hardcore gamers would be repulsed by that fact they you never have to repeat the same level over and over again or that you won't be struggle over and over again. However, for just fun, simple gameplay, it's pretty good.You play in a few varied levels, an underground cave, in snow, in the jungle, ancient temple. All unique and a sight to behold. The levels have a tremendous amount of checkpoints, so there's no worries about killing the same people or making the same jump over and over again.The gameplay consists of a mixture of action, adventure, and puzzle. In the puzzles, you'll have to move a certain rock of climb a certain rock to advance to the next stage. While not difficult, it will sometimes tingle the synaptic nerves now and again. The action is a simple third person shooter, with a few jumps and quite a few enemies. The weapons are standard, the shooting and auto-aim work pretty much like the standard fair. All in all, it's a standard game done very well.It's not all perfect though. While this game flows well, there are a few moments where the games don't work well. Most notably, the bosses. The game falls into the trap where there has to be a giant creature where you have to find the "trick" to beat it, and then continuously repeat the "trick" or you'll have to repeat the whole ordeal again. Quite boring and annoying to say the least. Also, the motorcycle missions are extremely out of place as well.All in all, it's a very good game. Everyone should at least rent this one.Pros:IntuitiveVaried, colored levelsRarely has to repeat anything.PuzzlesCons:Motorcycle missions were annoyingBosses were boring, clich&eacute;d, and ruined the flowDifficulty Level (on easy): EasyTime to Complete: 8 hours

Rap Metal and Nu Metal were doing great, then all of a sudden, over exposure, changing discretionary spending habits, and just bad albums killed it. This CD, I believe was the last gasp. A few years ago, MTV, Clear Channel, Westwood 1, didn't deem such music worthy enough to hock eighty dollar designer jeans and facial cleansers anymore, so it had to survive on it's own, relying on quality alone. Boy, did it fail miserably in that department.Limp Bizkit was the prime example. Extremely over-exposed, with Fred Durst annoying everyone with his antics. He should have realized it when Mad TV started mocking his videos. Instead of working on the greatest album of his career, he made the most generic album ever made. Every song sounds just like a filler song from their previous albums. It felt like every song took 15 minutes to write. Every song lacks originality, creativity, and quality. I mean, I tried to listen to this album, I really tried, but I just couldn't. I can probably stand two songs, but that's about it. Some songs he sounds like he's trying to be soft and melodically, ala Linkin Park, but it just fails miserably. He makes a terrible song with Snoop "Buy Nokia Phones and Sign up for AOL" Dogg that really lacks any effort whatsoever. Going through the motions does not make an album.I thought maybe my tastes had changed, but then I popped in the Chocolate Starfish album afterwards, and realized that they WERE, actually, really good.This was by far the most disappointing album since Disturbed's second album. It's like Disturbed, Korn, Metallica, and Limp Bizkit got together and decided to make their worst albums at around the same time. It literally hurts thing about it. So, the American public will be forced to listed to the horrible "punk for 13 year old girls" genre (Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, The Ataris, All American Rejects) until aggressive rock comes back.

This book is based on a great concept. Throughout recent history, there have been notorious dictators who, though years ago, dominated our headlines while now are merely footnotes in history books. Riccardo Orizio decides to find seven of these dictators ,interview them, find out what they have been up to, and what they feel about there reign.Each dictator takes a chapter, and the readers learns about their past, their feelings, and their own view of themselves, which proves extremely fascinating. In each chapter, Riccardo details his ordeals on reaching these fallen dictators, a short history of what they did, and what they are currently up to. Riccardo does a great job of simultaneously making fun of and humanizing these individuals. He also provides insight into there current lives, from Idi Amin's sons, one of whom played basketball in Boston College, the other being a military terrorist being help by Idi himself, to Slobadon Milosevic's wife, who plays the role of a tortured, loyal wife.I think the main problem of this book is that it is too addictive. It's a short book, so while I intended to have this book last me a week, I couldn't put in down. I bought at noon, and I finished before dinner. One complaint might be that the interviews and background information are not thorough. While true, I think that by leaving out the text book information, he was able to immerse the reader with the dictator's lives and provide great fluidity.All in all, it's a great idea that proves too addictive to put down.

In terms of Crais's Elvis Cole novels, this is about as middle of the road as it gets. While not a superb novel, there is really nothing wrong with it. Sometimes drags a bit, sometimes exciting, it's a good book nonetheless.Basically, a young girl enters Elvis's office and asks him to find her father. What happens is a typical hairy situation with a lot of twists and turns. Though it is quite unrealistic at the end, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to continue reading about Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike.

It's hard to believe that two of my favorite books, Sphere and The Great Train Robbery were written by the same person who wrote this book. However, through the years, he has gotten too clich&eacute;d and boring to even bother with.Now this book is his absolute worst. Now, this is not a novel, but more of a rant. Now, Michael Crichton pretty much decided that everyone is sheep who has follows global warming alarmists blindingly, so he wrote this book to deride these people. Now, there is no subtlety. If you like to think, then this is not your book. This is like if Ayn Rand wrote about environmentalism. Now I have no concrete beliefs about global warming, because, well, I haven't devoted my life to climatology. This book is mainly an attack on people on alarmists with unbelievably strict opinions with no information. If you don't fit in that category, then this book is not for you.In essence, out of 600 pages, 300 pages is a rant against scientist and Hollywood stereotypes. 200 pages are useless setup, and 100 pages are clich&eacute;d and pointless action. The plot is laughably bad. The characters are unbelievably one sided. The MIT professor who can fight natives and works for clandestine government agencies is as stupid as it sounds.Just don't read this book. This book as novel is terrible, this book as a scientific argument is poorly written (though interesting if you absolutely care).

I guess this book was recently re-released, because for the longest time, it was the only Elvis Cole novel that I couldn't find in any book store. Well, now that it's out, it a pretty standard Elvis Cole novel. And that's fine by me.Without giving too much away, a rich and famous man is accused of murdering his wife. He's hired by the defense to look for dirt on the women who arrived at the crime scene, and investigate other materials. Elvis has his doubts on some of his leads, and he uses his investigative clues and his partner, Joe Pike, to figure it all out.Though it gets somewhat outlandish in the end, this book provides a good mixture of intrigue, detective work, back-stabbing and more. As usual, it's a fun fluid read, and I recommend it.

David Eddings must have had the urge for a new car, because he decided to write an uninspired 5-book sequel to the Belgarion. This first book shows promise, as it reveals what has happened a few years down the line since the end of Belgarion series. It was interesting to see how the character's grew and what each one has accomplished.One of my major complaints about the Belgarion series was that plot was only worth 2 to 3 books, and was stretched to 5 books. This series is only worth about half a book, but it's stretched out to 5 agonizingly long and boring books.This book is probably the best of the bunch, not because it's really better, but because you haven't got sick of the series yet.In this book, Garion is a King, but his son is kidnapped by a some mysterious person leading them to another prophecy that slowly becomes unraveled. He meets up and starts a journey with many of the same characters in order to find his son and figure out the prophecy.As usual, Eddings has a good writing style. Unfortunately, the dialogue is predictable and stale, and no real new characters are introduced.

Okay, this is not a book you'd take to the beach. If you think it is, you're just strange. Anyways, someone gave this book to me because he didn't need it anymore, and learned that I setting up a server for stress testing. Not being an expert in capacity planning, this provided a good introduction to what some of the expectations were to setting up a server environment.This book is not too readable; it lacks fluidity, and is sometimes repetitive. Of course, what would anyone expect from this type of book? One gripe I have with this book is that it's a little too skewed towards to overall management, as opposed to more technical aspects. For example, it concentrates on how to file a problem ticket more than monitoring network statistics.This book gives a good idea on how the process works to set up a plan and how to monitor parts of the system. It doesn't delve to deep into commands, specific examples, and goes in too deep for some parts (like disk capacity), but not too deep into other parts (like memory).It's worth reading, it's a good overview, and it's a template for the few who need to set-up the system. It won't help as technical reference, or help you once you're in front of the computer however.

Grisham mixes up his usual law with a bit of prison and politics to create a neat little intertwined novel. Definitely not one of his best, but it is entertaining nonetheless.The book starts with a series of three prisoners as judges jail house courtroom. It's later discovered that these three judges are part of an elaborate scheme to swindle millions from unsuspecting victims. While in DC, the CIA head is concocting a scheme to hand the presidency to a relatively unknown house member. What ensues is a neat dichotomy of small time crime and big time government caught up in each other's corruption.This book is entertaining, especially the details of the election process. Grisham incorporates his impressive story telling ability to further improve it. It does have its flaws though. Mainly, none of the characters really evoke any sympathy, so it's hard to stay attached to the story. Also, unlike many of his other books, the story doesn't transport the reader to the setting. It's more like the story occurs passively.I would recommend this book, especially to Grisham fans, even though it's basically an average Grisham book.

I'm going to say it outright; I waffled between NFL 2K3 and Madden 2003. It came down to this. NFL 2K and NFL 2K1 were great on the Dreamcast. The last Madden I played was NFL 2002 on the PC. Absolutely terrible. Even though EA is the greatest gaming company in the world, I just couldn't buy Madden for the PS2.So, anyway, I pop the game in, and despite the extra long loading time, and the annoying front end, the graphics are tremendous. By far the best for any football console game. The players look lifelike, and during a walk back scene after a play, a friend of mine who doesn't play video games thought that it was a real televised football game for a second.Of course, graphics mean so little when it comes to playability. NFL 2K and NFL 2K1 had great playability, in this game I found it lacking. There are two big things that irk me, and destroyed a great game: too much randomness and too many little flaws.You might be wondering what I mean when I say randomness. What I mean is that it's hard to gauge how well you're doing when the AI is just wacky. For example, about every fifth game, the running back cannot be stopped. I shift the defensive lineman, crowd the line on 4-3 defense, take a man off coverage to plug up a whole, have three guys wrap their hands around the half back within two yards of the line of scrimmage, yet somehow the HB busts through for ten yards. This happens, constantly. When this does happen, the game is hopeless, and I either have to accept the loss, or reset the game. What about the other 4 games? I play dime defense, and I easily stop the run.How about the flaws? One flaw is offensive rushing. It basically comes down to one question. Do you want to establish the run, or do you want to try to win? Another flaw is the problem of switching to a man in coverage. Often times, when switching to a player, it seems like it switches to a player that is in no position to cover, while I'll swear there is guy who was closer, had the correct momentum, and could have easily hit the receiver. This happens about one-third the time. Guess what? There are four downs. I was screwed. Couple that with the fact that if I nudge (not tackle, but graze him) a player while he's out in pattern, it's automatically pass interference. Also, sacks are just rare. Interceptions outnumber sacks 4 to 1.The most annoying flaw? Couple this with the player switching and PI bug mentioned above, and it's this: when the computer feels like passing, it will win. The best way to stop a drive? Give it a 2nd and short. It will try to rush the next two downs, and that's the best way to stop it. Not quite a grand simulation.Other things annoyed me. The long, long, learning curve for one. Another is the extensive amount of plays. Both of these take some getting use to, so it's not too bad. Field goals are a little tough, especially when you're struggling for 30 yarders while the computer is kicking 50 yarders anytime it wants.So, how did I do in a season? I played franchise mode, which was neat. Being able to sign a player (I got Chris Carter) is cool, but I'm not a fan of the little micromanaging that needs to be done, like negotiating contracts, or signing backups.Anyway, I was the Packers, pro level, and I finished 6-10. I was first in passing offense, and first in overall defense. I was dead last in rushing. I had one sack, and I was sacked 10 times (about 9 of those times were due to the fact that I had an empty backfield). Farve through two times as many interceptions as touchdowns.Here's irony for you. I started off 3 and 3, then I started to learn the game and got a whole lot better, so I started losing. Huh? Well, let me explain. I started to learn how to spot open receivers, figured out how which plays work, actually got a little rushing going, learned to totally stop the run, learned how to play defense pretty well, and usually got off to a lead. This meant that the computer would start passing at almost every down. They'd exploit the bugs mentioned early, drive down, and score, and keep doing this. They're two minute offense is unstoppable. Out of the last 10 games, I lost 7. Four of those losses were due to this and I lost them on the last drive of the game. Onegames I lost was due to unstoppable running back. I maybe lost two legitimate games out of the seven. Not fun at all.Other things annoyed me. The camera angles are not very well done. Even the far camera angle cuts off the sides of the field. Also, you cannot design your own plays. What's up with that?Lastly, they have the most annoying thing in sports game. Level adjustment bars. How bad is that? I don't go to a golf course and choose to tee off where ever I want. I don't widen the hole to make putting easier. I don't pick up the ball and throw it twenty feet farther just because the course is hard. I play the course as is. If the course is screwed up, I just don't play it. It's the same way with sports games. Also, adjusting tackling or speed changes the game completely, and when you have to revert back when playing another opponent, it will mess me up completely.Okay that was the bad. Here's the good. It's still a good simulation up to a point. The feel of passing is unbelievable. It's not like other games, you actually have to survey the field (unfortunately, the camera angles don't allow you to do it perfectly). Granted, there are way too many interceptions, it's still the best feel, as opposed to previous games where you knew Steve Young to Jerry Rice would always work.Two player is pretty fun, since there's no computer cheating to screw you up. Finally, it's a smooth game. You rarely see the phantom catches or tackle, and players don't go through other players. It's safe to say it's a very polished, crisp, well made game. You can see that a lot of time and effort was put into this game.Would I recommend it? Probably if you'll play a lot of two player (I have not tried the online version, though I heard there a lot of cheaters who pause right before they are about to lose). If you want a good game where you can just sink you're teeth into it, just go out and buy a used Dreamcast with NFL 2K. It'll probably be cheaper.

I'll be straight about it. I think the Xbox is a joke. It has only survived this long because of Microsoft's deep pockets and commitment to monopolistic behavior. It's pretty certain that if the Xbox ever dominates the gaming industry, all the progress we've seen from gaming would come to a grinding halt. For example, what's the difference between Windows 95 and Me, IE 2.0 and IE 6.0, Office 95 and 2000? You see my point.Now that I've got my technological, economic, and philosophical rant out of the way, on to the book. The bad part of this book is that at some points, it's almost an advertisement for the Xbox. The other parts, however, are great. Takahashi gives unprecedented access to the creation of the Xbox. Not just technically, but in terms of finances, company wide politics, relationships with vendors, and a look into the people who developed it.Granted, this in not much a video console book as much as it is a business incubation study. That's what is really pleasing about it. It just happened to be that a video game console is one of the more interesting products to develop.This is well written, the language is fluid, and it's all encompassing. It goes from how one man made a terrible game, then combined with a few other friends to make a console. It goes through its battle within Microsoft, from finding a good economic model, to fighting off the WebTV department. It then delves into supplier issues, game development issues. It ends up with the marketing and development of the game console itself. All the while probing the lives and histories of people involved.The only other problem besides the pro Xbox feel was that chronologically, Takahashi tends to skip around a bit, resulting in confusion as certain points.Other than that, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.

Okay, sorry for the pun. Anyway, this book is classic Grisham. A pretty good courtroom page turner with a lot of twists and turns. This book is not one of his best, however. He gets pretty in depth with courtroom proceedings, and the amount of usual Grisham type intrigue doesn?t come through. It's basically one trial and shouldn't have taken that many pages.Basically, a high court tobacco trial commences. This trial, a sort of Goliath versus Goliath matchup, hinges on the jury. One jury member, however, wants to use this power. Through his mysterious girlfriend and wit, he continually bribes and cajoles jury consultants on both sides.Unfortunately, I just gave away half the plot right there. Grisham takes over two hundred pages to explain that. However, this is John Grisham, so the pages do tend to turn quickly.If you're looking for a good Grisham book, I'd suggest The Rainmaker or A Painted House.

Years ago, GTA was released as possibly the greatest console game of all time. This game revisits the same city as in GTA 3, so it's best to consider it an expansion pack. A little late in the game, but still great. Now I haven't touched GTA 3 in about 4 years, but I still remember the streets, the layouts, the tunnels and so forth.I personally found the last two games in the series extremely flawed. Vice City was plagued by bad AI, claustrophobic streets, slow cars, and closed end missions. San Andreas was extremely gimmicky, extremely unbalanced, and overall too large and unwieldy. It's good to return back to the best GTA of the series.This is the easiest of all 4 PS2 GTA games. It's also the most balanced one of them all. The missions are smaller, with an increased reliance on driving and open endedness. For example, there's a mission where you need to chase two vans after destroying a warehouse. You could ride a motorcycle to and shoot the vans, try to ram them with a large car, or after some thought, destroy the vans before destroying the warehouse.This game lacks some of the useless bells and whistles of the previous games. You won't get the flavor of the week actor voicing a clich&eacute;d grade B movie clip, nor will you get washed up 80s one hit wonders on your radio. That's not a problem for me.This game is all about gameplay. Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking. Just fun. Plain and simple. A refreshing change for Rockstar, and at quite a bargain price.Pros:No Gimmicks (e.g. eating, planes)Open ended missionsRevisits the same city from GTA 3Cons:Still need to repeat the earlier parts of missions.Difficulty Level: MediumTime to Complete (story missions only): 20 hoursFrustration Level: Medium

To anyone who is disgusted with local news, can't watch CNN, and would rather read the Economist instead of US News, Time, and Newsweek, this might be the perfect book. The name is sort of a misnomer though. It should be called "Media of Fear". Nonetheless, it reinforces what I've felt all along, that the media and news are not out to report what's informative and worthy, but what is sexy - and that is fear. Even though this was written before 9/11, this is even more poignant now.Glassner explains how the media ignores statistics and common sense in order to fill the airwaves and the printed word with scare tactics. He explains how the media, influenced by political groups and human interest stories, ignore the big picture and focus on anecdotal evidence in order to sell their fear. He provides many examples of this, from airplane crashes to vaccines, and explains how these unfounded fears come about. He carefully uses both concrete evidence and statistics to prove the media wrong, and explains why and how the media choose to report the way they do.Unfortunately, for people like me who already agree with him, it doesn't provide much new information. Also, when he talks of the media, he talks of the supply side. He rarely mentions the demand side. Why is such media is actually being watched, and why are consumers falling for this, hook, line, and sinker?Finally, the writing style is not altogether fluid. It's hard to describe, but it's not a real page turner.All in all, it's a good book. It'll either confirm what you already know, or be an eye opener.

I was extremely disappointed in this book. Grisham, who is one of my favorite authors, spews out this terrible book for no reason. In a contrived, boring, unbelievable story, Grisham goes through the motions in this long, drowned out novel.A young boy, from a poor trailer family, tries to intervene in a suicide, only to be caught in a web of secrets concerning the missing body of a Senator. With the mob, FBI, and an old boring lawyer, the very young boy, who Grisham portrays as the smartest, most cunning person ever for some odd reason, has to endure a lot of annoying stuff in order to get to an ending that everyone, but Grisham, knew was going to happen.A poor boy finds out a secret that puts his life in danger from the mob. Sounds like the perfect solution would be the witness protection program? Guess what, that is the ending. Of course, for some reason Grisham goes about in the most roundabout, superfluous way. There was no story here.This book is pointless, boring, repetitive, and the young kid, who Grisham accidentally blessed with a superhuman intelligence and an amazing ability to annoy, absolutely kills it.I have no idea what Grisham was thinking when he was writing this book. I could not recommend this at all.

Fraser does an excellent job of detailing many high stressed white collar jobs that continually demand more and more work. She explains the cost, and details it with smidgen of statistics and a lot of one-person stories. Though one sided, it does do an excellent job of telling her point of view.She details the effects fanatic pace of the average white collar worker, the invasion of the professional life into the private life, the effects of layoffs, the slow erosion of benefits, and the complete absence of job security. She incorporates great stories about companies, certain people, CEOs, and certain ideas.This book is a fluid page-turner and puts most other non-fiction books to shame. It's an easy read that captures and fascinates you.The main flaw in the book is "evil corporation" and victimization idea, and how CEOs are just in for stock market increases. She doesn't blame the stockholders, which are often pensions and mutual funds, for supporting such short-sided CEOs. She gives the impressions that layoffs are all bad, and that they should be avoided totally, despite the health of the company and economy. Most importantly, she places no guilt on the employees who continue to endure the continuously demanding pressures of their job. Instead of quitting, they abide by their job in order to pay for their current lifestyle, despite the increasing workload and disappearing benefits. It's not the corporation's fault that there is a huge mortgage or car payments, it's purely on the employees end there.

I've never really like first person shooters. This game, my first real first person shooter I ever bought and completed, was really enjoyable. For a "Greatest Hits" game, it provides good value and good fun. I appreciated it as a learning tool (yes I did it on easy), and as a game itself.There were some problems with this game though. It tried to emulate an adventure and stealth game within a first person shooter. This was done very poorly and destroyed much of the continuity. This sometimes meant annoying backtracking, and pointless exploration. Other times, it meant that if you can't continue unless you got a certain vehicle, or hit a certain button. The stealth aspect is the worse. I felt it was clumsy and completely arbitrary when a guard saw you or not. Luckily, I downloaded a walkthrough, which reduced much of this drudgery. Also, the vehicles are clunky, boring, and take away from the flow as well.Now to the good part. While not a huge graphical achievement, it was still very smooth, and there was no clipping, slowdown, or bad camera angles. Not stunning, but still, very polished nonetheless. The controls were a bit tough to get use to, but if you haven't engrained yourself to the PC controls, the transition is not bad at all. The auto aiming provides a bit of ease to it.The best way to describe the feel is to think of the movie Total Recall without Arnold or the freaks. You're a revolutionary in the Mars mines, fighting your way through. You travel through mines, caves, high tech buildings, hospitals, space station, and through water. The scenery is sometimes chilling, sometimes peaceful, sometimes ruddy. It all works well with the mood of the game. The computer AI is decent (e.g. the don't run right into ambushes or get trapped in corners or behind walls), and the weapons offer a bit of variety.There are no real levels in this game, but about 70 load points to go through. This provides a huge area to pass. Saving can be done at any place, which is a huge, huge, plus. There are only two bosses, so it's good to know it doesn't rely on the old tired gaming clich&eacute;.Finally, it has difficulty levels. I'm new to first person shooters, so I choose easy. Maybe it was a bit hard at some points, while it was a way too easy at most other points, but it's better than being frustrated beyond belief. If you're masochistic or an expert, you can move up to a more difficult position. Either way, everyone will be satisfied.This game also has the standard multiplayer mode. You can compete against another player, or against computer players. The levels are fun, and it's good to get way to practice or get some aggression out.In short it's a very good game for everyone. If you want a fun small adventure, choose easy and download a walkthrough. If you want a challenge, choose the impossible level, and try to figure out those little puzzle and stealths.Pros:Controls are not bad.Smooth and polished.Great Value.Large and varied environments.Cons:Pointless searching.Vehicles clunky and forced upon.Stealth base action clumsy, annoying.Difficulty not spread evenly.Time to complete: 15 hours (walkthrough and easy level).Difficulty level: Varies from really easy to really hard.Frustration level: Medium

I would highly advice that if you choose to get Satellite Radio, you should get it professional installed. I'm experimenting, so I went with the cheaper option. It works pretty well.You should note that you'll have a few wires sticking out everywhere, and it will look kind of cheap, but if you can get over that, it works well. It has a cradle, a mounting bracket that can stick to the dash, and a mini FM transmitter so you can listen to Sirius through your radio. The whole system works quite well and does the job as best as it can. It's easy to and simple to setup, so that should not be a problem. The sound quality is a little weak, but it does the job.Besides looking kind of cheap, which is not the docking kits fault, there are two main problems. One is that the mount uses screws or adhesive. I'm not going to drill randomly into my car, so I used the adhesive. The adhesive works very well, but I worry that if I ever remove the mount, will it take chunks of my dash with it? I don't know, which would be really scary if I deeply cared for my car. The second problem is that there is no power supply for a wall socket. This means that if you don't fork over another fifty dollars, you'll have to do the setup in your car, while the car is running. This is truly cheap and annoying.All in all, it works well for those on a budget or those not willing to commit fully to Sirius radio.

This book is an excellent introduction to e-mail programming and protocols. It is as easy to read as any novel, explains everything neatly and concisely, and provides excellent examples.This covers what a mail server does and how it works, but really concentrates on mail client-server interaction. It goes into SMTP, ESMTP, MIME, POP3, IMAP, and vCard format. The examples are clear and concise, and it includes actual code in Perl and Java. This provides the reader with excellent, platform independent ways to do what they need to do.The writing style is excellent. One of the most fluid technical books I've ever read. In fact, all I needed was one Sunday to read the book from front to back.The code provided is superb. It's easy to use, easy to understand, and aides in the learning process. For me, the code is invaluable. It has personally saved me countless hours of work.Finally, this book doesn't delve in tremendous detail. It tells the reader how to program for e-mail, but doesn't go into the RFC's as much as many people would like it to. I think, however, that this is a real strength. Many technical books bog the reader down with irrelevant information. This books avoids this, but still gives the user information on how to retrieve any additional information if needed.Though there are not many e-mail programming books out there, this is by far the best one. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Sirius satellite should be considered a great complement to your audio system, whether in home or car. It should not be considered an end all to music selection. It will not replace CDs, mp3s or typical over the air radio. Once this expectation is established, it's good to see Sirius as a decent addition to those who love music.First off, how much does it cost? You'll need a receiver, then a docking system for the home or office. Then there is a setup fee. So you're looking at a little under $200 to get started. Quite a huge investment for just checking out a new type of radio. I would advise getting Sirius professional installed in your car, unless you don't mind wire flaying around when you drive while looking at a tacking do it yourself setup. Also, if you want both home and office, you'll have to buy a boombox. This can run to about $350 total. Quite pricey, especially when it doesn't include any monthly fees.Secondly, how about the reception? It's surprisingly well in my car, but does suffer some dark spots when you go under a tunnel or when travelling through a tree line street. However, I was unable to get any signal in neither my home nor my office, so don't automatically assume that it will work at your home. The only consolation is that if you sign up for Sirius, you get monthly web access.Thirdly, how about the playlist? The best way to describe Sirius's playlist is probably a lot breadth, but not quite a lot of depth. For music, unless you love every type of music available, you'll actually only have about 10 music stations to listen to. For example, all Classical, Latin, Electronic, Jazz, Children and Love stations are absolutely useless to me as this not my type of music. In terms of sports, it's got the NFL, NBA, and if ever, NHL. The best game for radio, baseball, is with XM satellite, which is a huge bummer. Many of the news stations and entertainment stations are just audio replays of audio stations, so it's got commercials and aren't altogether suited for radio. For example, you'll hear, "take a look at this replay". Well, I can't look, it's radio. All in all, the talk and music is the equivalent of doubling the FM and AM radio stations of a big city. You'll still listen to your normal stations, but the number of stations will be expanded.Fourthly, how about the receiver itself? It's pretty good. The display is huge. You get to see the band or song name before switching to a different station. I love that. It can store 20 songs, which, when one of the songs comes up, the receiver will beep and give you the option of changing to that station. The only small problems were that sometimes the stored songs didn't come up, and the turn wheel will lacks a grip, which is annoying when driving.Fifthly, what were some of the major problems of Satellite radio? Besides the high cost for the equipment, the fact that they charge an activation fee was annoying. I'm willing to pay a monthly fee, do I need to add another fee to that? Secondly, the nickel and diming continues with the fact that the receiver contains no basic antenna nor power supply. You must buy a docking kit no matter what. I bought a car docking kit, but it only had a power supply for the cigarette lighter, which meant that all setup has to be done outdoors, in the car, with the car running. I couldn't even test it to see if it would work indoors, so I had to buy a boombox to test, only to find out it didn't work, and then return the boombox. A cheap home AC/DC power supply included in the docking kit would have saved me hours without costing me fifty dollars for the other docking system. Also, the customer service is not that great. The people on phone are nice, but you have to endure the navigation system along with a large self-serving tirade about how well Sirius radio is before you can get to the menu. In order to get stream player access, you have to e-mail them for the password, but no one bothered to reply to my e-mail, so I had to call them again. When the company won't give you the password for the free web access, and won't reply when you follow the website instructions, it gets annoying. Another thing is the repetitiveness and limiting factors of the playlist. Some of the bands I'm interested in, Carbon Leaf, the Streets, Perfect Circle, Tool - groups that I thought should appear for paid radio, are not really there. However, Ashlee Simpson, Maroon 5 and Leonard Skynard are pretty much on 24/7. Not quite the original playlists I was hoping to get.Finally, what were some of the things that surprised me? First off, it's still cool. To be free of Clear Channel's chokehold on music radio is great. The web access is free. XM charges you about four dollars a month, making it more expensive monthly if you use web access. If you get Dish Network, the music stations are there already to listen through over your television. If you don't get Dish Network, you can get a free preview via the web for three days. Nice. Finally, I've become acquainted with many bands that I would not have known or just barely remember. It's nice to hear Traffic, Public Enemy, Guns and Roses, Flogging Molly, N.W.A., etc.So, all in all, it's a nice complement, but it's no magic musical panacea.Pros:Song preview20 Memory StorageLarge displayFree online access after signing upFree 3-day online previewCons:Nickel and dimingVery repetitive song listEntertainment and News is Just a Replay of TelevisionCustomer Service is lackingSignal cannot be received in many places.Minimum Setup Cost ~ 200 dollarsOptimal Setup Cost ~ 350 dollarsMonthly Cost ~ 13 dollars

Okay, this should not be revolutionary to anyone. Companies should concentrate on demand and customers? Uh, thanks. Try to differentiate your product to get higher returns. Uh, thanks again. Proper resource allocation is essential. No, really?Kash makes some good suggestions on how companies should develop, market, research and produce in order to meet demand, instead of concentrating all efforts into the supply side. These suggestions, which are very sound, are just plain common sense. It's not revolutionary in any terms. He develops six principles on which to do this and devotes chapters to it, ranging from researching to resource allocation. I would provide the list here, but then that would mean Kash's book would be entirely useless.What's more insulting than the "revolutionary" in the title are the complements on the back of the book. Such people as the head of McDonalds, EMC, and Gillete have gave great reviews for this book. Of course, if you read the book, you'll see that Kash has actually praised those executives countless times. If someone wrote a book about me, and praised me - heck, I'd consider it a literary masterpiece.This book just basically is a list of principles wrapped around tons of success stories and a complete lack of humility. Avoid it.

I think the worst thing about this game is that it should have been the best PS2 game ever. Perhaps the best console game ever. Unfortunately, a few flaws here and there take away and just make it above average game at best.The worst flaw, without a doubt, is there is no map and no point of reference. Instead of exploring a living, breathing city, you&#65533;re forced to rely on turn signals from your car. This takes away from the fun as it forces you to drive in a linear fashion. Worst off, you don&#65533;t know if you&#65533;re going north or south, or if you&#65533;re close to your destination or not. Even though it&#65533;s London, I felt that I never really went to London. Grand Theft Auto&#65533;s Liberty City, on the other hand, is still fresh in my mind. All you do is drive through streets with old buildings, hoping to see a landmark like the Tower Bridge or Big Ben. Unfortunately, all you do is drive down an anonymous street and turn into another anonymous street. Why did they spend all that time re-creating London if you can&#65533;t even explore it effectively? Such a waste.I&#65533;ve heard that in Britain, they at least got a map of London. In the U.S., they didn&#65533;t even bother. Granted, maybe they think we Americans are so smart that we don&#65533;t a map, or maybe they jealous of our immaculate teeth and superior highway system. I don&#65533;t know. Anyway, we need a map. The turn signal alternative has got to be the worst decision in gaming history, not only is it linear, it forces you into one way streets, and doesn&#65533;t even work half the time. When you finally do reach a destination, they don&#65533;t tell you where to go, they only give you a general area, and you have to mindlessly walk around until you find the entrance. Not too fun when you&#65533;re being shot at by cops.Finally, the drives are very long. They didn&#65533;t make a huge city, they just purposely set destinations from one side of the city to the other, while the turn signals would purposely lead you into wayward directions. The amount of city space in London is about the equivalent of Liberty City, and a little bigger than Vice City. Only with the monotony of driving does it seem bigger.There are some other problems. Out of the 24 missions, mission 12 is ridiculously cheap and forces you to restart over and over, and mission 7 needs a lot further explanation. For example, you&#65533;re mission is to kill this one cop. Of course, they really meant was that you lead him into a room so you could kill him in a cut scene. I tried for a solid hour trying to kill this guy who I later found out was invincible while outside that room. Thanks Team Soho.There are some great points to this game. The A.I., despite criticisms, is excellent. Traffic flows smoothly, the pedestrians are smart, and you&#65533;re side characters are somewhat intelligent. Nothing terrible like Lance from GTA: Vice City. The controls are slightly clunky, but very intuitive. The cut scenes, even though unskippible (thanks again Team Soho), are marginally entertaining. The graphics are excellent. Much better than GTA 3 or Vice City. The indoor portion (about half the game) is by far better. The controls are actually decent, and the indoor atmosphere (crack houses, slums, warehouses, manors) are fun and doable (except Missions 7 and 12).Finally, the second half of the game (where you play a cop instead of Mark Hammond) is really fun. Being a cop, the police don&#65533;t harass you. You also go to many of the same places as in the first half of the game, so you&#65533;re not a total slave to the turn signals. Also, the missions are fun, but not annoying or frustrating. What this means is that driving is actually not tedious, the missions enjoyable, and the cut scenes provide a nice, entertaining break. All that being said, the second half had a flow that was amazing. I played the second half of the game in one sitting.I still think this is a good game. Unfortunately, after countless years of development, the blatantly stupid navigation system forces it from being the &#65533;Titanic&#65533; of video games, to the &#65533;Waterworld&#65533; of video games.

A rich old man concocts a plan to remove his family from his will in the most curious way. What's left is a hectic aftermath where the family is suing, and the search for the missing sole heir takes a recovering alcoholic to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. A nice location piece, with action, vivid descriptions, and the usual mixture of Grisham law, is a good read.Grisham mixes in his great mix of characters, a great description of the Amazon and a removed Native American Brazilian tribe, and the intricacies of inheritance laws. While the plot moves quickly, there's not much to capture the attention. The reader shares no sympathies with any of the characters, and some characters are too one sided. At some points, the descriptions get a little dull and overwhelming, especially concerning the family and their lawyers.I'd like this book, but somehow it was unsatisfying. It's got the classic Grisham story telling substance, but it's too long for such a simple plot.

A murder occurred against a young college student, and a father wishes for her former fianc&eacute;, Joe Pike, to help solve this murder. The only problem is that the fianc&eacute; is a mysterious person with a secret past, who was labeled as a cop killer. The mystery of this murder grows, while the life of Joe Pike unfolds.This book is a great novel. A light, fun read with the action and plot of a movie. From crime scene investigations, to thrilling prisoner escapes, this book has it all. A real, true page turner.Nothing heavy or fancy, and nothing intellectually challenging, but I recommend this nonetheless.

This book is one of the better Crais mystery's out there. It describes a broken detective named Carol Starkey and how she works on a case to find a national bomber.Without going into details, it's a fun, fast paced book with a smart plot. Crais successfully weaves characters into a single case involving a mysterious and intelligent bomber. The main character, Starkey is a fallible officer who has to battle more than a few problems along with the bomber case, and is shown to be both smart, dumb, rigid, uncaring, and determined. For a typical supermarket thriller, she is surprisingly complex.The only unfortunate thing about this book is that Crais ends it with a predictable and cliched ending that just makes you shake your head.All in all, it's just a good read.

I think when most people think of Michael Lewis, they think of Moneyball - the book that rocked major league baseball. I also think of Liar's Poker, an interesting look into the bond business in the eighties. Heck, I still quote "Equities in Dallas" from time to time. Anyway, when I saw this, I was excited because football is the most strategic of all sports, and this could have shed a lot of light on such a fascinating subject.Unfortunately, that was not the case. It is an interesting book, but the "Evolution" of the game is that left tackles are now considered pretty important. That's the evolution. Sorry I gave it away. There is some history of football, recruiting, the west coast offense, and the development of the offensive line, but it's not that much.Most of the book is a touchy feely story of an offensive tackle who is adopted by a rich white family and through their help, turns his life into an living afternoon television special. While somewhat touching, it got a little too bogged down in the details and turned pretty much into a sappy drama.Yes, it is readable, and fun, but really nothing to recommend.

I have never played a role playing game ever. The closest I came was Zelda on the Super Nintendo. When I think of role-playing games, I think of games designed for losers living in their mother's basement watching Star Trek reruns and playing Dungeons and Dragons. At some points of this game, I felt I was way off, and some points I thought I was right. Everyone said this is one of the greatest games ever created, so I had to at least play it before dismissing it to the realms of geeks and nerds.This game is gorgeous, long, annoying, yet ultimately rewarding. At some points of the game, I wanted to throw this game away, while at other points I wanted to play it non-stop. Throughout this game I wondered why I bothered buying it, and other times I wondered why I hated earlier.The first thing people notice is that in the beginning and throughout many places, this game represents more of an interactive movie than a game. The first two hours consist of like 10 minutes of game play. I initially hated this game. The scenes seemed garish, puzzling, and long, and worst of all, could not be skipped. You have to watch all the movies, no X-button skip here. Then about five hours into it, when the game play showed itself, and my eyes grew accustomed to the garish Japanese anime type movies, I started to slowing get engrossed in it. After a while, I got annoyed when the movies started to become less frequent. The puzzling story and environment slowly becomes unraveled, along with the histories of the characters. What ensues is an engrossing, lavish, spectacular story full of good twists and animations. One of the main pluses is that it takes places on a group of lush tropical islands, instead of the depressing typical dungeons and/or medieval town that I associate with RPGs. The only thing that annoyed me was the somewhat ambiguous ending. I played this game for a long time - I wanted a concrete ending that was worth my time.What makes this game enjoyable is the lush tropical surroundings and imaginative characters. The scenery itself is worth the price of the game. The backgrounds are spectacular and really shows what a game could do. One major gripe I had was the Japanese anime stuff, especially the females. It seems like they were designed by frustrated perverts who flunked out of art school. It's embarrassing having someone walking in while I'm playing this game. They could have dressed the girls in a more conservative costume, and made some of them not speak like junior high school dropouts.The fighting sequences are the meat of the game. Though monotonous at some points, it's still pretty good for what it is. It's turn-based, which seems almost sacrilegious to me, but after I while I really started to appreciate the use of strategy involved. The fact that the fights are really won by good reasoning as opposed to a quick thumb is pretty cool. Though some of the bosses are pretty hard, with help from the internet, I never had to fight a boss more than three times.What was really enjoyable was that it took into account one thing that hardly any other game does - fair progression. If you work hard and fight all the monsters in the beginning, it pays off in the end. Though some bosses seemed impossible, the fact that you progressed steadily, along with the continuos learning of the gameplay nuances, really comes out. Many games start out easy, with the only way to win at the end is to go through some cheap trick, cheat, or pass some impossible jump. This doesn't rely on that annoying formula at. Also, when bosses seem impossible, going to the internet can offer many hints on the bosses weaknesses and strengths, and can aid you, but not win it for you.Unfortunately, this game has many flaws. The most noticeable is you can't save it any point in the game. Since you don't know when you?ll be able to save it, you don't know if you can go to sleep within a few minutes, or within an hour. I really hate that. My schedule is sometimes tight. I don't want to block out a two hours of my time and only play for ten minutes.Another thing is that it's just way too long for a normal game. I've got a job. This is not the type of exciting game that can be played for ten hours straight. If you play for an hour every night, it would take two months to pass this game. I have a job and a life. If I didn't have an injury that kept me indoors, I would have never finished this game.One thing that annoyed me was that you'd have to talk to someone or walk into a room for the game to continue, and many times the game won't say what to do. It's a minor annoyance, but really got on my nerves since I spent time unrelated to the gameplay or movie.The last gripe I have is that the game also tries to incorporate other things into it. Most notably puzzles and blitzball. The puzzles are dull and boring and don't fit into the game. Unfortunately, you have to go through them to continue. Blitzball is terrible. It's some futuristic turn-based made up game that is just plain stupid. A turn-based sport is pretty lame by itself. A made up game is even worse.Did I enjoy this game? Yes, very much so. Would I play it again? Not on your life. Would I get the next game in the series? No way. This game is not a mainstream game, and it shows. Too long and too weird for most people's taste. Unless Final Fantasy 11 is more in tune with the average gamer, Squaresoft will still be bleeding money.Pros:Gorgeous - bright and imaginativeLong story is gripping, actually worth it.Progression is fair - no cheap tricks or cheats requiredExtremely polished, professionalCons:Puzzles are worthlessIt's really too long of a gameNewbies struggle for a little whileBlitzball is the lamest thing on earthThe females should be better representedCan't save at any pointAmbiguous endingNot designed for normal gamersHours to pass: 60-70 hoursDifficulty: Medium to HardAnnoyance Level: High

Joey is going to make a hit. Hit number 29 in fact. This time it's a bit strange. He knows the intended victim from childhood, the guy who hired him has a vendetta against him, he's got people following him, and he's not quite sure if the guy deserves what he's getting.The book boils down to whether in the end, the victim gets killed, or Joey gets shafted. In order to describe how he kills someone, he describes the events leading to, during, and after the job has been done. While hitting is a great story, the preparation involved, along with the needless and pointless details is not.Joey seems to describe his days at the track, his arguments with his wife, how he hates one guy, how numbers are run. Seemingly sidetracked, he sometimes forgets he's hitting a guy and describes the tedious day to day movements of his own life. When he does go back to the hit, the mystery of the victim is fragmented and hardly fluid.While interesting in the beginning, towards the later half it gets pretty monotonous, as if delaying the ending in order to fill a few more pages.What saves it is that is a true story, and does provide insight to the methodical way a hit is accomplished, along with a description of a life of a New York criminal.

Have you seen Goodfellas? One of the greatest movies of all time. Have you seen Casino? Pretty much a remake of Goodfellas, same director, a lot of the same actors, but inferior. Decent movie, but definitely not great. Those two movies describe how I feel about Vice City. While GTA3 was probably the greatest game ever created, this game is merely playable.The good news about Vice City is that it's not Grand Theft Auto 4 - it's best to consider it a sort of expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto 3. This means it pretty much uses the exact same engine as GTA3 that we all know and love. I could go on and on about how great this free roaming city is, but then I'd just be re-reviewing GTA3.What people won't tell you is the bad. Here it is. First off, this game is full of bugs. Some of them minor, some of them full on PC like crashes. Didn't we all buy a console to get away from PC faults? I've worked on games before, and I know for a fact that if Sony's team finds a crash, it automatically gets rejected and has to wait for another cycle. Since the game crashed 4 times for me, I have a feeling Sony let these mishaps slide. It's a shame, because Sony usually hasn't wavered at all. They've actually prevented Sony's own games from being shipped, losing tons of marketing dollars due to mistimed advertising.Secondly, the game is way, way too gimmicky. The amount of time spent on the missions were split between with 20% car based kill em or chase em missions, and the 80% on other types of missions. The mission numbers themselves are not split up that way, but you spend more time and are much more annoyed on the gimmicky missions. The gimmicky missions are the ones that involve a radio controlled helicopter, motorcycles, bi-planes, boats, going into malls, racing, and any mission involving another character named Lance. The rc helicopter motorcycles, planes, and boats are just clumsy, annoying, unresponsive, and not fun at all. Since each new vehicle requires a learning curve, I spent even more time being bored and frustrated with these vehicles. Lance is the worst. He's with you in some missions, but does the stupidest things, likes stands in front of you gun fire, or while you're hiding behind a wall from gunfire, he'll follow you and stop right before the wall, just standing there like a sitting duck waiting to be shot. The races are hard, and since there is no freedom, all it is just a cheap racing game - those are a dime a dozen these days. In fact, the four or five hardest missions were hampered by the cheapness of Lance, the utter horror of using the lame other vehicles, bugs and crashes, and/or the race problems.Thirdly, are that the missions themselves are not apparent. In GTA3, I used a walkthrough for the missions. I vowed not to use it for this game. Unfortunately, I had to use a walkthrough to find the missions themselves! Here's the thing that you are suppose to magically guess. After completing one mission, you can buy properties. Out of the many properties, there are about 8 assets to get. They won't tell you which ones, so you have to buy them all up or guess. So, each asset has missions. Of course some of these assets won't even tell you the mission. One is where you have to sell 50 items, but there is no mention of 50 items. I suppose I was suppose to have guessed that as well. Another is just plain stupid. You buy a strip club, and the "mission" is to go to dance booth and stay there for fifteen minutes. But no one bothers saying that that is a mission. I would have never found that out on my own; I would not have even tried that as a guess, because I'm not desperate enough to look at a polygon stripper for fifteen minutes.So, in order to get to the last missions - you would to have guessed the following: buy 6 assets, including the print works and Malibu club, complete all the missions, including the ones where the mission itself is not presented, and then, you can go to the last missions. Am I freakin' Miss Cleo here? What the heck is up with that? I'm here to play a game, not some King's Quest point, click, look, early nineties game. If I wanted to wander around like a dumbass, I would have bought Silent Hill 2.Another thing is that Vice City is much smaller than Liberty City, and not as fun. Liberty City had potholes, hills, tunnels, tons of overpasses, Chinatown, a red light district, posh neighborhoods, Mafia controlled areas, six rival gangs, and was basically huge and diverse. This didn't seem to have that.Lastly, is Rockstar's emphasis on style over substance. They added eighties music. Isn't that why societies evolve and progress, in order to avoid the mistakes of past generations? Why the heck do they want to bring back the most boring decade of them all. A decade so boring, it's the only one Austin Powers hasn't even gone to. Why? Also, they decided to add more full motion video. That's fine, but they repeatedly placed them in the middle of missions, and sometimes you can't skip over them. While attempting some of the more badly designed missions, I'm forced to watch the same full motion video over and over again.There are some slight improvements. Each asset and property has a save point. Going to a golf course and riding golf carts is really fun. Also, the auto aiming is much, much easier and a real time saver.Pros:Still free rangingStill one of the better games aroundExpansion of GTA3Cons:FMVs - more style than substanceGimmicky missionsSmallerHarder finding the missions than the missions themselvesBoats, rc helicopters, bikes need to go.BugsBad AI, especially with LanceDifficulty: MediumHours to play: 30Frustration Level: High

To those who remember Al Bundy from the show Married with Children, this book would seem very similar. Mr. Biswas, from a poor family, is rushed into a marriage that he wasn't prepared for, is at the mercy of his in-laws, has a low paying career, and is stuck with a wife that hates his guts.Mr. Biswas is presented as a loser whose one goal of finding a place of his own. Without giving too much away, this book follows the simple struggle of Mr. Biswas's life. It presents a fascinating view of Trinidad and Indian families within. From crowded Indian houses, to sugarcane fields, to villages, to crowded buses, to resorts, the reader gets a great glimpse of life on the Island. The reader also gets to follow the life of this man as he struggles in his marriage, his career, with sanity, and the search for his house. Throughout his life, he lives in crowded and squalid residences, and wishes to live independently from it all. Thus the name of the book.The one flaw of this book is the monotony. Mr. Biswas did not live an exciting life, and Naipul forces the reader to look into his most mundane activities. This readability of this book greatly declines as the book nears the end.Tedious at some points, this book does a great job bringing Mr. Biswas's perspective to the reader. I would recommend this book to those with some time and patience.

When I first starting reading this book, I initially thought I made a terrible mistake in purchasing this book. Roth writes a sort of superfluous, wordy way to get the plot moving. While at first it seems like an attempt to fill pages with useless descriptions, it's actually an in-depth portrayal into a person's history, their characteristics, and their mental state.Roth describes the life of Coleman Silk, a college dean who was forced to resign because he used the word "Spooks", a word though normally harmless but could be construed as a racial slur. Through the eyes of a friend and author, Silk starts a relationship with a broken down woman half his age after this incident. What this amounts to is an interesting dichotomy between the two lovers. Later, through Roth's insights, there characteristics and psyche are portrayed more similar than different. The way Roth describes and unfolds this relationship is a great joy.Roth, unfortunately, delves in Coleman Silk's past life too much at what amounts to a typical oppressed person, black and white story. For about one third of the Book, Coleman Silk's past is described in what is nothing more than a boring epilogue.There is also the story of a the woman's ex husband. Even though it is pretty obvious and self evident overall as he is an enraged Vietnam Veteran, the part where he has to venture into a Chinese restaurant and overcome his hatred for East Asians is both intense and impressive.While the characteristics are sometimes gripping, there are without a doubt unreal. I can't imagine some of the characters in this book, especially the young French professor, to be taken seriously.Not a typical plot driven novel, this book is well worth the read though.

This is a near perfect guide. Readable, with plenty of examples, it explains everything and provides almost the all required information needed to start programming for Series 40 (and Series 60) phones - assuming you only know Java.I read this out of pure curiosity, and I must say, I learned all that I needed and much more. It taught everything from internet connectivity, automated building, testing, compiling, and security from secure minded applications to fun 2D games. It's really an amazing book that probably combines a lot of different random white papers from various different perspectives and presents in a complete, comprehensive and clear manner. The examples are informative, representative of real world applications, and are easy to follow.I found some things to be needlessly verbose, and I wish there were better summaries of objects and inheritance between the required classes, but all in all, it easily provides the foundation needed to create, debug, and test almost any J2ME mobile phone application around. I cannot recommend this highly enough.

If you are looking to learn without being inundated with useless facts or boring characters, this book is for you. It's basically the history of beer, wine, coffee, tea, soda, and hard alcohol.The author describes the origins of each drink, and their history and effects on society. While sometimes he delves into some boring realms like someone's personal history, this book still flows well. It's one of those books that flows so smoothly, you won't realize that it has ended.This is the perfect light read in which you learn something and enjoy yourself. I would recommend it as a great change of pace to most books on the market.

I needed to upgrade from my ancient first generation 32MB mp3 player for jogging. I needed a lot of memory with no moving parts (e.g. flash memory). The leaves a maximum of about 1GB in this day and age, which still holds plenty of music, audio programs, and podcasts. So I looked around and found this Creative player.So, the first question is, does it work? Yes, it does. That's the most important thing. For it's price, it does everything I need.It's small, and is the only 1GB FM radio with a belt clip, which clips nicely to my shorts. I need this, as it doesn't interfere with weight lifting like an armband would. The battery life is excellent. I've had it for three weeks, used it for 10 different workouts, and it's still running on the the same AAA battery. The player itself is pretty small and light, and is a good nice standard black color - not those horrible flashy colors I see occasionally.The 1GB, obviously, holds a lot of music. You won't be able to hold your whole music collection, but you'll probably hold all the music you'll ever want to work out to. The FM recorder works very well in case you ever get bored of your music, and it even records from FM. It doesn't work directly with iTunes, only iPods do, but using JHymn with iTunes will get you mp3s which you can then import into your player (and really, why be locked into a proprietary format by not using JHymn?).The display is nice addition. I don't know how any 1GB player could function without it (I'm talking to you iPod Shuffle). The backlight is snazzy and useful. The buttons take some getting use to. It's tough because the darn thing is so small that there is no way to make it more user friendly without adding more stuff to it. I guess it's a good trade off.It's not perfect though. The headphones are the standard cheap included headphones that almost everyone replaces anyway in every mp3 player - so it's expected. There are real two main problems though. The first is the ordering. There are no playlists. It's alphabetical order and one level of folders. To use their own software to import from a CD means that you'll be listening to things in alphabetical order. I couldn't figure out how to rename music on the player. The only way around this, I think, is to rip into your hard drive, then rename each individual song to start with 01, 02, 03, etc., and then copy it over. Not the most sophisticated, easy to use system around.The second thing is the that voice recorder is really weak. They really needed to get an amplified mic. If you try recording something, it's either a whisper because it's too far away, or staticy with reverberation because your mouth is too close to the mic.All in all, it's still the best value for a 1GB flash player. I would recommend it to anyone.Pros:Belt Clip!!Armstrap1GBNice PriceBlackVoice RecorderLCD displayBacklightGood battery usageFM RadioFM RecordingCons:Non-amplified microphone is horribleNavigation is toughNo playlists, just alphabetical order.

I'm not truly a wrestling fan, but my friends recommended this book to me, so I decided to give it a shot. Honestly, it was pretty darn good. Granted, it's not going to win the Pulitzer, but it's got to be one of the most original and well-written biographies I've ever read.This book chronicles one of the most unique individuals in wrestling's history. He wasn't the best athlete and he wasn't the best looking guy either. He only had to things going for him - his persistence and his uncanny ability of take punishment.Not only does it describe Foley's wrestling career, it delves deeply in his family and personal life, and describes the profession that is wrestling from a unique and accurate view. Often, the audience only sees wrestling as entertainment, but Foley exposes it as a full-fledged business, with employees and decisions, with economic implications for each show.What is most memorable about this book is Foley's descriptions of some of his most gruesome matches. From getting slammed into razor wire and explosives, to tearing off half his ear, he captured my interest and instilled in me some respect for professional wrestlers.The one complaint I have is that Foley kept describing match after match. This paperback is over 700 pages long, and it could have been cut somewhat. At about pages 300-500, the book becomes tedious and almost repetitve as he describes numerous wrestling contests that really didn't differ from other ones he describes.Wrestling fans will love it to death, and non-wrestling will not be disappointed.

Yeah, we all know Dilbert. Meetings are waste of time, managers are stupid, and co-workers are imbeciles. I half expected this book to be full of these cliches. Not even close. Scott Adams does an excellent job of showing the humor of a job with smart observances and clever ideas. From the absurd yet funny comics, to actual written letters from organizations, and his own personal experiences - Adams gives out humor that is relevant, funny, and pertinent. His topics range from management, to consultants, to engineers, to marketing, and much more. He touches on all facets of the workplace in a manner that couldn't be handled well in a few comic strips.I'm working and getting my MBA now, and this sort of book tends to ground me. It's a quick and easy read. Nothing special, but very smart and funny.

When I heard that the team that created Ico was going to create another game, I was excited. Ico was released years ago near the PS2's launch, and though slightly flawed, it was a wonderful game. Now that the team had time to master the PS2, it could improve the graphics and make an Ico like game even better. Well not quite.You first start off in a temple, and you have to go after a Colossus. You then ride your horse to the area where the Colossus is. The area where you ride your horse through is expansive, though nice looking, is pretty monochrome. The horse riding is a little annoying, because the camera is sort of half done, meaning that you can move the camera, but it will move back for no reason at random times, and there is no stationary camera angle. Most games give you the option of keeping the camera directly behind you so you can move by the direction of the screen. This does not, and I found it very, very annoying.Once you reach the Colossus, you face a large lumbering stone giant, and you have to defeat it. It's just like a giant boss battle. You have to climb up it somehow (which is where the "puzzle" portion comes in) and hit the weak spots.That is pretty much the game. Ride to the Colossus, defeat it, rinse, repeat. After about three Colossi, I was bored to death. This game has a total of 16 of them. Each one takes a really long time. Uh, no thanks.While the Colossi look great and the music is good, graphically, the rest of the game is fully of jaggies that really shouldn't exist in a game engine these days. The world to explore is really very empty with nothing to do. The camera angle is the biggest obstacle, and I found the controls to be awkward as well. Like all boss battles, there is a lot of repetition in defeating the boss. You get to a certain point, and you either die, or you fall and have to climb up the boss again. So, there is a lot of repeating. And no, you can't save in the middle of a boss fight.I wanted ambiance, puzzles, thinking, new worlds to explore. I wanted a new version of Ico or Prince of Persia, Sands of Time. Instead, I got this.If you are the type of guy that only cares about the final boss, this game is made for you. If you wanted another thinking man's platformer, you'd better look elsewhere.

I remember I would flip through the TV stations and get to ESPN2 and see the World Series of Poker. I use to laugh at the fact that there was a World Series of Poker, and laugh even more because it was televised. After this book, I have to admit I was wrong to do so.In this book, Andy Bellin describes every facet of poker. From how it is played, to where it is played, to whom plays it, and how it is won. He describes his own stories, those of professional poker players and of poker addicts. He details how to win, and how skill and guile are used to make serious money.To anyone who rarely or casually plays poker, this is an eye-opener. For example, he concentrates on Texas Hold Em', which he explains is the only game poker players take seriously. He goes through the history, nomenclature, the way the odds work, and how it takes years and years of practice and money loss in order to succeed. I for one didn't know how much math and observational skill it took to win. I always thought it was mostly luck.So, when I flip to ESPN2, I'll just have to stick to making fun of Soccer and Curling. Any book that can make me respect poker players is a darn good book indeed.

I never saw a horror-survival game before, and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me. So, I rented Silent Hill 2. I figured I would be scared out of my mind, battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere, hearing strange spooky sounds, basically playing the game on the edge of my seat. How wrong I was.First off, this is a sorry attempt at a game. People say this is a puzzle game. In it's loosest definition - yes it is. The same way old games like King's Quest were puzzle games. Basically, all you do is walk. That's it. You walk. Really nothing else. You walk and hope you find something. Then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else. That's it. There's no complex or intriguing puzzle, it's just search around until you grab something.That was cool, in the 1980s, when game makers needed to make 50 hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters. This is the 2000s, and there is no excuse for it now.So, all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster. That wouldn't be so bad - if they didn't make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world! To move from one end of the street to the other takes forever. The controls are sticky and clumsy, and the guy is really, really slow. Since there's fog or darkness, you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next direction.How about the environment? Not once was I scared or awed. The graphics are below par for a Playstation 2 game. The fog is cool for a second, but annoys you afterwards. The monsters are a joke. They're little bodies that couldn't frighten a 8 year old girl loaded with caffeine.Also, the "puzzles" are just plain ridiculous. For example, here's what you have to do when you enter the town. You're just in the town with no explicit instructions. So you wander, then wander some more, then you finally find a key. Big whoop, a key. Then you wander some more to find where the key goes to. So, after playing for an hour, you've opened a gate. In Grand Theft Auto 3, you would have already killed a few people, and completed some fun missions. In ICO, you would have explored a large castle, rescued a girl, and escaped dreadful spirits. This game - you only opened a damn gate. Once you're in the apartment building, you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same. Finally, after another hour, what do you get? A cool new weapon? A great story cut-scene? No - you get a flashlight. What does the flash light do? Reveal new secrets? Find new terrifying monsters? No - you can now read the map of the apartment building. Two and a half of hours of game play, and I've done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map. Bored already?What's worse is when you need to something to continue the story, but they won't tell you what. This means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you didn't do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building. Remember, moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself. After being stuck for a few hours because I didn't go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin, I knew this game had no hope. I continued on until I reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same. I promptly shut off my PS2 and returned the game to [the store].Finally, in order to save, you actually have to actively search out the save game places. This was the final straw.I kind of wanted to see the ending, but then I figured what it was. Here's a spoiler for you. The monsters that roam the town? They're not trying to kill you. Their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death, warning you to return this game immediatately!You want a good puzzle game? Get ICO instead. This game just plain [smells]. It stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of you.

Stealth games have always seemed a little awkward to me. To be fair, the only stealth games I played were Metal Gear Solid games. So, the awkward controls, horrible camera angles, and needless movies made me ignore all other stealth games. I finally decided to try Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow on a whim. Let me say, wow!First off, the controls are intuitive and easy to get accustomed to. They just feel right. The first mission is a sort of a tutorial that takes much of the mystery away from the game. The on screen meters work very well. All the actions are intuitive. They include jumping, crouching, aiming, zoom, wall hugging, peeking, throwing, whistling, etc.The best part of the game is the fun, thoughtful gameplay that is just pure joy. For example, instead of entering a room and blasting away, you need to shoot a light to get yourself completely in the dark, use an optic cable at a door to make sure it's clear, open the door to the room, shoot out any lights that you can, shoot or avoid cameras, walk to the shadows, whistle to attract a guard and knock him out. You need to this silently without getting noticed. This approach to game playing is both refreshing and revolutionary when done right, as it is done here. When the flow of the game is moving along (the first half of the game), it's just plain addictive.There are numerous flaws that take away from this game though. The biggest flaw is the fact that you cannot save anytime you want. Even though the checkpoints are numerous, in many circumstances you'll still have to kill the same two guards over and over again. This is further amplified by the fact some missions (the latter ones) are not well designed or lack information. For example, the fifth mission is probably the worst. You need to follow a person who sometimes can see behind his back. Sometimes, I would get mission failure for almost no reason. For example, for an hour and a half, I kept getting failures without any explanation. Only when looking at a walkthrough on the Internet did I realize why I failed and what I needed to do. This was not fun.Also, the latter mission get annoying. There are entirely too many enemies. It moves from a stealth game to a shooter. This is not that bad in itself, but the shooting is pretty random with the pistol, and for the main gun, ammo is very limited for some reason in random missions (you have no idea when you need to save ammo and when you can shoot more freely), and close up fighting is akward. Walking up to a persona and hitting someone fails about 20% for really no fallable reason. Another annoying factor is the jumping. There are many ledges that seem like you can jump onto, only to find out you can't, and there are many ledges that can be jumped onto, but the awkward jump only works about 1/4 the time.Also, there is multiplayer. There is no slit-screen co-op mode, so that took away a lot of the fun. There is on-line competition where it's two against two, but being fodder for a bunch of anonymous gaming nerds does not appeal to me, so I didn't bother with multiplayer.All in all, it's a good game. Remove the flaws and define and refine the latter missions, and this would be one of the greatest games ever.Pros:MethodicalIntuitive controlsGood graphicsAdjustable cameraEmphasis on thought and strategyCons:Random lack of ammoUneven missionsClose up action feels awkwardPistol shots to head is almost randomJumping seems weirdLatter Mission design sometimes unintuitive or lack informationMultiplayer is worthless (no co-op!)Time to Complete: 20 hoursDifficulty: MediumFrustration Level: Medium

This is my second book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld. After reading Going Postal, I had some high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, this book doesn't flow well, nor does it maintain an interest level.Basically, a writer comes upon a printing press and almost haphazardly starts a newspaper. While an interesting concept, the characters and tangents that dominate this book becomes a little too much.While not a terrible read, it's not the smoothest read either. The depths into fantasy are not my taste, especially the needless descriptions of gollums, trolls, and vampires. Some parts bored me silly.All in all, it's decent, but I cannot recommend it.

Many books talk about the joys of Christmas. This book, however, moves away from the fantasy vision and delves into the reality - the cost, the effort, and the stress. A man's only daughter moves out of the country for the first time, and decides that instead of spending the six thousand dollars on Christmas, he'll go with his wife on a cruise. While a good idea, it seemed like every force in the neighborhood didn't want him to skip Christmas.It's filled with light humor and good observations. On a deeper note, it deals with conformity in a society. Both work and are enjoyable.As usual, Grisham is fluid and writes a good tale. His non-law books are the best, not because he can't make a good legal thriller, but that he's a much better storyteller instead.Unfortunately, he adds a little plot twist in the middle of the book, resulting in a cheesy, happily ever after ending that didn't fit with the book.At less than 200 pages, this book is a quick read, but perhaps not the best value.

The first Sly Cooper was a simple cel-shaded stealth that was both easy and fun. This one, the sequel is also cel-shaded stealth based game, but this time the little levels are replaced with a few giant episodes with multiple missions within that episodes.There are three characters that can be controlled, Bentley, a little turtle with bombs, Murray, a hippo with punching power, or the character you'll primarily play as, Sly, a racoon who can jump and pickpocket. There are eight episodes, each one requires either one of the characters to move towards one place in the level in order for the mission to start. Each mission usually consists of pickpocketting or sneaking around with Sly, smashing or carrying stuff with Murray, , or participating in a mini mission with Bentley (either a 2-D flying shooter or a low tech move a triangle through an obstacle course thingy - both are pretty boring).While the description is pretty basic, the unfortunate thing is that that is pretty much it. For 20 hours, you will constantly move traverse to one part of a level, which is sometimes not trivial, view a slideshow, do a few of the things described above, and repeat over and over again. The eight episodes are different looking in some aspects, but it's still the same thing over and over again. After a while I find myself screaming at the game, "Sly can pickpocket, I get it, can I do something different?"The good thing is that the game engine is fantastic. The jumping, the sneaking, the graphics, the controls are all well done. If they shortened the game, added some different types of missions, and removed a lot of the repetitiveness, it would be one of the greatest games ever. Another great thing is that even though most of the missions are the same, you rarely repeat parts of a mission because if you die or get caught, you usually don't have to start the whole mission over again. It really cuts down on the frustration. Also, the game is really balanced in terms of difficulty. It's never really hard at any one point, and the later levels don't leave a bad taste in your mouth like other games where the make the final parts of the game nearly impossible.In terms of graphics, it's overall very well done. Usually an episode consists of a small town, castle or prison that is both cartoony (in a good way), yet very detailed. A lot of time and effort was done making the episodes. The only problem I had was that color scheme was pretty similar, making it look monochromatic after a while.The movies are decent, though most of it was in slide shows format, but you still get a lot without interrupting the action.All in all, it's quite a different game from the first one. In some aspects it's much, much better, but overall, it just wasn't as fun.Pros:Huge levels require lots of exploringGood mixture of stealth and thieveryRequires little repeating of missionNever really stuck at any one placeGood graphicsNo guide requiredGood balanceCons:Same basic missions over and over againRequires traversing the same terrain over and over againJust plain annoying after a whileMini games are stupid and lameTime to complete: 20 hoursFrustration level: low/mediumDifficultly level: low

I never seen this game on the PC, but when it came out a few years ago, it got rave reviews. So, I decided to check it out on the PS2. Uhm, I shouldn't have. It's one of the GTA 3 clones, and the worst one yet.First off, the graphics are great for a console. The city resembles a little of Chicago of the 1930s. The gameplay is decent, the navigation is easy. There are no random search for items, backtracking, or impossible missions. The constant save points tend to limit replaying the same part of the level over and over again. The cutscenes, though sometimes are really dull and cliched, are decent enough to be watched.Though it tried to be like GTA3, It's unlike GTA3 in that the city and the missions are not seamlessly integrated. It's basically drive to one place, and cut to the third person perspective. Not that immersive.The driving is horrendous. Definitely not as bad as the Getaway, but really slow and dull. The police will sometimes stop you for speeding. It's really more irritating than realistic. The cars themselves are pretty clunky, though they improve somewhat later. Finally, there really is nothing fun to do while driving. They made it as dull as, well, driving across town in a station wagon. Mostly all the missions require you to drive from a bar to some other part of town, and it's really mostly the same road. There is no fun in exploring. The music is some 1930s slow classical jazz that either annoys you or puts you to sleep.The third person perspective is fine, except for a couple of glaring glitches. When an enemy comes up close to you, the firing mechanism just entirely fails. They just ignore your shots and punch you to death or kill you with one shot. Another bug is the fact that shooting at someone is completely random. It might take one shot to kill a guy, but if you repeat the mission, it might take six head shots the next time. Vice Versa the other way. You might get blown away in one shot, while other times you'll traverse a huge mission while only losing ten percent of your health.Finally, the continuity of the game is just wrong. Almost every mission starts off with a load time and a cutscene, and another load time. Then you have to get a gun right down the alley, this entails another cutscene. Then a car right down the stairs, which has another cutscene. Then you leave the head quarters, which triggers some more load time. Usually you have to drive to the other side of the town. The worst part is, while driving, the other half of the city triggers another load time. It takes about ten to twenty minutes to actually start the mission. About one third of my playing time was devoted to this stupidity. Really, they couldn't just have given me the car, weapon, and start me off at the correct building and saved my sanity? Really? Also, in other parts of the missions, the automatic save points and other loading times lull me into sleep. Some of the hardest parts of some missions was staying awake.Pros:Good graphicsEasy NavigationCutscenes are goodNo walkthrough neededAutomatic save helpsCons:Dull drivingLoading timeUseless drivingMissions contain useless partsClose range firing bugsUneven combatLack of continuityCannot save at any pointBad musicTime to complete: 15 hoursDifficulty: Easy to MediumFrustration Level: Medium to High

This game is the anti-thesis of all those old, tired, formulaic video games out there. I think most people are perfectly sick of going through the same type of level in first/third person, fight small aliens/monsters/demons along the level, and be frustrated with the major boss at the end of it. We've all seen this a thousand times? Where's the originality? There is nothing more frustrating than investing so much time in a game just to stop because a particular puzzle/monster/boss is too hard or the AI is too cheap. This game is the answer to those who feel this way.When I first got this game, I was a bit skeptical because it's a farming RPG. How fun could that be? Well, guess what, it is pretty fun. You start off as a young man who was left a farm. You're job is to feed yourself, know you neighbors, make money, marry someone, and raise a kid. It sounds boring yes, but the enjoyment comes in learning how to accomplish everything. You explore, make friends, experiment, etc. There is no need to worry about dying or messing up. All you have to do is live your life.In terms of friends and family, you meet certain individuals and try to make friends with them. You also have your choice of three eligible bachelorettes to marry. In the first year, you must pursue the particular girl you want by talking to them, giving them appropriate gifts, etc. The next year, you have a kid. During the later years, your kid will grow up and pursue a certain career, depending on your wife, friends and own actions.In terms of money, there are numerous ways to make a living. You can milk cows, sell animals, plant crops, plant trees, sell vegetables, fruits, wool, eggs. You can fish, produce seeds, butter, or other food products as well. The possibilities are numerous. In the beginning, you hardly have any information. As time progresses and wealth improves, you can start doing more and more.There are a few bad parts to this game. You live in one small town and after a few days, there is not much to explore any more. The town could have been more lively, with more buildings and people. The monotony is also apparent, especially while farming. In Harvest Moon time, there are 40 days in a year, and each day takes about a half hour to complete. Much of that time will be doing the same routine over and over again. The worst example is watering the plants. You need to water each sapling/tree/root individually, making it very, very dull at times.In the end though, it's a neat, relaxing video game that sure is a nice break from all the other crud produced out there.Pros:Exploring and learning is fun.No set-backs (backtracking, dying, etc.).No set way to do anything.Cons:The monotony is truly boring at some points.The town in quite small.Frustration Level: Low/MediumDifficulty Level: LowTime: 20 hours to play a year (8 years max)

uliet Schor gives a description of the American consumer and it's passion for buying useless things. While informative, she tends to ignore problems of housing, education, and taxes and concentrates on single or couples and there problems.This book is very good in that she does her research and she does it well. Unlike the book, "Affluenza", she doesn't resort to deriding people, but instead gives informed and statistically valid opinions. She tends to know who to place the blame on, the consumer's themselves.She describes an accurate portrayal of "keeping up the Jones", and how that is now a skewed view in which results in a constant race against debt and time. She also goes into shopping therapy and the sub-conscious need for status and style.All in all, it works for some people. This is great knowledge for empty-nesters or people living in cheaper parts of the country with no family. Most of the information is useless to families, as expensive clothes and new cars probably pale in comparison to housing costs. To me, that makes this book incomplete, and the title misleading, as her "solutions" don't even address the average American family.

To anyone who thought that GTA 3 was revolutionary, but was disappointed with the Vice City's emphasis on gimmicks and movies over gameplay, and the Getaways lack of any useful Navigation system, this game is for you. Out of all the GTA type games out there (GTA 3, True Crime, GTA Vice City, Simpsons Hit and Run, and The Getaway), this is definitely the second best game on that list.This game starts off with a huge part of L.A. While not a replica of the city (like the Getaway is with London), it has all the streets, parks, landmarks and freeways of the LA area. When I mean huge, I mean huge. While on an uncongested freeway, burning rubber, it still takes a considerable amount of time to get from one side of the map to other. The city map is a little too vague, but the on screen map in intuitive, and more importantly, street names are presented on screen, so you'll know if you're on Santa Monica Blvd or if you're on Highway 405. Also, the cars handle really well, the traffic is sparse and smart, and with your customized music, it's a joy to just zoom around.This brings up the music portion. It's almost all rap, with a few heavy metal songs filled in. I'm not talking just some no name artists (but most of them are), but there is also major names, like Snoop Dogg, Warren G., N.E.R.D, and heck, I think there is MegaDeath as well. All the music is made to fit the atmosphere. The best part is, it's customizable. There are three different sections for three different types of gameplay (cruisin', slow action, fast action), each with about 15 unique songs each to play or not play. Simply amazing - I would say over 40 songs. The only problem is that you can't mix one type of music (e.g. slow action) with another type (e.g. cruisin'). So while I like the N.E.R.D song "LapDance", I can only hear it in certain situations.Now to the gameplay. There are three basic types of missions - outdoor ones involving driving through the city, indoor one with gunfire, and indoor ones with martial arts fighting. All of these missions are short, so there is not much repeating or backtracking. The outdoor ones are the ones where it shines. The city is immense. Unfortunately, the missions do tend to be on the easy side, and are either tailing, racing, escaping, or just get to a destination. The indoor ones are not quite as fun, but the auto-aiming combined with bullet time movement makes it enjoyable, despite the camera conspiring against you. The fighting is slightly more annoying, as it is more button mashing than anything else, but again, it's doable. I hate all fighting games, so to me, it was the weakest type of mission.The missions are combined into episodes. Each episode has six to eight missions, and there are eight missions to get to the best ending. There are two alternative endings that branch off, giving a grand total of 12 episodes in all. The best part is that all the missions are straight forward. You don't have to look into guidebooks or ask your friends for special tricks to beat any of these missions. Even so, beating all the missions are not required, so if there are some missions that are annoying or hard, you can skip them. This might result in alternative missions or missing some other missions altogether. Either way, you're never stuck.There are also side mission you can do to upgrade your skills, or you can search random people on the street, or stop crimes and run down common criminals.The only problem I have is one episode where it detracts from any sort of realism and where you fight demons, zombies, and dragons. A couple of these missions were extremely repetitive and so badly designed that it almost made me lose respect for this game.All in all, it's a fantastic, immense, and polished game that I can't recommend highly enough.Pros:Huge cityMusicCustomization of musicGraphicsNothing too difficultNo gimmicks, guidebooks neededCons:Dragons and demons missionsToo many indoor missionsFighting was pretty lameCamera angle is bad in tight spacesDifficulty Level: Easy/MediumFrustration Level: LowHours to Complete (100% of all episodes, all endings): 20 hours

This book and series is so dull and repetitive, at points I felt like I was reading the second or third book of the series again. The wit is beyond dull, the characters are now beyond boring, and plot has slowed to a crawl.There are some fights between demons and armies, but the reader needs to trudge through the most dull aspects of the book to get to them.The good aspect of this book is that at least there is a sense that the travels and the monotony will end, and the final prophecy will take place. The evil sorceress, Zandramas, tries to slow them down, while the Seeress tries to keep the prophecy going.As usual, more of the prophecy is revealed, is slow, boring detail.Out of the 400 or so pages, only about 20 pages mattered.

Before a long road trip, I picked up the abridged audio book from the library. I figured you couldn't go wrong with such a proficient novelist as Anne Rice. Well, I was mistaken. Though not even close to as bad as the audio version of Queen of the Damned, this book is far too unbelievable for me to take seriously.A mummy, named Ramses, is discovered, and with a little help from sunlight, rejuvenates himself and falls madly in love with the discoverer's daughter. You with me here? He prevents a relative from murdering her, and goes back to Egypt to look for his lover ancient lover Cleopatra. Stop laughing please. He finds her, gives her a potion of immortality, and she turns evil and starts killing. Then she seduces the discoverer's daughter's ex-fianc&eacute;e. Got it so far? Then there is a final battle between the good Ramses and the evil Cleopatra. You already knows who wins.This book switches back and forth from a lousy story to a wanna-be soft porn and should be avoided. Maybe the unabridged book is better, but I could not see how.I would not recommend this book.

In this book, David Kushner documents the lives of two influential game programmers, John Romero and John Carmack - the guys who created Doom and id Software. It chronicles the lives, the company, the gaming industry, and the impact of these two young computer geniuses. It's a quick, fluid read that is not only entertaining, but is awe inspiring as well.This is a fascinating book on many fronts. It describes how two kids got into games from the early childhoods, describes their fascination with computers in general, and their dreams. It goes from a tale of two kids with ideas, to their technological innovations, to business start, to their monumental growth, and finally to their fallout. It sheds light not only independent game programming, but of the type of people who develop and play these first person shooters like Doom.Not only is this a biography, or a game book, it's also sort of the &quot;startup.com&quot; of the gaming world. With a good mixture of business, gaming, with unique and individual characters, it indirectly describes the world of gaming companies and what it takes to make a good, and bad, company.While a good book for all, it's a must for anyone who loves games or is into software development.

Okay, first off, I didn't glance at this game; I immersed myself in this game. Please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great. I played approximately 10 exhibition games, a twenty game season with playoffs, created players, and explored all the various game modes, and played quite a few 2 player games. This game really seems to capture the essence of baseball. Notice I used the word "seems". When looking at this game in depth, this game has no long-term playability.First off, the graphics are terrible. I mean really, really terrible. It's almost like they transported the player graphics from Super Nintendo land. The feel of baseball is almost deadened after looking at the super cheap animations. Of course in most sports games, graphics shouldn't matter. This is baseball though - the ambience, the look of the grass, the feel of the crowd, the skyline, all contribute to good game. This hampers it.I would gladly sacrifice graphics for a good game. At first, I thought it did. After a few exhibition games, I felt like they finally reached the holy pantheon of sporting games, to be seated next to Madden 97 and the original NHL for the PC, NBA 2K and NFL2K for the Dreamcast, Lakers vs. Celtics for the Genesis, and Baseball Simulation 2000 (yes, 2000, even though it was released in the 80s) for the original NES. My hopes quickly faded.The games' pitching-batter interface is very polished, and definitely is the game. Unfortunately, it's full of glitches. In one camera angle, the high and low pitches are distinct, but outside and inside pitches are awful. In another angle, the exact opposite occurs. Why not have an angle that can show both? In two others angles, it's just plain impossible to judge anything. Curveballs are a plain joke, and couldn't even fool Jeremy Burnitz, while sliders and change-ups are just plain evil to hitters.Don't get me started on the Home run contest. I hit ten home runs on ten pitches with Shinjo. With Barry Bonds, the only way not to hit a home run is to not make contact.In terms of long-term play, I started off in pro level, and after steady improvement, I easily mastered it and progressed into all-star level. All of sudden, my team was chalked full of Jose Cansecos and Dave Kingmans. Even though I averaged three to four runs a game, almost all my runs were off home runs, the vast majority being solo shots. Troy Glaus drove in more than half my runs. For the very few times I got a single, the next at-bat resulted in a double play. This type of game would bore any true baseball fan to death.So my offense stagnated, but I won approximately half my games on all-star level. Then I noticed something. Mostly all the games I played were one run games. Out of these, the games were decided in the last two innings. All of them. No matter how much I altered the simulation level, the game would massage the abilities to make it a close score. Any true baseball fan, like me, would be revolted. Part of baseball consists of 12-1 games along with the 3-2 games. Closers proved worthless. To test my hypothesis, I chose to play the Angels versus the Yankees in the playoffs. In every game that I was leading going into the eighth, my pitchers couldn't throw any strike except right down the middle, and all the Yankees became the re-incarnation of Barry Bonds. Even though I could easily strike out Bernie Williams in the second inning, I would give up walk upon walk to Alfonso Soriano. Of course, constantly walking Alfonso is not just a minor glitch; it's release-stopping bug! While losing, Troy Percival would be pitch like Byun Hung Kim in the World Series. After he gives up the lead, he'd pitch just like Pedro. This type of things flies in the face of actual simulation and just plain ruins the game. I found myself not trying to score in the fifth and sixth inning so I can have a chance of winning.So, the earlier innings are a waste, and the offense is boring as heck, the computer's AI sacrifice's the very notion of simulation, the graphics are terrible, and it's full of annoying glitches. Why would anyone want to play this game? A baseball game is made to be played for a long time, and this doesn't come close. The only thing that redeems is it is that it's still pretty good in two player. Of course, try to get a friend to come over and play a whole season - good luck.Baseball is the hardest game to simulate, and this game just could measure up. I wasted some serious cash on this, so I hope you don't.

Pallos explains the concepts of mathematics and how it relates to the stock market. Is there financial analysis that can lead to increasing market gains? Is it all random? If it is random, why is everyone trying to beat the system and get better returns? If there are inefficiencies, why haven't they haven't been exploited yet?He goes into such topics as the psychology of losses, the analysis of risk, the diversification of portfolios, and how it all relates to strategies, probabilities, and many mathematical topics. He often interjects how he went against common mathematical theories by personally sticking with his WorldCom stock during it's huge crash.It's hard to explain or give a synopsis of this book because it really doesn't have a concrete point, nor does it really have anything that really stands out. It's a bunch of somewhat interesting mathematical concepts that either loosely or strongly correlate to the stock market.All in all, it's a decent easy read, but nothing eye-opening or memorable.

My dad use to work for Ford in the late seventies, so he bought Fords well into the early eighties. So, as a kid growing up the eighties, all I saw was my dad trying to fix the Fords in the late eighties. I actually thought that a car breaking down every few months was actually normal. Needless to say, I own a Toyota now. So this book intrigued me. How could a company that my father was proud of revive itself to something that I might consider purchasing a product from?Well, this book describes Bill Ford's life and the life of the Ford Motor company. To address the negatives first, while mostly honest, he tends to overestimate how bad things have gotten in the nineties while and overestimates how good Ford is in the present day and in the not so recent past. He gives the impression that Ford's quality issues and their financial problems were recent problems that are totally resolved. He makes Bill Ford look like a super genius who fixed everything in his first few year.Now to point out the good. This book is part history lesson, part biography, part financial, part business book all mixed into one. Magee actually goes into depth with not just mere anecdotes and Bill Ford's life story, but gets into numbers and processes. He talks about management styles, he talks about strategies. He delves into design and the competition. More importantly, he brings a lot of relevant and pertinent information in a fluid, quick manner that doesn't bog down the reader.I will definitely read more books from this author, and for anyone interested in the automotive industry, or anyone interested in large corporations, this book is a must read.

I finally decided to check out Terry Pratchett. I'm usually weary of fantasy books, as it sometimes gets a little too Dungeon and Dragony for my tastes. However, this book is quite an interesting little taking on the workings of the economy and the postal service.This book turns out to be quite a page turner. The main character is forced to operate the post office, a place not run in decades. What turns out to be a seemingly useless endeavor turns out to be a huge success. What follows is a clever microcosm of business, economics, and entrepreneurship.The fantasy level is turned down a notch, making it a great novel that flows well. I highly recommend this book.

I read about twenty books between this Harry Potter and the last one, so previous details are not fresh in my memory. I would have wished they included a summary of the previous books. I'm not a hard core Harry Potter fan. I'm a casual reader of all books, so I kind of need to be reminded about certain details.However, this book is immensely readable for a book this size. In a strange note, I think this is the first book where the number pages did not increase over the last one. Anyway, I was easily able to finish it a mere weekend, which speaks volumes about the fluidity of such a book. Rowling delves into Voldermert's past, brings about treachery, and does so much more.So yeah, it's a great book. Even though J.K. Rowling can buy and sell me at her will, I will still contribute to her ever growing empire when the next book comes out.

I've heard the reviews saying that Devil May Cry was one of the greatest games ever. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it is a good game. Devil May Cry is a fight and slash game with a haunting background and a terrible storyline. It does work well though, and flows nicely.This game has some problems, but those are not problems that detract from the gameplay too wildly. First off, it commits the greatest cardinal sin or all time - you cannot save at any point. This immediately means that at least some of the game will contain repetition. My second biggest gripe is the camera angle is situated at stationary spots. It does not follow you around like other games. Worse, is that when you move, the camera angle will switch to a vastly different view. This ranges from inconvenient when navigating a room, to hellish when you're running and jump attacking a monster and the room suddenly flips on you. I also thought the front end and menus were a little unintuitive, and the fact that you couldn't adjust the music and sound volume separately was also annoying.The game starts off with a bad storyline, and then Dante, whom you play, is placed into a dark foreboding castle, where the entire game takes place. It's safe to say this background rates up there with Final Fantasy 10 and Ico. You then fight your way through different small levels, collecting orbs and objects to advance to the next level. At about the third level, you can choose which difficulty you can play. With the easiest level, you can just hack and slash and special attacks will be automatically done. In the harder levels, you can do those stupid random up up down A B L3 right down down combo moves that are in Fighter games. Needless to say, I took the more straightforward level.The game consists of a little over 20 missions. Some missions consist of moving from one place to another, others are a little more complex in that it requires you to gather an object and place it with an another, and some require you to beat a boss. Either way, the missions rarely consist of backtracking, there is little wandering or not knowing where you are going, and there is a little repetition. The movies are rare and skippible, so the action is rarely interrupted. This means that the game has a great flow.All in all, it's a good game. As a greatest hits game, it's a superb value.Pros:Haunting atmosphere.Which difficulty selected determines type of game.Great flow.Hardly any pointless wandering.Cons:Fixed CameraCannot save at any pointTime:12 hours (easy difficulty)Frustration Level:Low

This is a simple, yet frustrating platform game. This thing has no originality to it whatsoever. Then again, no one should expect that. First off, it's a neat game. Controlling Pac-Man and navigating that little yellow ball through lush environments is a joy. Pac-Man goes through greens, forests, snow, seas, and a spooky swamp. The fact that such a retro figure would be updated to a modern day game is a great thing.Now, the bad part. This is game is very, very, cheap. I guess the developers wanted to lengthen the game play without doing extra work. They just made some parts really hard. The second to last boss will make you want to slam your controller. You?ll swear you made a jump correctly, only to fall to your death. To add to that, the camera angles are a complete mess. In fact, it's so severe, I'm surprised the QA department let it go through. Sometimes you?ll be able to alter the camera view, but when you have to make the jump quickly (as many jumps in the second half), there's no time. The camera will switch angles right before the jump, or you'll make a blind jump, and will give you fits. This terrible visual perspective will make you want to kill the game engine developers. Couple this with the fact that you can?t save at the points you want, and you'll be repeating stuff a lot. To show how annoying the game is, just check out the commercial. You'll see they gave Pac-Man over 100 lives. The commercial producers had to cheat to get the screen shots.Finally, they wanted to add some variety, so they added swimming, skating, and a submarine. These levels are very one-dimensional, and the skating really suffers from the jumping problems mentioned earlier.All in all, it's a good old fashioned, fun, platform game that doesn't stretch your intellect, but could prove really, really frustrating.ProsPac Man looks so cuteIt's Pac Man, c'mon.Great graphicsConsTypical platform -sort of a carbon copy of Rayman 2 and Sonic from DreamcastThe camera angle is terribleNot hard, but very, very cheapBad variationsTime: 12 hoursDifficulty: Medium to HardFrustration: High

Heffernan describes the story of the Globe, a tragic whaling ship that went through a mutiny led by Samuel Comstock. The book goes into the childhood of Samuel, the ship prior to the mutiny, the mutiny, and more importantly, the aftermath.Heffernan describes the life of a Nantucket shipsman, life on a ship, and life on an island with natives. The survival of two Americans on a foreign tropical island is truly fascinating, and is gripping. The story itself is a great piece of non-fiction. Definitely movie making material. Unfortunately, the author couldn't convey this excitement in the most efficient way.His language tends not to be fluid. He goes into details that are unnecessary and sometimes boring. He also tends to bring in first person perspectives and quotes which interrupt the continuity, and are sometimes hard to decipher.An interesting story, but the book could have definitely been written better. I would recommend this book if you're sick of typical fiction though

No matter what age group is reading this, this book is gripping. Though I would consider its predecessor slightly better, but this book is definitely worth the time and money for a long book (relative to the previous books in the series).The book sees Harry Potter grow into an even a better magician, not only battling the dark lord, but also gossip, girls, and any other thing a fifteen year old has to deal with.With the exception of the last 150 pages, the book flies by. The end of the book is somewhat tedious, as needless descriptions are presented, while the "action" is slow and boring. Revise the ending, and you've got a perfect book.

This is a good guide to the world religions. All the topics seem to be covered, and it's a good introduction. It concentrates on all the major religions, and also delves into the smaller know religions and different sects of the major religion. I can honestly say I know more after reading this bookOne thing I found annoying was the lack of consistency with the reporting of each religion. It would have been helpful if Pollack told the same information for each religion. He should start of with history, then the amount of worshipers, then where are they located, then what type of gods do they believe in, and so on. He tends to leave out a lot of information, whether due to his lack of information, or do to oversight. There are numerous examples, such as he explains that Buddhism overlaps with Hinduism. But how, where, and why? He doesn't explain, or his explanation was unclear. He writes a chapter about Jainism, but I never figured out if the Jains had a God or not. He doesn't give an approximation to the number of religious devotees to many religions, so I don't how major the religion is or not.Despite these flaws, it's still a very good book for the curious.

Here's my Haiku:Great IdeaOriginal and UniqueVery Badly DoneI rented this game with no instructions. The first thing I noticed was that there was a tutorial. This tutorial was slow torture, but I learned some things. Then I started the game. The Graphics were pretty good, and I sensed that some great stuff was going to happen. I started off nicely, explored around, and I got killed. So I started again, explored some other parts, and got killed again. This time I decided to avoid getting killed.That's when this game got dull. Really, really dull. I played for two hours, painfully walking from one place to another. The fighting, though interesting at first, was monotonous. The setting soon became boring. Worst of all, I wanted to save. For the love of Goodness I kind not find out how to save. The controls and tutorials taught me everything else but how to do. After playing for three hours straight, I turned off my PS2, hoping the game was saved automatically. It wasn't, and I wasn't going to repeat those three hours of gameplay, so I said forget it.I promptly returned it to the video store, hoping that the few hours that the game resided in my house didn't lower my property value. This game was cheap. First of all, there were no voices at all. Voice actors are not expensive, yet they couldn't even afford that. Secondly, there is no compass. Many times I would want to go north, but I could only hope I was walking there. I could only check when I reached a new area whether I went north, south, east or west. Finally, you can not save immediately. Granted, I could have looked it up how to do it on the internet, but by that time I realized this game wasn't even worth it.It's a great idea, terrible execution. Avoid this game at all costs.

This book is called Origins of the Crash. I would think that this would be an all encompassing book describing both the irrationality of all aspects of the stock bubble that burst, relying on firm statistics, polls and the such. However, instead, this book concentrates on just a few corporations and a few select people, and is just left to the reader to extrapolate this to the entire market. While I don't disagree with the actions of a few select people or corporations helped precipitate the decline in stocks, I didn't see how that explained everything, and I see this book as an incomplete exercise.While the title is huge misnomer, the explanation of corruption, cronyism, false beliefs, lack of credibility and accountability is very well done. He talks about how CEO pay and their pay structure are not aligned with shareholder value. He goes into how the SEC was very lax during this time. He spends a brief amount of time on the conflict of interests between investment houses and corporations (and the media's role). He then delves into the internet fallacies that many saw as gospel in the late nineties. He finally ends with a detailed explanation of the problems of Enron/Anderson and Worldcom.While detailed and mostly readable (though dry at some points), there was also a sense of smugness and a condescension that I felt hurt his credibility.All in all, it's a decent, yet incomplete read.

Aczel has a way of making the most mundane really interesting. He wrote one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read in Fermat's Last Theorem. With this book, he continues his combination of a math book with the movement, clarity, and pace of a novel. The unfortunate part about this book is that no matter how good Aczel tries, the subject of infinity is not as interesting.This is a chronicle with some mathematicians' obsession with, and the history of, the concept of infinity. First, he goes into the ancient origins of infinity, from Pythagoras to the discovery of irrational numbers, to the Jewish sect that dealt with infinity. Then he explains Galileo, Bolzano, and others' perspectives and expansion of infinity, including set theory.The most important part deals with George Cantor, a man who expanded upon, and ultimately went insane trying to figure out infinity. He details his steps towards madness, and his views on set theory, it's axioms, and the concept of order of infinity.Unfortunately, though told brilliantly told, doesn't capture the interest that Fermat's Last Theorem elicited. The concept of infinity, and it's order, is not that interesting a subject, as it lacks a practical purpose, and is not a problem that many have dealt with, educational or otherwise.Overall though, it's a very good book, and I highly recommend it.

The Sands of Time was perhaps the best adventure game in console history, and one of my favorite games of all time. The Warrior Within was an attempt to cash on in the prestige of Sands of Time by making an action game with the PoP name and interface, with mixed results. The Two Thrones tries to solve many of the Warrior Within minor problems, but in the end, is probably the worst of the three.First the good. The Prince of Persia series offers the best atmosphere and jumping mechanics in video gaming history. There is nothing more satisfying that moving from one part of the palace to another. The jumps are intuitive, and the scenery is just plain amazing. In this department, it will not dissapoint.Now the bad. First of all, it feels just like Warrior Within, so it doesn't offer anything fresh. I felt like I have already played this game. It's not as fight heavy as Warrior Within, but it's more of an action game than the previous two, which is PoP's worst aspect.Yes, you do have the some nice puzzles, and occasionally, a huge room or garden that looks amazing. There are places which require thought and adventure. However, out of the twelve hours of gameplay, this barely compromises one fourth of my playing time. I spent more time total on the second chariot race and boss than I did on all the environment puzzles combined. Not because the boss and race and huge, complex missions, but because they designed so that when you fail late, you have to repeat all the beginning stuff over and over. I almost gave up at the end due to this amateurish game design. It's a classic case of extending gameplay without putting any further effort into it. Pure laziness on the game developers' part, and it shows.The other times are with the Dark Prince or in missions involving traps and blades. Since you play as the Dark Prince, whose powers constantly dwindle, you need to make fast jumps and quick decisions. Often times I got fed up and used a walkthrough, because I couldn't stand progressing a little further, dying, replaying in order to get slight farther, than dying, then do it again and again. It was so boring. The blades and traps and trial and error jumps get ridiculous near the end and mean a lot of deaths and time rewinds, just adding to the frustrationThey also added Quick kill, a sort of stealth killing system for an enemy or two that requires exact button mashing timing. Now, this is a nice idea, but is so finicky and annoying that I just gave up and started killing as normal. Sure, there is much less fighting in the game in general, but the annoyance factor is still there.Finally, you have boring bosses and repetitive mini-games like chariot races that bore you be it's mediocrity, and frustrate you through it's constant replaying of the earlier part of the fight or race.This series is trying to be an action series, betraying the bold, yet amazing risk that was the Sands of Time. It may be fun for many quick fingered action game lovers out there, but as a player who values atmosphere and thought more than button tapping accuracy, this may be my last Prince of Persia game.Pros:Sands of Time like puzzlesSame PoP interfaceSame great graphicsBetter music than Warrior WithinIntuitive movementsCons:Very unbalancedUneven save pointsVery tiring near the endQuick kill is too finickyBosses require repetitionPitch black lightingLike every other action game out thereRandom jumpsDark Prince is terribleNo reverse Y-axis for the cameraCliched boss, story, etc.Difficulty: Medium (Easy level)Frustration Level: Medium/HighHours to complete: 12 hours

I'll be the first one to admit, platform action hack and slash games are usually not my cup of tea. However, I heard many great things about God of War. So I tried it out, and yes, it's pretty darn good.First off, it's really a hack and slash game, but with easy to use combos and blocking techniques, with a slight mixture of platforming. It's extremely polished and well done. The enemies are smarter than average, well animated, and overall pretty well made. The scenery and playing atmosphere is near the top of all console games ever made, with ICO and Prince of Persia barely surpassing it. The action is also good solid fun.The backgrounds and levels vary tremendously, and they all look and feel spectacular. You have ships, Hades, deserts, Athens, and more. Since I'm not that fond of fighting games, I stuck with easy mode. With that, the fights were really easy, but that's all right with me. The puzzle, though only a few, are good too, sometimes slightly annoying, but all in all pretty fun and harmless. Usually the puzzle consists of moving a rock here or there to open a door or something like that. The platform elements are not really up to par with the rest of the game, but it doesn't detract too much.The fighting elements are really what stand out. Mostly, it's the graphics and animations that do it. The fighting itself is pretty fun as well. Their are quite a few weapons to use and magic spells to cast, and each can be upgraded and each work well in certain situations. The action is smooth, fast paced, and at times crazy. Sometimes it's a little too crazy.The game flows well. The cutscenes are hollywood caliber and are captivating. The constant regeneration points and save points allow the game to continue with very little repetition, meaning that the 15 hours of gameplay is a true 15 hours of gameplay. It's also pretty well balanced. The latter third of the game gets a bit tough, but not exponentially hard like other games like this.The main problem I had was that it was just a little too repetitive. There are only so many times one can defeat the same enemy before being bored to death. If I was on a harder difficulty, I can see frustration brewing because of wave after wave coming, to only die at the last wave.All in all, it's a great game for it's genre, and I would recommend it to all.Pros:PolishedGreat GraphicsGreat cutscenesAction packedCons:Static cameraRepetitveTime to complete: 15 hoursDifficulty level (on easy): EasyFrustration level (on easy): Low/Medium

Eddings' writing style is readable, and that's the only way anyone can finish this book. This is one of the most repetitive and useless books in the world. Here's what happens throughout the whole book. They ride into a place with a lengthy description that means nothing to the reader, every character makes a bad, monotonous wisecrack about another's character's trait, they discover a little bit of information about a prophecy that we all know is going to take place, which we know who is going to win.This time, they ride into Nyssia, and then into Murgo. They talk to a few people, and everyone does their own thing. About ten pages out of the 400 or so pages further the plot along, and that's about it.It's boring, dull, and should not have been written.

To tell you where I'm coming from, I'll should just say this - GTA 3 is the greatest console game ever - when I first got on a Friday afternoon, I didn't do anything until I completed it Sunday night. I even liked GTA Vice City, and I completed in a more casual manner, in a matter of a few weeks. Needless to say that I was looking forward to this game. I even finished about two thirds of the before I had to abandon it as unplayable and frustrating.First, the pros. This has got to be the most impressive game engine ever. The immensity of this game is huge. It's more like three games combined into one. There are three distinct cities (an LA, San Francisco, and a Las Vegas clone). By far the most expansive game to hit the consoles, ever. It's at least twice as big as Liberty City in GTA 3, but without any of the loading time when traversing the terrain. All the cities capture the unique feel of the city in terms of atmosphere and geography. Just amazing. In fact, that warm glowing feeling I got when I first played the original GTA 3 returned when I played the San Francisco cloned city.The number of missions is impressive as well. It takes about 90 missions to complete the whole storyline. It's a great value.Also worth nothing is the radio. It's got all the rap and rock associated with GTA type destruction from the early nineties. Some include, N.W.A, Easy E, Ice Cube, Public Enemy, Guns N' Roses, Rage Against the Machine, along with some older music, CCR, Skynard, and some R & B like Boys 2 Men and En Vouge. A huge lineup full of famous songs.There are other improvements as well. The motorbikes are more controllable, and the AI of your friends is designed so they don't jump into gunfire or do something else that is incredibly stupid like they did in Vice City.So what's wrong? It all sounds great, right? Nope. Rockstar paid scant attention to gameplay. Sure, when you have over 100 missions total, not everyone can be a winner, but when you're struggling because one out of every 10 missions are long, tedious, or annoying, it just generates a huge headache. A good rule of thumb would be is that 10% of the missions will take about 60% of your time.First off, many missions are multi-part, where if you fail in one part, you got to do the beginning all over again. Now this would be cool if the missions didn't consist of long drives or other such banalities or if this was 1985 and it was the NES, but it's not, and it's unacceptable. They tried to fix this with an option to skip a drive, but it only works in rare instances, and it requires you to drive back after you failed a mission, meaning that you're still driving the same distance. In other words, out of the 61 missions I passed, I was able to use it once.Secondly, there are gimmicks instead of gameplay. What I mean is that they decided to throw everything at you, despite the fact that most of it is unwanted, unneeded, and unintuitive. Now you can swim, cycle, workout, get a girlfriend (no joke), use a camera, etc. Okay, some of these are optional, but many of them are forced upon you in order to advance, and those are annoying and are part of the majority of missions I struggled with. I was waiting for other useless missions like selling girl scout cookies or more idiotic things like that.For example, there is a mission that requires twenty minutes of driving before you can use a camera. The mission and camera are not very well programmed, and the drive is way too long, so it took me about two hours to complete one of the simplest missions of all. I was fuming after this.Now the worst thing are the flying levels. I really have no idea what they were thinking here. The planes are insanely sensitive and uncontrollable. I invested over 30 hours into the game, got two-thirds the way through the game, only to hit the 62nd mission. Now all I had to was pass a few flying lessons. For two hours, I tried to circle an airfield and land - that's' it, and that's only one of the lessons I had to do. I just couldn't do it, and this was one of the first lessons too, which meant that the other ones are probably harder. I just gave up. My time, like yours, is just too valuable battling bad gameplay. This is really frustrating because I have never abandoned a game when I was so far into it. I completed the other GTAs with no cheats or guides, and I've been playing games for 18 years, so it's not like I'm a newbie.No matter how good a game's engine, graphics, voice acting, or music is, gameplay is still king, and Rockstar failed miserably. Sure this will sell 5 million or so copies, but Rockstar pretty much is slowing killing a great franchise.Pros:Huge game with tons of missionsSan Fierro (San Francisco clone) felt just rightGreat graphicsBest gaming engine ever madeImproved AI, controls for bikeUnbelievable musical selectionCons:Flying is beyond terrible - I cannot stress this enoughRepeat the same things in multiple part missions over and over again.Too many unintuitive gimmicks.Cannot skip most missions, so if you're stuck, you're stuckUseless driving.Hours to complete (if you can) - 50 hoursDifficulty level: Medium/HighFrustration level: Very high

The title of this book is very appropriate. Pete Rose seems to think everyone is out to get him, and so his ego is in a prison when someone doesn't agree with him. This book is suppose to convince people that he was mistreated by baseball. However, this had the opposite effect on me. I thought he got a raw deal before reading this book. Now, after reading this, I have to agree with Major League Baseball.First off, the good. It is a very revealing book. It does take guts to write about his life, especially his stint in prison (the one with bars). I found it to be insightful and somewhat interesting. It's definitely a book that anyone can pick up. As a casual read, it's not too bad.Now, if you wanted to learn about Pete Rose and his struggle with MLB, it's entirely different. Throughout this book, he plays the constant victim. He almost seems like he is whining. While he does have some valid points, his constant complaints seem to lesson all degrees of agreeability. The worst is the treatment he talks about when he first deals with MLB. Reading it, it's quite clear that he was in denial about betting on baseball, even until the latter chapters. He describes how the media, and Jim Gray especially, mistreated him by accusing him of betting on baseball. Well, I hate to break it to you Pete, but you did. The media was right.When he does finally admit it, he doesn't describe his actions, but describes how his "disease" forced him into it. Really pathetic. This sort of defeatism perpetuates throughout the book.Even though the book interested me and was very fluid, I was very disappointed with it. I would not recommend this book due to its whining and victimization tilt.

XM AudiovoxSwitching back to SiriusSo, I've had Sirius for 6 months, then gave XM a try. Well, the verdict is in. XM has superior music, but horrible components and customer service.First off, they tried to charge me twice for the XM radio. They setup automatic 3 month renewal, so you have to call them to cancel.The worst part is the receiver. This receiver is horrible. The docking station is so flimsy that it's almost a two hand operation to change the station. You have to wait for a few minutes before all the stations are accessible. The buttons are lousy, and the memory feature does not work. This is just a piece of garbage.This is really weird, because my initial Sirius receiver was also an Audiovox, and it worked really well compared to this excuse.What about the music? Well, it's better. The "Hits" stations are repetitive, but that complements the other stations, which play more obscure bands. Rock is much better here. Hip-hop, however is better with Sirius, though both suffer the same problems like too many D.J. mixes (the reason why I have Satellite is to see the song name, seeing "Mix" is the most useless thing ever).The saving grace is channel 150. The uncensored Comedy station. Though not totally commercial free, it's got to be the best station out there. I would have explored more, but the receiver is so clumsy that I can't do it while driving without risking my life.All in all, Satellite radio is all right. I've moved more towards CDs now, because I just can't find anything to listen to anymore. I'll probably switch to Sirius soon enough, because I find it slightly better overall.Pros:Channel 150 - greatest station everBetter Rock than SiriusCons:Horrible, Horrible receiver (Sirius was great)Dangerous just changing stations (Sirius was great)Terrible customer serviceHip-Hop is worse compared to Sirius

Since I'm starting graduate school, I needed to take a statistics exam in order to avoid taking a statistics prerequisite class. While I used to know much of this information, I completely forgot about eighty percent of it and I pretty much needed to learn from scratch. This book was great.This stats book provides the basics - pretty much everything covered in an introduction to statistics class. The fluidity and ease of explanation makes this a great study book that can be read from front to back.There were a few flaws. I found the beginning to be a little too slow and in depth for such simple concepts. The latter parts tended to blur together so that many of the same concepts seemed like they taught the same thing. I wish there was a wrap up for all the different concepts to make summarization easier. Also, a quick "cheat sheet" of formulas at the end and better some better summaries would have improved this book tremendously.Overall, this is a good book and I recommend it for anyone who needs to brush up or quickly learn statistics.

Sega Sports made a name for itself during the Dreamcast days with NBA2K and NFL2K, thus starting a new franchise that could easily rival EA Sports. NBA2K2 continues this trend with an excellent simulation of basketball. Though much more difficult than NBA2K, it does solve many of the problems, while introducing many new ones.The graphics are great, the physics are spectacular, and the gameplay feels real. Quite possibly the best hoops game ever. Of course that doesn't mean there aren't flaws. Some of things that annoyed me are the lack of offensive rebounds, the complete uselessness of tall man in the lane, and the difficulty of hitting the outside shot. Stephon Marbury easily dunked over Shaq in one game, despite Shaq clearly having position. Also, players tend to stand around, despite calling certain plays. Pick and rolls are difficult to do because your fellow player sometimes won't cooperateAnother thing was the difficulty levels. Easy is too easy, medium starts off too hard, then becomes too easy, and by the time you reach hard, you're sick of re-inventing your game for another difficulty level. They should eliminate easy and add more practice elements, and have only difficulty level, a cross between hard and medium. That way you won't have to adjust your game. For example, on easy, you tend to take more 3 pointers, and let bad shooters on the opposite team take open shots, but in hard, you have to do the exact opposite. It screws you up, especially when playing two players.All that said, this is an excellent game. I played a season with the Lakers, and by the end, I was rolling. The post moves of centers is pretty good, despite the ease of defensive steals. Screens sometimes work, Kobe's got the moves, perimeter defense works well. The player movements are silky smooth, and really look like the actual players. As you played against different teams, you develop different strategies and call different plays to exploit the team's weak points. It's a great game that rewards reflexes and thinking.Overall, it's a great, great basketball and should be bought by any sports game enthusiast.

This books starts off sort of convoluted. I wasn't sure where it was going. Was it a history of wrestling, or about Vince McMahon? Though he throws in some pre 1980 history. It's very incomplete. He tosses in names, some organizations, but does not provide attendance figures or the economics of wrestling, or the amount of fans. It's sort of half completed chronicle that leaves one more confused.The second half is much better. He starts describing the WWF as it turned national, and really concentrated on its war with WCW, politicians, scandals, and its own wrestlers. It includes facts, people, attendance, ratings, and financial information. He vividly paints a picture of Vince McMahon, and his company, that neither bashes him nor glorifies him.He goes into details about wrestlers, about the scandals, about negotiations. He successfully presents the family, the business, the personal, the political, and the economic stories that the WWF produced in the nineties. From a shady hodgepodge of investments, to national prominence, to almost complete destruction, and finally to a billion dollar corporation. He goes into the Monday night Raw - Nitro wars, the story of Hulk Hogan's fall from greatness, the Owen Hart debacle, and the last, controversial WWF match of Brett "The Hitman" Hart.This appears as more of a history book than an opinion about a man. It does not preach or defend, but instead tells interesting tales and presents all the facts. At the end of the book, one could get a complete picture of the WWF. I would highly recommend this book.

Prince of Persia, the Sands of Time was a unique and revolutionary game that relied on intuitive and slow paced gameplay with increased emphasis on thoughts and visuals as opposed to button twitching action. This game, the sequel, moves the game more towards the ordinary action, cliched video game, with increased annoyances from large fights, backtracking, and bosses. Original games shouldn't move back towards the standard, formulaic game, but unfortunately, this does.The first thing everyone is probably wondering is how different is this from the Sands of Time? Well, the puzzles, the intuitive and graceful controls and the fun movements are all there. Many of the same elements of gameplay still exist. Just getting from point A to point B in a large room with pillars, ledges, running on walls, swing on ropes, sliding down drapes, it's all there. Still the same reliance on thinking, visuals. In fact, there is actual improvement. The last game had jumps that were questionable and jumps were made blindly. This game has eliminated much of that. Other improvements include the fact that you traverse the same palace within two different time periods, meaning that the same rooms will have different traps or different lighting. A very interesting and unique concept.The other changes are more dramatic. The videos and styles are a little darker, they've added chase scenes, and most drastic of all, they changed the fighting system and added a lot more fighting.First off, the videos, audio, and visuals of the enemies are of a slightly darker nature, which is pretty much the only reason why it's a mature rating. It's worth noting that they fixed the sound problems from SOT and added subtitles. They changed some of the music. While still ambient, fighting scenes switch to guitar riffs from Godsmack (I think). While I like Godsmack and I own a few albums of theirs, the guitar music is annoying and does not fit well in this game. The story is decent, and CGI is pretty good though. Unfortunately, I have no idea why they made it rated mature. Just removing a few lines, and removing the blood, and making small changes would make this rated T or E. It's pretty pathetic when a video game feels it needs to add sexual connotations and needless blood just to increase sales. All it does is embarrass anyone who sees the game (polygon half-naked woman are just lame) and alienates a large group of players.Secondly, they added more time-based schemes, most notably, chase scenes. Basically, a monster comes in and chases you and you have a limited amount of time to move from one room to another. Now, unfortunately, this does not work. The main reason is that the camera angles switch so often that orienting yourself takes a second, a second you cannot spare. What's worse is that sometimes the cutscenes themselves ruin the momentum and cause you to lose you life. The chase scenes are basically just a sequence of run to room, get caught, start the scene over, run to the next room, get caught, repeat. Just boring, iterative, and badly designed. What's worse is that some controls, noticeably swinging on ropes are poles, are not intuitive when timing is concerned.Thirdly, there are also other cliched things that just annoyed me. Backtracking is slightly annoying, but the lack of balance is huge. The backtracking means that you'll actually go through many of the same rooms a few times. One time I got really lost and had to refer to a walkthrough in order to get my bearings straight. It didn't help that the map is absolutely useless, and it's one big picture with two markers. Not too fun, and a large step backwards in gaming in my opinion. When I say lack of balance, I talk about the distribution of save points and life regeneration points. To reach one point will be dirt easy, then next would require tons of enemies, tons of timed jumps, and a chase scene, which would sometimes takes forever. Also of note is the fact that life upgrades are harder to find. If you want the "good" ending, you've got to get all the life upgrades. This either requires you to get lucky (good luck with that), follow a walkthrough, which isn't fun, or backtrack a lot and do a lot of random searching. Either way, it's boring and I didn't even bother.Fourthly, and most obvious is the "free form fighting system". This is another name for superfluous and unneeded combos. While the first game had enemies that were easy to kill with a few moves, this game is a bit more complicated. It'll take some time to figure out the way to kill an enemy, but once you do, it's pretty much the same repetitive motions over and over again, just more buttons. Unlike the first game, the enemies are not a minor annoyance, but a huge annoyance. There are so many that just to traverse between save points requires you to kill tons of the same enemies for no reason. Many times you can pass by them, but a flaw in the system means that the prince will be in combat mode when an enemy is close by. This means that many of the Prince's moves are not available until you kill the enemies, even though there is no need to kill them in order to move on. Sometimes, especially near the end, enemies just keep coming up. They are relatively easy to kill, but you might mess up once in a while. This is fine, except when there are about twenty enemies to kill, and all it takes is a few snafus ups to die, meaning that killing the enemies is very meticulous, but very, very monotonous. It's just the height of tedium and time wasting. The bosses are also an unneeded clich&eacute;. For example, the last enemy takes almost a half an hour to kill. I encountered a bug when I was about twenty minutes into the last boss, which required me to restart the fight. Talk about boring.Finally, there are some huge glitches. One caused me to lose about twenty minutes or work, and another would have forced me to restart if I didn't keep multiple save games on my memory cards. Two huge bugs discovered in my first try. Talk about a rushed game.All in all, it's a pretty good game, but a little too much like every other game out there. A bad direction for the series, but it still has a bit of the Sands of Time magic to make it very enjoyable.Pros:Incredible atmosphereControls are still pretty intuitive for the puzzlesGreat concept of travelling the same Palace in two different timesGood VideosNo walkthrough or guide needed for most of the gameCons:Repetitive, dull, and an unnecessary large amount of fightingCameras angles still lacking, especially during timed actionUnbalanced gameNeedless backtrackingNeedless Mature rating.Useless MapHuge glitchesGuitar Riffs don't work wellTime to complete: 20 hoursDifficulty level: Medium/Low (on Easy)Frustration level: Medium

This is probably one of the greatest platform games of all time. Of course, that doesn't say much since platform games aren't truly the greatest games. The graphics are very good, though a little garish. The frustration level is not truly a problem. The most important aspect is the openness of such a game. You could move from the level to level with ease. If you're stuck at one place, just move onto a different place. The constraints of a standard platform game are absent.Basically, Jak and Daxter travel through different areas (beaches, volcanoes, caves, villages) and try to pick up power cells. You can gain power cells through accomplishing many different task, from finding certain crates, destroying certain creatures, to mini-games, and on and on. You travel by foot, travel in a sort of hover bike, or in one instance ride a small bird like creature.The controls are pretty intuitive, and the camera angles are right on. You can't save at any point in the game, but the saving takes place in very frequent spots. . This saves the user from repeating many jumps and actions. Sometimes jumping is a little cheap and frustrating, but no one is asking for perfectionThe bad part is that it just is a platform game. Even though the exploration part is nice, it's basically a series of jumps for most of the game. It even falls to the same cliched trap of fighting some super boss at the end.Pros:Good graphicsIntuitiveVery little in terms of cut scenesWide openLittle repetitionCons:Just a platform gameTime: 17 hoursFrustration: LowDifficulty: Low

Jak and Dexter was a darn good platform game. It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable. It was basically a fun all around game. So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse.First off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3. Let me tell you, this does not work. GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment. What does Jak 2 have? It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it. The worst is the movement throughout the city. To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible "hover vehicle" that apparently can't hover beyond "up" or "down". The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety. Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game. I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels.Secondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it "gritty". Oh geez, give me a break. Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty? Why does Jak need to cuss? I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers. The "gritty" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game. Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level.Okay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say? Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again. Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again. Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later. While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad.Finally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass. Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could. This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else. This game pretty much is linear. It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here.So, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas.Pros:Uhmm, I can't think of any.Cons:Pretty much linear.City is mundane.Environments unvaried, stale.Repetitive, tedious levels.Adult for no reason.Hover system is mind boggling bad.Difficulty: MediumFrustration Level: HighHours to complete (my estimate): 25 Hours

First off, the name of the book is misleading. There is no real riddle here. He just explains the origins of the compass, and the slight mystery of whom invented it. Nothing much else about it.He starts off with a bit of history, starting with what was done before the compass was invented. Then he describes how the simple magnet in water was discovered, and how it evolved it what it is today. He goes into the ancient Chinese origins, then the Italian invention and refinement, and then to the Portuguese navigators.Though not a gripping tale, it's basically an interesting history lesson.

Gerber has good concepts. Work on your business, instead of working for your business. Plan and organize as if the business was a franchise prototype, to be run by anyone. He talks about strategies, from organization, to managerial, to systems. He emphasizes long term and precise planning. He emphasizes research and separate task appropriation. All good ideas that should be implemented, but nothing revolutionary or nothing that doesn't include good common sense.However, realizing that he can't sell a pamphlet, he decides to write a book with wishy washy philosophical nonsense accompanied with dialogue between him and a supposed entrepreneurial. Since he uses exact quotes, and the language style of the entrepreneurial is exactly the same as his own, it's got to be fake. Almost insultingly so. I find it hard to believe that he taped and transcribed every meeting with "Sarah", a women who has an amazing knack of asking the most perfect and opportune questions in the same tone and style as the author.The philosophical rants that he goes on is repetitive, dull, and often unnecessary. He just goes on and on. Then the little spiel about how you should use his service in the end makes the book feel cheap and almost like an informercial than a book.Basically, it's all an advertisement to his service. Don't buy this book. It's a rip-off.

Pi is a young Indian boy who boards a ship to Canada, only to be shipwrecked on a boat with a huge Tiger. Hope is gone until he learns that he can tame the tiger and hopefully survive long enough to reach land. Without getting into much detail and spoiling the story, his journey is harrowing, scary, inventive, sometimes disgusting, but thoroughly captivating.This would make it a good book, but the ending provides a fascinating twist that requires the reader to re-think all the events in the novel, making it great. The preface (which I read last, as you should probably do as well), explains how this novel came about which is almost as interesting as the novel itself.All in all, a great, thought provoking, inspiring novel.

Before this game, the Resident Evil series never appealed to me. Static camera angles and clunky controls dominated the early games, and those horrible movies sure didn't endear me to this brand. So Capcom decided to do something about it. They did the only thing that could bring Resident Evil back to the forefront of video games, they created a darn good game.Now the hype makes it seems like the game that can save the Gamecube and redefine gaming forever. Uhh, I don't think so. Not to say that this isn't a great game, but if you're looking for one of those game changing experiences that rarely occurs, like a Grand Theft Auto 3, ICO, or GoldenEye on the N64, it's not going to happen. While this is not a revolutionary game, it's the height of evolutionary gaming. It's probably one of the finest games of the current generation of consoles. The possible game of the year hype is definitely warranted.So, this game is a third person over the shoulder survivor horror action game. This pretty much means that the camera angle is set over the shoulder of the main character, and you fight diseased villagers or monsters in a terrifying environment.In terms of the looks, it's one of the finest games out there. I highly advice an S-video output on your gamecube. However, the screen shots that I often see make this game look a little too good, so if you base your expectations on those screen shots like I did, be prepared to be initially disappointed. The outdoor missions in the beginning will look pixelated and unrefined. Once you hit the castle though, the background graphics are amazing. The atmosphere is dark, and haunting, but the graphics are amazingly smooth. The background is not it though. The main character, the enemies, and the girl you escort around are extremely detailed and the finest I have ever seen. In addition, there are a few cinematics, but they don't overwhelm you or ruin the flow of the game. They integrate well and don't detract from the game.This also brings up sound. This is some of the best use of sound ever. The music builds up tension and at certain points makes you very anxious. The sound is crucial to gameplay, as you need to listen for villagers yelling at each other and listen to the girl you're escorting when she screams for help. The music is ambient, and the sound effects add to the tension and are also useful to the gameplay.Speaking of gameplay; it's excellent. This is more of an action game than a survival horror game, which is good. Unlike the Silent Hill games, this will not bore you to death. You face a lot of enemies and with limited ammo - that is ninety percent of this game - killing enemies. This is not like a first person shooter where one shot kills a whole bunch of people though. You'll have to be creative and think when killing the enemies. If an enemy is carrying dynamite, you can shoot him down after he lights the fuse in order for the dynamite to explode and kill anyone around him. You'll shoot people in the legs in order to slow them down so you don't get overwhelmed. You'll shoot weapons out of enemies hands or in mid air. You'll learn to use the certain weapons when absolutely necessary, and you can upgrade or buy new weapons when needed.Another aspect of the gameplay is the fact that for about one third of the game, you'll escort a girl. I know what you're thinking - an escort mission - no! Well, this is by far the best non playable character AI's ever. She does not jump in front of you when shooting, she doesn't needlessly run into enemies and die, you can heal her, and she tell you when she needs help. This is the finest escort mission around.Finally, this game is really balanced and fair. By exploring every nook and cranny and saving ammo, the latter missions are not annoying like many other games out there. It's pretty well balanced, fun to play, and you were never lost and rarely stuck.Of course, this game is not all rosy. First off, the most apparent thing is that you cannot move your legs and shoot at the same time. You are stationary when shooting. It's very similar to Metroid Prime, which I couldn't get into. I realize that it's sort of a way to maximize graphics by limiting movement, but it's very weird for someone who plays first person shooters on consoles. Fortunately, by the second chapter, I was used to, but it still never felt right.Secondly, this game is more about ammo saving than fighting. While good in some aspects, I was often left wondering if I was wasting of saving ammo, which made me the first half of the game less fun than it should have been.Thirdly, this game is long and tough. Many times you'll enter a room just to see twenty people running at you. You will say "You've got to be kidding me" to yourself a lot. It's about six chapters, but it took me over 30 hours to complete.Fourthly, the stationary shooting, the pixelated outdoor missions, limited ammo, and weak weapons in the beginning made it pretty difficult, boring and frustrating in the beginning. I almost gave up on it. Fortunately I continued to see how good the game was.Finally, there were some minor irritations. Some bosses were hard and I had to look at guides to figure out how to beat them. Also, you cannot save any time you want. While there are many checkpoints, I often killed all the enemies in a room and walked a long way back to a savepoint because there was a significant chance I would die from the next group of enemies. It greatly ruined the flow in the beginning of the game. Also, close action fighting which involved knives, kicks and supplexes were implemented in a weird way that was vastly unintuitive and caused me to lose a lot of health. It's also worth noting that many cutscenes require you to press buttons rapidly or quickly, which is just lame. Lastly, while the game was intense, it wasn't that scary.The one major thing this game was missing was some type of Cooperative mission. This is a game that would be flat out amazing in co-op.So the question is, is it worth buying. Yes? Is it worth buying a gamecube for? Maybe. The gamecube version will most likely look better than the PS2 version, but probably not that much. The main problem is that you'll have to wait a long time for the PS2 version to come out. So, if you've got the money and want to play it right now, then buy Gamecube with Resident Evil.Pros:Great atmosphereSmart AIDetailed EnemiesBest use of soundAddictiveBalancedIntegrated cinematics.Lot of tension.Cons:Limited AmmoNo movement while shootingYou will die a lotCan't save any time you wantKnifing, kicking and supplexing is not intuitiveBosses are a bit toughA little too longNot really scaryNeed to tap buttons during cutscenesNo co-op, multiplayer.Length: 30 hoursDifficulty Level: MediumFrustration Level: Medium

If I didn't have a free rental coupon, I would have never checked this game out. I hated the first game, I didn't care for the first movie, and didn't even bother watching the second movie. I thought this would be another run of the mill disappointing licensed game. Was I wrong or what?It turns out they didn't bother doing a rehash of the old first game. They decided to do it right this time. What they got was an immersive, enjoyable game where web slinging, crime fighting and cut scenes are all woven together nicely.This game takes place in Manhattan, and it's got tons of buildings to swing around, plenty of crime to fight, and plenty of enemies. There are about 15 missions in the story. Most missions consist of swinging to one place, fighting a boss or doing some deed, and earning "hero points", all the while cut scenes keep you informed. Swinging is fun and intuitive. The fights are pretty fun as well. You can dodge, attack, do multiple kicks, jump, etc. The hero points is an interesting, open ended twist. By fighting crime, helping people, battling super villains, or delivering pizza, you can earn enough points to pass a level and buy upgrades. The cut scenes are small and not really impressive, but they add to the game and don't overwhelm it. There is also a lot of humor tossed in for the fun of it.A great point about this game is that you rarely have to repeat anything, and you can save almost at any point. It removes a lot of the frustration.There are some bad points though. Some of the upgrades are super combos where you have to press X, circle, square, look at the sun, twirl on one foot, speak the alphabet backwards in order to do something. Okay, I'm exaggerating, but it's only fun if you like fighting games. Also, the graphics are pretty subpar for a recent PS2 game. With the exception of the buildings, I thought it was pretty lacking. Also, it's linear, which means that you're stuck in one level, you really can't move on. Finally, it gets kind of repetitive. You don't know how sick I was of chasing down car jackers.All in all though, this is quite a solid game which I would recommend to anyone.Pros:Save almost any point.Hardly any replaying.Cut scenes add to the elementFunnyManhattan is enormousIntuitiveCons:Repetitive at some pointsLinearHate the concept of combosGraphics are subparTime to Complete (Story missions only): 10 hoursDifficulty: Low to MediumFrustration: Low to Medium

This game is short and sweet - like Yoda. Not long and annoying - like Jar Jar Binks. I'm not a huge star wars fan, and I've seen Lucas Arts shamelessly spew out terrible games that actually were bought solely on it's connection to Star Wars. Before this game, the only game I thought they made well was Day of the Tentacle, a hilarious PC game from the early 90s.This game is the perfect rental. I don't mean this in a bad way. If the level is set to the easiest level, the game can be completed in a way that is enjoyable and non-frustrating. You can actually play the game without being bogged down in the game. Many hardcore gamers wouldn't care for that, but it suits me just fine. That's why there are difficulty levels. If you feel the need to repeat levels because your ship gone blown up ninety percent of the way - that's fine by me - you've got the option to do it or not.This game is not a complicated, long, immense game. It's simple really. You control a starfighter, and you control it in either first person or behind the starship mode. You shoot, use missiles, and sometimes use the force. The graphics are not superb, the strategy is not really complex, it's basically a shoot-em up.The simplicity is it's major plus. It's fun, that's it. It's not revolutionary, and it doesn't try to be something it's not. The cut scenes aren't spectacular, but then again who cares? You don't need to know special tricks. The last missions are not so much harder than the first missions that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.Since it was Lucas Arts, I expected top-notch graphics. That wasn't the case. The main screen is basically a screen with a little circle in front of it to fire at. The background is decent on the planet, but is just black in space. The ships lack detail, so from a distance, all you see is a circle and some flying specks far away. Not awe inspiring by any means.Pros:Simple.Fun.Difficulty levels settings.Didn't stretch itself too far.Cons:Not revolutionaryGraphics and cut-scenes aren't that good.Basically a screen with a with a little circle to fire intoDifficulty - Easy to Hard (depending on settings)Hours of Play - 5 hours on the easiest levelAnnoyance level - Low

Easterly is an economist who wishes to explain why, despite some massive effort, do some economies grow, and some don't. He delves into what people thought were the magical panacea's to growth, first machine investment, then education, then infrastructure, then aid, then debt relief, and so on. He then refutes each and every one of the suggested solutions.Easterly worked at the World Bank, so he knows what he's talking about. Even though not biting or cynical, he doesn't sugar coat anything. His first few chapters are dry and repetitive in the way that he explains how investing alone will not allow poorer countries to catch up. The following chapters do tend to flow better, though the repetitiveness still remains. It felt like he was switching back and forth, writing to a general audience on some chapters, writing like a educational thesis on a few chapters. Sometimes he'd make a convincing argument to something, but the actual point won't come until much later.Easterly, takes all the myths that most economists believed, and squashes them. Even though he uses anecdotal evidence, he backs up all his points with solid statistics, giving much credibility. It is clearly evident that Easterly has taken fifty years of attempted economic growth incentives, and explained what went wrong in a concise manner.To me, there were some glaring omissions. He never explains why a few countries' economies actually did catch up. He also doesn't bring cultural aspects into the realm. He doesn't refute or accept work ethic differences. Is a country's historical and cultural identity and work ethic influential to it's growth? That is a question that I would have loved to find out.To those who take interest in these types of economic quandaries, this book is right up your alley. Not altogether readable, it is very informative and well researched.

I'll be fair. I loved the first book, House Artriedes, and expected nothing less. However, this book did not meet my expectations.The one main flaw was the structure of this book. Each chapter was about 5 pages long. There were also quite a few sub plots interweaving. For many chapters, it took about 4 pages to get the introduction, then one page of concrete storyline, and then a new chapter started describing a different sub plot. It was hard to get into the rhythm of reading this book when there was no rhythm to begin with. After about twenty pages of this, I start to lose interest. It took me forever to trudge through this book.Another thing was that since each subplot was so spread out, a good chunk of material was wasted repeating the same descriptions over and over again. Though roughly the same size as the House Atriedes, I felt that only about half the action and plot development took place.Finally, it's worth noting that this book is a novel, and not a philosophy lesson like some Dune?s latest books. If you want a good read, with action, great characters, and a moving plot, read the prequels. If you want to continue with the philosophical mutterings of Frank Herbert, don't.

Lahiri is probably one of the best new writers around. Her writing style, both vivid and fluid, can transport a reader to feel another's realm. She makes the most basic elements of life into mesmerizing pieces of literature.This book revolves around the first thirty years of a young Indian growing up in America. A simple novel revolving around him and his immediate family, this book delves both with his family's trials moving to a new country along with a new child discovering the world. Mixed in are tragedies, first loves, ceremonies, and a whole lot more. This book does a remarkable job in what is a book so real that at times it felt that it truly reflected my own life.All in all, a masterful novel.

Prince of Persia is just amazing. Prince of Persia is not a hack and slash game, it's not a fighting game, it's not even really a platform game. The best way to describe it is is as a adventure puzzle game, similar to Ico.Prince of Persia takes place in a huge palace, with many different levels. In fact, there are so many levels, progress is defined by percent, not level number. You control the Prince as he has to traverse the Palace. This palace is magnificent, and the atmosphere of the palace really shines. That alone is worth the price of the game. A lot of thought and artistic integrity was invested in this palace.The Prince has to go through this palace while fighting monsters, which are pretty easy, while jumping, crawling, swinging, or moving objects his way out. That's the beauty of it. The movements to the next levels are the puzzle. It's worth noting that these puzzles are not random, boring search and try puzzle like in Silent Hill or Kings Quest. It's more of, "how can I get to that wall?", or "how can push that button?". The puzzle take thought, but there never random, off the wall puzzles (like spending hours trying to find a key or some other stuff like that).Movement itself is a complete joy. Except for wall to wall jumps, movements don't require exact button pushing mechanics or precision timing. If you're on an overhang, and you need to jump to the next ledge, you just press x, and he'll jump and make it if you're aligned correctly. You can jump from wall to wall, jump up, jump down, run along wall, since, balance, crawl, and hang, and much more. If you do make a mistake, you've got the option of rewinding time, which means that you rarely repeat the same level over and over again. This means that the 12 hours to complete this is about 10 hours of real gameplay. Not like other games where 20 hours of gameplay is really just 5 hours extended over a long period of time through repetitive monsters or jumps, backtracking, or repeating levels.The fights are pretty easy, but they are decent nonetheless. It's good to know that they didn't make it overly hard or pointless.Somethings did bug me. Sometimes the camera angle is not the best. Sometimes you have to guess whether you can actually make a jump or not, or whether a ledge is there, and that could get annoying. Also, one level in particular near the end is very unintuitive. For some reason they take away your time reversal, they made the level really long, and the end of that level was very unintuitive and clumsy. That five minutes of gameplay took an agonizing hour and a half.My other gripe are with the cut-scenes. For some idiotic reason, they decided to make the dialogue volume really low and the background noise extremely high, thus making the vocals unintelligible. I couldn't understand half of what was going on. Worst part is - no subtitles. It's extremely terrible since any major game should catch such a bug, and the fix is really easy. I guess they designed it for televisions with high wattage Dolby surround, as opposed to normal televisions.Pros:No cheats, guides needed - just thought and common senseAtmosphere is amazingIntuitiveTime reverse helps avoid repetitionGreat flowGood balanceImmense palaceCons:Some moves are clumsy - wall to wall jumps for exampleVocals in cut-scenes are way too softDifficulty - EasyFrustration Level - LowTime to Complete: 12 hours

This book is great for its readability. Crichton also is known for his brand of science, making the impossible scientifically plausible. That is what makes the first half of the book great.The second half, however, is just a formulaic middle age adventure. It's pretty boring, and full of holes. Basically, the whole plot is this: A greedy corporation makes a time travel machine, and a professor secretly goes back to the Middle Ages. Once this is found out, the corporation sends a group of graduate students back in time to rescue him. They gain the king's favor, kill a whole bunch of people, and barely make it back in time.Why did they go back to the Middle Ages, when they could have just gone back to the time right before the professor entered the time machine to stop him? I'll never figure it out. How did the graduate students each become super human killing machines? Got me guessing. How can they go back in time, kill and alter so many people, and have the present be the exact same? I wonder how.The second half of the book is an insult to common sense. Heck, time travel ruined the Star Trek movies, the Superman movies, why not ruin Crichton's series of books as well?Basically, a quick, fun read, with a darn stupid plot.

The good thing about this headset is that it works. On it's website, it also has a list of games that it is compatible with. That is smart. I really appreciate that. Also, the cord is 10 feet long.Now to the bad part. This thing is small. How small? It's not big enough for me, and my baseball cap size is 7 1/8, which is probably one of the smallest adult sizes around. Unfortunately, this thing is small. It's adjustable, yes, from unbelievably small to just slightly small. But it's small. If you have a normal size head, I bet this will induce some major headaches. I say avoid it. Another thing is that the microphone length only reaches the middle of your cheek, instead of actually reaching the front of your mouth. Bad design by Logitech.

When I read Fast Food Nation, I thought I could expand my knowledge on why American waistlines are expanding. This small, expensive book provided little new knowledge on this subject.He goes into details that don't really shed much light on the subject. He spends a significant portion of the book describing the origins of High Fructose Corn Syrup. While interesting, the history is pretty much irrelevant now that it's already here. He spends another chunk of this book describing government studies and then criticizing them. Of course, does the American really base their decisions on the studies mentioned - I don't think so.The rest of his depiction of Fat America just concentrates on the supply side of calories. He really doesn't delve into the personal choices that affects one's eating.Basically, this book is small, but that's just means there is really no new information in there. Just read Fast Food Nation, and you'll get a lot more than this.

Counter Hack is a great book overall. It encapsulates all that should be a good technical book. It's easy to read, easy to follow, contains lots of useful information, and doesn't bog down the reader with useless specifications or incredibly obtuse details.From the view of a security newbie, this book provides an all-encompassing view of hacking and counteracting it. The book starts out with a simple introduction to various system and network technologies, and then details the ways to hack into, and then prevent hacking into these technologies. The book takes a great view in each chapter. First it explains the evil hacker's view and how they could exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Then it follows it up with how to shore everything up and prevent such hacking.This book also goes into the tools, websites, and methods to hack and to counter hack, providing an invaluable reference without annoying the reader with too much information. Include this with its remarkable readability, and I would say this should be required reading for anyone administrating networks or writing software applications.In short, I could not imagine a better security book around.

If you were to write a book about a 400 page book on the Riemann Hypothesis, about what page would you describe why that particular problem is important? Page 5, 10? Well, Derbeyshire weaves in and out of tangents and refuses to get to the point until after 320 pages. While it is obvious he knows what he's talking about, the author does not move to a single point.He alternates between the history and the mathematics of the Riemann hypothesis chapter by chapter. The history is fun and interesting, but it was hard to see what he was talking about because he never seemed to explain the title of the book, "Prime obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics". Why is the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics? Why is it called Prime obsession when on the surface it looks the formula has nothing to do with prime numbers? He only tells you near the end, giving no context to most of the book.He utterly fails at the mathematics part. For example, he'll start to get somewhere, but will end up with phrase, "let's first look at...". And he'll explain in annoying detail the most basic, ninth grade mathematics instead of finishing his initial thought. For example, he is about to explain the Zeta function and it seems like he is about to tell you about it, but then suddenly bores you with power rules. You know, the stuff you learned eighth grade. a to X times a to the Y equals a to the (X + Y). He'll bore you with this stuff. This would be fine, if he prefaced every chapter with "if you know this, then skip to...", but he doesn't, so you're stuck sifting through the most basic information to get what you need. Truly annoying.If you do decide to read this (I hope you don't), and have actually completed high school and some college mathematics, then you should skip all odd chapters, with the following exceptions (pages 43-47, 75-81, 100-105, 216-218, 233-237, 302-310, 327-349). There you go, I saved you immense time and effort. Does this mean that nearly half the book is useless? Yes, useless and tedious.

To anyone who has wondered why Oakland GM Billy Beane seems to perform miracles, or more importantly, anyone who truly values statistics and logic over Sportscenter highlights, this book is for you. To anyone who thinks the regular season shows true talent, while the playoffs are a crapshoot, this book is for you.This book chronicles the Oakland A's in three aspects - Billy Beane's own personal history and style, his scientific and more accurate view on recruiting and trading, and the lives of a few A's players themselves. He also delves into the history and explanation of Sabrmatrics, the relatively new and better way of looking at baseball statistics.Billy Beane's philosophy is based on high base percentage, good pitching statistics, and disregards speed, power, arm-strength, or any other characteristic that the typical recruits look for. While other teams only concentrates on potential and tools, Billy exploits this inefficiency and year after years constructs a great baseball team. Instead of game, he approaches it as if it was market, and reacts accordingly. Lewis does a great job expanding on this and paints Billy Beane as a man who can think outside the box.The most intriguing part is when Lewis chronicles the A's draft. He follows them through this ordeal, and details the strategy of drafting and signing those players.After reading this quick book, I can now say I'm Billy Beane fan. I cannot help but respect Billy Beane and the other statisticians that have revolutionized baseball. With all the insight and thought presented, it has helped me appreciate baseball as truly the greatest sport of them all.

The history of salt is a strange book indeed. Can one man really write a book about salt? Well, yes. It does drag on a bit too long for such a small subject. Like most people, I just wanted to satisfy my curiosity on why salt was/is important.It did fulfill my three main goals - be interesting enough to finish, satisfy my curiosity, and tell me a little about history. However, it tends to delve into details that really aren't necessary. I guess the author wanted to capitalize on his former work on Cod, so he invests some time into it. It's a bit Euro-centric, but I will praise the book for devoting quite a few pages to India, China and Africa.All in all, it's a good book. A worldly book that explains the importance and history, from ancient to modern times, of salt. It won't change your life nor will you quick speed through it with zest, but it is very readable and pretty interesting.

First off, I'd like to thank the religious right. If they didn't constantly complain about this game, I would have never heard of it. In fact, I bought a Playstation 2 in order to play this. To say this is a great game would be an understatement. This game definitely belongs in the greatest game of all time lists.Where to start? First off, it's addictive. Very, very addictive. The Surgeon General and FDA better investigate the addictiveness of this game. In its most basic form, you steal cars in order to complete missions. The missions themselves vary widely, from running over someone, stealing the right type of car, rushing to the airport, to assassinating someone. You're not just regulated to cars. Sometimes you have to snipe someone, fire a rocket launcher, or go through a boat chase.The realism, or should I say the general feel, is amazing. You're not handed a car and weapons, but you steal and buy them respectively. How to get money? You could steal a cab and take fares, you could mug random people, or complete missions. You're not just regulated to a straight and narrow road. The whole city is open to you. You actually feel like you're in entire city. As you play longer, you start recognizing streets and neighborhoods. You slowly become acclimated to whole place. Just as if you moved and explored a new city. Some things are just amazing. For example, it takes place in rapid real time. If you have to drive to the other end of the city, it takes three hours in GTA 3 time, and the sunlight adjusts accordingly. That is detail. Another example is the radio. When you steal a car, you actually get to adjust the radio stations. From talk to reggae, it's all there.How real is this game? I played this game for thirty hours on one weekend, and by Monday, it actually effected my ability to drive. I actually had to re-adjust myself to real world driving. That has never, ever happened before.There are also so many things to do. There are about 70 something missions to play, but you only need to complete 50 to win the game. Extra missions are just the tip of the iceberg. You could steal cabs and take fares, steal ambulances and rescue people, take a cop car and go into vigilante mode. You might find yourself just exploring or killing random people for no reason.Finally, there's no really stupid plot. You just meet people, they ask for favors, and then pay you. Simple and straightfoward.Pros:Best Action/Adventure game ever.Open environment.Addictive.Graphics.Radio stations.Missions (Run, stealth, open ended).Not linear - not stuck at one place.Lots of extra stuff.Realistic (sort of).Cons:Mission failed? Got to get briefed again (too long).Too gray, could have used a splash of color.Sometimes forced to drive long distances.Time: 35 hoursDifficulty: MediumFrustration: Low

I figured if this book could be made into a movie, with Hollywood stars and a Hollywood budget, it's got to be good. Add to the fact that it was written by Dave Barry, with a lot of reviews on the cover declaring it to be a great comedy, I thought I might have had a winner.Now I realized why the movie failed. The book wasn't at all funny. If no one said it was a comedy, I would have thought it was a bad action book. I didn't laugh or find anything humorous. The characters are non-engaging, and the story itself was farfetched, but not wacky or fun.The good point about the book is that it's a small, light read. Though not good, it's not annoying, boring, or drawn out.It's basically a series of unrelated characters that converge in an accidental nuclear bomb chase.Though not terrible, it really isn't much.

Everyone raves that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Uhmm, no. This game has great gameplay, but gameplay is only part of the game. The rest is dominated by a horrible movie. When I first popped it in, I was all excited. Trudging through the fake weapons, the plot of characters I could care so little, the tired excuses to show artwork, just zapped all that. The first two hours literally consists of 15 minutes of play. No joke or exaggeration. Of course, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There are so many long drawn out interruptions that it ruined the rhythm of what would have been a good, though not great game.During the few interludes where you can actually play, you get to see a good game. Even though I wish the movements and game was faster, it still combines many elements of platform, adventure, and first person shooter ups. You have to use stealth, accuracy, thought, and quick reflexes to pass this game. The very base of gameplay makes it enjoyableI do have some troubles with the controls. First off, and this is picky, the X button should never, ever, be the abort button when it comes to the front end! Every other game on earth uses it as the enter button to navigate menus, but not this game. There are so many times where I was about to save it, only to be aborted for pressing X. Also, swimming controls are just plain backwards and clumsy. I struggled through the swimming scenes purely because of this. Also, there are other things, like you'd be walking, and all of sudden you'd be flat against a wall just because you turned away from the wall.The general feel I got from the game was that all the effort was made to make it a movie, and then add the game as a side note. There are only two parts, a ship, and a large complex. The ship takes only an hour to finish, and the complex consists of about 10 structures that are pretty much similar. That's it. No complex environment, no contrasting views. Basically, 80 percent of the game play takes place in gray metal rooms.Pros:Great gameplayCombines action, stealth, and puzzlesCons:Awkward controls (x button, swimming)Too many moviesYou will yell "Shut up" many times at your TVLack of variation in environmentsTime: 12 hoursFrustration: High (mostly from the interruptions)

Pablo Escobar, through humble roots, managed to become the most feared and powerful man in Colombia through his notorious drug business. This book documents the efforts of the U.S. and Colombian governments to capture Pablo, and Pablo's efforts to evade and subdue those forces. A truly marvelous book that documents the greatest criminal investigation ever.I would have normally never considered reading a book like this. I tend to find non-fiction dry and uninteresting. This was the exact opposite of what I expected. Written by the same author of Black Hawk Down (which I consider the best war movie ever), he expertly weaves a great tale, dealing with the micro and macro events in this interesting saga.This is a true page-turner and I would highly recommend it to anyone. To further continue raving about the book, I would have to give away details, and that wouldn't do this book any justice.

The graphics are smooth and intense. The controls, even though initially confusing, are pretty good. I've gotten pretty far in this game as well (8 out of 10 levels completed) after playing many, many hours on this game.Sound good, right? Wrong! The difficulty of the Dreamcast version is terrible. I had been in the console/computer game business a while back, and one of the main flaws I noticed is that computer game developers are hardcore gamers, developing games for hardcore gamers. This is a classic example. ...Given enough time, many people could pass this game. However, there are limits. After all, it's just a game, and should only take a maximum 100 hours to complete. This is well beyond the 100 hours.Unless you live and breathe video games and you find ninety-nine percent of all games too easy, stick to another game. I cannot stress this enough! It is nearly impossible to complete for any normal person!
