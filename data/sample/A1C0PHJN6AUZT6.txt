This is a great, unusual movie about 6 women who enjoy all types of adventure trips. Sarah, the main charcter, lost her family in a terrble accident and this is her first trip since.The women are all great, and have real character and background. Just as in reality, there's alot under the surface between these women's relantionship.The go caving, and from there the horror starts. What's real and what isn't gets blurred, and bad secrets get exposed.Somethin starts attacking the women, but I don't want to spoil it for you.The actresses aren't big names yet, but they are all good at acting. The scenery, special effects, etc. pull this togeher an make it possible, which makes it horrifiyin to me.I give this movie an A+

I love this movie! I worked at a video store during college, and I reccomended this to all kinds of people. It was one of the few movies that everyone could find something to laugh at while watching it. Peter is an average Joe who hates almost everything about his average office job. When his hyptomism goes wrong, he stops caring, and surprisingly does better at work. When his two friends are laid off the three hatch a plan to get some money out of the company, but nothing works out as planned.

I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching. Emma is so busy arranging other people's lives that she neglects her own wants and needs. Emma is wealthy and a godd person, but she's not a saint and she doean't come off as one.

This is one movie that I enjoy even more today than I did as a kid. You get to see Shannon Doughtery, Helen Hunt, And Sarah Jessica Parker in the earlier days, dancing in fab 80's outfits to win a spot on DTV! If you are female and haven't seen this , you must!!!

There aren't a lot of movies that you can sit down and enjoy as a family, but this one has something for everyone. It has a lot of laughs, and some small scares, and is really rather entertaining. I recommend this if you're having trouble picking a movie that toddler- grandma can enjoy.

I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then. The neat thing about Little Women is how I connect more with different characters during different points in my life. Romantic Amy, Rebellious Jo, Homemaker Meg, I love them all. This is a definite must read!

Okay, I think a lot more people would love this cheesy 80's horror classic if it had been given another title. Everyone should know by know that this movie has nothing to do with Michael Myers, and why it doesn't. That being said, I love this movie! An alcoholic, womanizing doctor. A man murdered brutally in his hospital. Crazy "robots". Crazy Irishmen. Witches. That annoying commerical! The sppoky music! How anyone who loves cheesy 80's horror doesn't love this movie is beyond me!

So great!I waited 29 long years to see this, my mom would never let me see it, and by the time I grew up, the video stores no longer had it. It actually had a great story, and was pretty gory and filled with nudity, which is what I expected from 80's B horror. I was shocked that the story was so engaging, especially given the subject and genre. You should see this movie, but make sure no kids who believe in Santa accidently see this, it could be scarring.

I love this movie. I was too young too watch it when it was first released, but as soon as I did watch it, I loved it. I also like the movie that inspired this, Play Misty for Me. There were a ton of copycat movies after this, some godd and some really bad. Whether you sympathize with Dan or not, you will be on the edge of your seat during the last half of this movie.

I had seen bit and pieces of this on TV, then its segment on Bravo's scariest movie's TV show.I'm glad I rented it, it was still chilling to this day, maybe for some different reasons, bt it's still a great movie.I can imagine what people thought of it in the 30's, and why they felt it had to be banned.The copy I watched had some audio-visual issues, I think it took place during the transfere, not the filiming.I give this movie a B.

I had forgotten all about this film until I saw its trailer on another movie. It was next on my list, and I'm glad I saw it.I think it fits in with the pyschological/thriller genre, instead of horror. I thought the acting was great, and the story made sense.This is one of those movies that you'll really like, or nor, not much in between.I loved Swank's character, and I would reccommend renting this and giving it a chance.I give it a B.

I agree that this wasn't a movie with a huge message or anything like that, but so what? Can't someone like a movie because they can relax and enjoy the story? If you like movies like that sometimes, try this one. It has a good mix of comedey and drama. I felt terrible for her when she saw her husband on the corner, and I laughed when her mom locked her dad out of the house. It's a good movie to watch when you just want to curl up, relax, and get lost for a couple of hours!

I just saw this movie last night. I know, how much of a loser am I? I was just positive that I wouldn't "get" it because I hadn't read the graphic novels, and didn't really know much about them. When I put it in, I was shocked. It is an awesome movie!! I can see how some people didn't like it, but I wasn't one of them. The sweet digital backgrounds, the casts, the characters, the colors (and lack of)made me love this movie. It's definitly going on my wish list. Just give it a chance, you might love it like I do.

If you liked Saw, I'm willing to bet that you'll like Saw 2 as well. Jigsaw's back, and some questions are answered, while new ones emerge. I think that the premise is very unrealistic compared than the first one, though. 2 guys chained in the bathroom, and people killed one by one in "tests?" Okay, I bought it. A whole bunch of people on a moniter is much harder to believe. But once you get into, it's pretty good. It sets you up for Saw 3, which is a better movie.

Good advice, should've listened to the creepy ghost, Doc. I love this movie and I love the book. I understand that somethings must be changed for the time limit, flow, etc. The scariest parts of the movie for me: Church, the barrier, the path, the actual burial groun, Zelda, Gage(after), the accident, and the moment you realize Louis has lost all sanity. This movie still gives me chills whenever I watch it.

This is one of my all time favorite movies. A rich man is given a gift that changes his life. There are many twists and turns here, but it's one of those movies you can watch again and again. Sure, there are somethings that couldn't happen in real life, but it's a movie! If you haven't seen this, just do yourself a favor and watch it.

I love this movie! However, I also love The Sixth Sense and many of the other movies in this genre. This movie takes an average Chicago family, and puts them into a supernatural situation. The husband's mind is open to spirits, and he and his wife realize that their young son has had this ability long before the husband did. The ghost of a young girl needs his help, and no one can have peace until she gets it!

I picked this book up for free at an orchard, they have a great book give away system. I had heard of this before but never read it. It was okay, but I'm sure I'll never read it again. The story is about 3 sisters and their mom on a ranch is Mexico. The older sister marries the younger one's love, and the story takes off. The problem is, I didn't connect with any of these characters. They story would have grim reality, then fantasy in the next paragraph. I can undrestand why some people would enjoy this, but it's not my thing. I think this is one of those books that you'll love or hate. If you love this book, you'll be shaking your head and wondering what's wrong with me that I didn't like it. If you didn't care for it, you'll understand what I'm saying. Whatever, to each their own.

I loved the Blair Witch Project, and I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed this sequal as well. It didn't try to copy the first movie, and the acting and the atomsphere were spot on. It was really creepy, and I actually had scary nightmares after seeing it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes original and kinda out there horror, and if you hated the first movie, there's still a chance you may like this one.

I first watched this movie at a slumber party in the late 80's. I had forgotten all about it until some recently mentioned it, and I remember how much it scared me as a little girl. I tried to rent it, but no luck. I just bought a used VHS tape on amazon.com, probably for less than the rental would have cost. This movie has great 80's style, and a creepy soundtrack. Tawny Kitean was striking in this movie, which almost made up for the horrible acting. There are ton's of cheesy one liners, and some of the murder scenes are pretty grusome. The ending sucks, but the rest of the movie almost made up for it. If you like 80's horror, and can rent or buy this cheap, why not give it a try?

Like me, do you sometimes finding yourself renting childhood favorites, only to realize after rewatching they they aren't near as good as you remember? This is NOT one of those movies!! The connecting story features a modern Hansel and a pretty evil witch. He reads her stories from a book she gave him to pass the time, to postpone his getting cooked and eaten. Love it! Lot 249 deals with a mummy curse, and three great actors before they hit it big, this is my second fave. The next involves an old man who had ran a drug company who had killed over 5000 cats for testing. The cat kills his whole family except for him, so he hires a professional hit man. Does he get the job done, or do the cat's 9 lives come into play? This is the one I like the least, and it's still pretty good. The third is a tale of a very strange love affair that begins on Halloween, and ends the same night 10 years later. This is the best!If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you have and wonder if it still holds up, buy it!

This is one of thr best teen movies to come out in the 1980's. The characters were well developed and had more than one dimesion. There was good and bad in ALL of the charcters, just like there is in real people. I love how confident Eric is, getting along with Amanda, his best friends, and the toughs he meets. My fave scene in this movie has to be when the tough guys show up to help and the party, and how some of the rich girls liked them. It ended the way I wish it would, although I wonder if the money on those diamonds could have been put to better use, his girl would have loved him anyways. If you haven't seen it, check it out cause it's not a cheesy bubble gum movie. I still love it as an adult.

I thought that this "documentary" sounded great. It's not. Private photos of children's dead bodies, poorly reenacted suicides, and a dry narrator reading old healdlines, made this awful for me. Very broad definiations of insanity, alcholism, and no antibodics is the story here. Which could have been spun in a good but still interesting way, like look how far we've come, instead of taking a small town's troubles and trying to make an X-file like documentery. Bad....

I really love this movie! It gives me a chill every time I watch it, even after all these years. Chucky is a vicious killer, without the sense of humor he displays in the sequals. I feel terrible for the mother and can't imagine what I'd do in her prediciment. This movie is excellent, and if you've watched the comedy/horror sequals first, do yourself a favor and forget them as you turn off the lights and watch Child's Play.

I love these almanacs, I've been buying them every year since 1999. The articles are great and the almanac has enough info and it hard to deicipher, like some are. If you are new to the Craft or have just found these, buy some of the earlier editions as well. You can buy these for little money used on amazon or ebay, and it'll be something that you'll enjoy. It's also a good intro to some Llewellyn authors, if you don't like their articles, you'll know not to buy their books.

I've read and reviewed many of Cunningham's other books, so it was no surprise that I really enjoyed this one as well. It was a great introduction, and really had a great selections of blends. One of the things I love the most and I use the book for the most is the substitution list. Some ingredients are pretty exotic or expensive, it's nice to know that you can use something else and still get desired results.

Maybe I opened this book with too high of expectations. I love the Fear Street series, have since I was a kid. I may have a BA in English, bu I still love to read these during TV comerials and smoke breaks. Anyways, to make a too long story short, I HATED this book. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot left too many gaping holes. Also, while trying to please "adults" Stine left all of his charm on the cutting room floor. I only spent .50 on this at a garage sale, yet I still feel I was ripped off. The only reason I gave this terrible book 2 stars is beacause the idea was original, and I still love the Fear St. books.

This was a favorite movie of mine when I was in middle/high school. I saw it in a bargain bin last Christmas season, and picked it up. It wasn't as thrilling as I remembered, but it was still pretty good. Beautiful, brillant, rich, charming, and a psychopath sets her eyes on the renter of her parents guest home. She's one that never hears the world no. Okay, some of the plot, especially at the end is really far fetched, but besides that, it's a movie I can still enjoy.

I love all types of movie from the horror genere, including camp and B or even C. This being said, this movie still wasn't very good, I did read about it and went in with some expectations. Oops! If they would have cut out the grunting incest caveman guys, it could have worked. Incest is a freaky subject, and the scenes with the normal looking people freaked me out way more than the guys from the Caveman commerical did. Acting was bad, but the setting, and the lake and woods were great. Also, it was shot better than most of the horrorfest movies. I can't reccomend it unless you like the same movies I do, and even then you may be wishing you didn't.

The story and acting were not. There were many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. I understand why some people would like this, but there are many horror film buffs that find this out of place in cannon, and I 'm one of them.

I love horror, and finally saw Hellraiser last night. I had put it off for so many years because I thought it would be more sci-fi than horror, which I don't care for. After watching Bravo's scariest movie moments, I decided to take a chance and rent it. To my total surprise, I loved it! The story line was great, as was the acting, as were the scares. Shame on me for not seeing this years ago. I saw where so many future movies were influenced by this and was amazed. Someday, when someone puts out a list of things you must see to call yourself a fan of the horror genre, this had better on it. Not everyone will like it, but everyone should see it.

This is the one of the many books of the Fear Street series, and it's really good. Fear Street is a series about scary and/or supernatural events that happen to teenagers in a ficitional town called Shadyside. In this book, two best friends find a duffle bag stuffed with thousands of dollars. The friend who comes from a wealthy family wants to turn it in, but her poor friend begs her to bury the money with her and keep it secret until they can spilt it up and share it. One tells her boyfriend, and tricks and twists proceed. This has a pretty good twist ending and gives a good taste of future books in the series.Pulitizer material it's not, but for young teens, or anyone wanting a quick thrilling read, this suits the bill just fine.

This movie still can scare the [....] out of me. The plot, setting, acting, tone, and suspense all work together. Also the music is SOOO creepy! I din't watch this until a few years ago, and it wasn't so dated that I couldn't get into it, which is the case for some older horror movies. It's one of Kevin Bacon's first movies. It's a whodunit kind of horror movie, and I reccomend it highly. If you don't like this, 80's horror probably isn't the genre for you.

I liked this book when I read it before I got pregnant. I had a very difficult first pregnancy, and developed severe pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, and I had to have an emergency c-section at 24 weeks. My son Tyler was born weighing 11oz. and he lived for 5 days. I was racked with as much guilt as grief, I read my books over and over on how I could have done things differently. Turn out I have a gentic blood disorder, and I was able to have a healthy, beautiful baby girl, a year and a half later. I was highly advised that I not get pregnant again, and I agree. I don't write this to scare women, but to let them know that sometimes you can do everything "right" and things just turn out in unexpected ways, and it's out of your control.

I really like this movie, but it's not one that I can watch over and over again, like I can most other movies. There are many plots, subplots, twists and turns, but the story line with Tom Cruise and Juliane Moore was the best. It reduced me to sobs more than once. Everyone should see this movie, but don't be surprised if it's not one you'll be in a hurry to see again.

This is one of my favorite movies, and I rented it on accident. I love eveything about this movie, espcially when she goes to Ireland.The mystery seems pretty straight forward. A best-selling author loses her little boy in a drowing accident, her marriage (he wasn't the boy's father) fell apart, and her best friend found her a nice cottage where she could finish her book and have some time to heal.She meets her neighbor, the lighthouse keeper, and she begins to take down walls, trust, and falls in love with him. Then she goes to he village and is told the lighthousekeeper killed himself 7 years earlier.WHAT?? Is she crazy/delusional, is the small village trying to drive her away, is he a ghost??? The twists are awesome and I reccommend this movie to everyone!!!

Okay, it's not the best horror movie, or werewolf movie, or even in the top 25. I agree that the acting isn't that great, hey I agree with most of the negitive points that other reviewers made about it. However, I still like it, and I watch it when it comes on TV. I guess I'm one of those people who can suspend judgement and get into some movies that don't make sense, and I wonder what that really says about me?

This book is a great resource for moms with kids from babies to age 8 or so. It's chock full of tidbits and ideas to make mothering easier, and our children happier. Yes, I have heard some of the ideas before, and some of sections didn't pertain to my family. There was enough other useful information that made up for that. I also loved the author's style, it felt like reading something a friend who's also a mom wrote. This is a wonderful book with something for everyone!

The tests and death scenes are gruesome, and the characters are more likeable and realistic. There are many twists and turns, and I can't wait to see Saw 4! It'll have to be pretty good to keep up to this movie.

I remember seeing this trailer in the theater, and I remember whispering to my husband that we HAD to see this one. It looked so creepy! Well, it did really poorly at the box office and didn't even get to play at many theaters. Still, I rented it right away when it first came out. Critics and I (and other Amazon reviewers for that matter), don't always see eye to eye. UGH!!! How I wished I would have listened!! This was so bad, so bad in fact I don't even know where to start. The only part I liked was Jon Bon Jovi's looks, ummm...hot for teacher. Not even that could draw me in for a second viewing. Also, the volume in this dvd seemed really screwy. Maybe it was just mine but i had to turn it up super loud and even then it was hard to understand what they were saying at times. Just stay away!!!

If you had HBO in the 1980's, it's alsmost assured that you saw the movie the Gate. I was always excited to see it as a kid, and was pretty happy to find it on DVD. The DVD isn't the best quality, but I didn't expect some 2 disc ultra-edition for an 80's cult classic. I would have bought it, but I'm not sure people seeing it for the first time would take such a chance. There are so many memorable parts in this movie, it's hard to pick out the key scenes. I love the opening, vey eerie, and you're never sure whether it was a dream, real, or somewhere in between. The whole party scene, when Terry falls down the hole, and when the zombie breaks through and carries away his best friend and sister. Oh, and who can forget the rock record taht tells how to close the gate when it's played backward. Oh, sweet memories....

OMG this movie is awful! I love B thrillers and horror, but this one was just beyond terrible. I love Rose, but even she couldn't save this movie. The clothes she wore and the awful one-liners she had to say, yuck! If you are a fan a Rose and feel like you have to see this, rent before you buy, you'll thank me later!

I have to say, I love the Halloween series! This is my favorite sequal. It takes the story ten years into the future, and has plenty of chills, kills, and thrills to go around. Then ending is awesome! Yes it's a sequal, it's not better than the original, but it's still really good!

WARNING!!! Buy this at your own risk! My daughter loves the music in this so much she has to watch it over and over again. It's a wonderful movie, but the magic dimmed some for me after the 300th or so time. However, my girl's still going strong!

I saw this movie when I was 15 or 16, and totally loved it. I loved it so much I went out and bought some books on witchcraft to see what I could do. I was so disapointed that magic didn't work like it did in the movie, and the whole Mano thing was totally fake, plus my parents freaked and made me throw my books out. Flash forward to my freshman year of college, and I became interested in Wicca again, this time for the right, spiritual reasons. I watched this movie again and saw how silly it is and how naivie I was. I have to wonder though, how many people who saw this in the 90's found their way to Wicca through it. When people critize teens now who are interested in the Craft, I wonder where those judgemental people came to Wicca from? I know I can't be the only person who was inspired by this movie as a kid. Oh well...

I've read a few of Clark's other books, and liked them, but I spend most of my time and money on non fiction books. My mom had this and brought it over to me as soon as she finished saying how great it was. She was right, I finished it that night! I felt so bad for her, getting herself stuck into a situation that kept getting worse. I also realy identified with the loss of the baby, because I have lost one too. I will definitly be reading more of her books in the future!

I read this book growing up, and liked it. I reread it as an adult, and I love it. I wish there were more adult thillers on the market today like this. The plot of the book seems simple enough. Two rich sisters invite their senior class to their vacation home in Mexico for a party. Only problem is, when they arrive, the only ones that show were also thos who attended a party where one of the sisters was posioned and sustained serious kidney damaged. What's going on, who did what, who's who, who's to blame? This book answers all those questions and more!

If this movie was a final exam, it would get about a C-. Try as I might, I just couldn't understand why every man in the movie was infatuated by Katie Holmes. The flashback scenes got really old really fast. The one part of the movie I really enjoyed was the party they went to, they got the college party scene down pat. Rent this movie before you buy, for sure.

I first saw this when I was a kid when HBO was playing constantly. I loved it then, and I'm surprised at how much I still enjoy it. Simply told, a poorly treated mother gets to escape for a summer with her boyfriend. She deems her daughter too immature and selfish to run the house, so she hires a baby sitter. Good call, except the old lady dies the first night. The story stays good, and the acting is decent for the kid and adult actors. Give it a try!

I'n not usually into "chick" lit, but this was on sale at Sam's Club so I picked it up. What a gem! It's such a funny book, with characters (even the minor ones) that you feel like you know. Lauren's a wedding planner whose divorced under 30. She's planned all kinds of weddings, but the one she's working on know is by far the most challenging. A rich, obxnious, blonde is marrying a hunky fireman who keeps flirting with Lauren. Add in a monster boss with equally horrid cat, a hippie sister, interesting friends, and a metro-sexual ex. Trust me, you'll be reaching for this one again and again!

This is such an excellent mystery! A woman with a terrible past, and only her husband and one friend know about it. The world thinks she escaped justice when the trial over her 2 murdered kids is thrown out because of mistrial, and a key witness running off. It happened on her birthday. She rebuilt her life, has 2 more little kids, and they go missing. This proves she's a monster, right? Things like this just don't happen twice without direct reason. Did she do it? Is their any chance her children are still alive???? This book has twists, and I was shocked at what really happended and why.

I avoided watching this show for a long time, due to the fact that I'm Wiccan and I don't watch that much TV. Movies, yes, TV, not so much. In fact Gilmore Girls is the only other series I've bought the DVD's for. Anyways, I caught a couple of the early episodes on TNT and really liked them, I thought I'd give season 1 a chance. I'm so glad I did! I really love the sisters and I enjoyed all the things they got themselves into and out of. I don't feel that they belittled Wicca at all, which was my impression before I watched it. They show real Wiccans in a fairly real way, like in the pilot episode and they Friday 13th ones in particular. Anyways, go into in with no preconceptions, and enjoy!

This show was meant to be a dark comedey, but it fell really flat. At first you sympathize with Broderick's character, but any woman who would use her dad to break up with you isn't worth crying over. He goes to NYC to try to win her back, and find she's gotten over him quickly and has a sexy new lover. He meets the new love's ex, Meg Ryan, and the two of them stalk and try to sabotage their ex's new romance in many creepy ways. I found this movie in extremely poor taste, and felt that in the end both Broderick and Ryan were creepy criminals who needed jail time and intense therapy! Once was more than enough, I would never watch it again!

This is such a great feel-good movie! I remember seeing this for the first time when I was a little girl in the 80's. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be when she's leaving the adoption office, and the look on her face when she her's the baby screaming for her. It still melts my heart when she leaves the building with the baby in her arms. She makes sacrifices and mistakes, but ends up a better woman for it.

All right, I don't work in movies or anything like that, I'm a teacher in a small town. That being said, I don't see how this movie got made. They say that it's an "homage" to trashy drive-in movies of the late 60's early 70's. Is this really a genre that was screaming for a modern homage? And what about the target audience? I'm 29 and was born in 1978. The people who saw these type of movies at the drive-in's would have to be how old exactly? If it was a good movie in it's own right, maybe that bit of idiot thinking wouldn't matter. But the movie BLEW!!! There were wpman talking crap for 45 mins as we waited for some action, then BAM, 2 stupid minutes of it. Then, more dead space, and then the only part of the movie I liked, when the table was turned on the guy. If possible, just watch the last couple of scenes on youtube or something and save yourself some time and money. Oh, and i love most of Rodreguz's and Tarantion's other movies. This was just them jerking around and having a studio pay for it.

I really liked this book a lot more than I thought I would. It dealt with value and moral issues that are common in the Pagan community. Yes, sometimes it did seem somewhat preaching, or like it was writen for the "upscale" Pagan, but those moments were few and far between. They really did stress that it's important to be responsible for your choices, which is a huge thing in the Wiccan religion. For instance, if organic tomatoes are too expenseive, what are my alternatives? If I can't grow my own and can't afford the more earth friendly ones, at least i know that I'm responsible for making this decision. It doesn't make me a bad Pagan to know that rent comes before organic veggies, it makes me a realistic and intelligent one!

This movie came out when I was a senior in high school, and it was the theme of our prom that year. I remember that I went to the theater 5 times to see it, plus once more at the drive-in. The scenery, the sets, the lavish costumes, the music, oh the romance! I love this movie from start to finish. That said, it's not a movie for everyone. Most guys I know hate it. I guess it's one of those movies that you either love or hate, and I don't think reading anyone else's review is going to change your mind. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance!

I felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished this book. Yes, some of the material was dated or rather dry, but it is so full of important information that it's one book that every Wiccan should read. These book really explains the diffrent traditions and sects, and gives an honest look at our history. I loved the updated section at the end that listed pagan publications and organizations. This isn't a book for the total newbie, but it can definilty be appreciated from the novice to the high priestess.

She loves the pre and sequals as well. I loved this movie as a girl, and it's one of the few movies that she watches repeatedly that doesn't drive me nuts the 3rd time around.

I was expecting more from this book. Yes, it did contain some great info, but it was so dry and quite frankly, boring at some points, it took forever to get through, and I wouldn't want to read it again. It does have a godd index about gods/goddesses in the back, but this is not for pleasure reading at all. If you enjoy reading manuels and textbooks, you will enjoy it more than I did.

This book is too funny!! I read this gem when I was working at a library a few years back. I bought it when I was pregnant with my daughter, so I could have some of my favorite children's books to read to her in the womb. She's 2 now, and this is her second favorite book of all time, it's right behind The Cat Came Back. I secretly think she likes the cat book better because I usually end up singing it to her. Get this for YOUR child and you won't be diapointed!!

I love this movie! It came as a suprise to me because I'm not normally a big fan of the action genre. The story itself has levels deeper than the special effects and explosions. You care about the characters and what has and will happen in their lives. Okay, completely believeable, not so much, but that's the fun of the action genre!

This was one of the first books I ever read on Wicca, when I was 17, I'm now in my late 20's and have learned much, and have read many other books, but this is always the one I suggest when curious people ask what they should read. Why? Cunningham's style is clear and concise, and has a loving and respectful tone, while not sounding too flowery or preachy. Yes this book leaves things out, but it's a great guide for beginners. Check out his reading list in the back. I've read most of these books and they've been incredibly helpful in my path. I still refer to this book from time to time, and I can't imagine my wiccan bookcase without it.

I liked this movie, so I decided to buy the book. It was even better. The novel felt like a modern Shakespeare tale. The darkness just couldn't be stopped due to the greed of the people involved. The wife, coldly changing and directing from the back reminded me of Lady Macbeth, but in some ways worse. It's a simple story, but that doesn't mean boring, it's one of the best novels I've read in quite awhile.

I'm a pretty big SK fan, but I don't love EVERYTHING he's written. I love this book. The characters seem so real, even background ones, like a janitor or a shop teacher.The plot seems simple, haunted car. That's not it at all. A geeky Arine is riding home with Dennis, his BMOC best friend. He sees a really beat up Plymouth Fury, and it ruins his life as well as many other people's lives, or innocence.I love the whole thing but the scenes that stick are Dennis's conversations with the brother of the man who sold the car.Also, in the very begining, when Arnie and Lebay are settling busniess, the car "comes on" to Dennis in a very creepy way.This novel makes you realize that we don't have near the control over ife that we think we do. When Leigh and Dennis were scared for their famiies, I felt as if my own were in danger.If you haven't read this, pick it up. Yo'll never quite look at old cars the same way again.I give it an A+!

I never forget it, and certain scenes like the cat licking up blood, and that creepy mask, I'll never forget. I'm buying this for my own collection ASAP. If you watch it know, get past the dated stuff and think of how daring it was for it's time, and how creepy it still is.

I was born in 78, so I missed out on some of the good 1970's horror movies. I had read the novel and loved it, and as soon as I signed up for a mail order rental service, it went to the top of the list. I was not disapointed. I thought Katherine Ross was amazing! Yes, the pacing was slow at parts, and it didn't quite portray the growing dread as scary as I had imagined it, but those were my only real issues with it. This is a really frightening movie for me, that these men would be so heartless and selfish and hate their wives so much that they would turn them into "Stepford Wives." Destroying someone you claimed to love so they can cater to you every need and never complain or take time or think for themselves. Wow! That kind of stuff beats most recent horror hands down!

The only reason I rented this movie was because I loved the music on the trailer I watched.Wow. Words really can't describe all the emotions this movie made me feel, ansd I think it may be the only film that has made me feel this way. I loved the story, character, tthe way it was filmed, and oh my god the symbolism! I think that if you had 10 diffrent people sit down at the same time and asked them some questions, you could have ten siffrent opinions, and maybe even what the people thought the movie reprsenrs. This is now one of my favorite films, the greatest part for me is the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, that has entered my soul, and can make me weep. Please, watch this film, and decide for yourself. You may be really glad you did.

A lot of them have terrible difficulty in school, with very low reading levels, and some struggle with lower IQ's. Well the boys read Huck Finn with their teacher, and then watched this movie. You could see the story come alive to them, and see some new connections made. I'm glad this movie is out there and making a diffrence in some many people's lives!

Okay, this was a funny movie that had a great plot and developed characters, but I'll admit that wasn't the thing I love most about this movie. Kate Hudson's character has the best clothes and cutest hair in this movie. She has a zillion costume changes and I looked forward to seeing what she'd wear next. If you're not that into clothes, watch it for its humor and wit.

I have loved this movie the first time I watched it. It's a movie that I can find something different to admire with each viewing. It's so tragic and it didn't happen. I had heard somewhere that this was based lossley on a true story, but I think that's a myth. The belongings left for trash at the end just breaks my heart. You understand, grieve for, and are angry for the parents. As a mother, the only way that I can see their own lives continuning is mental illness that requires them to be committed, serve alcholhics, or turing to suicide themselves.

I was one of those kids whose mom let them watch anything they wanted, and I remember renting this. I remember thinking 70's, eww bad, turn it off, which was a good thing since I was 10 years old. I watched it last week, and it scared me deeply. This is a movie that I doubt I will watch again, but I'm so glad I did see the whole thing once. The violence from both sides was sickening, but the story made it's point. I'm not sure that I agree, being a parent myself, but it did make it. I didn't like the cheesy movies and the way they made the police look like clowns, but those are my only things that I don't "like" about this movie. I put like in quotes because who can really like such brutal rapes and murders?

This has to be one of the funniest 80's teen comedies. A babysitter gets a call from a friend in trouble and she has to go into the city with the kids she's sitting for to pick the friend up. They have tons of hilarious challenges and mishaps along the way. My favorite parts of this movie are when they have to sing at a blues club, and they get stuck between rival gangs in a subway car. If you have never seen this movie or it's been too long, you must watch it right away!

Usually if I watch a movie I don't like, I never watch it again. However, I gave Dark Water a second chance and I'm so glad I did! Dahlia is a woman with problems, and this movie lets you make up your own mind whether they are psychological or paranormal. I personally feel like it was a combination of both. This movie just gets better and better every time I watch it. I truly feel like Jennifer Connelly is this generation's best actress, and I feel she's so underrated.

I learned a lot about the Cathers, Knights Templar, Alchemists, and ritual magic. If you have even a passing interest in witchcraft, you should read this. It's not like reading a novel, or textbook. Maybe a really enjoyable tetbook, it leaves me just wanting to learn more

I can't say how much I love this book! I'm on day 230, and I'm working through this book on my own. This book teaches you so many things and covers so much important material. It sneaks up on you how much you learn. You get to KNOW the Goddess and God in all of their aspects, learn about the elements, learn so much about all of the Sabbats, meditiation, divination, and so much more. Yes, you will need to purchase some simple supplies to make incenses and oils and some of the workings in this book. Guess what? They are relativily inexpensive, and the finished products are totally worth it. I live in the middle of South Dakota, and we have ZERO new age stores in this state. Guess what? I've been able to order everything I need through ebay and at a great store in Colorado that has a website as well as a brick and motar store, plus they take paypal. If you can't afford the ingrediants to make a certain incense, he does suggest simple ones. I'm getting so much out of this book, and I'll be kepping it on my shelf for reference when I'm done with it.

Even though the legend is complete fiction, it scares me, and this video just adds to the scare! Oh and if you hate The Blair Witch Project, skip this because it won't change you opinion of the movie!

I love the Halloween movies. I even love all of the sequals, including number 3, and have written many positive reviews for them. I had been wanting to see this FOREVER, but the video store in my small town doesn't have it. I joined an online rental service and this was the 4th movie that came. I was so disapointed, words can not describe it. I would have turned it off, but I kept hoping it would star to make sense, get scary, etc. Nope, none of these. I would suggest going from 5 right to H2O, because even though H2O is great, it's premise is that 4-6 never happened.

This is the first book I've read by the Frost's, and I really enjoyed it! I didn't feel as if they were knocking other Wiccans' in the least. They clearly state that every Wiccan is different, but this is how they do or see things. I'm a solitary who's not in a coven with no plans to be. This book contained a lot of new perspectives for me. I really enjoyed the history chapter, I'll be doing a lot more research on some of the people and things they wrote about. The big thing i didn't agree with was their theory on crystal wands. But hey, I knew going into it I wasn't going to agree with everything.

The story is so far fetched, but it might have been more believable if it was written from a single point of view, instead of the constant jumping from killer to victim. I also thought the killer's reactions to the main girl in this story was harsh and far fetched. Sure, he was nuts, but I still didn't buy his actions. This was the worst of the books that I've read of hers, unless you are a die-hard fan, stay away from this one. It's not only a waste of money but also of your time.

I love this movie so much! I saw it when I was in high school, and was really surprised at how much I loved it. I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, and at the time Renee was an unknown. Also, I'm not a sporty girl, why would I care about the life of a sport's agent? I don't know if it was the acting, the writing, great casting, wonderful settings, great editing, I just know that it all came together and will become a classic in the future.

I really loved this book! It was the first book that I read about crystal, stone, and metal magic, and it was a great jumping off point. He has some really great tables of correspondance and some interesting folklore and spells. This is not a be all end all kind of book, he states that clearly, many times in the book. Stone and color magic is so subjective and personal, it's one of the harder branches of magic to write about. If you are interested in using stones or crystals, this book is a must buy. I must admit that I am a Cunningham fan and may be a wee-bit biased. :)

This is one of my favorite books in my library. I've given this as gifts many times, mostly to non-pagan but open minded friends. Everyone finds something that they they love about it. This isn't a 101, how-to, Wicca book. This book has ways to charm and improve every room and everyone in your home. It's a really fun, interesting, and inspiring read. I don't usually do spells and tell, but I will say that everything I've tried that this book has suggested has worked. Magical experience all around! I only wish there were more books out there like this one!!

This is the one of the many books of the Fear Street series, and it's really good. Fear Street is a series about scary and/or supernatural events that happen to teenagers in a ficitional town called Shadyside. In this book, best friends Jade and Deena and Deena's half brother Chuck get into ddep trouble making crank calls. The girls got caught by Chuck teasing boys at school, and he calls a random number on Fear Street and gets begged for help by a woman about to be murdered. The characters and plot are better than the average Stine book, and this book has a decent sequal. This has a pretty good twist ending and gives a good taste of future books in the series.Pulitizer material it's not, but for young teens, or anyone wanting a quick thrilling read, this suits the bill just fine.

All the reviewers who said that this is a movie you love or hate,and I really hated it. It was long, boring, and I just didn't connect with any of the characters. I would have turned it off long before it was over, but I was watching it with other people. The only thing remotely good is Camron Diaz, I guess I did like one character after all. Stay away unless you feel you just have to, and if you hate it, you can jump into our ship!

I'm always suprised when I see really great books on the Craft have few reviews compared to a lot of the "junk food" type stuff that is constantly published today. This isn't a how to book for beginners, but a great history that's set up in a dictionary type way. There's so much info and so much to learn here. This isn't just a book for practicing Witches, but for anyone interested in witchcraft. I could see this book being a great resource for anyone doing a paper on witchcraft. It can be a little dry in some spots, but not very many!

I don't know why. I'm not Christian and the series revolves around a minister's wife. Page just creates characters that feel like they are alive, and you want to find out what the're up to. Yes, if I knew of her I'd stay far away because everyone winds up dead at places she goes to, but I love to read about them

I rented this movie and put off watching for awhile, I wasn't even sure if I would make time for it. I;m glad I did!! This movie is dark and disturbing, and it goes through the main poor decisions twice, so the audience can see exactly how a serial killer, hunts and kills. He did open up about his terribly abusive mother, whose memory haunts him and his sister, but I'm not sure if the sister was beaten like the son was. He chooses slim, dark haired women, guess who they look like? Dear old mom. By the way, how did hi mom's life end? When did it? This movie opens with and a shock and ends with one.

I read this book after being fed up with many of the "so-called" eaiser new ones on the market. What a mistake! This book is full of awesome information, has helpful tables, and it puts the history and Kabala info at the back, so you don't have to read a hundred pages beofre you get to the actual card info. It's not perfect, but it's reall close!

I watched this movie as a little girl and really liked it. I remembered that it was a little sad, but I forgot how much as the years went by. i recently bought it for my daughter and decided to watch it again before she did, and I'm glad I did. It's a wonderful movie with a good message, but she's only 2 and I think I won't let her watch this until she's 5 or so. I'll also watch it with her and talk to her about it afterwards.

For me, this wasn't just a book, but a real life changing experience. As a Wiccan, I found this retelling of King Arthur just totally fascinating and absorbing. Bradley literally makes this world come to life around you. I understand that some feel this is an overally feminist novel, but I really didn't feel that way. There are plenty of wonderful male characters in this book. If she doesn't expand upon them as she does the females, it's because this book is from a female point of view. I just adore this book and my only real complaint is that I hadn't read it years earlier.

I've seen 6 of the 8 films to die for, and this was the worst I've seen. It had a chance to be such a good movie, but from the moment the therapist leaves the car, the movie goes downhill fast. Yes, I understood Penny's phobia, but she just carried on and on iin the car for what seemed like forever. Then the random characters they threw in, just to die quickly. And how weird was the killer? I still don't know if it was a man or woman, but I don't really care. This movie sucked, if you feel you have to see it to complete the set, try to watch it for free, and don't be afraid to use the fastforward button at points, I wish I would have.

This is not a great movie. However, if you can put up with some plot holes, cheesy special effects, and way too many "coincedences", then it can be enjoyable to watch. It's kinda campy, but it has a great cast and the first 20 minutes are amazing.

I should have looked at this before I bought it. It's great but I was blown away, it shouldn't have been my first astrology book. I was looking to add astrloogy to my practice and I will slowly. I will come back and review this book again, when I can read it. A warning to beginers, I would choose a simpler starting book.

I had put off watching this movie because it just didn't sound that great to me. Then I watched Bravo's more scary movie momments, and I thought I would get around to it some day. I wish it had been sooner, cause it's great!! Very intense! Now I have to watch Cabin Fever. I think that the plot's original, acting is great, and there was just enough gore without going overboard.

I pledged a sorority by COB in my 2nd semester my freshman year. I looked into a few houses and I really got along with the majority of the women. There was no hazing and I was never humilated in any way. I told myself going in that if there was a lot of negitive behavior, I wasn't going to stand for it. I had lots of independent friends I had met at the dorms and in class, and I was friendly with many of the girls from other sororities. I wanted more time to think about such an important decision, which is why I joined by COB instead of rushing the 1st week of school. I went to the first parties and fell in love with the house I joined but my grandma died during the middle of recruitment and I had to go back home. The girls from my house liked me as well, and I spent a lot of time with them just as an "ordinary" friend the 1st semester before I plegded in Janurary. Anyways, I was very proud of my letters and sisters, and I would be so thrilled if my daughter decides she wants to join. If I had any misgivings, I would never want her to. In the sororities at USD, most girls are given an option of joining one of the 4 houses. They didn't allow photos or videos being taken of the canidates, which was great. I was in a multi-cultural house with Korean, African American, and girls of different ages, backgrounds, and body types. We were considered the "party/fun" house, and there was a "smart/goody-goody" house, "athlete/very fit" house, and the "really rich" house. These were really general stereotypes because I became friends, as did many of my sisters, with girls in all the houses. I did hear of some bad experiences from women in other sororites, but there are 2 sides to every story. There was competition and some sisters did struggle with eating disorders and excessive drinking, but it was just as big of a problem in the dorm I lived in, so it wasn't just a sorority thing. Also, we did more than pay lip service to the service programs were participated in, and I still donate my time and money to them to this day. In conclusion, this book was an interesting read, but I wish the author had focused more on the positive aspects of Greek life to bring a more balanced perception. She also "quoted" my sorority's secret motto but got it wrong. It really irked me because I didn't know if she didn't research or if she did it on purpose to make us look like a less popular house, which just isn't true. After she got that wrong, I seriously started wondering what she got wrong about the other sororities "private" information.

I was really surprised by this movie. I waited to see it until part 3 came out. I just had it in my head that it would be stupid, so I never gave it a chance. I'm so glad I listened to my husband! I watched all three movies in one night and I was hooked! The plot is really difficult to explain without giving anything away, so I won't. I'll just tell you if you're into thrillers, horror, or mysteries, watch SAW!

My daughter loves to watch this on Nic Jr., but she loves the DVD her grandma got her for Christmas. She never gets tired of it, and it sends a pretty postive message and isn't that annoying. It lets me get stuff done around the house and she sings along with them. I just wish wonder pet toys and stuff were available in stores, we'll keep looking for them.

I'm torn when it comes to this movie. I liked the characters, and some of the death scenes were pretty cool. On the other, there are huge plot wholes and it gives a really messed up view of the mental health system. I work with people who have some mental health issues, and it gives them, hospitals, and medications a really bad name. I wouldn't buy this, but it wasn't a waste of time.

I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for ages, so my expectations may had been a bit high. I thought the acting, singing, and atomsphere were great, and it was very unsettling. I hope to get the director's cut, because I know that watching it could turn my like into love. After seeing this movie, I can see why everyone hated the Wickerman remake.

This is the second book that I've read by Ravenwolf, the first was To Ride a Silver Broomstick. I really enjoyed both of them. I guess I can see why many Wiccans would find this too comerical, or that it's written for the wrong audience. However, there is really a lot of great information and ideas in her work. I love the sections on daily devotionals, cauldron magic, and writing your own rituals. If you've read other books by her and didn't like them, it only makes sense not to read any more of them. Also, I've noticed that many of the reviewers who totally bash her seem to have set up accounts simply to do so. I've given many (imo) deserved negitive reviews to plenty of things on Amazon. I think it's really shady that some people only review one or two authors they hate. I would be willing to bet that these reviewers have read one, or less of her books, before they decided to cut and paste their reviwes on all of them.

I read this book as a teenager, and I fell in love with it. Cusick's writing makes you feel as if you're running over the crunchy leaves in the abandoned graveyard with her. I remembered this book as an adult, and finally got my hands on a copy. It was just as chilling as I remembered. I highly reccommend this!

I saw this in the theater when I was in the 3rd grade, and fell in love with the movie. When it came out on video, it was a frequent selection of my little brother and I. As I grew up, the movie slipped my mind, until I realized my hubby had never seen it, and I tried to first rent, then buy a cheap used copy. Impossible!!! It was so frustrating, so it is so great they released this DVD. I rewatched it a few times, and although it wasn't the masterpiece I remember, it has held up pretty well. They jokes were still funny and the monsters scary. My fave character is "scary German guy." I'm on the fence about buying this, now that I've seen it again, I don't know if I would rewatch it much if I bought the DVD. My daughter is only 2 and 1/2 so it would be awhile before she could enjoy it. I guess I won't buy it, but I'm so glad I got to see it again and it got the rerelease it truly deserved. This is a wonderful movie and if you have kids in the 6-12 range, I think they would like it too.

This is a really scary movie, thst's well written, and acted. Although it creates excellent psychological tension, if definitly belongs to the horror genre.I didn't see this movie until I was married, I don't know how I cold have missed it! It takes place in the 90's and I don't feel the movie seems dated, now.A beutiful, intelligent grad student, Helen, is married to a professor, has a wonderfl apartment, sweet best friend and study partner, and is almost finished with her thesis, on Urband Legends. She hears the candyman tale, and investigates, and this is where the horror begins for both Helen and the audience.I would highly reccomend this to anyone who loves horror. Some people back away because, perhaps, they didn't like Helraiser, give this a chance, it's a totally different story.I give it an A.

This has always been one of my fave 80's movies, but I feel it has less to do with true "love", than it does high school culture. It shows the cliques and the bulling and all the real high school garbage in a glossy way. I love the scene he makes in the cafeteria, it always touches me. This is a great show, but it's more about the politics of high school.

I couldn't wait to see this movie, I actually did a happy little dance when I got it from netflix. Hmmmm...I should know by now every time I do this, I end up being disapointed. The plot is very simple, a couple alone in an isolated area get horrifed and then some as strangers in masks toy with them before pouncing. They made it clear there was no movtive.I thought the masks were creepy, the house creepy, and I thought Liz Tyler did a great job. Those were the only things I really liked.I felt the story was drawn out and yet too sparse. These strangers seem to have supernatural speed, and I HATE when someone falls and injures a leg in a movie. I feel it's just a cop out.I read how scary this was on the imbd boards, and I have to strongly disagree. If you want to see it, try waiting for the chep rental deals.

This is NOT a book. It's a flimsy cardboard box and your relatives are supposed to fill out things for you to read at a later date. I should have returned it, I tried selling it for .25 at a garage sale, but ended up dumping it at Goodwill. I'm not saying this is bad for what it is, but read the directions carefully and decide if it's something you want to spend time on.

Just for a little background info on me, I have a BA in English as well as psychology. I worked as a children's library assistant for my first four years out of college. I read this in high school, and reread it years later when I worked at the library. This is such an excellent book for so many reasons. Cooney creates characters so real, you'll never forget them. Hallie/Helen had a lot of problems, but she never took the easy way out. Read this book, especially if you're in high school. I promise that you'll never forget it.

I've read a ton of books on candle rites and spells, and this is my favorite. It has versions for Christians and Pagans. I think it's fasinating and there are rituals in here for many occasions. All of the ones I've tried have worked well for me. Is it magic, or the will of suggestion? I believe in magic, but does it really matter? IT WORKS!!!

I'm from SD, and had never heard about the murders until I rented the movie Bodertown, and I was sucked in. I wanted to read as much as I could, and try to help in any way they need. I'm sorry to say this, but there are news shows that are totally focued on single cases, instead of these mass murders. It horrified me and I wish more was being done for the current workers, and the victims families.

I watched this movie late at night on the IFC a few years ago, and it haunts me still. The abuse of a child lingers on, and it's so evident in this movie. I have a very difficult relantionship with my own father, and found myself moved to tears in this movie. The ending shocked me, and very few movies have the power to do that to me. I highly recommend this film, as long as you understand what you're getting into by watching it.

I loved the first movie, so it isn't a big surprise that I like this one too. The story really had less of a plot, and less likable characters, but the death and gore scenes were amazing and original! When you watch a movie like this, don't forget what genre it is in. If you can suspend your beliefs for 90 minutes, you should buckle up for a good ride.

I didn't think she was half bad in this movie. She seemed realistic to me, who knows what choices we would make in the same situation. It would be really hard to accept that the man you just married was a total freakin lunatic, which he clearly is. I'm not going to give away the total plot, but this movie twists and turns, and it had me on the edge of my seat until the very end.

I really enjoy all of the Halloween movies, even the sequals. This one brought in plenty of perky young teenagers and rookie cops to mutilate. Some of the death scenes are really quite scary, and the actress who plays Jamie, and the dependable Dr. Loomis really carry this moive. I still get chills when I what this in late autumn, alone in the house, jack'o'laterns lit.

This is an excellent book. It is written for people who are new to the world of magic, which the book clearly states. However, I've been involved in Wicca since I was 16, and the book raised some really good points for me. Most people who are new to the craft think that it's all about the spells. I made the same mistake when I started, I think most witches do. But it is about so much more!! If you have been in the craft for many years and have been happy and sucessful in it, I guess this book isn't a must buy. However, I think we all could get something out of it. In my opinion it's not at all "fluffy" to make sure that new witches are very clear about the law of return. It's about making choices and taking responsiblity, which the book does a good job of explaining. If you want to cast a spell on the evil slut who stole your boyfriend, I don't think the 3 days will change your mind. But I wonder how much sucess you'd have at it, since it's so negitive. But if you were clear about what you wanted to do and knew about the consqecuense, well, it's on you. I cast only a few spells a year, most are part of Sabbat rituals. I think that this book makes ethics and vaulues and responsibilty really clear, but the final choices are up to you (and the goddess).

I read this book a few weeks after I lost my newborn son, due to severe pre-eclampsia. Before this happened to me, I didn't even know what pre-e was. It struck fast and I had to have an emergency c-section at 23 weeks into my pregnancy. My son, Tyler Michael, weighed only 11 oz., but he lived for 5 days.This book helped me to deal with my grief in some ways, but for the most part I shoved it all deep down inside, and I just focused on getting pregnant again ASAP. My son died in March of 04 and I was pregnant again by September of the same year. This book got me through the some of the most difficult months in my life. I couldn't bond with my unborn child because I wouldn't allow myself to think about the future. It was truly a day by day ordeal for us. I let me family do the nursey 3 weeks before my scheduled c-section, but no clothes or anything like that. The heartbreak I endured watching Tyler's things being carried out of my home scarred my too deep for that. I read this book constantly. The personal stories from women who had been where I was and got through it was sometimes the only way I could keep under control.My only complaint about this book is that I wish she would have included more info on parenting after a loss. The few things that were included struck a deep cord with me. I held my daughter practically the entire 6 days I was at the hospital, and she slept in a swing in our room until she outgrew it at 9 months. I also am over protective, probably more than I'll admit to. I shoved my grief for Tyler down futher, and it came to a head this past September. "They" say that if you don't grieve, not to worry, it'll wait for you. Indeed it did. The loss of Tyler made it hard to give myself completely to my daughter, so i felt guilt on that on top of everything else. I had major clinical depression and had to be hospitalized for a few days, and was in an intensive outpatient program for 5 weeks after I got released. It changed my life, and I'm feeling more like myself than I have since I got pregant with Tyler. Great doctors, the right medication, and ways to deal with my loss have all improved my life. I'd love it if she worte a book on parenting after a loss, it's harder than people think.I donanated a copy of this to my obgyn, my family doctor, my maternal fetal med doc, and my psychiatrist. I hope that it can help some more of the women who desperatly need it.

Okay, if you are reading this review, you've already seen the movie and you're here to see if people thought this sucked as bad as it did, or for some reason you are considering watching for yourself, thinking that it can't be that bad. IT IS!! I was so excited to see this movie. I love off beat horror films, and I don't have a huge problem if they have some plot holes. After I turned it off, my hubby said, "Well, that was one of the worst shows I've ever seen." Then he got up and moved on to other things. I was so mad and cheated that I actually sat through it again, hoping there was tons of stuff I missed, that it could be this bad. IT IS!! I'm an intelligent person and understood where they were going with the "plot" but wow, I'm a a loss to say how much I really, truly hated this movie.I know sometimes you read reviews where the marjority of people give it 1 star and try to warn you about it. You then want to see it, thinking that nothing could be that horrible. This is!! Please never watch this movie, ever, ever, ever, ever!!!

I know this was made in the early 80's, and I was born in the late 70's. The cold war was pretty much over by the time i was in grade school. I heard good things about this movie over at imdb, and too a chance renting it, and I'm glad I did.The story is pretty straightforward, and it leaves out info like what country did the attack, which would have made no difference to them anywhow. A nice, normal family goes about it's day, Dad heads to the city for work, Mom helps at son's preschool, daughter practices piano, and then the brightest light, a nuclear bomb goes off. They were spared the explosion but not the fall out.As a mother, I found this story so sad and heart wrenching because the things that were killing her family were totally out of her control, and there was no place to go for help. This movie does take a real look at grief, from the teddy bear cene to the birds and the bees scene. With all the threats of terrorism, I think this movie fits quite well with today's society. It made me feel like I had no control over protecting my daughter, and the sad truth is I wouldn't be able to save her. Duck and cover? Get out of here. They just say that so people feel like there's something they can do. I loved this movie, and thought it was very powerful. On the DVD they do interviews with the cast and crew 20 years later, and I enjoyed watching that.I don't think this is a movie I will ever forget, and I'm so glad I watched it. I just hope none of us ever has to live something like it.

I had prety high expectations for this movie because it was voted fan favorite, and I had like the other two films that were released with this. I was a little disapointed. I found the idea original, the scenery very creepy, and the acting pretty good. It just fell apart at the end, it just had way too many plot holes for me to say this movie was more than okay. Which is too bad, because this could have been a great movie that people would remember, rather than a mediocre one that people will soon forget.

I used to rent this movie over and over when I was a girl. It actually inspired me to join girl scouts, and I stay for a few years even though it wasn't as fun as the movie. :) I would love my daughter to see this when she's older, and the humor still stands up today. Any adults looking for an 80's commedy she hasn't seen, this would be a great choice because it's not just for kids!

I put off reading this book because although I heard about how important and influencial it was for Neo-Paganism, there were many complaints about rampant sexism and politics.I wish I had ignored the negitive reviews and read this book much sooner. It was so beautiful and it really inspired me! I can understand how this book started so many covens and brought so many people to the Goddess.Read this book, and read the updated footnotes. Yes, some of her history has been proven untrue, but she owns up to it in the updated edition. If you are a Pagan of any tradition, this is a must read book!!

I think that this book is a very good choice for the begining Wiccan, and I also think that there are some original ideas for more advanced Witches. The book's divided into 4 parts:1. Basic witchery2. Tools of the Trade3. Circle Magic4. CelebrationsPlus a 6 part appendix and a suggested reading list.The tools of the trade section had some great excercies to really connect you with your tools. I enjoyed reading the esbat and sabbatt rituals, and plan to use some of her ideas in the future. This is by no means the only 101 book you should have, but I see nothing wrong with it, and enjoyed it throughly.

This is a great B movie that I can watch again and again! Yes, it's B quality, but in a good way. The plot, characters, acting, sets, costumes, are what makes this movie work. It's a tongue in cheek Greek tradgedy, and should be viewed and enjoyed as such.

I was really loving this movie. I love low budget, independant horror, and the idea seemed pretty original and scary. And it was! 3 old college friends get drunk and end up dancing on some graves after a friend's funeral. Each gets haunted by his/her ow ghost. I thought the acting was good, except for the guy who plays Sid, he sucks. The make-up and effects were so cool until the end. I won't give away the ending but CGI does not work for some movies. This would be one of them. Oh well, I give it a B.

I liked this movie. Yes, there were huge plots holes, some the size of Texas. You have to enjoy this movie for what it is, B horror. I watched all of the 8 films and liked some, hated others. This one has decent acting, and good special effects. Those kids creep me out!! I would suggest you rent this before you buy, people have serious mixed feelings about it. Child zombies, creepy woods, single mom with bratty kids, yeah, I liked it.

This ia a horror movie with holes so wide you could drive a bus through it.-people aren't reported missing-freshmen med students are NEVER called doctor-She really could only find a spare room in the hospital, no apartments open or roomates needed?-Mayans aren't in BRAZIL-why coldn't one person fact check this?Dspite all of this the movie did what it was supposed to, creep me out. The atomshpere was great, and the lead actress and medical teacher performed great.I love low buget horror, but it's not for everyone. If you've watched and enjoyed other movies in this serie, get it righst away. If you don't care for them, this won't change your mind.I give it a B+.

This movie has some of the best acting I've ever seen in a spooky movie, not just by Kidman but by all of the cast. The storyline draws you in and I actually felt as if I were in that dark house with them. I guess many of the twists, I had the 6th Sense figured out right away, but this I wasn't sure of. I love it when a twist works like that!

I decided to buy this book because it was listed in a bibliography in one of my Wicca books. It's not my usual cup of tea, and it sat around awhile before I picked it up. Once I started, I couldn't stop. It was so interesting to get to have peeks into people's private lives. It really helped me to decide what I want to express in my own diary, and what I want to do with them when I die.

This is the one of the many books of the Fear Street series, and it's really good. Fear Street is a series about scary and/or supernatural events that happen to teenagers in a ficitional town called Shadyside. In this book, an attractive actress starts getting threats and terrible accidents and deaths are happening all around her. Who could be doing this? Her new college boyfreiend or her jealous ex? Someone else? This has a pretty good twist ending and gives a good taste of future books in the series.Pulitizer material it's not, but for young teens, or anyone wanting a quick thrilling read, this suits the bill just fine. It's one of the best books in the series!

I really love this book. It explains a lot about Neo-Pagainsm, and goes into some detail about the diffrent traditions and sects. It's not a how to book, and it doesn't try to sneak spells and other things that wouldn't fit into it. It doesn't cover every little thing, but that's not possible. I really enjoyed her tone, and I gave this to my mom to read, so she could understand my religion a little better. I feel that it really helped!

I really enjoyed reading this book. It's not very long, and it's decieivingly simple the first time you read it. But when you read it again, it becomes more and more clear how much modern Wicca is influenced by this work. I'm really surprised how few people have reviewed this book, I truly hope it's not an indicator of how many have actually read it. It's not a 101 book, or even really Wiccan book, but I think that it's essential reading for every Wiccan today, if not pagan.

You also get a taste of many different Llewellyn authors so you can decide who you'd like to read and who you'd rather skip. I keep all of these, and know I always will!

Ok, this movie is not Oscar material. The premise is somewhat far fetched, and I wanted to slap the "nice" husband in this movie so many times it wasn't funny. However, this movie entertained me for the 2 hours it played, and I've watched it more than once. AJ Cook is fantastic and I'd really like to see her in more movies. This movie is a cross between a lifetime original and one of the old "Hitchhiker" episodes. If this is your cup of tea, try this movie. If not, just pass it on by,

I bought this book at the used book store because I'm a fan of Ann Rice's early vampire and Mayfair trilogy books. I had read the first two of the Sleeping Beauty books, and they just weren't for me. Since this was so cheap, I gave it a chance. What a beautiful, off-beat love story! Yes, this is a story about a 16 year old and a forty year old, and if that grosses you out, then this isn't for you. The story takes place in San Fransico and New Orleans, and they are described in a way that makes me feel that I have been there before.

I bought this DVD at Wal-mart for under 5 bucks because it was a double feature with the movie Child's Play, which I love. This DVD also had a disk of special features. I had heard really great things about this movie, so I put it in before Child's Play. I didn't like it. I didn't feel any type of connection with any of the characters, and I found myself lokking forward to seeing them get attacked by the werewolves. That was, until the werewolves appeared on screen. There was some tense build up, the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars. The monsters themselves, hilarious in the worst of ways!! I literally couldn't stop laughing!! And the ending....OMG, that was the funniest thing about the movie. This movie was a joke to me, and one that wasn't funny enough to watch again.

This is the first book I read that was strictly aromoatherapy, I had read bits and pieces about the subject in many books.The authors have a great style, and clear instructions, and some original ideas about how to use aromatherapy: For each section such as: stress relief, yoga, sinus trouble, etc, has different recipies and things to do under each heading. There may be 16 different things you could to get a good sleep, you'll find out fast which methods work best for you.I was pleasantly suprised and greatly happy with the things I've tried. I plan on looking for more books by the Schiller's and I hope they are as good as this.I give the book an A.

I realize that most of the reviewers on amazon hated this movie, and they all have valid reasons for their opinions. However, at the risk of people thinking I have no taste what so ever, I have to admit that I love this movie! I love the scenery, costumes, the sets, acting, storyline, almost everything about it, I really like. I've watched it a bunch of times, and I love it more every time! I will say that I really adore B horror movies that border on camp, and that's how I took this movie. It's a faveorite of mine, which goes to show that sometimes there's no rhyme or reason to people's reactions. You'll hate this movie or love it, there will be no in between. If you hate this movie, like most people seem to, please don't vote against me just because I have a difference of opinion. If you haven't seen it, rent before you buy it.

and the fact that I wasted my time watching this awful excuse for a movie. The plot (if you could call it that) was full of holes, and takes bits and pieces from other bad horror movies. The "acting" was a joke, and had me laughing at times I should have been cringing. The clothes...of I could go on, but take my word for it, this is a D movie, and I have to wonder at the 5 stars, and would bet that they are connected or related to someone who is, to this movie. That's the only logical explaination, please save your money on this one!!!!

This has to be one of Stine's best books. It's a YA book but I think anyone could enjoy this. The plot's simple enough, Jenny gets a new job baby-sitting in a creepy house during a time where baby-sitters are being attacked in her town. She starts getting threatening calls and notes, is she next? You feel as if you know Jenny, and this book has some great twists. This book launched many sequals, some good, others not, but start with the original!

Will everything she sets in motion end up the way she planned? You'll just have to watch and see. Yes, it has some 80's cheese factor, but that's part of why it's so great!

I didn't care for this book when I first read it, mainly because I found it confusing and it was the first one on the subject I read. However, when I read some more basic books, I reread this one. I got a lot more out of it. This isn't a book you skim, do a little breathing, and expect huge change. You use this with other knowledge, and you can have a powerful experience.

If that's enough for you, go ahead and rent it.SPOILER!!! I thought this was a ghost story, not a movie about a schizo child molester/murderer. I want my 2 hours back!

You have the clueless Dad, step-mom who's hot for the teen son, teen son who likes to party with his girlfriend,a whiny ugly little girl who has the evil thing in her room, bitter stepson who is getting nightly visits from his dead dad, and family that just happen to own an occult shop.

I won't get into an intricate plot outline, because other reviewers have done that so well. The things that I love about the movie are: acting, setting, costumes, music, story, and I could go on. Sometimes everything comes together in a movie, and this is one of those. It is a perfect for comparing getting the "curse", something all girls go through, to getting the CURSE, the mark of the beast, which few people have. I love the similarities between the two.

I bought this book as an introducton to runes. It was in many bibliograpies of books I learned from and really enjoyed reading. It doesn't give any symbols or meanings of the runes I had begun working with and that was really surprising, given the title.However, this is a woman who was born to write, as well as cast. To say I enjoyed her style would be an understatement. I feel I learned a lot about preparing to cast, and how to interpret.This book wasn't what I was looking for, but I still found lots of great ideas and info in it.

I'm a huge Stephen King fan!! However, I don't blindly love all of his work. Rose Madder is an excellent story. An abused woman goes on the run from her abusive cop husband. She runs far away and is taken in by an excellent women's shelter, called Daughter's and Sister's. Her husband has gone completely nuts and is hot on her trail. The woman has a new outlook and good new friends, but are they strong enough to go up against a killer with nothing to lose? Add in a magical painting that opens into another world, and boom! Magic!!

I really, really tried to. I just couldn't get into it. The author was kinda preachy for my taste. There was a lot of information on Qabala and mystery schools, which I didn't think went well with a book for begining tarot readers. She doesn't really believe or care that much about card reversals. Is this to save the space or was it too hard to explain to us "dummies"? I read the whole book, but it took forever because I couldn't get into it. I've read many other tarot books, and I would reccommend any of them over this one. If you feel you have to read it, please check it out of the library or borrow from someone else. I found very little useful information here, and all that I did find was available in better books.

I love the Saw movies, so I couldn't wait until this was released. I have watch the other 3 many times, I was so sure I'd love this too. The time frame and traps in the movie were great. I loved the fact that we got to meet Jill and learn more of John's background. However, too many charcters that look the same when they are not covered in blood, made it so hard to figure out who was who and which way was up. I liked the ending because I feel that the last guy standing needs testing because he was the one rigging the traps so they were impossible to win. I'll keep watching until they quit making, but this one wasn't near as good as the 1st 3.

This is such a great organizer! I think it's better for someone who's been subbing for a little while, because it doesn't really tell you how, but it gives you tools to make it eaiser. I made copies of many of the sections, and I find the passes, and the bright ideas, and the list of kids leaving class are something that come in handy. Also it gives activites for those time when you have a few minutes to fill, and this has saved me in every grade I've subbed in. This is worth your money if you plan on subbing for more than a few times.

Everyone told me to start with a simpler beginner deck, but I was really drawn to this one and bought it instead. I'm so glad I listened to my instincts. I have gotten really great results with reading from this deck, and I feel I learned the tarot faster because I felt more connected to it. It has beautiful artwork and vibrant colors, and the pictures tell such wonderful stories. I would reccommend this deck to anyone, including beginners.

I agree with everyone who would love to see the rating system changed so this book could get ZERO stars! It's scary to see all the reviews that give this book a postive report. Did we read the same thing? Can people really be so gullible and closed minded in 2007? I guess this book proves that people can and are. And I have to say that all the reviewers that are recovering "Wiccans" or "Pagans", the religion you were following was called Satanism, which is a totally different thing.

I read a ton of Stine when I was young, and I'm collecting and rereading them now. Some, I can't believe how cheesey they are, and I'm embarrassed to admit I had read it.This book, though, is great. He makes us feel like we really know Scotty, his pressure, the girlfriend since 6th grade, football, going to Princeton, coming from a broken home. Even though he has a date with a girl he didn't know whille Lora was away, it was no big deal and the girl couldn't let go.Stine uses a lot of memorable descriptions here. I hadn't read the book in over 15 years, but I still remember Shannon tossing his hat, and that Lora used coconut shampoo. I have no idea why those images stuck with me, the point is they did, and this is a good story. Maybe not great literature, but fine to curl up with for a short read on a dark night.

I'm such a fan of Harry Potter that it's hard to say why this is my favorite book. I guess because it's so honest, emotional, and it cuts deep. It closes doors while opening even more windows. It is a book that will always stay with you. I almost can't bear to see the movie because there's no way it'll live up to my high expectations.

I love B or even C horror movies, and I've enjoyed most of the after dark films I've see. I will actuaally buy this when it gets under 1.00 on amazon market place. The filming wasn't great, the actors were attractive but only the girl playing Mia did what I would call acting. The setting of the house in the woods is a fave of mine, but the chases through the woods were terrible. I think it had to do with the budget, maybe it would have turned out better if he stalked, not ran throught the trees. I would only reccommend this to people who like B or below horror, and have enjoyed most of the other films to die 4. Otherwise, I can tell you right know that'll you'll hate this!

Okay, I'll be honest, I never wanted to see this movie. I love all the Elm Street movies, and some of the Friday ones, but the whole idea of Freddy and Jason fighting just seemed stupid to me. I caught the end of the movie on TV the other night, and it was pretty good. Turns out my husband has the DVD, so I sat down to watch the whole thing, and it was pretty good. It's not the best of either series, but it's not even close to being the worst.

It's very unusual that I would like a third in the series the best, but I really do! I love the opening amusement park setting, I can always get the creeps there and so many bad things that can happen in one, it makes perfect sense to start a thiller in one. The funny the is, the characters are the least likable ones, not on in the FD series, but in almost any movie. They were just really broad stereotypes of some diffrent teens about to graduate. You know, snotty girls, jocks, emos, etc. I swear you almost cheer for them to get killed, and wow do they get killed in cool and new ways! I really loved the ending, it's how it should be considering the first 2 movies. I also like the interactive features, and some of the stuff on the other disk. If you like these movies for the orignal death scenes, not character development, you'll enjoy this entry.

I rented this, and it's one of my new campy witch movies. I just adore Jennifer Tilly, and totally love her wardrobe in this.This isn't a movie about how sororites or witchraft are, but it's entertaing even so. I think 10 and up could enjoy this, younger kids might not get what's going on.I have to give it an A, forr all of the fun I had while watching and rewatching it.

My mom gave me this book and told me I had to read it. I did, even though it's not a subject I've really been that interested in. Imagine my surprise, I was so engrossed in this book, I finished it in a few days. I found the interaction of kings, queens, mistresses, and everyone else just fascinating and very surprising. I'd reccommend this for someone who doesn't have a huge interest in royal history, it will entertain you just the same.

I bought this book when I started subbing, and it had great info that I wouldn't have thought of, considering my background isn't in education. The classroom management section was to most valuable for me, although I found the whole book useful. I pack this in my sub tote everyday.

Wow, this book totally took me by surprise! The old cliche that you should never judge a book by its cover really hits home here. I was unsure if this was really a book for Witches, and I was pleasantly surprised. The book has great information and spells, and isn't geared to one specific path, so I really think that people with open minds and hearts of any faith could get a lot out of this book.The photographs are beautiful, and timeless. The only thing missing is a guide telling me where I could find some of the beautiful pottery and glassware that are shown throughout the book. I really "connected" with this book, and can't reccommend it enough.

I was so sick of dream dictionarys and books that listed a word, like say elephant, and then a word or two about what that dream means. I heard good things about this author and decided to give it a try. I love it! She lists diffrent types of dreams, and diffrent scenerios in each section. She also gives real life examples and what they meant and how they worked out. De-coding your dreams is a very personal thing, no book can tell you everything. However, it get a little easier to put them in perspective after you read this. I had to buy this new, and it was worth every penny.

Okay, it's better to have your kids read this than not to read at all. That being said, this books are the equivilent of greasy junk food. I enjoyed RL Stine's Fear Street series when I was in junior high, and I even like reading through my old ones even now. But these, are just dummed down versions. Also, who in the world thought these would be apprpropriate for 4-6 year olds is beyond me. There are much better books, even horror/scary books on the market for your kids. Find some of those and don't let them waste their precious time on these.

This is a great season! I'm also slowly working my way through the series, I just started watching reruns of Charmed this year. I loved season 1 and thought this was just as good. My fave episodes are P3 H20, Ex Librius, and Ms. Hellfire. That being said, all of the episodes were pretty great. I felt as if you got to know the sisters more, and their "real" lives were focused on more, or as much as their powers. I think it made the series more enjoyable and acessible for many viewers.

This is the one of the many books of the Fear Street series, and it's really good. Fear Street is a series about scary and/or supernatural events that happen to teenagers in a ficitional town called Shadyside. In this book, a sweet, shy girl who has trouble with boys happens to meet two interesting ones. Too bad one's a deranged killer, the mystery is, which one? This has a pretty good twist ending and gives a good taste of future books in the series.Pulitizer material it's not, but for young teens, or anyone wanting a quick thrilling read, this suits the bill just fine.

Okay, the other reviewers are right, this is a B movie that has some funny parts that were actually meant to be scary. But trust me, if you like "B" thrillers, this one's pretty good. The guy who plays Johnny is spot on, and the little girl is a pretty good actress as well. The plot's interesting but it dies down a little at the end. Oh well, I rented this a lot when I was younger and always enjoyed it. I bought it used off Amazon a while back, and my husband just didn't get why I loved it. Oh well, to each their own.

I recieved this amazing hardcover book from ebay when I bid on an auction for a tarot book. The auction had no picture or title of the book, but it was like .99 including shipping. I'm so happy I took a chance! I liked the diffrent divination meanings, I thought them original, not "strange". I like the ideas for workings, medititations, etc., that are listed for every card. I haven't bought the deck itself yet, but I can't wait until I do!

This is the first Dunwich book I've ever read, and I'm not sure I'll be picking up another one. My main problem with this book is the bibliography. She cites her own works and very few others. Where does she get her info? I have no idea. The spells were silly and a lot of her writing was very fluffy and not that original. Save your money on this one, if you have to spend more than a buck, it's too much!

Wow, this was not a good movie. I expected cheap B horror, but this movie just didn't come through. It was really kind of insulting the way they implied the hideous monters had anything to do with Druidism. The only bright spot was the correct pronoucation of the word Samhian.

Stine is a great YA author, but this book really sucks. He's written so many good books, I feel like this was just a rush job he slipped in and they published it because of who he was. The main character Joanna, is a real snob who treats people really bad. She has a boyfriend and he dies and then it appears he haunting her. I know a lot of his books are far fetched, but this one is way too unbelievable. Also, Joanna is so unlikable that readers will be wishing for her death, not wanting her to solve any mysteries. Don't waste your time or money on this stinker.

It's been a long time since I saw a horror movie that made sense, wasn't slasher or torture focused, and really scared me. This movie really did. I won't rehash the plot, it's already been done. I do think that people who think that Simon was an actual demon (like I do), rather than a psychological state, found this movie scarier, but they still liked it. I watched it with a friend and we came away with totally diffrent conclusions, but we both loved it. Get it today!

Believe it or not, I saw this movie in the theater when I was in the 2nd grade. I just loved it! For years, I asked for a manqein for Christmas for years, on the hopes it would come alive. I never got one. I was a weird kid. Anyways, this is a movie about a window artist who falls in loved with an enchanted manequin who no one else could see as a live person. It is cheesy 80's at it's best. If you haven't seen it, give it a try.

This book is full of adorable children's rooms. What I love most is that you don't have to be rich, or Martha Stewart to use this book. I think it has some wonderful ideas for toddler and preschool rooms, as well as some things that could work anywhere in your home. The design ideas are classic, it won't be out of style next year.

This is one of my all time favorite horror movies. It's so good on so many levels. It's a story that sticks with you long after the movie's over. I love the symbolism of Marty riding the silver bullet before the wolf appears, and then shooting him with a real silver bullet. I really liked the acting of a lot of the townspeople, and the sets looked relastic. It's a movie one could be pulled into time and time again. I know I have!

I was skeptical about buying this book, because the author's book on Celtic magic was awful. I'm so glad I gave it a try. It's mainly a list of what seperate symbols stand for, what certain deities rule, and whole sections on angels and saints. It also has interesting stuff of the history of altars, and how they are used in other cultures. This book would be great for people of many faith, not Pagans.

This was an okay book. I thought this would be more of a decorating and spell book, but I can't call it that. It's just a very gerneral Pagan book that does cover a lot of information that's in many Wiccan or Pagan 101 books already. The Feng Shui system was interesting, but it's in conflict with some other feng shui books, although this was easier to understand and use.I bought this used and while I don't consider it a waste of money, I can't reccommend it to others. Magic House is a great decorating book, and Magical Household by Scott Cunningham is amazing, everone should have copy, it's more lore and spells, everyone can learn from this book. There are many Pagan home books, search and search some more.I give it a C.

First of all, I have to say that this is the first Wiccan cookbook I have ever bought. I hated it. I hated everything about it. The recipies were unusual, but nothing, not even one, that sounded good enough to try cooking. The "magic" included here is suspect at best. I will try another cook book for Wiccan's but not one of hers. The whole tone of the book was actually kinda snotty, not at all like most kitchens witchs are.

Just for a little background info on me, I have a BA in English as well as psychology. I worked as a children's library assistant for my first four years out of college. I remember enjoying some of Cooney's books when I was in middle school. I read this one as an adult, and really enjoyed it. The plot was startingly orignal, in my opinion. I really felt for Mary Lee, and was really invested in what happened to her. Ok, Shakespeare it's not, but if you want to have a fast, thrilling read, try picking it up. If you're not into by chapter 3, just go ahead and put it away.

It's funny, I never watched Charmed until it was canceled, and they started rerunning them on TNT. I got hooked fast and decided to watch season by season. I just finished with the 3rd, and I have to say that I loved it! The sisters get closer, their powers get stronger, and their love lives become much more complicated. My favorite episodes are the ones where Prue has a stalker, and when a little girl needs the sisters help to save a fairy, and of course when Piper and Leo get married. I actually cried when they got married, it was so romantic! If you're a fan of the Charmed Ones, this is a must buy.

Ok, SRW does need to research her history and cite her sources better. But guess what? Many Pagan and Wiccan authors have problems with this due to all the conflicting information that's out there. Starhawk's Spiral Dance is one classic that I also love that has this problem. Does this mean that we should throw all the great stuff here because of some of the mistakes, I wouldn't. This is a Wiccan 101 book, which I read when I was past the 101 stage but curious about this author. I enjoyed her style, I thought she touched on many important subjects, and I learned quite a few new things. It seems that people are so biased against her sucess and a few of her mistakes that they want to discount the good things in her books, and for the Pagan community in general. I liked this book, and would have no problem reccommending it, along with others, to any novice. Oh, and the tone that she uses with Christians or once borns, I took it as her sense of humor, not insults. Oh well, to each their own.

Okay, this book is really dated. She's feminist in the extreme and her views for the future of marriage and sexuality are laughable. Also, she gives tons of information on manipulative magic, and even spells on how to kill people. If she spent any time on ethics, I don't remember it. No Wiccan would perform any of these spells. It will also freak out non Craft friends and family if they pulled it off your shelf and flipped through it. However, she doesn't claim to be Wiccan, and it's just a book of dated spells, not religious philosophy. It was fun and enjoyable to read, and I got a kick out of her writing style. I also found her section on talismans and amulets to be fasinating and correct. I've had great luck with the one I tried. Pick up this book for fun, gleam the useful info out of it, and keep it out of the hands of angry or fearful people.

I almost feel as if I have to apologize for giving this movie 5 stars. Clowns are one of my biggest fears, and when I saw this on the shelf I had to rent it. I loved it! It scared me silly, when so many horror movies recently have barely made me cringe. Yes, it's a B or idependant film, and some of the characters, especially Lynn, I would have like more in depth character development. But come on! This is a crazy clown who stalks and murders with an axe! I bought this movie and have watched it several times, and I can't wait to watch part 2 when it's released.

This is the 3rd book in the baby-sitter series. The first two were fantastic, but this one fell somewhat flat. I can see why this book went the way that it did, but because the readers are so invested in Jenny, it makes the ending a big disapointment. It's still an okay read, and the next sequel gets better. If you liked the first 2 books, you have to read this one, but if you haven't, skip this one and buy the first one!!

I read this book when I was 19, in my first year at college.I loved it so much! Hunter writes like she's really talking to you, sharing her experiences with you. The only part that would make it more accessible to "young witches" would be the high school and college experience stories. The rest of this stuff is great for any Wiccan, male or female, regardless of age. Her chapter on getting to know deity and finding your patron goddess and god is totally intelligent and insipiring. I'm planning on buying her Rites of Pleasure book and hope I love it just as much!

This is a great book, that allows a solitary eclectic take a peek at how more traditional covens are run.The info is helpful, if not figurtivley, then historically. The Rites are designed for covens, but you can adjust them.There's a great section on self-initiation that I wish every pagan could read.They have a very straightforward style, I liked it, but it won't be for everyone's taste.The reading can be a bit dull, or seem dated, but compare this to other bible's, and you'll see how much easier it is to read.If you are serious abot learning witchcraft or wicca, this is a must have. If you aren't sure, just "dabbling", or would only to read sweet fluffy things with no meaning behind them, don't waste you money.I give it an A-.

I had heard so many great things about this book, that I had to buy it. I am Wiccan, but I have never really studied the fairy folk that much. This book was packed with info. In fact, I almost wish I had read some "lesser" works first, so I would have a little better understanding. At some points in the book, I felt a bit lost. Besides this, this is an outstanding book in every way. It's so great to see some books published by someone other than Llywen.

In this book, an attractive wealthy girl named Carter is panicked about failing the math portion of her SAT's. Her dad is a judge, and has big plans for her to go to an Ivy League college. Panicked, pressured, and scared, she gets a boy from the bad side of town who happens to be brilliant in math take the exam for her. However, their original agreement isn't enough, and he keeps blackmailing her for more and more. The reader feels for Carter as she slips deeper and deeper with each lie she tells.

I love this perfume. It has a strong floral scent without being too sweet. I met my husband the night I was wearing this, and it's his favorite scent on me. It's a stronger scent so I wear it when I go out, not to work or run errands. The bottle is also beautiful, and the story on how it's made is charming. This is the scent that I've had the most friends "steal." It irks me somewhat, but I guess the sincerest form of flattery really is imitation.

I started using the 3 step system a few years ago, and the difference in my skin has been amazing. I went from breakout all summer and dry patches in the winter to clear, soft skin. Now people ask me, of all poele, what I use. I tell them to go to the Clinique counter! To be honest, this is the only mosturiser that I've ever used that hasn't caused break outs. I use it every mornings and night, it makes maek-up go on so much easier. Yes, it's expensive, but it lasts a really long time and it WORKS!

I liked this movie almost as much as the first one. The first Hostel left me wondering about this business, how it really works, what kinds of people would pay for this. The sequel shows us the behind the scenes working, from the moment the girls check in, until the newest member is branded. I personaly like all of the girls, except Axelle, obviously. I liked adventuros Whitney, sweet but depressed Lorna, and rich but not at all snobbish, Beth. The movie did make me wonder if Beth was a lesbian, but the fact that it wasn't answered was okay. I did think the kids playing ball at the end was a little too much, but it did make me laugh. If Hostel 3 is released, I'll see it!

This is a book I always reccomend to anyone with a lot of questions about magick, and general interst about the Craft. It answers a lot of questions about what magick is and is not, and what it can and can't do. It explains about diffrent traditions and religions, and gives good life advice for anyone to follow. I've said it beofre and I'll say it again, this is a 101 book and if you have the basics down, you can easily skip this one and not miss that much. However, I think Amber has a great writing style, and although I read this when I was past the 101 pase, I didn't think it was a waste of time.

I'm not a huge fan of SRW, but I do like some of her books, this being one of them. This is a spellbook, it's clearly labled, so I don't get why people would complain about this, if it's not what you are looking for don't BUY it!!! The spells that I've tried, I tweaked a bit to fit me (which I do for any spell written by someone else), and they worked out great. I plan on buying the rest of the series. If you don't like SRW or spellbooks that give clear instructions, don't buy this.

I ordered and studied this book because it was listed as a source in books I had learned so much from. The book doesn't read to "dry", and when it doesn't have the info, it says so and why, like in the Celtic section. If you are interested in the Old Ones, buy this book!

This is the first book of the Fear Street series, and it's really pretty good. Fear Street is a series about scary and/or supernatural events that happen to teenagers in a ficitional town called Shadyside. In this book, an athletic gymnast falls for a new girls in school. She's really cute, and different in an old fashioned kind of way. However, when he tries to find her outside of school, he gets told she doesn't exist. What's going on? Is she a ghost? Is she a liar? This has a pretty good twist ending and gives a good taste of future books in the series. Pulitizer material it's not, but for young teens, or anyone wanting a quick thrilling read, this suits the bill just fine.
