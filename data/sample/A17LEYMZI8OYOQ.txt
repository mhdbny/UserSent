JULIA (1977) is a great movie, beautifully adapted from Lillian Hellman's story by Alvin Sargent, exquisitely directed by Fred Zinnemann and boasting a cast of fine actors, including Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Robards, Hal Holbrook, Rosemary Murphy, Maximilian Schell and, in her film debut, Meryl Streep.The film earned eleven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Redgrave, Robards and Sargent won their statuettes.Fonda plays Hellman, who in the early 1930s was an angry, struggling wannabe playwright, living with mystery writer Dashiell Hammett (Robards). With success still eluding her, she travels to Europe, hoping to find a better atmosphere in which to write, and also to visit with her oldest and dearest friend, Julia (Redgrave), daughter of a very wealthy family who is studying medicine in Vienna.Julia is also involved in an anti-Fascist/anti-Nazi movement, which has resulted in her being badly injured. In fact, after Hellman visits her in the hospital, she disappears. Years later, after she has become a Broadway success, Lillian is asked by Julia, via a political acquaintance (Schell), to undertake a dangerous clandestine mission against the Nazis.Though much of it may be fiction, JULIA is a gripping, moving, often suspenseful drama that stays with viewers long after it has ended. It's one of this writer's very favorite films.Michael B. Druxman

PRIME is an irresistible, often hilarious romantic comedy. The characters and the issues involved are real, and the film has an honest ending; the right ending. I loved this movie.Uma Thurman stars as a 37-year-old divorcee who falls for a 23-year old struggling, albeit talented, painter (Bryan Greenberg). Her shrink (Meryl Streep) initially approves of the relationship, because she thinks it will help her patient get out of her post-divorce funk.However, after a couple of weeks, Streep realizes that the new man in Uma's life is, in fact, her own son.Now, what does she do? Drop Uma as a patient...or continue to treat her?One thing that she does not want is for Bryan to be involved with Uma. As Meryl sees it, the age difference is not the only problem with the relationship. She's also concerned that Uma is not Jewish.There are some very funny scenes in this picture, such as the therapy sessions in which Uma describes to Meryl, in graphic detail, her sex life with her new boy friend. Mother Meryl's subdued reactions are priceless.Ben Younger wrote and directed this delightful film, which co-stars Jon Abrahams as Bryan's buddy who breaks-up with his girl friends in a very unique manner.DVD extras include deleted scenes and bloopers.Michael B. Druxman

ALL THE KING'S MEN (1949) is certainly one of the best movies about American politics ever produced. Adapted by director Robert Rossen from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which was inspired by the career of Louisiana's demagogue governor, Huey Long, it won Oscars for Best Picture, Actor (Broderick Crawford) and Supporting Actress (Mercedes McCambridge).When I first heard that Columbia Pictures was going to remake this classic film, I thought they were nuts. After all, no matter how good the new version might be, it would always be competing with the memory of the original which is shown regularly on TV and is also available on DVD.Despite a stellar all-star cast and a handsome production, the 2006 remake of ALL THE KING'S MEN was met with a mixed, often negative, critical reaction and flopped at the box-office.Nevertheless, I wanted to judge this film for myself.The good news is that writer-director Steven Zaillian's film is not the total disaster that some critics have labeled it. It has many strong points and is definitely worth a look.The bad news is that it is not as good as the original 1949 version.The 1949 film was neither time, nor place, specific, but this new version does an excellent job in recreating Depression-era Louisiana. It is also closer to Warren's original book than was Rossen's screenplay.Among the more memorable performances are Jude Law, as Jack Burden, the role originated by John Ireland in 1949, Patricia Clarkson as Sadie Burke (the Mercedes McCambridge role) and Jackie Earle Haley as Sugar Boy, Governor Willie Stark's bodyguard.Aside from a sometimes sluggish pace, the movie's main failing is the miss-casting of Sean Penn in the central role of Willie Stark.Penn is one of our finest actors and he does his best in this assignment, but he, unfortunately, lacks the charisma that Crawford brought to the role in the original.Penn's Willie is just not likable, and I don't see how he could convince his constituents to vote for him.Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Kathy Baker and Mark Ruffalo are also in the cast.Michael B.

Co-written by Delmer Daves (with Robert Townsend) and directed by Robert Webb, WHITE FEATHER (1955) is essentially a true story with a plot similar to BROKEN ARROW. In fact, it co-stars Debra Paget who also played the hero's Native American love interest in BROKEN ARROW.Robert Wagner stars as Josh Tanner, a surveyor, sent to Fort Laramie to lay out a townsite, once a treaty has been signed with the Cheyenne. After a couple of tense encounters, he becomes friends with Little Dog (Jeffrey Hunter), son of Chief Broken Hand (Eduard Franz), and American Horse (Hugh O'Brian), both of whom oppose any treaty with the whites. He also falls in love with Appearing Day (Paget), who has been promised to American Horse.Once Broken Hand signs the treaty, both Little Dog and American Horse send a white feather to the military commander (John Lund) of the fort, challenging him to war. It will be the two Cheyenne against the entire Army force, but if the military fires first, the entire tribe of Cheyenne may turn of them.According to the film, the son of the characters played by Wagner and Paget (i.e. Chief Broken Hand's grandson) would attend the military academy at West Point.Noah Beery, Jr. and Virginia Leith co-star in the movie.Michael B.

Helen Hunt makes her film directing debut in this heartwarming, funny dramedy in which she plays a childless 39-year-old teacher, who is on a major losing streak. Within days of each other, her immature husband (Matthew Broderick) leaves her, her adoptive mother dies and, out of the blue, her birth mother (Bette Midler) suddenly appears and turns out to be a world-class liar.The one positive thing in her life is divorced father Colin Firth, with whom she makes an immediate love connection, but then she discovers she's pregnant by Broderick.This is one of the best (little known) movies I saw last year.Michael B.

This is the best "date movie" that I've seen in some time.Sanaa Lathan stars as a staid, albeit successful, African-American businesswoman, about to make partner in a major corporation. All is going well in her life until she meets and, ultimately, falls for Simon Baker, a laid back landscape architect...who just happens to be white.Will Sanaa acquiesce to her deep-seated racial prejudice, or will she follow her heart?The ending of Kriss Turner's intelligent and witty script may be a foregone conclusion, but that really makes no difference because the characters are very likable and the situation is quite believable.Sanaa Hamri directed the romantic comedy, which co-stars Mike Epps, Blair Underwood and Alfre Woodard.Michael B.

Although it has never gained the stature of classics like HIGH NOON or THE SEARCHERS, THE BIG COUNTRY (1958) must be counted as one of the "great" westerns.William Wyler directed the sweeping drama, adapted from Donald Hamilton's novel, that is filled with rousing action, compelling, multi-layered characters, splendid cinematography and a magnificent music score by Jerome Moross.Gregory Peck stars as a sea captain who comes West to marry Carroll Baker, daughter of cattle baron Charles Bickford. Almost immediately, he reluctantly finds himself caught up in a vicious range war between his future father-in-law and Burl Ives, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance.Other key characters include Charlton Heston as Bickford's foreman and Baker's former lover who continually cast aspersions at Peck's manhood. This results in one of the most interestingly staged fistfights in film history.Also present are Jean Simmons, cast as Baker's friend and the owner of a piece of land that both Bickford and Ives want to secure, and Chuck Connors, as Ives' abhorrent son, who is smitten with Ms. Simmons.THE BIG COUNTRY is a film that I can't recommend too highly to both western buffs and anybody else who just likes a good movie.Michael B.

John Singleton directed this very well done action drama that plays like a modern day version of the old John Wayne western, THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER.When their adopted mother is shot down, ostensibly by two gang members in a convenience store robbery, her four sons return to their Detroit home to attend her funeral and to also see that the killers are brought to justice.None of these men (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund) would qualify as "citizen of the year," and, in fact, some of them have had their own problems with the law.It doesn't take long for the brothers to discover that Mom was not the victim of a simple hold-up, but was the target of a assassination plot. Now, the quartet has to discover who put out the "contract," and for what reason. Their heavy-handed investigation turns up the name of a local drug lord, and also exposes some police corruption.There are some terrific action sequences in this film, particularly a fantastic shootout at the mother's home that leaves a street filled with dead bodies.Terrence Howard co-stars as an honest cop.DVD extras include director commentary, deleted scenes and several "Making of" featurettes. One of them shows how the aforementioned shootout was staged.Michael B. Druxman

In THE FIVE PENNIES (1959), funnyman Danny Kaye takes on the real-life role of jazz legend Loring "Red" Nichols, considered to be one of the greatest horn players of his day. Dorsey, Miller, Shaw and other major band leaders got their starts with him.Nichols himself plays the horn for Kaye off-camera, but Danny has plenty of opportunities to clown and make his own unique kind of music on-screen. Indeed, a duet of "When the Saints Go Marching In" with the incomparable Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong is one of the film's highlights.There is, however, a serious side to Nichols' story. In the late 1930s, while his band was playing date-after-date on the road, his young daughter came down with polio. As a result, he decided to quit the music business, going to work in a defense plant and spending more time with his family. He not make a comeback until after World War II.Melville Shavelson directed this touching, entertaining biography, which co-stars Barbara Bel Geddes, Harry Guardino, Tuesday Weld, Bob Crosby and Bobby Troup.Michael B.

Most of the reviews I've read on RIGHTEOUS KILL, available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, have not been very positive, but I think that this picture has gotten a raw deal.The problem, as I see it, is one of "expectations". If Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are co-starring in a motion picture, one expects something of the caliber of THE GODFATHER, Part II, or at the very least, HEAT.Unfortunately, RIGHTEOUS KILL is not in the same league as either of those films, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing.Directed by Jon Avnet, RIGHTEOUS KILL is a taut, very watchable cops-and-robbers thriller. It has the two stars playing NYPD detectives on the trail of a serial killer who is probably a fellow police officer turned vigilante. He is killing violent bad guys who have been able to escape the justice system. Although the movie opens with DeNiro "confessing" to the killings, there is a twist ending that astute viewers will probably guess long before it is revealed on screen.The script by Russell Gewietz is well-written, and the actors, including John Leguizamo, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Donnie Wahlberg, Melissa Leo and Curtis Jackson, deliver strong performances.Avnet delivers audio commentary on the DVD, and there are two "Making of" featurettes.Michael B.

Along with Ethel Merman and Mary Martin, Gwen Verdon was one of the great stars of the American Musical Theatre, and like those other legendary ladies, she seldom got the chance to strut her stuff when her Broadway hits were turned into movies.The one exception was her breakout role in the fabulous musical-comedy DAMN YANKEES!Along with fellow Tony winner Ray Walston and the rest of the original Broadway cast (with one key exception), Gwen went to Hollywood to recreate her role as the vampy Lola for the 1958 movie, directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen and choreographed by Bob Fosse.DAMN YANKEES! is the Faust legend transferred to a baseball setting. An aging Washington Senators fan sells his soul to the Devil (Walston) in order to play for his team. Turned into a 22-year-old (a poorly cast Tab Hunter), the "old guy" becomes the star player and, but then the Devil enlists the services of Lola to keep him in line.Verdon is nothing short of terrific. She steals the film."Heart," "Who's Got the Pain?" and "Whatever Lola Wants" are among the show's memorable songs.Michael B. Druxman

One of my favorite movies of 2008 was IN BRUGES, a quirky action/comedy about a pair of hit men, written and directed by Martin McDonagh and starring Brendan Gleeson.Now, McDonagh's brother, John Michael McDonagh, has written and directed THE GUARD, also starring Gleeson and also an action comedy with a like eccentric sense of humor.Gleeson plays a blunt, individualist police sergeant in a small town on the west coast of Ireland, who finds himself out of his depth when faced with solving both a murder and the disappearance of one of his officers. At the same time, he must deal with an FBI agent (Don Cheadle), who has come to the Emerald Isle to intercept a major shipment from an international band of drug smugglers.It's no secret that Gleeson and Cheadle are looking for the same people, but the pair are at loggerheads from the start and much of this movie's fun comes from their outrageous banter, and the fact that, on the surface, the small town cop refuses to cooperate with the Yank's investigation. This forces Cheadle to do his own detective work, not an easy task for a black man wearing a suit in rural Ireland where most people insist in speaking Gaelic.Nothing is quite what it seems in this witty film, nor do the plot twists turn in the direction that one would expect. The cast, which includes Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham and Fionnula Flanagan, is excellent, though, at times, it is not easy to understand their Irish accents.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has many extras, including audio commentary by McDonagh, Gleeson, and Cheadle, deleted and extended scenes, outtakes, a "Making of" featurette, a short early film by McDonagh and a Q&A; session with the director and two stars at the L.A. Film Festival.If you liked IN BRUGES, then you will definitely enjoy THE GUARD.Michael B. Druxman

PATHS OF GLORY (1957) is, arguably, the finest anti-war movie ever made.It is also one of the most depressing (and anti-French) war movies ever made.Kirk Douglas stars as a French Army officer in the WW1 drama, serving under General George Macready, who, when a suicide mission he has ordered fails, demands that three soldiers be chosen at random and tried for cowardice. Appalled at that turn of events, Douglas decides to defend the three doomed men in a court-martial whose outcome has already been decided.PATHS OF GLORY, adapted from a novel based on fact by Humphrey Cobb, is a stunning black-and-white film that seems to become even more meaningful as time goes by. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it co-stars Adolphe Menjou, Ralph Meeker and Wayne Morris.This new restored edition from The Criterion Collection features a wealth of extras, including audio commentary by critic Gary Giddins, an excerpt from a 1966 audio interview by Kubrick, a 1979 television interview with Douglas, a French television piece about the actual incident that inspired the book, plus new interviews with Kubrick associates Jan Harlan, James B. Harris and widow Christiane Kubrick. Additionally, the set has a booklet containing an essay by film scholar James Naremore.Muchael B. Druxman

Fans of Stanley Kibrick will be delighted to find that The Criterion Collection has now remastered and combined a pair of the director's earliest films in a new 2-disc DVD release.Reminiscent, in part, of THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (1950), perhaps because both films had the same star (i.e. Sterling Hayden), THE KILLING (1956) is a slick caper movie about a racetrack robbery and the double-crosses that follow.Jay C. Flippen, Elisha Cook, Jr., Joe Sawyer, Timothy Carey, Ted de Corsica, Vince Edwards and Marie Windsor are among the colorful group of shady characters who make this film one of the most memorable of the genre. In fact, many of these reliable character actors, Cook and Sawyer in particular, get the opportunity to play the most in-depth roles of their film careers in the semi-documentary crime drama, which moves back-and-forth in time.KILLER'S KISS (1955) is a shoddy film, interesting mainly because Kubrick directed it, and that it proves you can produce (and sell) a movie made on an ultra-low budget. The somewhat confusing melodrama has to do with a boxer, a singer and her nasty boss. Jamie Smith, Irene Kane and Frank Silvera play the leading roles.This DVD set has some excellent extras, chiefly a fascinating vintage interview with Sterling Hayden and a very informative recent interview with James B. Harris, who produced The Killing and other Kubrick pictures.Other new interviews are with author Robert Polito, talking about Jim Thompson, who co-wrote THE KILLING, and film critic Geoffrey O'Brien discussing KILLER'S KISS. Finally, the set has an essay booklet that includes a re-printed interview with Marie Windsor.Michael B. Druxman

Who killed Superman?The LAPD, back in 1957, claimed that actor George Reeves, who played the superhero on television for many years, committed suicide, but other people have speculated that it was either his fiance', or even a professional "hit," ordered by MGM executive Eddie Mannix, whose wife, Toni, had had a long-term affair with Reeves.This handsomely-filmed crime thriller, which does an excellent job of recreating Hollywood of that golden era, reexamines the case from the point-of-view of a sleazy, fictional detective, played by Adrien Brody. His life seems to parallel that of Reeves', as he is hired by the dead actor's mother (Lois Smith) to investigate the case.During his travels, Brody uncovers the relationship between second-rate actor Reeves (Ben Affleck in a performance that deserved an Oscar nomination), and the much older Toni Mannix (Diane Lane). He also encounters the power of the studios and their ability to arrange a cover-up of what really happened to Reeves.Bob Hoskins as Eddie Mannix, Robin Tunney as Reeves' fiance' and Joe Spano as MGM publicity head Howard Strickling are part of a fine cast that brings this compelling true story to life.DVD extras include deleted scenes, audio commentary by director Allen Coulter and three above-average "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, which discuss old Hollywood and the actual Reeves case.Michael B.

"Who is Keyser Soze?"Christopher McQuarrie won a well-deserved Best Original Screenplay Oscar for this stylish, mesmerizing gangster thriller, which demands multiple viewings.Directed by Bryan Singer, the story, told in flashback, tells of five criminals who meet in a New York police line-up, then form a gang to pull off multiple robberies. They soon discover, however, that they are being manipulated by Keyser Soze, a much-feared, legendary master criminal who each has unknowingly wronged.Gabriel Byrne, Best Supporting Actor winner Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak and Benicio Del Toro are the crooks, while Chazz Palminteri is the cop who has to figure out what happened when all but Spacey died while pulling their last job. Pete Postlethwaite and Suzy Amis are also in the cast.This 1995 release has one of the most memorable surprise endings in movie history.MGM/UA's "Special Edition" of THE USUAL SUSPECTS has deleted scenes, several featurettes that include new interviews with the cast and filmmakers and audio commentary by Singer and McQuarrie.Michael B.

I first became acquainted with John Buchan's classic spy novel, THE 39 STEPS, when I was in the seventh grade and my literature teacher read it aloud in class. The story fascinated me and looked forward to that class every day, so that I could hear the next chapter or two. I didn't see a film dramatization of Buchan's work until 1959 when I was a senior in high school.VCI Entertainment has now released that movie, directed in Eastman Color by Ralph Thomas, onto DVD.THE 39 STEPS (1959) is a very good, entertaining thriller. Kenneth More is quite likable as Buchan's hero, Richard Hannay, who finds that he must go on the run, heading to Scotland, after a British secret service agent (Faith Brook) winds up dead in his London flat. It's a race against time. With both the police and numerous foreign agents after him, Hannay has only forty-eight hours to prevent the plans for a vital weapons system from being transported out of the country. Taina Elg co-stars as the reluctant schoolteacher who Hannay "drafts" into helping him achieve his goal.The "elephant in the room," of course, is Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1939 filming of THE 39 STEPS, which this 1959 version draws from liberally. I didn't see Hitchcock's movie until I was, I believe, a sophomore in college.There is really no comparison between the two pictures.Ralph Thomas made a delightful chase movie that can/should be enjoyed in its own right...but he was not Hitchcock.Nobody can remake Hitchcock...except Hitchcock.Michael B.

BEAUTIFUL BOY is the gripping story of a parent's worst nightmare.Maria Bello and Michael Sheen star as a married couple on the verge of separation who have stayed together for the past ten years because of their son.One day, the boy (Kyle Gallner), a college freshman, walks into a classroom with two loaded guns, kills seventeen people, then turns a weapon on himself.Shocked, grief-stricken and confused, Bello and Sheen now attempt to deal with the media storm that suddenly surrounds them, the subtle (and overt) shunning by friends and family and their own senses of guilt.Directed by Shawn Ku, BEAUTIFUL BOY is a powerful, albeit depressing, drama that features award-caliber performances by its two stars, realistic dialogue and several emotionally draining scenes.The problem is that the film takes 101 minutes to tell a story that could probably have been better told in half the time. Indeed, once the initial shock of the shooting and its immediate aftermath has past, the film focuses on Bello and Keller and their tenuous relationship. There are no surprises or significant plot turns, and it doesn't take an astute viewer to know how this story is going to end.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains two deleted scenes.Michael B.

Director Martin Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY (1983) has much in common with his TAXI DRIVER (1976), with the exception that the earlier film is a stark, violent drama and the latter is played for laughs, albeit dark, poignant ones.Both films deal with individuals, isolated from the mainstream of society, whose frustration ultimately causes them to lash out in order to get what they want. And, both movies have similar ironic endings.Robert DeNiro stars THE KING OF COMEDY, playing a nerdy comedian wannabe who, after numerous rejections from his staff, kidnaps talk show host Jerry Lewis and holds him hostage in order to get a shot on his television show. Amorous Lewis fan Sandra Bernhard is his partner in the plot.Perhaps the most interesting character in the piece is the one played by Lewis. Though adored by his public and catered to by his staff, he is actually just as lonely and isolated as the DeNiro and Bernhard characters.An excellent, under appreciated film.Michael B. Druxman

There's much to like in THE BLACK DAHLIA, the 2006 filming of author James Ellroy best-selling novel that was inspired by Los Angeles' most infamous unsolved murder case.Director Brian DePalma has not only recreated Los Angeles of the 1940s to perfection, but he has also filled the film with several memorable sequences.These include the discovery of Elizabeth Short's severed body at the same time that a police shoot-out is taking place on the next block, and, later, a triple murder on a three-story open staircase in an office building.On the other hand, Ellroy's novel and Josh Friedman's screenplay adaptation are both very complex, with multiple storylines continually criss-crossing to the point where the picture is sometimes difficult to follow.An audience can only assimilate so much exposition at one time. Thus, this is that rare movie that would have benefited from a longer running time, so that these storylines could have been better developed.The principal plot revolves around the relationship between two Los Angeles police detectives, both former boxers who are now partnered. Josh Hartnett is the younger, more idealistic of the pair, while Aaron Eckhart has the experience, but is also plagued by demons from his past that are stirred up by The Black Dahlia case. Indeed, he becomes obsessed with Ms. Short's grisly murder.Scarlett Johansson is Eckhart's platonic girl friend, who is attracted to Hartnett. She also has a dark secret, as does Hilary Swank, the bi-sexual, nymphomaniac spoiled daughter of a wealthy contractor who Hartnett ultimately discovers is the key to the Dahlia mystery.There are some fine performances in THE BLACK DAHLIA. I was most impressed with Mia Kirshner as Ms. Short, Mike Starr as a police detective and, although some critics have disagreed, Ms. Swank as the femme fatale.The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains three excellent "Making of" documentaries, the most interesting of which has Ellroy discussing the facts of the actual The Black Dahlia case and revealing the personal tragedy (i.e. the murder of his mother when he was ten-years-old) that compelled him to write his novel.Michael B.

Ostensibly based on an actual murder case that is still unsolved, this Rob Schmidt-directed thriller is more about obsession that it is about the ghastly crimes at its center.After a 10-year-old girl is found brutally murdered outside of Rochester, New York, police detective Eliza Dushku becomes so fixated on the killing that she has a mental breakdown. Two years later, after she's out of the hospital and back working a desk job, two similar cases occur and Eliza, who is now taking medication for her schizophrenia, is allowed to go along with lead detective Tom Malloy (who also wrote the screenplay) as a consultant.Unfortunately, Eliza's horrific hallucinations return as she tries to prove a "double initial" connection between the slayings. Her grip on reality continues to slip, and she herself becomes a fugitive as she zeroes in on the killer.The fictional ending to the film is both sad and ironic.Ms. Dushku delivers a chilling performance as a woman constantly on the brink of losing her sanity. The fine supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Michael Ironside, Timothy Hutton, Melissa Leo and Martin Donovan.

Visually fascinating, THE BIG BANG is an uncredited, updated rip-off of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe mystery, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. The plot outline and characters are virtually identical to Chandler's classic film noir, and director Tony Krantz even "borrows" some memorable touches from Edward Dmytryk's 1944 filming of the story, MURDER, MY SWEET.Among the many problems with THE BIG BANG is that Krantz and screenwriter Erik Jendresen have decided to update the Chandler story at all. The novelist's stories are set in 1930s-1940s Los Angeles, and that's where they belong.The filmmakers have added a few new twists to the mystery and, worst of all, they've now tied the solution into "The Big Bang Theory," which results in the audience being subjected to a raft of talk about physics in a movie that is already burdened with stilted dialogue.Antonio Banderas plays the honest private eye who is hired by a big palooka to find the stripper girl friend that disappeared while he was serving a jail sentence. Also in the cast are Sam Elliott, Delroy Lindo and several other good actors who, in all probability, did their roles for the paycheck.Although I admire Dmytryk's filming of the Chandler novel, which starred Dick Powell, I think that the best movie version of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY was made in 1975 with Robert Mitchum. In any event, both of those are better than this one.Michael B. Druxman

This 1997 thriller from director Bob Rafelson is a first-rate piece of film noir, populated with a fascinating cast of multi-dimensional characters and filled with enough dramatic plot twists to keep viewers off-balance right up until the finish.Though he lives in a nice house, drives an expensive car and has a beautiful wife (Judy Davis), Florida wine merchant Jack Nicholson is virtually broke. That's why he's enlisted the aid of career criminal Michael Caine to help him steal a diamond necklace worth over a million dollars.The burglary goes well, but when Davis discovers that Jack is about to run off with his mistress (Jennifer Lopez), she gets violent, knocks him unconscious, then flees with her grown son, Stephen Dorff, who has taken a liking to Lopez, not aware that she's involved with step-father Nicholson. Unknowingly, mother and son have also fled the scene with the diamond necklace, which means that Jack and the very vicious Caine have no choice but to go after them.The DVD has some excellent extras, including audio commentary by Rafelson, Nicholson, Caine and others, deleted scenes and several retrospective documentary featurettes.Michael B.

This is perhaps the best action-thriller to come along since the BOURNE movies. It has a good, straight-forward plot, characters that we care about and action sequences that may, at times, get a bit "over the top," but never to the point of being ridiculous.Liam Neeson stars as a retired CIA agent, working an occasional security gig, who is forced back into action when his teenage daughter is kidnapped by white slavers while she is visiting Paris with a friend. Liam knows that he has only 96 hours in which to find the girl before she disappears forever, and the French authorities are no help whatsoever. In fact, many of them, are corrupt and on the payroll of the kidnappers.Like DEATH WISH, Taken is one of those movies where you actually cheer when Neeson kills one of the bad guys...and he kills a lot of them.The DVD contains both the theatrical and an extended edition.Michael B.

This 90-minute documentary is filled with interviews with approximately 100 of this country's most popular comedians, all discussing "The Aristocrats," ostensibly the world's dirtiest joke.It's not so much that the joke itself is funny. What puts audiences into absolute hysterics is the special way that each of the comics present it. In this respect, top honors certainly go to George Carlin and Gilbert Gottfried.Other talents who appear in the film by Penn Jillette & Paul Provenza are Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, Don Rickles, Drew Carey, Eric Idle, Penn & Teller, Sarah Silverman, The Smothers Brothers and Phyllis Diller.There are plenty of extras on the DVD, but the most enjoyable is hearing some of the comedians tell their other favorite jokes.Michael B.

COPPER is a cop show set in New York City during the Civil War.But, this is not the New York police force as seen on LAW & ORDER. This department is filled with corruption. Police brutality and vigilante justice run rampant, and, of course, there is no such thing as a search warrant.Created by Tom Fontana, Will Rokos and executive produced by Barry Levinson, the ten episode, one-hour series is filled with intriguing characters and shocking plot-twists that will surprise even the most astute viewers of television drama.Detective Kevin Corcoran (Tom Weston-Jones) returns home to 1864 New York from the Civil War battlefields to discover that his daughter has been murdered and his wife has disappeared. Assigned to Five Points, the most dangerous area of the city, Corcoran seeks the truth about what happened to his family while investigating different crimes, such as the murder of a child, which his superiors would prefer to cover up because the killer is a politically-connected member of New York's upper class.Quite often, Corcoran's investigations lead him to the emerging African-American community in Northern Manhattan, or to the steps of the New York elite on Fifth Avenue, and, in one story arc, he and a wealthy friend (Kyle Schmidt) uncover a Confederate plot to burn the city to the ground.COPPER is a truly engrossing series that does a superb job of recreating a troubled time and place in America's past. Aside from Weston-Jones and Schmidt, the fine cast includes Kevin Ryan, Dylan Taylor, Anastasia Griffith, Ato Essandoh, Kiara Glasco and Franka Potente.The three-disc DVD set from BBC Video includes sever "Behind the Scenes" featurettes and deleted scenes.Michael B.

Based on a true story, LONELY HEARTS is a powerful thriller that is even more compelling because it was written and directed by Todd Robinson, grandson of homicide cop Elmer C. Robinson, one of the key detectives responsible for bringing to justice Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, a pair of psychopathic killers who preyed on rich, lonely women during the late 1940s. Although they were only charged with three murders, it is believed that these "Lonely Hearts Killers" were responsible for 17 more.John Travolta (as Elmer Robinson), James Gandolfini and Scott Caan play the detectives, while Jared Leto and Salma Hayek are cast as Fernandez and Beck. Also in the cast are Alice Krige and Laura Dern.Director Robinson has done a masterful job of recreating the look and feel of the post-war 1940s. The actors all deliver cutting-edge performances. Although she looks nothing like the real, overweight Martha Beck, Hayek's sultry portrayal is absolutely frightening.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains an above average "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

HORTON HEARS A WHO! is a charming, fun-filled animated feature, adapted from the story by Dr. Seuss.Horton is a playful elephant who becomes a reluctant hero when he discovers that Who-ville, a microscopic city, exists on a floating speck of dust. Despite the efforts of the other animals in the mythical jungle to stop him, Horton undertakes a perilous and hilarious journey in order to bring that speck of dust and all its inhabitants to safety.Jim Carrey is a delight as the voice of care-free Horton, as is Steve Carell, who supplies the voice of the mayor of Who-ville, considered to be a bumbling boob by the city council and the town's citizens. In a "Making of" featurette on the 2-disc "Special Edition" DVD from 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment, we see how the ad-libs from these two funnymen often caused the producers to adjust their story.Carol Burnett voices an ultra-conservative kangaroo, who leads the other jungle creatures in an effort to stop Horton from saving Who-ville, and Will Arnett is her nefarious "hitman," a vulture. Amy Poehler, Seth Rogen and Isla Fisher voice other characters.The animation in this feature, directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, is marvelous. They supply audio commentary, and the package also has a new animated ICE AGE short, deleted footage, many "Behind the Scenes" featurettes and a digital copy.Michael B. Druxman

DIRTY GIRL is a funny, ultimately touching, coming-of-age/road movie that undergoes a major shift in tone during its third act, and yet remains an extremely satisfying viewing experience.Written and directed by Abe Sylvia, the film is set in ultra-conservative Norman, Oklahoma in 1987, and centers on Danielle (Juno Temple), the high school tramp, who is paired on a class parenting project with fellow student Clarke (Jeremy Dozier), an overweight gay kid.When Danielle's mother (Milla Jovovich) announces her engagement to her strict-minded Mormon boy friend (William H. Macy, in a role that should make Mitt Romney cringe), the girl decides to head for Fresno, California, to finally meet her biological father, and because he has a car and a credit card, she drafts Clarke to accompany her.Unfortunately, that prized Cadillac belongs to Clarke's violent homophobic father (Dwight Yoakam), who goes after the couple, while his repressed wife (Mary Steenburgen) and Danielle's mom join forces to also bring their kids home.DIRTY GIRL is a clever, witty, well-acted "gem," a true audience-pleaser.[Watch that bag of flour. It almost steals the show.]Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include audio commentary by Abe Sylvia and deleted/extended scenes.Michael B. Druxman

James Toback wrote and directed this intriguing erotic thriller about a wealthy girl (Neve Campbell) who likes to walk on the wild side.For some unaccountable reason, Neve is romantically involved with a low class hustler (Fred Weller) who is always looking for a new con. Just now, he's met a ultra-rich Italian count (Dominic Chianese) who has seen Neve, wants to meet her and, for this service offers Weller $100,000.More out of curiosity than anything else, Neve agrees to the meeting and then, almost off the top of her head, decides to get even with these two men who think of her as a piece of merchandise.Exquisitely written, directed and acted (Campbell has never been better), this is a first rate film, endowed with a subtle tension and a couple of surprise plot twists, that deserves to be seen.Extras include audio commentary by Toback, plus an on-screen conversation with the director and Campbell in which they discuss the film's sexually-oriented scenes.

This first-rate gangster/caper thriller is filled with sharp, crackling dialogue from writer-director David Mamet and features a cutting edge cast, headed by Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito and Delroy Lindo.Hackman plays a veteran thief who runs a top crew that seldom makes mistakes. When his fence (DeVito) stiffs him on his last job, Hackman, who had planned to retire, is forced to pull off one last heist, the hijacking of an air cargo plane carrying a fortune in Swiss gold.Like with many of Mamet's films, nothing in HEIST is what it appears to be. "Double-cross" is the name of the game, thus delicious plot-twists and some sharp action sequences are in abundance right up until the final credits roll.Sam Rockwell and Rebecca Pidgeon (Mrs. Mamet) co-star.Michael B.

TWENTIETH CENTURY (1934) is perhaps the greatest of all screwball comedies and is the film that established Carole Lombard as the "queen" of that genre. Howard Hawks directed the Charles MacArthur/Ben Hecht screenplay.John Barrymore, in what may be his "grandest ham" performance, is an egomaniacal Broadway director who discovers shopgirl Lombard and builds her into a major star, as well as making her his mistress. Their relationship is a volatile one, thus three years later she leaves him to go to Hollywood and, shortly thereafter, he goes broke producing plays without her.Sneaking out of Chicago on the Twentieth Century to New York, Barrymore discovers that Lombard is a fellow passenger. Now, if he can only sign her to a contact before they reach their destination, he can get the financing for his next production. The only problem is that she hates him...or does she?Walter Connolly and Roscoe Karns co-star.Michael B. Druxman

"I fear you speak upon the rack, where men enforced do speak anything."That's a line from Shakespeare's THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, and it's also a key theme in RENDITION, a disturbing, yet very good film, released onto DVD by New Line Home Entertainment.Omar Metwally plays an Egyptian citizen, a successful chemical engineer who has lived in the United States since he was 14-years old. He's married to Reese Witherspoon, has a young son and another child on the way.On his way back to his home in Chicago from a scientific conference in South Africa, he is intercepted at the Washington D.C. airport and taken into custody by the CIA. They believe he is a terrorist and may be responsible for a recent bombing in North Africa. Even though he passes a lie detector test and there is no credible evidence against him, CIA chief Meryl Streep orders that he be sent back to Africa for interrogation and torture.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a low level CIA agent, assigned to oversee Metwally's interrogation. He becomes increasingly uncomfortable with what he observes, particularly after he becomes convinced that the man is innocent.Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard are cast as the U.S. Senator and his chief aide to whom Witherspoon turns when her husband disappears.RENDITION, directed by Gavin Hood, is a tense, exciting political thriller that follows multiple characters and storylines to a powerful climax. There is also a major surprise near the end of the film.Special features on the DVD include audio commentary by Hood, several deleted scenes, a "Making of" documentary and another documentary that shows that events like those portrayed in this film actually happen.

It took plenty of guts for screen heroes Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis to tackle their unsavory roles in the gritty SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS (1957), the story of an avaricious New York press agent (Curtis) who will stop at nothing to win the favor of a powerful New York gossip columnist (Lancaster).The film, written by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman, and directed by Alexander Mac Kendrick has achieved cult status. It is just as powerful today as when it was released over fifty years ago.Via James Wong Howe's stark black-and-white cinematography, Mac Kendrick utilizes Times Square to such an unusual extent in his staging that it almost becomes a character in the movie. The performances, particularly Curtis, Lancaster and Barbara Nichols' sad, lonely cigarette girl, are terrific.The Criterion Collection has released a new, 2-disc, restored high-definition edition of SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, which contains some fabulous extras. Among them is a 1986 documentary about Mac Kendrick, which features interviews with the director, Lancaster, actor James Coburn and others.A second documentary, made in 1973, focuses on cinematographer James Wong Howe, who even gives some tutorials on movie lighting,There are new video interviews with film critic Neil Gabler, who talks about legendary newspaper columnist Walter Winchell, the inspiration for Lancaster's character, and also filmmaker James Mangold, a student of Mac Kendrick.Audio commentary for the movie is provided by film scholar James Naremore, and there is also a booklet in the set that contains an essay by critic Gary Giddens, a pair of short stories by Lehman, featuring the key characters in the film, plus and excerpt from Mac Kendrick's book on film making.Michael B.

In the interest of fairness and full disclosure, I must admit that PIRANHA in any "D" is not my kind of movie. Usually, I try to avoid watching films of this genre because I hate losing those 90-120 minutes of my life that I can never get back again.Also, since I do not own a 3-D Blu-Ray player or television set, I opted to watch this movie on regular DVD.That said, I have no doubt that this sequel to PIRANHA 3D (2010) will more than please the audience for which it was intended (i.e. people who enjoy watching movies in which monster fish eat other people.) In fact, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames, both of whom were in the first picture, are back for this one.The JAWS-like plot is set in moneymaking Big Wet Water Park where the prehistoric flesh-eating fish find a smorgasbord on the attraction's opening day of summer.The problem with this picture, directed by John Gulager, is that the filmmakers can't seem to decide whether they wanted to make an all out horror film or an all out spoof. As it turned out, the movie is neither. In the first half, the gore factor is just too much to evoke laughs, and some of the humorous sequences attempted (e.g. a sex scene with disastrous results) are too ridiculous to be funny.Truthfully, while watching the movie, I was tempted several times to turn the damn thing off...but I'm glad that I didn't, because about midway through, David Hasselhoff makes his first appearance (playing himself and making light of his public image), and then PIRANHA 3DD becomes fun...even for me. It becomes the all out spoof that it should have been from the start.Hasselhoff is terrific, as are Lloyd and Rhames, who are obviously enjoying their roles. Also in the cast are Gary Busey, Danielle Panabaker, Matt Bush, David Koechner and the director's father, Clu Gulager.The 3-disc (3D, Blu-Ray, DVD) combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including a "Making of" featurettes, deleted scenes and bloopers.Michael B.

IN BRUGES is the best movie I've seen so far this year. Granted, I've seen very few 2008 films, but the reality is that there have not been many that I've had a desire to see.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, IN BRUGES is a quirky, totally unpredictable dark comedy that stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as a pair of Dublin hit men, who are sent to the small Belgium city by their crime lord boss (Ralph Fiennes) to hide out after their last contract killing goes terribly wrong.Gleeson becomes very touristy, wanting to savor everything about Europe's most well-preserved medieval city, but Farrell is totally bored until he encounters a Dutch film crew and a couple of people involved with the shoot.I'm not going to reveal any more details about the story, because I don't want to spoil its many surprises.IN BRUGES is, essentially, a gangster movie, but unlike so many other pictures of this genre, its characters are endowed with a humanity that allows them to change for the better. Like the plot, writer-director McDonagh's dialogue is refreshingly witty.The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment has deleted scenes, a gag reel and "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, including one on the film's extensive profanity.Michael B.

I've never seen the 1940s serial version of THE GREEN HORNET and, although I'm sure I watched an episode or two of the 1960s television series with Bruce Lee, I really have no memory of it. I also don't recall ever reading the comic book or hearing the radio show.Truthfully, superhero movies are not really my thing. I may have enjoyed them thirty years ago, but I have long since outgrown that sort of entertainment.Thus, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I started viewing this new version of THE GREEN HORNET, primarily because it's really a spoof of the genre. Much of the film works, but also much of it doesn't work.As all loyal followers of this superhero know, The Green Hornet is a masked vigilante whose real identity is multi-millionaire Britt Reid, and his trusted sidekick, Kato, assists him.In this version, Reid is played as a wealthy, egotistical, somewhat cowardly, schmuck who dreams of being a superhero, and it's his driver, Kato, who is really the brains and the kick-ass brawn of the duo.That's a very funny concept, and it works quite a bit of the time...until it becomes tired, repetitive and disintegrates into little more than a special effects/CGI action movie. That's sad, because this picture could have become a classic lampoon, much like MEN IN BLACK was to sci-fi films.Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the uneven screenplay with Evan Goldberg, is quite good as Reid and Jay Chou is a perfect choice for Kato. However, it's Christoph Waltz' amusing, low-key playing of the demented super-villain that you'll remember most in this handsomely produced film.Michel Gondry directed a top supporting cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos.Michael B.

I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I didn't like THE DARK KNIGHT. In fact, after watching it a second time, I gave my DVDs of both this film and BATMAN BEGINS to my son.Why didn't I like it?(1) The movie looks great, but it is also too long. I was checking my watch after the first 40 minutes. I think we could have easily done without The Joker's final caper.(2) There are so many plot threads that many of are not well developed.(3) With the exception of the opening bank robbery sequence, the action sequences may be flashy, but they are also over-extended to the point where they become tiring.(4) Christian Bale may be a fine actor, but as Bruce Wayne/Batman he is so dour that he's dull. I kept waiting for the movie to cut back to The Joker.(5) When I was watching the film in the theater, like everybody else, I was very impressed with Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. However, watching the picture a second time on DVD, I was less taken with his performance. This time, I could see "the actor" at work. [I'm writing this on the night before the Oscars. I'm sure he'll win.]In all fairness, I must admit that I am not a big fan of superhero movies. They're just not my cup of tea.So, why did I review this one?Because Amazon keeps putting a "Review Request" for the DVD on my page, so I figured that this was a good way to get rid of it.:-)Michael B.

THE WAY TO THE STARS (1945) is the story of an airfield and the people who pass through it from 1940 to 1944.What's interesting about this war film, also known as JOHNNY IN THE CLOUDS, is that, although it is set during World War II, there are no battle scenes. All of the action takes place at the British military airfield and in the small nearby village.At first, it's the British who fly bombing missions from the field, but then the Americans come in and most of the Brits are transferred elsewhere.The film was written by Terence Rattigan, directed by Anthony Asquith and stars John Mills, Michael Redgrave, Rosamund John, Douglass Montgomery, Basil Radford and Stanley Holloway. It also features the first film appearances of Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons.THE WAY TO THE STARS is filled with three-dimensional characters who grow and mature as the events of the world conflict affect their individual lives and relationships. This is one of the most touching war movies I've ever seen. I cannot recommend it too highly.Michael B. Druxman

SEA OF SAND (1958), also known as DESERT PATROL, was shot in the Libyan Desert and takes place just before the climatic North Africa battle of El Alamein.Michael Craig leads a secret commando mission against Rommel's forces. The target is a German fuel dump, located hundreds of miles behind enemy lines, and their job is to destroy it. However, Craig and his men also discover that the Germans are equipped with many new tanks, a fact that desperately must be reported to their superiors. Unfortunately, with their radio out, their vehicles damaged or destroyed and German patrols hot on their trail, accomplishing that is not going to be an easy task.Directed by Guy Green and co-starring Richard Attenborough and John Gregson, SEA OF SAND is an exciting, action-filled drama that features some stunning desert photography.Michael B.

After seeing it a second time, I think that ATONEMENT should have won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 2007. It is a rich, sweeping production; a touching romantic drama that transports you back to a simpler, albeit more dangerous, time and place.There is also a surprise, absolutely unforgettable ending.Ian McEwan's acclaimed novel was adapted to the screen by Christopher Hampton and directed by Joe Wright.Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play the star-crossed lovers whose lives are destroyed by a vicious lie told by her younger sister, played at different times on the picture by Oscar-nominated Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.With a great film, like ATONEMENT, you see many things in a second viewing that you missed the first time around. For example, the occasional sound of a typewriter on the soundtrack takes on an entirely new meaning, as does a brief scene of McAvoy walking through a field of poppies.There is also a 5-minute stedicam sequence on the beach at Dunkirk that makes Orson Welles' brilliant opening sequence in TOUCH OF EVIL look like child's play.The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains two excellent "Making of" featurettes, deleted scenes and audio commentary by director Wright.Michael B.

LUST FOR GOLD (1949) is very interesting western.Ostensibly the true story of the fabled Lost Dutchman Gold Mine in Arizona's Superstition Mountains, the movie casts Glenn Ford as Jacob "Dutch" Walz, perhaps the most villainous role of his career.Walz, according to this story, murdered several men, including his partner (Edgar Buchanan) in order to keep the location of his mine secret. However, when he meets Julia Thomas (Ida Lupino), he falls hard and is about to share his wealth with her until he learns that she and her husband (Gig Young), plan to steal the fortune from him. Walz' love quickly turns to thoughts of a brutal revenge.Directed by S. Sylvan Simon, LUST FOR GOLD is actually two stories. There is the historical one, plus a modern tale in which Walz' grandson (William Prince) seeks the mine, only to be stalked by a mysterious killer.This first-rate western is a mix of film noir and thriller.Michael B.

This is a science-fiction movie without space ships, evil (or friendly) alien creatures or an apocalyptic vision. Most of the action, in fact, takes place in a single room. Yet, this is one of the most mesmerizing sci-fi films I've seen in years.Written by the late Jerome Bixby, a renowned author of the genre, the film is set in a remote cabin on a very cold night. A group of college professors have gathered to say goodbye to one of their colleagues (David Lee Smith), who has decided, without reasonable explanation, to move on.As they chat among themselves, Smith makes an extraordinary announcement: He is an immortal who has migrated through 140 centuries of evolution.Is Smith just pulling his friends' legs? Is he insane? Or, is he telling the truth?Over the next hour or so, these learned individuals, most of whom are scientists, probe Smith with questions and, after another of his startling revelations, find their own notions of history, religion and humanity shattered.Directed by Richard Schenkman, this literate film is exquisitely acted by a fine cast that includes John Billingsley, Ellen Crawford, William Katt, Annika Peterson, Richard Riehle, Alexis Thorpe and Tony Todd.Michael B.

Directed by Taylor Hackford, this exceptional 1988 drama not only deals with the vicissitudes of a 25-year marriage, but also the fleeting aspects of fame.Taking place from the mid-1950s into the 1980s, the film casts Dennis Quaid as the All-American football player, turned pro, and Jessica Lange as the Magnolia Queen who gave up her career to become a wife and mother.The dynamics of the marriage shift as Quaid's gridiron glories diminish and Jessica, now the mother of four, is forced to become the family's principal financial support. Yet, through all their problems, the couple's love for each other endures.Timothy Hutton is Quaid's nephew, who secretly loves his uncle's wife, John Goodman plays Dennis' best friend whose addiction to gambling almost causes the family's ruin and Carl Lumbly is an African-American friend of Quaid, the movie's symbol of the country's changing attitude toward civil rights during the 1960s. Patricia Clarkson is also in the perfectly chosen cast.This is a film that you will not soon forget.Michael B. Druxman

I guess that some people consider BIRD OF PARADISE (1932) to be a "classic," but the truth is that really just an old movie; a "chestnut" that has not passed the test of time.Certainly I can understand why the picture was so popular back when it was first released. It was produced by David O. Selznick, directed by King Vidor, featured two attractive stars, Dolores del to and Joel McCrea, and it transported movie audiences to an exotic world which they had never before seen.McCrea plays a world adventurer, who sails to a South Seas island where he promptly falls in love with the island's princess (Ms. del Rio), who has a date to be sacrificed to the volcano god.Shot in glorious black-and-white, the movie is enhanced by some handsome Hawaiian locales, a memorable score from Max Steiner and a couple of risqu&eacute; Pre-Code sequences, including a nude swimming scene.But the story itself is dated and rather silly and, for an audience today, politically incorrect.On the other hand, the new DVD of BIRD OF PARADISE from Kino Classics is certainly the best home video presentation ever of this public domain film. It was mastered in HD from an original nitrate 35mm print, preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and licensed by the David O. Selznick estate. There is some very minor frame damage, but the overall picture and sound are great.Michael B. Druxman

Part mystery, part love story, part political thriller, director Fernando Meirelles' THE CONSTANT GARDENER was one of the very best films of 2005.Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz star in this adaptation of John LeCarre's novel that takes some effective shots at the international pharmaceutical business.Fiennes plays a rather passive British diplomat, stationed in Africa, and Rachel is his activist wife who too often sticks her nose into very dangerous situations that makes some highly placed politicians nervous.It's no spoiler to reveal that Rachel is murdered, since this event takes place within the first five minutes or so of the movie. Virtually her entire role is seen in flashback sequences, as Fiennes thinks back on their relationship in his quest to learn who killed his wife and why.His investigation uncovers a sinister conspiracy between big business and members of the British government that will destroy millions of innocent lives if it isn't stopped. Soon, Fiennes finds himself being stalked by the same forces that killed his wife.Danny Huston, Bill Nighy and Pete Postlethwaite co-star in this superbly acted and scripted nail-biter.DVD extras include deleted scenes and several "Behind-the-Scenes" featurettes, including a fine one on Le Carre.Michael B.

Unlike many religious films of the 1950s, the first CinemaScope movie, adapted from the Lloyd C. Douglas novel, does not suffer from a aura of self-importance, primarily because it has a strong dramatic story with interesting, multi-layered characters.Richard Burton stars as the Roman centurion charged with overseeing the Crucifixion, but when he wins Christ's robe in a gambling game at the foot of the cross, he becomes "possessed".Indeed, back in Rome, his fiance' (Jean Simmons) and the aging emperor believe that he has become mentally unbalanced and that the only cure for him is to return to Palestine, find the robe and destroy it. The outcome of this quest, however, turns out quite differently, with Burton becoming a Christian and standing against the new emperor, Caligula (a marvelous, over-the-top performance by Jay Robinson).Henry Koster directed THE ROBE. Victor Mature and Michael Rennie co-star. Michael Ansara appears unbilled as "Judas".Extras in the new "Special Edition" include an Introduction by Martin Scorsese, a "Making of" featurette, a short about the CinemaScope process, audio commentary by composer David Newman and film historians and much more.Michael B.

BEYOND is an interesting, rather entertaining, hybrid; part police procedural mystery and part supernatural thriller. If it has a problem, it's that the filmmakers are not quite sure which one they want it to be.Filmed in Anchorage, Alaska, the film stars Jon Voight as a "take no prisoners" veteran detective, who specializes in cases involving missing children. When the seven-year-old niece of his boss (Dermot Mulroney) is kidnapped, Voight starts working the case, but soon finds himself bothered when the girl's mother (Teri Polo) enlists the help of a radio psychic (Julian Morris), who claims that a "ghost" is putting him into contact with the lost child.The actors are good, and Greg Gieras' script has a couple of intriguing twists that raise this film a step above other movies of the genre. Director Josef Rusnak keeps the action moving along at a nice pace, taking full advantage of the breathtaking Alaskan scenery. I just wish that, in post-production, he and the editor hadn't added so many "BOOMS" to the sound track."BOOMS" are effective in a horror movie when a filmmaker want s to underscore a scary moment, to get viewers to "jump in their seats". But, this sound effect is so overused in BEYOND, which is not really a horror movie, that it becomes annoying.On DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.Michael B. Druxman

Though a work of fiction, the mesmerizing TRUE CONFESSIONS (1981) was inspired by Los Angeles' infamous and still unsolved "Black Dahlia" murder case of the post-war 1940s.Adapted from John Gregory Dunne's novel, the story centers on the Spellacy brothers. One of them, Desmond (Robert DeNio) is a highly regarded Catholic monsignor and the other, Tom (Robert Duvall is a homicide cop.Both brothers are "corrupt" in their own individual ways. Tom was once a "bagman" for former pimp Jack Amsterdam (Charles Durning), now a building contractor who does much of his work for the Church, thanks to his close relationship with Desmond.When the dismembered body of a young actress is found in a field, we soon learn that Desmond, Amsterdam and some of the other pillars of the Church knew the girl. Tom, in fact, is convinced that Amsterdam is the killer.Ulu Grosbard directed this low-key, intriguing drama, which does an excellent job of recreating a bygone era. DeNiro and Duvall are both in top form, and the cast also includes Burgess Meredith and Ed Flanders.Michael B. Druxman

Beautifully adapted by Susannah Grant from the novel by Jennifer Weiner, exquisitely directed by Curtis Hanson and played to perfection by Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, Shirley MacLaine and a hand-picked cast, this overlooked family comedy was one of the very best films of 2005.Collette and Diaz are sisters, living in Philadelphia. Toni is a responsible attorney with a low self-image when it comes to men, while Cameron is a flaky, flirty, uneducated party girl who detests work and leaches off of her sister. The girls have a major falling out when Toni discovers Cameron in bed with her (Toni's) boy friend.Out on the street, Cameron discovers that she has a long lost grandmother (MacLaine) living in a Florida retirement community, so she heads South, figuring that she'll mooch off the old lady for awhile.Shirley, however, is not that easily taken in and she forces her newly-found granddaughter to not only turn her life around, but also effects a reconciliation with her sister.IN HER SHOES is a joyful, very human film; one that can be enjoyed over multiple viewings. The supporting cast includes Mark Feuerstein as Toni's fiance', Ken Howard as her and Cameron's father, and Norman Lloyd as an ailing college professor who touches Cameron's heart.The above average "Behind the Scenes" featurettes include one about the Florida seniors who played small roles in the movie and another about how a dog was saved from the pound to play a key part in the film.Michael B.

HIGHER GROUND is a movie about "Faith": people searching for Faith, people struggling with Faith, and, finally, people coming to the realization that they never have had or never will have Faith.Vera Farmiga both directed and stars in this engrossing drama about a young woman, pregnant then married at eighteen, who gives herself over to a New Testament church, only to eventually question the religious dogma she has embraced.Based on the memoir, THIS DARK WORLD by Carolyn S. Briggs, HIGHER GROUND not only boasts an exceptional directorial debut and an award-caliber performance by Ms. Farmiga, but it also features a stellar cast that includes John Hawkes, Donna Murphy, Joshua Leonard and Norbert Leo Butz.Extras on the 2-disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include audio commentary by Ms. Farmiga, Joshua Leonard and producer Renn Hawkey, deleted scenes, a "Making of" featurette and a Q&A; session from the L.A. Film Festival.Michael B. Druxman

Although I have enjoyed it the few times that I've seen it, most recently about four months ago, I've never been a fan of Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS (1971). It's not a bad film. It's just not one of the director's best. I think he was more comfortable working with stories set in the American West than in rural England.For the most part, I don't like remakes. But, since the original STRAW DOGS is no classic, I don't have a problem with it being remade. On the other hand, was a remake really necessary?That said, I do believe that the basic story works better in this new 2011 version than in Peckinpah's picture. Most of the changes are cosmetic, but they are improvements.Now set in backwoods Mississippi, the story centers on Daivd and Amy Sumner (James Marsden, Kate Bosworth), a Hollywood couple who move to Amy's family home to prepare the house for sale and so that David can have a quiet place to write his screenplay. Once there, tensions build in their marriage and also with the locals, particularly Amy's old boy friend (Alexander Skarsgard), who resents David and wants to win her back. Violence erupts, the Sumner home comes under siege and the quiet peace-loving David finds that he must now kill or be killed.Aside from the locale and the fact that the David Sumner character is now a screenwriter, rather than a mathematician, perhaps the most significant change in the this remake from writer/director Rod Lurie is that the wife, Amy, is much more sympathetic. In the original, the character was very unlikable.James Woods, Dominic Purcell and Willa Holland co-star in this well-acted, suspenseful drama, now available on DVD from Sony Home Entertainment.DVD extras include audio commentary by Lurie, plus four "Making of" featurettes."Michael B.

Despite the fact that it stars British superstars Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins, THE MALTA STORY (1953) probably would have worked better as a documentary, rather than a dramatic feature.The island of Malta, lying between the south of Italy and North Africa, was vital to the British supply lines during WW2. Bombing raids by the Axis powers were an almost daily occurrence, and the people of Malta endured near-starvation and mass destruction from those brutal raids.Newsreel footage provides a vivid picture of the island's ordeal in THE MALTA STORY, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst.The filmmaker's have also tried to create a compelling human story, with Guinness cast as a pilot photographer, forced to stay in Malta when his transport to Cairo is destroyed. There is a romance between his character and an island resident (Muriel Pavlow), who works with the British Army, and another intriguing storyline is introduced, but never fully developed, when her brother turns out to be an Axis spy.Script-wise, the problem is that the story for the survival of the island is far more moving than any of the predictable human dramas created by screenwriter Nigel Balchinor. His characters are rather two-dimensional, and the actors supply the only real spark in them.Michael B. Druxman

DIABOLIQUE (1955) is the sort of shocking, groundbreaking thriller that world audiences would have expected to see from director Alfred Hitchcock. In fact, Hitchcock, at one time, had attempted to secure the rights to the novel (by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) from which it was adapted.Instead, the picture was made in France, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and became the foundation for hundreds of later movie thrillers...even some directed by Hitchcock. Hitchcock and others may have improved on the techniques employed by Clouzot, but it all began with DIABOLIQUE.According to film critic Kim Newman, who supplies an on-camera interview in the "Special Features" section of the new release from The Criterion Collection, DIABOLIQUE was the first "major" film to feature a "twist," as opposed to a "surprise" ending. In other words, and without going into specifics, at the end of the film you realize that you have been watching an entirely different story from what you thought you'd been watching.DIABOLIQUE tells of two women, the fragile wife (Vera Clouzot) and willful mistress (Simone Signoret) of the nasty headmaster (Paul Meurisse) of a boy's boarding school, who decide to murder him, then make it appear like he drowned in the school's swimming pool. The plan is perfectly executed...until the pool is drained and the body is not there.This film is pushing sixty-years old, yet it is just as suspenseful today as it was when it was first released, and it's a hell of a lot better than so many of the over-blown cgi thrillers that are made these days.Aside from the Newman interview, other "extras" for this new digital restoration of the film include audio commentary by scholar Kelley Conway, a video introduction by filmmaker Serge Bromberg and a booklet with an essay by film critic Terrence Rafferty.Michael B.

This 1968 hit comedy about a staid Los Angeles attorney who turns Hippie may be a bit dated, but it's still a very funny movie.Peter Sellers stars as the lawyer who meets flower child Leigh Taylor-Young, then decides that there are better things "out there" than his regimented, albeit successful, lifestyle.Sellers is marvelous in this smart satire, but the most memorable performance is that of Joyce Van Patten, who plays the ardent, insecure fiancee he leaves at the altar...not once, but twice.Written by Larry Tucker and Paul Mazursky and directed by Hy Averback, this film is an entertaining 93 minutes.Michael B.

I've never been a fan of director Nicolas Roeg.I prefer straightforward storytelling in my movies and his work is just too cryptic and experimental for my taste.Nevertheless, even aside from Roeg's kaleidoscopic images, I'm not quite sure I get the complete message that screenwriter Terry Johnson is trying to put across in INSIGNIFICANCE, an adaptation of his stage play that deals with a fictional meeting between 1950s icons Marilyn Monroe (Theresa Russell), Albert Einstein (Michael Emil), Joe DiMaggio (Gary Busey) and Senator Joseph McCarthy (Tony Curtis), none of whom are specifically identified in the film.Perhaps the movie is about the burden of "celebrity," or the fact that "knowledge is not necessarily truth," or maybe it's about those ideas and a few others. Certainly there are many different thoughts tossed about in the picture's 108 minute running time.Einstein, played by Emil with a childlike innocence, and Monroe are the central figures in the piece, and the scene in which she uses flashlights and various toys to explain to him his "theory of relativity" is a delight. Also memorable is a scene with the scientist and the DiMaggio character where the great athlete justifies his "celebrity" with the fact that he was featured in 13 series of bubblegum baseball cards.Busey is marvelous as DiMaggio, as is Ms. Russell in capturing the persona of Monroe. Indeed, all of the actors shine in their individual roles. It is their performances, as well as many of the well-written scenes from the original stage play, rather than Roeg's flair for "opening up" the action, that make INSIGNIFICANCE worth watching.Among the extras in The Criterion Collection edition of the 1985 film are recent interviews with Roeg, his producer (Jeremy Thomas) and the film's editor (Tony Lawson). There is also a vintage "Making of" featurette and a 26-page booklet filled with essays about the picture.Michael B. Druxman

Would you believe that Cary Grant did not like ARSENIC AND OLD LACE?That's right! Many years ago, I had the privilege of interviewing this charming movie icon, and during our conversation, I made the mistake of telling him how much I liked the 1944 film. I don't recall his reasons, but I do remember that he suddenly got very irritable and told me how much he hated the picture.Despite what Cary Grant might have thought, most people think that this adaptation of Joseph Kesselring's hit Broadway play is one of the funniest films ever made.Directed by Frank Capra, the farcical plot tells of the oddball Brewster family of Brooklyn. The only sane member of the clan is Grant, a drama critic, but he's quickly being driven mad by one brother (John Alexander), who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, a homicidal brother (Raymond Massey), who looks like Boris Karloff, and a pair of dotty old aunts (Josephine Hull, Jean Adair), whose favorite pastime is poisoning lonely old men. Currently, there's an even dozen buried in their basement.Aside from Priscilla Lane, who plays Grant's confused new bride, the choice cast also includes Peter Lorre as a doctor with dubious credentials, Jack Carson as the neighborhood cop, James Gleason as his flustered boss and Edward Everett Horton as the head of the Happy Dale Sanitarium.BTW: In this film, Grant does what is possibly the funniest double-take in movie history.Michael B.

Though it feels like a stage play, WORKING (1982) was an original production on "American Playhouse".Adapted as a musical by Stephen Schwartz from Studs Terkel's WORKING, a book in which the author examined the hopes, dreams and viewpoints of the average American worker, this fabulous production is made up of short monologues, both spoken and sung, by Americans from all walks of life.The songs by James Taylor, Schwartz and others are first-rate, and they are performed by the likes of Rita Moreno, Barry Bostwick, Charles Durning, Patti LaBelle, Scatman Crothers, Barbara Hershey and Eileen Brennan.One number, "If I Could've Been," was so moving that we're surprised that it hasn't become a standard.Michael B.

THE DOUBLE is an entertaining, at times far-fetched, espionage thriller in which retired CIA operative Richard Gere joins forces with rookie FBI agent Topher Grace to catch "Cassius," a Cold War-era Soviet assassin who has resurfaced and is now killing more people, including a U.S. Senator.That's all I'm going to tell you about the plot of THE DOUBLE, because if I reveal more, I will be a Spoiler. There are a couple of surprising plot twists in this film, one of which even surprised me. That's not an easy thing to do.On the other hand, that final twist is where the believability factor comes into play, but I won't say more.The cast, which includes Stephen Moyer, and Martin Sheen, is very good and director Michael Brandt, who wrote the screenplay with Derek Haas, keeps the film, apparently shot in Washington, D.C., moving along at a nice pace.Extras on the DVD from Image Entertainment include producer's interviews, plus audio commentary by Brandt and Haas.Michael B.

Michael Douglas always seems to be at his best when he's playing his dark side, and in SOLITARY MAN, his character is in total self-destruct mode.The divorced, sixty-year-old, once super-successful car magnate is not only on the verge of bankruptcy, but he's also on shaky ground with his grown daughter (Jenna Fischer) and her family. People do try to throw him a lifeline, but then he does something very stupid, primarily letting his "little head" rule his "big head," and he sinks even deeper into the mire. Indeed, he's like a train wreck, painful to watch but impossible to turn away.We don't know where his character is going to end up, but Douglas certainly deserves some Oscar attention for this one.Directed by writer Brian Koppelman and David Levien, this fine film co-stars Susan Sarandon as Douglas' former wife, Mary-Louise Parker as his current girl friend, plus Jesse Eisenberg and Danny DeVito.From Anchor Bay Entertainment.Michael B.

There are only three characters in THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED: two kidnappers and the rich young woman that they grab for ransom. Most of the story takes place in a single setting, the apartment where the criminals hold the girl captive.Not wanting to be a spoiler, that's all I'm going to reveal about the story of this smart, fast-paced British thriller from writer-director J. Blakeson that is filled with some very surprising plot twists, as well as superb performances from Gemma Arterton, Martin Compston and Eddie Marsan.This is, indeed, one of the most intense, grittiest caper movies I've seen in years, and I cannot recommend it too highly.Michael B.

Director Sergio Leone may always be best remembered for the three westerns he made with Clint Eastwood, but, without doubt, his finest work in that genre came later with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1968), available on DVD in a superb 2-disc special edition from Paramount Home Entertainment.It may be a bit on the slow side, but ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is never dull. Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and Jason Robards star in this magnificently photographed epic that is part "spaghetti western" and part homage to John Ford. (His westerns were also "slow"). Indeed, Leone's footage of Monument Valley is as stunning, if not more so, than anything that Ford ever put onto the screen.The story concerns Cardinale, a New Orleans whore who has married one of her customers and come West. Upon her arrival, she learns that her new husband and his children have been murdered...by Fonda. (A brilliant bit of reverse casting). He works for the railroad, which wants her late husband's land.Robards is cast as a likable outlaw, framed for the killings by Fonda, and Bronson is a harmonica playing gunfighter who is stalking Fonda for some enigmatic reason.The film is enhanced with an exceptional recreation of frontier life, fine performances and many unforgettable moments, such as the 10-minute opening sequence, in which three gunfighters, including veteran bad guys Jack Elam and Woody Strode, wait silently at a desolate railroad station for the train carrying Bronson, their prey, to arrive. "Did you bring me a horse?" Charlie asks them.Elam glances at the three horses behind him. "Guess we're one shy," he says with a nasty grin."No," replies Bronson, "you brought two too many."Elam's grin disappears. And then, the gunfire erupts.Ennio Morricone wrote the background score for this truly great western.DVD extras include audio commentary with contributions from directors John Carpenter, John Milius, cast and crew, three documentaries including interviews with Cardinale, Gabriele Ferzetti and others, plus much more.Michael B.

This 1969 release is the second and, by far, the best of the three sequels to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960). Filmed in Spain, it has a good script by Herman Hoffman and director Paul Wendkos does not stint on the action.George Kennedy plays the role of "Chris," originated by Yul Brynner. In this new adventure, he gathers together six new gunfighters to cross back into Mexico in order to free a revolutionary leader (Fernando Rey) from an Army prison run by a cruel, brutal colonel (Michael Ansara).Among Chris' new companions are James Whitmore, Monte Markham, Bernie Casey, Joe Don Baker, Scott Thomas and Reni Santoni.An entertaining western.Michael B.

Ricky Gervais is a comedian who is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste.In this 72-minute special, filmed during his successful tour of the United States, the British funnyman not only pokes fun at charities that help the mentally and physically challenged, but also the Holocaust.The amazing thing is that you find yourself laughing out loud, sometimes uncontrollably, at the humor Gervais finds in these ordinarily taboo subjects.He also does extended hilarious routines on the male sexual organ and even Humpty Dumpty.Gervais is, indeed, one of the funniest comedians of this generation.Included on the DVD is a conversation with Gervais.Michael B.

LAWLESS is inspired by the essentially true and fascinating adventures of the legendary, seemingly "indestructible," Bondurant Brothers, bootleggers in Prohibition-era Virginia, who went to war against corrupt politicians and, in doing so, became heroes to their neighbors.Shia LeBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play the backwoods siblings. They only want to make an "honest" living, selling their moonshine at a fair price to people in their community, but when a crooked special deputy (Guy Pearce) demands a large cut of their action, the brothers refuse and that leads to violence, torture and murder.Adapted for the screen by composer Nick Cave from a novel (based on fact) by Matt Bondurant, grandson of the character played in the film by LeBeouf, LAWLESS features a cast of intriguing, multi-dimensional characters, portrayed by some of the most talented actors in films today. Jessica Chastain, as an emotionally damaged woman from Chicago who comes to work for the brothers, Mia Wasikowska, as a Mennonite girl courted by LeBeouf, and Gary Oldman, playing a big city gangster on the run, are also memorable in their rolesDirector John Hillcoat and his team have flawlessly re-created backwoods Virginia of the early 1930s. His action sequences are well staged and riveting.Unfortunately, the film does have several slow spots, caused by the fact that the screenplay lacks focus. Too much time is spent on two romantic subplots (i.e. LeBeouf/Wasikowska, Hardy/Chastain), which are, in themselves, touching, but these sequences distract from the primary storyline, the conflict between the brothers and Pearce's character. LeBeouf serves as the narrator of the movie and has top billing, yet the filmmakers never make clear whether this is his story or Hardy's.Anchor Bay Entertainment has issued LAWLESS in a 3-disc (Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital) combo pack. Extras include audio commentary by director Hillcoat and author Matt Bondurant, deleted scenes, a music video and several featurettes that discuss the real brothers and the making of the film.Michael B.

Constance Towers is a lady who exudes "class," which is a kind way of saying that she was really miscast in the role of a prostitute in THE NAKED KISS.In this 1964 release from writer-director Samuel Fuller, Ms. Towers plays a hooker who moves to a small town and decides to change her life. She goes to work as a nurse's aide in a hospital for disabled children and also, over a period of time, falls in love with the town's leading, wealthiest citizen (Michael Dante), who turns out not to be such a prize catch after all. Anthony Eisley plays a gritty local cop who knows her secret, and Virginia Grey is the madam of the local brothel, who doesn't have a "heart of gold".In its day, THE NAKED KISS was quite the shocker. It dealt with (or hinted at) such then-taboo subjects as prostitution, abortion and even pedophilia in bold ways that were foreign to American film audiences. Unfortunately, like many once-controversial movies, the handling of these topics are now so dated that, at times, they are almost laughable.The opening sequence with Towers beating up her pimp with her shoe, and an unexpected plot twist mid-film are still quite effective, but for the most part, the obviously low budget movie is filled with staid dialogue, performances and direction.Actually, the best part of this DVDs is not the movie, but the extras, a feast for fans of Sam Fuller. It features an engrossing, fairly recent on-camera interview with Ms. Towers, who looks terrific, and three lengthy documentaries about or interviews with Fuller.The film has received a new, high-definition digital transfer from Criterion.Michael B.

There's a lot to like about THE DEADLY COMPANIONS (1961), the first theatrical feature directed by Sam Peckinpah, but this gritty Western also has a fair share of problems...most of them stemming from it's low budget and a sluggish screenplay (by A.S. Fleischman) in which characters' motivations are not always credible.Brian Keith stars as a gunslinger who accidentally shoots and kills the young son of dance hall owner Maureen O'Hara. Despite her initial protests, he and his two desperado companions (Steve Cochran, Chill Wills) decide to escort her to an abandoned town in the middle of Apache territory where she plans to bury the boy next to his late father. Keith, however, has a hidden agenda. He plots revenge on one of the two men for an atrocity committed against him during the war between the North and the South.All four actors are excellent in their individual roles, particularly Wills whose part is atypical of the likeable, folksy characters for which he was best known. The desert vistas are nicely photographed, the story has a couple of interesting twists and Peckinpah's direction, although probably better suited for a television Western of the period, certainly portends of more impressive work to come.Sadly, the film's mediocre budget forces the action sequences to be limited and rather static, and in the night scenes, it is often difficult to discern who is on screen and what is happening.Nevertheless, THE DEADLY COMPANIONS should please Western fans...particularly those who are aficionados of Peckinpah.Strother Martin, a member of the director's "stock company," has a small, but amusing role, as a preacher.From VCI Entertainment.Michael B.

It still baffles me that this superb drama was not even nominated for a Best Picture Oscar the year it was released (1996). In my opinion, it was one of the finest films of that decade.Arthur Miller originally wrote his play, THE CRUCIBLE, to serve as an analogy for the House Unamerican Activities witchhunt that was then going on in this country. People may not have been condemned to hang back then, but lives and careers were being destroyed, often on the whims of the investigators and witnesses.The setting for the play and the film, adapted for the screen by Miller, is 17th century Salem, Massachusetts, where 19 people were actually hanged because they would not confess to being in league with the Devil.A group of teenage girls, led by Winona Ryder, meets in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony, but instead of love, Ryder wishes for the death of her former lover's (Daniel Day-Lewis) wife (Joan Allen). When the ritual is witnessed by the corrupt town minister (Bruce Davison), the girls are accused of witchcraft.To save themselves from being whipped, Ryder devises a plan that ultimately causes many members of the community, accused of consorting with Satan, to stand trail before judge Paul Scofield.Before this tribunal, proof is not necessary...merely an accusation by Ryder and her girls or any citizen, whatever their ulterior motives.When Allen is accused by Ryder, Day-Lewis takes on the court in an attempt to prove his former lover a fraud.This is a disturbing, frightening motion picture, mainly because this did happen and it can happen again.Nicholas Hytner directed. Jeffrey Jones co-stars.Michael B. Druxman

FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a totally predictable, albeit totally delightful, romantic comedy that succeeds thanks to a witty script, spry direction and a very likable cast.Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are "best friends" who each have had difficulty with past romantic relationships and want to avoid emotional pain in the future. Both, however, have their sexual needs, so they agree to become "friends with benefits"; sex partners without any emotional commitment. How this relationship is going to end up is obvious from the start, but the fun is in getting there.The supporting players in this film certainly contribute to make it special. Patricia Clarkson plays Mila's wandering mother, a fugitive from the 1970s who has not changed her ways and is unsure as to which of her myriad lovers fathered her daughter. Richard Jenkins is Justin's father, suffering from Alzheimer's, and Woody Harrelson is Timbelake's openly gay co-worker. Also in the cast is Emma Stone, Andy Samberg and Jenna Elfman.Director Will Gluck co-wrote the screenplay with Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, who along with Harley Peyton, developed the story.Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment audio commentary with Gluck, Timberland and Kunis, deleted scenes and outtakes.FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a terrific date movie.Michael B.

Michael Biehn writes, directs and stars in THE VICTIM, and does a credible job in all three areas.The low budget psychological thriller, which has a marvelous twist ending, has Biehn playing a recluse who lives in a remote cabin high on a mountaintop. One night desperate good time girl Jennifer Blanc (Mrs. Biehn in real life) comes pounding on his door looking for help. It seems that she and her friend (Danielle Harris) were partying in the woods with a couple of off-duty cops, and one of them accidentally killed the friend. Since she is the only witness to the crime, the crooked officers are after her...and now they are also knocking on Biehn's door.THE VICTIM is definitely "grindhouse" fare, but it is well done and quite entertaining. I do feel that the multiple flashbacks are an unnecessary intrusion to the forward movement of the story, but on the other hand, the film would have been too short without them.Potential viewers should be warned that the "R" rating is definitely deserved.Michael B.

Watching LUTHER, one thought kept coming to mind: If police in the UK were allowed to carry firearms, ninety percent of the killings that take place in this series could have been avoided.But, that's another subject altogether.LUTHER is an excellent, gritty cop show; a first-rate thriller that, in some respects, evokes memories of THE SHIELD. Both series deal with police detectives who work outside of the rules. The difference is that, with Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) of THE SHIELD, we're dealing with a "dirty cop," whereas in the case of John Luther (Idris Elba), we have a troubled officer who is forced to "dirty his hands" in order to get the job done.During the course of the one-hour series, the detective and his fellow officers deal with a number of very clever and cruel serial killers, and Luther must also contend with his wife (Indira Varma) from whom he is separated. Additionally, he has a very unusual relationship with Alice (Ruth Morgan), a highly intelligent murderess who has escaped prosecution because there is no viable evidence against her.That's as specific as I'm going to be about the plot of this series, which was created by Neil Cross. There are so many tense sequences and delicious surprises in these episodes that to say more would make me a spoiler.The actors are all superb in their individual roles. Indeed, Elba recently won a Golden Globe for his performance.I do, however, have a couple of reservations about some of the series' story arcs; caveats that sometimes strain its believability.Foremost, there is Luther's violent temper. When he gets angry, he breaks things, doors, windows and other inanimate objects, both at home and at work. I don't care how good a detective he is, with that kind of erratic behavior; I question why he is still on the force.Then, there's his relationship with Alice. Though Ms. Morgan is very attractive and a fine actress, I find that what the writers have her doing just not plausible. But, as a viewer, one goes along with it because the rest of the series does keep one on the edge of their seat.BBC Video has now released two seasons of LUTHER onto DVD. The first season contains six episodes, the second four. Each is a two DVD set.Michael B. Druxman

Western fans will rejoice over the long awaited release of THE FILMS OF BUDD BOETTICHER, a 5-disc set from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The films are five of the seven legendary westerns that director Boetticher made with Randolph Scott.Back in the days when I was a Hollywood publicist, Budd Boetticher was one of my clients.Budd was a very interesting man who told me many stories about his years in Hollywood. He was also very open about his self-destructive nature.At the time we were working together, he was talking about suing Universal Pictures over TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA, the 1970 Clint Eastwood/Shirley MacLaine western that was directed by Don Siegel. According to Budd. he'd sold the original story of that film to the studio with the proviso that he would also direct and Universal had reneged on that part of the deal. [I don't recall how the matter was resolved.]Budd also told me how he came to direct WESTBOUND (1959), a Warner Brothers film and the only one of the Boetticher/Scott movies that is not yet available on DVD."I offered to direct the movie for nothing," Budd said. "I wanted to protect my star."The last time I saw Budd was a couple of months before his death. I'd acquired a lobby card from THE TALL T, already signed by Scott, and I wanted Budd's signature on it also. The framed piece now hangs prominently on my living room wall.The TALL T (1957) is one of the films in this new set from Sony. Arguably, it is the best of the director's collaborations with Scott, who plays a down-on-his-luck rancher, taken hostage with Maureen O'Sullivan by Richard Boone and his gang. The outlaws had planned to hold up the stagecoach, but have instead decided to ransom the lady back to her wealthy father.Henry Silva co-stars in the Burt Kennedy-written film.Like THE TALL T, both RIDE LONESOME (1959) and COMANCHE STATION (1960) were both written by Kennedy and were filmed in the scenic Lone Pine area.Scott plays a much darker character in these films, as he did in DECISION AT SUNDOWN (1957).In RIDE LONESOME, co-starring Karen Steele, Pernell Roberts and (in his film debut) James Coburn, Scott plays a bounty hunter, bringing killer James Best in to be hung. However, before he can do that, he has to deal with marauding Indians, outlaws led by Best's brother and Roberts, an outlaw himself who by bringing in Best can get amnesty.COMANCHE STATION finds Scott rescuing Indian captive Nancy Gates and bringing her back to her husband, who has offered a reward. Again, in order to do this, he must fight even more Indians, plus baddie Claude Akins and his buddies, who want the reward for themselves.Both DECISION AT SUNDOWN and BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE (1958) are primarily set in a town. SUNDOWN has Scott in what is perhaps his most complex role. He rides into town to kill John Carroll, the man he hold's responsible for the death of his wife. But, Carroll "owns" the town and Randy soon finds himself holed up in the livery stable.Karen Steele, Valerie French and Andrew Duggan co-star in this one.In the light-hearted BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE, Scott arrives in a corrupt border town and finds himself in the middle of a blood feud. Craig Stevens co-stars.If you love westerns you will want to own this set, which also includes an excellent feature-length documentary about Boetticher.Michael B. Druxman

This may not be Al Jolson's best movie, but this very entertaining musical is certainly his most interesting.Directed by Lewis Milestone and featuring a pleasant score by Rogers and Hart, the film casts the legendary performer as the self-proclaimed "Mayor of Central Park," the happiest hobo in New York City. His life changes when he falls in love with beautiful amnesiac Madge Evans, who just happens to be the mistress of his friend, the city's playboy Mayor (Frank Morgan).What makes this film truly memorable, aside from Jolson's singing, is the script's rhyming dialogue and the character played by silent screen comedian Harry Langdon, who is consistently spouting statements that, in that Depression era, would definitely be considered "Red".Michael B.

THE TRAIN (1964) is a terrific nail-biting action/thriller that stars Burt Lancaster as the leader in the French Resistance who, with his small group of men, must stop a Nazi train that is attempting to remove his country's most valuable art treasures to Germany as the Allies approach Paris.Paul Scofield plays the fanatic Nazi Colonel who has devised the plan to steal these great works of art, arguing to his superiors back in Germany that they can be sold on the black market for funds to boost their losing war effort.What makes the film's two key characters genuinely interesting is that Scofield is a lover of art, whereas Lancaster, a common man, is willing to sacrifice his life and those of his men to save the paintings, even though he has no appreciation whatsoever of their beauty.Jeanne Moreau co-stars as a hotel owner who helps Lancaster avoid capture.There is a massive train wreck midway through this movie that is truly awesome.Besides director John Frankenheimer's audio commentary, the DVD includes a Music Only Track, highlighting Maurice Jarre's score.Michael B.

The Criterion Collection has released a handsome, restored, hi-def edition of CRONOS (1993), director Guillermo del Toro's first feature film.Shot mostly in Spanish, but partially in English (because co-star Ron Perlman did not speak Spanish), del Toro's screenplay offers an unusual take on the vampire movie.In 1535, an alchemist builds a fantastic mechanism that can give its user eternal life and houses it in a palm-sized golden capsule. The only problem is that, whoever uses this device becomes a vampire.A building collapse puts a stake through the alchemist's heart in 1935, but the device is nowhere to be found until it turns up almost 60 years later in a Mexican antique shop owned by kindly Federico Luppi, who lives with his wife (Margarita Isabel) and granddaughter (Tamara Shanath).Not realizing what he has discovered, Luppi accidentally triggers the device and is infected with the blood-sucking malady.But, that's not his only problem. It seems that the brutish Perlman has been sent to retrieve the device to help save his wealthy, dying uncle (Claudio Brook), and he will stop at nothing to get it...even murder.CRONOS is an intriguing, visually rich fantasy. For writer-director del Toro, it is a splendid preview of things to come.As the tragic, reluctant vampire, Luppi delivers a heart-wrenching performance, and Perlman is marvelously over-the-top as Brook's nephew and "hatchet man".Among the extras ion the DVD are two audio commentaries, one by del Torro and another by the film's producers, interviews with del Toro, Luppi, Perlman and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, a video tour of del Torro's home office and GEOMETRIA, an unreleased short horror film that del Toro started in 1987 and finished in 2010.Michael B.

On the surface, this black-and-white western from director John Ford looks like a "B" movie. It's long, often overacted and the direction is sloppy. Yet, because of its storyline and the forthright message that it conveys, the 1962 release is one of the most memorable films of Ford's illustrious career.James Stewart plays a well-meaning, albeit naive, lawyer from the East, who arrives in the small western town of Shinbone and immediately comes up against nefarious gunman Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Valance has been terrorizing the community with nobody around to stop him. In fact, the only man around capable of standing up to him is rancher John Wayne, but Valance has wisely avoided this confrontation.Stewart, however, pushes for justice. With the encouragement of waitress Vera Miles, who Wayne is also courting, and the help of newspaper editor Edmond O'Brien, he campaigns for statehood, which Valance opposes. Then, on one fateful night, violence erupts in Shinbone, and the non-violent Stewart must meet Valance in the street with a gun in his hand.This is the sort of moment from which legends are born, but if the true facts and the legend disagree, then as John Ford tells us, "Print the legend."It makes one wonder how much of the world's "official" history is more legend than fact.Michael B.

Eugene O'Neill's classic play, THE ICEMAN COMETH, was released in 1973 as the opening production of THE AMERICAN FILM THEATRE. It was directed by John Frankenheimer.The stellar cast included Fredric March, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges, Moses Gunn and Bradford Dillman.Set in 1913, the four-hour play centers around the down-and-out men and women who populate the New York skid row bar, owned by Harry Hope (March, in his final film role). They are awaiting the annual arrival of Hickey (Marvin), a salesman who jokes about his "cheating" wife, buys everybody drinks and perpetuates their false hopes and dreams.This year, something is different. Hickey is not only "on the wagon," but he's going to put each and every one of the barflies' dreams under a microscope and smash them.Robert Ryan, playing the philosophical Larry, steals the acting honors in this fine production, with March taking a close second as the saloon keeper who has not stepped outside the establishment for twenty years.Marvin makes an okay Hickey, but we'd much rather have seen Jason Robards repeat his legendary performance that he did both off-Broadway and on television's "Play of the Week".Nevertheless, this is a fine production that will be enjoyed by everyone who loves great theatre.Michael B.

In THE DESPERATE HOURS, Humphrey Bogart, returned to his signature bad guy roles after years of playing the world weary hero. Fredric March co-starred in this classic thriller, directed by William Wyler and based on a true story, which, in turn, was adapted into a hit stage play by Joseph Hayes.March plays the head of a happy suburban family whose household is invaded by by three vicious escaped convicts, led by Bogart.True, this kind of hostage drama is familiar television fare these days, but this 1955 film is still the best of them all. The movie holds up remarkably well, and the cast, which includes Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin, Robert Middleton and Gig Young, is superb.Michael B. Druxman

This 1957 release is never mentioned in the same sentence as HIGH NOON, THE SEARCHERS or SHANE, but like those classic films, it is one of the great westerns. It is also a much better picture than the 2007 remake that starred Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.Notorious, albeit charismatic, outlaw Glenn Ford and his gang rob the Butterfield stagecoach, killing the driver. Captured after he dallies for a romantic interlude with saloon girl Felicia Farr, Ford is then transferred to a nearby town to await the afternoon train to the Yuma prison. His guards are two paid volunteers, Van Heflin, a hard-working rancher who desperately needs the money, and the town drunk, Henry Jones.The suspense builds as Heflin and Ford hole up in a local hotel room, knowing that the outlaw's men will probably arrive to free their leader before the train stops and that Heflin will be no match for them.Delmer Daves directed this superb nail-biter that emphasizes character without sacrificing action, and which looks fantastic in black-and-white.Richard Jaeckel as Ford's chief henchman, Robert Emhardt as Mr. Butterfield and Leora Dana as Heflin's wife co-star. Frankie Laine sings the title song over the film's opening credits.Michael B. Druxman

As Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, Al Pacino delivers one of the finest performances of his career in this handsome, exquisitely-acted production of William Shakespeare's most controversial play.Jeremy Irons co-stars, playing Antonio, the Venetian merchant who borrows money from Shylock in order to help his friend, Bassinio (Joseph Fiennes), woo the fair and wealthy Portia (Lynn Collins). In order to secure the loan, Antonio pledges "a pound of flesh," should he not be able to repay the money on time, and when his fleet of ships are sunk, Shylock seeks what is legally owed to him.Despite the high quality of this film, the anti-Semitic aspects of Shakespeare's drama make it difficult to watch.Extras include audio commentary by director Michael Radford and Lynn Collins, plus a "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

I don't care if TITANIC won the 1997 Oscar for Best Picture.For my money, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL Is the best film to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years.This is prime film noir. In future history books of the cinema, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL will be ranked right up there with the great ones, such as DOUBLE INDEMNITY, OUT OF THE PAST and THE BIG SLEEP. And, as much as I admire and consistently enjoy those classic movies, I think that L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is the finest of the lot.Adapting James Ellroy's intricately-plotted, sometimes confusing, novel was certainly a monumental task for writer/director Curtis Hanson and his screenwriting collaborator, Brian Helgeland. Not only did they have to bring to life more than a half-dozen key characters, but there were also several intertwined plot lines to juggle.Hanson and Helgeland have done an admirable job. Their characters are real and, although the story is complicated, by the end credits, everything is explained. There are no loose ends. Truly, the movie is better than the book.Set in a superbly re-created 1950's Los Angeles, the film's primary storyline concerns the real reasons behind a mass murder in the Night Owl Cafe. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, three police detectives of widely different backgrounds and agendas, ultimately join together to battle police corruption, the Mob and, at times, each other. Along the way, they interact with some fascinating folk, including a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake (Oscar winner Kim Basinger), her rich pimp (David Strathairn) and the editor of a nasty scandal magazine (Danny DeVito).James Cromwell also co-stars as a police captain who is willing to break the rules.Michael B.

ON THE INSIDE may have some problems, but overall it is a pretty good thriller that boasts some excellent performances and many well-written scenes, one of which should have you jumping out of your seat. It did me.Evoking memories of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, albeit without the humor and a much more modest budget, writer-director D.W. Brown's film tells of a decent, but troubled young man (Nick Stahl), who is sent to a psychiatric institution for the criminally insane, only to find himself trapped when another inmate (Dash Mihok), a sociopath, leads a deadly escape attempt.Olivia Wilde and Pruitt Taylor Vince, as well as Stahl and Mihok, are quite impressive in their roles, yet the one major disappointment in this picture is the performance delivered by one-time Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo, ordinarily a very fine actress. In all fairness to Ms. Aghdashloo, her role as the head of the psychiatric facility is poorly conceived and written. She was unable to breathe any life into this cardboard character, nor was director Brown able to help her. Thankfully, her screen time in this otherwise entertaining movie is minimal.Anchor Bay Entertainment has released ON THE INSIDE in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.Michael B. Druxman

Writer-director Carl Colpaert's surreal Hollywood story, BLACK LIMOUSINE, has a lot going for it, including fine performances by David Arquette, Bijou Phillips and Tom Bower, as well as some nice camera work and intriguing visuals.On the other hand, it has a story that, like David Lynch's masterful MULHOLLAND DR., bounces in and out of reality, but the difference between this and Lynch's film is that when BLACK LIMOUSINE has ended, one does not really know what was real and what was a dream or a hallucination.Arquette plays a down-on-his-luck film composer, divorced and carrying the guilt that he may have been partially responsible for the automobile accident that claimed the life of his young daughter. Trying to pull his life together, he takes a job as a limo driver, attends AA meetings, and soon meets both a troubled actress (Phillips), with whom he wants to become romantically involved, and also an A-List actor (Nicholas Bishop), who just might be the key to reestablishing his music career.How much of this is actually happening or is just one of Arquette's flights into his fantasy world, we are never sure.That may be fine for some viewers, but not this one. I don't mind a somewhat ambiguous ending, but an utterly ambiguous picture is another animal altogether.On DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.Michael B. Druxman

In this unusual, quite effective 1976 thriller, Jodie Foster plays a 13-year-old who ostensibly lives with her poet father in an isolated house in a small rural community. However, we "know" early in the proceedings that the father is, in fact, dead and Jodie is surviving with the money he had put aside for her and by her own wits.Problems arise for the young girl when Martin Sheen, a known child molester whose indiscretions have been covered up by his wealthy mother (Alexis Smith), arrives on her doorstep and starts making advances toward her. Jodie is able to get rid of him, but he is determined to get what he wants and to also learn the girl's dark, deadly secret.There are several surprising plot twists in this Nicholas Gessner-directed gem, and Ms. Foster's final, lingering close-up is unforgettable.Michael B.

Roger Corman serves as an executive producer on DEATH RACE, a loose remake of his 1975 futuristic cult classic, DEATH RACE 2000. In fact, David Carradine, who starred in that earlier film, plays "Frankenstein" in the opening sequence of this version.Jason Statham stars in the 2008 release from Universal Studios Home Entertainment. He plays a former race car driver who is framed for the murder of his wife, so that he will be sent to the prison where the lucrative, nationally televised "Death Race" originates.Warden Joan Allen offers Statham his freedom if he will participate in the "kill or be killed" race.This picture is grounded much more in reality than the 1975 original, and if you can accept the film's outrageous basic premise, then you will find it to be very entertaining. The race sequences may be rather gory, but they are extremely well-staged.Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed the movie, which co-stars Tyrese Gibson and Ian McShane.The DVD features both the theatrical and an unrated version of the picture, with Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt delivering audio commentary on the unrated one. There are also two "Making of" featurettes.Michael B. Druxman

ENDURING LOVE (2004) is the most mesmerizing and unique psychological thriller that I've seen in some time.It begins with a tragedy. Daniel Craig and girlfriend Samantha Morton are picnicking in a field outside of London when they witness a freak, fatal ballooning accident. Craig and several other men tried to help prevent the death, but they were forced to let go of the balloon.Awhile later, Craig, who feels a certain amount of guilt about the accident, gets a visit from Rhys Ifans, one of the other men present on that tragic day. What Ifans wants of him is not immediately clear, but this strange man begins to stalk Craig, following him wherever he goes. Ultimately, Ifans' presence and his own growing feelings of guilt begin to destroy Craig's life, including his relationship with Morton.Directed by Roger Michell, this excellent film has a shocker of an ending.Michael B.

Adapted from the hit Broadway play, MAMMA MIA! is a captivating movie musical that makes you want to sing right along with the Benny Andersson/Bjorn Ulvaeus music and lyrics, based on the songs of Abba.In fact, one of the special features on the DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a Sing-Along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers.Meryl Streep stars as the independently-minded owner of a broken down hotel on a remote island in Greece. Her about-to-be wed daughter (Amanda Seyfried) does not know the identity of her father, since Mom was being romanced by three guys around the time she was conceived, so the young lady invites all three fellows to her wedding, signing Meryl's name to the invitation. None of them have any idea that they might be the bride's father.When Meryl sees the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) she just wants them to go away, but Amanda is not about to let that happen in this very fun, joyous musical comedy.Beautifully photographed under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, MAMMA MIA! has some terrific musical numbers, performed by Streep, Seyfried and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, who play Meryl's lifelong girl friends. Ms. Baranski is particularly delightful.The men are not really singers, but they try hard and, truthfully, none of their songs require a strong voice.Director Lloyd supplies audio commentary and there is also a deleted musical number.Michael B.

There was nobody like Errol Flynn. He was one-of-a-kind, a grown-up kid who, constantly looking for adventure, sailed through life on his good looks and innate charm.He was really a "flake". He avoided responsibility, usually letting his "little head" dictate to the one on top of his neck.No woman could hold him for very long.You'd be a fool to loan Errol money, as his creditors back in his native Tasmania would be quick to tell you. He spent that green stuff like there was no tomorrow.But, tomorrow did come and his last days were plagued with health and financial problems. He died at age 50.What remains for us to savor is his dashing, heroic on-screen image that will be forever young.I understand that this autobiography was ghost written, but Flynn certainly had a strong hand in writing it. The book has his wry, witty "voice" and is a very entertaining read.Michael B. Druxman

This is not your typical Civil War movie. Unlike other films about this dark time in America's history, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL deals with the war on a strictly local level, rather than the overall conflict.Here we have neighbors and long-time friends fighting a guerrilla war, murdering each other with the utmost sociopathic cruelty. There are no rules, no code of honor, thus even the innocent are slaughtered by the opposite side, just because they can be. War, according to director Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus, who adapted a book by Daniel Woodrell, robs men of their souls.In one sequence, for example, Tobey Maguire, who seems to be about the only member of the Bushwhackers who has a conscience, arranges for his former neighbor (Mark Ruffalo), a Union prisoner facing execution, to be released so that he can carry a message back to his superiors. Ruffalo returns the favor by immediately returning home and murdering Maguire's non-combatant father.Perhaps the most interesting character in the film is Holt, the former slave played by JeffreyWright. He is not fighting for any "cause," but to be with his childhood friend (Simon Baker) who bought him from his master and gave him his freedom. None of the other Missouri men are, in fact, really fighting for any reason other than hate and revenge.The battle scenes, particularly the raid on Lawrence, Kansas, are brutal and not for the squeamish.RIDE WITH THE DEVIL is an engrossing film with interesting characters, fine performances and some unexpected plot turns. My only problem with it is its length. For this Criterion release, director Lee reinserted approximately 14 minutes of footage that had been cut from the 1999 theatrical release.Lee, who has done an excellent job of recreating the Civil War era, is certainly a fine director, but those scenes were cut for a reason.Michael B.

This 1948 comedy was adapted from a Broadway musical that starred Mary Martin and featured a score by Kurt Weill. Sadly, the music, except for three songs, has been cut from the movie.The film, directed by William A. Seiter, is reminiscent of TOPPER, HERE COMES MR. JORDAN and other like fantasy-comedies that were popular with movie audiences during the 1930s and 40s.[During the 1960s, TV shows like BEWITCHED and I DREAM OF JEANNIE filled this void.]Robert Walker stars as a shy window dresser for a big department store, who impulsively kisses the store's invaluable statue of the Greek goddess, Venus. A moment later, the statue, played by Ava Gardner, has come to life and Walker faints on the spot.Upon awakening, poor Robert discovers that he's in very big trouble. He's being pursued by the cops for stealing the statute and, if that isn't bad enough, it appears that Venus won't return to her pedestal because she has fallen in love with him. Even worse, his jealous girl friend (Olga San Juan) is convinced that he's been unfaithful.Dick Haymes, Eve Arden and Tom Conway co-star in what is still a clever, if somewhat silly, romp that should entertain the entire family.Michael B.

This extremely well done 2-part television mini-series ostensibly relates the true facts about the tragic incident that occurred in August of 1992 when Federal agents, armed with rifles, choppers and tanks, surrounded the Ruby Ridge, Idaho, cabin of White Supremacist Randy Weaver, who had resisted a Federal arrest warrant.Following an 11-day stand-off that brought nationwide attention, both Weaver's wife and 14-year-old son were dead. Weaver, ultimately, surrendered, was tried on trumped-up murder and conspiracy charge and acquitted.Roger Young directed the film, which stars Randy Quaid as Weaver, Laura Dern as his wife and Kristen Dunst as their oldest daughter. Also in the cast are Diane Ladd, Bob Gunton and Joe Don Baker.The problem with this docudrama is that there is nobody in the story that you really want to root for. Yes, the Government abused their power in going after the Weavers with such deadly force. The deaths were certainly unnecessary; caused by some trigger-happy agents.On the other hand, the Weavers were, indeed, White Supremacists who followed Nazi doctrines. It is terrible that their family was destroyed and one can certainly grieve for them, but didn't they bring what happened upon themselves?Michael B. Druxman

THE FUGITIVE KIND is classic early Marlon Brando, who received a million dollar paycheck for his participation in this picture. The problem is that, watching this renowned actor at the height of his popularity, one can't help but feel that he is "doing a Marlon Brando clich&eacute;," rather than making the character of Valentine Xavier live and breathe.Part of the trouble is the script, which was freely adapted by Tennessee Williams and Meade Roberts from Williams' BATTLE OF ANGELS and its rewrite, ORPHEUS DESCENDING. Both versions of the play were unsuccessful during their New York engagements.This is not one of Williams' better plays. It contains no unforgettable characters like Blanche DuBois, Stanley Kowalski or "Big Daddy," and its ending is a downer. Actually. most of Williams' plays have unhappy conclusions, but in most cases, when Hollywood brought them to the big screen, the endings were, arguably, more upbeat. That is not the case with this independent 1960 production.On the other hand, even a less than superb Tennessee Williams play has it's poetic moments that mesmerize, such as Brando's scene in which he tells about the little bird that flies on the wind and only touches earth when it dies.Masterfully directed (within the confines of the script) by Sidney Lumet, THE FUGITIVE KIND is a morose drama that crackles with several fine performances, in particular those of Woodward as a lost soul crying for help and Magnani as a woman who has been forced to keep her strong emotions pent up inside for all of her life.Michael B.

I have love-hate feelings about cgi.I love the fact that this fantastic computer process allows filmmakers to create new worlds and tell epic stories that were previously difficult, if not impossible, to present on motion picture and television screens.On the other hand, I hate the fact that directors and cgi artists tend to overdo these effects in their movies, often to the detriment of good storytelling.This recent release from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. The movie is enhanced with a good basic story, likable performances and many sensational scenes that make for an overall enjoyable viewing experience. Yet, this film could have been much more than it is had the filmmakers restrained themselves by not throwing everything but the proverbial kitchen sink into their action sequences.For example, the picture contains a car chase through densely populated city streets. The sequence is well-staged and quite exciting, except that it seems to go on forever with one cgi generated stunt after another.Memo to Filmmakers: Enough already! Less is More.WANTED is adapted from a series of comic books and tells of a shy junior accountant (James McAvoy), recruited into the Fraternity, an ancient secret society of assassins dedicated to killing people who will put the world into chaos. McAvoy's long lost father was killed while working for the group, and now James has been selected to destroy the rogue member of the Fraternity who murdered him.Morgan Freeman plays the mysterious leader of the Fraternity, who has his own secrets, and Angelina Jolie is McAvoy's trainer and partner.Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, WANTED is filled with sensational cgi stunts, many of which strain believability.Michael B.

THE FOUR FEATHERS, A.E.W. Mason's epic adventure novel, has been filmed on several occasions, most recently in 2002, but this British-made 1939 production, directed by Zoltan Korda, is certainly the best of them all.John Clements plays the British soldier in Queen Victoria's army who resigns from his regiment shortly before it is to be sent to the Sudan to capture the city of Khartoum. Branded a coward by both his friends and fiance', he ultimately disguises himself as a Sudanese native and sets out to rescue his former comrades.The action sequences in this Technicolor production are nothing short of fantastic. Ralph Richardson, C. Aubrey Smith and June Duprez co-star.This new high-definition digital restoration of the film from The Criterion Collection contains audio commentary by film historian Charles Drazin, as well as a new interview with David Korda, son of the movie's director, A DAY AT DENHAM, a short film from 1939 featuring Zolton Korda on the set of THE FOUR FEATHERS, the theatrical trailer and an essay by film critic Michael Sragow.Michael B.

THE TIN STAR (1957) is a superb, character-driven drama that is the equal of such classics as HIGH NOON and SHANE.Directed by Anthony Mann, the black-and-white film stars Henry Fonda as a former sheriff, now a bounty hunter, who rides into a strange town with a dead outlaw on his pack horse. While waiting to collect the reward, he befriends the young, inexperienced sheriff (Anthony Perkins) and agrees to teach him how to do his job in a way that will, hopefully, keep him alive.Events come to a head when a respected citizen is murdered and a lynch mob, led by Neville Brand, comes after the jailed killers. If he is to keep his job, Perkins must stand up against this town bully.Betsy Palmer, Michel Ray and John McIntire co-star.Michael B. Druxman

Mention MOULIN ROUGE and most folks will think of Nicole Kidman and the ground-breaking 2001 musical in which she sang and danced to perfection.However, back in 1952, there was another (non-musical) MOULIN ROUGE, and most people who remember this John Huston-directed classic consider it to be one of the greatest films of that decade.It also produced a title song that has become a standard.Huston's film received seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. It won for Art Direction and Costuming, but lost the top honor, as did HIGH NOON and THE QUIET MAN, to Cecil B. DeMille's THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH. [Go figure!]Visually stunning, MOULIN ROUGE stars Oscar-nominated Jose Ferrer as both famed artist Toulouse-Lautrec and his father.A dwarf, Lautrec believes that he is too ugly to ever attract a woman, thus he devotes his life to painting and cognac. A fixture at Paris' infamous turn-off-the-century Moulin Rouge nightclub, he meets and falls in love with a streetwalker (Colette Marchand), who breaks his heart. Later, he is unable to recognize true affection from another woman (Suzanne Flon).Zsa Zsa Gabor co-stars as a singer at the nightclub who also has romantic problems. Future Hammer horror icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee have brief roles.MGM/UA Home Entertainment has done a commendable job in transferring this color-rich film onto DVD.Michael B. Druxman

THE HOUR, the six-part one-hour mini-series from the BBC that was a recent Golden Globe nominee, is really two shows in one.On the one hand, it's the story of the launching and day-to-day operation of a revolutionary one-hour topical news show by the BBC and, in this guise, it seems to literally "borrow" its three principal character from the 1987 movie, BROADCAST NEWS. Indeed, the characters played by Romola Garai, Dominic West and Ben Whishaw may have British accents, but they mirror the roles inhabited by Holly Hunter, William Hurt and Albert Brooks in the earlier film.But, THE HOUR, which was written and created by Abi Morgan, is also an engrossing mystery, involving political intrigue, murder, Russian spies and assassins from MI-6.Set during the 1950s in the middle of the Cold War and just as the Suez crisis erupts, The Hour begins with Romola being assigned to produce the experimental news program, which will have the handsome, well connected, but not quite ready for prime time West as its anchor. Also on staff is Romola's platonic best friend, Whishaw, a maverick reporter who had hoped to get West's job.Problems arise for the trio not only when Government representatives attempt to influence the show's coverage of the Suez events, but also when Whishaw begins an independent inquiry of two murders, one of the victims being an old friend of his who had come to him for help. His investigation leads him some very high places and some shocking revelations.The fine cast of this well-written series includes Anna Chancellor, as a veteran reporter of foreign affairs, Oona Chaplin (Charlie's granddaughter), as West's wife, daughter of a prominent family and Anton Lesser, who oversees the news department.THE HOUR is available on DVD from BBC Video.Michael B.

This television remake of a minor 1947 John Wayne western classic not only suffers from the fact that star Lou Diamond Phillips is not the "Duke," but also from a script and direction that is definitely subpar.Phillips is a good actor, as is his co-star, Deborah Kara Unger, but attempting to step into boots previously worn by a movie icon like Wayne is always a mistake.The basic story about a wounded gunman who is taken in and reformed by a Quaker family is also viable, but writer Jack Nasser and director Terry Ingram, who shot their picture during a Canadian winter, do not seem to understand the western genre. The dialogue is staid, the pace and action sequences are static and the movie is, frankly, dull.The DVD contains a "Behind the Scenes" featurette.Michael B. Druxman

THE ICE HARVEST is a clever bit of film noir with a goofy touch. Harold Ramis directed.John Cusack stars as a Mob lawyer who is, otherwise, a very nice guy. Along with the more sinister Billy Bob Thornton, he steals over two million dollars from his boss (Randy Quaid), then has to wait out the night until he and Thornton can make their escape.Unfortunately, Quaid and his enforcer (Mike Starr) get wind of the theft, which creates other complications.Richard Russo and Robert Benton's script, adapted from Scott Phillips' novel, keeps the tension high but doesn't forget the humor. Indeed, there are some hilarious sequences in this film, particularly one that involves a bad guy locked in a trunk and another that features a very drunk Oliver Platt, who nearly steals the movie.Connie Nielsen is quite good as the movie's femme fatale.DVD extras include audio commentary by Ramis, two alternate endings, some interesting production featurettes and a laugh-out-loud outtake with Cusack and Thornton.

I imagine that there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of books written about the art and craft of storytelling. Indeed, I have even written one myself.The interesting fact about books on writing/storytelling is that, if the author knows what he's talking about, then all of these books really say the same thing.They just say it in the author's unique voice.Anthony C. Patton definitely knows what he's talking about, and his voice is certainly unique.Drawing inspiration from revered philosophers and the "story gods," Patton carefully examines each aspect of the various elements that are necessary in the creation of a great story. Then, in four individual chapters, he analyzes a quartet of relatively recent movies (BLACK KNIGHT, COLLATERAL, SCHOOL OF ROCK, SIDEWAYS), illustrating how these different elements were utilized in those films to come up with a solid story.In sum, THE WORLD AS STORY is an excellent "how-to" book for the aspiring screenwriter, novelist or short story writer.Michael B.

Truthfully, I had never heard of this movie until the night of the Emmy Awards when it won almost every category for which it was nominated. And, after watching the film, I must say that it certainly deserved every one of them.Claire Danes delivers an amazing performance as the real life autistic woman who has become one of the top scientists in the humane handling of livestock. Julia Ormond is equally touching as her patient mother, as is Catherine O'Hara, cast as her loving aunt, and David Strathairn, as the high school science teacher who mentors the young woman, encouraging her to use her unique gifts to achieve her goals.TEMPLE GRANDIN is unlike other films that deal with mentally challenged individuals (e.g. RAIN MAN, FORREST GUMP) in that it does not make its central character a comic figure. Ms. Danes and director Mick Jackson take us into the often-frightening world of the autistic, letting us see (as much as possible) the literal way that they think.Perhaps the most emotionally moving scene takes place at the end of this film when Temple and her mother attend a convention for parents of autistic children. Observing another mother's frustration with her child's behavior, Temple stands up and explains to the woman and the crowd what it is like to be autistic. If you haven't been using it already that is the moment where you will definitely need to have your box of Kleenex handy.A short "Making of" featurette on the DVD gives us the chance to meet the real Temple Grandin.From HBO Video.Michael B.

During the 1930s, the charming dancer Jessie Matthews was known as the "Queen of the British musical". She was to the British cinema what Eleanor Powell was to American movie audiences.Unfortunately, for a various reasons, this talented performer never worked in Hollywood films, and her delightful musicals have not been made available on DVD to audiences in the USA...until now.As part of their Rank Collection, VCI Entertainment has released Ms. Matthews' FIRST A GIRL (1935), which, years later, served as the basis for Blake Edward's VICTOR/VICTORIA starring Julie Andrews.FIRST A GIRL is a fun, extremely entertaining movie with some enjoyable songs (e.g. "Everything's In Rhythm With My Heart"). The dance numbers are also quite spectacular, sort of Busby Berkeley light.Matthews is marvelous as the young woman, who pretends to be a man in order to play a woman on stage, where she is a major nightclub star, and her real-life husband, Sonnie Hale, doing the Robert Preston role straight, is also excellent. Griffith Jones and Anna Lee are cast in the parts done by James Garner and Lesley Ann Warren in the remake, but in this early version, they are simply very rich people, rather than an American gangster and his moll. Victor Saville directed.VCI has done an excellent job of restoring this movie, and it looks great.Michael B. Druxman

HARRY BROWN is a vigilante movie that might best be described as "a British version of DEATH WISH or GRAN TORINO".Viewers who are turned off by excessive violence and harsh language should avoid this film, but if you're the kind of person who, like me, cheers when a low-life criminal gets his, then this is the movie for you.Michael Caine stars as Harry Brown, a retired British Marine and widower. He lives in a gang and drug-infested housing project. The police seem to be powerless, even after Brown's only friend, also an elderly gent, is brutally murdered by the gang. Shortly thereafter, one of the thugs tries to rob Harry who, using his long dormant military training, kills the man, and then runs off.At that point, Harry decides to come out of retirement and, single-handed, kill the gang members and drug suppliers that have destroyed his neighborhood. Despite his advanced age, he does it very well.Michael Caine, one of the finest (still working) film actors of his generation, is magnificent as Brown, and Emily Mortimer is excellent as an emotionally-torn police detective who suspects that Brown is the vigilante eliminating gang members, yet is sympathetic to his position.Daniel Barber directs efficiently and Gary Young has delivered a taut screenplay with good dialogue, although he does tend to rely on coincidence a but too much during the last third of this, otherwise, quite entertaining movie.Michael B.

Marilyn Monroe has been portrayed many times on the screen, but never as sensitively or believably as with Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, now available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.Indeed, Ms. Williams becomes Marilyn to the point where one forgets that one is watching a movie about Marilyn Monroe and believes that that is the real person up on the screen.The film, directed by Simon Curtis, is based on a memoir by Colin Clark that details his experience as a 3rd assistant director on the troubled film, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, which starred Monroe and Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), who also directed that 1956 release. Marilyn was newly wed to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) when she traveled to London for the first time in order to make the picture, and the playwright was having a difficult time dealing with her neuroses. When he took a brief trip back to New York, Clark (Eddie Redmayne) was conscripted by Marilyn for a week to be her emotional support.The casting of the movie is letter perfect. I can imagine no other actor than Branagh as Olivier and, as with Williams, he quickly makes you believe that you are actually watching the legendary British actor in person. Redmayne is very likable as the young novice Clark, as are Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Julia Osmond as Vivien Leigh.MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a charming, thoroughly entertaining film that not only give viewers a realistic look at a nostalgic era of movie-making, but also an insider's viewpoint of some of that time's most revered figures.Michael B.

Errol Flynn may have top billing in this epic adventure drama, based on a book by Rudyard Kipling, but his is only a secondary role.Dean Stockwell is the central character in the story of a young British orphan who, in order to avoid going to school, pretends to be a street urchin in Colonial India. His protector is Red Beard (Flynn), a horse trader who is also a key operative in British espionage activities against rebel forces that are being backed by the Russians.Also in the cast of the Victor Saville directed film is Paul Lukas, playing a holy man who Stockwell comes to revere, and Robert Douglas as the head of the British Secret Service.There's plenty of action and, though his role is somewhat brief, Flynn is, thankfully, Flynn.Michael B.

WITHOUT A CLUE (1988) is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I love this movie!That said, I have to wonder why this inventive spoof of Sherlock Holmes was not a huge box-office success when it was first released. Certainly it has garnered a cult following over the years, but the mass audience has never really embraced it.Perhaps the reason is that Sherlock Holmes appeals to a more intellectual viewer and one needs, at the very least, a basic familiarity with Conan Doyle and the Baker Street sleuth in order to appreciate the humor (often slapstick) in this Thom Eberhardt-directed film.The basic premise of the script, written by Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther, is brilliant. In their scenario, there is no Sherlock Holmes. He is a fictional character, created for Strand Magazine by genius detective Dr. Watson (Ben Kingsley).The Holmes stories were so popular that people came to believe that Sherlock was a real person. Thus, Watson hired an out-of-work actor (Michael Caine) to play the role of Holmes while he did the actual detective work. Unfortunately, the actor is also a drunk, a gambler, a womanizer, a coward and an absolute moron.As much as Watson would like to get rid of the imbecile, he's stuck with him...particularly when the evil Professor Moriarty (Paul Freeman) appears on the scene, planning the crime of the century.This one is laugh-out-loud funny.Michael B.

Fox has released a terrific 3-disc box set, THE WESTERN CLASSICS, in which we're finally getting a DVD version of one of the most revered westerns ever produced, THE GUNFIGHTER (1950) starring Gregory Peck.Directed by Henry King in glorious black-and-white, THE GUNFIGHTER is almost a Shakespearean tragedy, and is considered to be the first adult western, predating better known films like HIGH NOON and SHANE.Peck plays Jimmy Ringo, a notorious gunfighter who would like to bury his reputation, but is forced to keep on the run because young punks keep forcing him to draw.Currently, he's being pursued by the three brothers of a braggart he killed in self defense, but he stops off in the small town where his estranged wife (Helen Wescott) lives, hoping for a reconciliation. The sheriff of the town happens to be Millard Mitchell, an old friend and former gunslinger.Mitchell wants Peck to leave town, but he won't go until Westcott agrees to meet him. In the meantime, the three brothers are getting closer and, if that's not bad enough, there's a young hothead in town (Skip Homeier) who thinks he's a faster draw than the legendary Jimmy Ringo.THE GUNFIGHTER may not contain a lot of shoot-'em-up action, but it's filled with a HIGH NOON-like suspense and colorful, multi-dimensional characters. Karl Malden and Jean Parker co-star.DVD extras include a featurette on cinematographer Arthur Miller, an artist with black-and-white, and a retrospective "Making of" mini-documentary.Almost as good as THE GUNFIGHTER is RAWHIDE (1951), another beautifully-photographed black-and-white western, directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward and Hugh Marlowe.Marlowe and his band of ruthless outlaws (Jack Elam, Dean Jagger, George Tobias), all escaped convicts, take control of a desert stagecoach station, run by Edgar Buchanan and his tenderfoot assistant (Power). They kill Buchanan, then hold Power and stage passenger Hayward (and her baby niece) hostage, waiting for a gold shipment to arrive by coach the next day.Power knows that, once the outlaws have the gold, they will kill their captives, so he and Hayward desperately devise a plan to thwart their intentions.RAWHIDE is another suspense-filled western, containing a fair share of surprise plot twists.DVD extras include featurettes on Ms. Hayward and on Lone Pine, where RAWHIDE, THE GUNFIGHTER and many other classic westerns were shot.Hathaway, Hayward and Marlowe are also involved in GARDEN OF EVIL (1954), the one disappointing film in this box set.Shot in CinemaScope and color, the movie features some gorgeous and interesting Mexican scenery and boasts a cast that also includes Gary Cooper, Richard Widmark, Cameron Mitchell and (briefly) Rita Moreno.The problem with GARDEN OF EVIL is the very talky script, which has its characters doing things that make little or no sense.Cooper, Widmark and Cooper play three Americans on their way to the California Gold Rush by ship, who get stranded in a small Mexican coastal town and are hired by Hayward to help free her husband (Marlowe) from a mine cave-in. The problem is that the mine is located deep in the mountains in Apache territory.DVD extras include a retrospective "Making of" featurette and a mini-documentary on director Hathaway.Michael B.

Watching THE OTHER GUYS, I was reminded of a story told to me many years ago by legendary screenwriter John Lee Mahin:He had just finished writing the script for MOGAMBO (1953), the African adventure movie that starred Clark Gable and Ava Gardner.Gable approached him one day and he was angry, "You son-of-a-bitch," he said. "You've given Ava all of the funny lines.""That's right," Mahin replied, "but the audience isn't going to laugh until they see your reaction."That's one of the basic rules of comedy.There always has to be a straight man.Would Lou Costello have been funny without Bud Abbott?Would Jerry Lewis have gotten all those laughs without Dean Martin (or somebody like him) to play off of?That's the problem with THE OTHER GUYS.Almost everybody in it wants to be the comic, even the actors who usually play more serious roles (e.g. Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg). Nobody is doing the Bud Abbott or Dean Martin part, and the result is that most of the attempted humor just lies there. It's simply not funny.The basic story premise, which is actually pretty good, centers on a pair of misfit NYPD detectives (Will Ferrell and Wahlberg), sentenced to life behind a desk, who stumble onto what might be the "crime of the century". In their own inept ways, they attempt to solve it.In all fairness, there are some very funny moments in this movie, such as the scene in which Ferrell and Wahlberg play "bad cop and badder cop" or when Ferrell sends messages to his wife (Eva Mendes) through her mother. Unfortunately, these scenes are few and far between.Ferrell is, without doubt, a skillful comic performer, but there is little chemistry between him and the film's other actors, and so much of the movie, particularly the action sequences, is so far over-the-top that it just comes off as stupid, not even amusing.Perhaps the underlying problem with this picture is that writer (with Chris Henchy)-director Adam McKay was never sure what kind of comedy he wanted to make. At times, it seems like he was trying for another AIRPLANE, while at other moments the picture looks like a misguided effort to do an action/comedy "buddy" movie (e.g. 48 HOURS).That's another rule of comedy. Pick your style and stick with it.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains both the theatrical and an extended version of the movie, as well as a couple of "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, deleted and extended scenes.Michael B.

After he made ONE, TWO, THREE (1961), James Cagney retired from the screen and turned down all offers to return for twenty years. He even refused the choice role of Alfred Dolittle in the movie version of MY FAIR LADY.The film that brought Cagney back to the movies was RAGTIME (1981), the adaptation of E.L. Doctorow's best selling novel.Set in 1906, RAGTIME interweaves the story of a fictional upper middle class family (Mary Steenburgen, James Olson, Brad Dourif) living in Upstate New York, with the lives of some real-life figures, such as Evelyn Nesbitt Thaw (Elizabeth McGovern) and Booker T. Washington (Moses Gunn). Cagney, whose role is relatively small, is (as always) effective as the corrupt New York police commissioner.The main plotline concerns Coalhouse Walker (Howard E. Rollins, Jr.), a black musician who turns vigilante when the authorities refuse to correct a grievous wrong done to him and his fiance' (Debbie Allen).Also in the first-rate cast is Mandy Patinkin, playing a European immigrant who becomes one of the first film directors, Donald O'Connor and Cagney's lifelong friend, Pat O'Brien.Directed by Milos Forman, RAGTIME is a terrific picture than does a superb job of recreating a bygone era.DVD extras include audio commentary by Forman, a retrospective featurette and a deleted scene featuring the real-life character of activist Emma Goldman.Michael B.

Jill Clayburgh delivered the most memorable performance of her career as a divorced woman in this poignant 1978 drama from writer-director Paul Mazursky.At the beginning of the film, Jill is a reasonably happy wife and mother, married to successful stock broker Michael Murphy. However, her life is shattered when Murphy suddenly announces that he is in love with another woman and wants a divorce.Single again after seventeen years, Jill spends several weeks trying to redefine herself. She dates, engages in some one-night stands and, ultimately, meets artist Alan Bates with whom she falls in love. Now, she must decide whether to make another romantic commitment, or to enjoy her newly discovered feeling of independence.This is, arguably, Mazursky's finest work. He and Ms. Clayburgh supply audio commentary on the DVD.Michael B. Druxman

As much as I enjoy both the 1953 and 1997 films, TITANIC, certainly the most engrossing telling of this 1912 tragedy at sea can be found in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, the 1958 British motion picture, adapted from the book by Walter Lord and directed by Roy Ward Baker.Eric Ambler's screenplay adaptation is no "soap opera". It unfolds like a semi-documentary. There are characters in the picture that we come to care about, but unlike other films about the Titanic, none of them are more important than the ship, the event that took place on that fateful night in the North Atlantic and some revealing insights on how the disaster could have easily been prevented.No need to discuss the plot any further. I'm not being a spoiler when I tell you that the ship sinks. Now, get over it and let's move on.Among the better known cast members are Kenneth More, Honor Blackman, David McCallum, Alec McCowen and George Rose.The Criterion Collection has released a fine 2-disc DVD set of A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, featuring a stunning new digital restoration of the black-and-white film. Aside from audio commentary by Titanic historians Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, extras in this set include a 60-minute "Making of" documentary, a half-hour Swedish documentary featuring interviews with Titanic survivors, a 50-minute BBC documentary, "The Iceberg That Sunk the Titanic," and a 24-page essay-filled booklet. However, for this writer, the most moving extra is an archival 1990 interview with survivor Eva Hart, who lost her father in the disaster, and has vivid memories of that terrible night.Michael B.

Macy, Morgan Freeman and Christopher Walken are honest security guards in an art museum, but when they learn that their three favorite artworks are being transferred to a museum in Denmark, they concoct a plan to switch the real masterpieces with fakes.It's the blind leading the blind as these incompetent thieves put their plan into motion and, according to "Murphy's Law," anything that can go wrong, does in this laugh-out-loud comedy.Marcia Gay Harden co-stars as Walken's wife, who has a "surprise" coming her way before the movie's finish.DVD extras include director/writer audio commentary, a "Making of" featurette, deleted scenes and bloopers.Michael B.

"Never remake a hit movie; only a flop. Otherwise, you will always be competing with the memory of the original film."That's a basic canon of Hollywood moviemakers that seems to be increasingly ignored these days. Remakes of SABRINA, 3:10 TO YUMA and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL are just three relatively recent examples that prove the viability of that rule.Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the original 1990 version of TOTAL RECALL, directed by Paul Verhoeven, and which is, in this writer's opinion, one of the best science-fiction movies ever made. (A small caveat: I am not a big fan of science-fiction movies. There are a very few that I like.)Now, TOTAL RECALL has been remade, this time starring Colin Farrell with Len Wiseman directing.Though the original is a better film overall, this new action-thriller will certainly entertain viewers, particularly those who have not seen the 1990 film. It does, however, make some essentially cosmetic changes to the storyline of Verhoeven picture, including combining two key characters into one.Set near the end of this century when most of Earth in uninhabitable, this version of the Philip K. Dick short story ("We Can Remember It For You Wholesale") has Farrell playing Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who visits Rekall, a company that can turn his superspy fantasies into real memories. But, when the procedure goes terribly wrong, the line between fantasy and reality blurs. Quaid discovers that his life is an illusion. He becomes a man on the run; the only person alive who can save the lives of half the planet.Where this 2012 picture betters the original version of TOTAL RECALL is in its masterful use of CGI special effects, which were not available when the 1990 film was made. Indeed. Wiseman and his crew have created a marvelous futuristic world that evokes and even betters memories of movies like BLADE RUNNER and MINORITY REPORT. The action sequences are exciting and the performances from the talented cast (Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy) are first rate.Unfortunately, Wiseman has allowed the action sequences and superb visual effects to overshadow story and characterization, which results in his film being less compelling than its predecessor.As previously stated, if you haven't seen the Schwarzenegger version of TOTAL RECALL, you will definitely enjoy this unnecessary remake much more than I did.Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has made TOTAL RECALL available in 3 and 2 Disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs, as well as a single disc DVD edition. All three choices include extras (e.g. gag reel, "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, etc.).Michael B. Druxman

LOOPER is one of the most intriguing and entertaining science-fiction movies that I've seen in some time. My wife describes it as "THE TERMINATOR Meets THE OMEN," but that simple depiction really doesn't do justice to this multi-layered, well thought out action thriller, written and directed by Rian Johnson.The story is set in the not too distant future when time travel has been invented, but is forbidden and is only available on the black market. When the Mob wants to get rid of somebody, they send their victim thirty years into the past where a hit man (or "looper") is waiting to kill him.Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper, getting rich off his kills and looking forward to retiring in France. Then, one day, the Mob decides to "close the loop," sending back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) for assassination. The older Joe, however, has other plans.Johnson's film is totally original in its concept; filled with colorful characters and many unexpected story twists. I don't want to be a Spoiler, thus I am not going to reveal further plot details. Bottom line: If you enjoy films that deal with time travel, or just good storytelling then I cannot recommend LOOPER too highly.Willis and Gordon-Levitt are excellent, as are the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Piper Perabo and Jeff Daniels.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains many extras: Feature commentary by Johnson, Gordon-Levitt and Blunt, two "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, deleted scenes and more.Michael B.

THE PROWLER (1951) was one of the long unseen Holy Grail's of film noir until the Film Noir Foundation and the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored it a few years ago in a joint effort.At first glance, THE PROWLER might appear to be another knock-off of classic noirs in which an adulterous couple murders the lady's husband. But, this one is somewhat different.Evelyn Keyes plays a lonely housewife who calls the police when she sees a prowler peeking in her window. One of the cops who takes the call is unscrupulous Van Helfin, and he, almost immediately, decides that he want s this woman...particularly when he discovers that her husband is quite wealthy.Unlike similar themed films like DOUBLE INDEMNITY, it is the man, not the woman, in this story who is the evil one. While she cheats on her husband, Keyes is also a victim of the predatory Heflin, and although he is definitely the villain of the piece, he is certainly not your typical black-and-white heavy. Indeed, his is a well-rounded character who if, at times, he doesn't evoke our sympathy, does induce our understanding.The performances are exquisite. Heflin, one of the finest actors of his day, is at the top of his game, and Ms. Keyes proves that she is capable of playing a much more complex character than Scarlett O'Hara's youngest sister or Al Jolson's wife.The screenplay by blacklisted Dalton Trumbo (using a "front") is first-rate, as is the direction by also blacklisted Joseph Losey.Among the extras on the DVD from VCI Entertainment is an excellent documentary featurette about the "making of" the movie, which includes interviews with James Ellroy, Alan K. Rode and Trumbo's son, Christopher.Michael B. Druxman

On its surface, A SEPARATION may be about the dissolution of a marriage, but it is really a superb low-key thriller.The Iranian-made picture, which won the 2011 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, was produced, written and directed by Asghar Farhadi.Set in contemporary Iran, the film begins with the wife, Simin, wanting to leave the country with her daughter, Termeh, but meeting resistance from her husband, Nader, who refuses to leave his Alzheimer-suffering father. The judge refuses the divorce, but Simin moves out of the house anyway.With Simin gone, Nader hires a young married woman to stay with and care for his father while he is working. However, after Nader comes home one day to find the caretaker gone; his father tied to his bed and unconscious, emotions and events escalate to the point where the lives of all parties are put into jeopardy and changed forever...not necessarily for the better.A SEPARATION is an engrossing drama with some surprising story twists. It is filled with exquisite performances from a remarkable Iranian cast.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment includes audio commentary by director Farhadi, plus two featurettes, "An Evening with Asghar Farhadi" and "Birth of a Director".Michael B.

Penelope Cruz and Ben Kingsley star in this elegantly understated May-December love story, adapted from a Philip Roth novel by Nicholas Meyer and directed by Isabel Coixet.Kingsley is a middle-aged college professor and cultural critic who is unable to sustain a lasting romantic relationship, despite his many conquests, nor does he have a meaningful connection with his doctor son (Peter Sarsgaard).He's been involved in a comfortable, uncomplicated twenty-year affair with a successful businesswoman (Patricia Clarkson), but when he meets student Penelope, he loses his heart to her to the point of obsession. Despite their vast age difference, she also falls deeply in love him.The problem, however, is Kingsley's inability to commit to her or anyone else but, when tragedy strikes, the professor finds himself reevaluating his values.This is a fine film that is enhanced by its good writing and exquisite performances, particularly by Kingsley and Ms. Cruz who has never been better. Dennis Hopper co-stars as Kingsley's closest friend, a poet.The DVD contains audio commentary by Meyer and a "Making of" featurette.Michael B. Druxman

"SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS MEETS REVENGE OF THE NERDS" might be the best way to describe this charming college comedy.Amanda Bynes stars as adorable tomboy Sydney White, a plumber's daughter who goes to a top college on scholarship and, because her late mother was a member, is a legacy to that school's most popular sorority.Unfortunately, that sorority and the student council is run by the wicked Sara Paxton, who takes an instant dislike to Sydney and sabotages her chance to get into the Greek organization.Virtually homeless on campus, Sydney is taken in by seven "dorky" guys who reside in a broken down house on campus that Paxton wants to have condemned. Now, Sydney and the seven dorks devise a plan to unseat Paxton from her queenly position.Joe Nussbaum directed this very likable movie, which co-stars Matt Long as the handsome "Tyler Prince".DVD extras include deleted scenes, a gag reel and several "Behind the Scenes" featurettes.Michael B.

THAT EVENING SUN is one of those marvelous "little" pictures that usually gets lost in the shuffle because it's too little. On the other hand, if one is lucky enough to catch it, the film stays with them forever.Hal Holbrook, in what is perhaps the finest performance of his stellar career, plays Abner Meecham, a crusty old coot who escapes from his retirement home and returns to his farm, only to discover that his adult son (Walton Goggins) has "sold" it to a family that the octogenarian considers to be `white trash".Meecham, however, is a proud, stubborn man, so he moves into the sharecropper's cabin across from the main house, buys a barking dog for company and lays "siege" to the intruders. It is just a matter of time before events turn very ugly.Adapted to the screen by director Scott Teems from a short story by William Gay, THAT EVENING SUN is filled with well-defined characters of varying shades of gray. Meecham may, indeed, be the hero of the piece, but he is definitely a flawed hero, just as his antagonist (Ray McKinnon), for very brief moments, can evoke our sympathy.The ending to the story is now what one would expect.Mia Wasikowska, Carrie Preston, Barry Corbin and Holbrook's late wife, Dixie Carter, are effective in their various roles.Michael B. Druxman

Since many motion pictures, including "classics," produced in the early 1930s make somewhat ponderous viewing today, it's always pleasing to watch a movie from that era which retains its full entertainment value. ISLAND OF LOST SOULS (1932) is one of those pleasing films.Based on THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU by H.W. Wells, ISLAND is greatly enhanced by an understated performance by Charles Laughton, playing a "misguided" doctor who, on a remote island in the South Seas, performs ghastly experiments in which he turns jungle animals into sub-human beings.Richard Arlen, shipwrecked, is dumped by an unscrupulous sea captain on Laughton's isle, and is horrified by what he finds there. Indeed, the doctor plans to mate him with his panther woman (Kathleen Burke), thus producing the first human-animal child. Also in the cast is Bela Lugosi, cast as the grotesque leader of Laughton's macabre creations, who ultimately leads a rebellion against him.Directed by Erle C. Kenton from a literate screenplay by Phillip Wylie and Waldemar Young, this suspenseful, atmospheric production moves at a lively clip and seems much shorter than its 70 minute running time. It's one of the very best horror films of the period.ISLAND OF LOST SOULS has, surprisingly, never been released (legally) onto DVD until now, but for its debut, The Criterion Collection has given it a first-rate treatment. Aside from a new high-definition digital restoration of the uncut theatrical version and audio commentary by film historian Greg Mank, extras include a new video conversation among director John Landis, make-up artist Rick Baker and genre expert Bob Burns, new interviews with horror historian David J. Skal, filmmaker Richard Stanley and members of the band Devo., a short film by Devo, a still gallery, the theatrical trailer and a booklet featuring an essay by writer Christine Smallwood.Michael B.

There are no murders or car chases in CLASS ACTION (1991), directed by Michael Apted, but this is certainly one of the best courtroom dramas that I've ever seen.The key characters, played by Gene Hackman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, are not only father and daughter, but they are also opposing counsel in a multi-million dollar class action lawsuit against an automobile manufacturer. Gene has a small law firm that has a sterling reputation for winning "David and Goliath" litigations, and Mary Elizabeth works for a major San Francisco law firm that doesn't always play by the rules.Father and daughter don't really get along, primarily because she resents that fact that he used to cheat on her mother. Mom has long ago forgiven her husband, but when she dies suddenly, there is no longer anybody to intercede between the two. Then, Mary Elizabeth's bosses start cheating during the trial, destroying documents to which Hackman's side is entitled, and she must decide which side she is really on.Hackman and Mastrantonio are superb.Michael B.

HOODWINKED (2005) was an animated feature; a revisionist history that retold the story of LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, RASHOMAN-style.Questioned by the police, Red, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf and the Woodsman all tell different, but parallel stories about the events that took place at Granny's cottage, painting a remarkably different picture than what children have read about for generations.It was a clever, albeit silly, movie that evoked a few chuckles from the grown-ups, but delighted the small fry. Some of the songs were very clever.The picture ended with Red, Granny and the Wolf joining the super secret Happily Ever After Agency (HEA), a group that exists to insure that fairy tales have happy endings.HOODWINKED TOO! HOOD vs EVIL (2011) has just been released by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.The story pretty much picks up where the original left off. Red is in training with a covert group, Sisters of the Hood, when HEA calls her in to handle a case.It seems that two children, Hansel and Gretel, have been kidnapped by a wicked witch, and Red, Granny and Wolf are assigned to rescue them.As with the first film, I liked the songs, smiled a few times, but I would have enjoyed the proceedings much more if I was ten-years-old. HOODWINKED TOO! HOOD vs EVIL is definitely a picture for kids.Glenn Close (Granny), Patrick Warburton (Wolf) and David Ogden Stiers (Detective Flippers) repeat their voice roles from the original, while Hayden Panettiere takes over from Ann Hathaway as Red and Martin Short replaces Jim Belushi as the Woodsman. Other voice talents in this one include Bill Hader (Hansel), Amy Poehler (Gretel) and Joan Cusack as the witch.Extras include three music videos and some "Behind the Scenes" featurettes.Michael B.

In all fairness, I must admit that, with certain exceptions, I am not a fan of horror movies or television series.I am even less a fan of the "zombie" movie. Frankly, I think they are silly. [Sorry, George Romero.]On the other hand, I love a well-written, intelligent script...even if it is in the horror genre. Good writing is good writing, no matter where you find it.THE WALKING DEAD may have been adapted from a series of graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, and there are plenty of zombies walking around and feasting in the thirteen-episode second season, but these decaying creatures take a back seat to the compelling human dramas that are played out between the survivors.Because we, as an audience, come to care about these multi-dimensional characters, several of whom do not survive the season, when the zombies (aka: "walkers") do attack they are anything but "silly". They are truly frightening.Viewers who enjoy blood, guts and gore will not be disappointed, but unlike most zombie movies, that's not what this series is about. In THE WALKING DEAD, story and character trump visceral delights.I am not going to give specific plot details, except to say that this season not only finds the survivors taking refuge on a remote farm, populated by a veterinarian (Scott Wilson), his daughters and some neighbors, but there is also a deadly insurrection brewing within the core group.All of the performances in the show are superb, as are the Georgia-filmed series' visual effects, make-up and other elements. This is a first-rate production.My chief concern about the program's future is: How long can the creators successfully continue the basic premise without resolving it?Most shows of this ilk (i.e. ones with one continuing story line) run out of steam after a season or two and are better suited as "limited series." Hopefully, the producers will not allow this excellent series to overstay its welcome.The four-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes many extras, "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, webisodes and deleted scenes.Michael B.

WRITER'S BLOCK is one of the most unusual and intriguing mystery stories that I've ever read.Essentially, it's the story of a new (fictional) musical-comedy, from its first read-through to when it becomes a smash hit on Broadway. But, on opening night, there is a tragedy. One of the show's creative team has died in a fire. Was it an accident, or was it murder?There are a couple of elements in this book that make it unique. I'm not going to tell you what they are, because then I would be a spoiler.The book is a quick read, a real page-turner. Author Bruce Kimmel has not only created a first-rate mystery, but he also gives you an entertaining look at the world of theatre and the people who populate it.Indeed, part of the fun is trying to guess the identities of the real people were the inspiration for his true-to-life characters.Michael B.

Aside from the title, several songs and the shipboard setting, this 1956 adaptation retains little of Cole Porter's hit Broadway musical. In fact, there are several new tunes in the film written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn.That's not to say that this isn't an entertaining movie, because it is. It has a likable cast, an okay story and the musical numbers are all first-rate. Among the Porter tunes in the film are "You're the Top," "I Get a Kick Out of You, "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" and, of course, the title song.Bing Crosby and Donald O'Connor are Broadway song-and-dance men who are about to star in their first show together. On separate vacations in Europe, each one signs a different leading lady for the show. Crosby, having spotted Mitzi Gaynor on stage in London, has given her the role, while O'Connor, in Paris, has signed an iron-clad contract with dancer Jeanmarie. Now, who is going to tell one of the girls that she's fired?The situation becomes more complicated when Donald falls for Mitzi and Bing does likewise with the French lady.Phil Harris co-stars.

Humphrey Bogart made very few comedies during his long career, but those that he did appear in were quite entertaining.WE'RE NO ANGELS (1955) is a delicious black comedy, adapted by Ranald MacDougall from MY THREE ANGELS, a popular French play by Albert Husson, and directed by Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA). In it, Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray play three convicts who have escaped from the prison on Devil's Island on Christmas Eve.While planning their departure from the island itself, they take refuge in a store run by a kind couple (Leo G. Carroll and Joan Bennett), who are being terrorized by Carroll's nasty uncle (Basil Rathbone), the store's owner. Bogart and his two companions, with the help of their poisonous pet snake, decide to improve the couple's lives by seeing that ol' Basil and his equally villainous nephew don't bother them any longer.Michael B.

Although it starts out a bit slowly, LOST EMPIRES soon becomes a thoroughly engrossing mini-series that takes viewers back to a world that no longer exists; the world of the British Music Hall in the months before World War I.The British Music Hall is akin to America's vaudeville, both of which declined as the popularity of the upstart motion picture industry grew. The "Empires" of the title not only refers to the decline of the United Kingdom's influence in the world, but also the Empire Theaters in the UK that served as the venues for variety performers to do their acts. Indeed, one of the most memorable aspects of the production is the superb recreation of this era.Adapted from a novel by J.B. Priestly, the 7-part series follows the adventures of Richard Herncastle (Colin Firth), a young man from a rural village. After the death of his parents, he joins the popular traveling variety act of his magician uncle, Nick (John Castle), a nasty fellow who treats all women as "tarts" and seldom has a nice word to say about anybody.Richard's new colleagues are an assorted bunch of singers, dancers, acrobats, jugglers and comedians, including one (Laurence Olivier in a marvelous performance), whose best days are far behind him. During his months with the company, the young man falls in love, has several illicit affairs, including one with an older woman that ends with violence, and even becomes involved in a backstage murder case.Gillian Bevan, Carmen Du Sautoy, Beatie Edney, Patricia Quinn, Brian Glover, Pamela Stephenson and Jim Carter play key roles in this 1986 production, directed by Alan Grint.Taking into account the age of this television series, the quality of this 3-disc DVD set from Acorn Media is fine.Michael B.

20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment has now released BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, Season Six, onto DVD in a 6-disc/22-episode boxed set.Though series creator Joss Whedon's special brand of humor is still present, this season's episodes have a much darker edge to them than shows in previous seasons. Indeed, this is certainly the most compelling BUFFY season thus far.The stand-out episode is, without question, "Once More, With Feeling," a delightful one-hour Broadway-style musical in which the entire cast either sings or dances. Then, there's "Normal Again," which places Buffy in an alternate reality. It's a great premise which, in this writer's opinion, should have been the basis for the series finale.Since Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) "died" at the end of Season Five, the initial episodes of this season deal with her resurrection, courtesy of a black magic spell cast by best friend Willow (Alyson Hannigan).Buffy's back, but there's something different about her. It's so different that she even begins a torrid affair with nasty, albeit psychologically neutered, vampire Spike (James Marsters). Additionally, Buffy is forced by a lack of finances to get a low level job and also has to deal with the fact that that sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), has become a shoplifter.Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and his former-demon girl friend, Anya (Emma Caulfield) continue their romance to a heart-breaking climax in the "Hell's Bells" episode, and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) spends much of the season back in England.The chief villains this season are three geeks who have caused Buffy problems in previous seasons and have now decided to become the crime lords of Sunnydale. Sadly, their moronic schemes result in multiple tragedies, causing a grief-stricken Willow to try to destroy the world via black magic.Among the many DVD extras is the A&E; series overview.Michael B.

THE RESIDENT is an okay, rather creepy thriller that is given a touch of class by having Oscar-winner Hilary Swank in the leading role.The plot structure is reminiscent of SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (1992), as well as other "women in jeopardy" movies.Having broken up with her cheating boy friend, Swank, a New York emergency room doctor, moves into a spiffy renovated apartment in a very old building, and soon has the feeling that she is not alone.She isn't, but that's all I'm going to tell you about the plot because I don't want to be a Spoiler. Let's just say that we learn the culprit's identity fairly early in the proceedings, thus for the remainder of the film, we're hoping that Ms. Swank will find out what we know before it's too late.Directed by Antti Jokinen and co-starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Christopher Lee, the final twenty minutes of this one will wreak havoc on your fingernails.THE RESIDENT is from Hammer Films, released onto DVD by Image Entertainment.Michael B.

The Rizzos are a family with secrets.Head of the household Vince (Andy Garcia) works as a prison corrections officer, but his secret wish is to become an actor. Rather than confiding his dream to his wife, Joyce (Julianna Margulies), he tells her that he plays poker once a week, but he is really taking dramatic lessons.Vince also has another, darker secret. He has an adult out-of-wedlock son, Tony (Steven Strait), conceived prior to meeting Joyce. Because Tony's mother was a "psycho bitch," he abandoned the boy before birth, but now discovers him to be a "resident" in his prison.Vince's legitimate kids also have their problems. Daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) lost her college scholarship and now, unknown to her parents, works as a stripper. Son Vince, Jr. (Ezra Miller), on the other hand, skips school regularly and has a "thing" for grossly overweight women.So that the young man can get an early parole, Vince decides to bring Tony into his home. [Neither Tony nor Vince's family knows that Vince is Tony's father.] About the same time, encouraged by his acting partner (Emily Mortimer) who has her own secrets, Vince auditions for a major film and his clandestine behavior convinces Joyce that he is having an affair.Further misunderstandings in the household bring all secrets out into the open.Written and directed by Raymond De Felitta, CITY ISLAND is a warm, joyful comedy about a dysfunctional family that finds its way "home".Like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and UP IN THE AIR, this is one of those original comedies where the people and their emotions are real. There are no "jokes," yet we laugh at the humor of the situations because, though the specifics might be different or less dramatic, we are laughing at the parallels to our own lives.The dialogue is quick and witty, and performances by the entire cast are superb.Perhaps the funniest scene in the picture belongs to Alan Arkin, cast as Vince's acting coach, who at one point rants about how he hates actors who use "pauses" in their work. It is a laugh-out-loud moment.CITY ISLAND is endearing; one of the best, most entertaining pictures I have seen this year.Michael B. Druxman

Determined to retake the crown, he swaps places with a look-alike commoner then, in a roundabout way, journeys back to Paris.The plan is that, once Napoleon is in Paris, the double will reveal the deception and the leader's former followers will then flock to his support. Unfortunately, the fake Napoleon likes his new luxurious lifestyle and refuses to carry out his end of the bargain.The real Bonaparte, in the meantime, must learn to live the life as a commoner, but he soon uses his brilliant skills as a military tactician to help a young widow turn her failing business into a thriving one.Ian Holm is a delight as both the real and phony Napoleon in this witty and thoroughly entertaining film, directed by Alan Taylor.Michael B.

SINNERS AND SAINTS is the kind of movie that irks me.It irks me because it's a pretty good cops-and-robbers action movie that, with a little more attention to the screenplay, could have been a hell of a lot better.Despite the fact that there were a couple of moments where I wasn't quite sure who was shooting at who, William Kaufman knows how to direct an exciting action sequence. Indeed, these scenes are the best part of the picture.And, the story also starts out to be pretty compelling, as two New Orleans detectives, played by Johnny Strong and Kevin Phillips, begin investigating a series of gruesome murders in which the victims were burned alive. It's soon discovered that the key to solving the mystery rests with a childhood friend of Strong's (Sean Patrick Flanery), a mercenary recently returned from the Middle East.Where the movie goes awry is in its second half. Suddenly, characters start doing things that seem to have no motivation except for the fact that either the director or screenwriter commanded it. Even the well-staged action sequences in the latter part of the picture fall flat. They appear to be there for their own sake, rather than furthering the story.There also seems to be a never-ending supply of disposable bad guys whose only purpose in the movie is to show up, shoot hundreds of bullets at the hero, then get killed. Their on-going presence reminds me of the ads for a 1950s science-fiction movie: "Kill One and Two Take Its Place!"The cast, which includes Kim Coates and Tom Berenger in cameo roles, is competent, and the film provides many views of New Orleans not often seen on screen.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes some deleted scenes.Michael B.

NEW FACES is not really a "movie".Although it did play in theaters back in 1954, the picture is more of a filmed record of NEW FACES OF 1952, the hit Broadway revue from which it's adapted. The film's producers have added a slight framing story, but what is on the screen is, essentially, a series of musical numbers and skits strung together, performed by the original cast.What made this stage production so memorable is that it was the vehicle that launched the careers of such stellar talents as Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Paul Lynde, Carol Lawrence, Alice Ghostley and Ronny Graham, as well as Mel Brooks, who wrote several of the skits.Frankly, with the exception of a sketch inspired by DEATH OF A SALESMAN that features Paul Lynde as a "Willy Loman" who makes his living as a pick-pocket, time has not been kind to the comedy skits in NEW FACES. What might have been funny back in 1954 falls flat today.On the other hand, most of the musical numbers are still delightful, particularly "Santa Baby" and "Monotonous," performed by the sultry Ms. Kitt, "I'm in Love with Miss Logan" (Clary), "Penny Candy" (June Carroll) and the melodic "Love Is a Simple Thing" (Carroll, Clary and Kitt). However, my personal favorite is "Lizzie Borden," performed by most of the cast. It's a tune that I find myself often humming to myself.This new widescreen version of NEW FACES from VCI Entertainment has been digitally remastered and is the best available on DVD.Michael B.

ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE may be somewhat historically incorrect, but it is still a fascinating, extremely entertaining epic motion picture.Why many of the nation's critics, aside from Cate Blanchett's superb performance, didn't like it, I have no idea. Either they have no idea what they're talking about, or I have absolutely no taste whatsoever. Indeed, there's no other possible explanation.Blanchett, who may very well be the finest actress working in films today, and Geoffrey Rush reprise the roles they first played in ELIZABETH (1998). This time out they're joined by Clive Owen, cast as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Stuart.As in the earlier film, also directed by Shekhar Kapur, this picture is filled with of court intrigues, plus a plot by the Spanish Government and Mary Stuart to assassinate the Queen, all of which culminates with a huge sea battle and the defeat of the Spanish Armada.On a more personal level, the movie deals with Elizabeth's romantic feelings toward Raleigh and her anger when she learns that he loves another.Rhys Ifans, Jordi Molla and Abbie Cornish co-star in this excellent historical thriller.Michael B.

I've always felt that, with the exception of THE GODFATHER TRILOGY, this Sergio Leone-directed epic is, by far, the best of the modern gangster films. Butchered by the distributors upon its initial release, the movie was later restored to its nearly 4-hour length and form. It is this extraordinary version that is now available on DVD."I brought back the key to your clock," says aging hood Robert DeNiro to childhood friend, "Fat Moe" (Larry Rapp), and thus begins a journey into memory. Set to the haunting music of Ennio Morricone, the picture moves back-and-forth in time as the guilt-ridden DeNiro unravels a mystery that has plagued him for more than 35 years."You can always tell the winners at the starting gate," he tells Moe, as he contemplates his wasted life. "You can always tell the winners...and the losers."ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA views the experiences of a group of Jewish mobsters, headed by DeNiro and James Woods, who prosper in New York during Prohibition. We first meet them as teenage hoodlums; follow their colorful, violence-filled exploits into adulthood, until one fateful night that changes all of their lives forever.Elizabeth McGovern is DeNiro's childhood sweetheart, an aspiring actress who, though she loves him, realizes that this is a bittersweet romance that can never be. Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Joe Pesci and Danny Aiello round out the well chosen cast. Leone, incidentally, has also done a remarkable job in recreating and photographing New York of the 20s, 30s and 60s.The tragedy of this engrossing film is that, because of its misconstrued first release, it was passed over in 1984 for Oscar consideration. It certainly would have been a prime candidate for Best Picture.The 2-disc DVD includes audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel and a documentary on Leone.Michael B. Druxman

They don't make black comedies much funnier than HAROLD AND MAUDE (1971).In director Hal Ashby's cult classic starring Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort, Cort is a rich, lonely young man with a dominating mother who enjoys faking his own suicide, while Gordon is a 79-year-old mischief-maker, who will do just about anything that strikes her fancy.Could any two people be more perfect for each other?Cort's bogus suicide attempts are sidesplitting hilarious; the funniest moments in the movie.The Criterion Collection has released a new "Special Edition" of HAROLD AND MAUDE, featuring a new digital restoration and an optional remastered stereo soundtrack. It also includes audio commentary by Hal Ashby biographer Nick Dawson and the film's producer, Charles B. Mulvehill, plus illustrated audio excerpts from seminars by Ashby and writer-producer Colin Higgins, and a new interview with songwriter Yusuf/Cat Stevens.Finally, the set contains an essay-filled booklet that includes a profile on the late Ms. Gordon and interviews with Court and others connected with the picture.Michael B.

The producers of NETWORK (1976) might disagree, but BROADCAST NEWS (1987) is the perhaps the most realistic and entertaining portrayal of the television news business that Hollywood has ever produced.Written and directed by James L. Brooks, this smart film is, at its core, a romantic comedy, set in a Washington D.C. news bureau and centering around three key characters.In her star-making role, Holly Hunter plays a obsessive-compulsive news producer, who must always be in control. She s being romantically pursued by her closest confident, Albert Brooks, a nerdy, cynical, but very capable news reporter, and the not-too-bright William Hurt, a handsome, sexy, up-and-coming anchorman, whose ethics she detests.Which one will win her heart?Also in the cast are Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and, in an amusing cameo role, Jack Nicholson.The Criterion Collection has released a superb new 2-disc edition of BROADCAST NEWS, featuring many exciting extras, including an interesting alternate ending and several intriguing deleted scenes that feature a colorful character that was cut from the final movie. Other extras include audio commentary by director Brooks and film editor Richard Marks, a new documentary about Brooks' career, a featurette about the CBS News producer who served as a model for Hunter's character, on-the-set footage and interviews with the stars, plus an accompanying booklet about the picture.Despite its topical content, BROADCAST NEWS holds up very well.Michael B.

This is perhaps the best book about screenwriting and the film business ever written.Oscar winner William Goldman, who wrote such classic films as HARPER, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, MARATHON MAN and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN shares his unique, often difficult, experiences working with top directors, producers and stars like Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier.If survival in the Hollywood film industry is possible, then there is no better "survival guide" than this book, because Goldman tells it like it is. He pulls no punches.According to Goldman, the single most important fact in the movie industry is that "Nobody Knows Anything".Most of the book's second-half is a primer on how to write a successful screenplay.What does Goldman feel is the most important lesson to be learned about writing for films?1. "Screenplays Are Structure"2. You protect the "spine" of that structure "to the death".If you want to work (and succeed) in Hollywood, then this is a book that you must carry around with you...like a Bible.Michael B. Druxman

MAN HUNT (1941) has one of the most unforgettable opening sequences in movie history.The year is 1939. Renowned British big game hunter Walter Pidgeon moves quietly, swiftly through a Bavarian forest, avoiding sentries. Soon, he reaches the edge of a cliff, assembles his long-range rifle and takes careful aim at his prey.In his cross-hairs is Adolph Hitler.Naturally, Pidgeon is thwarted before he can pull the trigger. He is beaten and taken before Gestapo leader George Sanders, who promises him freedom if he will confess to being an assassin, sent to kill Hitler for the British Government.Almost by accident, Pidgeon escapes and is able to make his way back to England. He is followed by Sanders and several of his henchmen, including John Carradine, who still want him to sign the false confession that will embarrass the Brits and put the country in a difficult political position.One of the few people willing to help Pidgeon is Joan Bennett, a "street waif". [She was probably really a prostitute, but that would go against the strict 1941 Production Code.]Adapted from a novel by Geoffrey Household and directed by Fritz Lang, MAN HUNT is a taut thriller that plays like an urban version of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. It is filled with the director's signature images of foreboding dark corners and shadowy streets.The sharp black-and-white release from 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment has audio commentary by author Patrick McGilligan and a "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

Director Sidney Lumet's BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD was one of the very best pictures of 2007, and it's a shame that it was ignored during the Academy Awards. Certainly the script, direction and performances were much better than in many of the films that were honored.A melodrama in the best sense of the word, the New York-based film, written by Kelly Masterson, tells of two brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) who are desperate for money. They decide to solve their problem by holding up a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store, an easy target. The problem is that the store owners are the boys' parents (Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris) and, during the robbery, actually carried out by Hawke's buddy, something goes terribly wrong.Now, the brothers have to not only cover their tracks because Finney is determined to find the guilty party, but they must also deal with a blackmailer.The climax is both shocking and violent, as everything for the brothers seems to spin out of control.Marisa Tomei co-stars as Hoffman's wife, who just happens to be having an affair with Hawke, and Amy Ryan plays Ethan's former spouse.Michael B.

Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are an unmarried couple with problems who, after she refuses his marriage proposal, seem to be heading for a break-up. Following a friend's wedding, they spend the night at Speedman's family's summer home, but soon after arriving they are terrorized by three masked strangers, apparently intent on killing them.This thriller from writer-director Bryan Bertino grabs your attention from the start and keeps you perched on the edge-of-you-seat, biting your fingernails right up until the final 10-15 minutes when it takes a wrong turn, not only forgetting one of the basic rules of good storytelling, but also giving us a downer ending.[I thought downer endings for this kind of picture went out in the 1970s.]The DVD contains both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie, plus deleted scenes.Michael B.

Adapted from Harry Brown's novel by Robert Rossen and directed by Lewis Milestone, this 1945 release is one of the finest films ever made about World War II.Dana Andrews stars as a sergeant in charge of a group of American infantrymen who land on the beach at Salerno, then trek across the countryside to a Nazi-occupied farmhouse that they've been ordered to destroy.The writing in this picture is almost poetic as we explore the minds of each of the men who only want to come through this relatively minor battle alive.The stellar cast includes Richard Conte, John Ireland, Lloyd Bridges, Sterling Holloway and Norman Lloyd, who has been interviewed for this DVD that contains a restored, un-cut version of the movie.Joel Blumberg also contributes an interview, "The Men of A WALK IN THE SUN"Michael B.

If it hadn't been for THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, 12 ANGRY MEN would certainly have swept the 1957 Academy Awards. It is truly one of the "great" films.Set almost entirely in a jury room, this highly-charged Sidney Lumet-directed/Reginald Rose-written drama concerns the deliberations of a murder case in which a teenager is accused of killing his father. Eleven of the jurors are convinced that the defendant is guilty, but the twelfth has doubts and must steer the others toward his conclusion.The virtual all-star cast features Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, Edward Binns, John Fiedler, Robert Webber, George Voskovec, Joseph Sweeney and Jack Klugman.The Criterion Collection has now released a 2 DVD set of 12 ANGRY MEN that contains some fabulous extras. Aside from a new high-definition digital restoration, there are archival interviews with Lumet, a new interview with screenwriter Walter Bernstein about the director, plus several other interviews with industry professionals about the film's history and the artists who made it. There is also a booklet containing an insightful essay by law professor Thane Rosenbaum.However, the two choice extras in this set are a pair of vintage dramas from the days of live television. Written by Reginald Rose and directed by Lumet, "Tragedy in a Temporary Town" aired in 1956 and stars Lloyd Bridges.Even more exciting is the inclusion of the original 1955 television version of "12 Angry Men," directed by Franklin Schaffner. Considered "lost" for decades, this one-hour drama stars Robert Cummings, Franchot Tone, Edward Arnold, John Beal, Norman Fell and both Joseph Sweeney and George Voskovec, who repeated their roles in the movie.Today, compared to the 1957 film, this production is really a curio that often aptly illustrates the pitfalls of live television. Indeed, at one point, the bulky TV camera intrudes into a scene. Nevertheless, it is fascinating to see what is, essentially, a "first draft" of a classic.Michael B. Druxman

DEADWOOD was one of HBO's finest series and was certainly the best western television series ever produced. It had a compelling storyline based on actual events, fascinating true-to-life characters, gritty, realistic production values and the most X-rated dialogue ever heard on the tube.When the show was suddenly cancelled after the 3rd season without giving the story or characters a proper conclusion, viewers were not just upset. They were angry.Now, HBO Video is trying to make partial amends by releasing DEADWOOD, THE COMPLETE SERIES, a 19-disc box set that not only contains all 36 episodes of the series, but also a Bonus Disc that has series creator David Milch strolling through the DEADWOOD set and talking about how he would have ended the series had there been a 4th season.Like the rest of the series, most of that final season would have been based on actual historical events and would have included a huge fire that destroyed the town.Also on the extra disc is a documentary about the real Deadwood after the fire, plus a hilarious audition reel featuring series regular Titus Welliver.Michael B.

HUNT TO KILL stars Steve Austin as a U.S. Border Patrol agent, stationed in the rugged wilderness of Northern Montana and living with his rebellious teenage daughter.A group of fleeing, murderous thieves take them hostage and force Austin to lead them through treacherous backwoods across the Canadian border. Knowing that it is only a matter of time before these fugitives, led by Gil Bellows, will kill them, Austin draws on his survivalist training in order to bring them down, one-by-one.Some stunning scenery and a several terrific stunts, including a couple in which Austin (or his double) take a dive off a perilous cliff, can't save this film from a terrible script that, despite the efforts of some talented actors, presents its villains as cardboard cartoon-like characters whose actions make no sense whatsoever. And, in the end, we have another one of those unbelievable chief heavies (Bellows) who just won't die...even though he's being continually battered and broken by Austin, who is twice his size.The unfortunate thing about this film is that, had director Keoni Waxman and the writers taken the time to flesh out their heavies and make their actions more believable, this could have been a pretty good little movie. Certainly all of the production values were present.Michael B. Druxman

As presented on stage, A.R. Gurney's popular play features an actor and actress seated at a table, reading a series of letters that describe their lifelong relationship. In fact, during the height of its popularity back in the early 1990s, Los Angeles audiences were treated to an ever-changing cast of stars, each pair staying with the production for a week or so, then relinquishing the stage to another duo.For this 1999 television adaptation under the direction of Stanley Donen, Gurney opens up his play somewhat. True, most of it takes place in one room, with the two principals speaking the contents of their letters to each other, but this approach, surprisingly, works very well.Steven Weber plays a U.S. Senator who has just attended the funeral of his friend, Laura Linney. Alone in his office, he begins to read the letters that they wrote to each other over the years, and Linney's spirit appears to deliver her half of the communications, thus the scenes play as a dialogue.The two characters had met in grade school where they immediately fell in love. However, the fact that Linney was a rebellious, free-spirited girl, while Weber was more serious and down-to-earth, kept them from consummating their romance, except for a brief affair. Both married others, yet each was the great love of the other's life.The actors are terrific in one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I can't recommend this one too highly.Michael B. Druxman

In I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978), aspiring novelist Camille Keaton rents a house in the country one summer and is soon raped, beaten and left for dead by four local thugs. She recovers but, instead of going to the law, decides to get her own just, ghastly revenge on the quartet.The movie contained a considerable amount of graphic nudity, and both the rape and revenge sequences were quite brutal and realistic. Of course, during the revenge sequences, one felt like cheering every time Ms. Keaton dispatched one of her attackers.Steven R. Monroe directed the 2010 remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, which stars Sarah Butler, who does quite well in the Keaton role.Though the heroine's methods of revenge in this version are much more brutal, the screenplay follows the general plot of the 1978 picture. It does add one key character, who I won't talk about lest I be a Spoiler, but the addition of this character certainly makes the story more intriguing.There is still some graphic nudity in 2010 version, but not as much as there was in 1978.Extras on this DVD include director and producer (Lisa Hansen) commentary and a "Making of" featurette.There are a many extremely dark and disturbing scenes in this version, which some people will not be able to watch. Still, if you could sit through the SAW movies, I guess that I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE will not be too much of a problem.Michael B. Druxman

Anna Faris proves herself to be the "Marilyn Monroe" of this generation in a cute, heart-warming comedy about a Playboy bunny, who is ejected from Hugh Hefner's mansion the day after she turns twenty-seven, because she's too old. Actually, this wasn't Hef's doing, however we don't learn that until halfway through the picture.Anna is a sweet girl, but definitely not the brightest bulb in the chandelier. Her only goal in life is to become a Playboy centerfold.On the first day on her own, she finds herself homeless and, because of a misunderstanding, spends a night in jail.Her life changes when she stumbles onto UCLA's sorority row and becomes the house mother of the sorriest sorority on the block. She teaches the girls how to attract guys, and they teach her how to win a guy...hopefully, for keeps.Fred Wolf directs. Colin Hanks and Emma Stone co-star.Michael B. Druxman

This film has a stellar cast, many of whom are adept at playing comedy.But, this is not a funny movie.The basic story premise has the potential to be a marvelous farce, but the script is mundane and the director has no sense of comedy timing.The only bright spot in the picture is Cesar Romero, who steals every scene that he's in. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to get much help from his fellow players.My guess is that Sinatra and Martin owed another picture to Warner Brothers, so they did this one to get rid of the commitment. Why else would they agree to do such a terrible script?Where is Billy Wilder when you need him?Michael B. Druxman

Woody Allen's ANYTHING ELSE (2003) is sort of an updated re-working of the director's Oscar-winning ANNIE HALL, in which Jason Biggs plays the Allen role and Christina Ricci takes over for Diane Keaton. Allen plays a colorful, albeit supporting, part as Biggs' lunatic mentor who has a hilarious "dark side".There are plenty of classic Woody Allen-style laughs in this neurotic comedy about a young, insecure comedy writer and his free-spirited, impossible to please girl friend. The cast, which includes Stockard Channing (as Ricci's unstable mother), Danny DeVito (as Biggs' manager) and Jimmy Fallon (as Christina's former boy friend), is certainly talented.The problem is that Woody Allen is the kind of writer whose dialogue has a certain unique rhythm. [David Mamet is another.] If the actors don't pick up that rhythm, the scene, no matter how well written, doesn't work. And, unfortunately, in the case of ANYTHING ELSE, the performers have not always captured the Allen rhythm. Several scenes that should have been funny, thus come off as an annoying whine.This film may not be anywhere near Woody's best work, but it certainly has enough engaging moments in it to make it worth a look.Michael B.

I think that writer-director Peter Gould and his fellow filmmakers intended that this 1998 movie should be a comedy, sort of a down South version of MEET THE PARENTS. Unfortunately, though the potential is there for a hilarious romp, neither the script, the direction, nor the actors are very funny.I'm not saying that the actors aren't good (They are.) or that the film doesn't have other merits (It does.). It's just that the people involved don't appear to have that special gift for doing comedy, thus we're given a straight light drama with several missed opportunities for laughter.Josh Charles plays a struggling Los Angeles Jewish novelist who travels to Georgia to meet the family of his girl friend (Alexandra Wentworth). These include her ailing, cantankerous, bigoted father (Lloyd Bridges in his final film role) and her brothers, Walter Olkewicz and Beau Bridges.What was supposed to be a two-day visit with Alexandra's family turns into a two-week nightmare, with Charles finding himself having to virtually baby-sit Bridges for the entire time.Though he looks shockingly ill, Bridges still manages to steal every scene in which he appears.Kristy Swanson co-stars. The ending of this film might surprise you.Michael B. Druxman

Everybody has a family member like Ned.Ned (Paul Rudd) is not really an idiot. He's just a nice, sweet, upbeat guy, perhaps too nave and trusting about people and the ways of the world. His best friend is his dog, "Willie Nelson," who his former girl friend (Kathryn Hahn) has taken from him.Unfortunately, Ned's sisters do not share his idealism. Forced to take him in when he becomes homeless, they find that his honesty and positive attitude clashes with their personal lives. Liz (Emily Mortimer), for example, is distraught that her marriage is failing and things don't get much better when Ned innocently reveals that her husband (Steve Coogan) is having an affair. Aspiring journalist Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) gets pissed at her brother when he refuses to help her get that "big story," and bi-sexual Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is not too happy when he reveals to her partner (Rashida Jones) that she is pregnant. Yet, despite the immediate mayhem that Ned's openness causes these three women, the ultimate result is a positive change in all of their lives.OUR IDIOT BROTHER is a soft, charming comedy, filled with real characters that we can easily identify with and care about. Director Jesse Peretz' film may not have any raunchy laugh-out-loud moments, but there are certainly a lot chuckles and most viewers will finish the movie with a smile on their face.Shirley Knight co-stars as the family's mother.Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment are a "Making of" featurette, audio commentary by the director and deleted scenes, including an alternate ending.Michael B.

TOKYO JOE (1949) may not be one of Humphrey Bogart's classic films, but it is certainly an entertaining thriller that features Bogie playing the kind of hard-boiled character that pleased his audiences.Set in post-war Japan, the Stuart Heisler-directed picture has Bogart cast as an ex-serviceman, returning to Tokyo, his home before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He is surprised to learn that his wife (Florence Marly), who he thought was dead, has divorced him and is now married to attorney Alexander Knox. He also learns that he has a child.To stay in Japan, Bogart forms an alliance with ex-Secret Service head Sessue Hayakawa. They start an air-freight business together, which Bogie soon learns is just a front to smuggle Japanese war criminals back into the country. Events come to a head when Hayakawa kidnaps Bogart's child to insure his silence.If you like Bogart, this one is worth a look.Michael B. Druxman

KISS ME DEADLY (1955), director Robert Aldrich's coarse, violent (for its day) take on Mickey Spillane's best-selling Mike Hammer mystery novel, is now available in a sharp restored hi-def edition by The Criterion Collection.Ralph Meeker is cast as the less than honorable private eye, who one night picks up a frightened Cloris Leachman on the highway. It isn't more than a few minutes before they're hijacked. She's killed, and he's put into his car and pushed off a cliff.Naturally, Meeker survives, but now he's out to find Cloris' killers, and also learn the secret of the big "whatsit," a crafty plot device that has inspired filmmakers, including Quentin Tarantino in PULP FICTION, for nearly fifty years.The supporting cast includes Albert Dekker, Paul Stewart, Jack Elam, Juano Hernandez, Wesley Addy and Marion Carr, and much of the film was shot on/around Los Angeles' seedy, albeit picturesque, Bunker Hill area, which, sadly, has been totally renovated in recent years.In addition to a brief alternate ending for the movie, this DVD release contains some excellent extras, including a compelling featurette on Mickey Spillaine, as well as one on the movie's screenwriter, A. I. Bezzerides, who did not like the original novel he'd been hired to adapt. There are also featurettes on the history of Bunker Hill, a on-camera critique of the film by director Alex Cox and audio commentary by film noir specialists Alain Silver and James Ursini. Finally, there is a 22-page booklet containing essays about the projectMichael B. Druxman

SHALLOW GRAVE (1994) is a marvelous little thriller in the Hitchcock tradition. Just when you think you know where the plot is headed, it takes a surprising turn in a different direction, then another and still another until you stop anticipating and just enjoy the ride.Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor (in his first film) star as a trio of carefree, self-involved roommates who take in a new boarder. Within days, they discover that this fellow has overdosed on drugs. They are about to call the police when they also discover that the deceased man has left behind a large suitcase filled with money.What to do?After pondering the situation for a couple of days while the corpse ripens in his bedroom, the trio decides to keep the money; cut up and bury the body. What they don't know is that the dead guy has some nasty friends who are looking for the dough.Danny Boyle directed the tight screenplay by John Hodge.The Criterion Collection has delivered SHALLOW GRAVE in a new restored digital transfer. Extras include audio commentaries by Boyle, Hodge and producer Andrew Macdonald. There are also recent on-camera interviews with Fox, Eccleston and McGregor, two "Behind the Scenes" documentaries and a booklet with an essay by Philip Kemp.Michael B. Druxman

PLEASE GIVE is a fine character comedy about some interconnected New Yorkers who are dealing with their individual and collective angst. In many ways, they are reminiscent of characters from a Woody Allen movie, but they speak in a different rhythm; the rhythm of writer-director Nicole Holofcener.Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt play a successful married couple, owners of a vintage furniture store who obtain their inventory at bargain prices from the estates of the newly deceased. Their daughter (Sarah Steele) is a typical teenager, burdened with overly bad skin problems.Wanting to enlarge their apartment, Keener and Platt have purchased the unit next to them, but they can't begin remodeling until the current resident, 91-year old and mean-spirited Ann Guilbert, dies or is taken to a nursing home. Her granddaughters, equally outspoken Amanda Peet and overly shy Rebecca Hall, care for Guilbert.Keener's feelings of guilt over her business practices, Platt's attraction to the unstable Peet and Hall's deep longing to emerge from her emotional cocoon propel these troubled, quite believable characters to alter their lives...at least, for the moment.Ms. Holofcener has assembled a likable, talented cast and given them an endearing screenplay with which to work.Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include outtakes, a "Behind the Scenes" featurette and a Q&A; with Holofcener.Michael B.

ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN may be the comedians' most popular movie, but that's not the primary reason to purchase Universal's new fabulous gift set, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO: THE COMPLETE UNIVERSAL PICTURES COLLECTION.All true Abbott and Costello fans, most likely, already have the studio's four previously released A&C; collections in their DVD libraries. So, why buy this one?First, this 15-disc set includes all 28 movies that the comics made for Universal, including IT AIN'T HAY (1943) which, for unknown legal reasons, was not included in any of THE BEST OF ABBOTT AND COSTELLO sets.Adapted from a story by Damon Runyon, IT AIN'T HAY is a fun movie, and contains such A&C; routines as "Mudder/Fodder" and "Betting Parlor".Second, unlike the earlier multi-problem, double-sided/double-layer discs in the BEST OF sets, these discs are single-sided with only 2 movies (rather than 4) per disc. No problems here.Finally, this set is handsomely packaged with a large box that not only contains the DVDs (including one devoted to Special Features) in seven separate cases, but also a 44-page book that has fascinating background information and trivia about the comedians and each of their movies.From ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS (1940) and BUCK PRIVATES (1941) through THE NAUGHTY NINETIES (1945), which contains the "Who's on First" routine, to ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE MUMMY (1955), is there a better gift for the Abbott & Costello fan?Michael B.

This three-disc set features a trio of restored silent films directed by Josef Von Sternberg. Titles include UNDERWORLD (1927), THE LAST COMMAND (1928) and THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK (1928). The box set also includes a 96-page booklet, filled with photographs and essays dealing with the director's work.Josef Von Sternberg is probably best remembered as the director who discovered and "created" Marlene Dietrich. He directed her in THE BLUE ANGEL, MOROCCO and several other films.Von Sternberg, however, was much more than Dietrich's collaborator. He was one of the cinema's most influential directors. His unique visual style and unconventional use of lighting and shadows anticipates the film noir work of Anthony Mann, Edward Dmytryk and other top directors of the genre, as well as Orson Welles.Sadly, with the exception of the Dietrich movies, most of Von Sternberg's sound pictures are virtually forgotten. His gift as a director was in creating an all-encompassing atmosphere through his visuals, not in his abilities as a storyteller. Indeed, much of his work in the 1930s and 1940s is dramatically inept.The three silent films in this collection are, arguably, the director's finest work, yet two of them suffer from an actor who does not seem to understand the word "subtlety".George Bancroft, best known to today's audiences for his performance as "Curley," the sheriff, in John Ford's STAGECOACH (1939), stars in both UNDERWORLD and THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK.In UNDERWORLD, one of Hollywood's first ventures into the gangster film, Bancroft plays the boisterous head of a gang of crooks who befriends a down-on-his-luck lawyer (Clive Brook) with an alcohol problem. Unfortunately, Bancroft's lady (the lovely Evelyn Brent) and the lawyer fall for each other, which motivates Bancroft, facing execution for killing a rival mob boss, to break out of prison and seek revenge.UNDERWORLD is a fairly involving, fast-paced story that, despite a few awkward moments, still works today. The key problem is that Bancroft's acting style is so over-the-top, compared to the other actors, that it's like they're performing in two different pictures.His performance is even more obnoxious in THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK, in which Von Sternberg does a magnificent job of recreating the New York waterfront, circa 1900.This movie is supposed to be a gentle love story about a ship's stoker (Bancroft) and his relationship with an attractive waif (Betty Compson), who he rescues after she attempts to drown herself.Compson is absolutely charming, one of the most talented actresses of the silent cinema. But, Bancroft is such a brute, the kind of guy who would rather punch you in the nose than say "Hello," that one has to wonder why Betty would ever agree to marry him, even if he did save her life.The best overall movie in this set is THE LAST COMMAND, which won star Emil Jannings the first Best Actor Academy Award. This engrossing story, told primarily in flashback, has Jannings cast as a former Russian general, cousin to the Czar, who was forced to flee his native country at the start of the 1917 revolution, and now (in 1928) works as a movie extra in Hollywood.Evelyn Brent co-stars as a revolutionist with whom Jannings falls in love and William Powell plays a former revolutionary leader, imprisoned by Jannings in 1917, who becomes a top Hollywood director and hires Emil in order to get some measure of revenge.Jannings may have been the greatest character actor of his day, but he, according to Von Sternberg (supposedly a major egomaniac himself), was impossible to deal with. When his Hollywood career ended with the coming of sound, Jannings returned to his home country of Germany where he became a minion of Hitler. According to legend, at the end of World War II when Allied troops were patrolling the streets of Berlin, Jannings was seen holding his Oscar statuette and begging the soldiers not to shoot him.Michael B.

Because of various legal issues, director Luis Bunuel's critically-acclaimed filming of Daniel Defoe's ROBINSON CRUSOE (1954) was virtually unseen (i.e. legitimately) in any medium for many decades.All that changed when VCI Entertainment released an exquisite, fully restored special edition of this classic film onto DVD.Dan O'Herlihy plays the shipwrecked Englishman who spends twenty-eight years on a desolate tropical island, sometimes on the verge of madness. O'Herlihy received a well deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination for his fine performance which had him acting solo for the first two-thirds of the picture.[That's right. Tom Hanks was not the screen's first castaway.]Though O'Herlihy's filmography boasts major roles in such revered films as ODD MAN OUT, Orson Welles' MACBETH, FAIL SAFE and MacARTHUR, younger audiences probably know him best for his performances in THE LAST STARFIGHTER, ROBOCOP and HALLOWEEN 3.Sad!Jaime Fernandez plays Crusoe's faithful native servant, Friday.Robinson Crusoe may have been a modestly budgeted movie, filmed in Manzanillo, Mexico, but it is still a rousing adventure story of one man's struggle for survival. Over half a century later, it holds up very well.VCI has included a number of interesting extras on the DVD , such as an audio interview with O'Herlihy and a reproduction of the original pressbook.

YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER is Woody Allen light.I know it's supposed to be a comedy. At least, the tone of the film starts out in that direction, but aside from a few mild chuckles along the way, the movie isn't really very funny.The actors are all excellent. Allen's direction is fine and several of the multiple character story lines certainly have laugh-out-loud potential. But, sadly, the guffaws never come.As is often the case in Woody's movies, the characters in this picture are seeking happiness on the other side of the fence, but when they get there, they find that the grass is not as green as they thought.Filmed in London, the movie features Anthony Hopkins as a successful businessman who leaves his wife (Gemma Jones) of forty years and, eventually, winds up marrying a hooker (Lucy Punch). Jones, in the meantime, falls under the influence of a phony fortune-teller (Pauline Collins), who convinces her that she has lived before, probably in Elizabethan times.Both of these situations contain tremendous comic possibilities, yet for some reason, Woody didn't pursue them, or if he did, the humor doesn't come off.Hopkins and Jones have a daughter (Naomi Watts), married to struggling writer Josh Brolin. Their relationship is also in trouble, with Brolin fawning over the beautiful woman (Freida Pinto) in the apartment across the way and Naomi falling in love with her married, philandering boss (Antonio Banderas).Not wanting to be a Spoiler, I won't be specific, but I wonder if this film might have worked better if some of the more interesting events that occur in the "third act" had taken place earlier in the movie. That would have definitely raised "the stakes," and allowed us (i.e. the audience) to become more involved with the characters.Despite these flaws, I remain a Woody Allen fan and look forward to seeing his next film.Michel B.

Although their stories are nothing alike, BULLHEAD has something in common with Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. It is difficult to talk in any detail about the plots of either film without becoming a Spoiler.Nominated this past year for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (from Belgium), BULLHEAD centers around a brutish cattle farmer (Matthias Schoenaerts), reliant on steroids and hormones, whose dark past comes back to slam him in the face when he begins negotiating a crooked deal with a notorious Mafia boss. The murder of a cop, and the farmer's sudden need for revenge against those who wronged him long ago, catapult events to a shocking finish.Directed by Michael R. Roskam, BULLHEAD is a compelling drama with several surprising twists and a couple of disturbing scenes. Schoenaerts delivers a haunting performance as the tortured hero whose life was destroyed in childhood, and the rest of the cast is also excellent.The picture is in Dutch and French with English subtitles.The DVD from Image Entertainment is filled with extras, including a "Making of" featurette, interviews with director Roskam and Schoenaerts and an early short film by Roskam, The set also includes a special collector's booklet with an introduction by director Michael Mann.Michael B.

Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) are a young couple whose marriage is in trouble. In an attempt to salvage the relationship, they spend a night away from their daughter in a motel, but things do not go as well as they had hoped.Simultaneous with this bleak look at their present lives, we visit the beginnings of Dean and Cindy's romance, a time filled with music, dance and all the other silly stuff that people do when they are falling in love.And, then we try to answer the question, what happened to make that all change?When it comes to showing the disintegration of a marriage, I don't think it was done any better than the breakfast montage in Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE. That sequence was about two minutes in length and it really said everything you needed to know about why the relationship failed.In BLUE VALENTINE, director Derek Cianfrance and his co-writers attempt to dig deeper into the reason(s) that love dies and people who have committed their lives to each other part.He has come up with an excellent, albeit depressing, script that often rings true, and he has elicited superb performances from his actors. Ms. Williams, in fact, received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her role.On the other hand, despite the emotional grittiness of the piece, the ultimate answer that Cianfrance presents us with is nothing that we haven't heard before: "People change. They grow apart."As we learn about halfway through the picture, as much as they were in love at the time, Dean and Cindy probably married for the wrong reasons. Yet, when they finally part, one can't help but think that this union, with some counseling, could have been saved.Based on his background (i.e. his parents divorced), I can certainly understand why Cianfrance would want to write/direct this film and, because they are great roles, I can understand why fine actors like Gosling and Williams would want to play them.What I can't understand is, as well-made as the picture is, why somebody seeking to be "entertained" would want to see it.Michael B.

When I was a kid, I spent my Saturday afternoons at the now long departed Roycroft Theater in Seattle, watching a shoot-'em-up movie, cartoons and, most importantly, the latest exciting chapter of a cliff-hanger serial.I outgrew those 13-chapter, low-budget actioners years ago, but some of them have remained etched in my memory. One of the most vivid is LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE (1946), which is, in fact, the first serial I ever saw.I must have been five or six years old when I saw that one, so when VCI Entertainment released it onto DVD, nostalgia made me want to revisit those innocent moments of my youth.Set following World War II, the story (such as it is) centers around super villain Lionel Atwill, who wants to get his hands on a rare substance that is located in a lost city, somewhere in the jungles of the Himalayas. This substance will neutralize the atomic bomb and allow Atwill to rule the world. Secret agents Russell Hayden and Keye Luke, working for the United Peace Foundation, are assigned to stop him.As in all good serials, our heroes are threatened (at the end of each chapter) with landslides, earthquakes and other terrible threats that they miraculously survive at the beginning of the following chapter.Even though the dialogue and the acting in LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE leave much to be desired, these 13-chapters are still fun to watch.What's really interesting is to see how the writers were able to write around Atwill's lead villain character, because the actor died midway through the filming.Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins directed LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE, which co-stars Jane Adams.Michael B. Druxman

With the possible exception of LAURA (1944), I don't think that Otto Preminger ever directed a more riveting motion picture than ANATOMY OF A MURDER, which is also one of the best courtroom dramas ever made.The film, adapted from the best-selling novel by Robert Traver, was quite controversial when it was first released in 1959, primarily because the trial not only involved a first degree murder case, but also a brutal rape. Though somewhat fictionalized, the case was based on a real incident, and Preminger chose to film his movie on the actual Michigan locations where the events took place.James Stewart starred as the defense attorney for Army lieutenant Ben Gazzara, on trial for shooting down the man who ostensibly raped his voluptuous wife (Lee Remick). Also in the cast were Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden, George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton, Kathryn Grant and legendary attorney Joseph N. Welch, who plays the judge. Duke Ellington composed the influential jazz score.Granted, the film does move along at a slightly deliberate pace, but unlike flashier courtroom movies, this one has the ring of truth about it.ANATOMY OF A MURDER was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture. Unfortunately, 1959 was also the year of BEN-HUR.The 2-disc DVD from The Criterion Collection not only features a new digital restoration of the film and an alternate 5.1 soundtrack, but there are also interviews with Preminger biographer Foster Hirsch, music critic Gary Giddens on the Ellington score; excerpts from a 1957 Preminger interview with William F. Buckley Jr., a booklet that includes essays on both Preminger and Welch and much more.Michael B. Druxman

Written and directed by Christopher B. Landon, BURNING PALMS (2011) is a mixed bag.It's an anthology movie consisting of five unrelated stories, each one taking place in a different part of Los Angeles.The production values and performances in the rather perverse quintet are all first-rate, and each of the individual stories is intriguing. Some of them, however, work much better than others.I particularly liked the comic tale about a gay couple (Peter Macdissi, Anson Mount) that decides to "adopt" an African child, as well as the story about the father (Dylan McDermott) who has a "close" relationship with his teenage daughter (Emily Meade) that makes his fianc&eacute;e (Rosamund Pike) very uncomfortable.The other stories are okay, but they lack focus and their resolutions are somewhat disappointing.Among the rest of the well-chosen cast are Paz Vega, Lake Bell, Nick Stahl, Zoe Saldana, Jon Polito and Jamie Chung.Michael B.

Meryl Streep certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her remarkable performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY, as did make-up artists Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland for their work on the production. Indeed, when she is playing the elderly Thatcher, if you didn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen, you wouldn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen.Sadly, Streep's performance is really the only reason the see this 2011release, because the movie itself is rather dull.The problem lies in its approach to the material. The story is told in flashbacks, which can often work, but in this instance director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have chosen to spend far more screen time with the aged, delusional Thatcher , having conversations with her late husband (Jim Broadbent), rather than focusing on her political career, which would have been far more interesting.Broadbent and all of the other actors, particularly Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd, playing the younger versions of Streep and Broadbent, are exceptional, but a film that prefers to concentrate on the framing story undercuts them all.I would have liked to have learned a lot more about Margaret Thatcher than I did from this picture.THE IRON LADY has been released in a 3-disc Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment. Extras include many "Making of" featurettes that are enhanced with interviews with the actors and filmmakers.Michael B. Druxman

This four-disc set from Kino Lorber should really be called THE SOPHIA LOREN/MARCELLO MASTROIANNI/VITTORIO DE SICA Award Collection, because the three films in the package feature the work of all three talents.You might say that Loren and Mastroianni were to the Italian cinema what Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn were to American films, and director De Sica was their George Cukor. When these artists worked together, "movie magic" happened.YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW (1963) won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. This bright comedy is, in fact, a trilogy, in which Loren and Mastroianni play three different roles.In the first story, they're a poor couple, who make their living by selling black market cigarettes on the streets of Naples. Sophia is also due to go to prison on a minor fraud charge, but under Italian law, that can't happen if she's pregnant or nursing, so she and Marcello decide to keep her in that condition...indefinitely.The second, and funniest, story almost entirely takes place on the road in a Rolls Royce. Sophia is the bored, ditzy wife of a wealthy man, who decides to have a fling with a middle class guy (Mastroianni) that she met at a party the previous night. He, however, is a bit wary of her.The final tale has Sophia playing a high-class prostitute who, not only has to deal with her rich best customer (Mastroianni), but also the young aspiring priest who lives across the way.MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE (1964) earned an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and also one for Loren as Best Actress.Mastroianni plays a successful businessman and Loren is his longtime mistress and confidant. All goes well...until he decides to marry a younger woman, and then ....Well, you've all heard the saying: "Hell has no fury like a woman scorned," haven't you?MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE is a rich, hilarious comedy.Unlike the other two movies in this collection, SUNFLOWER (1970) is an epic drama that is reminiscent of Loren and De Sica's earlier collaboration, TWO WOMEN (1960), which won her the Oscar.Set during and after World War II, the film cast Sophia as an Italian wife, searching for her husband (Mastroianni), reported missing on the Russian battlefields. Her search takes years, but she finally tracks down her spouse...only to discover that he is no longer the man she married.A bonus disc in this set contains VITTORIO D, a feature-length documentary about De Sica. This film includes interview with Clint Eastwood, Woody Allen, Mike Leigh and others.All of the films in the collection, available in both DVD and Blu-Ray, are in Italian with English subtitles.Michael B.

Written by producer Art Linson (THE UNTOUCHABLES) and directed by Barry Levinson (WAG THE DOG), WHAT JUST HAPPENED is a dark comedy that takes a realistic look at the tenuous life of a Hollywood film producer.Somebody once said that a producer will "sell his soul" in order to get his movie made, and this clever film seems be bear that premise out.Robert DeNiro plays a "powerful" producer whose "power" is hanging by a slender thread. Not only did his latest film have a disastrous test screening, but Bruce Willis (playing himself), the star of his next film, is refusing to shave his bushy beard for the movie, which might result in the entire project being cancelled.Though he's dealing with three children from two ex-wives, one of which (Robin Wright Penn) he still loves, DeNiro's job is to juggle his personal and professional lives and keep everybody happy. Studio head Catherine Keener insists that the recently previewed movie be re-cut, so the studio will only lose $15 million on it, instead of $25 million. Now, DeNiro must coax his unstable director (Michael Wincott) into making the changes before the movie has its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.He also has to deal with Bruce Willis' timid agent (John Turturro) and get the representative to force his client into shaving the beard. Willis, incidentally, seems to be having a ball spoofing himself, particularly in a scene in which he destroys the costuming department while throwing a temper tantrum.In his personal life, DeNiro discovers that Wright is sleeping with married writer Stanley Tucci, and that his teenage daughter had been having an affair with a much older agent who has just committed suicide.I really enjoyed this smart, often laugh-out-loud, comedy, but the fact is that this film will probably appeal more to industry "insiders," rather than the general public. You really have to know the picture business in order to truly enjoy this movie's humor.Sean Penn (as himself) and Kristen Stewart co-star.Michael B. Druxman

During the 1940s-50s, MGM may have led the way when it came to movie musicals, but Columbia certainly turned out a few classic tuners also, such as COVER GIRL, YOU WERE NEVER LOVELIER, PAL JOEY and this delightful 1955 release, adapted from the popular stage play by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov.Richard Quine directed the comedy about two Ohio girls who come to New York. Eileen (Janet Leigh), the beauty who is always attracting men, wants to become an actress, while Ruth (Betty Garrett), the more practical one, hopes to make it as a writer.The girls move into a Greenwich Village basement apartment that has no curtains, no hot water and sits over a spot where they are blasting for the New York subway. Then, they go out to seek their fortunes.Jack Lemmon, Bob Fosse, who choreographed the film, Tommy Rall and the Brazilian Navy play the men in the sisters' lives, while Dick York, Lucy Marlow and Kurt Kasznar are among their neighbors.The Jule Styne-Leo Robin songs are charming, as is the cast, particularly Ms. Garrett, one of the most under-appreciated musical performers of her day. Her numbers are a high point in the picture, as is an energetic dance number performed by Mr. Fosse and Mr. Rall.Michael B. Druxman

John Mills plays a submarine commander in ABOVE US THE WAVES (1955), the fascinating, essentially true story of a clandestine British mission to destroy a superior German battleship that is wreaking havoc on Allied supply convoys. The bold plan is to approach the battleship in still unproven four-man submarines and, rather than torpedo the vessel, plant explosives underneath their target's hull.Ralph Thomas directed the suspenseful drama, which co-stars John Gregson, Donald Sinden, James Robertson Justice and, in smaller roles, Theodore Bikel and Anthony Newley.Michael B.

Basil Dearden was a fine journeyman British director who made some very good films over the course of his long career, though none are really deemed to be "classics". A possible exception is that he directed one of the stories in the revered 1945 chiller, DEAD OF NIGHT, and he was also responsible for KHARTOUM, the 1966 epic that starred Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier.As part of their Eclipse Series, The Criterion Collection has now released a 4-disc set, entitled BASIL DEARDEN'S LONDON UNDERGROUND, which contains a quartet of Dearden films released 1959-1962. All of the pictures are well directed, superbly acted and feature engrossing stories, primarily dealing with such controversial subjects as racism and homophobia.About the only negative comment I can say about this collection is that, because all of the films are about fifty-years-old, the ways that these contentious subjects are handled are quite dated and, in most cases, are no longer valid. Laws and public views have changed radically since these movies were made, thus they must be viewed as products of their time.SAPPHIRE (1959) is the only color film in the collection. It stars Nigel Patrick as a Scotland Yard detective, investigating the murder of a young pregnant woman who, as it turns out, was a mulatto passing for white.Such a revelation was quite "shocking" to movie audiences of that day.Essentially a police procedural mystery, the film follows the efforts of Patrick and his bigoted partner (Michael Craig) as they try to find the killer. Is the culprit one of the girl's former black boy friends, or could it be a member of her baby's father's white family, who has just learned that the victim was of a mixed race.At the time that VICTIM (1961) was made, being a homosexual was a criminal offense in the United Kingdom, thus people of the gay persuasion were perfect fodder for blackmailers.Dirk Bogarde stars as a highly respected London barrister who has tried to put his youthful sexual preferences behind him and is now happily married to Sylvia Syms. However, he decides to risk all when a young man that he knew commits suicide in order to protect Bogarde from the people who were extorting money from him.This is a very good mystery, with a couple of clever red-herrings, which will keep you guessing right up until the identity of the main culprit is revealed.Released the same year as the Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack film, THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN (1960) is sort of an OCEAN'S ELEVEN, UK-style.Jack Hawkins recruits a group of former British Army officers, each with a dubious background, to pull off a major bank robbery. Among his cohorts in this light-hearted caper movie are Nigel Patrick, Richard Attenborough, Roger Livesey and the screenwriter (later a respected director), Bryan Forbes. [Also look for Oliver Reed in a brief, unbilled role.]Though dated like the other movies in the collection, this clever romp was ground-breaking in its time and is a welcome reminder that the heist movie can be more than a bunch of violent sequences enhanced by CGI special effects.Perhaps the most interesting picture in the set is ALL NIGHT LONG (1962), a powerful modern-day retelling of Shakespeare's OTHELLO, set against the background of the London jazz scene.The story takes place over the course of one eventful evening, the anniversary of married musical artists Paul Harris (the "Othello" role) and Marti Stevens ("Desdemona"). For his own jealous, ambitious reasons, Harris' drummer, Patrick McGoohan ("Iago"), tries to tear the interracial couple apart, leading to an almost tragic conclusion.The excellent cast also includes Richard Attenborough, Betsy Blair and Keith Michell, as well as the talents of such jazz greats as Dave Brubeck, Tubby Hayes, Charles Mingus and Johnny Dankworth, all playing themselves.Michael B.

Once it gets going, AND SOON THE DARKNESS is a pretty good little thriller that will have you sitting on the edge-of-your-seat during the last half hour or so.The film is a remake of a 1970 movie of the same name that starred Pamela Franklin. That picture dealt with two English girls on a bike trip through rural France. In this new version, the girls are American and they are traveling via bicycle in rural Argentina.Actually, I think that that, as well as some of the girls' other actions, is a pretty stupid thing to do, but in the movies, characters tend to do stupid things.In any event, the girls have a spat, briefly part company and then one of them (Odette Yustman) disappears. Her friend (Amber Heard) desperately tries to find her, but the town's one police officer is no help and she's not sure if she can trust the lone American (Karl Urban) there, who claims that his girl friend disappeared in this same area three months earlier.I've never seen the original version of AND SOON THE DARKNESS, so I can't really comment as to which might be better. This one, from director Marcos Efron, might be a bit violent for some people, but others will find it quite entertaining.And, the Argentina countryside is gorgeous.Michael B. Druxman

TO PARIS WITH LOVE (1954) is a cute, often amusing, romantic comedy that stars Alec Guinness as a widowed Scottish aristocrat who takes his sheltered, twenty-year-old son to Paris, in order to introduce him to the opposite sex. The son, on the other hand is determined to find a new female companion for his father.In a typical mix-up that can only happen in the movies, father finds himself matched with the younger woman meant for his off-spring, while Junior gets the more mature lady meant for Dad.Truthfully, this Guinness film is not on a par with some of his better-known outings (e.g. THE LAVENDER HILL MOB, THE LADYKILLERS), but it does have several funny sequences, many nice Technicolor views of Paris and the French countryside, and, at the end of the day, it's a pleasant way to spend 80-minutes.Robert Hamer directed the film that co-stars Odile Versois, Vernon Gray and Elina Labourdette.Michael B.

NEW YORK CONFIDENTIAL (1955) was one of the two missing "Holy Grail's" of Film Noir. [The other, still missing, is BLACK TUESDAY (1954) with Edward G. Robinson.]Historically, the movie is a "bridge" between the gang-oriented mobster classics of the 1930s-40s (e.g. LITTLE CAESAR, PUBLIC ENEMY, HIGH SIERRA, WHITE HEAT) and THE GODFATHER. It is one of the earliest films to deal with "organized crime" on a national level, a topic that had been front-page news in the 1950s during Senator Kefauver's Congressional Crime Hearings.Though "suggested" by a 1950s sensational expose' book by Jack Lait and Lee Mortimer, the screenplay by Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse appears to be a work of total fiction.There is a lot to like in this movie, but it does have its problems.On the plus side, it boasts a stellar cast of players, not the least of whom is Broderick Crawford, at his snappy-talking, "bull-in-a-china-shop" best. And yet, there are scenes in which he is allowed to exhibit a softer, more humorous side.Richard Conte is also fine as Crawford's steely-eyed "hatchet man," the kind of role he had played many times, and Anne Bancroft is terrific as Crawford's self-destructive daughter who is ashamed that her father is a mobster.Other effective players are Marilyn Maxwell, J. Carrol Naish and Mike Masurki.The picture has several good action sequences involving contract killings, particularly the one in which Mazurki murders a Washington lobbyist that borrows a page from the Alfred Hitchcock suspense handbook.I saw NEW YORK CONFIDENTIAL first run in 1955 (I was 14), and I recall being quite taken with this film that "exposed" organized crime.Viewing it today, however, I still find it to be fairly entertaining, but it doesn't really hold up as well as some of its gangster predecessors (e.g. WHITE HEAT, HIGH SIERRA). That's because it IS an "expose'," and what was shocking back in 1955 is kind of old hat in 2010. This is, indeed, a film of its time.The screenplay by Greene and Rouse is a bit "talky," primarily because the writers were trying to make the now well-worn point that much of the country, right up to and including the U.S. Congress, is controlled (or, at least, influenced) by organized crime.The characters and their family problems are certainly interesting and dramatic, but they lack any real texture, such as you find in THE GODFATHER or even its less successful predecessor, THE BROTHERHOOD (1968), which starred Kirk Douglas.Rouse directed the picture in a leisurely style, reminiscent of the television version of THE UNTOUCHABLES. Frankly, I think that somebody like Raoul Walsh or Phil Karlson would have infused the movie with a more needed energy.Despite those minor reservations, I am thankful that VCI Entertainment has made this long missing film available and, as an aficionado of the gangster movie, I am delighted to have it in my collection.Michael B.

Gary Cooper stars in MAN OF THE WEST (1958), which features a "hostage" storyline cut from the same cloth as RAWHIDE (1951) and DAY OF THE OUTLAW (1959). The film was directed by Anthony Mann.This was one of Cooper's final films and, frankly, he seems a bit old for the role, even though the movie itself is an excellent adult western with some good action scenes.Former outlaw Cooper, now a family man and rancher, is riding on a train that is robbed by his old gang. He, along with fellow passengers Julie London and Arthur O'Connell, are taken hostage, their lives threatened by half-crazed gang leader Lee J. Cobb, who wants Cooper to return to his old ways.Jack Lord plays a gang member.Michael B. Druxman

MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW is one of the most heart-breaking movies that you will ever see.It is also one of the finest films to come out of Hollywood's Golden Era.Director Leo McCarey's distressing story, though set during The Great Depression, could just as easily (and does) take place today. Elderly parents, no longer able to care for themselves, can and do become burdens to their offspring who are living their own lives. The way that the younger generation in this picture deals with the situation may be disturbing, but it is not atypical of what happens in real life.At its core, MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW is a love story between two people who have shared the vicissitudes of life together. Now, economic conditions and the whims of their children have required them to part.Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi are magnificent as the parents who are forced upon their children, and Thomas Mitchell and Fay Painter are equally fine as the couple who take in Bondi.There are many unforgettable, touching scenes in this 1937 release, such as the phone call that Bondi gets from her husband, which she must take while her daughter-in-law's "sophisticated" Bridge Club can't help but listen.Also poignant is the scene in which Bondi anticipates Mitchell's announcement that she can no longer stay with his family. Before he can speak, she makes his task easier by suggesting that she should go to an old age home.Mitchell is certainly the most sympathetic of the adult children, and his wife (Bainter) is not a villain either. McCarey makes us understand their frustration and pain about the impossible situation in which they find themselves.The other siblings, however, are selfish, cruel and rather inhuman.Or, maybe they are "human," and that's the tragedy.I dare you not to weep during the final moments of this masterpiece.

CORMAN'S WORLD is one of the most entertaining documentaries that I've seen in many years about a Hollywood personality. It's fast moving, informative and very funny.Directed by Alex Stapleton, the film features interviews with many notable alumni of the "Roger Corman School of Filmmaking," including (in no particular order) Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Jack Nicholson, David Carradine, John Sayles, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda, William Shatner, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Jonathan Demme, Peter Fonda and many more.Corman is perhaps the most prolific and influential filmmaker in the history of the medium. His career spans over six decades and includes such "legendary" exploitation movies as ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS, ROCK ALL NIGHT, and THE UNDEAD, as well as more memorable offerings like THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, THE RAVEN, THE WILD ANGELS and THE TRIP.True, none of his pictures ever won Oscars or will ever wind up on the American Film Institute's "Greatest Movies" list, but Corman's contribution to the film industry goes well beyond artistic recognition. He created a new guerrilla method of movie-making; a way of working with a "bare bones" budget, while creating a finished film that looks like it cost ten times what it actually did...and also makes a profit. Additionally, he also gave young, emerging talent, like those mentioned above, opportunities to hone their craft before they went on to bigger and better things.And, Corman does not believe in Hollywood's "gray list". I was in my fifties when I first started to write (and direct) for Roger Corman, and I will be forever grateful to him for making my lifelong dream of "making movies" come true.Michael B. Druxman

As the story of Cole Porter, DE-LOVELY is perhaps the best, most imaginative movie musical biography ever made. Unlike NIGHT AND DAY, the 1946 whitewashed Porter biography that starred Cary Grant and Alexis Smith, this film presents the composer with all his warts exposed.In other words, the Irwin Winkler-directed movie deals frankly with Porter's bi-sexual lifestyle, which often was quite indiscreet.Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd are deeply moving as Porter and his patient, loving wife, Linda. Both deliver Oscar-caliber performances.From Paris to Venice to Broadway to Hollywood, the Porters lived a glamorous and wildly unconventional existence that the composer boasted about in such chic songs as "Let's Misbehave" and "Anything Goes".The film begins with Porter as a bitter old man, visited by a mysterious figure (Jonathan Pryce) who we soon surmise is the Angel of Death. Suddenly, the two men are in an empty ragtag theater where Porter's life is presented to him as a musical revue that features his friends, both living and dead. The songs lead us into flashbacks of Porter's life, with the emphasis on his great love for Linda, who died many years earlier.Many of the songs in the film are performed by some of today's most popular recording artists, including Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Natalie Cole, Robbie Williams, Diana Krall and Alanis Morissette. However, the two most memorable numbers are "Be a Clown," sung by Kline in a scene set on the MGM Studio lot, and the very emotional "Blow, Gabriel, Blow, sung by Pryce and the entire cast.The DVD from MGM/UA Home Entertainment has many extras: audio commentaries with Winkler, Kline and writer Jay Cocks, several "Making of" featurettes, including one that deals with the staging of the "Be a Clown" number, deleted scenes and an alternate ending.Michael B.

This remake of the 1972 filming of Anthony Shaffer's 2-person stage play is as good as the original, just different. Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine were the stars of the original picture, and in this version Caine assumes the Olivier role and Jude Law takes on the part Caine played in 1972.Screenwriter Harold Pinter follows the general plot outline of Shaffer's play, but the smart, witty dialogue is all his and he also does a major re-working of the third act that, once again, may be different from the original, but I'm not sure if it's any better.The play is set in best-selling author Caine's isolated English manor house where hairdresser/aspiring actor Law comes to discuss Michael's wife, the woman both are bedding. What begins as a genteel conversation quickly escalates into a potentially deadly game of cat-and-mouse where one cannot tell what is real and what isn't.Kenneth Branagh, whose visual stylings are reminiscent of Orson Welles, directed the drama in such a manner that one is mesmerized, even though you are familiar with the play and know it's gimmick.Caine and Law are both at the top of their game.Michael B.

I have a special affection for MIRANDA.When I was a college freshman at the University of Washington Drama Department, we presented a production of Peter Blackmore's stage play at the Penthouse Theatre, and I did the role of the chauffeur, played in the movie by David Tomlinson.Miranda, played by Glynis Johns, is a mermaid, caught on a fishing trip by a successful London doctor (Griffith Jones), who immediately falls for her seductive charms. Concealing the fact that she has a fish tail instead of legs, the doctor brings Miranda home, telling his wife (Googie Withers) and others that the girl is an invalid who needs his personal attention.For the next several weeks, Miranda, who eats only raw fish, not only devours all the goldfish in the doctor's home, but she also captures the hearts of every male that enters the flat, all of which makes the doctor's wife very suspicious.Directed by Ken Annakin fro a screenplay by playwright Blackmore and Denis Waldock, MIRANDA remains an amusing comedy fantasy. However, I do think this material works better in its one-set stage origins, primarily because filmmaker's efforts to "open up" the play has muted its natural flow and made the story somewhat choppy and episodic.Michael B.

When it comes to playing comedy, few actresses are as adept as Diane Keaton, but the problem with this film is that her character is so annoying during the first part of the picture that, once she begins to soften and show her human side in the second half, it's still hard to warm up to her.Diane plays the meddling, long-widowed mother of three daughters, two of whom are married. Worried that her youngest (Mandy Moore) might wind up a spinster, she places an ad on a singles site and begins interviewing prospective husbands for the girl. When she meets the one she thinks is "Mr. Right," (Tom Everett Scott), she arranges for him to meet the totally unaware Mandy.Mandy, however, has met her own "Mr. Right," (Gabriel Macht), who Diane feels is totally unsuitable as a prospective son-in-law. Now, Mandy's dilemma is that she likes both guys, so which one should she choose?Michael Lehmann directed this amusing romantic comedy, which co-stars Stephen Collins as Macht's father and the man who eventually sets Diane straight.Michael B.

It's very seldom that I say that a particular movie would have benefited from a longer running time, but in the case of KILL THE IRISHMAN, I think that an additional thirty minutes would have turned what is now an entertaining gangster movie into a classic of the genre.Written (with Jeremy Walters) and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh, KILL THE IRISHMAN is based on the true story of Danny Greene, an Irish-American thug, revered by his neighbors as a local "Robin Hood," who in the 1970s, declared war on the Cleveland branch of the Italian Mafia. Greene survived many assassination attempts and his bold efforts, ultimately, led to the collapse of the Mob syndicate throughout the United States.Ray Stevenson is quite effective as the "take no prisoners" Danny Greene, and he is supported by an excellent cast that includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Paul Sorvino, Robert Davi and several other actors who are familiar faces in Mob movies.The problem is that there are so many characters and so much plot, all fascinating, that are crammed into the movie's 106 minute running time that the film feels like an outline for a more extensive epic drama. Great gangster movies (e.g. THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS) require texture and depth of characterization, while Hensleigh's picture presents the people who populate it with very broad strokes.Yes, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that HBO or Showtime might have done this story more justice.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a compelling documentary about the real Danny Greene.Michael B.

Written, directed and starring Josh Radnor, HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE is a pleasant romantic comedy enhanced by a likable cast, clever dialogue and some nice songs by Jaymay.Radnor plays an aspiring novelist who meets a young boy, separated from his family on the subway. When the boy refuses to let Rador take him to the police or social services, the writer, foolishly, lets the kid stay with him, a decision that could result in kidnapping charges.Yet, despite this intriguing storyline, HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE is, essentially, a movie about a bunch of neurotic New York folk who have relationship problems, either committing to or even recognizing the right person when he or she comes along.Radnor, for example, meets the woman of his dreams (Kate Mara), an wannabe cabaret singer, but avoids meeting her needs, while his best friend (Malin Akerman), who keeps getting involved with "a**holes," tries to shun the nerdy perfect guy (Tony Hale) who is pursuing her. Still, another of Sam's friends (Zoe Kazan), because of her insecurities, tries to "deep six" her long term live-in relationship with her boy friend (Pablo Schreiber) when he announces he wants to move to Los Angeles and, also, marry her.Everything turns out just fine in HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE, a marvelous date movie.Michael B.

The people who financed THE ARTIST must have been crazy.After all, what audience in 2011 would embrace a black-and-white, essentially silent, movie with a predictable plot that borrowed elements from many classic American films (e.g. A STAR IS BORN, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and even CITIZEN KANE)?In this instance, insanity paid off. THE ARTIST is truly a joyful motion picture, filled with humor and emotions that evoke memories of timeless masterpieces like Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS.Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, the ingenious film walked away with virtually every major award in the 2011 season, climaxing its astounding success with five Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin) and Best Picture.Set in Hollywood during the late 1920s when the movies were on the verge of talking, the story tells of a romantic leading man (Dujardin) in the Douglas Fairbanks tradition, who is tossed aside with the introduction of sound by his studio, the public and his wife. Conversely, on the way up the ladder to stardom is a young actress (Berenice Bejo), sort of a Ruby Keeler type, who the actor had helped when she was still struggling. There is a definite connection between these two, and when Ms. Bejo becomes the biggest star in the movies, she secretly tries to help the now penniless, proud and alcoholic former superstar of the silents.One doesn't have to be a genius to anticipate virtually every plot turn in THE ARTIST, but that's okay because the charm of this story is the engaging way that the director has chosen to tell it. He has even filmed his picture in Los Angeles on locations where, eighty or so years ago, scenes like these might actually have taken place.My only complaint, definitely a minor one, is that the picture could have lost perhaps ten minutes in its second half. Dujardin's fall from grace and his scenes of self-pity do go on a bit too long.THE ARTIST boasts a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Cromwell, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Malcolm McDowell, Ed Lauter and, of course, "Uggie," the Jack Russell terrier that steals every scene that he's in.The Blu-ray disc from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is filled with extras, including a blooper reel, a Q&A; with filmmakers and cast, and several "making of" featurettes, one of which looks at the various filming locations today and as they were back in the time when this movie is set.Michael B.

At the start of World War II, Nazi agents pursue a Czech scientist and his daughter (Margaret Lockwood) in order to get his formula for superior military armaments. They are able to kidnap them back to Germany from their safe haven in England, but a British secret agent (Rex Harrison), masquerading as a high-ranking German officer, executes a daring plan to rescue the pair before the scientist's secrets are revealed.Carol Reed directed this companion film to THE LADY VANISHES, which has a screenplay by the writers of that Hitchcock classic, Sidney Gillant and Frank Launder. The script has a couple of surprising plot twists, one of which occurs fairly early in the movie.Rex Harrison, in his first major film role, and Margaret Lockwood are joined in the cast by Paul Henreid (billed as "Paul Von Hernried" here), Basil Radford and Naughton Wayne, the latter two repeating their delightful "very British" comic cricket aficionados from THE LADY VANISHES, Charters and Caldicott.The main difference between this and the 1938 movie is that Hitchcock's picture is more of a mystery that begs to be solved (i.e. what happened to the old lady?) while Reed's film is, essentially, a chase melodrama. Even though NIGHT TRAIN identifies its villains as Nazis, which LADY didn't, neither film is meant to be taken too seriously.Despite the fact that it employs carefully crafted models (as did THE LADY VANISHES), rather than CGI special effects, the movie remains an exciting, fast-paced espionage thriller that is the equal to today's over-produced movies of that genre.I just wish that, during the final shoot-out with the Nazis, director Reed (or perhaps the film's editor) had thought to show Harrison reloading his revolver. I have no idea how many shots he fired, but it was certainly a lot more than six.Aside from a very good written essay by Philip Kemp in booklet form, the only other extra in this release is 30-minute video conversation about the movie with film scholars Bruce Babington and Peter Evans.Michael B.

THE PACIFIC from HBO is the true story of three Marines, Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale), Eugene Sledge (Joe Mazzello) and John Basilone (Jon Seda) and their journeys through the bloody Pacific theater of World War II, from Guadalcanal to Cape Gloucester to Peleliu to Iwo Jima to Okinawa and, finally, for two of them, the journey home.Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and others who were responsible for BAND OF BROTHERS, THE PACIFIC is, without question, a companion piece to that earlier acclaimed HBO mini-series.Perhaps the major difference between the two ten-part series, aside from the fact that one takes place in the European theater of World War II and the other is set in the Pacific, is that BAND OF BROTHERS deals with a company of soldiers, whereas THE PACIFIC centers on only three Marines. We, as viewers, are therefore more able to narrow our focus and understand the harrowing emotional struggles that these Marines experience.Like with BAND OF BROTHERS, the many battle sequences in this show are extremely realistic, violent and horrifying, as are the post-battle scenes. They may have been the enemy, but seeing the bodies of hundreds of mutilated, dead Japanese on the beach the morning after a nights-long firefight is very appalling.We, of couse, mourn the dead in THE PACIFIC, but this film compels us to equally mourn the loss of humanity suffered by the survivors, such as Eugene Sledge, a sensitive young man from Alabama who, by war's end, has become a brutal killing machine.Interestingly, the two most emotionally involving one-hour episodes of the series are #3 ("Melbourne") and #10 ("Home"), neither of which feature battle sequences. In the first one, the Marines from Guadalcanal are sent to Australia for a rest and one of them, Robert Leckie, becomes involved in a romantic relationship that the lady ends because she fears he will be killed. In the final episode, the men return home after the war and try to adjust to civilian life. Both of these episodes are extremely touching.THE PACIFIC is a magnificent epic production, beautifully written and directed, and filled with haunting images and memorable performances by a cast of, for the most part, unknown players. It is also a production that people who shy away from extremely violent films should avoid.A sixth disc in the handsomely boxed set contains the following extras:PROFILES OF THE PACIFIC contains several 10 minute featurettes about the real characters portrayed in the mini-series, including interviews with many of them and their family members.MAKING THE PACIFIC is a 20+ minute "Behind the Scenes" documentary that includes interviews with Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and several of the key actors.ANATOMY OF THE PACIFIC WAR is a 10-minute featurette that includes newsreel footage and interviews with scholars, who give a historical perspective to the Pacific war.Michael B.

This updated remake of GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS is an entertaining, if overlong (in its roadshow version), musical adaptation of the 1939 classic film, which starred Robert Donat and Greer Garson.Peter O'Toole is excellent in the leading role. He's no singer, but his songs don't really require a Howard Keel to put them across. Most of the singing, rightly so, falls to Petula Clark, who is quite charming.The songs are pleasant, though not really that memorable.Understandably, WHV has released the complete roadshow version of the film (rather than the shorter theatrical version) onto DVD. Frankly, I much prefer the theatrical version, because the roadshow version goes on about 20 minutes too long, making what could have been a very touching ending rather anti-climatic.Michael B.

Back in the 1950s and early 1960s, Randolph Scott and director Budd Boetticher made a series of low budget westerns that are now considered classics of the genre. This 1956 release was the first of them.The screenplay by Burt Kennedy has Scott playing a former sheriff who is hunting down the seven Wells Fargo bandits who killed his wife during a robbery. Following their trail, he encounters a struggling, California-bound pioneering couple (Gail Russell, Walter Reed) who he helps, and also ruffians Lee Marvin and Donald Barry.Lee and Donald join the group, hoping to help Scott catch the outlaws, then they plan to keep the stolen money for themselves.Shot in Lone Pine, California, this gem contains some good action sequences, strong characters, terse dialogue and a surprise story twist.The Paramount release is part of the Batjac catalogue and, as such, it contains plenty of extras, including a beautifully restored print, a lengthy and quite fascinating documentary about Boetticher and the films he made with Scott, a featurette about Lone Pine and also one on Ms. Russell.Michael B.

Inspired by the sensational, unsolved Sir Harry Oakes murder case, this tantalizing film from director Nicholas Roeg stars Gene Hackman as one of the world's richest men. He found his fortune in gold in the wilds of Canada during the 1920s and now (during WW2) resides on a private island in the Bahamas.Passion has gone out of Hackman's life. His only interest these days is daughter Theresa Russell, but he's disappointed that she has married fortune hunter Rutger Hauer.Hackman is also under pressure from Miami mobsters Joe Pesci and Mickey Rourke to sell them his island, so that they can build a casino.Visually stunning, if somewhat confusing, Roeg's film is filled with fine performances and mystical elements that will compel viewers to return for a second and third look.Michael B.

I think it was Woody Allen who wrote, "Comedy is tragedy with distance".The basic premise of AMERICAN DREAMZ is hilarious: To boost his popularity, the President of the United States agrees to appear as a judge on a television show, not unlike AMERICAN IDOL. The President, delightfully played as a moron by Dennis Quaid, is not unlike George W., his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) is reminiscent of First Lady Laura and chief advisor Willem Dafoe is a Karl Rowe clone.The comedy, written and directed by Paul Weitz, also looks into the personal lives of the TV show's producer-host (Hugh Grant), a rather self-centered fellow, as well as two of the contestants, Mandy Moore from Ohio, who is sort of a female version of Grant, and Sam Golzari, a totally incompetent Arab terrorist with a yen for Broadway show tunes.All of the performances are first-rate and the picture offers many amusing moments. The problem with the movie is that it also tries to find humor with the war in Iraq, where many people are being killed every day, and, worse yet, it has a major subplot that involves a plan by Arab terrorists to kill the President.Unfortunately, this is a bit too close to the painful truth to evoke many laughs.Even today, more than a half century after the event, one does not find humor in the Holocaust. You can make fun of Hitler, but not the Holocaust.With this movie, you can poke fun at former President George Bush, but the threat of a terrorist plot to kill him is not funny.Do we laugh at 9/11?Michael B.

The Criterion Collection has released a superb 2-disc edition of Terrence Malick's 1998 film adaptation of James Jones' novel of World War II.I first saw the film in a theater when it was first released, then later again on an earlier DVD release.I know that a lot of people think that this is the greatest war movie ever made but, unfortunately, I'm not one of them.Yes, visually it is absolutely stunning and it has some powerful scenes and terrific performances (e.g. Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, John Savage).However, if any movie could afford to lose 30-45 minutes of its running time, this is it.As in all of Malick's movies, the nature shots are fantastic, yet its dramatic structure is almost non-existent. A story about an Army company and its many members might work very well in a novel, but a screenplay has a definite structure that a writer must adhere to if it is going to work.I know the movie is about the battle for Guadalcanal, just like GONE WITH THE WIND was about the Civil War.But, what's the movie version of THE THIN RED LINE really about?Who is its protagonist?So many characters appear, and then disappear (sometimes without explanation), throughout the film, which makes that a difficult question to answer."War is Hell and it destroys the tranquility of nature."I assume that that is one of the messages that Malick is trying to convey. But then, as illustrated by one of the film's opening shots, nature can be pretty brutal, too.I have nothing against a film having a philosophical bent, but not if it's going to sacrifice good storytelling.On the other hand, Criterion's new transfer for this film is magnificent, and they've also included their usual array of first-rate extras, including audio commentary by cinematographer John Toll and others, interviews with many of the cast members and production staff, deleted scenes, audition tapes, a very informative and touching interview with James Jones' daughter, WW II newsreels of Guadalcanal and much more. Additionally, there is a 38-page booklet, filled with essays about the picture.If you like this movie, then this is certainly the edition to own.Michael B. Druxman

Cut from the same cloth as 3:10 TO YUMA, this is an exciting western thriller with a tight script by James Poe and sharp direction from John Sturges.When his Indian wife is raped and murdered, U.S. Marshal Kirk Douglas vows to bring the killer to justice. Complicating his task is the fact that the wanted man (Earl Holliman) is the son of a powerful cattle baron (Anthony Quinn), who is an old friend of Kirk's. Quinn "owns" the town of Gun Hill and, even though Douglas has taken Holliman into custody and has holed up in the local hotel, there is apparently no way that he's going to get him to the train that will take them back to his own territory.Carolyn Jones and Brad Dexter co-star.Michael B.

TAKERS is a very entertaining "cops-and-robbers" movie, enhanced with several well-executed action sequences that depend on stunts, rather than CGI.Idris Elba, Paul Walker, Michael Ealy, Hayden Christenson and Chris Brown make up a gang of Los Angeles bank robbers who have been able to pull off some remarkable, big money heists without being caught. Their luck takes a downward turn when a former associate (Tip "T.I." Harris) approaches them with a fantastic deal involving enough cash that the gang will be able to retire. Now, aside from the cops (headed by Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez) close on their trail, the gang also has to deal with the Russian Mob and a major double-cross by one of their own.Directed by John Luessenhop, the film is cut from the same cloth as Michael Mann's HEAT (1995) in that it takes the audience into the personal lives of the criminals, humanizing them to the point where we almost wish that they will get away with their crimes.The screenplay by Peter Allen, Gabriel Casseus, Avery Duff and Luessenhop contains several surprising plot twists, but also more than one lapse in logic. For example, in an opening sequence, the gangs robs a Federal bank, which had me wondering throughout the movie, why the LAPD was taking the lead in the investigation, rather than the FBI, which never even makes an appearance in the picture.However, the exciting action scenes, including the spectacular heist on the streets of downtown Los Angeles and a later shootout at Hollywood's Roosevelt Hotel, certainly take you mind off the minor failings of this likable "popcorn" movie that is what it is.On the other hand, I sort of felt sorry for the hotel maid at the Roosevelt who was going to have to clean the rooms at the Roosevelt after the gang had finished with them.:-)The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains audio commentary by the producers and director, plus a music video.Michael B.

Truth, they say, is stranger than fiction, and that is certainly the case with CHANGELING.This amazing story is, indeed, one that would be difficult to believe if it were not factual.Oscar-nominated Angelina Jolie stars as Christine Collins, a single mother living in 1928 Los Angeles. One day, while at work at the telephone company, her son vanishes without a trace. A nationwide search proves fruitless until, five months later, her "son" is located in the Midwest and returned to Los Angeles.The problem is that the kid is not Collins' son, even though the police insist that he is. After all, it would be very embarrassing to this then very corrupt police department if they'd found the wrong boy, right?When Collins keeps insisting that they've returned the wrong boy to her, the cops arrest her and put her into a mental institution, planning to keep her there until she stops her "rant".In the meantime, another detective, working a totally unrelated case, makes a shocking discovery involving a brutal serial killer who may be responsible for the disappearance of Collins' son.Clint Eastwood has directed another powerful motion picture, enhancing his reputation as one of our finest directors. The recreation of time and place is uncanny, and Jolie delivers a superb performance.John Malkcovich, Jeffrey Donovan and Amy Ryan co-star.DVD extras include two featurettes in which Eastwood and Jolie discuss the making of this unusual film and the actual case upon which it was based.Michael B.

This is the true story of Dr. Jack Kevorkian (Al Pacino) who, in 1990, challenged the world as he took the end of life debate head-on with his "Mercy Machine" and performed his first assisted suicide. He would continue this discordant activity well over one hundred times and the law was unable to stop him...until he went too far and injected the lethal drugs himself, an act that he dared to show on national television.Al Pacino delivers what is certainly the finest performance of his career in this HBO feature, completely submerging himself in the role of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. All of his "Pacinoisms" are absent in his portrayal. His Emmy Award was well deserved.Directed by Barry Levinson from Adam Mazar's script, the compelling, insightful drama tries to explore the inner mind and personality of "Dr. Death," and it is as successful as any film can probably be in discovering the controversial figure's "inner demon".Interestingly (an wisely), the filmmakers decided to begin this often bleak drama almost as a "black comedy," its first half hour or so exploring the off-the-wall lives of Kevorkian, his sister (Brenda Vaccaro) and his friend (John Goodman), who owns a medical supply business. It's only after the doctor begins his work in earnest and we get to meet some of his patients that the story becomes more serious and heart wrenching. One of his later court appearances, however, is quite funny.In the end, viewers may be more sympathetic to Kevorkian's "right to die" message than they are to him, whose downfall was due, in part, to his seemingly massive ego.Susan Sarandon, as a Kevorkian supporter, Danny Huston, in the role of his flamboyant attorney, and the rest of the cast deliver persuasive performances.It appears that some of the videos incorporated into the film are of Kevorkian's actual patients.Michael B.

TRUE BLOOD tells of a nice young girl (the delightful Anna Paquin) with a special power, who falls in love with a benevolent vampire.The series is set in the near future when vampires are becoming a part of normal society because a synthetic blood has been developed which removes the bloodsuckers' need for human nourishment.It is a well-made, quite entertaining show that takes the basic premise of BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in a totally different, slightly more serious, direction. Because of this intriguing premise, it allows the producers to insert a somewhat subtle message of tolerance for all creatures...living or dead.Frankly, I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, but this one has such interesting, multi-faceted characters and truly quirky storylines that I'm hooked. Production values are first-rate.The most engrossing story arc this season deals with the religious cult that wants to destroy vampires. These episodes are loaded with suspenseful moments and cliffhanger endings that make you want to immediately watch the following episode. Unfortunately, this narrative thread is pretty much over by the start of Episode 9. [Hopefully, it will return next season.] That leaves the Enchantress story to fill out the remainder of the season.Aside from the fact that she's one of the most beautiful women on working television today, I really enjoy watching Michelle Forbes in just about anything. She's a fine, intelligent actress who, given the right role, could certainly become a major star.It is definitely no reflection on her talents that the final 3 episodes of this season seem stretched and repetitive. That's the fault of the writers who failed to add another interesting element or two to the story mix.Personally, I think that zombies are a bore and having them dominate the final three episodes of this season was a mistake.On the other hand, the season does end with another terrific cliffhanger, even better than the one that concluded Season One. So, even with its few missteps, this sophomore season is well worth adding to your collection.Michael B. Druxman

Nominated for three Academy Awards, BROKEN ARROW (1950) is one of the great, landmark westerns. It's the first significant film that treated Indians as human beings and not just blood-thirsty savages, and led the way to such later films as CHEYENNE AUTUMN, LITTLE BIG MAN and A MAN CALLED HORSE.Adapted by Michael Blankfort from Elliott Arnold's book, BLOOD BROTHER, and directed by Delmer Daves, the film tells the essentially true story of Tom Jeffords (James Stewart and his friendship with Apache chief Cochise (Jeff Chandler, in an Oscar-nominated role).The year is 1870, and former Union soldier Tom Jeffords, tired of the on-going war between Apaches and white settlers, learns about the Apache culture in order to attempt a peace treaty between the two sides.Not only is Jeffords, over time, able to convince Cochise that such a treaty would be good for his people, but he also falls in love and marries a Native American girl (Debra Paget) with tragic consequences.Basil Ruysdael, Will Geer, Arthur Hunnicutt and Jay Silverheels (as Geronimo) co-star in this handsome, action-filled western.Michael B.

CENTENNIAL (1978) is one of television's most memorable mini-series. Adapted from the best-selling novel by James A. Michener, who appears in an on-camera Introduction, the nearly 21-hour epic production tells the story of a small fictional town in Colorado, beginning before it was established in the 18th century with coming of the fur trappers and mountain men, up to modern times. It is a magnificent achievement, shot in and around the beautiful vistas of the Rocky Mountains.The entire mini-series is now available on DVD in a handsome 6-disc/12 episode boxed set from Universal Studios Home Entertainment. Also included is a retrospective featurette that includes the memories of the production's cast and crew members.The filming of CENTENNIAL was not without its problems. Not only did the production encounter unexpected hardships that caused its budget to soar, but also one of the actors died in a freak accident after only one day of shooting his role.CENTENNIAL utilizes the services of four directors and also an all-star cast that includes Robert Conrad, Richard Chamberlain, Barbara Carrera, Raymond Burr, Michael Ansara, Timothy Dalton, Sally Kellerman, Lynn Redgrave, David Janssen, Dennis Weaver, Andy Griffith, Brian Keith, Clint Walker, Henry Darrow, Mark Harmon, Sharon Gless and many others.As much as I admire CENTENNIAL and still enjoy watching it, I do have a couple of minor "bones to pick" with the way the project was handled. My hunch is that these issues are the result of television network interference, rather than an artistic decision by the actual filmmakers.I think that many of the roles in the mini-series were cast with actors who the network knew would garner high television ratings (e.g. Conrad, Chamberlain, Burr, etc.), rather than other "name" actors who might be better suited for that particular character.Also, whereas the initial 3-hour episode should have begun with the story of Arapaho Lame Beaver (Ansara), it actually begins with the fur trappers (Conrad & Chamberlain), with the Lame Beaver saga being told "in flashback" during hour three. Unfortunately, these flashbacks stop the forward movement of the story.Still, I can't recommend CENTENNIAL too highly.Michael B. Druxman

N. Richard Nash adapted his own work for this perfect screen version of his hit Broadway play, later a musical (110 IN THE SHADE).Directed by Joseph Anthony, the 1956 film tells the story of a ranching family in the drought-stricken American Southwest of the 1930s, and how their lives are changed one night when a travelling con-man comes knocking on their door, offering to bring them rain for one hundred dollars.Burt Lancaster, in what is certainly a warm-up for his Oscar-winning performance in ELMER GANTRY, is superb as the fast-talking con-man who wants nothing more from life than to produce "one little miracle," and Katharine Hepburn is absolutely brilliant as the "plain" spinster daughter of the ranching family who does not trust Lancaster, but is, ultimately, won over by his charms.Lloyd Bridges and Earl Holliman play Hepburn's brothers, Cameron Prud'homme is the patriarch of the family and Wendell Corey is cast as the town's deputy sheriff who is smitten with Hepburn, but too frightened to do anything about it.This is a truly charming romantic comedy that has lost none of its luster over the years.Michael B.

This is a dazzling piece of entertainment; a superb show business biography and one of the last grand movie musicals.The film's musical numbers, as staged by Michael Kidd, are fabulous.The three-hour motion picture, directed by Robert Wise, stars Julie Andrews as Gertrude Lawrence, a great star of the musical theater during the 1920s-early 1950s. Among the legendary shows in which Ms. Lawrence appeared were PRIVATE LIVES, LADY IN THE DARK, OH, KAY!, SUSAN AND GOD and, near the end of her life, she was the original Anna in THE KING AND I, co-starring Yul Brynner.STAR! is not your typical whitewashed musical bio. It has a hard edge. Ms. Lawrence is portrayed as a woman who, with the exception of best friend Noel Coward (nicely portrayed by Daniel Massey in a role that garnered him an Oscar nomination), had trouble maintaining close relationships, even with her own daughter. She had numerous men in her life, often drank to excess, underwent bankruptcy and, with a star's superego, was not always the nicest person to be around.A major box-office disappointment when it was first released, probably because movie audiences were not familiar with Gertrude Lawrence, STAR! underwent several alterations (i.e. major cuts, revised ad campaign and even a new title, THOSE WERE THE HAPPY TIMES) in 20th Century Fox's futile effort to turn the film's financial fortunes around. It was, ultimately, pulled from release and remained virtually unseen for many years.Now restored to it's original "roadshow" version, the DVD features audio commentary by Wise, a 25th Anniversary featurette, plus other extras.Michael B.

Loosely inspired by actual events, TEXAS KILLING FIELDS starts off rather slowly, but evolves into an engrossing crime drama with some excellent, shocking action sequences. Its major problem is that it presents viewers with more questions than it ultimately answers.Apparently, over many decades, there has been a series of unsolved murders on a large piece of swampland, located between Houston, Texas and the Gulf Coast. The killings remain unsolved, in part, because police departments in different jurisdictions, for whatever reasons, did not share information. [I gleaned this data from the Internet, because it is not made clear in the movie.]In this fictional screenplay, written by Donald F. Ferrarone and directed by Ami Canaan Mann (director Michael Mann's daughter), small town Texas cops Sam Worthington, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jessica Chastain are after a serial killer who is murdering young women and dumping their bodies in the swampland. Unlike with the real life homicides, they do solve their case, but there are a couple of intriguing, quite surprising "red herrings" along the way.The performances in TEXAS KILLING FIELDS are first-rate, even if some of the character's motivations are not apparent in the script. What the film really lacks is some backstory, particularly for the detective played by Morgan, as well as a scene in which everything is put into context.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains audio commentary by Mann and Ferrarone.Michael B.

John le Carre's books were the anti-James Bond spy novels of their day. Instead of a lot of sex, action and fancy gadgets like were found in the .007 adventures; le Carre's secret agents worked in a world more in touch with reality. They did their secretive work in a comparatively mundane, plodding manner.Some of le Carre's best-selling novels (e.g. THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD) worked well when they were transferred to film, but others did not.The 1979 television mini-series, TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY, in my minority opinion, falls into the latter category.Yes, most critics of the day thought that this six-part, one-hour series was the greatest thing since chopped liver and the program was honored with many awards. Certainly the cast, headed by Alec Guinness as retired spymaster George Smiley, was magnificent, but watching this series today one can easily see its flaws.The story, set during the Cold War, has to do with Smiley's clandestine efforts to trap a mole who has infiltrated the British Secret Intelligence Service at its highest level.Aside from the fact that the plot moves along at a virtual snail's-pace, my major complaint with this series is that there are far too many flashbacks.Flashbacks may work well in a novel, but in a film they often impede the forward movement of the story. I have not read le Carre's novel, but my hunch is that the person who wrote the script followed the novel far too closely.Novels are novels and films are films. They are two separate animals.Hopefully, the forthcoming theatrical movie version of TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY will be more film than novel.The fine cast of the series includes Ian Bannen, Ian Richardson, Hywell Bennett, Michael Jayston, Bernard Hepton, Joss Ackland, Alexander Knox and Patrick Stewart.The 3-disc DVD set from Acorn Media also includes a half-hour interview with le Carre.Michael B.

These days, if you want to film one of Shakespeare's plays and have your finished movie appeal to the masses...or, at least, to more than an art house audience... you can't make the picture appear to be "Shakespeare".Face it. Shakespeare movies are "not tonight" movies (i.e. "Yes, we should see that one, but not tonight.").Although it certainly didn't do box-office business to get excited about, actor/director Ralph Fiennes's recent modern day filming of CORIOLANUS, one of The Bard's lesser know works, is as much an exciting action movie as it is a rendition of the play, evoking memories of Ian McKellan's ground-breaking version of RICHARD III.Director Fiennes, who plays the leading role, makes Shakespeare's narrative easy for audiences to follow by using continuous television news reports that help relate the story of a feared and revered Roman General, suddenly pitted against his own city and fellow citizens. Rebelling against the political designs of his manipulative mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and banished by his own people, Coriolanus joins forces with his sworn enemy (Gerard Butler) to exact his revenge.CORIOLANUS is a powerful, well-made, engrossing drama that often makes you forget that you are watching a Shakespearean play. It is enhanced by performances from a fine cast that includes Jessica Chastain and Brian Cox, who steals every scene in which he appears.The combination Blu-Ray/DVF pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains audio commentary by Fiennes and a "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

As the author of BASIL RATHBONE: HIS LIFE AND HIS FILMS, it amazes me that I had never seen THE STINGIEST MAN IN TOWN before. But, the truth is that, when I was writing my book over thirty-five years ago, I had no idea where to find a viewing copy. Those were the days before home video.Even if I had been able to see it, I probably would not have given the production much more of a mention than I did. My book, after all, dealt with the "Films" of Basil Rathbone, not his television appearances.However, thanks to Video Artists International, a DVD of this 1956 musical version of Charles Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL is now available. It is a kinescope of a live black-and-white broadcast, so one should not expect the pristine quality found it most home video releases.Certainly the strongest aspect of this Daniel Petrie- directed production is its score that features music by Fred Spielman and lyrics by Janice Torre. There are several memorable tunes in the show, such as "An Old-Fashioned Christmas," "Golden Dreams," "It Might Have Been" and the title song.The problems with the production are more apparent today than, I think, they would have been back in 1956. Standards, after all, have changed.Cast members like Vic Damone, Johnny Desmond and Patrice Munsel may have been marvelous singers and had major fan followings, but the play might have been better served had their roles been cast with actors who could sing, rather than simply fine singers.Also, the cast, including Rathbone as Scrooge, seems to be giving stage performances, playing to the "upper balcony" rather than to the television camera.Nevertheless, THE STINGIEST MAN IN TOWN is a very entertaining way to spend 81 minutes of the Christmas season, and we are grateful to Video Artists International for preserving this classic program for future generations.Michael B.

The Criterion Collection has now released LUBITSCH MUSICALS, an absolutely delightful 4-disc boxed set that contains a quartet of director Ernst Lubitsch's very risque' musical-comedies that he made for Paramount between 1929-1932.Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald each star in three of the films. Interestingly, although the performers make an engaging couple on screen, the fact is that they did not like working together. When it came to doing THE MERRY WIDOW at MGM in 1934, Chevalier felt double-crossed by Lubitsch, because the director had promised him that MacDonald would not be in the picture, then reneged.The movies in this collection are definitely dated, but they are still a lot of fun to watch. Being a Chevalier fan, my only disappointment is the fact that none of his three films contain any of his "signature songs". What's even more baffling is that in THE LOVE PARADE (1929), MacDonald's character is named "Louise," which makes one wonder why "Louise," Chevalier's most famous song, was not included in that score.THE LOVE PARADE, Lubitsch's first talking picture, like THE SMILING LIEUTENANT (1931), has Chevalier cast as a ladies man who winds up marrying royalty. In the earlier film, it's MacDonald, the Queen of Sylvania, who wins his heart, while in the later picture, Princess Mariam Hopkins steals him away from cafe' entertainer Claudette Colbert.Also in the cast of THE LOVE PARADE is Lillian Roth, who was the real-life subject of the award-winning Susan Hayward movie, I'LL CRY TOMORROW (1955).MONTE CARLO (1930) could easily have been another Chevalier/MacDonald pairing, because the two leading roles are not dissimilar from those in THE LOVE PARADE. However, in this film, British theater veteran Jack Buchanan (THE BANDWAGON) takes on the Chavalier role, pretending to be a hairdresser in order to gain access to Countess Jeanette's bedroom.ONE HOUR WITH YOU (1932) is my personal favorite in this collection. In it, Chevalier and MacDonald play a happily married couple, and Genevieve Tobin plays Jeanette's best friend, who tries to steal Maurice away from her.Chevalier's song "What Would You Do?" is the film's musical highlight.There are no DVD extras in this set, but each movie is accompanied by some extensive and interesting liner notes.Michael B.

Spencer Tracy stars in BROKEN LANCE (1954), a powerful drama patterned after Shakespere's KING LEAR. In truth, this western, which won a Writing Oscar for Philip Yordan, is a remake of a modern day film, HOUSE OF STRANGERS (1949) that featured Edward G. Robinson in the Tracy role.Tracy, appearing only in flashback sequences, is a ruthless cattle baron with four sons. The three eldest, including Richard Widmark, he treats like hired hands, favoring his youngest boy (Robert Wagner), who agrees to serve a three year jail term instead of his father.While he is incarcerated, the other sons double-cross Tracy, which results in his death and causes Wagner to seek revenge upon his release.Jean Peters, Katy Jurado and Hugh O'Brien co-star in this excellent western.Michael B.

This is the granddaddy of books dealing with Hollywood's dark side.Drawing as much from gossip as he does from known facts, author Kenneth Anger dishes all the "inside dope" about the glamourous stars of Hollywood's Golden Age.From the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial to the Lana Turner/Johnny Stompanato affair, no scandal is left out of this book that continually pushes the envelope to the very edge and, possibly, over it.For example, there's one drawing in the book of Cary Grant (circa 1930s) that bears the caption, "Who's a fairy?"There are also some very unflattering photos of stars without clothes or make-up, being arrested and even dead.If you are looking for something "in good taste," this book is definitely not for you.On the other hand, if you're looking for an entertaining diversion, then HOLLYWOOD BABYLON might just be it. Just don't believe everything you read.Michael B. Druxman

WE DIVE AT DAWN (1943) is a submarine picture, directed by Anthony Asquith, and starring John Mills as the captain of the HMS submarine Sea Tiger. The movie does begin a bit slowly as we get to know the crew and their personal problems, yet once the sub is out to sea, the action moves along quite quickly.The Sea Tiger's assignment is to locate a new German battleship and sink it, but they soon find that they have missed their target and must now follow the battleship into the heavily fortified Baltic Sea in order to complete their mission.A tense depth-charge attack and a daring attempt to refuel the Sea Tiger in an enemy-controlled port are key sequences in this well made picture that co-stars Eric Portman.Michael B.

Filled with the color red, SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET was the perfect "Christmas movie"...even if the "red" was blood. Gushers and gushers of blood.I'm joking, of course.I think the fact that a picture whose "hero" is a serial killer and involves cannibalism was released into theaters on Christmas week 2007 is rather ludicrous. Certainly Halloween would have been more appropriate. But, that's a discussion for another day.Directed by Tim Burton in a dark style reminiscent of his equally excellent SLEEPY HOLLOW, SWEENEY TODD features a bleak, almost colorless production design in the film that is absolutely mesmerizing. Indeed, as previously stated, the only prominent color is red.The movie won the Academy Award for its Art Direction.Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter are superb in the two leading roles, and Stephen Sondhiem's music and lyrics are extremely clever, particularly "A Little Priest," Johanna" and "Pretty Women".The plot, set in London during the early 19th-century, finds barber Sweeney Todd (Depp) returning from prison and exile to seek revenge on the corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who framed him so that he could steal his wife. Todd is helped by Mrs. Lovett (Carter), who owns a bake shop and makes "the worst pies in London".While awaiting an opportunity give the judge a very "close shave," Todd and Mrs. Lovett devise a plan whereby he will slice the throats of his unsuspecting customers and she will turn their bodies into meat pies.Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen are fine in two of the movie's key villainous roles, as is Ed Sanders, the boy who plays "Toby". He is a terrific performer.Also in the cast are Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener and Laura Michelle Kelly.SWEENEY TODD is not for the faint of heart, but it is a brilliantly executed picture that deserves all the accolades that it received.The 2-disc "Special Edition" DVD from DreamWorks Home Entertainment has many "Making of" and "Behind the Scenes" featurettes that focus on the various aspects of the production, plus a documentary on the "Real History of Sweeney Todd" and the origins of the stage musical.Michael B.

During his years as an actor, former President Ronald Reagan made no secret of the fact that he enjoyed playing in Westerns. None of the oaters he made ever achieved the status of a SHANE or HIGH NOON, but on a strictly visceral level, all were entertaining.One of his better Westerns was TENNESSEE'S PARTNER (1955), directed by Allan Dwan, which has now been re-released onto DVD in a widescreen edition by VCI Entertainment. A good script, adapted from a story by Bret Harte, enhances it.Reagan plays a square-shooting cowboy who befriends shifty gambler John Payne, then gets romantically involved with the equally devious Coleen Gray. Rhonda Fleming co-stars as the owner of a gambling establishment and Anthony Caruso, of course, is the film's lead heavy.Michael B. Druxman

Adapted from a stage play by Alan Melville, SIMON AND LAURA (1955) is a delightful British comedy about the Fosters, a renowned British acting couple (think Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh), who are hired by the BBC to do a daily show about their "blissful" married life.The problem is that, in real life, this pair is constantly fighting, throwing vases and other crockery at each other, as they head for divorce court.They, nevertheless, for financial reasons, agree to do the show and, before long the program is a huge success. Now, if only the two can avoid "killing" each other.Peter Finch and Kay Kendall are marvelous as the bickering couple, and Ian Carmichael is also hilarious as their somewhat naive producer. The dialogue is witty and director Muriel Box keeps the action moving at a nice pace.Michael B. Druxman

Director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY), with a script by first-time writer Michael C. Martin, delivers another gritty, violent and riveting cop drama about three officers facing life-defining crises.There is really nothing new in the basic set-up of this picture. We've all seen these kinds of cops before: the veteran uniformed officer, counting the days until is retirement, the undercover cop and the narcotics officer who has crossed over to "the dark side".What makes BROOKLYN'S FINEST interesting is that these three overly familiar "types," who never really interact in the picture except in the most inadvertent manner, are constantly surprising us by their actions. We do not know how these individual stories will end until the final credits roll.Officer Dugan (Richard Gere), separated from his wife, drinks on the job, visits a prostitute at night and does his best to avoid dealing with the rampant crime around him. However, once he has actually retired, he puts his life at risk to redeem his career of indifference.Officer Butler (Don Cheadle) has been working undercover to bring down drug gangs (even in prison) so long that he has lost all remnants of his personal life. His wife has divorced him, and now his superiors want him to set-up former drug kingpin Caz (Wesley Snipes). Butler must now decide where his true loyalties lie, with the Department or with the man who had saved his life in prison.Officer Procida (Ethan Hawke), on the other hand, is doomed right from the movie's opening scene. Tragically, with a large loving family, he has more to live for than the other two cops, but there is no hope. His story has to end badly. We just don't know how it will happen.Director Fuqua's location filming brings s strong, frightening sense of reality to the proceedings.The actors, particularly Hawke, deliver remarkable, award-worthy performances, and a fine cast of players, including Will Patton, Lili Taylor and Ellen Barkin, supports them.My complaints on this film are minor. The running time could have been a bit shorter and, like with most movies these days that deal with drug gangs, it's often difficult to understand what these particular characters are saying.Michael B.

The works of George Bernard Shaw are like the works of William Shakespeare. They were written to be performed on the stage, not on film.If you want these great plays to work in the motion picture medium, then adjustments must be made.Shaw's comedies, in particular, though filled with colorful characters and brilliant wit, are also burdened with his social commentary and speechifying, which might work well in the theatre, but taxes the patience of a movie audience.Such a "burden" was lifted when Lerner & Lowe turned the playwright's PYGMALION into the hit musical, MY FAIR LADY. Songs took the place of the cumbersome speeches.Shaw was personally involved in both the casting and production of the first two films in this collection, MAJOR BARBARA (1941) and CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA (1945), and the result is pure Shaw. That is not, necessarily, a bad thing if you approach these pictures as a filmed version of a stage play.Yes, in both movies, director Gabriel Pascal does his best to "open up" the action, even to the extent of incorporating some brief battle sequences into the Technicolor CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, but at the end of the day, these are still two filmed stage plays with all of the playwright's long speeches seemingly uncut and too many key events taking place off-stage.Again, that is not to say that pure Shaw cannot be entertaining. It can be, particularly when the splendid casts of these pictures deliver his clever dialogue.MAJOR BARBARA stars Wendy Hiller, a favorite of the playwright, as the daughter of a wealthy munitions manufacturer (Robert Morley). She works as a Salvation Army officer and speaks out against the hypocrisy she believes exists in her organization. Rex Harrison, Robert Newton and newcomer Deborah Kerr co-star.Although Shaw was not happy with her performance, Vivien Leigh is absolutely charming as the kittenish Cleopatra in CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, which co-stars Claude Rains in a brilliantly subtle performance as the Roman leader.Stewart Granger and Flora Robson are also in the cast of what was, at that time, the most expensive British film ever produced.Pascal produced, but did not direct ANDROCLES AND THE LION, the first Shaw play to be filmed after the playwright's death. The directing assignment fell to Chester Erskine.Although it has other issues, this 1952 release is certainly the most audience pleasing of the Eclipse trio, probably because it's more movie than filmed stage play. The witty dialogue is still present, but Shaw's lengthy social commentary has been kept to a minimum.Do you think this movie caused the great man to turn in his grave?Also contributing to the picture's success is the extremely likable performance of funnyman Alan Young in the title role of the shy, animal loving, Christian slave who pulls a thorn from a lion's paw and, as a result of his kind act, is spared from death in the Roman Colosseum.Jean Simmons, Robert Newton, Maurice Evans, Elsa Lanchester and Reginald Gardiner contribute to the fun. Indeed, a confrontation scene between Gardiner and Newton with Young trying to intercede, is a comic highlight.Only Victor Mature, as the Roman centurion who falls in love with doomed Christian Ms. Simmons, seems a bit out of his league in his role. The actor is certainly adequate, but a James Mason or a Laurence Olivier might have delivered a more interesting reading of Shaw's words.Michael B. Druxman

Arguably inspired by actual events, THE WAY BACK is the story of a journey for survival. The movie was adapted from a memoir by Slawomir Rawicz, the authenticity of which has been challenged.In 1940, seven men escaped from their brutal gulag in Siberia to make the long, arduous 4500-mile trek across Russia, Mongolia and Tibet to freedom in India.Director Peter Weir's film, true or not, is an engrossing epic drama; a testament to human courage and endurance. It is filled with magnificent, albeit treacherous, panoramas of barren deserts and snow-covered mountains, and features fine performances from the likes of Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell, Mark Strong and Saoirse Ronan, cast as a teenage runaway who joins the group of desperate men.The film was shot in Morocco. Bulgaria and India and has been released onto DVD by Image Entertainment.Michael B. Druxman

Is Curtis LaForche having a futuristic vision, or is he in the early stages of schizophrenia?That's the question that we keep asking ourselves as we watch TAKE SHELTER, writer-director Jeff Nichols' tense psychological thriller that features an astounding performance by Michael Shannon as Curtis, as well as stellar dramatic turns by the rest of the fine cast.Construction worker Curtis LaForche (Shannon) lives in a small Ohio town with his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and their six-year-old, hearing impaired daughter (Tova Stewart). When Curtis begins having nightmares and hallucinations of a coming apocalyptic storm, he not only builds an expensive storm shelter in his back yard, much to the concern of his family, friends and employer, who eventually fires him, but he also begins to doubt his own sanity, since he mother had fallen victim to schizophrenia years before.Nichols endows his story with a deliberate pace that allows viewers to take the journey with Curtis as, on the one hand, he succumbs to his unnerving "visions" by building the expanded storm shelter while, on the other, exploring the looming possibility that he is, indeed, losing his sanity like his mother (Kathy Baker) did when she was his age.At times, the slow pacing works against the film, which would probably have been more effective than it is already, were it trimmed by twenty minutes.I don't care how "great" an individual scene or moment might be. If the information it conveys is redundant and it slows the overall tempo of the film, then it should go. That's why "God" created "Deleted Scenes" sections on DVDs.Nevertheless, TAKE SHELTER is a fine film with an ending that will definitely have viewers pondering long after the picture has ended.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains informative and interesting audio commentary by writer/director Jeff Nichols and star Michael Shannon.There are also two deleted scenes, a 10-minute "Behind the Scenes" featurette and a 20-minute Q&A; with Shannon and co-star Shea Whigham.Michael B.

It definitely held my interest, even though it did go off on a couple of unnecessary story tangents.But, in the end, I was very disappointed.The producers certainly knew that there was a good chance that their series would be canceled at the end of the first season, yet they chose to end it with a cliff-hanger.I think that the show's loyal fans deserved a satisfactory conclusion.Michael B.

Robert DeNiro plays a parole officer about to retire and Edward Norton is cast as a convicted arsonist, trying to convince him that he should get an early release from prison in this gripping "noirish" thriller from director John Curran.Rather than "convince," the wily Norton is, actually, trying to "manipulate" DeNiro into writing a favorable assessment. He even goes so far as having his beautiful, off-the-wall wife (Milla Jovovich) seduce the corrections official in order to accomplish that.Though Angus McLachlan's screenplay sometimes tends to meander, it is populated with a quartet of fascinating multi-dimensional characters, none of which are particularly likable, yet all who are seeking some sort of spiritual enlightenment.DeNiro, in a loveless marriage (to Frances Conroy), finds that his church going cannot help him avoid his darker impulses, while Norton, after he witnesses a fellow prisoner being murdered, claims to have had a religious epiphany. The operative word here is "claims," because we're never quite sure if he's telling the truth or if this apparent change is simply a ruse to get what he wants.What makes STONE so compelling is its performances. DeNiro, in one of the most complex roles he has had in years, plays a man fighting the evil within him, while Norton utilizes his unique talent to bring to life a chameleon-like sociopath. Though she does not have a lot to do, Ms. Conroy is brilliant as the mostly silent, religious wife who has bargained away her life out of fear.Certainly Ms. Jovovich, cast as the bold, sexy wife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, delivers the most colorful and surprising performance. Part bimbo and part seductress, this is one of those women of film noir who would give Barbara Stanwyck's "Phyllis Dietrichson" (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) a run for her money. And, it is also prime evidence that Ms. Jovovich is capable of doing material much more interesting than the RESIDENT EVIL franchise.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

LAST CHANCE HARVEY is a totally predictable, yet very charming romantic comedy that works because of the immense likability of its two stars, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.New Yorker Dustin and Londoner Emma are two strangers who lead lonely, unhappy lives. He's a frustrated composer, musician, making a good living writing jingles for commercials, while she conducts polls at the London airport, while dealing with a dotty mother (Eileen Atkins) who thinks that her new neighbor is a serial killer.When Dustin, his job hanging by a thread, flies to London to attend his somewhat estranged daughter's wedding, he and Emma meet by chance.There is instant chemistry between them and, over the course of a day, they have such an effect on each other that both their lives are completely turned around.As previously stated, there's nothing particularly unique about the story. This is just a "feel good" movie.Kathy Baker, James Brolin and Richard Schiff co-star in the picture, written and directed by Joel Hopkins.The 2-disc set includes audio commentary by the director and stars, a "Making of" featurette and more.Michael B.

Shot in New Orleans, SEEKING JUSTICE is an entertaining action-thriller that evokes memories of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and other classic films of that conspiracy genre.Nicolas Cage, in an unusually well moderated, low-key performance, plays a happily married high school teacher whose wife (January Jones) becomes the victim of a brutal rape. While waiting in the hospital, he is approached by a concerned stranger (Guy Pearce) who offers to get justice for his wife in exchange for a favor, sometime in the future. Distraught, Cage agrees to the vigilante course of action and, within hours, word comes that the rapist has "committed suicide".Six months later, Jones has recovered from her physical injuries, yet is still on edge from her horrific experience, when Cage is summoned by Pearce to return the "favor" by killing an alleged child pornographer. And, if he doesn't do it, there will be dire consequences.There are a few surprising plot twists in this fast-moving film, which is actually a lot better than I expected. True, there are moments where your believability quotient may be slightly strained, but with these kinds of movies, you either go along with them or you don't, and in the case of this Roger Donaldson-directed thriller, the tendency is to just enjoy the ride.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a "Behind the Scenes" featurette.Michael B.

Watching CURB YOUR ENTHUSUASM is like viewing a train wreck.You're shocked. You're appalled. But, you can't turn your head away. You just have to see what is going to happen next.As anybody who has been following this show knows, Larry David's television persona is that of a "world class shmuck". He always seems to be saying or doing the wrong thing, which gets both himself and others into some very uncomfortable, "painfully" funny, situations.The primary plotline for this season is, of course, the SEINFELD show reunion. Thus, all the key cast members of that iconic series (e.g. Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) appear as both themselves (or as how David has written them) and also their Seinfeld characters in multiple episodes of CURB.It's very enjoyable to revisit these popular television characters after ten years, yet the SEINFELD episodes are not the funniest, most outrageous segments of this season.I found myself laughing out loud at the controversial "Denise Handicapped" episode, which not only had Larry dating a lady in a wheelchair (actually two of them), but also getting into a wrestling match with Rosie O'Donnell.I also enjoyed "The Hot Towel," an episode that had Larry "stalking" his poor doctor (Philip Baker Hall).Then, of course, there is "The Bare Midriff" episode, which also caused a considerable controversy because it had Larry accidentally urinating on a picture of Jesus.If there is a weakness to this series, it's that some of the predicaments that Larry finds himself in seem forced, totally unbelievable. For example, in one sequence, a take-out restaurant owner has him arrested for "stealing" a few extra paper napkins. Seriously, would the police even take a report for such a "crime"?Thankfully, missteps like this are few and far between.David's real-life friends, Ted Danson and wife Mary Steenburgen, plus Richard Lewis continue to be semi-regulars on the series, and Shelley Berman and Richard Kind are back as David's father and cousin respectively. There are also guest appearances by Meg Ryan, Christian Slater, Elisabeth Shue and Catherine O'Hara.Michael B. Druxman

Though it has its issues, LONDON BOULEVARD is a pretty good gangster movie, which seems to draw some of its inspiration from films like CARLITO'S WAY and even SUNSET BOULEVARD.Fresh out of a British prison after spending three years on an assault charge, tough guy Colin Farrell is determined to go straight, even though his best buddy (Ben Chaplin) and his brutal, ultra-violent boss (Ray Winstone) are determined to bring him back into the rackets by fair means or foul.Farrell gets a job working for reclusive movie actress Keira Knightley, who is constantly being stalked by paparazzi stationed outside of her house. A romantic relationship develops between them, and they even make plans to escape London forever. Unfortunately, the spurned Winstone is not about to let that happen.William Monahan (THE DEPARTED) both wrote and makes his directing debut with LONDON BOULEVARD, which moves along at a fairly nice clip and never really loses our interest. The cast is uniformly excellent.The primary problem that I have with this picture is one that is shared with many of today's British movies, and that's its language.Years ago, when actors like Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave or Trevor Howard were making films, you could hear and understand every word they said on screen. Today, performers akin to the very talented and charismatic Colin Farrell often mumble their lines or speak in an accent and/or with slang that is difficult to understand. You may be able to generally comprehend what is happening on screen, but the subtleties escape you.There are also a couple of unexplained "holes" in the story, like: Who was the paparazzi in the olive green jacket and what was his purpose?On the other hand, perhaps that was explained in the dialogue that I didn't understand.Next time I watch this movie, I think I'll turn on the subtitles.Michael B.

The Criterion Collection has released DAVID LEAN DIRECTS NOEL COWARD, a four-disc boxed set containing the quartet of films that the two artists made together during the first half of 1940s. The collection is being released in both Blu-Ray and DVD editions. This reviewer's remarks are based on the DVD set.All four films, two of which are in Technicolor, have been magnificently remastered. The colors are brilliant and balanced; the black-and-white images sharp and solid.I'm not going to use much space talking about the individual movies, since anybody who decides to purchase this collection will, undoubtedly, be well familiar with them.IN WHICH WE SERVE (1942) was co-directed by Coward and Lean and deals with a ship of the Royal Navy, sunk in the Mediterranean during the early days of World War II. This event occurs at the start of the picture, thus most of the narrative is told via flashback as the survivors cling to a life raft, being strafed by German planes while they await rescue.Coward plays the ship's captain, and we follow his story, as well as the histories of several crew members. Among the cast in this stirring film, nominated for a Best Picture Oscar,are John Mills, Bernard Miles, Celia Johnson, Kay Walsh, Michael Wilding and Richard Attenborough.THIS HAPPY BREED (1944) is the story of an average middle class British family seen over a period of twenty years, from the end of The Great War to just before the beginning of World War II. It is a tale of the vicissitudes of life.The Technicolor film stars Robert Newton, Celia Johnson, John Mills, Kay Walsh and Stanley Holloway.BLITHE SPIRIT (1945), also in color, is a sparkling comedy about a man (Rex Harrison) who must explain to his present wife (Kay Hammond) why his late wife (Constance Cummings) has decided to haunt them. Margaret Rutherford plays the wacky medium who has brought the poor fellow's problems about. The players are all in top form. A delightful fantasy, adapted from Coward's popular stage play.BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is one of the finest romantic films ever produced, an absorbing love story, adapted from Coward's play, STILL LIFE.The plot is very simple. Married doctor Trevor Howard and suburban housewife Celia Johnson happen to meet on a train platform and enter into a quietly passionate, ultimately, doomed, love affair.This collection includes a fabulous cornucopia of extras. Among them are new interviews on all the films with Noel Coward scholar Barry Day, a 2010 interview with cinematographer/screenwriter/producer Ronald Neame, documentaries on the making of IN WHICH WE SERVE and BRIEF ENCOUNTER, a 1971 television documentary on David Lean, a 1969 audio conversation between Coward and Richard Attenborough, a 1992 British television show about the life and career of Coward and much more, including a 46 page booklet filled with essays about the various movies and the talented men who made them.Michael B.

KRITZER TIME is the third and final book in Bruce Kimmel's "Benjamin Kritzer Trilogy," a highly entertaining, thinly-disguised account of the author's life through his high school years.Whereas the first two books, BENJAMIN KRITZER and KRITZERLAND, emphasized the humorous aspects of the subject's often bizarre childhood, this last installment is more serious.On the positive side, Benjamin makes up his mind that he wants a life in show business, to become an American Anthony Newley. Yet, there is also a sense of loss, as his family moves away from the house in which he grew up, and, tragically, the brutal murder (still unsolved) of an aspiring young actress, his closest friend.KRITZER TIME is a book that will make you smile and also cry. It's the perfect conclusion to a fine trilogy.

Every year there seems to be an intelligent, quite worthy film that gets completely overlooked when the Oscars and other critical awards are given out. THE COMPANY MEN (2010) is such a film.Exquisitely written and directed by John Wells, THE COMPANY MEN is a sad chronicle of our times. It yearns for an earlier period, not that long ago, when Americans made "things" that they could point to and be proud of (e.g. cars, ships), rather than just "make money".The story deals with America's economic downturn and the devastating effect it has on three men, all highly successful and in upper management or executive positions, who are the victims of corporate downsizing. Once they finally comprehend the realities of their dire circumstances, each of these men deal with their individual situations in completely different, even tragic, ways.The cast of this film is superb, not a false note among them. They include Ben Affleck, Chris Cooper, Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Maria Bello, Rosemarie Dewitt and Craig. T. Nelson.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment has a number of extras, including audio commentary by Wells, a "Making of" featurette, several deleted scenes and an "Alternate Ending," which, frankly, I think works better than the one used in the final film.THE COMPANY MEN may deal with a painful subject, but it is an excellent movie.Michael B.

MADE IN DAGENHAM is sort of a British version of NORMA RAE.The film, based on a true story, is set in the late 1960s. It tells of a group of English women, employed at the Ford Motor Factory, who took on management and their own union by going out on strike, insisting on equal pay for equal work.The always charming Sally Hawkins, playing an ordinary working class wife and mother, becomes the unexpected leader of the revolt, encouraged by her sympathetic union representative (Bob Hoskins) and, surprisingly, the attractive wife (Rosamund Pike) of the plant's manager, a highly educated, intelligent woman who, as a female, feels the same lack of respect from the men in her life.Like the Sally Field classic, MADE IN DAGENHAM is one of those "stand up and cheer" movies that climaxes when the striking women meet with Miranda Richardson, the British Secretary of State. The film has a superb screenplay by William Ivory and was directed by Nigel Cole. Also in the well-chosen cast are Geraldine James, Jamie Winstone, Rupert Graves, Nicola Duffett and Richard Schiff, who plays the tough American Ford representative, sent to the UK to put those striking women in their place.My only complaint with this otherwise excellent entertainment is the fact that, because England and the United States do not share a common language, some of the dialogue is difficult to understand.Michael B.

THE KING'S SPEECH is everything that a great movie should be.It tells a good story and it tells it well.After the death of his father (Michael Gambon) and the scandalous abdication of his older brother (Guy Pearce), Bertie (Colin Firth), who has suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life, is suddenly crowned King George VI of England.With the country on the brink of war, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), and after a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course of treatment that will cure the monarch's stammer and help him find the voice to encourage his people.David Seidler's well-crafted screenplay and Tom Hooper's sensitive direction transports us back to a not-so-long-ago era of innocence when the world was about to be shattered, once again, by war.The film, which covers two decades, spends much of its time dealing with court intrigues, primarily involving the affair between Edward VIII (Pearce) and his affair with twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.However, the spine of this story is the relationship and growing friendship between two men, the future king (Firth) and a commoner (Rush), who helps the ruler overcome his disability and become the inspiration of his nation.The performances by the entire cast, including Timothy Spall (as Churchill), Derek Jacobi, Claire Bloom and Anthony Andrews are perfect. They transform names from out history books into real, multi-dimensional people.Some writers have commented that THE KING'S SPEECH is historically inaccurate, in that it glosses over Edward's possible Nazi sympathies.Seidler's script touches briefly on that issue, but one must remember that this is not a documentary, but a dramatic presentation of actual events. This film is not about Edward. He is merely a supporting player in a story that centers on his brother and Lionel Logue.Frankly, I think a future film that deals with Edward's sympathies toward Hitler and his cronies would make fascinating viewing.THE KING'S SPEECH marks one of the very rare times in recent years where my favorite movie of the year has won the Best Picture Oscar.Perhaps there's hope for the Academy yet.Michael B. Druxman

When you see a movie by Mike Leigh, you expect a film with a minimum of plot, a quiet, deliberate pace and characters who are quite ordinary human beings; people we know, or even us. Yet, despite the absence of gunfire, explosions or overly dramatic sequences, you find yourself mesmerized, completely drawn into the lives of these emotionally damaged characters.ANOTHER YEAR(2010), which earned Leigh an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, is no different.Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) have been married for over thirty years and have the quintessential happy marriage. He's an engineer and she's a counselor. Together they serve as a steady anchor to their unmarried circle of family and friends, including Mary (Lesley Manville), Gerri's alcoholic, overly needy co-worker, who desperately wants to find her "Prince Charming" (but never will). In fact, at one point, she fantasizes that Tom and Gerri's grown son, considerably her junior, might fulfill that dream for her. When he turns up with his beautiful young girl friend, Mary is devastated.Mary's storyline dominates this engrossing drama about the vicissitudes of family and friendship, following the lives of these characters over a one-year period.Ms. Manville is brilliant as a woman "drowning in quicksand," who cannot help herself and, by film's end, is simply tolerated by her friends. The final lonely image of her, sitting at a table full of happy people, is unforgettable.ANOTHER YEAR is available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Extras include audio commentary by Leigh and Manville, a "Making of" featurette and a short documentary about Mike Leigh.Michael B. Druxman

Adapted from a novel by Christopher Isherwood, A SINGLE MAN is an engrossing, bittersweet, often humorous, tale of loss, isolation and the discovery of what is important in life. The fact that it deals with a gay man, in the days before people came "out of the closet," has nothing to do with the film's basic message. This story would have been just as viable had the protagonist been a heterosexual.George Falconer (Firth), as he goes through what he has determined will be his final day, not only recalls the loving relationship he had with his late partner (Matthew Goode), but he also begins to notice little things about his world and the people who inhabit it. He, for example, compliments a secretary in the college's administration office on her pretty smile, and he takes some extra time to get to know his neighbor's bratty kids.Charley (Julianne Moore), his closest friend and long ago lover, is fighting her own sense of loss; her husband has left her and her son is grown and out of the house. She would, desperately, like to woo George back to her, but it is a hopeless cause.It is only Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), a young student trying to come to terms with his own true nature, who might dissuade George from his fatal course of action.The film has an ending that is quite unexpected.Firth, Oscar-nominated for this picture, delivers a magnificently low-key performance. He has no loud, emotionally charged scenes, yet he commands the screen with his eyes and subtle facial language.Ms. Moore is also very affecting in the role of George's hard-drinking friend, as are Goode and Hoult in their supporting assignments.A SINGLE MAN is a totally involving, positive look at the human condition and the importance of the seemingly mundane moments of life.Michael B.

After a two or three year absence, emotionally-remote Swedish homicide detective Kurt Wallander (Kenneth Branagh) returns for a third season of three compelling feature-length mysteries, all adapted from the novels by Henning Mankell.In AN EVENT IN AUTUMN, the detective finds the remains of a young woman buried behind his recently purchased house and soon discovers that her death is connected to the murder of another woman who was thrown off of a ferry.THE DOGS OF RIGA begins when the bodies of two mobsters from Latvia wash up on Swedish shores, and Wallander is asked to travel to Riga in an effort to catch the killers. What he finds, however, is a den of police corruption that he must expose in order to stay alive.A friend of Wallander's estranged daughter comes to him for help in BEFORE THE FROST, and then disappears. It's not long before it becomes apparent that she has become involved in a religious cult that employs arson as its primary weapon.The performances in this trio of films are superb, as are the striking vistas in Sweden and Latvia against which he stories take place.The 2-disc set is from BBC Video.Michael B.

There have been very few films that have really grabbed my emotions to the extent that the tears kept flowing after the movie had ended.FIELD OF DREAMS is one, as are PLACES IN THE HEART and John Huston's adaptation of James Joyce's THE DEAD. Now, director Stephen Daldry's film of Bernhard Schlink's best-selling novel, THE READER, joins that short list.Kate Winslet won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for her performance in that post-Holocaust drama, but as much as I enjoyed SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, I think that THE READER should have won Best Picture also.This is a story that presents the Holocaust's war criminals as "human beings," not the two-dimensional villainous figures that have populated other films about this horrible, tragic era. By showing these characters as real people, we can (hopefully) understand their behavior, as evil and unforgivable as it might be.I'm not in any way suggesting that Winslet's acts should not be punished. What she did was despicable. Yet, you cannot put her in the same category as, say Hilter or even the Ralph Fiennes character in SCHINDLER'S LIST. They were truly evil people who knew exactly what they were doing.It's no excuse, but Winslet's character committed her terrible acts out of, for lack of a better word, stupidity.Winslet plays Hannah, a woman who has a passionate summer affair with a much younger man, Michael (played at different ages by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes).After she suddenly disappears, Michael is confused, then she resurfaces years later as one of the defendants in a war crimes trial stemming from her actions as a concentration camp guard.Incidentally, the tears that I shed in this film were for Michael, not Hannah.The DVD from The Weinstein Company and Genius Products contains eleven deleted scenes, in-depth interviews/conversations with Daldry, Kross and Winslet, plus several other "Behind the Scenes" featurettes.Michael B.

This is a powerful, vivid and depressing story about a college student (Rosario Dawson) who is brutally date raped by a football jock (Chad Faust), then goes into a self-destructive state of depression, only to emerge from that void in order to extract an even more brutal revenge on her rapist.Ms. Dawson and Faust deliver convincing performances and co-writer (with Brian Priest) and director Talia Lugacy attempts to deliver an important message about how violence can destroy the human soul. However, Ms. Lugacy needs to learn an important basic lesson about storytelling: "Less Is More".There is not one sequence in the movie that would not have benefitted from being cut in half. Scenes that could have made their point in the first ten seconds seem to go on endlessly. Indeed, there was one point, about halfway through the picture, where I got so bored that I jumped to the next chapter stop, so that I could get on with the story. Later, after the picture was over, I went back to see if I'd missed anything important. I hadn't.In the future, I would suggest that director Lugacy not only light her scenes so that the audience can see what is happening on screen, but also work with an editor who can convince her that every shot in a film is not "sacred".Michael B.

THE TERMINAL is the most charming film that director Steven Spielberg has made in years.Inspired by an actual incident, the touching comedy stars Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a non-English-speaking citizen from a small, imaginary Eastern European country who arrives at New York's JFK airport only to learn that a revolution has taken place in his nation. Thus, because of bureaucratic glitches, he cannot legally enter the United States, nor can he return home.Navorski is forced to remain inside the airport terminal until his situation can be rectified.Inside the vast terminal, which, incidentally, is a fabulous set that, along with Hanks' brilliant nuanced performance, deserved to be (but wasn't) recognized come Oscar time, Viktor must learn to survive.He finds a place to sleep in an unfinished part of the building, makes friends among the airport workers and even finds employment as a construction worker.Viktor also finds romance in the person of Catherine Zeta-Jones, an airline stewardess who is involved in a dead-end affair with a married man.Stanley Tucci plays the head of airport security. He's not an evil man, but the fact that Hanks is stuck in his terminal for month-after-month might prevent him from getting the promotion that he's been seeking for years. Therefore, he must find a way to rid himself of this thorn-in-his-side, using fair means or foul, even if it means that Hanks will wind up in prison.Chi McBride and Diego Luna are also in the cast.Michael B.

WINTER IN WARTIME is an engrossing World War II drama, set in 1945 Holland.The story centers on 13-year-old Michiel (Martijn Lakemeier), son of his village's mayor. When local Resistance fighters are captured and killed by the Germans, Michiel finds himself helping a downed British flyer (Jamie Campbell Bower). The youth, working on his own, plans to get the flyer to another village, so that he can reach a contact that will get him back to England. But, when a dead German soldier is found (shot by the flyer), the situation changes.The Germans take hostages, and one of those hostages is Michiel's father.Based on the best-selling book by Jan Terlouw and superbly directed by Martin Koolhoven, the Dutch language (with English subtitles) film is filled with suspenseful moments and several surprising plot twists. This is a "coming of age" story under the worst possible circumstances, as a young boy finds that his entire world and everything he loves is put at risk, forcing him to make decisions that will change his life forever.I'm not a big fan of war movies, but this one is quite powerful. It stays with you long after the final credits roll.

SUBMARINE is not your typical coming-of-age movie.It is filled with great warmth and wit, and takes a serious look at teen concerns without lapsing into a raunchy style of comedy found in so many movies of this genre.Adapted by screenwriter-director Richard Ayoade from Joe Dunthorne's novel, the story tells of Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), a sensitive Welsh teenager who does not "fit in" with his fellow students. He spends his time daydreaming about how people would react to his death, listening to recordings by French crooners and also plotting how to lose his virginity, preferably with the equally eccentric Jordana (Yasmin Paige), who likes to start fires.Although he seems to hit a home run in his relationship with Jordana, Oliver does have some real world issues that he must confront. His parents (Noah Taylor, Sally Hawkins) are not getting on well and, in fact, Oliver suspects that Mom is having an affair with the next-door neighbor (Paddy Considine), her old flame. If that's not bad enough, Jordana's mother has a brain tumor and is facing surgery.How the young man deals with these problems is what growing up is all about.I was quite moved by this charming film. The performances are exquisite, most of all Sally Hawkins, who is always a delight to watch, and young Roberts. There may not be any laugh-out-loud moments, but it is quite funny. SUBMARINE is well worth seeing.DVD extras include a "making of" featurette and some deleted scenes.Michael B. Druxman

Released in 1954, this was a daring, original musical comedy; way ahead of its time.Not only did it spoof western movies, a genre that was then considered "sacred," but it also did so in a surrealistic manner, utilizing colorful stylized sets and costumes.The film, directed by George Marshall, concerns a gunslinger who rides into town to confront the man who killed his brother.Sure, it's been done before, but thanks to some catchy songs by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans and bright, tongue-in-cheek performances by a talented cast that includes the always marvelous Rosemary Clooney, Jack Carson, Guy Mitchell, Pat Crowley, Gene Barry and a dancing Buddy Ebsen, RED GARTERS remains an entertaining family film after more than fifty years.Michael B.

I first saw Terrence Rattigan's THE BROWNING VERSION (1951) about 40 years ago, and I have never been able to forget the remarkably subtle performance of Michael Redgrave as Andrew Crocker-Harris, the shy, embittered, middle-aged schoolmaster who is suffering from poor health, a disastrous marriage to a cruel, cheating wife (Jean Kent) and the realization that he has failed his students.One scene in particular, in which one of his students (Brian Smith) gives him a small present, has always stayed with me. So taken aback by this act of kindness, Crocker-Harris breaks down into tears, perhaps the first time he has done so in his adult life.Anthony Asquith directed this sensitive filming of the Rattigan play, which won the the Best Actor and Best Screenplay awards at the Cannes Film Festival.Nigel Patrick and Ronald Howard co-star.The DVD from The Criterion Collection contains some interesting extras, including a vintage interview with Redgrave and an interview with Mike Figgis, who directed the 1994 remake of THE BROWNING VERSION.Michael B.

In THE WRESTLER, Randy "The Ram" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a former superstar wrestler whose age and twenty years of injuries have finally caught up with him.Rourke delivers the performance of his career in this very human drama, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. The movie might best be described as "ROCKY with a realistic ending".Marisa Tomei is also marvelous as a stripper who is getting too old for that game and is trying to resist Randy's romantic advances.BE WARNED: It may all be fake, but the wrestling sequences in this picture are so brutal that you may find yourself turning away from the screen while they are in progress. (I did.) And, the crowds for those scenes are nothing short of sadistic.Bruce Springsteen wrote and sings the title song over the end credits. It's a great number that didn't even get nominated for an Oscar. Frankly, I think it was the best song of 2008. It really brought the theme of the movie home.Michael B. Druxman

Charles Dickens' classic tale, A CHRISTMAS CAROL, has been performed innumerable times on stage, screen, radio and television. Gifted actors like Lionel Barrymore, Alastair Sim, Reginald Owen, Fredric March, George C. Scott and even Bill Murray have all played miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who after a night of ghostly visits, becomes a new person who embraces life and is kind to his fellow man.My favorite rendition of Dickens' story is SCROOGE (1970), a musical in the tradition of OLIVER! (1968).Albert Finney is marvelous in the title role, playing to perfection both the elderly Scrooge and also the money lender as a young man, who chooses his quest for wealth over the one love of his life.Alec Guinness co-stars as Marley's Ghost, Edith Evans is the Ghost of Christmas Past and Kenneth More plays the Ghost of Christmas Present. Also in the talented cast are Laurence Naismith, Michael Medwin, David Collings, Anton Rodgers and Suzanne Neve.The score by Leslie Bricusse is very hummable. I particularly enjoyed "December the 24th," "Thank You, Very Much," "I Love Life" and "Begin Again". Finney is no Sinatra, but his singing voice is equal to his material.Ronald Neame directed this colorful, joyous production.Michael B. Druxman

Is Christina Ricci really dead, killed in an automobile accident, or is she being held hostage by a mad mortician (Liam Neeson) who claims that he can talk his cadavers?That's the question posed in AFTER.LIFE, ostensibly a thriller from director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo.Christina thinks she's alive and so does her boy friend (Justin Long), but Neeson keeps convincing both of them that they're mistaken.After awhile, we as an audience, stop caring one way or another.The actors are all excellent and whereas Ms. Wojtowicz-Vosloo delivers a creepy atmosphere for her well-photographed film, she is unable to create any feeling of suspense. Indeed, this story might have made an effective half-hour episode of TWILIGHT ZONE or a like television series, but at 103 minutes, it really overstays its welcome.From Anchor Bay Home Entertainment.Michael.

SARAH'S KEY is one of the best movies I've seen thus far this year.It is a brutally realistic Holocaust film, but it is also an engrossing mystery that follows two parallel storylines.Kristin Scott Thomas stars as an American Journalist, living in Paris with her French husband and teenage daughter. She is currently researching a story about the French Government's role in rounding up Jews during World War II and sending them to Nazi death camps. In talking to one of her in-laws, Kristin learns that a relocated Jewish family once occupied the apartment in which her father-in-law was raised, and which she and her family are now about to move into. Disturbed by this information, Kristin is determined to discover what happened to that family.Kristin's story cuts back-and-forth with the saga of Sarah (Melusine Mayance), the young French Jewish girl who, back in 1942 when the French police came, locked her younger brother in a closet so that he would not be taken away. This part of the heart-wrenching narrative follows her heroic efforts to escape the death journey to Poland, return to Paris and free her brother.As moving and as well done as this film may be, like all Holocaust movies, SARAH'S KEY is not always easy to watch. The performances are superb, as are the storytelling abilities of Gilles Paquet-Brenner, who directed this adaptation of Tatiana de Rosnay's bestselling novel.The supporting cast of the movie, presented in both English and French (with English subtitles), includes Niels Arestrup, Frederic Pierrot and Aidan Quinn.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

I don't know if Edward De Vere (Rhys Ifans), Earl of Oxford, wrote the plays and sonnets credited to William Shakespeare or not. Nor do I know if Queen Elizabeth I gave birth to illegitimate children.What I do know is that ANONYMOUS is a fascinating, totally engrossing motion picture; a revisionist history, part political thriller, that provides a possible answer to one of the world's great mysteries.Directed by Roland Emmerich, John Orloff's script seamlessly moves back-and-forth between several time periods, as it recounts the tale of a nobleman of questionable birth who writes magnificent plays and sonnets, yet because of the political environment of the era, must let another takes credit for them. Much of the drama centers on court intrigues involving Elizabeth, brilliantly portrayed in her later years by Vanessa Redgrave and, as a younger woman, by Redgrave's daughter, Joely Richardson.I am not going to divulge specific plot details, because that would make me a spoiler and this saga has too many deliciously intriguing twists-and-turns that a viewer should discover for himself.The entire cast, which includes David Thewlis (as the nefarious Robert Cecil), Jamie Campbell Bower (as the younger Edward De Vere) and Derek Jacobi, who bookends the story as sort of a narrator, are magnificent.ANONYMOUS, which has received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design, uses CGI to craft an astounding recreation of Elizabethan England.Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include audio commentary with Emmerich and Orloff, deleted scenes and a featurette, "Who Is the Real William Shakespeare?".Michael B.

FATHER OF INVENTION is a pleasant, but unexceptional, comedy that benefits greatly from the lead performance of Kevin Spacey.At one time, eccentric inventor and infomercial guru Robert Axle (Spacey) was on top of the world. Television viewers were gobbling up his unusual "fabrications," until one of them went very wrong and people were maimed. Axle lost his family, his vast fortune and went to prison for eight years.Now, Axle is back outside and he's not only looking for a new idea that will put him back on top, but also trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter (Camilla Belle).The screenplay by director Trent Cooper and Jonathan D. Crane has some fun moments, particularly in the sequences dealing with Axle's business pursuits, but the personal relationships and secondary characters in the story are, in many instances, poorly defined and lack believability. And, the film's predictable ending seems to fall flat.Heather Graham shines in the supporting cast, playing the angry "lesbian" roommate of Axle's daughter. Also in the cast are Johnny Knoxville, John Stamos, Craig Robinson and Virginia Madsen.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a "Making of" featurette.Michael B. Druxman

There is a lot to like about FERRY TO HONG KONG (1959), now available on DVD from VCI Entertainment.It has an intriguing story, several suspenseful moments, some picturesque Hong Kong locations and a delightful performance by Orson Welles in a definitely unWellesian role.Curt Jurgens stars as a "man without a country," the black sheep of his family, now a virtual bum and a troublemaker, who sleeps on the street and starts barroom brawls. When he's kicked out of Hong Kong, the police put him on a ferry, captained by Welles, that travels back-and-forth to Macao. But, when the Macao authorities won't let him disembark, the priggish Welles, a former conman, is stuck with him...and he hates Jurgens.During the ensuing weeks and revolving voyages, Welles tries everything he can to get Jurgens off his boat, but with scant success. The unwelcome passenger also begins a romance with a sympathetic school teacher (Sylvia Syms) and, eventually, redeems himself with the captain when the ferry encounters a typhoon, followed by a pirate attack.Lewis Gilbert, who directed several of the James Bond films, co-wrote (with Vernon Harris) and directed FERRY TO HONG KONG.Aside from being 15-20 minutes too long, my main complaint with the picture is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or an action film. Virtually the first half of the movie deals almost exclusively with the barbed relationship between Welles and Jurgens, as they exchange banter and Welles continually tries to get rid of his passenger. Granted, there are some funny moments in this long section, but the stakes are not really raised until well after the middle of the film when we get the typhoon, and then in the final third, the pirates' onslaught.Overall, I did enjoy the movie, but a bit of foreshadowing in the screenplay that the tone of the picture was going to be changed would certainly have been in order.Michael B. Druxman

THE SECRET OF SANTA VITTORIA (1969) is a long, but utterly charming WW2 comedy about a small Italian village and its attempt to hide its "pride," a million bottles of precious wine, from the Nazis.Stanley Kramer directed this handsome adaptation of Robert Crichton's novel, which stars Anthony Quinn as the town's drunken "clown," who inexpiably becomes the mayor and chief mastermind in the plot to deceive the German troops. They are led by the honorable, but duty-bound, Hardy Kruger.Also in the fine cast are Anna Magnani as Quinn's wife who initially can't stand the man, yet develops a new respect for him as he deals with the enemy, Virna Lisi as the daughter of the village's once aristocratic family, Sergio Franchi as the peasant soldier that she falls for and Giancarlo Giannini, playing a young villager in love with Quinn and Magnani's daughter.Michael B.

The NC-17-rated (for explicit sexuality) INSERTS (1975) was certainly originally conceived by writer-director John Byrum as a stage play. There are only five characters and the entire action takes place over a two-hour period in one room.Set in Hollywood during the very early 1930s, this mesmerizing drama stars Richard Dreyfuss as a genius director, known as the "Boy Wonder," who has fallen on hard times. No longer able to get work in the "real movies," he lives in his crumbling mansion, never venturing outside and using the swimming pool as his toilet. His house has become his studio where he now makes cheap stag films for money man Bob Hoskins.One day, his leading lady (Veronica Cartwright) overdoses in Dreyfuss' upstairs bedroom. While Hoskins and Richard's leading man (Stephen Davies) dispose of the body, the director, who is ostensibly impotent, spends the time to shoot "inserts" for his film, using Hoskins' "fiance'" (Jessica Harper) as a substitute for Cartwright.There is one bit of hope on Dreyfuss' horizon. A new young actor with star potential has heard about him and wants Richard to direct his next picture. The actor's name is Clark Gable, and he's coming to the house to offer Dreyfuss a job.The only question is: Will Richard let him in?Shunned by the public when it was first released because of its subject matter, this is an excellent motion picture. It has good writing, a fascinating story, strong direction and five award-worthy performances.I can't recommend it too highly.Michael B. Druxman

James Gray is one of the more interesting directors to appear on the film scene during the past few years. His gritty style is reminiscent of Sidney Lumet's, which is a an easy comparison since Gray's first three movies were crime dramas, set in blue collar areas of New York and surrounding areas. Like Lumet, Gray makes his downtrodden locations a "character" in his movies.Gray uses this same dusky style for TWO LOVERS, which is not a crime movie, but a romantic drama.Gray regular Joaquin Phoenix stars as a troubled young Jewish man, drifting through life, living with his parents. Within a couple days, he meets two women. One of them is the nice daughter (Vinessa Shaw) of the man who wants to merge his chain of dry cleaning establishments with Joaquin's father's one man store. After a brief romantic encounter, Joaquin and Vinessa become "boyfriend/girlfriend".The other woman is a neighbor (Gwyneth Paltrow), and she is really screwed up, In fact, she is being "kept" by a wealthy married man who doesn't seem to want to leave his wife, despite his promises.Guess which one Joaquin loses his heart to.TWO LOVERS is the best picture that I've seen thus far this year. It has an intelligent, well-crafted script by Gray and Richard Menello, good direction and fine performances.Isabella Rossellini and Elias Koteas co-star.Michael B. Druxman

Howard Keel was one of the great musical stars of Hollyood's Golden Era.He was also my friend and, for many years, my publicity client.In ONLY MAKE BELIEVE, Howard presents an honest account of his life, revealing many things that I knew and some that I did not know about him. Here you will find inside stories about Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, Esther Williams, Jane Powell, Doris Day and many other stars with whom Keel worked.This is also a story of one of the biggest comebacks in show business history.It's no secret that Keel's career floundered after the decline of the movie musical at the end of the 1950s. With the exception of a few unimportant films, he made his living working in nightclubs and regional theaters. Indeed, he was about to quit show business when he was offered the role of "Clayton Farlow" on DALLAS, a 10-year assignment that would totally revitalize his career.ONLY MAKE BELIEVE is an entertaining, candid autobiography by a man whose great loves were his wife (Judy), his kids, golf and singing. It's a very entertaining read.Michael B. Druxman

Like FIELD OF DREAMS, this is a movie that is going to make grown men cry, because it is a universal story about things left unresolved between fathers and sons.Colin Firth plays an accomplished writer and poet, who comes to his parents' home to spend a few days with his dying father (Jim Broadbent). A country doctor, Broadbent has never openly approved of his son's course in life. There has been an emotional barrier between the two men since Firth was a teenager.Much of the movie, exquisitely directed by Anand Tucker, is a flashback, as Firth recalls how Broadbent often exhibited boorish behavior. He also suspected that Broadbent may have had a romantic liaison with his wife's sister.In the end, as in all relationships between parent and child, some questions do remain unanswered.Juliet Stevenson and Gina McKee co-star in this rich, beautifully photographed drama, adapted from the autobiographical book by Blake Morrison.DVD extras include audio commentary by Tucker and deleted scenes.

SIMBA (1955), which deals with the 1950-1956 Mau Mau uprising in Kenya, is a mixed bag.On the plus side, once it gets going, this Brian Desmond Hurst-directed film is a pretty exciting action thriller that includes several tense sequences. It features a fine cast and, although it appears that the principal players never left England, the second unit Eastman Color photography shot in Africa blends almost seamlessly into the overall film.The story opens with Dirk Bogarde arriving in Kenya from England to help his brother work his farm, only to discover that the Mau Mau have just murdered his sibling. Refusing to let this group of terrorists scare him off, Bogarde elects to stay in Africa and run the farm. He finds romantic companionship with Virginia McKenna, daughter of the owner of a neighboring farm, and a friend in the local police chief (Donald Sinden), whose primary problem is that he can't be sure which of his native officers have gone over to Mau Mau.Produced while the bloody African insurrection was still going on, SIMBA is a film of its time. The attitudes expressed toward the black population by most of the white characters is demeaning, not unlike the negative attitudes expressed toward the Japanese in American films made during World War II. Thus watching this movie today and listening to blacks being referred to as "children" and "animals," certainly makes one feel uncomfortable. Indeed, it probably made more sensitive and enlightened audiences back in 1955 feel uncomfortable, too.If you're going to watch this otherwise well made picture, you must put it into perspective, remembering the time in which it was produced.From V.C. I. Entertainment.Michael B. Druxman

PENNY PRINCESS (1952) is a delightful British comedy, seemingly cut from the same cloth as THE MOUSE THAT ROARED.Yolande Donlan plays a ditzy, blonde New York shop girl who inherits a massive fortune from a very distant relative that she didn't even know existed. Among the assets of the estate is an extremely small European country that is flat broke and whose principal industry is smuggling. Ms. Donlan travels to that small state and is immediately declared to he its ruler, but now she has to devise a plan to put the country on a firm financial footing.Dirk Bogarde co-stars a cheese salesman for a large British corporation, who encounters Yolande and, after a few romantic misunderstandings, helps her achieve her goal.There is so much to enjoy in this movie. It has a clever, satiric story, witty dialogue and the cast is quite likable. Indeed, Ms. Donlan, a Judy Holliday type who played BORN YESTERDAY on the London stage, is absolutely charming and one can't help but wonder why she did not have a major film career.Perhaps it is because she had a long marriage to the film's writer-director, Val Guest, and chose family over career?My only complaint with PENNY PRINCESS is that it ends very abruptly. Suddenly, a character rushes in with a telegram...and "everything" is resolved. It almost feels like the production company ran out of money and they were forced to wrap everything up immediately.That reminds me of a story that I heard Huntz Hall tell years ago. Huntz was, of course, one of the Bowery Boys, and their movies were shot in 7 (?) days. One of these low budget quickies was going into overtime on the 7th day when the producer, Ben Schwalb, called "That's a wrap!""Ben," Huntz objected, "we've still got ten pages of script to shoot.""Nobody'll ever miss them," Schwalb said.He was probably right, but PENNY PRINCESS is not a Bowery Boys movie, and I'd really like to have seen how Guest had originally planned to end this often laugh-out-loud comedy.VCI Entertainment is releasing this nicely restored film onto DVD.Michael B.

Michael Sheen is to Tony Blair what Raymond Massey was to Abraham Lincoln.Massey may have had an acting advantage, since there were no movies or sound recordings of the 16th President that could be used for comparison, but Sheen has certainly employed the modern technology to his benefit. Indeed, there are many moments in his portrayal of the former British Prime Minister when you forget that you are not watching the real man.THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, from HBO Home Entertainment, marks the third time that Sheen has played Blair on screen. Since the plot centers on him, rather than, for example, Queen Elizabeth, his portrayal in this film is much more comprehensive than his earlier efforts.Set against world events, Peter Morgan's script is, in essence, a story about a "student" learning from and then surpassing his "teacher".The "teacher" in this case is President Bill Clinton (Dennis Quaid in a remarkable performance).Clinton was nearing the end of his first term as President when Blair became Prime Minister. There was an immediate rapport between the two men and, both being liberals, they pledged to make their "special relationship" work and together bring the free world to their political way of thinking. Blair stood by Clinton when the President's embarrassing sexual affairs nearly brought down his Presidency, but the two friends butted heads over the war in Bosnia.Directed by Richard Loncraine, this fine film examines the nature of friendship in the world of politics. Hope Davis presents a credible performance as Hillary Clinton and Helen McCrory, as Blair's wife, steals every scene in which she appears.The DVD includes a "Making of" featurette.Michael B. Druxman

A disgruntled screenwriter stormed into director Ernst Lubitsch's office, threw 120 blank pieces of paper down onto his desk and said "Here! Give this the Lubitsch touch!"Obviously, that's a writer's story...but the truth is that when Lubitsch did have a good script...or even a fair one, he was, indeed, able to bring that extra special "touch" to the material, thereby creating a series of risque' sophisticated comedies in the 1930s and 40s that have yet to be equaled. He was never vulgar in his "touches," but employed often hilarious visual suggestions, thus making it quite clear as to what was really going on behind those closed bedroom doors.DESIGN FOR LIVING (1933) was adapted to the screen by Ben Hecht from Noel Coward's play. Miriam Hopkins stars as a commercial artist, who becomes smitten with both Gary Cooper, a struggling painter, and starving playwright Fredric March. The trio decides to live together...platonically...but you can imagine how long that aspect of the relationship lasts...and the problems that it causes. Edward Everett Horton co-stars in this witty, well-played comedy.The Criterion Collection has released a marvelous 2-disc edition of DESIGN FOR LIVING that, aside from a new high-definition digital restoration with uncompressed monaural sound, also includes selected scene commentary by film professor William Paul, an interview with Joseph McBride on Lubitsch, plus a 1964 British television version of the play introduced by Coward and, best of all, the short sequence that Lubitsch directed for IF I HAD A MILLION (1932) featuring Charles Laughton. It was the funniest bit in that picture.Finally, there is a booklet containing an essay by film critic Kim Morgan.Michael B. Druxman

THE SONG OF LUNCH is an exceptional, very unique television drama.The one-hour show is, in fact, adapted from a beautiful narrative poem by Christopher Reid, most of which is presented in a voice-over as stream-of-consciousness thought.Alan Rickman plays a bitter London book editor who is meeting his former lover (Emma Thompson) for lunch at the restaurant they used to frequent. The couple hasn't seen each other for fifteen years. She is now a wife and mother, living in Paris, married to a successful writer, while Rickman, having failed in his artistic endeavors, detests his low level position at the publishing house where he works.The reunion does not go well from the start. Not only has the restaurant changed from what Rickman remembers, but also once Emma arrives, he begins to over indulge in the grape and his attitude becomes surly.Director Niall MacCormick has done a fine job of keeping this low-key drama engrossing and seemingly unconfined, not an easy feat since most of the action is set in the restaurant at a small corner table. And, of course, Rickman and Ms. Thompson are nothing short of brilliant in their roles.THE SONG OF LUNCH is on DVD from BBC Video.Michael B. Druxman

I wish that studios would release the theatrical versions, rather than the extended versions, of their movies onto DVD and keep the once-deleted scenes as deleted scenes in the Special Features section of the disc.That said, I must admit that I laughed-out-loud several times while watching TROPIC THINDER, now available as a 2-disc "Director's Cut" from DreamWorks Home Entertainment. However, I think I would have enjoyed the movie much more if the producers had not inserted approximately 15 minutes of scenes that had been cut from the theatrical release. That extra footage slowed the film's pace considerably and I found myself checking my watch before the movie's halfway point.Directed, co-written by and starring Ben Stiller, TROPIC THUNDER is a very clever send-up of Hollywood, filmmakers and war movies, like PLATOON. Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black play primo dona actors who are starring in a war movie being shot on location in Vietnam. Stiller is a fading action star, Downey is a 5-time Oscar winner and Black stars in gross-out comedies.When the filming falls a month behind schedule after only five days of shooting, director Steve Coogan decides to take his cast further "in country," in order to get more realism. Unfortunately, events don't go quite as planned and the actors find themselves up against an army of deadly heroin dealers.A barely recognizable Tom Cruise, as the picture's producer, and Matthew McConaughey as Stiller's agent, nearly steal the movie from the stars.DVD extras include audio commentaries, multiple "Behind the Scenes" featurettes and deleted scenes.Michael B.

In all fairness, I should reveal that this review is based on only the first four (4) episodes of the 13 episode series.Truthfully, I had mixed feelings about even watching this DVD set at all, because the reviews I had read were very negative. However, a couple of friends told me that they really enjoyed the series, so I decided that watching an episode or two wouldn't kill me.First of all, with the exception of the title and the fact that the show deals with Roman gladiators, this SPARTACUS has virtually nothing to do with the 1960 Kirk Douglas classic.The main problem with this series is that it is trying to outdo both GLADIATOR and 300, thus the violence, blood, gore, sex, which is often one step short of pornography, and four-letter words are so numerous and over-the-top that, at times, they are simply laughable.I'm not quite sure if that was the producer's intent.I'd also be willing to wager that 90% of this series is shot against a green screen.On the other hand, the plot is rather intriguing and it moves along at a fairly nice clip, so I definitely intend to finish watching this first season relatively soon.As a "guilty pleasure," SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND is rather entertaining.From Anchor Bay Entertainment.Michael B.

Beverly Gray has written an engrossing biography of Roger Corman that explores the complex personality of the &#8220;father of independent filmmaking&#8221; with more depth than any other writer has done in the past and, in all probability, will do in the future.As a proud alumnus of the &#8220;Corman School of Filmmaking,&#8221; I had the opportunity to experience Roger&#8217;s well-known frugal ways, as well as his generosity. After reading this book, I now have an even greater understanding and respect for this man who has given dozens of aspiring young artists, as well as a few older ones like myself, opportunities to succeed in what is certainly the most difficult business in the world.An excellent, page turning read.

Filmed at Virginia's Smith Mountain Lake Community, LAKE EFFECTS is a pleasant television movie, enhanced by breathtaking scenery and performances from some likable actors, but marred by predictability and a script that has too many story lines, none of which are satisfactorily developed or resolved.Scottie Thompson stars as a successful Los Angeles attorney who, reluctantly, flies back to her rural Virginia childhood home after her father is killed in an accident. Father (Jeff Fahey) and daughter had had a "falling out" several years earlier, and had not spoken since.Back at the enchanting lake, Scottie must now deal with her sister (Madeline Zima), an art teacher who never left home, and her resentful mother (Jane Seymour), as well as a forgotten boy friend, a mysterious real estate developer that is threatening to foreclose on much or the community and a legendary "sea serpent" that lives in the lake.Directed by Michael J. McKay, LAKE EFFECTS co-stars Eyal Podell, Ben Savage, Richard Moll, Ron Canada, Casper Van Dien and Sean Patrick Flanery.Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include a "Making of" featurette and deleted scenes.Michael B.

Suddenly, a contract is put out on him and his family. Lundgren must now go undercover, and also find out who wants him dead. As Dolph continues to make the seemingly endless number of bodies pile up, he realizes that there is nobody that he can trust.Directed by Lundgren, THE KILLING MACHINE contains a couple of surprising plot twists, but then, during the final twenty minutes or so, the entire house-of-cards collapses when the chief villain's totally unbelievable motives are revealed.This one could have been much better.Michael B.

EVERY DAY is a dramedy about "life," the every day living kind of life.Television writer Liev Schreiber and his wife of nineteen years (Helen Hunt) are finding their lives to be rather difficult these days.Not only has their older son (Ezra Miller) declared that he is "gay," a fact that Schreiber is having problems accepting, but now his cantankerous, incontinent father-in-law (Brian Dennehy) is moving into their home, and Hunt is miserable with that because she and Dad have never really gotten along.Things are just as bad on Schreiber's work front. The egomaniacal producer of his series (Eddie Izzard) is not happy with the scripts that he his turning out, so he assigns Liev to work with another writer on the staff, the very sexy Carla Gugino, who is determined to seduce him.EVERY DAY is a fine, well-acted film, one in which virtually any viewer can identify with and care about the multi-dimensional characters and their various plights. Daily vicissitudes, particularly when one has a family, are not easy. Indeed, as expressed by the film's writer-director (Richard Levine), who based his sensitive script on events in his own life, getting successfully through a day can almost be "heroic".Michael B.

In this seven-episode one-hour NBC-TV documentary series, seven popular celebrities (Sarah Jessica Parker, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Broderick, Brooke Shields, Susan Sarandon, director Spike Lee and football star Emmitt Smith) look back through time, exploring their ancestral histories and sharing their life-altering discoveries.WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? plays like a fascinating mystery, as stars travel cross-country and, in some cases, across the globe to learn the stories of their ancestors.Sarah Jessica Parker, for example, not only discovers that one of her ancestors took part in the California Gold Rush, but that another was accused in, yet survived, the infamous Salem witch trials.In a later episode, her husband, Matthew Broderick, learns that his grandfather was a WW1 hero and that his great, great grandfather fought at Gettysburg.Dallas Cowboys' legend Emmitt Smith traces his roots back to the days of slavery, and even journeys to Africa where his family originated.In what is certainly the most heart-wrenching episode, Lisa Kudrow, who is also one of the series' executive producers, traces her father's family back to Europe where she learns the horrifying facts of how her great grandmother was murdered by the Nazis, but she also meets a distant cousin who managed to escape the Holocaust.Discoveries made by Brooke Shields, Susan Sarandon and Spike Lee are equally fascinating.Aside from being entertaining, this documentary series is also a helpful "how to" guide for viewers who might wish to explore their own ancestral roots. The various historians explain how old census records and visits to libraries can serve as an invaluable starting point for a search into one's past.If the series has a flaw, it's that the individual episodes do not have enough material to fill a one-hour program. This results in a lot of annoying repetition; unnecessary recapping at the start of every segment of material we've already seen.Hopefully, in future seasons, the producers will shoot more footage, perhaps of the subject interacting with his/her immediate family, or if that proves impractical, maybe the show should be cut down to a half-hour length.Michael B.

Ford and Jon Ford, The Dead has some very exciting, suspenseful action sequences and also features some nice scenery.As indicated in the opening paragraph, if you are an aficionado of zombie movies, this one should be your cup of tea.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary from thr Ford Brothers, deleted scenes and a "Behind the Scenes" featurette.Michael B.

Philip Seymour Hoffmann is, arguably, the finest American actor working in films today. Like Spencer Tracy and Gene Hackman before him, Hoffman has a naturalistic style that allows him to inhabit the character he is portraying, rather than simply giving "a performance". With Hoffman, you don't see the wheels turning. True, the actor may have appeared in some unmemorable movies, but his performances in those pictures have never been less than riveting.THE MASTER is no exception. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, this compelling, albeit imperfect film, is set in the early 1950s and casts Hoffman in the title role: a charismatic L. Ron Hubbard-like individual who has created a cult-like belief system, reminiscent of Scientology, that catches on with lost souls who are struggling to find their identities.Joaquin Phoenix plays a troubled ex-G.I. who has problems adjusting to civilian life. Much of the film's action is viewed through his distorted perspective.On the road with no means of support, Phoenix stumbles upon Hoffman's organization, is drawn in and soon becomes his lieutenant, willing to resort to violence in order to protect his mentor. Phoenix is excellent in the picture's central role, which is, actually, much showier than Hoffman's, yet when the pair share the screen, your eyes go to Hoffman.Also in the cast is Amy Adams, quite effective as Hoffman's cold, pragmatic wife; a role unlike the more perky characters she has played in the past.My problem with THE MASTER is that, in the theatrical version, the purpose and underlying philosophy of "The Cause," Hoffman's organization, is never made clear. Yet, in the "Deleted Scenes" that are among the extras on the Blu-Ray/DVD combo from Anchor Bay Entertainment, there is a scene in which the philosophy is explained so that the layman viewer can understand it. It is unfortunate that this scene did not make the final cut in the film itself.Paul Thomas Anderson is a fine filmmaker and, like his earlier works (e.g. THERE WILL BE BLOOD, MAGNOLIA), THE MASTER is involving and enigmatic. Its convoluted ending will certainly have you asking questions. Yet, despite these reservations, what makes this movie worth watching are the Oscar-caliber performances by Hoffman, Phoenix and Adams.Also on the Blu-Ray/DVD is the legendary John Huston documentary, LET THERE BE LIGHT, which dealt with emotionally damaged WW2 veterans and was a strong influence on Anderson in the making of this picture.Michael B.

BAD TEACHER is a mixed bag. [Possible SPOILERS AHEAD]It features a talented cast, particularly the always-deft Cameron Diaz, that certainly know how to play comedy, and it contains several laugh-out-loud moments, but the film is, ultimately, defeated by its very premise.There is not one likable character in the entire film.Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a ruthless, wildly inappropriate middle school teacher who doesn't give a damn about her students or colleagues, and "teaches" by showing her class movies while she sleeps off the previous night's drunk.Why wasn't this woman was fired months ago?After her wealthy fianc&eacute; and his mother dump her, Elizabeth is out to snag another rich husband and she sets her sights on a new substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) who comes from money. Unfortunately for her, Justin is more attracted to Elizabeth's chief rival (Lucy Punch), a triangle that leads to a "war" between the two women...neither of which we, as an audience, are rooting for.Certainly there are moments in this picture that one cannot help but laugh at Elizabeth's outrageous remarks, but these awkward laughs are akin to the somewhat incredulous guffaws we give Larry David and his inappropriate actions on CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM.Elizabeth may "soften" late in the picture, but she certainly doesn't change and nothing in the screenplay by Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg really justifies her "winning" at the film's end.Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and Jason Segel co-star in the movie, directed by Jake Kasdan.Extras on the DVD, which contains both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie, include deleted scenes, outtakes and two "Behind the Scenes" featurettes.From Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.Michael B.

Like his critically acclaimed THE SWEET HEREAFTER, this engrossing film from writer-director Atom Egoyan is a baffling low-key mystery with a surprising, equally quiet, ending.Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth play a Martin & Lewis-like comedy team that, back in the 1950s, was one of the most successful acts in show business. Then, a beautiful woman was found dead in their hotel suite and, though nobody was ever charged in her death, the team broke up soon thereafter.Jumping ahead to the 1970s, a young, attractive journalist (Alison Lohman) has a major book deal that will pay Firth a million dollars if he will talk about his relationship with Bacon and, in particular, the murder. Eager to do the book, Lohman gets close...perhaps too close...to both men, which opens some old wounds that leads to violence and, ultimately, the solution to the mystery.I really liked this movie. It kept me guessing right up until the satisfying conclusion.Bacon continues to deliver stand-out performances. One of these days, he's going to win himself an Oscar.DVD extras include a some interesting deleted scenes and an okay "Making of" featurette.Michael B. Druxman

THE ORPHANAGE is a terrific ghost movie.Not only does it have plenty of moments that will make you jump in your seat, and I can assure you that I did several times, but it also contains a very intelligent, human story that makes you care about the people involved.The exquisitely photographed Spanish-language picture (with English subtitles) was directed by J.A. Bayona and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro. The filmmakers describe it as "a Peter Pan-like story from the mother's point-of-view".Belen Rueda, in an award-worthy performance, stars as "Laura," a wife and mother, who with her family buys the seaside house that was once the orphanage where she was raised. They have no sooner moved into the mansion when her son starts seeing "invisible friends," and shortly after that, he disappears. Laura's husband (Fernando Cayo) thinks the boy was kidnapped, but Laura is positive that he was taken by the ghostly children in the house.Geraldine Chaplin has a strong cameo role as a medium.Leave the lights on for this one.Michael B.

In the very funny MODERN ROMANCE (1981), director and star Albert Brooks reminds us of Larry David in CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM. He makes us laugh, but at the same time we're finding his actions so obnoxious that they're almost painful to watch.Perhaps that's because both Brooks and David bring a strong element of truth to their comedic efforts.Brooks plays a successful film editor, obsessively in love with bank exec Kathryn Harrold. Theirs, however, is not an easy relationship. They continually break-up, then reunite. He grills her about her long-distance calls, storms into her business conferences and does other objectionable actions that would make most women run for the nearest exit...but not Kathryn.Brooks also takes a couple of hilarious shots at the film-making process, and his ultra-short date with another girl is priceless.Michael B.

Though often dismissed by critics as "walking through" his roles, Robert Mitchum) was perhaps Hollywood's most underrated actor. True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum's finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction. His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum's problem is that, if he "rats" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum's "friend," a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style. Mitchum's performance, particularly his first scene in which he explains to a young punk gun dealer how he got the nickname, "Fingers," is unforgettable.The Criterion package contains a booklet of essays on Mitchum and the film.Michael B. Druxman

IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) may not be one of Humphrey Bogart's better known films, but it certainly contains one of his finest performances.Bogart plays a Hollywood screenwriter with a quick, often violent temper, who becomes a key suspect when a star-struck hatcheck girl is found murdered. She had been in Bogie's apartment earlier in the evening, but had departed, as witnessed by neighbor Gloria Grahame.A romance develops between Bogart and Grahame, but the fact that he is still under suspicion slowly decimates the relationship, bringing the writer's darkest side to the forefront.Frank Lovejoy co-stars as the investigating detective, an old friend of Bogart. Nicholas Ray directed.The DVD contains a retrospective short on the film, featuring director Curtis Hanson.Michael B. Druxman

In Samuel Fuller's SHOCK CORRIDOR, newspaper reporter Peter Breck, with the aid of his stripper girl friend (a miscast Constance Towers), fakes insanity in order to have himself committed to a state mental institution where he hopes to solve a the murder of a character (who we never meet) named "Sloane". Indeed, one of the screenplay's faults is that we never learn who Sloane was or why Breck, aside from coming up with a terrific story that might win him a Pulitzer Prize, has such a profound interest in him.Ultimately, Breck learns the identity of the killer, but his time among the "crazies" has taken its toll with his own sanity.The picture, quite shocking when it was first released in 1963, is slow going at first, and much of it is both over-written and, by today's standards, played over-the-top. Yet, the movie does have some powerful sequences and terrific performances delivered by Breck, Gene Evans, James Best and, in particular, Hari Rhodes, playing an African-American patient who believes that he is a member of the Ku Klux Klan.The Criterion release has received a new, restored high-definition digital transfer and is filled with exciting extras, including a one hour documentary about Fuller and 2007 on-camera interview with Ms. Towers.Michael B.

With FROZEN, Adam Green has written and directed a well above average thriller that will keep viewers biting their nails until the final credits...once the main storyline kicks in.The film, released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment, is a clever variation of OPEN WATER (2003), which dealt with an attractive couple being stranded in shark-infested waters. In this case, we have three college students who are trapped on a ski lift on a Sunday night with the prospect of nobody returning to the resort until Friday. To make matters worse, the ground far below them is being patrolled by a pack of very hungry wolves.The virtually unknown cast, particularly Emma Bell, does a fine job of making their characters multi-dimensional, and Green is a certainly a director who knows how to build suspense.On the other hand, the film contains several gruesome scenes. It is not for the squeamish.Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore co-star.The DVD contains deleted scenes and several "Making of" featurettes.Michael B. Druxman

Even though it's sometimes difficult to understand what the actors are saying because of their Australian accents, ANIMAL KINGDOM is, arguably, the best crime drama to come along since Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED (2006).[I also really like Ben Affleck's THE TOWN, so let's say that that's the best American crime drama since THE DEPARTED.]ANIMAL KINGDOM, the debut film from writer-director David Michod, employs a fresh approach to the genre, as Christopher Nolan's MEMENTO did in 2000, and it also features an uniquely compelling set of characters, cast with a superb group of actors who you would not expect to see in these kinds of roles.Newcomer James Frecheville stars as a stoic young man who, following the death of his mother from a drug overdose, goes to live with his grandmother (Jacki Weaver, in a chilling, award-caliber performance).Granny, it seems, is a modern-day "Ma Barker," heading up a notorious gang of bank robbers that include her three sons (Ben Mendelsohn, Sullivan Stapleton, Luke Ford) and their pragmatic friend (Joel Edgerton). When some renegade cops blow one of their number away, a virtual war breaks out between the gang and the police, and Frecheville, basically a decent kid, is caught in the middle. He soon discovers that he is not only a liability to his family, who fear he might squeal, but there are also crooked cops out there who want him dead.Guy Pearce co-stars as an honest cop, trying to help Frecheville make the right decision.ANIMAL KINGDOM is a film filled with surprising, often shocking, plot twists. It is an instant classic of the genre.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has audio commentary by Michod, a "Making of" featurette and a Q&A; with director and several cast members.Michael B.

After going "serious" with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, The Coen Brothers return to the genre of quirky black comedy with this hilarious movie populated with some very stupid people. Interestingly, the actors playing these dodos are usually cast as pretty smart characters.The plot has to do with a disgruntled ex-CIA analyst (John Malkovich), who decides to write his "tell all" memoirs. His wife (Tilda Swinton), who is having an affair with U.S. Marshal George Clooney, is planning to divorce John and, upon advice of her attorney, she copies various files from her husband's hard drive...including his book notes.In a roundabout way, the computer disc falls into the hands of two moronic gym employees (Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt), who blackmail Malcovich for its return. When he doesn't pay, they decide to sell it elsewhere.Events quickly spiral out-of-control as all of the characters' lives converge toward an outrageous climax that is classic Coen Brothers.The entire cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins and J.K. Simmons, is terrific in their atypical roles, but top honors go to Pitt, who may be playing the dumbest criminal ever portrayed on film.DVD extras include a trio of "Making of" featurettes.Michael B.

BURLESQUE is a mixed bag.The musical numbers, which look like they could have been staged by the late Bob Fosse, are plentiful and fabulous, filled with a spectacular, sexy razzle-dazzle. When they are on stage, strutting and singing their stuff, neither Christina Aguilera nor Cher disappoint. They are terrific.The problems with the film, written and directed by Steven Antin, occur when the actors are not singing or dancing.The screenplay is rather trite and the performances, with the exceptions of Stanley Tucci, as the nightclub's gay, sharp-witted stage manager, and Kristen Bell, as the club's hard-drinking lead dancer, are dull. Despite the fact that she screwed up the "Star Spangled Banner," Ms. Aguilera should keep her night job.For the record, the story deals with an Ohio girl (Aguilera) who travels to Hollywood to make good as an entertainer. She maneuvers herself into a waitress job at a hot nightclub, Burlesque, owned by Cher and her ex-husband (Peter Gallagher), which is a stone's throw from being foreclosed upon by the bank. Soon, Christina has not only become the star of the floor show, but she is also being romanced by a ruthless businessman (Eric Dane), who wants to buy Burlesque, so that he can tear it down and build a high rise condo on the land, as well as her "best friend," a young bartender/wannabe songwriter (Cam Gigandet).Guess which one she winds up with while devising a plan to save the club?Alan Cumming is also, very briefly, in the movie, but his one big number was cut from the theatrical release. However, it is viewable in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Other extras include audio commentary by Antin, an alternate opening and a blooper reel.Michael B. Druxman

BABY MAMA is one of the funniest comedies to come along in many months.Written and directed by Michael McCullers, the movie stars the always hilarious SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE gal pals, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, in what is sort of a female version of THE ODD COUPLE.Fey plays a classy, successful, well organized career woman who yearns to have a baby but, according to her doctor, cannot conceive. With the help of surrogate broker Sigourney Weaver, she hires the free spirited Poehler to carry her baby to term, but she gets more than she bargained for when Amy and her n.g. boy friend (Dax Shepard) have a fight and the blonde from South Philly moves in with her.These gals' lifestyles are so diverse that they make Oscar Madison and Felix Unger seem like the perfect pair. Nevertheless, Tina is determined to make the relationship work, because that baby Amy is carrying is hers. Or, she thinks it is.Greg Kinnear, as the "Prince Charming" who enters Tina's life, and Steve Martin, as her somewhat unconventional boss, co-star in the film, along with Romany Malco, Maura Tierney and Holland Taylor.DVD extras include an alternate ending, which we prefer over the one used in the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and some "Behind the Scenes" featurettes.Michael B.

FROZEN RIVER is a gripping drama that features one of 2008's finest performances.Like Bette Davis before her, Melissa Leo is an actress who puts craft over glamor. She's not afraid to let herself appear totally unattractive on the screen if that is what the role requires. She more than deserves every award she's received thus far.In this film, written and directed by Courtney Hunt, Melissa plays a middle-age woman whose husband has just left her and their two sons. She's broke, lives in a broken-down mobile home in frigid upstate New York and works part-time at a local variety store. Her dream is to buy a double-wide mobile home, but hubby has gambled away the money for that.Melissa's life changes when she meets a widowed Mohawk woman (Misty Upham) who survives by smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States from Canada. Seeing this as an opportunity to get her new mobile home, Melissa partners with the woman, but soon finds herself running from the law.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment includes audio commentary by Hunt and producer Heather Rae.Michael B.

As somebody who is not a fan of zombie movies or, for that matter, horror films in general, I must admit that I did enjoy this remake of the 1973 George A. Romero "classic," which I have never seen.Director Breck Eisner and screenwriters Scott Kosar and Ray Wright have created an atmospheric, fast-paced, rather intelligent thriller with three-dimensional characters that evokes more memories of Holocaust movies rather than the films of George A. Romero.The most frightening aspect of this movie is the military, and the way that they treat the people of the affected town. Had it not been for the uniforms, at times I would have thought that I was watching scenes from SCHINDLER'S LIST.Yes, there are zombies, but they are not the mindless kind that you find in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Nor, are they part of a flesh eating "army".These creatures are your friends and neighbors, your husbands and wives, whose exposure to this strange toxin has turned them into killers. That makes them all the more terrifying.One man, for example, locks his wife and young son in an upstairs closet, and then sets the house afire.The action sequences are very well executed and, I must admit that during the movie, I did jump in my seat more than once.Michael B.

Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy & Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton and twenty-two other Hollywood love stories are the subjects of HOLLYWOOD COUPLES, a 5-disc DVD collection from Passport Video. Each program, which debuted on European television, is one-hour in length.I would not have been aware of this documentary series had I not written 3 of the segments [Clark Gable & Carole Lombard, Orson Welles & Rita Hayworth, Laurence Olivier & Vivien Leigh).Essentially presented in chronological order, the episodes, which consist of vintage film clips, newsreel footage, rare photographs and on-camera interviews, begin with George Burns & Gracie Allen, and include Frank Sinatra & Ava Gardner, Howard Hughes & Jean Peters, Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz, Marilyn Monroe & Joe DiMaggio, Tony Curtis & Janet Leigh, Natalie Wood & Robert Wagner, Sonny & Cher, Steve McQueen & Ali McGraw, Paul Newman & Joanne Woodward, Mel Brooks & Anne Bancroft, Clint Eastwood & Sandra Locke, Woody Allen & Mia Farrow, Warren Beatty & Annette Bening, Alec Baldwin & Kim Basinger, Bruce Willis & Demi Moore, Brad Pitt & Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman and Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones.Many of these stories don't end happily and several of them are still being written, yet each one gives a fascinating, in-depth look at two volatile personalities whose pairings captured the attention and imaginations of people throughout the world.Michael B.

The idea of a lazy, not-too-bright guy holding the single vote that will decide a Presidential Election is a terrific over-the-top premise for a classic political farce akin to THE GREAT McGINTY (1940), THE SENATOR WAS INDISCREET (1947) and DAVE (1993).Unfortunately, co-writer (with Jason Richman) and director Joshua Michael Stern opted to abandon the vast comedic potential in this wonderful premise and deliver a serious and rather mediocre melodrama instead.Or, perhaps neither one of them felt comfortable doing a comedy, since their imdb credits don't reflect any meaningful experience in that genre.If that is, indeed, he case, then one must ask: "Why choose a premise that will appear totally ridiculous if it isn't played for comedy?"The very few funny lines in this picture do not appear to be scripted, but improvised by Kelsey Grammer, Nathan Lane and Stanley Tucci, three talented performers, adept at playing comedy, who are totally wasted in this movie.That's not to say that Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper are not fine actors. They are, but neither one of them has that special "gift" for playing a comedic role, thus they are completely miscast in this picture.Costner's role, in particular, is a total misfire, both in conception and execution. For the first three-quarters of the movie, he's playing a lazy moron, then when his "big scene" comes along, he gives an impressive, inspirational speech that his character, as established, could never have written, let alone deliver.SWING VOTE is one of those movies that make me angry because, in the right hands, it could have been great.Michael B.

IN TREATMENT is back for a second season, and the now divorced and living in New York psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne), is not only the defendant in a malpractice suit stemming from the death of one of his first season patients (Blair Underwood), but he also has four new people occupying his couch. They include Mia (Hope Davis), an top attorney who Paul had treated twenty years earlier, April (Alison Pill), a college student denying the fact that she has cancer, Oliver (Aaron Shaw), caught in the middle of his parents' divorce, and Walter (John Mahoney), a successful CEO who is suffering from insomnia. In addition, Paul continues his own therapy with Dr. Gina Toll (Dianne Weist).This half-hour, 5 times each week series from HBO may not be for everybody, but it is certainly one of the best written, acted and directed series on television (cable or otherwise) today.With a minimum of exceptions, the entire show is set in the offices of either Paul or Gina, as they hold their therapy sessions, thus each episode unfolds like a one-act play as the characters reveal more of their inner selves and turmoil.There are no action sequences, no CGI, just two (sometimes three or four) people talking about themselves, their relationships and their problems, some of which are probably not too far removed from our own. That makes for riveting drama.I can't recommend this show too highly.Michael B. Druxman

DIRECTORS:LIFE BEHIND THE CAMERA is not really a movie, nor is it a documentary.It is, in fact, a series of short clips from interviews conducted by, I presume, the American Film Institute with thirty-three major motion picture directors. They include Robert Altman, Tim Burton, James Cameron, Jonathan Demme, Clint Eastwood, Nora Ephron, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone and many others. These interviews are enhanced with occasional film clips and on-camera remarks from various actors and other folk with whom these directors have worked (e.g. Kevin Bacon, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, Leslie Nielsen, Roy Scheider, etc.)The two-disc set is totally interactive. The viewer chooses a topic, such as "Everyone Has to Start Somewhere," or "The Art of Writing and Choosing Scripts," or "The Care and Feeding of Actors," or "Will the Industry Survive," then he can either decided to listen to all of the responses to that subject, or just select the directors that interest him.Although most of the answers are interesting and informative, many are only a sentence of two long and don't really add much to the discussion. I think this package would have benefited greatly from the services of an experienced editor and a narrator, both of whom could have woven this worthy material into a much more involving presentation.Michael B.

Matthew Broderick has the rare gift of comedy.He has the innate timing that allows him to deliver a funny line in the most tense situation, and still get his laugh.That's what he does regularly in FINDING AMANDA, a terrific dark comedy from writer-director Peter Tolan, now available on DVD from Magnolia Home Entertainment.Broderick plays a once-successful television comedy writer on a downward spiral. He's a recovering alcoholic, addicted to gambling and he's about to be fired from the terrible sitcom he's writing.In a desperate attempt to save his marriage (to Maura Tierney), he heads for Las Vegas, promising to bring home his runaway niece (Brittany Snow), who has become a hooker. But, sending Broderick to Vegas is like putting a person with an eating disorder in a candy store.

AN IDIOT ABROAD is a travelogue like none you have ever seen before.Created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, this hilarious television series from BBC Video centers on their friend, Karl Pilkington, a rather laid-back guy who does not enjoy venturing out of his own limited comfort zone.Ricky and Stephen send Karl on a journey to visit the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but what they don't tell him is that, as he visits countries like China, India, Jordan, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Peru, they will also be sending him on some side trips that the average tourist would never even consider taking.In China, for example, this poor guy from Wales is assigned to walk the entire Great Wall, while in South America, he treks into the jungle where he meets a native tribe that could, possibly, be cannibals. Karl's imagination does run overtime.Yet, none of this is really as bad as some of the things he is forced to eat during his travels, everything from bugs to toads to testicles.Gervais says that, with this series, he has played "the most expensive practical joke" in his life. Certainly Pilkington's reactions to the often less than civilized worlds that he encounters are laugh-out-loud funny.For the most part, Gervais and Merchant just appear in the opening segment of each of the eight one-hour episodes (on 2-discs), leaving Pilkington to garner the vast majority of the guffaws. And, there are plenty of those.Michael B. Druxman

I have mixed feelings about this comedy, which is a spoof of the "Inspirational Teacher" movie genre (e.g. DEAD POETS SOCIETY, DANGEROUS MINDS).On the one hand, I found some of it's over-the-top humor to be laugh-out-loud funny, but at the same time, I really didn't like the characters. Talented as the actors were, there was nobody in the film that I wanted to root for.Steve Coogan plays a failed professional actor, running a failing high school drama program in Tuscon, AZ, a place where "dreams go to die". Coogan's failing because, the truth is that he has no talent. His idea of putting on a play is adapting a hit movie (e.g. ERIN BROCKOVICH) into what turns out to be an atrocious stage production.After the school drops Drama from its program, Coogan decides to go out "in style" with his original new take on Shakespeare's greatest play, a rock musical that pushes every boundary and causes a community uproar.Catherine Keener, David Arquette and Elisabeth Shue co-star in the film from director Andrew Fleming.Michael B.

Kim Cattrall drops her SEX AND THE CITY persona and turns in an award-caliber performance in the title role of MEET MONICA VELOUR, now available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.A coming-of-age story, the film, written and directed by Keith Bearden, centers on a dorky, seventeen-year-old recent high school graduate (Dustin Ingram), who lives with his cantankerous grandfather (Brian Dennehy) and worships the movies and pin-u photos of Monica Velour, a gorgeous adult film star of the 1980s.Ingram, learning that Monica (Cattrall) will be appearing at a strip club in rural Indiana, decides to drive there from his home in Auburn, Washington, and see his "goddess" in person. When the aging former sex queen appears on stage, members of the small audience boo her and, after he tries to defend her, Ingram is beaten and she is fired.Monica is a broke, single mother, living in a trailer park and fighting with her brutish ex-husband for custody of their young daughter. Ingram falls desperately in love with her; wants to "save" her from her squalid life. Unfortunately, Monica does not want saving, but she does feel a certain empathy for this young, geeky Don Quixote.Sad, but ultimately charming, MEET MONICA VELOUR is a film with which many viewers will be able to identify.Michael B.

He even offers to give her extra tutoring. But, she won't listen. She "thanks" him by filing sexual harassment charges against him with the university, which not only costs him his tenure but, ultimately, his job.Still, she isn't satisfied.

W. E. is a handsome film, co-written and directed by Madonna, which deals with the scandalous romance between Edward, the Duke of Windsor, and his American Duchess, twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.Like JULIE & JULIA, the picture tells two parallel stories. One deals with Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) an unhappily married woman during the 1990swho is totally obsessed with Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough), and even imagines having conversations with her. Indeed, in one of these fantasy moments, Simpson turns to Wally and snaps, "Get a life!" The other story follows the path of Edward (James D'Arcy) and the woman who caused him to abdicate the throne of England.The actors are excellent, as is Madonna's direction. The problem with this film is that the modern story, which dominates, is really not as intriguing as the historical one, even though we know how that one will turn out. Unfortunately, it's apparent from the start how the fictional Wally Winthrop's saga is going to end also.The movie does, however, make some interesting points about the difference between the legendary "fairy tale" romance and reality.Oscar Isaac, Natalie Dormer, Richard Coyle and James Fox co-star in the film, released in a 3-disc (DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital) set by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but this one really had me. It's the most engrossing horror film I've seen in years.Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely kid, mercilessly bullied at school, whose parents are divorcing. One winter night, he meets Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), a girl who has just moved into the apartment complex and never wears shoes.Abby is a vampire, trapped in a child's body, and her "father" (Richard Jenkins) is actually her protector. Not only does he go out and kill people so that Abby can have blood, but when she does the dastardly deed herself, he disposes of the body.Both friendless, Owen and Abby bond and it is a relationship that endures even after the young man learns the truth about the strange girl.Adapted by director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) from a Swedish novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, LET ME IN is both a horror film and a heart-wrenching tale about the pain of adolescence. Abby may kill people in order to survive, but she is also a victim. She didn't ask to become a vampire.The picture is dark and violent, though much of the blood-letting (wisely) happens off-screen. It is also a love story that will haunt you long after the movie ends.Michael B. Druxman

Violence and gore go way over the top and characters start behaving in very unbelievable ways.Apparently director Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed three of the Saw movies, was trying to appeal to that same audience, but the sad fact is that, with the talent involved here, a more moderate and realistic approach to the material might have appealed to a much broader group of viewers.The screenwriters seem to have borrowed elements from THE DESPERATE HOURS, RESERVOIR DOGS and KEY LARGO in this story about a trio of bank robbing brothers, escaping from a heist that went wrong, who take refuge in their family home, only to discover that their mother doesn't live there any longer. Instead, they find it occupied by a couple, throwing a party for several friends, and they take them hostage.With one of the trio badly wounded from the robbery, they phone their mother, who arrives to take charge of the situation, which involves the terrorizing and torture of the eight hostages, all of whom have their own dark secrets revealed on this horrifying night.The cast is quite good, particularly Rebecca De Mornay, who plays the maniacal mother, but even her fine performance dissipates as the movie's blood fest escalates. It's too bad that these filmmakers have not heard that LESS IS MORE.The 2-disc DVD/Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by the director and actor Shawn Ashmore.Michael B.

Cut from a similar cloth as BEST IN SHOW, writer Jason Micallef's BUTTER is a hysterical, twisted, political comedy that pokes fun at the folks in Iowa to whom butter carving is their whole life.When long-reigning champion butter sculptor Ty Burrell is asked to step aside, obsessive wife Jennifer Garner decides to enter the state contest herself in order to maintain the family's "butter spotlight". However, her virtually guaranteed win is thwarted when the talented Yara Shahidi, a ten-year-old African American orphan, enters the competition and wins the hearts of the judges. Also competing, if only to irk Garner, is stripper/hooker Olivia Wilde, who had a fling with Burrell and is now stalking him for the money she says he owes her.Garner is determined to win the state contest, thus she seduces her dense former boy friend, Hugh Jackman, to do some dirty tricks in order to insure her victory.Deftly directed by Jim Field Smith, the talented cast includes Alicia Silverstone and Rob Corddry as Yara's adoptive parents and Ashley Greene.The Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a gag reel, plus deleted and extended scenes.BUTTER is a hoot!Michael B.

This is not an easy movie to write about.Marc Connelly's play debuted on Broadway in 1930, ran for eighteen months, enjoyed a five year national tour and won the Pulitzer Prize. Unfortunately, today, it's political incorrectness and racial stereotypes makes one want to cringe.Directed by Connelly and William Keighley, the 1936 film, which features an all-black cast, looks at stories in the Old Testament as they might be imagined by black school children living in rural Louisiana. God, for example, is referred to as "de Lawd," and takes the form of an elderly black preacher (Rex Ingram).Perhaps the best story in this episodic fable concerns Noah and the flood. Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, certainly one of the finest comedic performers of his time, plays the good man who builds the Ark.The Hall Johnson Choir supplies lovely Gospel music throughout the picture, which is, at the end of the day, a fine piece of theatre that should be viewed as a film of its time.DVD extras include audio commentary by actor LeVar Burton and some black cultural scholars, plus two musical shorts, one featuring Ethel Waters and 7-year-old Sammy Davis Jr., and the other with The Nicholas Brothers.Michael B.

I always look forward to the next Woody Allen movie.Many of his films are great. Others are very good, and a few are just okay. Personally, I don't think he's ever made a "turkey," though the few films in which he's written a part for another actor and had him deliver his lines in that unique "Woody Allen rhythm" (e.g. CELEBRITY, ANYTHING ELSE) don't really work that well.His latest, VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, is certainly Allen's best film since MATCH POINT (2005). The picture might best be described as "a seductive romantic comedy with a dark side".Best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johnasson) travel to Barcelona, Spain, for a summer-long vacation. Vicky, engaged to be married, is the practical one and Cristina is a failed artist with a free spirit.Shortly after their arrival, the girls meet Javier Bardem, a sexy artist with a jealous ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who immediately invites them to come away with him for a romantic weekend.Vicky is appalled, but Christina is game, so Vicky goes along to keep her friend out of trouble.It isn't long before the handsome Bardem beds both of the girls, but then the unstable Penelope appears on the scene, which definitely complicates matters.Allen has written some marvelous, restrained and humorous scenes for his film, which examines the volatility of human relationships. The scene in which Bardem proposes that the girls go away with him is classic.Director Allen has also extracted fine performances from his cast, particularly Cruz who appears late in the film.Also impressive is Rebecca Hall, who might very well become a major star. Whenever she is on the screen, your eyes are focused on her.Michael B. Druxman

Director (and co-writer) Baz Luhrmann's AUSTRALIA is an epic historical romantic drama, sort of a "Down Under" GONE WITH THE WIND.Set prior to and during World War II, the visually stunning film is long (165 minutes), but extremely entertaining. Nicole Kidman stars as an English aristocrat who travels to the primitive, faraway continent to take over a a cattle ranch after her husband is killed. Hugh Jackman is the rough-hewn cattle driver, who helps Nicole get her herd to market and, ultimately, wins her heart. They make a handsome on-screen couple.Of course, there are villains (David Wenham, Bryon Brown) who try to prevent their cattle drive from succeeding, then there are also the Japanese who bomb the city of Darwin in a very impressive sequence.Luhrmann paints his story on a broad canvas and, in general, he succeeds. However, I think that he should have rearranged the structure of the last 15-20 minutes of his film, because, as it now stands, the final confrontation with the story's lead heavy comes off as anti-climatic.Michael B.

Strange "accidents" and crimes occur in a small farming village in Northern Germany on the eve of World War I. As the incidents escalate, dark secrets of the seemingly peaceful Protestant community are revealed, and the local schoolteacher begins to believe that his students might be responsible for these malevolent events.The children of this German village are members of the generation who grew up to embrace Nazism. Their seemingly passive community is, in fact, a cruel, authoritarian society, primarily controlled by the local Baron, who employs half of its citizens, and the seemingly unfeeling minister.Bitterness proliferates among the powerless, particularly its young people, which makes them the prime suspects when the terrible events begin to take place.On the other hand, as we learn more about the individuals in this village, one begins to wonder if a single person or group is committing these various brutal crimes, or if they are totally unrelated. Virtually everybody seems to have a malicious motive.All of the performances are exquisite; the actors, totally unknown to this writer, appear to have stepped out of early 20th century photographs of rural European life.Like he did with his 2004 thriller, CACHE, director Michael Haneke presents us with an engrossing, deliberately paced mystery, yet he does not give us a precise solution to the enigma. Clues abound, but at film's end, it is up to the viewer to put the puzzle pieces together...if he can.THE WHITE RIBBON is perhaps the richest-looking black-and-white film to come along since color movies became the norm, which is certainly why the cinematography was Oscar-nominated.Michael B.

If you like gritty cop shows, then you will love the Canadian-made INTELLIGENCE. It's as good as THE WIRE, THE SHIELD and HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, which are certainly the most realistic crime series ever seen on television.Set in Vancouver, B.C., the drama takes you inside the murky worlds of organized crime and the cops who keep tabs on it. The leading character (Ian Tracey) is a good father, respected businessman and a major drug smuggler. On the other side of the fence is Klea Scott, the ambitious head of the city's Organized Crime Unit. She not only has the crooks to contend with, but also her colleagues in the intelligence community who are trying to sabotage her information-gathering efforts to bring down the "bad guys".A quirk of fate brings these two key characters together in an uneasy alliance that could help or destroy both.INTELLIGENCE, Season Two (12 episodes/4-discs) from Acorn Media, continues this tense drama, picking up the action where Season One's nail-biting cliff-hanger ending left off.DVD extras include a discussion with series creator Chris Haddock and "Behind the Scenes" clips.

Eugene O'Neill was, arguably, America's greatest playwright and, although plays like THE ICEMAN COMMETH and LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT are probably better known to today's audiences, his mammoth 6-hour long MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA is considered to be one of his finest works.In 1947, veteran screenwriter Dudley Nichols (BRINGING UP BABY, STAGECOACH) adapted O'Neill's 3-part MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA to the screen, cutting its running time to less than three hours. It was a big budget production with an all-star cast from RKO Pictures. Nichols also directed, and that was his mistake.Nichols should have stuck to writing and left film directing to some of his other collaborators, like John Ford or Howard Hawks. Unfortunately, the final movie of the O'Neill work, despite fine performances by Rosalind Russell, Michael Redgrave, Raymond Massey and Kirk Douglas, is very static; no more than a filmed stage play. His exposition scenes are excruciating.Once the exposition has ended however, much of the drama's power does come through. Set in post Civil War America, the play, an adaptation of the Greek tragedy ORESTEIA, tells of an unfaithful wife (Katina Paxinou) who murders her wealthy husband (Massey), only to have her children (Russell, Redgrave) take revenge upon her, then suffer the horrible consequences of their own act.Though Russell and Redgrave both were Oscar-nominated, MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA was a critical and box-office failure. It was soon withdrawn from release. One might say that it was the HEAVEN'S GATE of its day.Virtually unseen for decades and never before released onto home video, MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA is available on DVD (in a restored version) from Image Entertainment.Like the Michael Cimino epic western, the movie's reputation is much worse than the film itself. Concentrate on the drama, rather than the fact that the picture is very uncinematic, and the film should be an interesting and involving experience.Michael B. Druxman

Keira Knightley plays Georgiana Spencer, Duchess of Devonshire, in THE DUCHESS, a handsome costume drama about the woman who, in the late 1700s, was a major celebrity known as England's "Empress of Fashion".The film, directed by Saul Dibb, was adapted from a book by Amanda Foreman and was shot at many actual locations where the real characters once lived.Married at a very young age to the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a cold man who only wants a male heir from her, Georgiana is not only forced to put up with her husband's cruelty, but to also share her home with his illegitimate daughter, and later his new mistress.Ultimately, the unhappy woman begins an ill-advised affair with future Prime Minister Charles Gray (Dominic Cooper), but must soon choose between him and losing her children.Charlotte Rampling and Hayley Atwell co-star in this fine film about a vivacious and, ultimately, heroic woman who was a victim of her time.The DVD from Paramount Home Entertainment contains some excellent "Behind the Scenes" feaurettes, including one that gives us insight into the real Georgiana through her own letters.Michael B.

TALES FROM THE SCRIPT should be required viewing for anybody who even thinks that they might want to write and sell a screenplay.Frankly, had director Peter Hanson's superb, sobering documentary been around forty-five years ago when I first began my assault on Hollywood, I might have had second thoughts and chosen another path in life.Naw!I was young and foolish back then. Nothing was going to stop me from scaling the "brick wall" that the folks in this film talk about. All you needed was talent and a hard head to protect you from an infinity of rejections.[Actually, I didn't really scale the wall, but I did find a way to sneak around it.]Hanson's film is, for the most part, a series of "talking heads," but those heads belong to some of the most knowledgeable and successful screenwriters in the motion picture industry, including William Goldman, Shane Black, John Carpenter, Frank Darabont, Bruce Joel Rubin, Paul Schrader, Ron Shelton and many more.The writers discuss their successes and failures, how they broke into the business, the problems dealing with studios, directors and stars, and how they cope with their carefully-crafted work being re-written by others.The writer lives a very tenuous life in Hollywood, and once their script is finished, even the most successful and revered must accept the fact that they are expendable.TALES FROM THE SCRIPT was based on an idea by Paul Robert Herman. It is, without doubt, the best film ever made about screenwriting.The DVD from First Run Features contains another hour of equally fascinating bonus features; advice and wisdom from these professional screenwriters.

Essentially a chase story, SERAPHIM FALLS is a fine, action-filled, gritty western in the classic tradition.When we first see Pierce Brosnan, he's a lone figure atop the snow covered Ruby Mountains, warming himself at a campfire. Suddenly, two shots ring out, one of which hits him in the arm. Pierce can only run, sliding down the mountainside; ultimately falling into an icy rushing river and being swept over a steep waterfall.His pursuer is Liam Neeson who, with his hired guns, has been after Brosnan for years. We don't learn his reason until late in the film which begins in the mountains and winds up in a parched desert.Co-written (with Abby Everett Jaques) and directed by David Von Ancken, Seraphim Falls is beautifully photographed by John Toll, and co-stars Anjelica Huston, Michael Wincott, Ed Lauter and Wes Studi.My only problem with the film was Ms. Huston's role which, since it changes the tone of the story, would have worked better had it been introduced earlier in the picture.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment features audio commentary by Brosnan, the director and production designer, plus an in-depth "Making of" featurette.Michael B.

I've always felt that RESCUE ME was one of the best written, directed and acted series on television, but the creators faltered during this 5th Season.There are still some truly memorable moments in many of the episodes. A scene between Andrea Roth and Callie Thorne in the firehouse still brings a smile to my face every time I think about it, as does a sequence with the guys at a supermarket.I think that the problem with this season is that it ran 22 episodes, rather than the usual 13, and the writers/producers did not come up with enough story to fill it. Thus, the plot moves forward at a snail's pace, and there are too many scenes which are just marking time.The season finale is certainly a cliff-hanger.Hopefully, Season 6 will be better.Michael B.

HOUR OF THE GUN (1967) was the first movie to ostensibly tell the true story of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Earlier, better know films like John Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and John Sturges' GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, also dealt with the subject but were more fiction than fact.Sturges also directed this picture, which starred James Garner as Wyatt, Jason Robards as Doc Holliday, Frank Converse as Virgil Earp and Sam Melville as Morgan Earp. The intriguing screenplay by Edward Anhalt, which opens with the legendary gunfight, dealt with the bloody aftermath of that event and has Wyatt seeking revenge against the men who later ambushed his brothers.Robert Ryan co-stars as Ike Clanton in this well-made action-filled western from MGM/UA Home Entertainment.Michael B.
