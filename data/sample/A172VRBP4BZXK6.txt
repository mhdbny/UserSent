Eragon takes the diamond home hoping he can get some money out of it. Little did he know the diamond would change his life forever.What i liked about this book is the sensce of adventure ythat you get while your reading it.What i disiked was about this story is that it leads into the next book and you have to wait for the next exciting book in the series. Otherwise I disliked nothing else.If you liked the Wheel of Time series or the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you'll definitally love this book.

this book is about a simple and normal boy that finds a dragons egg and hatches it. (...)This book is amazing! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the lord of the rings and harry potter series. Eragons adventure is sure to keep you well interested and you wont want to stop reading. Just when you think that you have figured everything out a new twist is added unexpectedly. I personally can't wait untill the second book calledupwelling is published. I would give this book a five out of five.There are supposed to be two more books in this series and like a said earlier the second book is called upwelling and is going to be published sometime this year.(...)

You can not put this book down! For there is a lot of action and a favorite wizard Gandalf. You know from the movie &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;Well I give The Hobbit four stars out of five. My reasoning for this is because some parts get dall and you can't wait untile it is over; but then agian some parts you can not put this book down because of all the action.The Hobbit is like a spin off of the book &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; because it has Bilbo Baggins going on this crazy adventure with the dwarfs to get reveng on a dragon. On the way to persue the dragon they have absocales to face in which caves to exploer and such. Well I enjoyed The Hobbitand if you pick it up and read it am sure you will like it too.

I really did not like this book. There wasn't much interest in it and I did not enjoy this kind of book. There was only one part that was actually good. That was when 13 dwarves came to the service ofBilbo Baggins. Then they tell him he needs to go on an adventure. In this adventure he will face a fierce dragon. He then sees goblins but I can't tell you all of the book so you will have to read it.

This is the third book in the Lord of the Rings series. It tells how the ring is destroyed, and answers a lot of questions that you may have had in your head from the first two books. It really had only a few interesting parts. It is a drag between the cool parts. They talk about things that already happened in the other books. And it is confusing. In the second half, they talk about things that happened in the first half, and say they have not yet happened. You will like this if you want to find the ending of the Lord of the Rings, but otherwise, probably not.

THE RETURN OF THE KINGBY; J.R.R. TOLKIEN*****This book jumps into two sections. In the first section the main characters are Merry, and Pippin two Hobbits, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn the Ranger, Th&eacute;oden the King of Rohan, Eomer, Eowyn, and Faramir. In the second section it is Frodo, and Sam also Hobbits. The first part of the story with the first characters they are fighting to save the city of Gondor. They fight against man, orcs, and other horrible creatures of the Dark Lord Sauron. In the second half it is about Sam finding his master Frodo deep inside the land of Mordor. Frodo and Sam must make there way past Sauron's army and make it to the fires of Mt. Doom. With each step the burden of the Ring of power on Frodo grows. It feels much heavier. It's taking control of him. Will Frodo make it to Mt. Doom? Will he be able to cast the ring into the fires or will its hold on him be his downfall? There is a third part and the Hobbits that are living return home and find out they have to save that as well.This story has good strengths. It all played out. I would suggest reading the other books first. There weren't many weaknesses in the story. I couldn't find any. But if you don't like the jumping around then I wouldn't suggest it to you.I would recommend this book to you if you like the myths of the world along with humans mixed together in the fight to survive.

The book Crooked was a great book that was about a girl namedClara Wilson. Clara is a 15 year old girl who is having many troubles with her social life. She loses her best friend when her friend is accepted by a group that Clara will never be in. Along with her social life disasters her parents are having difficulties. Her father is always out of town and her mother doesn't know what to do with herself. When her mother gets offered a job in Spain Clara has no idea what she should do next.Then she meets a boy named Amos Mackenzie who, it seems, is having the same problems she is having. He had lost his father of cancer and, just like clara, has no idea of what to do next. When these pair meet up the trouble begins.I liked this book a lot because it was a book that people my age can relate to. I also liked it because it is very realistic because the things that happen in this book happen in real life. The only thing that you have to watch for is the change of view points which happen every chapter.

I gave it 4 stars because it was a good book. It as easy to follow about what is going on. It was about this guy named Travis. His dad went away do he had to take care of the farm. His dad told him if he does that he might get him a horse. But his dad his dad said that he needs to find a good trustwerthey dog first. well his dad leaves and he is the man of the house. After a few days along came a dog and Travis desided to keep it and he called it Old Yeller because it was a yellow dog. Old Yeller was such a good dog that if Travis got into a little pickle Old Yeller would help him get out of it. Something bad happens to him/the dog and the dog might not save him or Travis save the dog. His dad comes home and shows him his good dog. It could do many things that a good dog can do. And his dad said son that is the best dog i have ever seen. You will have to read the boko to see if he gets the horse he is dieing for for many years now. I would read the book agian anytime. If you like Country books, Outdoor books, Animal books, Hunting books, this book is for you!!

If you like strange, mystical, and action you might like this book, The Fellowship of the Ring. The first of three book series.It is about a young hobbit named Frodo who has just inharitted everything from his uncle Bilbo. Including a ring with evil powers seaching for its master. Frodo has to destroy the ring. The problem is it can only be destroyed at the place the ring was made.I gave this story 4 stars. I took one away because there is a lot of talking in this story, and at some points it can be a little confusing.

This book was the best book I have ever read. It related to my life very well. The girl on there that was the narrator had almost the exact same thoughs that I had. I liked the way the narrator wanted the sex god and the wau she tried to get him with all her different sly skeems. I recommend this book to anyone who has a troubled relationship with others. At the end of the book the narrator chose exactly who I would have chosen and when she chose him it almost made me cry. The process was so beautiful I felt a tear disperse from my eye, down my cheek, and off my chin.

This book is about a 16 year old boy named Garrtey, who signed up for this walk. The walk is around 180 miles. Garretty and 99 other people were sitting in the grass when the Lieutenant came to give them their numbers. Garrety was number 47. the walk was very difficult, and so were the rules. You couldn't stop, if you get 3 warnings you were shot. If the person needs more water, the solider would go and give them a new canteen. The winner (or the first person to cross) wins a $10,000 cash prize plus a wish of whatever he or she wants.I think that the book had some strengths because it was pretty good and that it was written pretty good and it described the people really good. When he wrote it, it made you feel like you were actually in the book.If I were to compare this book to another one, I don't know what I would compare it with, because I haven't read any books about a people walking to and risking their lives trying to get a prize.I would recommend this book to people who like a little action, and suspense because you don't know what's coming up next. This book has some suspense because you don't know who's going to get shot next, and if who's going to make it.

In this book,which I really liked, I really connected with the girl, Sally, who grows up in 1947. She is 12 years old and says the wrong things at the wrong time. Sally, her mom, her brother, moved to Florida while her dad stays in their homestate, New Jersey. So Sally has to make new friends and get a long with her new classmates. The funniest part of the book was when Sally daydreams and makes up stories about Hitler, Latin lover, Lila, and of course the famous Ester Williams of the 1940's. This is a really great book. I loved it!

This is about a woman named Clarice Starling and her life working as a FBI officer. Clarice is the best FBI officer there ever was in Washington. Here she will face the biggest challenge of her life. First she must get out of trouble she is already in after a drug bust. Now she must meet a cannibal. She met this person once before and will face him again. She met him a long time ago and put him in prison for a while. His name was Dr. Hannibal Lector.I do like this book, because it fits me, well short of. It is an action packed book with some grouse, bloody scenes. I saw the movie to this book before. This book as well as the movie contains a lot of action right from the start of the book.. The reason why I didn't like this book is because it does contain some romance and some old time stuff or past history tings as some of us will put it.This is a good book for most of you people out there.

The Body of Christopher Creed is a book about a geeky 17-year-old at school. Nobody really ever liked him, nor payed attention to him except for when the bullies beat him up. But one day he suddenly disapears. Now everybody cares just enough to think, "where is he?", "Is he dead", "Did he commit suicide?" Answer these any many more questions as you read this book yourself.I thought this book was pretty good. The author did a great job in keeping you in suspense. the writer sucks you into the book until the end. At the end, you'll find a nice surprise. So overall, I liked it and defintely recommend it to all.

This book was written by Will Hobbs, who's also written Down the Yukon, Jason's Gold, The Maze, Ghost Canoe, and Far North. The story is about a boy who's father was an archeologist. Years ago Andy's father was on a trip in Alaska trying to find evidence of the firs people in north America. He was with another person but he slipped and fell. Now Andy was in Alaska looking for the Island that this father had died on. He's on a kayaking trip with a group of people but during a storm Andy is swept way off course and lands on what seems to be a deserted island. Until he sees a mysterious man with wild looking beard and dressed in bark and animal skins. Andy decides to find out who the man really is while trying to survive wind, rain, and mind numbing cold, along with the local grizzly bears.One of the strong points of this book is the suspense. There's always twisted that keep you reading and wanting to find out what happens next. The book also seems really realistic. Will Hobbs seems to know a lot about the outdoors and surviving and you can tell in the way he writes this book. I've never read any of his other books but after this one I think that I would enjoy another of his books.There was one thing that I didn't like about this book was that there wasn't really a whole lot of action. There was plenty of suspense, like I said before but the suspense was more from the plot and not from something that is physically happening to Andy. He never really gets in any fights or any action like that. Otherwise this book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes outdoors books.

There is a farm called Manor farm. On that farm there is a guy called Mr.Jones. One night he for got to feed the aniamls.The animals kicked down the fence and drove the humans out. The animals are now working as humans. The animals on the Manor farm did not like each other. They always had a commander on the farm as a leader to lead them. The pig were first to lead them. Then Napoleon anther pig would be able to take to the humans.I would tell you that Animal farm is a great book if you like to read about farm animals. Their job in the book is like it is on a farm. The horses work to pull equipment and the cows give the milk. The animals can be like humans.There wasn't much about the book I didn't like. It is not really like any other book I've read recently.

HAUNTED OHIO 4 is a book full of short stories about ghosts. These stories are true, as told by the people who experienced them. These hauntings are from all over Ohio. There are stories about pets that come back to haunt, ghosts who leave things such as money, and ones who take things like macaroni.I liked this book because it really makes you wonder if ghosts are real, and if there really could be haunted places. One thing I didn't like about this book was that there is too much extra detail, which lets your attention drift away from the book.In my opinion, HAUNTED OHIO 4 is a good book that should be read by anyone who likes ghost stories.

This is a great book for people that like ghost stories. Some of the stories are good and some of them are dumb. A good story is the one about the hidden driver.Some of the ones that are bad is the one were some people hear a noise and they think that it was a ghost. It is kind of a hrd book to under stand, but over all it is a good book. The book is about Chris Woodyard going around Ohio and finding ghost stories. I have read a similiar is called the Bone Collecter. It is about a murder that kill people and leaves a bone clue.I think that you should at least read one of the hauted ohio books.

Tomorrow, When The War Began is a great book. It is told by one of the main characters Ellie. A group of seven teenagers takes a camping trip to Hell. It's not really Hell, it's just a place that is isolated from the rest of the town. They have to travel down "Satan's Steps" to get there. The teens return home only to find that their country has been invaded. The group runs into another friend. They load up supplies and go back to Hell, now as a group of eight. I like this book because it is full of excitment. It keeps you on the end of your seat to the very last page. This book os also full of drama and a little bit of romance. There really wasn't any part of the book that I disliked. This book is unlike any others I have read. I loved this book and recommend ot to all teens, boys and girls.

The Dragon Reborn is the third book in The Wheel of Time series, after The Eye of the World and The Great Hunt. This book is a great addition to this series. I enjoyed the whole book and thought that nothing in it was bad. If you like fantasy, you will definitely enjoy this series and this book. This book has action, mystery, and even magic.Rand al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn, and he is unable to control his ability to channel the True Source, the power that turns The Wheel of Time. He knows he must face the Dark One when the Last Battle comes, but he is afraid. He also knows he must fulfill the prphecies written about him. This book also includes the corresponding adventures of the other characters:Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, Elayne, Moiraine, Lan, Min, Thom, and Loial. This book is good throughout all of the pages, and the action at the end really ties the book together.If you've read Tolkien and Harry Potter, pick this book up.

Do not think that because you saw the movie you don't need to read the book. The book is better. it has a lot of action and suspense. It is quite long but worth reading. The basic plot is that there is a lot of people with very different backgrounds that are trapped on an island with a bunch of geneticly engineered dinosaurs that want to hurt them. And to top it off the power is out. If you like Sci-Fi thrillers read this book.

Flipped was mainly about a boy named Bryce and a girl named Julianna. Bryce was a new kid in the neighborhood and just so happened to move I right across from Julianna. She seems to have some really strong feelings for Bryce. He is to shy and just plain is terrified of her. Will they ever like each other?I was really interested in this book, because it kept me asking for more. Every time I was supposed to go to bed I would end up reading past that time. I really also enjoyed it because it was about a boy and a girl who grow to be my age throughout the story. Julianna seems to have a lot of characteristics that seem to relate to the way that I act. She likes to go overboard in trying to make Bryce like her, so she can finally get her first kiss. This was what made the book such an attention grabber. It seemed that when I started that I would have to read till the very end on the first day. Another reason that this book was so good was the fact that the narrator switches from Bryce to Julianna every chapter. It lets you hear both sides of the story. It kind of makes you wonder who is telling the truth and who is lying. All in all this was the best book I have ever read.

The book Flipped is about two neighbors, Bryce and Juli. It starts out as Juli having a mayjor crush on Bryce but he hates her! He tries everything to get her to stop liking him. Bryce does some stupid things during the seven years that she likes him. Finally Bryce sees the true side of Juli. The roles get flipped when Bryce starts to like Juli and Juli hates Bryce! I really liked this book a lot. I especially liked it when Juli would not get out of the tree because she liked it so much. Also I liked the fact that the cover really makes you think about what it is about. I thought the book was really funny which is something that I like about books. I thought the part about the basket boys was funny and really cute. Something that I really enjoyed about Juli was that she has so much determination. When she wants to get something done she does it and doesn't just talk about it. Also I liked the part when you learn about Juli's family background. One thing that I didn't like was that one chapter was Bryce telling his side of the story and the next was Juli retelling the story in her own words. I think many people like this book. The book really leaves you hanging. What will happen with Juli and Bryce? Will they have a future together? Find out by reading the book Flipped.

The book that I read called One Last Kiss by Judith Kelman was one of the most exciting and threatening book tthat I have read in my life. It's about a little girl who was splitted up from her mom for about 3 years. A year or so later Thea Harper was back in jail and her daughter was taken away. Another 5 years later thea and her daughter was back home. While that same nght she woke up with blood all over her hands and did not know what had happened.There were a little bad things in it like murders and good things like when Gabby was back home with her mother.To me this was a very good book. It explains things really well and you will get a hand of it.

If you like a book with suspense and want a book that you just can't put down this is a book for you. Locked in Time is about girl named Nore, her parents are divorced and her mom died so she has to move in with her dad and his new wife and two kids. The reason I gave this book only four stars was because you kind of can figure out what's going on and it kind of ruins the book because you know the main reason of the book. The book is still a good book and I highly recommend it.

You have to watch out for moose and watch out for the harsh wind and cold. I rated this book five stars because this book is written so well i highly recommend this book for any reader that loves an adventure.This book also shows that you have to trust your instincts and those who are running it with you.This book is excellent.

I gave The Pact five starts because it had a very good topic and it relates very well to various situations that different aged people go through. The book was set up in a weird way, at first it was kind of hard to figure out where the story was going and who was the narrorator. I like the way the story twisted in all directions throughout the whole book. I liked The Pact a lot because it was a page turner with new information that we didn't know before one every page. Once I started reading this book I didn't want to put it down.

You will like this book because it is very adventurous. This is a good book because once you get started you can't put it down. I' m a lover of Gary Paulsen's Brian series. Every time a new book comes out I'm always the first person to get it in the library. To understand this book you might have to read the two books before this one to figure out about why he is where he is in this book. This book is about Brian and he is camping and he sees a dog. The dog is wounded and he is having trouble getting up. Brian goes over to see what is wrong and he sees that the dog is hurt. Now Brain is going to hunt for the person or thing that has hurt this dog. The dog also comes with him as his new partner to hunt. Some things that I like about this book is that it is very adventurous. It has a lot of things about what to doing the wilderness when you are camping and something goes wrong. Overall I think that you will love this book about Brian's Hunt.

I enjoyed this book because it was about animals and hunting. There is a lot of action and adventure. There are a lot of true things like how a fox hunts and it taught me a lot about how dogs find a sent in a woods. Also how a coon or a fox would try to trick a dog.What I didn't like about the book was it had too many jumps from one charter to another. The dog would hunt from his point of view then the next chapter the fox would be in the same hunt that I didn't like.Kox

The book Sin Killer is not a very good. The book is pretty much pointless. In Sin Killer it did not give very much information and it was not clear. It talked about where they were going but the author jumped around on many subjects. The author would be talking about one thing then all of the sudden he would be talking about else. I would reccommend this book to people that are older mature and can read very well. I think this book was more written for adults than young adults. This book was mainly about a girl who moved to America. When they got there they bought a steamboat and started to travel the rivers of the west. It talks about what goes on the in the wild west and the adventures they have. This bookis best suited for adults.

I sort of liked this book. It did have a lot of descrition and a really good story line to it. It also had imagination to it the was really good. I didnt like some on the names rhe were used because they were really wierd like Fflewddur and Gwystyl. Some of the book was really hard to understand because i didnt read the books leading up to this one, even tnhough the author said it would be ok to do this. I also didnt like how much it skipped around. I mean at one point you were with one caracter and in the next chaper you were with a different caracter in another part of there country.

The man that died was named sam Westing. There was this judg named judg Ford. Judg Ford gets 16 people together to see which one of them murderd Sam Westing. At the beginning there is this man named Barny Northwrop who goes around putting letters under peoples doors to tell them that they can move into an appartment in the Westing bulding. Everyone moves in the apartments and thats when they realize that that they moved there to find out who killed Sam Westing.There is this legend going around that Sam Westings remains are in his house.

Sloppy Firsts by Megan McCafferty takes you into the journal and life of sophomore Jessica Darling. Jessica is a regular, American teenager struggling with boys, school, her parents, and most of all the fact that her best friend just moved away.Sloppy Firsts has become my favorite book in just two weeks. The main character is so relative, and the situations and cliques she's involved in and struggling with are problems I face everyday. It's funny, heart-filled, and outrageously fantastic. If you're a high school, teenage girl, you don't want to miss this book. Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down. You laugh, you cry, and most of all, you have fun!

Sloppy FirstsBy: Megan McCafferty* * * * *Sloppy Firsts is one of the best books I have ever read! I would suggest this book to any teenage girl! That's probably the only bad thing about this book: guys won't enjoy or understand it as well as girls. If they do read it though, they would learn a lot about girls!Jessica Darling is the main character. She feels like she has no life after her best friend. Hope moves away. But she does have a life; a very complex life! Jessica thinks just like any other teenage girl: about friendships, school, her social life, her looks, and other things that you will love to read about. This book is basically Jessica's journal with some e-mails to Hope. So it is neat to follow along with her life as it happens.Whenever everything seems to go wrong in her life, Jess runs into Marcus Flutie. He becomes a big part of her life. She has always said that her boyfriend should be like a "male Hope". That's exactly what Marcus is because him and Hope are the only ones who truly understand her, but Jess just cant make herself realize that.....until the end.I believe that any teenage girl will be able to relate to this story. It will make you laugh out loud the whole time your reading. It also makes you think about your own life and how to handle your problems. You will find yourself trying to be a better friend and realizing who your true friends are!

I recently read the book Sloppy Firsts. The novel was so well written, that I just had to read the sequel. The sequel, Second Helpings, was also very well written. It went right along with the first novel, picking up on details and bringing them back into the sequel. The series is very down to earth. Young adults, mainly girls, can relate to the books in many ways. Second Helpings brings back Jessica Darling for her senior year at Pineville High. You see the same characters in Second Helpings that were in Sloppy First. There are many unexpected twists between characters, gluing your eyes to the pages. If you are dying to know what happens between Marcus and Jessica, this is a must read!

A boy and his brother live on a farm with their parents in a small town. One day the main character goes and works in a field on their farm. His little brother wants to join him so he comes and gets on the tractor with his older brother. The little boy wants to drive but his older brother won't let him so he tries anyway. He falls backwards off of the tractor and dies because he gets tore up in a plow. A while later the boy goes to a baseball diamond that's near his house. He finds other boys about his age playing and thats when he falls in love with baseball. Some things I liked about the book was that it starts right off with action when the boy is thrown from the tractor. Some things I didn't like were that the story is not totally focused on baseball right from the start like I was hoping, but that isn't such a bad thing and that is why I gave it a four-star.

This book is about Jed Berg, a junior in high school, that has everything going for him. That is, until a punk chick Geretrude tells him an astounding secret that will change his life forever. In this romance/suspenseful book, Jed goes through a test of bravery, trust, secrets, and love that will teach him what life is really about.One thing I liked about this book was that it really showed how much reality is really in everyone's life. It shows that no matter how great everything is going for you, it can be just as easily destroyed in the amount of time it took to build it up. A couple of things that I didn't like about this book was that it was hard to get into in the beginning. It just kept on going on and on about things that didn't matter in the plot. I also didn't like the ending of the book because it made no closer to the problem in the book.This book is similar to no other book I've ever read.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action, suspense, and somewhat romantic books. This book can be for a boy or girl.

They hold the fairy hostage for one ton of twenty-four caret gold in exchange for the fairy and to not reveal the fairy race.

It al comes down to if the fairy will get out of the hose before the bio-bomb explodes, will Artemis and company survive the bio-bomb, will the secrets be concealed, and will Artemis make a fortune.My likes about this book is that it managed to make me want to keep reading to find out what happens, and that you could never guess what was going to happen next. My only dislike is that the book starts out kind of slow.

For the Amazon Reading project I read the book Armando's Treasure by Melody Carlson. This book is a very good book if you're into slight mystery. I would rate this book four stars, it was interesting but not totally mind blowing. It's about a Hispanic boy named Armando Garcia who has ran away from his home in L.A. He arrives in a little town called Treasure and is attracted by an old pick up truck that was a little rusty but it was better than his own two feet. As he was checking out the car the little old lady named Dora Chase that owns the truck and the property he was on came out with a shot gun threatening to shot. Armando gently calmed down the lady convincing her that he met no harm. Dora has a broken arm and was in very much pain so Armando took her into her own house and gave her a pain reliever pill. As him and Dora were talking Dora's son came over and started yelling at Armando to get out of their house. Charlie (Dora's son) wanted Dora to sell her land to a factory, but Dora wouldn't because it used to be her husbands before he died and he gave everything to get the little farm working. Throughout, the story Armando meets Dora's grandchild Olivia, who is a very pretty girl, that Armando instantly falls in love with, but Olivia has a bad habit of smoking and drinking and also has a boyfriend that is an artist. Armando stays around the house to help out Dora incase her son tried to steal the property again. While helping out he makes himself at home and starts getting the farm running again, piece by piece. He builds Dora a pond and puts fish and plants all around and in it. Charlie was so furious at Armando that he looked up history on him and found out that he was wanted for possession of half a million pounds of cocaine which is the reason he ran away from home. Before Armando can get into trouble he takes off and starts heading back home but Olivia chases him down. Did Armando really commit a crime? What happens to him and Olivia? And then again what happens to the little farm that Armando was trying to get started again? You'll just have to read the book to get the answer.Some things I liked about this story was that it was an easy to read book even though it was a thicker one, also it I also liked how it had such a good moral and it really made you think about things in your life and how much you take for granted. Some things I didn't like about this book was how it took so long to actually get going, in the beginning it got into really great detail that wasn't to interesting to read about.Armando treasure wasn't like any other book I've read it had it's own little version of life and the way things work which is another thing I liked about it , how it didn't base itself off any other book.

Flint McCallister is the leader of a four man flag football team. Throughout this book Flint and his two teammates are trying to find a replacement for their hiker, Cade Savage. Cade is turning into a nonstop partier and Flint and his teammates can't take it anymore. Cade doesn't show up for practices or games but still thinks he is part of the team. The team interviews several people and they have to decide if they really want to kick Cade off the team, and if they do, who is going to replace him. This is a very well written book but I think there could be more details describing the setting throughout the book. This book will keep you guessing and once you pick this book up you won't be able to put it down until you're finished.

If you like spies and espionage, this would be a book for you. Ai! Pedrito! starts out a little slow and has a loose plot but, in the whole time there is something happening. This book provides a good mental image of what is happening almost like a movie. This book was a joy to read along with a funny twist. What do you think would happen if a South American revolutionary terrorist leader would switch places with an elegant, proper, and an identical twin of him that was a high ranked Naval Intelligance Officer? To find out you need to read this book. It will keep you guessing the whole way through.

Witch Child is a book about a young girl whose grandma was tried because she was a witch. She was sent on a journey to the New World because her grandmother wanted to protect her. On her journey to the New World she met a new friend named Martha. Martha was Mary Newbury's best friend and like her mother. When Mary got to the New World she met a little Indian boy named Blue jay. They would meet in the woods and talk and exchange goods.Overall the book was great. The best part of the whole book was when they got to the New World and began to build there new village. Some of the weaknesses of the book were that at some parts it got a little confusing. If you find any confusing then I would advise you to go back and read that part again or else you would be really lost.I would recommend this book to anyone who is over the age of 12. I am 14 and I really enjoyed reading the book. I had the book finished within 5 days because it grabbed my attention. I also do not like to read at all, but this book really grabbed my attention

The Eye of the WorldBy: Robert JordanThis book is about three boys in which the world now depends on to survive. Rand al'Thor is the main character of this story. Mat and Perin are also important characters in the story. They are the three boys that the world depends on. They have an Aes Sedai and a Warder and two people that help them on their journey. Two of their friends and and a gleeman come with them also.This book had lots of strengths. It was very great in how it was written. It explained everything very good. It explained what everyone looked like and how everything happened. It painted a picture in my head. The whole book was very exciting. I don't think the book had any weaknesses in it. It was the one of the best book I ever read.If I were to compare this book to another book I would saw it is a lot like the Lord of the Rings series. It was almost as good as the Lord of the Rings because it had the heroes, the villains, and a lot of great characters.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the fantasy and war books. It is also the first book in the series.

The Eye of the WorldBy: Robert JordanThe main character of this book is Rand al Thor. He is a teenaged boy who lives in the Two Rivers. There are seven other characters but the story mainly revolves around him. In the book a girl Aes Sedai (sorceress) and a Warder (warrior) shows up in the Two Rivers. One night she gathers the three boys she was looking for. They leave hastily so they don't have time to prepare to leave. Their destined place is Tar Valon. But the trip there won't be easy when they are being hunted by the Dark One and other fiends. The Dark One will try to reach them in anyway that he can including in their dreams, darkfriends, and other aes sedai. But when they get split up at a fallen city two of the important boys no longer have the aes sedai to protect them. Will they survive and make it to Tar Valon? Will they find the others? Well go and buy or rent the book and find out! This book is defiantly one of the longer books. I would recommend this book to fantasy/war people. I did not think this book was short of anything. But I'll warn you now once you pick this book up you won't want to put it down.

To read at any time, but don't want one really long novel, then this is the book for you.I give Following Fake Man four stars for being a really good book, but more suspence would have made Following Fake Man a five star book in my opinion. Following Fake Man is about a boy named Homer Whinthrop who has to go live in Maine for a few weeks because his mother wanted a vacation and she chose her old home in Maine for the vaction. Whenever Homer wants to know about his father, his mother won't tell him and she has a unique way of not answering his questions.

I gave this book two stars because it was more bad then good. I mean the kids could have met a little differently. that's because who meets someone on vacation that they don't know and they just saw shoot a guy, and after he sees the one kid shoot the man he talks to him like they have been friends forever. Then they start hanging out every day.The only good part is the mystery behind the fake man and how it ends. It ends completely different then I thought it would. At first you'll think the old man is a kingpin drug dealer, but i guess you'll have to read it to find out how it ends.

This book is fantastic. I enjoyed this book so much.The thing that I enjoyed most about this book is that it's so easy to read. It does have three hundred and ninty nine pages in it, it is so easy. The chapters are about one to two pages long. This book gets off track sometimes, but then it picks up tremendously. There is a downside, I gave this book four stars instead of five because it has a bit more profanity that it should have. This book is about a murderer in America and a murderer in Europe and they both lead Alex Cross( a Washington D.C. police officer) and the rest of the bureu to a big case. Also another murderer is on the loose, Gary Soneji, who has vowed to kill Cross and his family. the two murders play a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Cross.

Rudy- A book about a young boy that lives in a coal minning neighborhood. His favorite football team is the Noter Dame Fighting Irish. He really would like to go and play football for the Irish but everyone says he can't. You only know how it will end up. If you have seen the movie &quot;Rudy&quot; you may think that you know what the book is about, but the book has many different qualities in it that the movie dosn't have in it. I would still recommend reading this book about a boy who kept getting put down that proved to everyone he could do it.

This story is about a boy named John, who does not really fit in until he has a date with the most popular girl in school. John&#65533;s father left him and his mother when he was young. Now John has a soon-to-be stepfather, which by the way beats him. John&#65533;s mother does not know about the beating of her only child. John goes on a date but the date turns out to be a run from fights and police. They manage to get out and go to Gloria&#65533;s, John&#65533;s date, house. They go down to Gloria&#65533;s basement and she tries to get him to get comfortable with him on the large couch. John does not feel comfortable remembering what her father has told him. John has to go through a tunnel just to survive. When he finally gets home, he goes through a lot more trouble. That is when John finds out that he is going to have an abusive father.There are many great parts in the book but there is also one thing that I did not like. I did not like how it was so confusing and it was hard to follow. The good parts are because it was suspenseful and it was great because it was as if I could see the whole story happen.

Where the Red Fern Grows is a very good book. A friend recomended it to me so I read it. It starts off with a man that sees something that reminds him of his past. And the book goes on telling his childhood story. It's a story about how the boy wants two little hound dogs and how he works to get them. The book tells how he trains his dogs to be very good hunters. He takes them on a lot of hunts. It also tells about the hunts that the boy and his dogs go on. I thought this was a very good book. I would recomend this book to anyone that likes hunting or dogs.

Midnight for Charlie Bone is about a boy who listens to photographs and is sent to a school full of kids that have talents just like him. Once Charlie is at school, he receives a mysterious box from a bookkeeper that has clues to someone else's past. Charlie spends his whole school year trying to figure out what the box really means.Some things I liked about the book was that it had a touch of fantasy about it. Some kids in the book had special powers. Some could fly or even hypnotize people. Another thing I liked about the book was that it was very suspenseful at the end. Charlie almost figures out what the box really means when something bad happens.Some of the things I did not like about the book is that it started out very slow. It wasn't until maybe the middle of the book that it started picking up. To tell the truth, I almost wanted to stop reading it because it wasn't very exciting in the beginning. The beginning actually sets the pace for the end. That is really the only thing I didn't like about the book.

Mattie has also been accepted to a writer's school in New York, but her neighbor wants her to stay so they can get married.

He blames himself over and over again and has to see a councilor for his problems. He's beginning to turn away from not only his friends and girl friend but his family also.Some things that I didn't like about the book was that it wasn't too suspenseful and I didn't like how the book was written. It basically all was about Andy going to the councilor and talking and nothing too big happened. What I did like about the book was that I could relate to the book in many ways. It was also very descriptive and was well understood.

The book Stuck in Neutral is about a boy named Shawn McDaniel who has cerebral palsy. He can't move at all, and he sits in a wheelchair all day. If that isn't bad enough, he thinks that his dad is trying to kill him. This book will keep you reading until the very last page. Some things I liked about the book that is was told in his perspective. I think that it is cool because I never thought about how kids with that disorder could be a normal kid with a normal mind. Another thing is that he tells the story like you are right there with him. Also, the book isn't depressing at all like you might think. Sometimes it's funny, too. The only part of the book that I didn't like was a part at the end. I don't think it was as good as it should have been. Because of this, I gave this book four starts.

This book is about an eight year old girl named Elsie Dinsmore. Her mom passed away right after she was born. Her dad couldn't handle the pain so he moved away. Horace (Elsie's father) left Elsie to be taken care of at his parent's home. There Elsie is faced with many problems. Elsie turns her problems to God and he helps her through them. All Elsie wants is for her dad to come home. She wonders, will he come home, will he love her? I love how in this book Elsie looks to god amongst all her problems, and how He always helps her through. This is the best book that I have ever read. There is not one single thing in this book that I didn't like. This book is the first of eight books in the Elsie Dinsmore Series, A Life of Faith. I plan to read the next seven of these books. This book reminds me a lot of the Bible. It is all about God and it tells true things about what God does for you. This is a great book for girls thirteen and older. But I bet boys could enjoy this book as well. This is the best book that I have ever read and I hope you get a chance to read it.

This book is about an eight year old girl named Elsie Dismore. It takes place in the mid-1800's on a plantation. Elsie lives with her grandpa and step grandma. She also lives with many of her aunt and uncles who are around her age. This book is about Elsie's Christian life and her struggles with her family. She has ups and downs, particularly with one character, her father. Elsie has a very hard life but continues to strengthen her relationship with Christ. She has to make many choices which could risk her life with God. I very much enjoyed this book. It was easy to relate to and it motivated me to have a relationship with God like Elsie. Even thought the young girl is only eight, she is very advanced in her faith. This book shows me hoe Elsie gets through her struggles. This is amazing to me because I have such a hard time and my struggles don't even compare to hers. This book also goes into great detail and puts you in Elsie's place. It keeps you guessing at how the different characters will react and keeps you turning the page. I would suggest this book to anyone who is having struggles believing in Christ. Elsie will encourage you to believe through her words and actions. This book was a true inspiration to me and helps me to grow strong in my faith. I hope that you chose this book to read so you can do the same!

This book is about a young girl named Elsie Dinsmore. If you like christian books, and books that go back in time; this book is for you. Elsie is a young girl, about 8 years old. She lives with her grandma, grandpa, aunts, and uncles. She lives with them because her mother dies when she was a little girl, and her father is away in Europe on business. Her grandparents think it was a mistake that she was even born, and neither of them trat her very well. Her aunts and uncles also arn't very nice to her. Read this book to find out how Elsie deal with all her troubles and how God has helped her through everything. This is the first book in the series. It was so good I can't wait to read the next.What i liked about this book: I am really into all the christian books, and this one really shows you how God can help you through anything and everything. This is one of those books that you just don't want to put down. I also like how it goes back in time. It doesn't happen n present day.There is nothing about this book that I didn't like. All round i though this was a really great book!

ELSIE'S ENDLESS WAIT is about a young girl of eight, by the name of Elsie, who has a tremendous Christain faith. Elsie's father has been in Europe since before she was born, and she dreams of meeting him and knowing the love of a parent. For Elsie's mother had died shortly after her birth so Elsie was put in care of her grandfather and step-grandmother. When Hoarce, her dad, comes home though, Elsie is devistated at his harshness toward her. The only thing that loves her is her servant, the woman who was her companion from day one of life.I loved this book because it is full of emotion as it tells the heartbreaking story of a girl's longing for love. Through all her troubles she turns to the Lord. Her understanding of the Holy Bible is beyond her years and absolutely nothing can shake her faith. Through that faith she is forgiven of her sins time and time again, and also forgives others in an attempt to be like Jesus. This book helped enrich my relationship with the Lord so much and challenges me to be more like Him.I have read a great number of books but have found none as enjoyable as this one. This is truly and amazing book and I would highly recommend it to any girl.

A man, Neely Crenshaw, comes back to his home town of Messina, who once was the powerhouse football team in the state. He comes back after fifteen years for the death and burial of his old and legendary coach, Eddie Rake. The thing is, he has to make a decision, does he love Coach Rake, or does he hate him. Since Coach Rake isn't around to talk, he has to make his decision based on his past experiences from when Neely was the star quarterback, and a few of those experiences are rather interesting. The book is full of stories from Neely's playing days.I really liked this book. It was full of action stories from the gridiron, some from Neely's days, some older, but all from the Rake Era. It is a great sports book, especially if you like football.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good sports book. If you like a book full of hard-hitting football stories, this is your book.

The book Monster is about Steve, a teenager who gets wrapped up in some bad stuff. I thought this book was very good. This book was good because it had actually taken place in a jail. I thoguht that was neat because I have never read a book like this before. This book also takes place in the point of view of a movie. This gives excellent visuals. Some bad things about MOnster are how the book is written. It makes you look weird because the words are spaced out and seems easy. This book also took along time to find out who was guilty ohe crime committed. I didn't like it because it held me up in suspence for too long. Some other good things about this book are, the way the main character, Steve, writes a journal and it is put in the book. The way the imates are discribed is also excellent. The front cover of the book is very interesting. The title Monster and the picture of Steve makes you wonder why it is called Monster. When the characters are in court it feels like you are in the room with them. The way the book uses its vocabulary is also nicley done. If I were to rate this book I would give it a four stars out of five. My reasons for this are all listed above. You should read this book if you like court,suspence, and actioned books. I haven't read any other books by this author,nor do I like to read but this book was thrilling.

I liked this book because the auother was talking in the same level as me. He explained everything. I did get confused when the judge would stay things that I didn't get very will. The auother told, wrote down in his eye view. He said what he thought about being in jail. He told the reader what he didn't do or did do about the accident. He gave the reader many different views of this problem. When he was in court or in jail he would write down who said what and who did what. Now after I read the book, I think that in the middle of the book they were taking it slow to get the end of the case. It is really interesting to now that not all blacks do bad things. When I would start reading I would get a lot read in so many minutes. The book was worte in a movie form. I think that this is a very good book. It just would take me time to read it because I have to read like I am in the book. I don't know, but I hope there is a second book coming out. I think that this topic that the main character had to go through was intersting. I enjoyed this book.

...I didn't really like this book. One of the main reasons was probably because it was like in a movie text. I didn't really understand it. Two main reasons that I started reading this book is because of the cover of the book and it had finger prints on it and that reminds me of criminals. I love reading books about criminals. And I guess u already know this is about criminals well sort of. Because Steve was getting some stuff in a food store and his friends said they would buy it for them so when they came out they said they paid for and they really didn't so he got put in jail for it. So he writes what happens in the form of a movie. So if you like criminal books, and like it in movie text, you will like this book.

By: Walter Dean Myers****I rate this book a **** star book because it gives you details but it lets you hanging until the end.This book is about a 22 year old boy named Steve Harmon. He was committed for robbing a gas station. He did this crime with two others. They were Richard Evans and James King. In this book you will find out what each person will do to complete this crime. You will also see what James King did and why he is not just a robber.Some strength in this book is when they tell you what he does during court and also in his cell. There are also some weaknesses in this book one I would say is when the judge talks to people in the stands. They would sit there and talk to each other about something that does have anything to do if the court. It is better when they ask questions.I would recommend this book to anybody that would like to hold off to the end to find out what happened. I would also recommend this book to people that are kind of into robbing and then getting caught for doing the crime. For the people that would like to no what court and jail id like.

Big Mouth And Ugly Girl was a book about a popular boy,Matt Dounagy and a geeky girl, Ursula Riggs. The boy was funny and loud and the girl was a fierce, loner. The boy gets into some trouble and the girl sticks up for him. They ended up becoming good friends and doing alot together. The reason I liked this book so much is because the characters were around my age, which is 13. I also liked this book because of the fact that a popular boy became freinds with a geeky girl.This was a very good book and I encourage you to read it

Hi, I read the book "Big Mouth and Ugly Girl". This book was pretty good, but it didn't have loads of excitement in it. This is not a book that would keep you excited throughout the whole story, but it's not so boring that you won't want to finish it.In this book the main character Matt Donaghy is supposely accused for something that he said, but he apparenly never said it. No one in the school knows if his side of the story is true or if he really did say something worth being accused for.Matt loses a lot when no one believes him, but he starts to think that he's gained more than he ever lost.This book takes Matt through thick and thin and back to thick again leading him on an outrageous high school journey.I liked this book pretty well and I think if you will read it you will like it too!

The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a great book about a mother and daughter who fight over everything. Vivi, the mother, and her girlfriends, the Ya-Ya's, do everything together and they have all their lives. But the Ya-Ya's had many problems growing up and raising their children. Sidda is Vivi's daughter, they love each othervery much, but they fight over little things and some very big things.Throughout the book you learn about Vivi's life and her view on things and about Sidda's life and her view of things through flashbacks and them telling about things that go on. Sidda tells of the problems her mother had raising the children and of her mother's drinking and chain smoking problems. Also how Vivi was in and out of her life. She tells of the times her mother would beat her and her siblings. Vivi also tells her side of the story.I really enjoyed this book. It was better then the movie that has been made for the it. The book goes much more into detail about the characters lives and problems. The Divine Secrets (...) also goes into more detail about what is going on.The only problem I had with The Divine Secrets (...) was that Vivi and the other three Ya-Ya's use strong language...a lot! Also that Vivi and Sidda would talk every other chapter. For example; the first chapter Sidda talks and the second chapter Vivi talks...and that's how the story is told. That was the only confusing thing to me.I would recommend this book to older readers because of the strong language.But this is a great book about love, betrayal, and memories. And I enjoyed it greatly.Happy Reading!

A boy named Tom lives with his dad. A near by school has a shooting, kind of like Columbine. Everyone is very worried about it because it happened only 50 miles away. Could it happen at Central (toms school)? This is exactly what his school doesn't want to happen, so they hire a guidance counselor named Mr. Wilner. This seems like no big deal until he starts making strict rules all the students need to follow. There are now metal detectors and safety guards. Things, in the students eyes, seem to be getting out of hand. And the parents? They are getting e-mails from the school which are somehow brainwashing them. Worst of all, anyone who disobeys these ridiculous rules will be sent to a camp. 3 kids have already been sent, 2 of them are Tom's friends. Will he be next?I think the book had a great theme. Although the beginning was very slow. It's a long read for when you can't think of something to do.

The book Bloody Jack is about a homeless girl. First of all her family dies in what she calls the dark day. A gang comes and steels all of her clothes, and then she goes with them. The leader of the gang dies about five years later. She can't handle it so she goes to the docks. She has always wanted to be a sailor. She tells the captain that she can read and she is enrolled as a ships boy. The only problem is that no one can find out that she is a girl otherwise she will be hanged. The other boys start to wonder why she doesn't stick around when they take a swim. Finally she tells one boy that she is a girl. He is astonished. Then they fall in love. I didn't like this book very much because there was not very much action. I guess it was sort of a girl's book. I picked it out because the title sounded pretty good. Then I read the summary and it talked about pirates and blood. But they only come upon a couple of pirate ships. Everything else is she is just worried about if she will get caught. I will not tell you what happens next. You have to read. I guess that is why they say never judge a book by its cover.

Face is about a fifteen year old boy who is popular and the head of his group of friends, Mike and Mattew and he has a girlfriend, Natalie. Martin had a great life until he was convinced to get into a stolen car. The car crashed and Martin was taken to the hospital. His life became much different after that night. The rest of the book tells his good and bad experiences and some things that he lost since his face bacame burnt in the crash.What I liked about this book was that Martin was able to find his inner self and he knew he didn't have to have everything to make him happy.What I disliked was how his best friends,girlfriend, and parents acted around him since his face was deformed. It was as though they viewed him as a completely different person, although his face was the only thing that was different.

The book is about this man that lives in France. He finds himself living in the United States again renting a house from a nice old lady. Part of the story is about the previouse owner of the house and how she survived in the time that she grew up. While you learn about that person and her story the man from the story has a romance going on too. The book switches back from one story to another.I would recommend this book for someone that has a good imagination and can handle two story lines at once. Some of the book seems boring but in the end the book is worth it. The author of the book describes the characters in a way so that you can visualize them clearly in your head and you feel like you're there with them, going through what they are, and experiancing the same feelings they are.

Wanted! was both thrilling and suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Once you pick it up you won't want to put it back down. Wanted! is about Alice who is normal 15-year-old girl until one very fateful day. Alice's dad called her frantically and asked her to drive his prized corvette and meet him at their favorite ice-cream place and bring the two disks labeled twin with her. He didn't even care that she didn't have her license yet. Alice thought it was strange, but she followed her father's instructions anyways. Before she could leave she heard an intruder and had to hide until he left. Alice left as quickly as she could after the intruder left and finally made it to the ice-cream place. When her father didn't call or meet her there she became worried. To calm her nerves Alice flipped on the radio and heard an announcement that her father was murdered and she was the lead suspect. They even said that they had an E-mail confession from Alice. Suddenly Alice wasn't normal anymore. She was a fugitive, and she had to find the real murderer before she was caught by the police. Or even worse the murderer. This was an excellent murder mystery that left me wanting to read more. It had an excellent plot and good descriptions. Caroline B. Coonie is an excellent writer. I think that this is her best book, and it is my favorite book of all. She described Alice's reactions so well it seemed real. I strongly recommend that you read this book, especially if you enjoy murder mysteries.

If you like mystery and suspence you should read the book called A Candidate for Murder by Joan Lowery Nixon. It is about a young 16 year old girl, Cary Amberson, who's father is running for governor of Texas. So, after she recieved some rather scary phone calls from a stranger she never heard of , the police say it is just from all the publicity their family is getting. She knows it is something more dangerous than just some prank phone calls, so she tries to figure out the whole story about the strange things that have been going on.I think this was a really good book because you really didn't know what was going to happen next. There were a lot of twists and turns in the book, and I could really relate to the main character. She did most of the stuff that I would have done. But, some parts were kind of hard to understand, so you had to read it carefully. Read this book and see how Cary deals with her father running for governor, and the almost freaky phone calls she starts to get.

The book is told by a Senior in highschool named Travis Cody. He lives in a small town that loves football. The small town is Oil Camp in Louisana. The whole book takes place in one day and their are alot of memories too. It is all about the State Championship with the Oil Camp Roughnecks and the Pineview Pelicans.I hate the book because at first I couldn't tell when the story was taking place because of the memories. I hated how it ended. Ti was all leading up to the big game, but when they got to it, the book ended. During the second play the game ended, what's up with that! I wanted to know who won the game, but it never came. Not even the final score. I also hated it because it had no action. The most action was when Travis forearmed someone in the book. To make the book better, all they had to do was to have the football game in the book. I did not even get the plot of the book. I do not even think their was a plot.That is what I think of the book called Roughnecks. That is why I gave it two stars.

This book was about a foreign Asian family that lived in L.A. They had a grocery store and people really liked them. Then their uncle asked the family if he could borrow a bunch of money to start a business up in Minnesota. The narrorator is a teenage boy named Chan. His twin sister's name is Young, and their last name is Kim. Their uncle, after starting his business and just leaves. He thought that he would make a bunch of money by working with robots. So the Kim's had to move up to Minnesota and run that business. When they get there they sign up for a school. Then Chan plays football for them. After a while, he was being made fun of and picked on because he was the only Asian kid on the team.A thing that I did like about this book is that there is football in it. Anther thing I liked about this book is that it shows the struggle of a geeky foreign kid getting pushed around.Things I didn't like about this was that they had some Asian words in it. I can't read that so that was bad. Another thing that I didn't like was that everything moved so fast. Like one day they are in L.A. and like two pages later their in Minnesota.

****The Brethren is an exiting book that focuses on three judges that have been sentenced to a low security prison. They figure out a way to become very rich by black mailing rich people who have something big to hide. But when they start to mess with the future president of the United States things start to get very messy for the three judges.I thing the major story in the book in the plot as the same with most of his other books. The way it was written it make you want to turn the next page because you can get so involved in the characters and their story.The only problems I have found about the book was that with going back and for the between the two stories it was sometimes hard to follow. I also think he did not focus on each set of characters as much as he should.I would recommend this book to anyone who has liked any of his past books and to anyone who is not afraid of his style of writing.In my view this is still a very good book despite the ending. I would definetly read this book again.

Hi, I read the book called The Long Rain. This was a O.K. book. I honestly didn't like the book in the beginning. I didn't like it because the main character tried to hide the fact that he had taken a life of a young boy. He did this to try to protect a vineyard behind his house in the wine region state of California. He also tried to hide it because of his wife and child. I think that he should have just told the truth in the first place because he ended up trying to defend the man that the police had brought in for questioning. He was the only one that knows the truth about what actually happenend. To find out other things that happened, read this book.

I read Rough Waters; it is an ok book, but not the best that I have read. I would highly recommend this book to any one that enjoys adventure. The book starts out with the main characters, Scott and his older brother Gregg; have to move to Colorado to live with an uncle they never new they had. Their uncle owns his own rafting company on the Arkansas River. At first life is a little rough because they are still trying to get over their parents death. As it goes most things get better in life, this story gets better for the most part. Scott is left out by his brother because he is a lot younger than Gregg. One day during the summer Scott goes exploring in the back yard. He finds an old bike in a shed. Scott decides to go into town on the rickety old bike. In town he goes to the library because he is kind of a bookworm. At the library he meets a girl!! That is all I'm going to tell you about the book. If it sounds interesting to you, read it. I liked it; it takes a really good book to do that because I don't ever read. This is a really good book, ~ENJOY~!!!!!!!!

The book The Lost Boy is a sequal to A Child Called it. It tells the adventures a child named Dave goes through. As a child he was brutally abused by his alcoholic mother. It also tells about his trial at court against his mother and all the foster homes he has to live in. After the trial he goes to his new foster home. This story is a true story. The book's main character is also the author. I reccomend the book The Lost Boy because I thought it was very interesting to see what was going to happen next.

The book Shattering Glass is a very good book. The book is about a kid named Simon Glass who is in school that is kind of a nerd. He meets a group of friends and they act like they are going to be his friends. After a while they start to make him do things that he doesn't want to do to stay in the group of friends.Some of the strengths of this book are that it was really good. The reason it was so good is because as soon as you start to read the book you can't let it down because you always want to now what happens next. If you ask me I do not think there are any weaknesses in this book.The book Shattering Glass is probably the best book that I have ever read. There might be a couple of books that are better, but this one is really good.I highly recommend for everyone to read this. If you don't read this book you have no idea what you are missing because this book is so good.

The City of Ember is about two teenage kids. They are trying to find a way out of the town they live in because after the town's lights, there is complete darkness. They both have jobs for the town. Doon works in the pipe works where the river runs the generator which creates electric for the town. Lina is a messenger. She takes messages from person to person. They want to find there way out of the town becuase the generator is breaking down and no one wants to be stuck in complete darkness. Join Doon and Lina on this action packed adventure.I liked this book very much. It was action packed and kept me wanting to read. The middle was the very best part of the book. This was when they were searching for the way out of Ember.What I didn't like about the book was the ending and also it took awhile for the book to get into the flow of things at the beginnig.

This book, Keep the Fiath, is a relly good book. It will start with someone and stop, then start again with someone else. You don't stop thinking about the other person.It draws you into the book. I would recomend rerading this book. I started with book four and read five and six also. The book is about young people who have problems like we have today. Other books like this are Lurlene McDaniel books. Her books deal with people and things today. Keep the Faith, is a book that i would rate a five being the highest. the author did a great job of writing the book. I would recomend it to anyone who liked books of romance and of things that we deal with today. this is a really great book to read.

Interstellar Pig isn't the greatest book that I have read. It seemed really unreal with a lot of the stuff that was in the book. I know fictional books aren't supposed to be real, but I think Wiilliam Sleator really strecthed the meaning of fictional. I mean, it seemed as everything was made up right off hand and I didn't really think the book flowed very well. For example, at the beginning of the book it talked about this really historical house that the new neighbors that moved in next to it were really interested in the house. They always were over there, rooting through stuff in the house. I thought it was going to be a good mystery story about the hosue, and it turned out that they never talked about the book again in the story. After a few mind-teasing sentences, the book totally switched topics and started talking about some darn board game. So unless you enjoy wasting your time reading pointless books, I recommend that you don't read Interstellar Pig.

This book was evry interesting because it helps people understand how it feels to go to a new school, move to a new town, and a new house, and try to fin some new friends. Lani had just gotten over cancer. So when she chemo, she had lost all of her hair.When it all grew back Lani didn't cut it.When Lani trys to find friends people don't know if Lani was a girl or a boy? So everyone kind of left Lani alown because guys didn't want to become friends if Lani was a girl, and if the popular girls would go over to become friends with Lani, what is Lani was a guy they wouldn't know.So things that I didn't like about the book was that they kept on draging the story on and on until Lani would find a friend or someone to even atempt to go and talk to Lani.Over all I liked the book that is why I gave the book ****. The book kind of kept my interest at the end of the book, because you found out who Lani Garver really was.

Son of The MobThe Son of The Mob is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone. It&#65533;s about a kid named Vince and his whole family is part of a mafia. That includes his father, his mother, his brother, and all of his uncles. Vince on the other hand, doesn&#65533;t want to have any thing to do with the business. Vince has a best friend named Alex. Alex and Vince try to impress the girls at their school by doing weird things. Vince usually can get a girlfriend but his brother always messes it up for him. For instance, when he went on his first date, he took a girl to the beach for a pickneck. Turns out that his brother tied a guy up and threw him in the back of Vince&#65533;s car with the pickneck blanket. When Vince joins the football team, he finds out that he&#65533;s very good because the other team knows about his dads business. They don&#65533;t want to hurt Vince because they are afraid of what Vince&#65533;s dad might do to them if they do hurt Vince. Vince quits the football team when he finds out. Then he meets a girl named Kendra that works for the school newspaper. Vince and Kendra meet together a couple of times throughout the book. I rate this book at a **** star rating.By Gordon Korman

Even when he was trying to play football his dad's life got in the way because of a boy with big mouth. Weeks later Vince meets the love of his life named Kendra at a party that him and Alex went to together. While at the party Vince and Kendra end up making out. Vince finds out something about Kendra's father what he wishes he didn't know. Vince's life gets very complexed when his life and the vending machine crash into each other. The next thing Vince knows is that he is learning about his brother, his dad and even his mom.This books had many strengths such as good detail, you feel like you are in the book. It also does a good job describing things so you know what's going on and it looks like. In my eyes this book has know weaknesses.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fiction.

This book is about two girls, Melly and Anny Beth, who take a shot called PT-1 to make them deage. This book just follows them around and explains what it would be like to "live twice". I gave this book two stars because of how confusing and complicated it was to read. The Chapters are set up to rotate from 2001 to 2085 every other chapter. I also didn't like the end of the book, because there wasn't one. The story just stops and your looking for another page. I did enjoy so of this book, like sometimes they would leave you hanging and you can't put it down. This book would be good for people who like strange fanticy books. I really didn't care for this book but others really did.

Turn about is a great book about 2 old ladies taking this medicine and making them age younger instead of older. Then the book goes on to tell the dificulties that they go through aging younger like trying to find someone to take care of them when they age back to being infants again. To tell you the truth, I really liked every part of the book like how they go from present time to when they are old, to the future when they are already aged younger. I recommended this book to anyone who is looking for a good, exciting story to read.

I liked this book, "What Janie Found", and I didn't like it.I didn't like it because It started out slow. The book didn't describe the things that were needed to be described. The things that were described usually were the small things of the story. The things I liked about this book are that when it described things, it described them good. The aurthor sticks to the things that happened in her past a lot. I wold recomend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. The main character in my book goesthrough some hard times in her life but, she gets through them. For example,she gets kidnapped and bairly ever sees her real family. It seems very hard for her to go through all of that. I still like this book though even if it has a little mix up of the describing. I have read the whole set of the books. They really intrest me a lotso take the chance and read them, you'll like them!

The book Joey Pigza Loses control is a very weird book. It was about a kid who wants to go and meet his Dad. His dad ran away when he was very little. Finally his dream comes true. Joey takes medicine to make him less hyper. His dad takes his medication from him. So this is making him mad and hyper. Then Joey gets to be on his dad's baseball team. Joey's dad is trying to turn Joey's life around. You will enjoy this funny and short book. If you like baseball, dogs, bungee jumping then you will like this book. You will have fun reading this book because I did.

This book was about a girl that went to a party and something happend then after that no one liked her at school. She never fit in the groups or anything. What I liked about this book was it talked about this girl and her hole life story. Like she never fit in at school or she never had friends. Everything she did there would be a problem behind it. What I didn't like about the book is it dragged on I mean it would be on the same topic for the longest time. Ohther than that I really liked it.

With no friends, Melinda Sordino, enters high school as a tattle-tale who's in no social group. No one gives her the time of day, after she ratted out a party that had beer at it during the summer. Finding comfort in a janitor's closet is where she keeps in a secret that is eating her alive. She ignores her family and skips classes to avoid students. Will she find friends? Will she break down and tell her secret? You'll just have to read and find out!!!I really enjoyed this great novel written by Laurie Halse Anderson. The plot was carefully planned out, and the main character is very hard to understand, which keeps you guessing. This book would be greatly enjoyed by young teenage girls.There was nothing about this book that I didn't like. Every part of this story kept me guessing on what would happen next. Anyone who enjoys books that have a little suspense and humor would surely enjoy this well written novel. So stop by your library and check out this great book.

I read the book Speak. One of my friends had recomended it to me and we both like the same types of books.Speak is about a teenage girl who goes to a party with her friend and something horrible happens. She calls the police then gets too scared and runs home.Everyone in her school knows who called the cops and the girl is outcasted. She has no one to talk to about why she called the police not even her ex-friends. She does not know how to get what happened out of her head.With all the different things this girl goes through, this book will have you guessing till the very last page.I really enjoyed Speak and i give it five stars out of five. It really was an excellent book.

They loose there tour guide ad are floating down the Colorado River, through the Grand Canyon. They run into problems like on Kings Peak where it is almost a disaster and they almost lose a member of the group. This is an exciting book with action for everyone.This book I really liked it wasn&#65533;t my favorite but it had to be up there. I gave it a 4out of 5 star rating. I chose this because it was like a Gary Paulson book who is my favorite author because of hatchet. That is the book I would compare it to this book.I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a great book to read for everyone and it&#65533;s a middle size book. I thought this was a great book and other people should read it.

I would recommend this book to likes sports and a little bit of comedy.

This is a book about a young girl Wizard that is trying to save her mothers life. But to save her mothers life she must risk her wizardry and possibly her life trusting the one person she has been fighting against. It was interesting throughout the entire story. It is an emotional story that deals with the losing of family members.I thought the end of the book just kind of abruptly stopped. I did not think that this book was like any other books.

High Heat is a book a teenage boy who has many problems that he needs to overcome in his life. He does his best to overcome his family troubles by playing baseball, which he loves and is very good at. While doing this he runs into more problems by playing baseball, but he doesn't quit. This is a great book when you think about doing what you love and not quiting. It was an inspirational book to me and it probably to many others.What I liked about this book was that it expresses Shane Hunter's(the main character) feelings so that you feel that you are right there doing what Shane is doing. It also has many great baseball scenes, for a person that likes to play baseball you can relate to. It has him suffering and it has him starring. The book is a great balance of good and bad.What I didnt like about this book is that it dragged some of the scenes out too much. Some of the least important scenes had too much information to them.

A Different Season by David Klass is a great book about a boy who is named Jim. He is a phenomenon pitcher for Oakdale High and the scouts are crazy about him. His dad, Bill, is a former New York Yankee who suddenly had to quit baseball and is now a lawyer. Jim doesn't even know what happened to his father. The school year becomes sour when a girl at school that Jims likes tries to join the prestigious high school baseball team because the softball team is a bunch of losers with second hand equipment, Jim and the men of the town are outraged. But Jennifer is determined to play with the boys. When the School Board decides that she is allowed to play baseball, the season seems like a black hole. At the first scrimmage a news camera appears and baseball just doesn't seem the same. Then a new face rises from within and now two people have stolen the light from Jim. Joshua Bishop, a pitcher, and power hitter from rival, Hillcrest, and Jennifer are now the talk of the state. Jennifer is a second string second baseman and former sprinter, but the question still lingers. Can she steal home?If you like a good book about sports, women's rights, and love, you should definitely read this book. A story about a teenager dealing with the problems of his friends and life is a great plot and I guarantee that you will not be able to put this book down.

The book deserved 2 stars because it was a terrible book. I really didn't care for it. it is basically a bunch of short stories about people on how they don't fit in. Alot of it was untrue because people only act bad when they are not liked by others. I also think it deserved 2 stars because it had a bunhc of short stories and there is no boring parts in it. If it would of been a long book i dont think to many peple would be interested in it. Over all i think if somone get's the book they should through it away.

I thought the book was a bunch of bolagna. I didnt care for it at all and someone should burn it. The only reason i liked it was because it had a bunch of short stories and not just one big book with a bunch of chapters. It had a lot of truth in it which is the only good part of the book. The book was basically about kids that dont fit in and are outsiders. Who ever get's this bpok should throw it away or tearit and burn it into peices.

If you would like to read a fantastic book read "Life at Theses Speeds." It's about an average teenage boy named Kevin Schuler who became a famous track and cross country runner. He becomes a phenomenal runner when his friends and girlfriend gets killed in a bus accident on the way home from a track meet. He was the only one who survived so he has the challenge of moving on and putting his past and fears behind him. I thought this book was the best book I have ever read. I like the way it was written. The flashbacks to before the bus accident with his girlfriend and friends really helped show me the relationship Kevin Schuler had with each one of them. The book also proves to people that your dreams and goals do come true if you want them bad enough. If you like books about running I would highly recommend this book. I like to run so this book was very enjoyable for me and if you read it I hope you enjoy it too.

This book is about a boy who had a sister that died from her boyfriend. He can't forget about his sister and how she died. Her boyfriend stabbed her fifty seven times, and Leo keeps seeing the pictures of his sister when she is dead. This book is also about a girl named Bree who is tired of her perfect boyfriend, her perfect mother, and her perfect life. So one night she goes out on a ride to get away from everything and gets kidnapped by a guy that says she should have died, and not his sister Michelle. It ends up being Leo getting `revenge', even though Bree has nothing to do with the murder of his sister.I liked the whole story, but not at the end because it leaves you hanging, and there are two narrators which are Leo, and Bree and sometimes it gets confusing.I would recommend this book to teenagers (mostly girls) who are into mystery books.

Dead Girls Don't Write Letters is about a teenager named Jazz, which goes missing. Sunny, her sister, is glad that Jazz isn't around anymore. Lets just put it this way; Jazz wasn't too nice to Sunny. Plus, when Jazz was around they acted as if Sunny didn't even exist pretty much. Their mother at this time is in a depression thinking that Jazz has died in a fire that happened in New York City. Out of no where, Sunny gets this letter that was written with yellow stationary paper, and Jazzes handwriting. She didn't want to open it right away, because she figured it could wait. Finally, when she opens it, it says that she's going to be coming home in a week or so. Sure enough, a week later Jazz shows up. The thing is, this girl doesn't act, or even look like Jazz. Sunny thinks that she looks too pretty to be Jazz. Their father doesn't think that it's Jazz either. Both of them don't want to tell her mother yet, because with Jazz coming home and all is calming her down a bit and they don't want to ruin it. What do Jazz and her father do? What do Jazz and her father do? Also, is it really Jazz?

Chasing Redbird was a great book. It was one of those books that you have to keep reading because it keeps getting better and you can't put it down. Chasing Redbird is about a 13 year old girl named Zinny. Zinny is from a big family where everyone always mixes her and her sisters up. She is tired of being mixed up with them all the time. During the summer she finds a trail covered up and she plans to uncover it. She wants to be known for something and for everyone to know who she is. She finds out stuff about her family that she never knew about them. Also a guy that likes her so much that he would do anything for her, even if it means getting in trouble with the law. This was a very good book and I think that you should read it.

This book is about Heaven, a pretty, young girl, and her family, just trying to survive. They must deal with low food supply (when they have some), Our Jane's bad health, and their wicked father, who is hardly ever home--a dirty little shack in the Willies. All Heaven, and her five siblings, want is to run away to a good life. Their father has other plans for them.I would recommend this book to everyone who can read. It was definitely the most moving book I've ever read.

I gave &quot;A Place Apart&quot; by Paula Fox three stars, because it was a good book, but it did not wow me. I like books that are full of suspence or that have a unpredictable ending. This book was mostly about a girl and the troubles that she has to deal with in life. The book would be interesting to people who want to know about other kind of lifestyles in life. Some people are wealthy and life comes easy to them, but for Tori her life is rough and confusing. The book is about a girl and her life, having her father just died, her mother and her smoking problems, and her relationship with Hugh, a guy she knows. So in conclusion I think you should give this book a chance.

Elsie's Great Hope is a book about a girl who is going to live with her cousin after she has fallen down the stairs. Following the incident of tumbling down the stairs, she is disabled and will never walk anymore. Her mother is currently in a coma from being through out of the wagon. Her mother's memory was damaged and thinks she's a child. It's a struggle for Elsie's cousin to fit in right after Elsie's daughter died. Elsie's cousin feels like she is getting in the way, and she doesn't see the purpose of living anymore. Elsie's other daughter is being chased around by boys wanting to marry her. She has to choose between one man that will be able to support her with all the finest things, while the other gentleman can barely support himself.The book kept me interested in what was going to happen next, but also gave me hints to what might go on. It was easy to read and follow along, besides the parts that Elsie's cousin was talking through her journal and the narrator was talking. This book is apart of a series of eight books; this book is the last of the series. I recommend this book to teenage Christian girls. Throughout this book there was bible verses that relate to things in life.

Both Sides of Time is a pretty good book. It is about a fifteen-year-old girl named Annie who travels back in time--one hundred years to be exact! This book tells about Annie's romance in the present, and "back in time".I liked and disliked this book for many reasons. I liked this book because it has a good story line. I could relate to Annie in many ways, too. One thing I could relate to her with is when she had to choose which side she wanted to be on-the present or stay back in time. I have had to choose sides just like she did and I hated making someone sad or upset just like she did.I disliked the book also. One reason was because the text went back and forth between scenes and it was confusing. The narrator starts talking and you figure out that it is a different scene and different people are talking. Another reason I didn't like this book is because there were so many characters and the book tells you who they are once, but after that you have to remember who they are, and if you don't, you have to look it back up in the book.I would give this book a four star because it was good, but it wasn't the greatest book I have read. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mystery, drama, and romance.

It was about a 18-year old boy named Austin Reid that was the star of the football team. He loves this girl named Heather who is supposedly the best looking girl in Texas to the boys at her school and her and Austin hook up. At the beginning they had a very good relationship. Then something happened to the relationship that will change their own future.The part I liked was the way he was a good football player, had friends, and kind of related to real life. I also like how sometimes him and Heather really liked each other and in other times they hated each other. I liked that it wasn't a love story like it sounded. The thing I didn't like about it was how they went from not even knowing eachother to making out. I think it would have been a better book if they would have built up to their relationship.That was about the only thing I didn't like. Other than that it was a great book and I didn't want to put it down.

Cirque Du Freak is about two young teenagers and a man. Their names are Darren, Steve, and Mr. Crepsley. Darren and Steve receive tickets to this weird freak show and they end up going to it, even though they are not aloud to. They meet Mr. Crepsley and one of the boys goes to a world of vampires in order to save his friend. I can't tell you who.I like how this book makes you want to know what's going to happen next. You don't want to put the book down and stop reading it. It's that good. It's totally unreal, but it seems real because of how the author writes it. I liked this whole entire book. I didn't hate one part of it.This novel is part of a series and its book number one. If you do start the series, you have to read this one first. This is actually the first vampire book I read and I loved it. If you don't like fiction, I definitely wouldn't recommend this book. If you love reading books about scary stuff, this is the book for you. You can't put it down.

I read Cirque Du Freak: A Living Nightmare, written by Darren Shan. The main character is a young boy named Darren Shan. He and his best friend get their hands on two tickets to see a secret freak show. They, and the rest of the audience, are amazed at what they see. Darren loves spiders, and would do anything to get the giant tarantula, Madam Octa, who is in the show. Unfortunatly, the man who owns her is a vampire, as Darren finds out in a weird turn of events. He steals the spider at night, and takes it in his room to play with it. His best friend gets bitten, and you won't believe what Darren has to do to heal him.I really liked this book. It was easy to follow along, and it was very suspensful. The one thing I didn't like is that it didn't last long enough. I have not read another book in its class.

The book "Walk to Remember" was a great book. There was alot on emotional and funny parts in this book. The setting was really confusing in the beginning because the main character Landon was forty years old and he was telling a story about his life when he was a senoir in high school. He was telling about how he and this girl first met in drama class and in and out of school activitys. These two restless young adults had alot in common , but they never found out until the first started talking to each other when Landon needed a date for homecoming. Landon tired asking his ex girlfriend, but she didnt want anythign to do with him. So Landon spent one whole night looking in the year book, and the next day at school he asked Jamie she wasnt so popular but Landon was despert to find someone to go with he didnt wanna serve people punch all night. Now one thing about homecoming was Landon had to meet Jamies father the precher of there church. After the dance they were in a drama play together.. And if u really like romantic books this is the one u should read because there are more thigns that happen but you have to read to find out.......... " promise u cant fall in love with me"

I liked when Landon and Jamie became friends. But when he acted like he wasn't friends with her around his own frinds, I thought that was rude. Landon has a life full of problems, but he learns to get pass them, which is is good. Jamie is a nice girl throughtout the whole book. She helps others and gives to charity. At Christmas time Landon does a really nice thing for the kids at the orphange. At the end of the book it becomes sad. Overall, this was a very good book. By far, the best I have ever read.

I give this book 5 stars because I thought it was really good. It is deffently a book you can't put down or even stop wanting to feel tears in your eyes.This book is about a teenage girl named Jamie Silivan in her senior year at high school. Jamie is a very freindly girl and loves spending time with the orphans. She carries a bible around with her every where she goes. People make fun of Jamie behind her back. Then there's a teenage boy named Landon who is a popular one at school and also makes fun of Jamie. Well They both are in a play together. Landon Dosen't want to be in this play but Jamie helps with his lines. Landon falls i n love with her but then there's something else that falls right between their love.I would deffentily recomend this book to any girl and not so much a boy because its more of a love story than an action kind of book. It was really good. This book was wrote by Nicholas Sparks. Very good auotor. All of his books were awsome.

The book,The Rescue, by Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite books. The Rescue focuses on a tragedy turned romance. This book is unlike any other Nicholas Sparks book. The Rescue is about a woman who has a terrible accident and the story goes on telling the tale as the woman and her young son watch their life unravel. The Rscue follows the young mother through the hurdles she had to jump and the mazes that she had to go through to get through her lfe and pay the bills. The single mother shares her stuggles with her slightly disabled son. If you have read any of the other Nicholas Sparks books, you'll love the romantic elements in this book.

Bambi was about a young prince named Bambi,a deer, and his life avoiding man. Bambi is a delicious book. A true classic. Generation after generation will certainly love it like I did. You won't be able to put it down. I liked the book because, I enjoy hunting, so it was kinda cool to read about animals. The reason i gave it four stars was because I disliked the book a little. I disliked the book because it wasn't like the movie, and it made my fellow hunters look bad.

The book, A Diffrent Season, is a really exciting book with a good balance of love and baseball. It is about a girl who wants to play baseball, and how the baseball star and a girl that wants to join the team start a relation ship. It is also about how they get through the season with all of the changes of a girl playing on a boy's baseball team. As you can imagine thier are many diffrent conflicts that go along with a girl playing on the boys team. Also her new, friend the star pitcher of the team, is against her playing on the boys team. He also doesn't think that a girl can make it in boy's baseball. Read this book and find out how they overcome their diffrences and become lovers. This is a good book and I really advise you to read it if you enjoy a compelling romantic baseball story. I give it two thumbs up.

I give this book 4 stars because it was a really good book, but it needed a few things that could have made it better. Stargirl is a book about a girl who moves into a new school, but doesn't fit in with anyone. She is the friendliest person you would ever meet yet no one liked her. I liked this book because it has a lot to do with teen life and how we are always trying to fit in with the "popular" people. I could kinda relate to the book which made it more interesting to read. It also made me feel like I was more into the book. I didn't like the ending of the book though. I think it could have been better. In a way the ending also had a connection of teen lifes, but I didn't like it. For the most part, Stargirl was a very exciting and interesting book.

Stargirl is an interesting book about ever teen life. Stargirl is a girl who moves to Seneca High. Everyone clicks-except her. People hate her individuality. They just can't accept the different things about her. And influenced by a frined, she'd loose all identiy of herself to become popular.I like this story because it's real with things that teens have to deal with like peer pressure. I also had a really good message: Don't be afraid of yourself. This book reallt exposes that. Sometimes, the book is confusing, like the whole desert scene, but other than that it is a really good book.

I really liked the book Cut,. The book Cut would sometimes you would just on the edge of your. I liked how you wouldn't know what would happen next. It is about a young teenage girl who got caught in her whole life and couldn't take it no more and she tried to kill herself. She was sent to mental institution were there she would have to face people with what she did. What I dislike about the book was when you thought she was going to talk, she did'n. I say a movie ones about a girl that had to go to a mental institution, but I haven't read a book like Cut.

Cut is a great book about Callie, a 15 year old girl who isn't talking to anybody. Not even her therapist at Sea Pines, which is a "residential treatment facility" where her parents sent her after discovering that she mysteriously cuts herself. Callie eventually finds her voice and confides in her therapist.She also starts talking to the other girls at Sea Pines who have issues of their own such as anorexia, bulimia, eating too much, and also cutting theirselves like Callie. As her treatment with her therapist progresses, the story to why she cuts herself starts starts to unfold. What happens next? I don't know. You'll have to read the read the book to find out.The reason I like this book is because it keeps you wanting to read more. In the beginning it's not the best and kind of hard to understand, but once you get further into the book you never want to put it down. Each page you turn just keeps getting more exciting than the previous page. I hope you take the time to enjoy this book as much as I have.

If you like vampire books, this is a very good book. It's about a kid, named Cody Elliot, who moves from California and hates his new town. So, he thinks, if he does badly in school, that his parents might move back to California. He starts to flunk school, and do a lot of things like try and prove Newton was wrong by trying to fly during class. His mom and dad just pull him out of school and put him in a school called Vlad Dracul. The one thing Cody doesn't no, is the school is for vampires. Cody befriends two vampires. Well, I don't want to spoil the book for you, so read the book.

Bloody Sundays is Just a book manly about a bunch of NFL football stories. It also talks about a bunch of good football players and how they got into the football business. Some of the reasons I liked this book is because it has a big chapter about one of the best halfbacks Emitte Smith, and the reason I liked that part of the book is because I really like Emitte Smith there for I liked reading and leaning about him. But with all the good things they were a couple things that I did not like. Some of the things I did not like are it left out a lot of the great football legends Like OJ Simpson, Joe Namath, Bart Star and, Barry Sanders. The reason that made me not like it is because they are football players I really liked and wanted to learn about so that made me made. That is my likes and dislikes of the book.

THE ADVENTURES OF THE BLUE AVENGER is a book about a sixteen year old boy becoming the Blue Avenger. I gave my story three stars out of five, because I don't really like the idea of becoming a superhero. I didn't like reading this book, and it wasn't even close to the best book I've ever read. The only part that was interesting was a sixteen year old punk, becoming a hero. Other than that, I didn't like it. it's hard to follow, and it's way too long, it took forever to read. Three stars isn't bad, but it wasn't the best. I would have rather picked something else to read. What kind of name is the Blue Avenger? Overall I didn't like it, it's not even close to a four, or a five.

The Rudest Alien on Earth is a really good book. The author wrote it so well; I didn't want to put the book down and stop. The Rudest Alien on Earth is about an alien who came to Earth on a mission from her planet. So, the whole book talks about her adventures on earth.One thing that thought was interesting was wondering what she would turn into, because she was not in her normal shape. She toke the form of things on earth, to blend in with everything. Some of the things she turned into were a dog and a fly. Another thing I thought that made this book good was that it explained things on earth. This happened because the Alien didn't know what any thing was on earth was. So one girl helped the alien out the girl explained things that we all know of. A couple of thing the girl had to explain was stories and what school was.Also something I thought that was neat; is that the alien was great at Math. She could do very hard problems in her head quickly. This was way different then the little girl who wasn't good at Math. She even said that she hated Math and numbers.The Rudest Alien on Earth was one of the best books I have read. If this paper sounds like a good book then you will most likely like this book. Plus this is only some of the good things about this book.

This book is about an alien that was sent to earth to gather information about earth. While on earth, the alien finds friends and wants to learn from them. While she was learning from them, she forgets the rules she was supposed to follow and gets into a lot of trouble on her visit to earth.What I liked about this book was that I was very funny. I liked the thought of alien traveling to earth and finding as much as she can about earth she can. In addition, the alien could change forms and I was always waiting for what she would turn into next.I did not like this book because every other chapter was told by someone else. The alien told one chapter then a human told the next. I became very confused about half way through the book because I never knew who was talking.

Well have you??? Well if not perhaps you want to read the book about The Rudest Alien on Earth.It is kind of a cunfusing and a little weard to read. The main caricter is very weard because she is always changing from one thing to the next.One time she is a humen then she is a dog then all of the suden she turns into a invisible person that can do any thing that she wants to do.I did not like the ending because it dos not have an ending it just lets you kind of hang their with out any ending.If you would like a chalenge then this would be a good book for you.

Deep is about a girl named Birdwinkle, Birdie for short, and a girl named Morgan. Birdie is a 14 year old girl who lives in Washington state and is sick and tired of all the rain. She has a deep passion for writing. Her best friend went off to another school years ago, but she came back only she's not as good of a friend anymore. Morgan is a 17 year old girl who lives on a ship by herself. She use to live with her mom, dad, and sister until her sister died and Morgan snuck off with the boat by herself. Birdie's family decides to go on a vacation. They go to Florida and meet a very nice, good-looking guy with a big scar. Birdie goes with him on a boat not knowing that he's actually kidnapping her! He says his name is Nicolas. Nicolas gives Birdie certain drinks that make her sleep so she doesn't know where she is. They go to this island that he claims belongs to him. Then, one day, this girl comes to the island. This girl happens to be Morgan. Birdie and Morgan are forced to survive together in a small area. Read this book to find out if Birdie ever gets to see her parents again, what happens to Morgan, and what happens to "Nicolas".I really, really liked this book. It is told from two different point of views (Birdie and Morgan), which I really liked and it's the kind of book that you don't want to stop reading because you want to see what happens to Birdie or you want to see what happens to Morgan or "Nicolas". This is my favorite book I've ever read! There was nothing I didn't like about it!

The Second Summer of the Sisterhood, by Anne Brashares, is a book about one summer in the live of four teenage girls. Tibby, Bridget, Carmen, and Lena, otherwise known as the Septembers, do everything together and have been best friends all their lives. They all share an amazing pair of jeans that fits all of the girls. The book picks up at the beginning of the second summer that the girls use the jeans. You have to read the book to find out their crazy rules for the jeans like, they can NEVER be washed, and what happens to them this summer.I liked this book because it is a heartwarming story of life, love, and friendship. You follow the girls through highs and the lowest of lows, to the end of their summer when they are reunited.One thing that I did not like about this book was how slow the book seemed to got started, but if you stick with it you will be in for an awesome ride. The second summer is a sequel to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. I recommend that you need to read the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants first because you might be a little lost when the second book begins, but you don't have to. Any female over the age of 10 would like this book. Happy reading!

All-American Girl is about a teenage misfit. Samantha Madison has wiry, copper-red hair & an all black wardrobe. SHe is your avergae rebellious girl. She spent most of her life hiding in the shadows of her older cheerleading sister and younger genuis sister until, she saves the President of the United States from an assassination attempt. Now she's constantly followed by news reporters and is the most popular girl in her school. Will her lfe ever return to normal? Will she be able to venture from the spotlight long enough to realize who she's fallen in love with?Meg Cabot is a wonderful author. She's written the Princess Diaries Series and if you love Mia Thermopolis you won't be disappointed by Samantha and her crazy life.I feel that All-American Girl could easily relate to any teenager, even the non-rebellious. You learn that maybe just because you're labeled one way doesn't mean you must act that way. If you're popular you don't have to own an all Abercrombie and Fitch wardrobe. If you're not popular it doesn't mean you have to be a goth or punk. You don't have to be an individual either, just be yourself. The story also teaches you to see a situation and life for what it is not just what you know or think.

I thought this book was a very good book. At most points I didn't want to put it down. I gave this book 4 stars because it was very good. What I didn't like about the book was how the narrarator told the story. I thought it was kind of difficult to read because I got confused in spots. Summary of the book: This girl really doesn't fit in at school, and she has a crush on her sisters boyfriend. Her punishment for selling her drawings at school is to go to an art class. There is where she saves the president life. The book just describes how she goes from a social outcast to the most popular girl in school, and how she deals with the publicity from saving the life of teh president.

You need need to have a great imagition to read the hobbit. Most of this book is all fantasy about dragons, dwarves, hobbits, elves, and all that other fantasy stuff. Also the names of the people and places are so long, thy'er hard to pronounce. You can't remember the names of some of the charactors because some of them are so similar. Another reason why i gave this book two stars is because it has a very slow start. there is no adventure or excitement at the begining of the book.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoeix is number five out of a seven book series. What I don't like adout this book was that the begining was so long. What I also did'nt like that Harry was exspelled just because he cast a spell to help his cosin witch he dosen't like. What I liked about this book was that Harry left his aunt and uncle even thought he was exspelled from Hogworts. I also liked that Harry got to see his friends this year. This is what I like and dislike.

I didn&#65533;t really like this book; it started out slow and never really sped up. The book was not very long but it could have been much shorter. I think that the book was dragged out making it longer than what it needed to be. Also, it was confussing at the beginning because it kept switching to different character&#65533;s point of view during the chapters. I think that the book could have been just as good if it stuck with only one or two characters and still be good. Instead the author portrayed almost every character&#65533;s point of view. I thought it made it con fussing but someone else may like it.This book is about a fourteen year old girl named Anna Sophia Lockwood who can go through time. She had visited time before and fell in love with a boy named Strat who belongs to a rich family. When she comes to visit again she finds out that Strat&#65533;s dad had put Strat into an asylum because he talked to other people about Anna going through time. Even thought the whole family knew it was true they would not admit it to the public that way the public didn&#65533;t think that the whole family was crazy. Devony was Strat&#65533;s sister and she was very mad at Anna because she screwed up their perfect life. Devonny tells Anna that it was all Anna&#65533;s fault and tells Anna to rescue Strat from the asylum because Devvony for her dad is controlling what she can and can not do.Anna now has to fit in with another century and avoid the dangers of not having a male escort. [Many women in those days were thought to be an outcast of a family if they don&#65533;t have escorts.] Anna has to overcome many hardships in order to survive the wilderness on her own; also she has to look out for Devvony&#65533;s fianc&eacute; who will stop at nothing in order to get Devvony&#65533;s family fortune.

...I liked this book a lot. One reason I like this because the action never stopped. I liked this book and I don't usually read books. This book is about a boy who came out of hiding because he was a third child. He goes to a school for boys called Hendricks School For Boys. He hangs out with some boys that he later finds out that are third children. But one is an imposter. He later passes a "test." That he can blend in with the real children because this school was actually made for third children.

What would you do if you woke up one morning, took a shower in the dark, and shortly afterward, realized that you were invisible? In this book, you can read through the trials and tribulations that 15 year old Bobby faces when he wakes up invisible, as well as the new people and challenges that Bobby meets. Through games of hide and seek with the police, truant officers, the police, and his nosy neighbor with way too much time on her hands, Bobby isn't sure if his life will ever be back to normal.I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read, not paced too fast or slow, with a very original plot that was unlike any I've ever read before. It's not part if a series, but there would be no surprise if Andrew Clements wrote a sequel for his cliffhanger ending. I think most teens would enjoy this laugh out loud book because it's about a teen.

This book is about a boy named Bobby Philips and he goes through life where nearly no one in the world notices him. Because the time when he smiled at the most popular girl and it was as if she just looked right through him. So one day he wakes up and goes into the bathroom and takes a shower and when he gets out he wipes the fog off of the mirror and sees nothing. So he wipes it again and still sees nothing. It's like people didn't see him before and now they never will. He can not tell anyone except his mom and dad. Because if someone told he would be big news on everything and everywhere. He can't do anything no school, no friends. He officially becomes a missing person. Then one day at the library he meets this girl. Her name is Alicia. She is blind so she can't see him. He can't resist talking to her. And he thinks he can trust her. So he is trying to have her help him get his life back. I don't want to tell you the end. You'll just have to read it yourself.

The book "Fighting Ruben Wolfe," by Markus Zusac was probably the best book I have ever read. Th librarian at our school recomended it to me, and at first I thought that I would feel like quiting after the first chapter, but the book kept me in suspense from page one. Some reasons why I like this book was because of all of the action in it, and how it kept me interested. It also didn't have a lot of complicated vocabulary that I couldn't understand. If you liked the book "The Contender" I would highly recomend this book.The book is mainly about two 13-year-old boys named Ruben and Cameron Wolfe who are twin brothers that have a very poor family that is struggling to pay bills and eat. But then one day a guy by the name of Perry who owns a boxing arena saw them fighting in their back yard each with one glove. Then Perry pursuades them to become boxers. Cameron struggles a lot in his matches, while Ruben goes undefeated with all TKO's. Cameron eventually gets jealous of Ruben, because Ruben is not only getting more attention in the arena and at school, but a girl named Stephenie, who Cameron likes, now wants to go out with Ruben. Will the brothers eventually solve their problems at home and in life in the end? I would recomend this book to anyone who wants a book that is interesting and fun to read.

Whirligig is a very good book for teenagers who feel or have felt lost and alone. Brent Bishop, the main character in this book, makes a fatal mistake and winds up in the four corners of the United States building whirligigs. After you get into the book and figure out what's going on it makes pretty easy reading. The only hard part is the beginning of just about every chapter. It switches you to a new place and it takes about three pages to figure out where you're at. This book has a very good plot and it makes very interesting reading. It's cool to watch how the character changes throughout this book. I would recommend it for anyone.

I gave this book 3 stars. One thing I didn't like about this book was that a street cleaner ran over a girl. What I lik adout this book was that the girl's mom didn't make the guy go to jail, she made him make the guy make 4 whirligigs and put them in the 4 coners of the United states and those states are Washington, Californi, Florida, and Maine. On the whirligigs he had to make them look like the girl Lea.

Lucas is about a teenage girl, Caitlin McCann, whose mother is dead and she lives with her father on an island. Her brother Dominic comes home from college and is very unloving toward Caitlin. She is at a very difficult part in her life and being harassed by an older teenage boy, Jamie Tait, doesn't help matters. She seems very self-satisfied, but deep down has a lot of confusion and questioning about herself. There are also a lot of people who disappoint her, such as her friend Bill who goes from a good girl reputation to a bad girl. Throughout the story she meets a guy named Lucas who is troubled as well, but for many different reasons. What happens with Lucas and Caitlin you will have to find out for yourself.I really enjoyed Lucas and I thought the characters related well to real-life and the situations were also very real. They were situations that teenagers are faced with and can relate to. I like the plot of the book and it kept me interested in what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to a lot of people.However, I did not like the end of the book. There was a lot of good things that led up to the ending, but if I were writing the story I would make it end differently. The beginning of the book was also a little bit of a downfall to me. I believe I think this because it wasn't very interesting and compared to the rest of the book that was really interesting, the beginning seemed boring. It very quickly became interesting though, so the beginning wasn't horrible. So, if there was one thing I could change about Lucas it would definitely be the ending.

The book Guts is an autobiography about Gary Paulsen. All of the adventures he has been on. How he survived as a kid when he ran away or like the first time he got a book when he walked into a library and an old lady gave him a library card. He has many stories about how he was attacked by moose and how he was saving peoples lives by driving them to the hospital in an ambulance. All of the great stories he has for you it just captures you and makes you want to read and read till you get tiered. The part of the story I liked the most was when he was hunting and got attacked by a moose. A simile that really fits this book is hatchet. This is a great book and I would recommend it to any reader.

To understand what is going on in Armageddon by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, you must read the first ten in the series. The series begins with Left Behind. It starts when all the devote Christians vanish. Rayford Steele, the main character, lost his wife, Irene, and his son, Raymie. He only has his daughter Chloe left.When everybody disappeared, Ray was a pilot on a plane. Hattie Durham, a flight attendant on the plane, was the person Ray was going to cheat on his wife with. Cameron "Buck" Williams, the second main character, is a senior writer for a New York magazine. Eventually, Ray, Buck, Chloe, and Bruce meet. Bruce is the new pastor at a church because the old one vanished. They all become Christians and form the Tribulation Force. More and more people join the Tribulation Forces while Nicholae Carpathia takes over the globe, without any disputes, as the devil. Some Christians die, while others become Christians. Just in the book Armageddon, two original members die, one other member dies, and another original member gets seriously injured. A lot happens in this series. Three couples get married and one couple has a childI pretty much liked everything in this series. The only part I don't like is when the characters are waiting for some reason and the way they switch milieus all the time. On one page you could be reading about Ray flying a plane, then it goes to Bruce preaching a sermon. It all makes perfect sense, though. I don't think this book is similar to anything I have previously read. I really, really suggest this book to everyone.

This book is about a hare named Tammo. He wanted to be in a group of highly praised hares called the Long Patrol. The long patrol is a bunch of skilled hares that defend a huge mountain called Salamandastron; this is also where they live. A squirrel named Russa Nordry is taking Tammo to be in the Long Patrol. He gets with the Long Patrol and there is only a small group of them. They are going to Redwall abbey to help them from the big army come to the abbey. The abbey is full of peace-loving creatures such as; mice otters, and moles. Before the war the abbey has gone through problems. To find out more and what happens to Redwall, read the book.Some things I liked about the book were that it had a lot of action and action and suspense throughout the whole book, especially at the last battle at the end of the book. Many events take place during it making it a very suspenseful book. There is many more things I liked about this book, but I can't tell you all of them.Some bad things about the book are: it's only a type of book for people who like war. It also took a long time to pick up. There was barely any action at first, but when it picked up it got really good.This is a good book and I recommend it to people who like suspense, war, and action.

White Fox Chronicles is about a 14 yr old kid who escapes from a CCR concentration camp in the year 2056. Cody will then return to blow up the camp. After Cody escapes to an Army base he goes on journeys blowing up other concentration camps and weaponry warehouses. Cody then earns the reputation of the White Fox for his brains and bravery. Some things I liked about the book was the detail it went into. Like the part where Cody was walking through the desert it explained how blistering the heat was. The part I didn't like was the length of the story I wish it would go on farther or have a sequel. If you want to know more about the story read to learn more about Cody's friends.

The book what daddy did was a true story about a boy named Preston who had the perfect life and family, but then his parents began having arguments and fought all the time until one day his father mother moved out. Preston went to live with his dad and with in a few month time period his dad could no longer handle the pressure and had a nervous break down ... he shot his wife and left Preston not knowing whether to forgive and forget or not. His father has just been released from prison after three years after the murder and Preston begins his battle of forgiveness.I like this book because it was suspenseful, the book was very emotional, and you felt as though you were right there along with Preston and his family as they got the terrifying news. This is a catchy book and I know you will not want to put it down.People who like suspense and thrill would be the people who would enjoy reading this book, and it has that love of a family feel to it, for those readers who do not appreciate the death as much, so it is a great book for anyone.This book includes everything anyone would want to read!

I just got done reading the book 'That Summer'. This book is about a teenage girl named Haven. She goes through many good times and upsetting times. This book is a very gook book to read if you like to read teen issues. I would like to recomend this book to girls, because the main character is a girl. Many of the things that Haven goes through girs would be able to relate to, and the boys would probably think that it is boring. If you have an older sister that you fight with a lot, but deep down inside you know that you love her, this would be a perfect book for you. Haven and her sister fight quite a bit, but when it comes down to the times when they need each other the most,they're there for each other. If you're looking for a good book take my advice and read 'That Summer'.

THE HEAVNELY WORLD SERIES is a book with many short stories. I didn't realy like the book because I got the my characteres mixed-up form story to another. The book starts in the early years of baseball, and ends with baseball in the last 50 years. This book would be good for people interested in the history of baseball. I didn't find the book interesting untill the end, when I was familuar with some on the players. If you like old stories of small town, barnyard, baseball up to today campetition of baseball, I would recommend this book to you.

I give this book three stars, because I think it could have had more events in the plot.Stand Tall was a book that really doesn't have a story plot. Instead of a story plot it has a good theme.Stand Tall was about a seventh grade boy named Tree. Tree was called this because he was really tall for his age. Tree was picked on a lot because he was so tall, and he wasn't very good at sports. Tree met a friend named Sophie and Sophie was an eighth grade girl that hot picked on by the popular girls. Tree had a grandpa named Leo who fought in the Vietnam war. Leo got his leg shot and had to have it amputated. Tree's parents divorced and he is still having problems expecting it especially during Christmas. Then something happens to their town and everyone has to stay at the school. Tree's dad's house is badly damaged so they have to fix it. Tree's brothers, Larry and Curtis, come home from college to help. Tree starts to feel that he fits in at the end of the book.The strength of this book is the theme it gives. The weakness would be that it keeps repeating itself. I would recommend this book because it has a really good theme.

This book is about a really fat kid named Zachary that is a freak show. He lives in a trailer and everyone always comes to see him. One day his owner leaves him and says he will be back in a few days. Well these two kids Toby and Cal become friends with him and they learn about his life and everything else about him. The police said if his owner Paulie is not back two weeks or so he will have to send him to social service home. You have to read the book to find out if he goes or not.This book is really funny so I hope you get a chance to read it and if you like books about friendship then you will really like it. A part that I did not like about this book is the part when everyone made fun of Zachary

I read the book Being Dead by Vivian Vande Velde. This book has seven stories in one book. The first story was the best. It was about a girl named Brenda and her family moving to a small town. When they were unloading boxes, the phone rang. Brenda picked it up. The answer was a bell ringing like the ones on a bicycle. A little voice said,"Help me." and that was all. Brenda's dad came into the house and said,"Brenda, the phone wont be hooked up until Monday."See how Brenda gets through all the other weird things that is happening to her.

I read Just Ella from Margaret Peterson Haddix.It was about a girl named Ella. She was a servent for her mean step-mother. The family is invited to the princess ball but Ella has to stay home and clean the celler. Secretly she goes to the ball and is picked by the prince. After a week she hates the castle life. Read the book to find out what she does and how she got to the ball.I didn't think the book was to bad. I realy don't care for the cinderella story but I love all the books from Haddix. They're easy to read and very interesting. She made the Cinderella story very interesting with her own twists.If you like this book you should try reading the other books from Margaret Peterson Haddix. Try reading Take Off's and Landings, Amoung the Hidden, Amoung the Imposters, and Turnabout.

I really like this book. I am a wrestler. This book is about wrestling so if you enjoy wrestling you will like this book. It's not all about wrestling either. There's a girl in the book who Ben, the main character, likes and he tries to make her like him. Ben is a senior at Sturbridge. Him and his three best friends are in wrestling and have been friends since the sixth grade when they met at a wrestling camp. His friends are Didget Al and Hatcher. They call him Didget because he is missing one. Didget wrestles 130. Al wrestles 135 along with Ben. Hatcher wrestles 140. Al is the best 135 pounder in the state but Ben is also a good wrestler but they are in the same weight class. They wrestle off every Wednesday to see who gets the position. Al always beat Ben just by a little though. Al gets suspended during districts because of a prank he pulled. Ben gets his spot and gets first at state. The following Wednesday Ben want to wrestle off Al to really see who is the best wrestler in the state.

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was a very good book about a group of girls that are best friends and have been for almost all their life. This summer the girls are going different places and are afriad that they all might grow apart from each other, but they are kept together by a pair of jeans that seem to fit everyone just right. Throughout the summer, and all their problems, the traveling pants get to be sharred by every girl, so they all good wear them at least once. Along with the pants, came a list of rules you have to follow, like each time they sent the pants to a differnt girl they had to write a letter, and you also could not wash the pants. They hope by the end of the summer they all will still be the best of friends. This book was exciting and interesting, but at times it just gets a little boring because it talked about the same topic for such a long time. Otherwise it is a pretty good book about friendship.

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was an awesome book. It tells about how four best friends live without each other all throughout the summer for the very first time. It tells about their summer apart and what they do. Carmen goes to a bargain store and buys a pair of clearance jeans because they look like they need to be worn. Tibby, Bridget,and Lena also try them on and the jeans fit every single one of the girls perfectly. So for Carmen,Tibby,Lena,and Bridget's first summer away from each other they that each of them will get the pants for a certain amount of time and then the pants to a different friend. That way they would always have a part of each other when they were wearing the pants, but they write a set of rules for the pants. For example, rule number one is that they must never wash the pants. For the summer,Lena goes to Greece to meet her Grandparents for the first time. She also meets a boy named Kostos, who has a crush on her and then the crush reverses and she likes Kostos. Carmen wore the traveling pantsto see her dad she hardly ever sees because her parents are divorced and she is suprised by how much he has changed. Tibby who stayed home while all her friends were on vacation, makes a new friend and learns not to judge people before you get to know them. Bridget goes away to an all girls soccer camp in Baja, California, but the coaches aren't all girls. She falls in love with a coach and to see what happens next to all these girls, you'll have to read this awesome book about friendship!

The Sister Hood of the Traveling Pants was a great book. It is one of those books that you keep reading and never want to put it down. This book is mostly a girl book. It tells about many troubles teens have to go though and deal with. It is about four best friends that go away for the summer and take with them the traveling pants. The pants are what every girl would wish for. No matter how big or how small you are the pants will fit you and they will make you look good. Each girl takes turns while on vacation with the pants and on the way they find love,fun memroies,and more friends. If this book sound good to you then you would also love to read Sloppy Firsts by: Megan McCafferty.

This book is about four girls named Tibby, Carmen, Bridget, and Lena.The four girls are going away for the summer, and think it will be weird since it's the first time they have ever been away from each other. Before they leave the girls discover one pair of pants that fit each of them perfectly. The four friends decide to let each of them have the pants for one week over the summer. Many exciting experiences happen to them while the pants travel all over the world.I liked many things about this book. First of all, I liked how close the four friends were because they reminded me of my friends and me. I also thought it was funny, and a good book. Being able to relate to the characters helped me enjoy the book even more. Finally, I like how the book was written, and thought the plot was well thought of.Even though, I enjoyed the majority of the book, there are some things I didn't like about The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. I didn't like in the middle of chapters they would change characters who were talking. I also didn't like what happened at the end of the book to Tibby, Lena, and Bridget.In conclusion, I thought this was a very good and funny book. If you enjoy reading those kinds of books; then this book is defiantly for you.

This book is about some mice and their plan to destroy Jupiter and all he stands for. One of the mice gets caught and they have to rescue her twice. How many times and how far will they go to save her from the rats? This book is filled with adventure, deceit, and wondering. Every corner reveals a new adventure. They also hold a life and death struggle. If the mice do not stop him no one will.I thought this was a good book because it was filled with adventure. It picked up kind of slow but after chapter one it kicked into high gear. The rats are very mean and hide a lot from their fellow rats. Beliefs, food, and other items are hidden from sight, and only the owner knows where to find them. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat but only after it picks up.

I read the book Ghost Soldier. It was a good book at some points. At other points it was confusing did I did not know what they were talking about. The book is about a boy who's mother ran out on him and his father when was ten. Know his father has fallen in love with this lady from North Carolina. The boy's name is Alexander. He still thinks that his mother is coming back and they should not move down to North Carolina. I don't want to tell you the whole story but the last thing I can tell you is that Alexander mets a ghost and gets caught up with what is holding the ghost back from resting in peace.

Ghost Soldier is a perrty good book. If you like ghost stories. The book deals with the Civil War. Ghost Soldier is not the best story to read. I think the book could of been longer. That is the only thing I don`t like about the book. The story takes place in North Carolina. the main person in the story is Alexander. I like the story just because, it deals with ghost. It all depends on what you like to read. You may like reading Ghost Soldieror you may notlike it.

This book is about a boy that is normal but yet not. He has parents and he has friends. He is normal for the most part, but at times he will go psycho and be very mean. His parents are scared at times because of the way he acts. How it ends is up to you to read this book.Things I like about this book are that it doesn't use words that you have to grab a dictionary and look it up. This book does have a lot of action in it. It doesn't get confusing often, but will every once and a while.Things I didn't like were the lack of details used in this book. The book needed more conversation and it would be much more interesting. When it gets confusing it gets really confusing.

I think "Soldier Boys," by Dean Hughes, went from excellent, to good, to average. I think the book had a beginning, middle, but not a great ending. The story tells the tale of two young soldiers, one from Nazi Gremany, and the other a high school drop out from America. It tells a story about War World 2, and it shows the opinion of the war in two different perspectives. At the end of the story one of the soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice-in a very brave way-in a book that ends rather quickly. But, it will keep you wanting to read more and it is a very educational novel.

The Year of the HangmanBy: Gary Blackwood*****The Year of the Hangman took place back when the thirteen colonies. Creighton was a fifteen year old boy who was kidnapped and brought to the American colonies. He comes to the American colonies and becomes a political unrest. On the way he had a mattress with no pillow and no blanket. He had to stay in a chamber with very little food. When they were out at the ocean the people who kidnapped let him out so he could have some fresh air. Then he got to talk to the captain that kidnapped him. He got a letter from his mom and it said that his mom let them take him to be with his father.One of the strengths of the book is it had a lot of history and I like history when there is a war. I also like when he ripped the paper up and he tried to throw it out the window. One of the weaknesses was the confusing start of the book when they were hanging all of the people.I would recommend it to people who like war and like to listen about history.

This book is about a number of people and things. Some people that it's about are Pete Rose and Ken Griffey Jr. There are broadcasters in the book, one is Joe Nuxhall. There are many other people in the book, too.Some things that I liked about the book was, there was a collection of short stories. It also had some pictures. There weren't pictures about everything they talked about. If you didn't like one story, it wasn't so bad because the whole book wasn't about that. You could keep going with the book.Somethings I didn't like was, it had some stories that didn't make sense. Those stories were around five pages long. Other than that I liked the book pretty well.

In this story, a young want to be witch, Tiffany, is sent on a journey to find her stolen brother, Wentworth, who the Queen has stolen. On her journey, she meets tiny blue men named the Wee Free Men who are Scottish men addicted to drinking, cursing, and fighting. Along the way, they seem to protect Tiffany from ferocious dogs and other magical things. Finally at the end of the book, she meets the Queen, but there is a little problem. Find out if the Queen can negotiate with Tiffany to get her little brother back.What I liked about this book is that the author chose creative names for his characters. Also, I liked the way the Wee Free Men spoke among one another. What I didn't like is the entire story plot.If you enjoy Tinkerbell with Harry Potter and a touch of Braveheart, then you'll be able to relate this to another story. Other than that, I don't recommend this to anyone.

Teddy Camden and Ian Slater are best friends. One day Teddy doesn't come home and no one knows where hre is. Ian thinks Teddy left him a message but doesn't know who to tell, or who to trust because it seems like everyone he trusts is dissappearing. Teddy needs Ian to find him, but Ian doesn't know where to look. Also they think that Ian had something to do with Teddy dissappearing. I liked this book because it left you wondering so you had to read more. The thing I didn't like was that some of it was confusing.

A beautiful young baby boy is found in a pile of shirts in a barn. Who is the mother? Was the baby murdered? All of these questions are whirling around in your head as you read this four-starred book. Soon after the baby is discovered, the police arrive with a detective named Liz. Liz accused an eighteen-year-old young lady with murder. Katie Fisher denies such an action. Katie Fisher is the daughter who lives on the farm. She is sent to trial and you will not believe what happens.The strengths of this book are that it would always have the reader hanging with suspicion of what will happen next. You are always wondering what happened to the baby and if Katie will lose or win in her trial.The weakness, in my eyes, were the visual pictures in my head of the physical activity going on throughout the book. Katie always refers back to the thoughts of a very close friend. Some of the activity involved is a little too much for me.Even though I feel that the weakness has a big hold in this book, the positives have a stronger one. I would recommend it to many people who enjoy mystery stories. This book is enjoyable to read in your spare time. I would read this book again.

This is a book about a girl that is diabetic and how she lives her life. She does think she is a vampire and she talks to people that think they are vampires. In the begging of the book she is a girl that is totally into a gothic way. Then in the end she changes into a totally different girl that you would not think of her doing. The thing I like about this book is how she talks about her diabetes and how she is living in school with the diabetes. I also like how she changes into a whole different person and how her personality changes. I really hated a lot of things in this book. The most things I hated were when she was talking on a chat room on the web, and she was talking to people that thought they were vampires and she called them stupid. I also hate when she acts like a vampire.This book is not like any books that I have read before.

This was a pretty good book overall. It wasn't the best book I have read but I didn't dread reading it. This book was about two girls who are best friends and they are going into their freshman year of school. It tells you about how their relationship changes throughout the year. There were some parts that were somewhat opinionated, but that's reality. This book is all about reality. The things that happen in this book really do happen. The meaning of this book was good, and that is why i liked this book. It shows what a true friendship is all about. It also shows who you're real friends are. It shows how through all the tough times your friends are there for you. When you enter into your high school years you will form new friendships and you will loose old ones. I think that if i was given the chance to read this book again I wouldn't, only because it is not a book that you read over and over again. I don't think that I would recommend this book to anyone, but if they asked I would say it was a good book.

Frozen Rodeo is a book about a teenage girl that lives in a small hometown. She faces many problems like boys, French class, Rodeo Days, a job, and dealing with her mother's pregnancy. In the small town though, she doesn't have a lot of things to do in her spare time. All the adventures and daily problems she goes through makes for an excellent book full of drama with some comedy.The part I liked about this book was how I could relate to the main character in many ways. Being a teenager from a small town like she was, I could understand jokes and remarks she'd make. Also the imagery was well described so you can easily get a picture in your head. However, one thing I didn't like about the book was how the author would drag things out at parts. I prefer a book that's exciting at every part. If you have ever read the book When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, you would enjoy this book because it has a lot of the same type of comedy. Also, the small town setting makes them have the same feel. I would recommend reading this book if you are a teenage girl. You'll understand more of where the main character is coming from and dealing with.

Among the Barons is the fourth book in the series of Among the Hidden, Among the Imposters, and Among the Betrayed. This book is about an illegal third child named Luke. Luke takes the idenity of a boy named Lee, who had recently passed away.Posing as a different person, Luke must deal with a new family that has many issues.Luke faces many unexpected obstacles throughout the book, and goes through daring attempts to keep his true idenity unknown.I really liked this book, for it was filled with excitement and anticipation of what would happen next. New twists were thrown throughout the story to keep your attention at all times.Though i throughly enjoyed this story, I was disappointed how it ended. The previous books of this series had a well ended story, answering all questions possible in the readers mind. Among the Barons, however, felt like a cliff-hanger to me. There were a lot of questions left pondering in my mind as to what would happen next to the characters. Despite the ending, anyone who loves mysterious and adventuresome, will love Among the Barons!
