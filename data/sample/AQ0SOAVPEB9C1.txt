The Beautiful Faith Hill Is Back At It Again. The Lead Off Single &quot;This Kiss&quot; Which Went Number 1 On Both The Country And Pop Charts.

I Would Give This Movie 2 Thumbs Up. Dan Akroyd Did A Great Job Playing The Role As &quot;Mother&quot;. The TV Ancherman Ernie Tetrault Used To Work At WRGB Channel 6 , A CBS Affiliate In Schenectady, N.Y. Which Is Nearby Albany, The Capital Of New York State. He Also Did A Great Job On The News In The Movie. It Was Also Film Right In The Newsroom At WRGB. You Would Like This Movie.

This Album Started All For The Man Of The 1990's Garth Brooks. Garth Rules! I Like His Very First Number 1 Hit &quot;If Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;. Another Song I Like On Here Is 1990's &quot;The Dance&quot;. The Song Talks About The Memory Years When Keith Whitley Passed Away. The Video For &quot;The Dance&quot; Won An Award. This CD Is Also In The Limited Series Box Set.

This Tape Is Not Good. It Shows The 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, And 1997 Events. It Should Have Also Showed The 1988, 1992, And 1995 Events Also. I Also Think That The Bret And Shown Match In 1992 Was Better Then The 1 In 1997. They Also Didn't Show The Casket Match Between The Undertaker And Kamala, And The &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, And Curt Henning, Ric Flair, And Scott Hall Tag Team Match On There.

Lorrie Morgan Has A Great Voice. I Am Sorry That She Lost Two Of Her Best Singers Her Father George Morgan, And Her Husband Keith Whitley. Keith Died In 1989 Of An Alchol Abuise. Lorrie Sings Songs In Memory Of Both George And Keith About Loving Them In 1989'S &quot;Dear Me&quot;, And 1993'S &quot;Half Enough&quot;. Sure This Lady Can Sing Like Her Cousin Loretta Lynn, And Reba McEntire. I First Heard Her Sing Back In 1988 When She Debuted With &quot;Trainwreck Of Emotion&quot; A Top 20 Hit. Keep Them Coming, Lorrie.

I Remember His First #1 Hit &quot;A Better Man&quot; Hit Radio Airwaves In The Winter Of 1989. The First Album Had 5 #1 Singles But 3 Of Them Did Not Apper On The Greatest Hits Package. His Next Album &quot;Put Yourself In My Shoes&quot; Released In The Fall Of 1990 Was A Great Album. The Title Track, Loving Blind, And Ware Are You Now Where #1 Hits. His Third Album &quot;The Hard Way&quot; Released In 1992 Had Some Good Songs On It. We Tell Ourselves And Burn One Down Where Top Ten Hits When My Ship Comes In Was A #1 Hit. His Next Album No Time To Kill Released In The Summer Of 1993 Had The Number 1 Hits A Bad Goodbye A Romantic Duet With Wynonna Judd, The Title Track, State Of Mind, A Good Run Of Bad Luck Which Appeared On The 1994 Mel Gibson Jody Foster Film Maverick. His 5 Album &quot;One Emoiton Released A Few Months After The Movie Was A Good Cd. It Included The Hits Where Ever You Go, The Title Track, Summer's Coming, And Life Gets Away.

After The Match Sherri Started Attacking Savage, So Elizibeth Came In To The Ring And Saved Him. Savage Was Reinstated At The Survivor Series Event Later That Same Year.

This Show Made Me Laugh. The Director Of This Show Went All Over America To Get Other People's Opinons About The Show. My Opinon Is That I Know Archie Loves His Wife Edith, Daughter Gloria, And The Son-In-Low Mike. Archie Made A Few Mistakes By Kissing The Waitress From The Resturant That He And His Buddies Went To. Sammy Davis Pays A Visit To The Bunker House To Look For His Briefcase. Edith's Cousin Maude Visits Too. It Was Sad At The End When Mike, Gloria, And Joey Had To Move Out West Because Mike Got Another Job. If You Are Looking For The Laughs, This Tape Is For You.

Mick Foley Is One Of The Best Wrestlers In The World Today. But Right Now He Is The Commishiner Of The WWF. He Had Many Battles With The Undertaker As Mankind. He Also Battled It Out With &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin As Dude Love. You Also See Mick In His Younger Years. When He Jumped Off From The House Ruff Onto The Bed Matress. This Is A Must Have.
