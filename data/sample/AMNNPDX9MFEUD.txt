It's Kind of a Funny Story is a charming, thoughtful, and slightly bittersweet look at teenage depression as well as the pressures of life for all of us and how we cope. The subject matter is well covered in scores of other artistic mediums, but that doesn't devalue this effort. IKOAFS is well written and acted, smoothly directed, and engagingly paced for a light drama.As I mentioned, the acting is superb, especially Zach Galifianakis and the young lead played by Keir Gilchrist. His shy mannerisms and geeky awkwardness are captivating and genuine, no doubt aiding by the fact that he is a teen himself. It's nice to see Galifianakis playing against his clueless stereotype and he handles the subtleties and suppressed self-loathing of his character without trying to steal scenes or chew scenery.Though it has nothing to do with the movie per se, I found myself reflecting upon a small moment in the movie when Gilchrist's "Cool" Craig is talking with the ward's chief therapist. She asks if he has anyone he can talk to about his problems and it struck me how essential that element is for all our sanity. As Craig learns, and as I have as well in my life, he isn't alone in struggling with depression. Maybe it's a casualty of our increasingly insulated life, stuck to our personal communication devices at the expense of our face-to-face interactions, or maybe I'm simply thinking too much. Be that as it may, in a society buried under countless options for staying perpetually connected with each other, it's amazing how easy it is for our social skills to atrophy or for our sense of reality to get blurred through the anonymity of these technological social venues. What are we losing in the convenience of avoiding depth?It would be easy to criticize the movie's ending but I took heart with it. Living life is not about focusing on the pain and difficulty but focusing instead on the small joys brought about by those we love and the feeling of knowing you're not alone.

With well over 150 reviews, most of them five stars, I am not going to add much to the mountain of positives. This is simply a powerful, emotional, influential, and sage philosophical novel about the timeless struggles of man. It is more than a political novel, it is much deeper and full of humanity than that. If you enjoy writing that is prescient and intelligent, that makes you stop and re-read and pause to reflect, than you will cherish this book as I did. This is not a pop fiction piece by any means, it is rather a book that will linger long in your mind, challenge you, disturb you, and leave its mark. Writing like this reinforces my belief in what we are capable of in our finest moments.

This is a great example of the Rolling Stones as they are now. It isn't anything different than the last three studio discs, but that's not to say that's it's bad. I like it, there's plenty of stuff that is solid, driving, rock along with some nice softer numbers. I miss hearing the country influences that've been scarce since the masterful "Faraway Eyes," but I've grown accustomed to their absence. The boys can still write some really nice slower songs, and I enjoy "Streets of Love," and "Biggest Mistake," but do not care for the requisite Keith numbers anymore. Simply put, Keith should pack in the whole singing bit. He's awful as a singer anymore. The charm of his occassional attempts at singing were always welcome, but the years have not been kind to his pipes. I'm not giving him a free pass just because he's the human riff, either. What used to sound great ("You Got The Silver," "Before They Make Me Run," and even "All About You") is now horrible. His voice is truly a croak and simply distracts from the song itself too much to enjoy it. My God, his treatment of "The Nearness of You" from the last live offering is painful. So it is with "This Place is Empty" and "Infamy." Please, Keith. I love your guitar playing - honestly. Just stop singing on Stones albums. In fact, those songs might have been so much better if Mick had been handling the vocal duties.Granted, most Stones albums take many listenings before catching on, but this one seems little changed from the last few studio offerings. I think that part of the problem with cds now is the insistence that more means better. Two decades or more ago, 45 minutes of music was all you would generally get from a studio offering. While much of this had to do with the format, it doesn't mean that because cds hold more music the artist must fill up the disc with a half dozen extra songs. What used to be b-side fodder, unreleased material, and all the other stuff best saved for hardcore fans has now become part of the general release, and I'm not convinced this is such a great idea. It's why I think that so many studio releases aren't as good as they "used to be." There's too much stuff that would never have been released thirty years ago - and that's a big part of the problem with this disc, too.There are at least 3 songs, perhaps as many as 6 that just should have been relegated to studio outtakes. Here are seven that wouldn't make my cut: In addition to the two Keef tunes, add "Rain Fall Down," "Driving Too Fast" (didn't they release a song just like this a few albums ago?? Come on, guys), "Dangerous Beauty," She Saw Me Coming," and "Look What The Cat Dragged In," which even a really nifty riff can't save. They sound like paint by numbers songs with vapid lyrics, simplistic melodies, and over production that would make ZZ Top's 80s efforts pale in comparison. I'm willing to bet that if you put all three of their last studio offerings into a random playing carousel, all but the most chronic Stone-heads wouldn't be able to tell what album they came from. I'm a huge fan of the band, and I'd have trouble. I'm grateful as hell to have them still making music, believe me, but they need to understand that quantity does not mean quality.

Taken on its own, this isn't a bad movie. It was a bit slow and I thought some of the casting choices were unwise, particularly Gandolfini. In the beginning when he is given the meatiest part of his role, he was doing Tony Soprano with a poorly done Southern accent. Sean Penn is good but succumbs to over-acting at times, gyrating furiously when it isn't necessarily called for in a scene. I understand that he is channeling Huey Long, but I find the best acting has some subtlety and Penn doesn't demonstrate enough in his performance.All of that aside, it is a well made movie for the most part. The novel is so extraordinary that you'd have to really screw it up to make a bad movie, and director/writer Steven Zallian shows enough love and respect for Warren's masterpiece to prevent a disaster. The book is far too long and deep to ever lend itself to a satisfying motion picture, but if you can put your knowledge of the book aside (for those who have read it), you can find enough to enjoy. The special features are well done, especially the profiles of the author and Huey Long.

There are lots of movies touting stupid acting guys (and an increasing number of gals - way to fight for those equal rights, ladies!), overflowing with bodily fluids, sophomoric sexual one-liners, random acts of nudity, and usually some kind of mind alteration. These movies used to just be scenes strung together via dumb jokes, but thanks to The Hangover and its inexplicable Oscar nomination, now they try to pass off as farce. A farce needs clever writing and insightful satire to work well. However, the writing has become so awful and lacking in creativity that no matter how much I prepare myself for movies like this; they always let me down because they end up far more stupid than funny, and far dumber and juvenile than I anticipate. How low should expectations be?The latest movie in this growing genre is Hall Pass, a movie I proudly lump with Step Brothers as: Worst I Have Ever Seen. Once again, two suburban 30-40something guys find themselves in bizarre situations thanks to their complete lack of common sense and intelligence. The dopes, thanks to their 14 year old sexual maturity (obvious gawking at passing women and personal gratification in the car outside the home), get a week away from their more-attractive-than-would-make-sense wives to get it out of their system. Let the madness begin. I've seen episodes of Gilligan's Island that worked better than Hall Pass.What bugs me about this movie and Hollywood entertainment as a whole, is how often guys are portrayed as sex-obsessed, parentally challenged, clueless, spineless, geeky, immature morons. Yet, in every case, they are married to superior-in-every-way women who for unknown reasons tolerate these idiots. What does this say about how we view gender roles? Is this the concept of marriage that our society reflects, as seen in the mirror of Hollywood?Highly recommended...that you do anything but watch this movie.

Nearly twenty years after the fact, I caught Grand Canyon for the second time today. While I don't have as much distaste for it as I did back then, it still doesn't do much for me. As I often do, I read the positive reviews and the requisite negative comments to those who gave it one star to see if I missed something. It's always amusing to me how people chose the ridiculous and arrogant reply that someone "doesn't get it" if they happen to dislike a movie. To that end, there is little to get about Grand Canyon. It certainly isn't subtle and neither is the smugness that runs throughout it. This is a rich white guy's movie version of Rodney King's plea for everyone to get along.The character of Mack, a Wonder Bread Angelino if there ever was one, stands at the center of this movie because he has an encounter that jolts him out of his mid-life ennui, but he spends so much time wrestling with his inner motives that I'm never quite sure he has really made the transformation. Comically enough, the producer played by Steve Martin is arguably the most honest of them all, although an argument can be made for Danny Glover's Simon, the moral center of the movie. Both of these characters see the folly in looking inward to the point of being blind to everything around you.Kevin Kline's Mack agonizes over his lost opportunity to pay it forward and then wrings his hands over the choices he makes to finally rectify this colossal life crisis. It's a grandiose and eager-to-a-fault premise that simply didn't work for me, possibly because Mack is a largely unlikable person. He cheats on his wife but then has a change of heart and simply wants to pretend nothing happened. The girl he fooled around with (played by Mary-Louise Parker) is suffering from heartbreak and the feeling of being used, exacerbated by the fact that Mack is her boss, yet Mack can't seem to understand why she wants to quit. Even though she tries to explain, the point is lost on him. Just how aware is this guy? He wants to save Simon (who clearly doesn't need saved at all) but can't see the problems with his secretary or even empathize with his wife's desire to adopt an abandoned baby. Mack wants to help but in a narcissistic way - he wants to clear his conscience and feel good about himself and seems oblivious to everyone around him. I'm never convinced his motives are greater than his own self-satisfaction.Mack is a weak person trying to make a difference in the world yet by-passing the most obvious places to start. In short, there is no need to have Parker's character in the movie at all because Kasdan choses to do nothing with her and, worse yet, make her seem unstable and pathetic. It's more important that angsty Mack fix up his newfound black friend with a date than address the far-more pressing issues staring him in the face. In the end, all's well that ends well and the credits roll as all the happy people stare in awe at the Grand Canyon.Grand Canyon is a lightweight social commentary that plays more like a feel-good movie than a powerful observation (e.g. "Crash"). There are some decent scenes but it says very little in the final analysis. It's a movie that seems to not fully understand the tragic joke in Martin's comment that all of life's answers are found in the movies; as if Kasdan wants us to believe he's being ironic when in fact he was being serious.

I'm usually not a big fan of movies about the business of entertainment. There are exceptions (All About Eve tops my list) but there are also plenty of disappointments and self-indulgent exercises (Tropic Thunder tops my list).Adaptation is a winking take on the movie business as well as a thoughtful reflection on passion in life. It's the latter that kept my interest and there are some shiny pearls of wisdom dispensed. Keeping things moving are three excellent performances by Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper. Streep is no surprise, Cooper is always entertaining, but clearly the biggest eye-opener was Cage's dual performance as twin screenwriters who are as two sides of the same coin. Hard to believe this is the same guy who droned his way through Bruckheimer garbage and those Ghost Rider cheese-a-thons.There's lots of self-referencing, inside jokes, and irony to make me wary, but it's pulled off by the performances and pacing that kept me from falling asleep or losing interest, especially in the drawn out moments that pound to a pulp the psychological breakdown of Cage's Charles Kaufman character. Yes, it's still a movie about the movie industry and yes, the self-congratulating and needy nature of those who fly around the bulb of fame rubs me the wrong way, but it was clever and well-acted enough to keep my attention.Perhaps I'm not the best person to review such a movie because my predisposition to this genre handicaps my objectivity, but on the other hand, despite that prejudice, I still liked it. 3.5 stars

There's really no way for me to not give this five stars. None of the movies would come close to qualifying for a five star rating on their own, but given the consumer who is investigating this collection, it gets five stars because it delivers all the way.The movies are comically bad and everyone knows it, especially Dean who nods and winks and deadpans his way through the lot of 'em. Thankfully we are given his "promo" spots for the film, promo in name only because Dean rolls his eyes and sarcastically recommends these exercises in farce with as much enthusiasm and droll humor as he executes his lines throughout the quartet of films. In the same cheesy category (and sharing the same musical director in Nelson Riddle) as the Batman movie and series from roughly the same time period, these movies are campy fun from one horribly bad scene to the next. There are plenty of outrageously hilarious moments, at times unintentional such as the special effects of a nuclear missle launch or other attempts at high-tech movie making, and others just plain pandering to the stereotype of Dean Martin - swinger, like the pop-up bar in a car as Dean and Stella Stevens get crushed tooling down the highway.These movies are great fun and would go over well as a social event as well. It's just a shame that movies aren't made like this anymore. Certainly our culture needs lampooned with such endearing charm as Dean and co. did with these classics.

I didn't think this was as awful as many reviews claim, in fact I think it is "good old days" hindsight that has many claim the original was so much better. In fact, this is almost a carbon copy of the original from the musical score right down to the disturbing clone who plays Tanner. There are updates to be sure and I thought there were some unnecessary moments and changes made (why the switch from Chico's Bail Bonds to a strip club?) but it is every bit as "offensive" as it was in 1976 and it is what it is: a crude movie about a bunch of misfits who show the sleepy little world of suburbia that not everyone is a perfect little tool. Is it an original idea? No. But it does make for some good laughs and there is enough of a message, albeit a heavy-handed one, about sportsmanship, the "everyone's a winner" mentality vs. the "win at all costs" attitude, and acceptance.Billy Bob Thornton and Greg Kinnear do well reprising Matthau and Morrow and the kids are all fittingly obnoxious when they need to be.

It must be nice to remember so fondly the good ole days when all movies were chock full of plot, dialogue, and meaning. Who can forget those sci-fi and horror classics, Ronald Reagan and the chimp classics, or Doris Day masterpieces that were so real, so full of thought-provoking dialogue, and so powerfully driven by their ironclad plots? Must be nice to have such a selective memory. As for me, I know that Hollywood is by and large a crap factory and it's simply a matter of the flavor you choose. If Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is anything it is a harmless bit of cinematic fun. I'm not stupid as some reviewers suggest because I enjoyed it. In fact, I dare say that calling someone stupid because they like something so innocuous is, well, stupid, but I digress.I found this franchise and in particular this installment highly amusing, entertaining, and fun to watch and I've seen it a good half dozen times on tv here and there and I enjoy it every time. Bernie Mac is his irascible funny self, Demi Moore plays the villain with relish and joy, the cameos by the Wilson brothers, Crispin Glover, et al are additional cheese, and the ladies do a good job as fun-loving butt-kicking detectives. Let's remember we're talking about an MTV version of a tv show that was little more than an excuse for prime time soft core titillation. Anyone who attempts to argue the strength of the original series is also the same person who will tell you that Playboy is really best enjoyed for the articles.If you went into this movie looking for anything other than beaucoup explosions, cartoon action sequences, and painfully corny dialogue than you missed the boat completely. We're talking mindless amusement and not high art and in Hollywood's long history, they've always done much more of the former than the latter if for no other reason than because movies are ENTERTAINMENT FIRST AND FOREMOST. Get over yourself already.

W. Somerset Maugham has long been one of my favorite authors. He writes without self-indulgent excess, but rather with a poet's flair coupled with an economic style that demonstrates an acute sense of his audience. His work is never dull and often overflowing with brilliant insight into the human condition, particularly our weaknesses and vanities, and how far we go to fool ourselves. In The Painted Veil, Maugham addresses infidelity and one woman's struggle with change and salvation.Like an expert surgeon, Maugham's passages of Kitty's delusional rationalizations for her adulterous behavior cut to the core of relationship woes and the cheater's mindset. The strength of his words lie in their accuracy and thus, the ability to make everyone who's ever been in the treacherous claws of devious affairs see how foolish they sound. My cheeks burned in spite of myself.Yet, with Kitty, Maugham arguably pulls off a very difficult task - making a dim-witted, selfish, and shallow woman into someone readers may care for at varying points in the novel or, at the very least, not quite as loathsome as she was at first. One of Maugham's skills is to show the humanity and depth of all people, regardless of how easily we dismiss them on the basis of superficiality. It's been said that the actions of human beings can be delineated into two categories: seeking something or avoiding something. Kitty is a woman who is seeking simple pleasures, joy, and easy laughs and avoiding her mother and the mirthless world of a loveless marriage. Ironically, she ends up with the latter and it drives her to adultery. What happens after this clandestine relationship is uncovered, i.e. Kitty's voyage of self-discovery and introspection, drives the bulk of the book.Perhaps Kitty was seeking and avoiding the wrong things. It is through this sojourn that Maugham either wins or loses your support for Kitty. For many, she's simply too vain and stupid to be given the benefit of a second chance. I'm a bit more forgiving for a lot of reasons, however, not the least of which is that I believe her punishment doesn't seem to fit the crime, especially since it is compounded over and again by her cold-blooded, albeit cuckolded husband.A short caveat: There are many derogatory references to the Chinese throughout the book, often straight-up comments about how ugly they are, particularly the children. They are often referred to more often as creatures or "it" instead of viewed as equals. How you chose to take this might influence your enjoyment of the novel. My wife is Chinese and I viewed it as the ignorance and arrogance of the British at the time, both the characters and possibly the author as well. I'm not a fan of political correctness, but it seems fair to warn the overly sensitive.The Painted Veil is a sad tale full of lost people, and yet, Maugham reminds us time and again that life continues on and there are always people who are not only suffering more, but handling it with far more grace and less self-absorbed angst than the characters who form the core of this lovely novel. Additionally, what I like the most is the ending. Many people felt it was a let-down, but I rather liked that Kitty comes to realize that the path of spirituality is not as clear of obstacles and easy to walk as she envisions. Maugham reminds us that knowing and doing are very different things and that Kitty, like most of us, will stumble a lot on the path to inner peace. Like every book I've read from this gifted author, I come out of the exercise a wiser, smarter, and more understanding person.

I just watched It's A Wonderful Life again the other night and it was comforting to find that time and life can mold one's opinion. I've always liked this movie but it was generally enjoyed in the sentimental run-up to Christmas and tossed in with the rest of the holiday fare. Therefore, it was always judged as a simple feel-good holiday movie and nothing more. After last night's viewing, I found myself with a lot more questions than answers and a lot more criticism than optimism.For starters, given today's political landscape, I find such a movie a bit confusing. Why isn't Potter hailed as a job creator and Bailey Loan a victim of the invisible hand of the free market? Isn't George's method of running his bank closer to socialism than pure capitalism? Most troubling, what is the message? Is it that staying in a stifling dead-end small town and a soul-crushing job are offset by the presence of friends and family? Is it saying that one has to choose between the two?It isn't hard to empathize with George's simmering rage because he is beaten down so much by the misery of Bedford Falls that he ends up a whipped dog who settles on suicide rather than facing another day of his life. What brings him back is an angel who reminds him that two people would've had dramatically different life outcomes if he hadn't been born. Both key events occurred when he was young, so surely he could've left town and let Bedford Falls take care of itself while he pursued his dreams. Why is that the only choice - non-existence or never leaving Bedford Falls? Could he not have been the one to save the soldiers? Could he not have returned after his travels to rescue Mary from the library and raise his brood? It's all so frustratingly fatalistic.In the end, I think this movie is mismatched as a Christmas movie. The only part that takes place around the holiday is the final scenes and the larger point isn't contingent upon the holidays. IAWL is a sweet but ultimately muddled message of a movie and it is a far cry from the other Christmas Capra, the powerful and life-affirming Meet John Doe. Merry Christmas, Potterville. 3.5 stars.

Led Zeppelin's first album gives the listener a sampling of all the good, bad, and ugly that was this master group. It's starts off promisingly enough with the excellent Good Times, Bad Times, which lets everyone know just how powerful John Bonham was. We are shown more of the unique creature of Led Zeppelin on the third number, a cover of Willie Dixon's You Shook Me. It has been noted often and quite accurately that Jeff Beck's Truth came first and the parallels are there in content and in overall blues/rock theme. It wouldn't be the first time or the last that Jimmy Page took the ground work for others and rode with it, unfortunately at times taking credit where it wasn't completely due. It is on this song, however, that you realize the comparisons end. Whereas Beck's version was a bit more laid back providing an almost club-like rendition; Jimmy Page serves up his interpretation with a definitive Zeppelin exercise. This is a sledge hammer of excess and indulgence, two trademarks of this band. Page's guitar thunders along with Bonham's pounding, plodding twelve bar blues beat, Jones adds his thick keyboards, and Plant provides his unique Englishman's take on the blues wail. This is as far from Jeff Beck's version as you can get without doing a bluegrass take. In this one song, we get what Led Zeppelin is all about, taking blues/rock and beating it to a pulp with the Hammer of the Gods.Along the way we get samplings of Page's guitar mastery, influences, and knack for beefy and unforgettable rock riffs (highlights are Black Mountain Side and Communication Breakdown) and we get a blueprint for all that was to come.Zeppelin's albums show a concrete pattern of growth and development and it is easy to see how their masterpiece Physical Graffiti would not exist without its predecessors. This debut, however, is impressive for a first recording and despite the heavy handed bombastic delivery and a few missteps, the rock and roll world was changed with what this band laid down here.

It's tough to pull off something like Eros because it's a package deal. Three different minis from three different directors was truly the mixed bag you'd imagine, and unfortunately I only enjoyed one.From least enjoyed to most enjoyed....Soderberg's middle entry "Equilibrium" tries to be funny and clever but never worked for me, and listening to Robert Downey, Jr. ramble endlessly didn't help. The black and white effect was hokey and I kept waiting for something interesting to be said and it never was. It's by far the talkiest of the three and yet it says by far the least.Antonioni's end installment "The Dangerous Thread of Things" begs for harsh criticism as it has an air of pretension and art that nearly suffocates it, but the cinematography, the whimsical nature, and the quirky randomness of it made it a bit more interesting than its predecessor. His view on sexual attitudes, free spirits, and how they affect a relationship was thoughtful, but also felt a bit stereotypical. In the end, however, it was a beautiful Italian postcard that failed to appeal to me on any other level.The real jewel in this trifecta is Wong Kar-Wai's offering, a beautiful, heartbreaking, and tender work that fills in all the emotional voids the other two create. It's a shame this is the first movie because the bar is set so high that the others have nowhere to go but under...and they do.Gong Li turns in a fine performance, especially in the final scenes when the make-up is off and she is vulnerable and endearing. Chang Chen is superb as the quietly suffering tailor who blindly and faithfully pines for Gong Li's fading courtesan character. His timid uncertainty blossoms into soft-spoken strength and he demonstrates a heart big enough for both of them. It's an achingly sweet movie.Is the forty-five minutes or so of the Kar-Wai feature strong enough to justify a purchase? It depends upon how much of a collector you are. At less than ten bucks, you'd have to make the call. It's a shame this little gem of a movie can't be released as some kind of extra to another of Kar-Wei's full length movies.

I want to start off by saying that some of the one-star negative reviews are so over-the-top hateful and angry that I wonder if Cronenberg personally attacked these people. Some of the samplings include the oft-mentioned payola conspiracy, the one charming review that requested all participants in the movie commit suicide to pay for their sins, and the others who feel that they have been personally harmed via the ninety minutes of their life spent watching this movie. Beyond the obvious stupidity of such claims, they are also so full of self-righteousness that it enrages me. It's one thing to dislike a movie and give solid evidentiary reasons. It's another to insult those who disagree with you. Then again, welcome to the cultural climate that the Limbaugh generation has spawned. When someone disagrees, shout louder than they do and insult them. Hey, Fox News has built a media monster from such a philosophy.A History of Violence was a movie I enjoyed. It was recommended by a friend as we discussed movies we liked, and having enjoyed Eastern Promises and the work of Viggo Mortensen, I thought it would be good. I wasn't disappointed. One of the complaints about AHOV is that it lacks good dialogue or believable characters. I disagree. How can you even attempt to know what real mobsters are like, or what it would be like to be Joey/Tom? Personal experience? Aren't you basing your judgments on movie clich&eacute;s themselves? Do you compare the mobsters in this movie to Vito Corleone or Tony Soprano? I can't even begin to figure out how you judge what a person in Tom Stall's shoes would be like or do. Given that I have nothing that comes close to prior knowledge to build inferences upon, I found these characters to be as credible as I might imagine they could be. Furthermore, the starkness and lack of highly quotable or memorable lines is indicative of the reality of our lives which generally lack in quotable moments. How many times a day, month, or lifetime do you say profound things or act with the high integrity, moral strength, or rapier wit of movie heroes? Probably a lot less than you or I waffle with uncertainty, spout tired chestnuts, or rely on stolen lines from our favorite movies. I find the torn and confused Edie to be more realistic than if she were the hackneyed Meryl Streep/Julia Roberts/et al Hollywood heroine who stands tall in the face of her problems. I found the frustrated and angry teen son to be plausible in his explosive payback to the punks who torment him. I found the small-town cop who is only trying to do his job and yet maintain his place in the community to be on target. And lastly, I found Mortensen's understated portrayal to be perfect for such a task. Quietly seething, fighting that part of him he wishes were dead, wanting nothing but a return to the life he had before the two thugs entered his diner, and treading fragilely on the brittle surface of a life now cracked and threatened by a past that has finally caught up to him; Viggo does as good a job as I can imagine any actor doing. He fails to overact, plays it true, and allows us to see the dynamic between the two lives that violently come together for him.AHOV is not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it doesn't have to be. It is a solid piece of movie making that kept me riveted, had me questioning what was going to happen next, and gave me an ending that was satisfactory because it gave no specific answers.It is often wisely recommended that you borrow/rent a movie before buying and I agree with that. I liked this one and I think you will as well. If not, give it back and try something else. Taste in movies et al is little more than a reflection of each individual and I trust you have enough of an open mind and sensibility to understand that your opinion is solely your own and not superior to those who disagree with you.

Mao's Last Dancer took me by surprise when I watched it the other day. Given only a two star recommendation from the critics, I was expecting a schlocky cornball bit of fluff. It was instead a joyful celebration of the human spirit that avoided going too far overboard. Sure, the ending was a deliberate tug at the heartstrings, but the rest of the movie was a touching motion picture about determination and difficult choices.Mixing in flashbacks of his discovery in a small village through his training in Beijing with his initial eye-opening voyage to the United States and his instruction in the differences between eastern and western ballet styles, the story gave the uninformed (like me) enough ballet insight to stoke my curiosity but never smothered me, thus allowing me to appreciate the physical and mental demands of this art form without getting bored. Bruce Greenwood, playing against his usual nasty type, does a fine job as the ballet director and Joan Chen provides poignancy and strength in her limited role as Cunxin's mother.Mao's Last Dancer was a lovely film about courage, hard work, sacrifice, and conscience. Despite some of the more rhetorical and argumentative reviews, it is not a movie about politics. Many have criticized the movie as pro-American propaganda, but I didn't see that. To deny that China went through a dramatic period of change over the years the story takes place is an understatement, but I saw nothing heavy-handed about either side. The characters are the focus of Mao's Last Dancer. Certainly the comparisons are evident and a minor plot device, but to see this movie or even the story of Li Cunxin as strictly about the differences between Chinese and American methods of government is to be myopic and thus miss out on the beauty of the larger story.

The film adaptation of the novel The Painted Veil starts off playing things pretty close to the novel, but then veers off in a rather unfortunate manner for my liking. Instead of continuing the story, there are deviations that at first seem unnecessary and then go way off the grid into full-blown distortions.I realize that a movie that comes from a novel should be judged on its own merit. However, once you have read the book the movie is based on (and please spare me the semantic lesson), you feel compelled to compare. Comparing doesn't mean negation of one or the other. It only means that I see the pros and cons of both. Moreover, saying that one should ignore the source material when reviewing a secondary version is like saying one should ignore history lessons when reviewing a historical drama. One could require a critic to allow for a certain amount of artistic freedom, but to state that those freedoms shouldn't be taken into consideration when reviewing the overall product limits the discussion.The Painted Veil is lovely to look at, a solid drama, and a well-acted. It moves well despite being over two hours in length and a character study, and is a pleasant enough indulgence. The casting in particular was nearly flawless (exception being Liev Schreiber as Charlie Townsend), especially with the subtle yet powerful performances from Norton and Watts.The problem I have with TPV is that it differs so unnecessarily from the novel. The novel would've made a perfect movie just as it is, yet there were changes made that added subplots, scenes, and dialogue to the characters that run contrary to the way they were written, and more importantly, add nothing but empty contrivances. If one is going to make a movie that calls itself The Painted Veil and acknowledges the source of the characters, setting, and plot, what good does it do to make additions that do more harm to the source than benefit? Were these done to keep potential ADHD audience members awake, or was it done to pacify those who can't see the past as the past? In other words, were changes made to make the characters more appealing to 21st century viewers who might've been confused by the way people acted in the 1920s? Additionally, as one excellent review pointed out, the gist of the book is altered, e.g. Kitty's transformation is rendered as a mere quest for love. What a sad miscalculation on the part of the director/writer/producers.In the end, I rate the movie about 3.5 stars and wonder how much better it could have been had they not felt the need to paint a bigger smile on the Mona Lisa.

I read through many of the reviews before starting my own and found an interesting mix of opinions. One thing I do question however, and it is not specific to this novel, either. My question concerns the need reviewers have for giving plot summaries. Why? That's what the back cover is for, isn't it? And yet, the majority of reviews insist upon giving me their re-hashed versions of the story. It's the same with movie reviews, too. Ugh! Stop it already!!!Now that I've ranted, let me say that I enjoyed the book - for the most part. It wasn't life altering, but there were some passages and observations that were well done. It is a quick read, it will satisfy romantics, and it gives the uninformed a chance to dip themselves into a place and time they may never explore elsewise, however shallow that dip may be. The happily ever after ending left me a bit disappointed and the ending philosophical chestnut from Sayuri was rather hollow, but, like I said, this isn't one of those books that will alter your life. Additionally, it is hard to get mentally past the whole young, white, American guy writing as an older, Japanese woman to the point that I found myself struggling to suspend belief and allow my mind to escape completely into the story. I would most certainly want to read the true memoirs of the geisha that Golden used for much of his reference work, however! Also, for those looking for a follow-up to the movie, you will find differences, although nothing too major.Memoirs of a Geisha is what it is - a popular novel that will keep you turning pages and endear itself to you. I wouldn't recommend using it for a historical reference, but for a pleasing read it will not disappoint.

I was sad that this movie was so boring and so predictable. I was looking forward to it because I am such a fan of the kind of movies Soderbergh was trying so hard to emulate. I was disappointed. The careful planning to make everything seem so precise as it would've been sixty years ago is a nice idea, but it shouldn't involve the actors, who performed as robotically as if they too were a part of the facade. I am a fan of all of the actors involved but their performances were poor. Maguire was a cartoon thug, Clooney was wooden and dull, and Blanchett was morose and vague.Another issue I had with the film is that they added in some 21st century gratuity to the film in sex scenes, nudity, and dozens of f-bombs from Spider-Man and it seemed really out of place. I am not prudish in any way, but the jarring inappropriateness of it in this context was off-putting. There was simply no need for it outside of titillation. That works great in a Will Ferrel movie, but not here.I can't even say that this is worth it to rent unless you wait until it moves from the more expensive new releases to the cheaper stock, or wait until it puts you to sleep on tv.It's a shame that such a good idea turned out to be so dull and unimaginative where it most needed it - the plot, the writing, and the acting.

Ghost Rider isn't as bad as some of the movie versions of Marvel Comics, but it isn't a very interesting plot and the characters are very flat. There are good actions sequences and the special effects are well done but they aren't enough to keep the moving from slowing down in parts. As for the acting, Nicolas Cage is pretty wooden and Eva Mendes does little more than show off her cleavage. For a cheap movie rental, it is entertaining enough, but I wouldn't want to buy it.Two final things - I considered taking my kids to see this, the youngest of whom is 10. I am glad I didn't. Yes, I understand that the rating is PG-13, but most parents assume that PG-13 isn't so bad. In this case, I am a bit surprised. The movie is continual frightening imagery and I would warn parents of pre-teens to have a look yourself beforehand. From one parent to another it is something to consider.Secondly, during the special features documentary there is a part where the costume designer describes how she made risky back-room deals in Thailand in order to procure rare sea creature skins for the costumes including shark and sting-ray. I found her giddy attitude about making these illegal and rather unnecessary purchases to be wildly inappropriate. Her Hollywood mentality puts her frighteningly out-of-touch with the criminal and immoral world of animal trade. She acted like a teenager who'd stolen a pair of flip-flops from Wal-Mart instead of an adult who enabled the slaughter of animals for their skin, especially when you consider that no one would've known or cared what the costumes were made of outside of her small cadre of colleagues and that avoiding animal skin by using other materials would've been easy and more cost-effective. It was a shameless act of irresponsibility and excessiveness. What a sad statement.

Some Girls is a fantastic album. It has an excellent blend of styles, rocks HARD, and finds Jagger digging a bit deeper into his lyrical treasure chest to make some spot-on comments about the band, the times, and women. The oft-made reference to the influence of punk rock is more evident in Jagger's in-your-face messages than in a thousand versions of "Shattered." "When The Whip Comes Down," the title track, "Lies," and others all harken back to the days when Jagger sang about women, sex, drugs, and the state of the world. You'd have to go back to the mid 60s for songs as biting as "Some Girls." I also think that this album marks a break from the sound of the 70s albums and gives a glimmer (sorry) of the next decade.Keith's number is arguably his best, certainly on par with "Happy," and never matched since, the careening insanity of "Respectable," with Ron and Keith on riff overload, the delicate beauty of "Beast of Burden," and the wry and cheeky "Far Away Eyes," a song that would fit well on Exile On Main Street, create an excellent and concise piece of rock and roll. I'm not too thrilled with their Motown cover (never have been too keen on their Motown covers at all), but it isn't enough to take away from this gem. There are a handful of Rolling Stones albums that define the band and this is one of them.

So help me, I tried. I really tried. Paragraph upon paragraph was read, re-read, and sometimes read a third time, trying to soak it all up. My efforts were often rewarded, but not necessarily with a mind-blowing epiphany or an intoxicatingly rich literary morsel. There were many times when I found myself asking if that was all there was to the stream of consciousness rambling, the scaffold of metaphors threatening to topple under their own weight, or the lofty word choices. Yes, there was insight. Yes there was truth. Yes there was a candid essay on imperialism, racism, and the consistently mentioned eponymous phrase that lingers in all of us. Is that all? How much am I missing? I found myself wishing I had Cliff's Notes or a critical edition just to see what others more experienced in deciphering this novella had to say. Alas, I had nothing but my own head and I came up short. Nothing in this story made me pause and wonder. Nothing in this story made me want to read it again. Nothing in this story helped me to understand why it is so widely regarded as a classic. One thing that did strike me, however, is the fact that it is regarded as a book to be read by young adults. Many of the reviewers were in high school when they read it. My God, how much harder would it be at that age? I'm freaking forty-six and have lived and learned a great deal and I found it hard to plow through. What sadistic bastard would assign this to a fifteen year old and expect anything but a lot of confusion and frustration?Maybe I am not mentally up to what Conrad offers. Like pearls before swine, the book's brilliance is wasted on me. I'm cool with that. If I couldn't get it after putting my best into it, then it is something I'll never get. There are too many books out there with the label of "classic" and I'll try my luck with them. If you are like me and wonder what the fuss was all about, here's a raised glass to us all. Oink oink.

Like most reviewers, I agree that this is a visually stunning movie. The plot is heavy on the Shakespeare and as such it leaves much up to the viewer to seek answers to the questions that arise. The acting is well done throughout, especially Gong Li and Jay Chou who portrays the natural son of Gong Li's Phoenix character. According to the special features he is a newcomer to the screen, having made his mark as a pop star. I'm impressed, especially given the high rate of failure in such a career move. Chow Yun-Fat is good but was a bit over-the-top to me, flaring his nostrils and popping his eyes to convey emotion. Still, there is a scene late in the movie that was as hard to watch as I'm sure it was hard to act. You'll know it when you see it and it shows much more accurately why he (along with Gong Li) are such widely acclaimed cinematic actors.The movie packs a lot in, from the excessively opulent sets and eye candy to the Greek tragedy levels of bloodshed that come at the climax of the film. When it's all said and done, however, I felt a bit letdown at the lack of substance that I took away from the film. The action sequences leaned heavily on huge battles scenes rife with CGI trickery instead of one-on-one duals. Yes, both are jaw-dropping, but I simply prefer the latter. This movie might be your cup of tea and there is much to enjoy from a purely sensory level, but it wasn't as emotionally gratifying as I'd hoped.

Unlike some of the reviews, I found this movie to be clever, quick paced, and cute. It had some bittersweet comedy thrown in for good measure and it played as very credible and honest. One review found the characters to be repellent, but I found them to be real and flawed, as we all are. It is short as the action takes place over only a few hours, but they are poignant and satisfying moments. The split-screen was not a distraction at all and I found that at times it seamlessly allowed me the chance to enjoy this movie on another level. To explain; if you think about it, we don't interact with others with tunnel vision, we take in the whole surrounding area. Having the unique cinematic opportunity to see both reactions simultaneously gave it a more intimate feeling, adding to the reality and the integrity of this well written movie. I would not buy it as it is not something I'd care to watch over and over - this is a slice of life, a few hours between two people. I don't know about you but I don't want to re-live conversations over and over. But as a rental, it is a welcome respite from the usual Hollywood fare. The special features highlight was a light hearted chat with the two actors.

Rocks is the pinnacle for Aerosmith. The final recording in a trio of excellence that started with Get Your Wings, Rocks is the zenith of recordings for one of America's greatest bands.The production was the best up to that point, with layers of guitars making for a dense and foreboding sound (Noboby's Fault, Rats in the Cellar, Combination, Back in the Saddle) and a cd that provides aural orgasms when listened to with headphones. The lyrics are clever, raunchy, autobiographical, and at times poignant without the excesses that dogged Tyler in years to come. Everyone gets their hand in as well, with Hamilton's superb Sick As A Dog and Whitford's funky Last Child complimenting the Tyler/Perry reliability. Even the standard album closing ballad, Home Tonight, rivals You See Me Crying as one of the best that isn't titled Dream On.If you must buy just one Aerosmith album, it has to be this one. Even more essential than Toys In The Attic, Rocks is Aerosmith embracing the heavy blues sound they'd evolved to and taking no prisoners. This was the album that made them kings.

I went with the wife to see this back in the summer and enjoyed it so much we caught it a second time and just bought the dvd. I was surprised at how un-chick flick like it was. This is a well made if slightly corny (especially the less-than-satisfying ending) tale of self-discovery. The acting is top notch with Anne Hathaway being the weakest link. Her character has little to convey emotionally and she does a fair job of just that, but the other three major characters at Runway magazine are worth the price of admission. They save what might've been a cliche and turn it into a fun exploration of the world of fashion. Granted, some deep ideas (the double standard applied to powerful women, chosing between career and love) are glossed over, remember it is a fluffy movie based on a fluffy novel, so approach it as such.I agree with the general sentiment that (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Andrea should have blown off her painfully immature friends and gone for rhe gold, having the foresight to know that her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't going anywhere anyway, but she gives in to the picket fence and Hallmark duldrums instead of seizing the brass ring when it is so clearly within her view, but this is overanalysis where it is clearly not called for. Enjoy it for the light and fun treat it was intended to be - in that it succeeds quite pleasantly.

There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, so let's start with the obvious; why is Keanu Reeves in this movie? Who thinks this robot can deliver any credibility in any movie? Winona Ryder is equally horrid and her role is that much more vital. Her gasping doe-eyed schtick is woefully inadequate to convey the power and allure of the woman Vlad pledges unending blood lust in search of. Furthermore, were there no Brits that could play these two roles or were British accents really necessary at all? If so, why in the name of Bumblebee Man did they have to use these wankers who can't keep one going consistently? Gary Oldman - an actor whose work I usually enjoy - is sadly over the top in a role that cries out for subtlety, especially when you consider how much of a cliche this character has become. His garbled accent and the hokey theatrics make me want to giggle more than stay engaged. In fact, my sixteen year old daughter and I cracked up so many times throughout this that you'd have thought we were watching a comedy...and that's not a compliment. There is just so much to laugh at and mock...On the plus side, I thought Coppola's back story of the romance and all was interesting, but in the end, who cares? It is nearly impossible to immerse yourself in the story because Reeves, Ryder, Oldham, and Hopkins are so wretched that you end up wishing it was a comedy - it works better on that level. If you want a good untraditional vampire movie, go rent The Hunger instead.

Truly the unique movie that has thoroughly divided audiences, Closer is either hated or loved. I tend towards the latter although I didn't love it. I can, however, appreciate the many qualities the movie has.Let me start by taking on the many critics who claim, with stunning arrogance, that the movie is unrealistic, or that these things never happen, or that these people are so vile that the movie isn't worth the time to watch. You couldn't be farther from the truth. First of all, the events these characters go through certainly do happen, even if comprehending such stark brutality makes you dangerously self-conscious and uncomfortable. It's one thing to dislike a movie because you found it distasteful; it's another to try to cover all of human experience with the narrow blanket made up of your own limited life and stifled imagination. Secondly, the utterly repellent nature of their actions doesn't make the movie unworthy of the time one spends watching it, even if there are terribly painful moments to endure.The four characters that make up this intense drama are cold blooded, unforgiving, self-destructive, selfish, and unable to distinguish between love and her twisted counter-ego, obsession. Clive Owen is the best part of this movie, from the moment we meet him through his confrontation with Jude Law, he is a boiling, sarcastic, and ruthless mess of a man. Matter of fact, no one in this movie is very likable, even the manipulative Alice, who from her name on down to her perfectly fitting occupation, rarely plays people honestly. She tries to play herself as this wounded victim, but she has more on the ball than she's given credit for. Witness the scene at the photography studio. Roberts and Law have the far less sympathetic roles to play; and Roberts plays hers emotionally detached and self-loathingly. Law is the romantic fool who doesn't know what he wants because he is emotionally immature.Closer is a movie that I would not recommend to the easily offended, the people who are uncomfortable with frank sexual discussion, or those who don't enjoy character studies with no real plot. For those of you, I'm sure there's something on Fox News Channel you'd enjoy much more than this movie. Just don't take a wrong turn and uncover Bill O'Reilly's Jenna Jameson collection.I would definitely recommend it for struggling couples, those contemplating divorce, or singles who never seem to be able to make relationships work. There are plenty of lessons these tortured characters can teach and I'm guessing that you'll see some of yourself in these four and their repeated mistakes. If you want to know the hell of a relationship's demise, or see how not knowing yourself handicaps your ability to successfully love and be loved in return, put on Closer, hold your breath, and open your eyes wide.

I have seen most of Bill Murray's films and I generally love most of them. With all of those great films, I consider Groundhog Day his best and it is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. Bill Murray is at his greatest in this movie because herein he channels all of his talent into the role of Phil the jaded and bitter weather man from a Pittsburgh tv station.The story is a simple one of redemption and changing the path one's life is on and Murray takes this relatively simple and perhaps predictable plot line and delivers a charming and engaging performance that is never maudlin, never exaggerated and never phony. As the repetition of the day continues, Murray's Phil transforms from frightened non-believer, to scheming opportunist, to crazed suicidal maniac, and finally to a man who finally understands why this bizarre circumstance is happening to him. The movie is never heavy-handed or preachy. It is subtle, introspective, and genuine. This is a perfect vehicle for both the earlier Stripes version of Bill Murray as well as the latter day one that did so well in Lost in Translation. This gem is truly one of those eternal movies that can be watched for generations to come as you do with the really great ones. Like the crazed reality of Phil's situation, Groundhog Day can be experienced over and over and over again and always satisfy.Groundhog Day is a movie that touches your soul as well as your funny bone, and makes you feel alive and inspired. How many movies do that and are this heartwarming and fun?As for special features, I buy dvds because I want to see the movie, not because I want to watch a bunch of interviews, play games with my dvd remote control, or listen to commentaries. If they are there and they are worthwhile, so much the better, but if they are not, I still am glad I own the movie and the lack of special features would never alter my decision to buy a movie. Groundhog Day is worth owning in whatever format you can find it. Just thought I'd throw that out there....

Exile is a five star release, but the four stars are for the remix and the bonus tracks....I don't think I've awaited a Stones' release with as much enthusiasm as I did the re-release of Exile on Main Street. This is beyond my favorite Stones' album, it's my favorite recording period. The critics/fans/et al will chime in that this recording is not necessarily their best but I disagree. Everything up to this sprawling document that seamlessly blends the myriad influences with the cementing of their unique identity is the measuring stick for all that came before and after. All Rolling Stones roads lead to Main Street. Predictably, the media onslaught created from this release has brought to light all of the mythology that goes along with Exile. As has been explained countless times by all the people who were actually there (opposed to myth-making journalists and a few sycophantic Amazon reviewers stealing their most breathless clich&eacute;s), this was still a working band and all of the decadence and what-not could never have taken place to the degree of hype that surrounds the recording and still yielded any record, let alone their finest hour. There were hangers-on, dealers, and lots of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but this is not unique to the Stones. What is unique is the method in which it was recorded; in the dank and dusty bunker-like basement. It's this decidedly unusual laboratory that made this recording so inimitable. For all the talk about why groups don't make records like this anymore, the answer lies in understanding the circumstances that begot Exile on Main Street. It isn't about junkie desperation, Nazi voodoo, or all the rest of the tabloid theories. It's about a group at the peak of their creative power, exiled to an ad hoc recording studio in the south of France during a hot and humid summer. It's about a band literally living and breathing music in the very place where they could hit "record" the precise moment their muse called.But enough about the past, let's focus on the present. For starters, the original has been tweaked some and the reactions are mixed. I like it and don't feel that there has been any wrongdoing. The sound is vibrant and literally screams out of your speakers. I am able to hear so much more than I was before and there is a clarity that never reduces the grungy nuance of the beloved original. If you are really happy with your version, skip straight to the reason for the buzz surrounding this re-issue, that being the newly "discovered" material. There is a degree of disingenuousness, however, as most of these songs have been updated, including new session work (supposedly with Mick Taylor, depending on who you believe; Mick or Keith) and vocals from a Jagger thirty plus years older. New stuff from the band is always welcome and indeed, some of the songs are well done, but I wonder why they didn't pull a Tattoo You and simply re-work the songs and release a separate album of new material that didn't have to be tied to Exile on Main Street? A good song is a good song no matter when it was created and since A Bigger Bang was several years ago, why not? Furthermore, no matter how much stuff is pulled from the vaults, it's still essentially "new" stuff and trying to coattail additional material on to a firmly established classic is simply wrong in my book. Better to polish those unfinished nuggets and unveil them as their own individual jewels bridging the lifetime between then and now instead of pawning them off as some dream version of the album that should have been. For better or worse, the melodies and instrumentals that spawned these new/old tracks - some of which are good and some not so much - were discarded during the making of the record and we have lived quite happily with the amazing final product for nigh on four decades, thank you very much. The new material is simply goodies for the diehards and nothing more. It seems to me that bonus material for previous releases should focus more on alternate takes and live material from that era instead of unfinished tracks the band deemed not up to par at the time, and there is plenty of the former still hiding away. Thankfully, we get a taste of the alternatives included and the most noteworthy of these chestnuts is a truly priceless spin on Soul Survivor with Keith riffing lyrics that are simultaneously hilarious and God-awful. There is also a short but totally bitchin' instrumental called Title 5 that sounds not so much like a song as just a jam moment. For my taste, these comprise the highlights of the bonus disc for me.Sadly, it seems that the band is content to piecemeal things over the twilight of their lives instead of compiling some big box set of material, so we have to be content with what we get, I suppose. Still, last year's Ya-Ya's update and this year's Exile all point in the right direction. Given what must assuredly exist behind the locked vault doors, the Stones will no doubt one day rival Jimi Hendrix in terms of posthumous material. It's a safe bet that long after all of us have passed on, when the keys have been handed down to the band's grandchildren and the doors finally flung wide, future generations will be hearing stuff that we could only pine for when we were alive.

This is the best the Stones have done...the one to have if I had to chose just one from their vast collection. While it is quite true that Exile has all the "faults" detractors heap on it, those same who believe it is overrated, and yet, these faults are the very things that make it so beautiful to me. The sound is dense, the lyrics are mixed into the sound, there aren't enough big hits, and the album isn't the concise powerhouse of it's predecessors. Yet, it is the most cohesive, comprehensive, definitive musical statement they have ever made. They cover all their genres of influence, the songwriting prowess of Jagger/Richards reaches its zenith, and it serves as their magnum opus.The superb songs are plentiful, even if they never reached the commercial heights of "Brown Sugar" or "Start Me Up," There are typical Stones rockers replete with the Keef riffs you expect; "Rocks Off," "Happy," or "Ventilator Blues", country flavored sentiments like "Sweet Virginia" or "Torn and Frayed," roadhouse rockers like "Rip This Joint" and "All Down The Line," and soulful numbers like "Let It Loose" and "Loving Cup." By the time you hit "Just Want To See His Face," you welcome the brief quiet in the juke joint storm.Exile On Main Street is a fitting title of this masterpiece because it encompasses the thematic material herein, a broad commentary on America told through her musical roots. It's like a Flannery O'Connor novel set to music.

What is it about the lot of us who review? Despite hundreds of reviews saying what we're going to inevitable repeat, we go ahead and review anyway. Are we that anxious to get our thoughts out there for someone to read? Does it make us feel closer to the band, the fans, the music? Who the hell knows. It just strikes me as funny even as I forge ahead with my review...Self-examinations aside, this album rocks. So many great songs with many various styles from Memphis r'n'b to country, to straight ahead riff and roll. The ability to comfortably venture into different genres and emerge successfully with their own distinctive imprint is one of the many reasons I'm such a big fan of this band. There isn't a bad song on the recording, in fact there are some definitive Stones songs in the line-up. If a casual or nascent music fan wanted a Stones cd to try out, this is the one I'd recommend, in large part because it is a shorter and tighter cd than it's cousin Exile. If you don't like this album, you don't like the Rolling Stones.

This movie looses so much from big screen to small, and it wasn't because I was watching it on a 9" bedroom model. When I walked out of this movie this past summer, I was truly wowed, wowed like I hadn't been since perhaps Jurassic Park or Saving Private Ryan. Those movies, like this one, were huge rushes of emotions and action and swept you up in their intensity. Watching it at home was fun but it certainly wasn't the same, and in that lowering of excitement, I was able to view it more objectively. That said this movie is still the best of the entire Batman legacy. Then again, I think the original Adam West version is second on the list if only because of the shark scene and the bomb disposal one. Forget the schizophrenic Tim Burton visions or the two follow-ups to his pair. Burton tried too hard to be dark and scary yet couldn't resist the colors and flash of comic books, and the Kilmer and Clooney versions sacrificed all sincerity and gravity at the altar of camp and smugness. The first of these newer Batman movies wasn't bad but it lacked a really great villain. Of all the potential possibilities, we are given an effeminate Scarecrow and a horribly hackneyed mob boss. For criminals to work in the comic book world there has to be a connection between the superhero and the villain. With Spider-Man and Doc Ock, there was the scientist link and the struggle between using brains and/or skills for good or evil. With Batman, there is the damaged orphan who eternally fights his own darker, angrier side and thus the ideal villain is someone who plays up to that turmoil. Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job engendering some sympathy to go along with her psychosis with her strong turn as Catwoman, but any interplay between the two was undermined by the fatal inclusion of DeVito's disgusting Penguin character and the devotion Burton gives to the inane plot. As the maniacal and insidious Joker, however, Heath Ledger hits it out of the park. Indeed, The Dark Knight succeeds purely on the performance and writing for The Joker character. What makes it so wonderful is that the Joker is a character who cares not for the traditional bad-guy vices: money, power, or fame. He simply wants to inspire chaos for the sheer joy of seeing people devolve to the basest part of our collective human nature.As for the rest of the cast, the one thing that can be said is that they can't carry the movie on their own. Again, that's why Batman Begins was merely okay and not great. I've never been sold on Christian Bale, and his grunting "in-character" speech is just silly. With all his high-tech skills, are you telling me he can't rig up some voice augmentation? Please. Michael Caine is good but largely reduced to wise-cracking/wisdom dispensing clich&eacute;, Morgan Freeman is much the same, and Gary Oldham is relatively unspectacular. As for Maggie Gyllenhaal vs. Katie Holmes, what difference does it make? Neither does any more than Kim Basinger, Nicole Kidman, or anyone else in the bland, thankless role as Bruce Wayne/Batman's gal pal. Batman's girl was never as integral to the plot as M.J. or Gwen Stacy is to Peter Parker/Spider-Man, so why waste time with female interests? I actually like Bruce Wayne's skanky playboy vibe, the whole two-gals-at-a-time thang that gives the rather dour character some levity, so why mess with that by trying to create depth? Bruce Wayne is already quite a piece of work who doesn't need a woman to give him demons. He's already chock full of `em. Besides, if I am to believe Batman's ethos, I need to know that he has neither the time nor interest in romance because the world needs saved from itself and there just ain't the time for serious relationships. Love `em and leave `em, Batsy, there's evil to fight.In the end, however, this is a movie about The Joker and how this delectable character, arguably the best villain in comic book history, brings his toxic insanity to full bear on the world of Batman. In the hands of Jack Nicholson, I couldn't stop seeing R.P. McMurphy after a few too many mocha lattes. Nicholson played it so over-the-top that the whole movie sagged under the weight of his wink-wink portrayal. It was so clearly an actor hamming it up in a juicy role rather than something believable. With Ledger, the actor is lost in the character and we see The Joker as the man he is, a raging "agent of chaos," wrapped up in a creepy, wicked leer. The Dark Knight excels because Ledger left us with one bravura swan song, a character portrayal that accomplishes what so few comic book movies have been able to do; transcend the limitations of the comic book and create a character as memorable and frighteningly lovable as Hannibal Lecter or any of the many other great ones in cinematic history. When Nicholson's Joker died at the end of the first of Burton's movies, I was glad because it was a case of good riddance to ham acting. When Heath Ledger laughs in utter joyful mania while dangling from the skyscraper, I was sad because I knew that we'd never again get the chance to see more of this brilliant character in any of the sequels.The Dark Knight is not a fantastic movie, but rather a good movie blessed with a superb, Oscar-worthy performance.

It is fascinating the love/hate opinion most have for this movie. It garners either five stars or one star and yet I find myself somewhere in the middle. Director Sophia Coppola breezes us through Japan, be it to witness the traditional wedding in Kyoto, dashing through the Pachinko parlors, singing karaoke, walking through shrines and temples, eating in local restaurants, riding the trains, the shabu shabu restaurant, the propaganda vans shouting their messages as they drive down the street, the ladies handing out tissue packages on the street, the often bizarre Japanese tv shows, and so, so much, this movie is at times a loving home movie for me, reminding me of so much I have seen and done during my time in Japan. For that reason alone I find myself watching it now and again just to remind me of the country that I miss so much now that I am back in the states.Many people have complained of the anti-Japanese sentiment. I think they are missing the point, however. The two characters, Bob in particular, are very real clich&eacute;s of the ugly American. Rather than taking Coppola to task for making fun of Japanese people, I give her credit for showing us ourselves. The squeamishness and outrage we feel when we see these characters is purposeful. Lord knows I came across many such people in my years there and seeing this behavior in the characters made them very real to me. Furthermore, Bob's acidic attitude is symptomatic of the misery and sadness he is experiencing and the frustration that stems from such feelings which causes him to seek the most convenient scapegoats for his angst.In the end, though, most of the complaints stem from the viewers being bored to death and I will agree that there is little that really happens in this movie. It reminds me in some ways of "Sideways," both character studies where we visit with flawed and problematic people. I will also admit that before I lived in Japan I watched this movie and it wasn't nearly the same experience as it was after seeing Japan in person. It changed so much of my understanding and appreciation of the film.One of the things that did bug me some was the near perverse nature of the relationship. Charlotte is young enough to be his daughter and their wavering feelings of longing for each other didn't serve the plot in any real way. The tenderness and humanity of the film could've been accomplished with a more realistic father-daughter connection between the two. I understand that they are desperate and needy for anyone to give them some shelter from their misery. But again, I think that this point could've been made without the sexual tension. Being lonely, being sad, and needing someone to cling to during difficult times in our life need not be sexual.There is a scene about two-thirds through the movie where the two characters exchange thoughts on life, mostly Bob dispensing wisdom to Charlotte. This is my favorite part because we see the crystallization of what these two mean to each other. After days and nights suffering through jet lag, these two sleep-deprived foreigners finally fall blissfully asleep because at last they realize they are not alone amid the neon chaos of Tokyo. Charlotte nestles close in the security of her new friend and Bob gently touches Charlotte's foot and anchors himself for that moment to allow sleep to come. It's a subtle and tender moment and there are enough of these moments in Lost in Translation for me to forgive some of the mistakes. This is not a perfect movie but I give Coppola a lot of credit for making this most unusual and off-beat film.

Many have credited J.K. Rowling with reintroducing generations to reading, her clever blend of myths, the supernatural, religious beliefs, and genres, and her remarkable rags to riches story while maintaining her charm and integrity. On the other hand, I also fault her with reviving serials; endless stories about the same characters and making this element an almost crucial requirement of teen literature. There is no Twilight without Harry Potter.One thing she did pull off, however, is a maturity and growth in her writing as the series progressed. She took one fully realized story and split it into seven increasingly darker (and longer) novels. While I grew tired of the story by the sixth installment and never bothered to read the finale (although I did skim the end just to see who dies), I admire the scope of her vision.Sadly, the final movie is crushed by the expectations and hype it has generated. The sub-culture of Rowling's amazing creation grew bigger than the story itself. The supremely convoluted plot, crumbling under the sheer number of subplots and frayed strands of characters complete with their own back stories, could not fit easily into a movie, even one that was made into two parts.I'll admit this; the final movie is everything its predecessor wasn't - fast-paced, action-packed, and entertaining. In all eight of the movies, there was only one where I left the theater in stunned amazement at how boring it was, and that was Part 1 of this two-part finale. In the end, however, I felt no dramatic tension and nothing happened that truly surprised me. In fact, some of the revelations/closures felt cheap and almost laughable. Speaking of, more unfortunately absent is a sense of humor.In trying to squeeze too much into one film, there proved little room for anything else but a never-ending stream of perplexing explanations, final battles, and hurriedly cauterized plot threads. Everything was life and death serious at the expense of the charm of the first four installments; i.e., the ability to laugh at itself and the knowing wink that we're all part of the fun. The movie theater was funeral silent throughout and it was all my kids and I could do to stifle the need to snicker and chuckle at how ludicrous it all was. Within the first ten minutes or so I almost burst into laughter at the comically serious conversation between Harry and an elf. Has Rowling (with help from George Lucas and CGI) resurrected our culture's obsession with fantasy to the point where I'm supposed to not be amused by the sheer lunacy of it? Am I to accept equally World of Warcraft with The Godfather?The emotional urgency of the Potter faithful (one word: Trekkie) has become larger than the books or movies. Articles have been written about how the finale is a bittersweet cultural event and that we are all part of the public eulogy for the Potter franchise. Lost in the insane media hype assault and the sheeple consumption of all things Harry Potter is the blunt reality that we are talking about seven books that are at times fun to read but can also get incredibly tedious, which thus spawned seven movies that are generally entertaining but certainly not life-changing. It's a lightweight legend combined with the pain and angst of a teen's diary. In ten years or so, I would hope our society will look back at the past decade and feel pangs of embarrassment at how silly and inconsequential it all seems in hindsight.

This book didn't knock me out as did other Steinbeck works, but it had enough to say about double-dealings, the battle between contentment and seeking more from life, and social interactions to make it ring true. It is a comforting slice of life in a time that brought back memories to me of my own childhood, especially the views of a small town in the early sixties. The plot had some moments that threatened credibility and some of the characters were cliches, especially the cops, the drunk, and the banker who should come with his own evil music cues. Furthermore, I found Margie Young-Hunt to be a bizarre invention - a classy town skank who is embraced by the town's women as a trusted friend and part-time sooth-sayer and men as, well, a classy town skank, but she is arguably the most interesting character as well. The book picks up greatly towards the end after you suffer from a bit too much meandering and overly eager exposition. Not a starting point for Steinbeck, but a good place for further exploration.

I've no designs on being iconoclastic or a hater or anything like that, so before you read on, please understand that. I fully understand that Beatles fans can be a fanatically loyal bunch who back up their beliefs with scores of critical support from the "experts" who have annointed the Beatles as kings of rock and roll music and innovators of all sorts of styles, production values, and other musical milestones. One reviewer even had the audacity to say that this album was "unquestionably" one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century. Well, I certainly question it. Am I able to say that "Road to Ruin" by The Ramones is unquestionably one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century as well? Why not? It's all subjective no matter how much one wants to convey their expertise. This album is good but there are dozens I'd rather hear instead and that criterion alone is the sole one I use to rate albums. As with so much of the Beatles, a bit less of the excessive banner waving and veneration would be a nice change.For the record, the Beatles wouldn't place in my top ten favorite musical acts of all time, but that's just the point of my review.So then, Revolver. I don't mind it and I think the three stars is a fair rating since half stars aren't possible. Too much psychedelia, the moronic cartoon throwaway of Yellow Submarine, and the dated sound are all negatives. On the plus side, of the fourteen songs, eight are good to great, four are fair, and two are throwaways.The Good: I'm Only Sleeping is a good song and the backward solo is certainly novel. For No One and Here, There, and Everywhere are good songs indeed in the McCartney mold, with the latter being so sweet I think I should get a check-up for cavities. Eleanor Rigby is the gem of this release for me. This is McCartney at his best, and Paul is the Beatle I'd rather listen to over the others. Taxman is a great song, second only to Eleanor Rigby. Rocking, riffy, and with a bitchin' haywire solo, this one is a highlight. Good Day Sunshine is classic Beatles; the harmonies, the peppy turn of the century melody, and that golly gee-ness of so many Beatles songs, and yet I still like it. Doctor Robert, And Your Bird Can Sing, and Got To Get You Into My Life are all very good songs as well, especially the last two.The Fair: Love You To, with its harsh lyrics, is full of the Indian sitar sounds of the age. It is interesting if not altogether toe tapping. I Want To Tell You is okay but nothing remarkable, She Said She Said has the chimey sound of their earlier work mixed with some of their trippy guitar work.The Ugly: Yellow Submarine is just too silly. This is one of the problems I have with the Beatles (the other being the psychedelic sound). I just don't get the need to put ridiculous songs like this on albums. Amazingly, even with this Peter, Paul, and Mary tripe, people still say the album is the greatest of all time. How can that jibe? I just don't get it. Yeah, they have a sense of humor. Great. Save it for the outtakes. Tomorrow Never Knows? How is it that this is so frequently mentioned as the favorite song on the album? It is the most painful for me. Granted, I truly can't stand psychedelic music, and, if one reviewer claims, the Beatles, and this song in particular, are responsible for that wretched sub-genre, then that's a knock against them and not a feather in their cap. I can take Pink Floyd, some of the Beck-y Yardbirds stuff, and "Third Stone From The Sun" by Hendrix, but beyond that, take that psychedelic stuff and bury it in the ground beside the tie-dyes and hippie beads or save it for your next thematic get-together. Seriously, give me disco or the synth-pop of the 80s over psychedelic crap any day. Talk about dated music...ugh. No redeeming qualities at all for me.Lastly, I'm curious why there seems to be the need to bolster your review's credibility by citing music rags and their Top 100 lists. Either you're a mob follower feeling protected by the reputation of these rags or you're uncertain of your own beliefs and need the support of the so-called "experts." However, let's put at least Rolling Stone magazine in perspective; they recently claimed that "Presence" was the best Led Zeppelin album.Spare me the heresy bit and the condescension of "You're entitled to your opinion even though you're wrong." I'm just being honest to my own taste aka my definition of art.

While country rock might be a nauseating term in the wrong hands, the Stones laid down an amazing mix of acoustic and country flavors atop a sturdy and weathered blues and rock foundation to create a splendid album.This recording is chock-full of FM radio classics but it is in some of the less popular areas that the band really shines. No Expectations features one of Brian Jones most meaningful and, sadly, last contributions to the band's history with his easy going and smooth slide work. Jigsaw Puzzle shows some of the Dylan influence that nearly every band had to feel during this period of rock history, and Parachute Woman is a chugging acoustic blues exercise. As for the staples, Street Fighting Man has some of the most disquieting acoustic work ever laid down and Sympathy for the Devil, well...what can you say? I like how Jagger sums up the true nature of his influence with his straight forward and hippie jolting line in Street Fighting Man about how little the band can do about the times except to continue playing rock and roll. Stray Cat Blues features a murky leaden guitar sound; a scary, chugging, and threatening reverberation of menace. Factory Girl, Salt of the Earth, and Prodigal Son are also excellent acoustic driven numbers and have more country soul than the entire multitude of flag-waving, cowboy-hat sporting clowns who call themselves country nowadays.Among some of the greatest Stones' songs included herein, this album also demonstrates how valuable and vital Keith Richards is as a guitarist. He may not play with lightning speed and his lead work is limited at best, but his unique and hypnotic rhythym style and his undeniable gift for melody and song crafting are second to none in my book. If I had to pick one guitarist to start a band with, this guy is at the top of the list.

This is a great piece of American hard rock! The first side is a blistering segment of the band live with the trio covering a host of songs which come to a boil when they couple their own Backdoor Love Affair with other blues standards in a speaker-frying medley of ZZ insanity. The second half is studio and is excellent from start to finish, the closer being the widely reknowned Tush. Like Tres Hombres, there are a host of great songs that casuals fan won't know, such as Balinese, Nasty Dogs and Funky Kings, and the exquisite Blue Jean Blues. You really should own this cd.

Along with Fandango!, Tres Hombres is essential ZZ Top. There is one fantastic song after another on this recording, and while the FM staples might be what lures many in, it is the lesser known songs that sink the hook firmly in place. Precious and Grace, Hot, Blue, and Righteous, and Master of Sparks are all excellent songs that many have not heard before. The stinging, tasteful, and concise guitar work of Billy Gibbons can never be undervalued and perhaps one of the finer qualities of this master is how he never overplays. The band is always tight and razor sharp and this is an album that I never tire of. This is not only an essential Top album, it is a vital part of any rock fan's collection. ZZ Top is one of America's best bands and this brilliant cd demonstrates why.As for the newer expanded cd it includes three fair to average live takes on songs herein. They have a somewhat muddy quality to them. Still they can't detract one iota from this album. Also noteworthy is the return to the original mix sans the over-the-top drums which was an inexplicable move akin to New Coke or painting a broad smile on the Mona Lisa.

Disquieting and unique, High Plains Drifter is not your grandfather's western. Eastwood's sophomore directorial effort borrows from many sources and Clint pays his respects to the styles of both Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone for this offbeat western. Part western, part psychological treatise, and all Clint, this is a unique vision of the western that delivers a sharp commentary on fear, guilt, revenge, and greed. The acting is very good with highlights including Geoffrey Lewis as head bad guy Stacey Bridges and Verna Bloom as the lone conscience of the town. Eastwood's Stranger character is a mixed bag of misogyny and righteousness delivered in his trademark laconic style.This movie forces us to confront our own moral ambiguity and is a highlight of the revisionist westerns of the time.The dvd offers little in the way of special features save a trailer, some filmographies, and a brief write-up about the making of the feature.

Ok - most of you can just skip down to the "no" button and trash me before you read on since I'm not bowing down at the altar, but for those of you who do read on, I'll try my best to tell you why it's three stars and not a flat out "But, it's Jimi!" five stars.First, it is not his best studio album. That would be his first. I would put this after Axis: Bold As Love as well. My biggest gripe with this, as with much of the sixties music, is that it is so dated and trippy sounding that it just wears away at you. Buried beneath stoned lyrics about breathing underwater and psychedelic (yech!) trickery is some brilliant guitar work, it's just a shame that you have to wade through the dopey stuff to get to the nugget below. I'll no doubt piss plenty of folks off, but I don't consider Jimi a particularly great songwriter. He had the riffs, no doubt, but his lyrics tended towards the silly sixties b.s. that I truly can't stand. Still, he did put together some beauties and there are some on this album as well.The first four songs are solid, mostly because the first track is short and to the point despite not really being much of a song as much as a lot of effects. The soulful Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland) is sweet and Crosstown Traffic simply rocks, ala Fire and so many of Jimi's most inspired moments when he cuts the crap and just lays down the rock. Voodoo Chile is a slow blues that just simmers like a delicious stew punctuated by Jimi's hummingbird wail that about shatters glass. From there, the next five songs are good, as well, with the only questionable inclusion being Noel's Little Miss Strange. Burning of the Midnight Lamp is very good and the guitar work on Gypsy Eyes and Come On (Let The Good Times Roll) are pure Jimi brilliance.The biggest problem I have with Electric Ladyland begins afterward, on what used to be the third side of the record. Despite a nice guitar melody on 1983, the lyrics, studio/psychedelic silliness, and the whole dated sixties vibe just kills anything else that is contained on these three tracks, and there are some nice guitar moments at the tail end of Moon, Turn the Tides, just to mention one spot. This whole section is little more than self-indulgence and filler, something left for headphone orgasms and acid trips.The fourth section of the recording might be the best with the second half of Rainy Day (called Still Raining, Still Dreaming) kicking it off, followed by the final three strong cuts which culminate in one of Jimi's crowning achievements, Voodoo Child (Slight Return).This is a mixed bag of stuff. I love Jimi Hendrix - at times. But there are reasons I won't just carte blanche this five stars. This album seems to lack direction, as if no one was there to tell him (or no one had the courage) "Hey Jimi...what is that crap?" It was all so groovy and so hip and so trippy, man, that no one bothered to question Jimi's self-indulgence in the peace, love, and grooviness of the times. If you want proof that perhaps even Jimi realized the excesses herein, look at the songs he recorded after this one. Those songs were concise and much more straight ahead lyrically and structurally. There is much to love on this recording but there is also much that I don't care for at all. For this low price, you won't regret the purchase, but I wonder how spectacular this often sprawling document might've been had someone cut away the trippy filler and stuck to the meat.Okay, now you can click "no." Peace, man.

This recording laid it down for Jimi Hendrix and in his short life in the spotlight, he never recorded a better album. I believe that he might have at least given this a run for the money down the road had he lived, but that's all speculation at this point.The hits are here and there is surprisingly no filler. Even though it came out during the zenith of the psychedelic craze, it is far less trippy than Electric Ladyland two years later. The focus of this record is thoroughly blues, r'n'b, and rock based. Even Third Stone From The Sun has enough of a point and vibe to not succumb to the obvious psychedelic theme. The additional tracks mostly lifted from Smash Hits are a nice bonus, especially Red House, one of his greatest songs.This is the definitive Hendrix album and one of the most important rock records because it introduced this phenomenal artist and his shocking and spectacular guitar brilliance which continues to provide inspiration for guitarists today. Without Hedrix, you can write off dozens of famous guitarists to come in his wake who tried to recreate just some of his magic. If there is one necessary Hendrix album (and there are only a few in total), this is it.

If you don't like the Ramones, you don't like rock and roll. I don't know how else to say it. If you are tired, sad, or having trouble getting started in the morning, put this cd in and get going to a better, brighter, more blitzkreig-y kind of day. This was my introduction to the band and still my favorite, although the debut is fantastic as well. It's A Long Way Back, I Just Want To Have Something To Do, I Wanna Be Sedated, the list just goes on and on...all killer stuff. Even though some of the hardcore fans decried the 'ballads,' (let's face it, latter day Aerosmith drivel these ballads ain't - thank God), they are just being purists. Every single song on here is great and that's something very few bands can say about any one of their records.The Ramones took the pop formula and crushed it with Johnny's down strokes and the sneering nasal charm of Joey's impassioned vocals. Honestly, if you don't like this band, I don't value your musical opinion.

How is it possible that so many people are clueless about what a Judd Apatow movie entails? Scores of these reviews condemn this movie for being too crass, offensive, etc., as if they were expecting a Billy Wilder romp instead of a movie made in another century. This is the guy who has given us a wealth of movies which all tap extensively if not exclusively into the lowbrow, locker room, sophomoric comedic vein that is ala mode. Why would you think this offering would be any different?That being said, I found it funny. Yes, the plot line is hard to swallow. The hot tv personality finding love with the unemployed, corpulent, stoner loser simply because they had a drunken night of sex is straight Hollywood fantasy. Still, it isn't unrealistic that beautiful women go for less-than-handsome guys; just ask Ric Ocasek or Billy Joel. What I found most appealing is the deadly accuracy of the marriage between Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's characters, the latter playing main character Alison's (Katherine Heigl) sister. The palpable angst that permeates their relationship is very real and very honest, as anyone who has had a failed marriage can attest, especially one built largely upon the arrival of children. Within the jokes about genitalia et al are some astute points about relationships, kids, acceptance, and maturity.As for the jokes, I am on the fifty side of my mid-forties and I still laugh out loud at many of them, as crude as they may be. I work with a largely twenty-something crowd and I have come to realize that there is a generational change in what is funny, what is socially acceptable, what offends, and what passes for a new morality, if you'll pardon the usage of such a dangerous word. All I can recommend to those who don't find this kind of humor their style; don't watch it! We can argue the sociological, cultural, or moral implications of such a change in morays all day and night, but in the end, you either find it funny or you don't. But please spare the rest of us your whining. At this stage in the game, your "Oh! My virgin ears! I'm so offended" cries are contrived and disingenuous attempts to stab at the heart of a cultural change that you no longer are a part of. Every generation has its day and yours is past. Come to grips with it, go watch I Love Lucy, and stay out of the current release section.

I've been rolling through Fleming's Bond novels recently and have enjoyed them. I've long been a fan of the bare bones pulp fiction novels of James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler, but haven't read much in the detective genre outside of their works. Ian Fleming's writing reminds me of those books, but with the distinction between his dandy and snobbish Bond versus the blue collar bums that populate some of Cain's work or the gritty world of detective Sam Spade. Like the others, Fleming writes with economy yet manages to convey a lot of emotion and insight into the human condition. Additionally, one of the bonuses of the Bond novels is that we get inside Bond's head and see this man as a much more fully developed individual, capable of pain, doubt, fear, and rage - qualities often lacking in the near-cartoonish movie rogue. For my money, Dalton and Craig come closest to Fleming's vision while Moore's Bond is the most reprehensible version.Live and Let Die, the second Fleming offering, has little in common with the campy Roger Moore entry into the Bond movie franchise (although parts of the novel appear in later Bond movies). It's a quick moving and action packed jaunt through America and Jamaica, giving us Fleming's take on the States, and his simmering contempt for America is amusing to those who can take the joke. Unfortunately, his opinion and interpretation of blacks in America is not funny at all, but rather eye-opening and even hard to take at times. One could argue that this was merely the vernacular of the era, but the condescension and sense of superiority that blankets Fleming's narrative speaks of something much deeper.The book keeps your attention and delivers on all Bond expectations despite the racial misgivings, but it also makes it hard for me to recommend. Make your choice. I found mine at the local library and perhaps you can as well and see what you think. 3.5 stars.

This should be a five star collection of the truly best and most valuable of Jimi's recordings, a staggeringly inconsistent canon. It has already been noted that there are glaring omissions from his short career, a mistake that easily drops one star off right away. How can this be the career spanning masterpiece it should be when milestone moments like Woodstock and the Band of Gypsys are left out?Secondly, the inclusions lack the quality and genius that would go along with such a worthy undertaking. Why do we have second-rate versions of songs when the original releases are so vastly superior? Why do we have sub-par live recordings when so many better live versions are available to choose from? I realize that one of the "bonus" features of boxed sets is the fact that "rare" outtakes, demos, and live recordings are unearthed for the rabid fans, but rarely do these gems live up to the hype. Simply put, there is a reason they were never released in the first place. They should stay buried. If a fan feels uncontrollably needy, they could make them available in other forms.The good news is there is plenty to enjoy and, for me, the inclusion of many cuts from the extraordinary lp "In The West" makes this worth the high price. The versions of "Little Wing" and "Red House" from that old 70s lp are unparalled, as is the electrifying take on "Johnny B. Goode." It is pure Hendrix showmanship at its finest.I was so hoping for more when this came out and I have to sadly say that the true value of this pricey set is that it compiles many heretofore unavailable tracks in one set. Unfortunately, there are too many pieces missing and too much filler.

Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies, the cheap ending, the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass, and the negative liberal view of the white man's legacy. All of these are valid points, but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades. One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores. For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, et al, I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance.Furthermore, this movie never claims to be based on facts, so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong. These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries. Somewhere in the middle lies reality.The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world, in a nation, and in a man. Troubled by his own violent past, Captain Algren (Tom Cruise in his limited, grinning, wide-eyed fashion) is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876. The need for Cruise's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself, but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience. The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography, the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own, powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast, an emotional score, and yes, the message, heavy-handed though it is.Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows, be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire, Jesse James or Wyatt Earp, Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it can't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license. Were it not morally reprehensible, they'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis....if they haven't already.There aren't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain. The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep.

The first James Bond movies I remember watching starred Roger Moore, so I literally grew up on his interpretation. As the years have gone by, I can now compare and take a fresh look at just how cheesy, campy, and lazy the Roger Moore Bond movies were. Given the high praise so many have for The Spy Who Loved Me, I had to review for myself to see if there was a Roger Moore James Bond movie that was worthwhile. So, I found it cheap (five bucks) and watched it last night. I'm in agreement with the masses.While there are still some eye-rolling moments, not the least of which are the mega-groovy disco soundtrack and the ludicrous Jaws, the plot is up to snuff, Moore isn't quite the campy clown he would later become (I watched a documentary on the films and Moore admitted that he found his niche on this film), and the villain is from the Blofeld/Goldfinger mold, which makes for a good guy to hate. Barbara Bach is pretty worthless, but let's be honest, the number of good Bond actresses is smaller than Barbara Bach's acting resume, so that doesn't really make too much of a difference.While TSWLM isn't one of the best in the franchise, it's probably Moore's finest turn as 007, and given that he has acted in more than any other actor (discounting Connery's late non-Broccoli entry), that says something. 3.5 stars.Final thoughts: as is the case in other film adaptations of Fleming's novels, this one seems to only maintain the title. Also, this specific version (and all in this Bond dvd collection) has a Mandarin Chinese subtitle option, which is very helpful for my Chinese wife. Given that it's the world's most spoken language, I'm surprised it isn't standard on all dvd releases.

Reading many of these reviews you can't escape the infantile need so many dopes have to stake this movie with their own personal lingering issues about a variety of issues; U.S. foreign policy, the Civil War (or in their vernacular The War for Southern Independence), politically correct thinking and more. For the love of God, just enjoy the movie!This is one of Clint's finer moments and is an irresistable blend of action, character, humor, and glorious Western eye candy. The dvd that I purchased was ten bucks and featured two documentaries about it, the first time I'd ever seen such behind-the-scenes bits about this great movie. A pretty good deal for the price.Avoiding five stars because it is just a bit too long, due largely to the wholly cutting room floor scenes with the dreadful Sondra Locke and the credibility straining manner in which Josey avoids getting shot for the most part, it is still a highly enjoyable ride.If you want to use this as a conduit for your own politics, spare the rest of us your armchair punditry and go start up a blog or start a thread on the Limbaugh website. For those who relish a great action packed Western, rent it, buy it, enjoy it. Clint doesn't get much better than this.

Let me say at the outset that I'm not a big fan of tab. Figuring out songs on your own provides a greater lesson than simply following along with tabs. Besides, there are scores of free tab sites on the web, so if you really need to know how to play a song and can't figure it out on your own or simply don't have the time, get to surfing.That brings me to one of the reasons I subscribe to this magazine - e.g. the absence of pages and pages of song tabs. In addition to the lack of clutter that comes with tab, I also like the buzz section, the album reviews are excellent, the gear stuff gets a bit much, but what else would a guitar playing magazine feature? Most of all, the articles/interviews are better than the others because they don't seem as juvenile. I get the feeling that Guitar One et al are going for the teen player audience (if you need evidence, check out the Top 200 Guitar Albums issue) and, while GP has altered it's look/feel a bit towards that end, they still remain faithful to their roots. They do have transcriptions, but they are generally single page specifics, not scores of newspaper print pages detailing the latest popular songs.GP is the best cross-genre guitar magazine on the market for my buck. It could be better, but in order to appeal to a large market, it's impossible to make everyone completely happy.

Many reviewers slam RS for slipping away from the cutting edge but let's face it, that happened a long, long, long time ago when rock and roll itself stopped being cutting edge. If nothing else, Rolling Stone magazine precisely mirrors rock's co-opting with corporate America. Furthermore, in this day and age there is no shortage of available magazines, blogsites, websites, etc. for one to subscribe if they care to avoid what they perceive as blatant commericialism, so why slag off a magazine that has simply followed the path of the music form that spawned it?I took a long time off from reading it because I too thought that RS has long since ceased to be worthwhile and it wasn't until I decided to browse some issues that I thought I'd give it another try. Since that time, I've dropped nearly all my subscriptions (too much money and not enough time in the day to read them all!!) and I'm glad that RS covers many of those various interest areas for me. I get political coverage that I generally agree with provided you understand their strong left leanings, movie reviews to keep up with what's out, solid music reviews that at least make you aware of who is releasing what, the old stand-by Random Notes, and the interviews. I still enjoy reading about rock performers and since I started back up half a year ago, I've seen enough of the older artists to satisfy my particular interests. Another good thing about it is that I can stay abreast of new acts and keep my own music collection fresh.Yes, there are way too many ads, yes their incessant 'Top Whatever' lists are little more than reasons to get hate mail to print in their letters section, yes it is a corporate rag, yes it sucks at the teat of pop culture way too much, and yes it is too middle of the road to ever satisfy those who seek a bit more cojones in their periodicals, but it is bathroom reading at its best, it keeps me informed, keeps pressure on Washington, and still shines enough light on the dinosaurs I enjoy. When you consider that they practically give the magazine away in subscription form (versus the staggeringly high newsstand rate), it won't be a waste of your money to buy a subscription and give it a chance.

While the decline of James Bond movies may have begun with Diamonds Are Forever, the first of the Roger Moore era, 1973's Live and Let Die was a blast of nitrous oxide in the wrong direction.Where to start? Solitaire's pre-Queen Amidala costumes? Roger Moore's pseudo-suave act; smoking a cigar while parasailing? Come on...at least Mike Myers was doing it purely for fun, the ridiculous CIA agent Rosie (that would be Comically Ineffective Actress)? The unflattering homage to blacksploitation movies? The not one, but TWO death attempts (shark and alligator) that would make Scott Evil and the good folks at Looney Tunes wretch - stepping over the backs of crocodiles? Are you kidding me? Or how about the decidedly un-exotic locales of Harlem, rural Louisiana, and the dirty slums of the Caribbean? Any of those is bad, but combined into one movie it is truly painful to watch at times.Jayne Seymour does her best and is a classic example of the beautiful but problematic Bond woman, but Yaphet Koto is clearly one of the most wooden villains in Bond history and Moore fails on all levels as an effective Bond. It makes one appreciate the job Daniel Craig has done all the more.Live and Let Die is an embarrassment to the Bond franchise and the first in a dreadful series of missteps regarding the Bond entity. It is played for cheesy thrills, campy laughs, and the emasculation of a great cinematic and literary guy, and that's just not cricket, baby.

Coming on the heels of their finest work, Physical Graffiti, this is a largely phoned-in disappointment. Nothing stands out save Nobody's Fault But Mine, and even that is probably two or three minutes too long. With only seven songs, four of them six minutes or more, this is a clear example of the self-indulgence that dogged this band, or Jimmy Page to be more exact. Is there really a need for the nine plus minutes of half-hearted bluesy meandering we get in Tea For One? Additionally, several of the songs sound similar to each other and none of them, not even the opening opus (again, far too long) can compare to the best this band has delivered. Even the circumstances surrounding the recording of the album are no excuse for the uninspired songwriting. Zeppelin heads already own it, but the curious have a half dozen other much better places to start.

This movie was dull. I'm sorry, but it was for me. However, before writing a review I was hesitant to write at all, I read the reviews and realized how uneducated I am in many aspects of film and realized much of what I was blind to in my urgency to have some plot development.I understood the point the movie set out to make, it isn't a deep one. That's part of the whole issue with me...the movie is practically a documentary and moves slowly and methodically towards its stupor awakening surprise ending. The study of China is fascinating to be sure and I get the human side of the story. However, I found myself getting frustrated that so little was happening and that the title character was so maddeningly stubborn. Oddly enough, I dreamt of the movie all night long and was amazed at how it had crept into my subconscious so deeply.On the plus side, the performances are perfect and the travel documentary of China, from the pristine snowy farms to the bustling gray and indifferent city is worth watching.I advise someone to be patient, bring an open mind, and seek out the things you might rarely look for in a movie. In that, you might well enjoy it better than I did.

The End of the Affair was a short and powerful novel that left me with mixed emotions. It never grabbed me as deeply as other novels which deal with similar circumstances, but still there were passages that resonated deeply in me and there is no denying Greene's ability to pull the reader into the narrator's head. There is a melancholy nature to the narrative from the very first sentence as the tormented Bendrix tells his story with an engrossing and empathetic inner monologue. As I read I was reminded of the work of Somerset Maugham. It surprised me that Greene later references Maugham by way of a critic's description of the character Maurice Bendrix's work. Perhaps my appreciation was tainted some because I kept subconsciously comparing the two authors when I should have tried for a bit more objectivity. Alas, it's easier said than done.The story targets the psychological complexities of love and faith. Bendrix confronts the demons of jealousy and doubt, never believing his love is reciprocated, while his partner Sarah wrestles between her faithless yet dispassionate husband and Bendrix, her passive aggressive lover. When God enters the picture, He becomes the cruelest lover and the most enviable rival. For Sarah and Maurice, self-loathing, suspicion, and a crushing sense of predetermined fate linger over their affair. From the opening page you know hatred is involved, but still you want these two to have what seems to be damnably elusive.Greene's writing is often touching and poignant but at times it labors to make a small point or revelation. His understanding of the complexities of faith and love are often astute, even as there are a few occasions where they sound a bit immature. Indeed, had I read this when I was twenty-five years younger, I think it would have had a greater effect because I would've shared the author's tragic premise that life is full of all or nothing choices and identified more strongly with the doomed lovers.The End of the Affair is a thought-provoking, moving, and sad tale of fated love and the struggle we have with God's role in our troubled lives. Perhaps more than that, it's a treatise on the consuming fire of jealousy where no one, not even God, can come between two lovers.

Kung Fu (or Kung Fu Hustle as I understand the title is open to debate) is a terrifically fun movie to watch. The comedy is not quite so prevalent as in Shaolin Soccer and there is a darker side to this movie with more violence, but it is so thoroughly engaging and entertaining that I could watch it over and over and over.Stephen Chow brings the goods; the insane kung fu, the Looney Tunes moments, the hilarious characters, and the warm back story of Chow's character and his childhood introduction to a deaf mute girl, and wraps it up in this non-stop action packed darkly comedic delight.How movies like this go unnoticed while tripe like Rush Hour gets made ad nauseum is a mystery to me, but if you enjoy this genre, you will love this movie. Highly recommended.

About an hour into Farewell my Concubine, I said to myself, "This is not what I thought it would be at all." It was difficult to find reason or purpose, it was hard to watch, it was brutal, and it was sad. For nearly three hours the movie washed over me thusly, later haunting my dreams last night, and now has me trying to make sense of it this morning after.It is all those things I mentioned at the outset and yet, those things are what make it so fascinating and so compelling. This is one of those movies that you can't easily summarize or tell what it's about without reducing it to those simplicities.The movie is very well done in all aspects, perhaps none so effectively as the performance by Leslie Cheung. It is driven forward between his character and the polar adversary portrayed by Gong Li. At the risk of an oversimplification, the strongest element of the movie is the dynamic between these two characters and their relationship to the third part of the love triangle that brings them together.The best recommendation I can give is to watch it for yourself and experience the rare movie that lingers, confounds, moves, and provokes.

This movie falls short of the wide open possibilities for this movie's premise and instead chooses weak sentiment, hackneyed Carrey tricks, and to quote Morgan Freeman's God character, "parlor tricks" to entertain.Bruce Almighty isn't awful it's just so sadly average and I guess one could say that summarizes the career of Jim Carrey as well. Jim Carrey is capable of a lot and yet no director seems able to rein him in (or perhaps it's that Carrey refuses). Furthermore, he needs to stop accepting flimsy screenplays that require him to rescue them with his manic comedic style. The philosophy worked in the first Ace Venture and The Mask and to a degree in Liar, Liar, but it has long since run out of gas.The supporting cast including Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carrell are really wasted here save the oft-mentioned news broadcast scene where Carrell channels Carrey's vocal pyrotechnics to perfection. There doesn't seem to be much chemistry between Aniston and Carrey either and it's hard to feel anything for Bruce since he's a self-centered martyr who never really seems to get it save a near-death experience. If it takes getting run over by a truck to see how selfish you are when given the chance to play God for a while, then why should anyone feel sorry for you?Most disappointing to me was the cheesy sermon delivered at the end. Honestly, who cares? I don't need the kind of schmaltzy morale provided. Things like this are best saved for book markers, bumper stickers, or The Family Circus.Whether Jim Carrey's agent is not doing his job or Carrey simply refuses to take on a job that might call for him to check his stand-up/In Living Color shtick for some genuine depth remains to be determined. All I know is we need more of this kind of tepid fare about as much as Carrey needs a triple shot of espresso.

Priceless (Hors de Prix) is lovely, cute, and funny. It isn't high art, but rather reminds me of the type of weekend afternoon classic movies not made anymore. Thankfully, it didn't rely on lowest common denominator tricks or crude sophomoric jokes to tell the story of two gold-digging lovers who work the French Riviera. While it's true that the characters are manipulative and phony (we're talking about the very rich and the gold-diggers who mutually use each other), as in any romantic movie, a change of heart is due to occur. I enjoyed the uncomplicated relationship between the two leads who comically try to balance their mutual attraction with keeping their marks satisfied. The fact that it takes place in such a lovely setting is icing on top.As I watched this movie, I wondered how I'd rate it if it was made in America. The answer is probably a few stars less, but that's perhaps the bigger point. It worked for me because it was French, thus wasn't dumbed down/American-ized and because, instead of someone like Kate Hudson or Rachel McAdams, I was treated to the gorgeous Audrey Tautou, one of the most charming and beautiful actresses in the world. She and lead actor Gad Elmaleh are so engaging and play off each other so well that I fell immediately under the movie's spell.Pop some corn, cuddle with you partner, and enjoy this tasty little treat.

Last Train Home is a stark, bleak, and unflinching revelation of a film. It is a documentary of one migrant family and the sad realities of life in sweat shop China. Filmed with almost voyeuristic style, it's hard not to want to turn away when you see the eyes of those being filmed glaring back at you as if daring you to look hard at the reality so few even bother to acknowledge.As a parent, it's practically unfathomable to envision the sacrifices made by so many millions of people scrambling for the most basic quality of life. As an American, the movie offers an eye-opening contrast between the country we ignorantly demonize and our own lives of excess and self-indulgence. If this movie doesn't give you pause to consider all the items in your home stamped with Made in China on them, then nothing will and unchecked greed wins. Rah rah.

This movie was a decent if not limited satire about the many rock-docs that have come out over the years, particularly the Ray Charles and Johnny Cash epics. There are some very funny moments and there are some jokes that are flat-out beaten to death through the course of the movie, but all-in-all, it was a fairly amusing and entertaining spoof.John C. Reilly does a good job playing the title character but he has the hard job of carrying the movie. This becomes harder when the movie bogs down in some rather tired moments. As funny of a side man as he is, he simply isn't engaging enough for me to want to watch for the entire length of the movie. Given the large amount of cameos (Jack's White & Black playing Elvis and Paul McCartney, just for starters), you'd think there would be enough assistance in support of Reilly's rather unassuming persona, but alas it's not enough. Furthermore, there are times when the satire could have and should have been pushed more and instead they let up on the gas a bit to the detriment of the laughs that might've been mined from this rich vein. This is a movie that will make you laugh but will also make you wonder how much better it might have been.As far as special features go, the single disc is a bit of a let down. All you have is a choice between the original theatrical release and the longer "director's cut" version and the obligatory comments option.

I don't usually review movies, but the odious nature of this dvd has so moved me that I felt it necessary to throw an advisory out to the general public to avoid this movie, and perhaps inspire people to question how in the world movies like this ever get made.My primary issue with this movie is the awful behavior of the kids in the movie. Brats of unparalleled measure, these kids are sadly typical of the kind of child we often see in movies, tv shows, and even commercials. The all-knowing brash child devils and their hapless parents is a formula that has become standard fare in Hollywood. Since when did children become so smart and parents such fools? As a public school teacher, I can tell you that the attitudes expressed by the children in this movie have spread to children and parents of an entire generation. It isn't a case of the chicken or the egg, I place the blame squarely on Hollywood and its stunningly powerful influence of people. My wife and I both painfully sat through the 95 minutes of hell this movie delivers and actually found ourselves satisfied when the children learn their dad is a big liar. The moment of truth in the movie wherein the viewer is supposed to understand why these hellions are the way they are had the reverse affect for us. We were happy that these horrible characters had finally reaped what they've sown.Reviewers claim that their kids liked it, and perhaps that's the problem. Children in control, parents floundering and having to endure outright cruel and demented behavior, and a feel-good ending...what kid wouldn't like this? Yet, in an era of overly protective attitudes regarding children, we allow this trash into our living rooms and laugh it up with our kids. There isn't a moment of respect, apology, or even the slightest remorse from these brats, and yet, it all works out well in the end. Life lessons? Given the state of children's behavior today and the utter ignorance and excessive tolerance levels of their parents, (been to a restaurant, shopping center, or playground lately?) I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

I am a big fan of Zhang Yimou. His films are gorgeous, evocative, and unforgettable. To Live is such a film. Following a fairly prosaic plot line about a married couple during three decades of huge upheaval in China (1940s-60s), the film manages to wind around you insidiously and you find yourself uncontrollably immersed. Indeed, the plot is merely the delivery method for a much deeper message.Ge You and Gong Li play husband and wife, enduring self-inflicted tragedy after tragedy, yet clinging to the fundamental sanctuary of family, love, and devotion. The backdrop of Chinese history provides a tempting palate for Yimou to expostulate, yet he avoids making a film that focuses on political commentary. He chooses instead to focus on a greater story; no matter how difficult the circumstances, people rely on love and family to heroically struggle onward and survive, as the deceptively simple title implies.It is hard to imagine a more tragic and yet hopeful movie than To Live. It spotlights our humanity in ways that are as uplifting as they are somber. The performances are superb and the starkly beautiful canvas of grays and browns (coupled with the requisite reds) creates a breathtaking tapestry perfectly suited to this bittersweet film. Yimou brilliantly weaves environmental influences with the resonance of human relationships to create a moving and memorable cinematic achievement.

The is the encapsulation of the best of Zeppelin. From the trademark heavy rock of Custard Pie or Sick Again and the bombastic blues of In My Time of Dying to the fresh Middle Eastern influences most notably heard on the stunning Kashmir, and all points in between, this is a remarkable piece of work. What I particularly like about this record is that they take a lot of chances and most of them work incredibly well. They had shown signs of diversity on previous records and it comes to maturity here. The benefits of a band that can take advantage of their hard-won success and truly allow themselves to spread their wings (the Stones with Exile) are evident in songs like Ten Years Gone, In the Light, and Kashmir. The Rover, my favorite Zep song of all time is just one of the many memorable numbers here. If I had to pick one Led Zeppelin album to have, this is it, no questions asked.All of Zeppelin's unpaid blues dues aside (and there are quite a few), Physical Graffiti, with songs full of awesome power, moving beauty, and influences from around the globe that redefined rock and roll, is the only evidence anyone needs to prove Led Zeppelin's rightful place in the top five rock acts of all time.

Thanks to Encore, I get to watch (or more likely, re-watch) horribly excellent movies from by-gone eras, in this case the 80s, THE period for action stupidity, as well as the sub-genre of cop-buddy movies. These masterpieces of Y-chromosome goodness were created for guys without the slightest hint of Fried Green Tomatoes, preferring instead to heave more red meat at us than Fox News. This morning I happily killed ninety minutes or so of my life watching Action Jackson from 1988.The movie is a virtual checklist of the requirements for action movies, from breasts, godawfully hilarious one-liners, slo-mo deaths, heavily synthed up music soundtracks, scenery chewing bad guys, car chases, destroyed buildings, and copious explosions, to martial arts thugs, and the well-earned separate checklist item for Al "Ka-bong" Leong, the ubiquitous Asian henchman for these types of endeavors. If he ain't in it, it ain't worth watching (although a case could be made for the opposite, but that only applies to stuffed shirts and people who enjoyed Steel Magnolias). Action Jackson delivers a steaming mound of all that is good and righteous in the action movie world, and does so with unapologetic relish. It's impossible not to laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of it. I've seen less funny comedies and I say that as a big compliment.Craig T. Nelson is the bad guy, pre born-again Vanity is the smack-addicted singer, mistress, and reluctant tag-along, Sharon Stone manages a small amount of screen time but a shower scene nonetheless, and Carl Weathers drops bad guys and groaningly bad dialogue with equal abandon.Plot? Are you kidding me? If you have to ask, then just skip this one. For those who know better, the testosterone overload awaits.

This is what it has been billed as - a mixed bag of studio-doctored takes, b-side fodder, and early Jagger/Richards writing attempts. It has a wide variety of styles, focusing on poppy sixties sweetness in the beginning to late sixties outtakes from what would be the start of their halcyon days. There are some nuggets of novelty interest to Stones' fans, especially the more heavily produced, chorus rich, and string flavored takes on Out of Time and Heart of Stone. The songs are unusual and in most cases, not particularly good either. Jagger doesn't possess a vocal quality strong enough to be a true pop sensation. His voice is much more menacing and unrefined for the kind of songs Metamorphosis has a plentitude of and we can thank our Sticky Fingers for that.Jiving Sister Fanny sounds like a Goat's Head Soup outtake despite the recording date with Taylor's straight-ahead solos and Jagger's strained performance. Many people enjoy Wyman's Downtown Suzie but I found it precisely the kind of song that belongs on out-takes. Despite a decent chorus, the verses are really quite awful. There are a few songs that aren't bad but nothing that makes me wish it was released on other more successful albums save If You Let Me which could've replaced a song or two on Between the Buttons and helped improve that album. The tracks Family and I'm Going Down come close to being suitable as well but are in need of better lyrics from Jagger and some fine tuning. Given the writing process of the band, my guess is the band gave these songs as much as they felt they could before bailing out on them.It is an interesting insight into what the Stones might have sounded like had they not been so strongly driven by the blues and avoided being just another short-term pop band. On the other hand, I'm grateful as hell that this is a curiosity rather than a calling card.

The Stones heavily-praised first album of the Mick Taylor era (and last of the Brian Jones one) is a great collection of Stones rock. Most of the reviews have spewn heavily upon it, so I'll save mine for the simple truth of beauty that is Monkey Man, Midnight Rambler, Live With Me, and the arguably top five all time Stones number of Gimme Shelter. There is no Stones song I know of that can so make me stop what I'm doing and just LISTEN to that intro and pause in awe. REALLY great stuff. Yeah, Midnight Rambler live on Ya-Yas is pretty intense, but the version here is a bit scarier, so what the hell. The cover of Love In Vain is really great despite the fact that it sounds little like the original, but hey, isn't that what makes a great cover version anyway? It is such a great Stones workout every time you hear it live it just demands to be an integral part of their country blues legacy. The different take on Honky Tonk Women, however fun, isn't as great as the first version. YCAGWYW is pure Stones canon material and Keith's turn on You Got The Silver as well as Mick's lecherous title track are really solid. So I wonder, how is it that Keef manages to make so many of his songs (You Got The Silver, Coming Down Again, All About You, Slipping Away) sound like the way you feel after a dozen or so glasses of scotch? The man is a marvel of human ingenuity, innit he?Anywho, this is great Stones stuff. It isn't all the way to five stars for me, but it is a high point of the Stones storied career. The extra stars were soon to come...

Movies like this make me wonder how the movie system works. In short, how do movies this bad get made, let alone who dredged up the money to pay big named actors like Leary and Hurley to waste their modest talents? For every would-be screenwriter out there putting their heart and soul into their life's work which will never be accepted by any studio, you have this garbage that was probably written by some hack on contract or worse yet, written on the fly by a cadre of various individuals, most of whom disown this with shame.Movies that walk the line between stupid and having a conscience end up failing on both because they refuse to commit to either. The potential in this movie, largely taken on half-way through, is still enormously wasted and trite. Moments that have a threat of clarity are treated with clumsiness and those that try for comedy come off like outtakes from According to Jim or similar awful sitcoms. My only positive is that this was on HBO, so I can recoup my losses every Friday with Bill Maher.Perhaps one could simply look at this crap as being a light-hearted piece and let it go, but that's exactly why I refuse to. Sticking with the movie's premise, I do not forgive those responsible. But then again, my forgiveness isn't what's important. What those responsible for this rubbish require is the absolution of all those with something truly worthwhile that will never be seen because Hollywood is too consumed with releasing worthless projects like Dawg.

I recently watched this for the second time after initially watching it some years ago and was even more impressed the second time around. While the reasons might not interest anyone but me, the fact is, this movie touched me and moved me deeply. For starters, it is a gorgeous film to watch. The seamless integration of live actors into Kahlo's stunning and evocative work is a magical joy to behold and adds even more depth to the artist's brutally candid art. Secondly, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina deliver top notch performances and most impressive may have been Hayek who is on screen nearly the entire time. I can forgive the vanity hiring of Ashley Judd and Edward Norton as their portrayals are less than the aforementioned two, but this is a minor issue. Lastly, regarding the dvd features and what-not, the second disc is mostly behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie whereas the special features on the first disc have lengthy interviews that are illuminating and candid while demonstrating the love Hayek and Taymor have for Kahlo.I am not a Frida Kahlo scholar by any means nor do I wish to convey any knowledge of her art, life, politics, or anything else. I know that I find her paintings to be vivid and mesmerizing and that's enough for me. I am grateful to this movie for giving me an introduction to an artist whose work I have grown fascinated with and I am furthermore glad that I have a little knowledge, albeit Hollywoodized, of this remarkable human being. My interest has been piqued by this sumptuous love letter to Frida and I will continue to enjoy this movie and my exploration of her work and her life. I hope you find a similar experience.

Considering that the majority of reviews are 1 star, one would think this was "Are We There Yet?" or "Cat in the Hat" (the Mike Myers version) awful. Please people. I realize that movie goers have come to expect brilliance from the Coen brothers at every turn, but this is far from the wretched mess so many people claim.It reminds me of the movies from years long past that were simply charming, cute, and easy to digest. Add the sharp wit, predictable slapstick, and fondness for romantic sentiment of this filmmaking team and you have a better than average comedy with fine acting from all present, especially the main pair of Zeta-Jones and Clooney. If this movie were sixty years old and starred Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, you'd have few complaints.While it might be hard to do, try to watch this movie and not think about who made it and maybe you'll enjoy it more if you approach it with much lower expectations.One dvd note: the version I have did not have the issue of forced preview screenings. I went straight to the main menu and watched the movie without previews. Additionally, the outtakes are odd and largely a waste of time, unless you wish to watch Paul Adelstein deliver the line, "Everybody eats berries" about twenty times and/or watch a loop of old railroad film footage.

At first I thought the dizzying effects were a poor download from Amazon and then I realized they were the vision of the director. While this settles a bit after a half hour or so, the movie never found any footing and really disappointed me.Where to start? First, the characters are all hard to like and worse yet, they are ridiculous clich&eacute;s. Jeremy Irons' John is a bitter and cruel man who does not deserve anything but his self-inflicted lonely circumstances. What he does to Jean is downright heartless and his drunken attempts to divulge the background of Vivian deserved a beating. Then we have his callous disconnect with his wife and family. I'm supposed to feel something for this woeful self-absorbed fool?Next up is Gong Li (who truly needs to find a better agent when it comes to English-language movies - Miami Vice? Hannibal Rising? This?) playing a wretched clich&eacute; of the China doll prostitute. What does she want? What's her story? So many questions that needed answers and I'm given only superficial explanations and disjointed actions. What a waste of one of the finest working actresses in film.Lastly, we have Maggie Cheung as the deranged street hustler who so captivates John that he goes full stalker on her. What could be her story? It has to be something mysterious and fascinating, right? Wrong again. Yet another waste of talent and character development potential.These three hollow characters are thus left to try and prop up a weak story full of trite representations and analogies of Hong Kong's change from British rule to Chinese rule. Sure, it's full of great potential but this mess of a movie does it no justice and neither does it do China any justice, either.The more English language movies I see that attempt to tell Chinese history, the more I crave the movies of Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, and others who spare us the jaded western anti-heroes, the pathetic eastern stereotypes, and the Geraldo-esque pseudo-exposes of the underbelly of a country that deserves far better than Chinese Box. That a Hong Kong native made this is even more confounding.

This might be a five-star Keith Richards' solo effort, but it is not a classic album by any means. What this album seems to miss most of all is Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts. Many folks believe that the absence of Jagger is a positive but I totally disagree. The Rolling Stones were a band, not the Keef project. As much as I believe that a strong case can be made for Richards' as the most influential guitarist in all of rock, in order for the Stones to be the greatest rock and roll band ever, they needed the unique jazzy chops of Watts and the inimitable Mick Jagger. It's naive to think that Keith wrote all the music and Jagger merely came up with lyrics. For anyone who knows a little history, even Keith admits that he didn't provide the music for all the hits (nor, for that matter, did Jagger write all the words).That being said, this is a highly enjoyable album with a very loose, funky, vibe to accompany the expected riff and roll that comes from Richards. An entire recording with Keith's vocals, however, only shows one way in which Jagger is missed. Additionally, there isn't much of interest lyrically. The strongest lyrics are those that speak of the fractured relationship the Glimmer Twins had at this point and they are typical Keith - blunt and to the point.Don't delude yourself into thinking that this is the lost Stones classic so many have been pining for - it is not. It is a fun party record that will move your body and bring a smile to your face.

A Very Long Engagement caught my eye because it was the work of a gifted director and actress who teamed up for one of my favorite movies of all time, Am&eacute;lie. I hoped for the same kind of breathtaking visual feast and empathetic story. I was not disappointed.While Engagement is decidedly graver, it nonetheless has its charm and thanks to the remarkable Audrey Tautou, the driving character in the movie captured my interest and carried me through this densely woven and mysterious plot. Tautou is a treasure as the main character Mathilde, a young girl obsessed with getting to the truth behind her young lover's disappearance while fighting in WWI. The characterizations of this girl are brilliant and it is impossible not to be taken in by her methods of determining fate. Foolishly, I thought I was the only one who did such things...Filmed in sepia tones and loaded with gorgeous reproductions of WWI era France, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet lays out a fascinating tale of the enduring power of love and the dream smothering finality of war. He avoids overt anti-war lecturing in favor of the matter-of-fact starkness of ordinary people put in extraordinary circumstances. Films that deal with war are best when they avoid heroic clich&eacute;s or preachy sentiments, opting for the commonality of human reaction. A Very Long Engagement is such a film.

I bought this book after re-watching the movie taken largely from this exhaustive biography. As someone who has read many bios, let me say that this is a refreshing and encouraging alternative to the fawning and excessive grocery store drivel and/or the dull and fact-filled dissertations that describe most biographies. Hayden Herrera manages to combine a staggeringly comprehensive detailing of Kahlo's life with an easy prose that makes for an engaging read. I know far more about this artist than I could've imagined and it is largely first-hand accounts either from the pages of Frida's own diaries and numerous letters or the people who were there. Herrera keeps her personal opinions regarding the events to a minimum and allows the events to speak for themselves. The life of Frida Kahlo needs no additional padding or maudlin tricks to engender a connection to anyone with a heart and soul. When the author does speculate, it comes from someone who has clearly studied her subject thoroughly and backs up her theories with a wealth of compelling evidence and sensible arguments. While her appreciation for Kahlo is obvious, Herrera does not stop short of being critical, questioning Kahlo's motives, and revealing the stark humanity and insecurity that Kahlo tried to obscure with her public persona as the confident, outspoken, provocative enchantress sporting her exotic Tehuana finery.However, the best use of Herrera's research and the clear compassion and empathy she has for this incredible woman is when she analizes Frida's paintings. I found myself continuously turning back and forth from the detailed observations and interpretation to the paintings and trying to understand what the author is talking about. It was fascinating reading and a wonderful exploration that shed light into the depths of Frida's intensely personal art.Two last notes: First, the version I bought does not sport Salma Hayek on the cover but instead one of Frida's many self-portraits. Apparently the publishers corrected this unfortunate decision based on movie marketing. Second, I was fortunate enough to take in the amazing exhibit of Frida Kahlo at the Philadelphia Museum just a few weeks ago and it was a moving and special day. Seeing the actual frames dripping blood, the size and grandeur of some of the works juxtaposed with the smaller works, and the sheer emotionally gravity of her art was something I'll never forget. Having read much of this biography by that time, I was able to bring that much more to that exhilarating opportunity.Frida Kahlo was not just an extraordinary artist but was moreover an extraordinary person. Herrera's heartfelt, deeply researched, and brilliantly written biography allows those of us who never knew her to feel as if we have and to share in the universal quality of her painful work. That alone makes us better people for having experienced it.

There is another Japanese issue of this album/cd that I picked up recently that has a variation on the track listing as well as those numbers actually on the album. Interestingly enough, not all of the original tracks listed on the cover of the cd are included. Missing are: Smokestack Lighting, Respectable, and Here 'Tis, yet Steeled Blues, Shapes of Things, New York City Blues, Questa Volta, Paff...Bum, What Do You Want, Jeff's Blues, Someone to Love (Parts 1 & 2), For RSG, Like Jimmy Reed Again, Chris' Number, Pounds and Stomps, Stroll On, and a more Indian-style version of Heart of Soul can be found among the 22 songs on the version I own. So, for those of you looking for particular numbers, I'd check with Amazon to see if their Japanese import is like the one I just bought in Japan.All of that aside, it's a rocking album full of Jeff Beck's riffs and stings and the majority of tracks are classic Beck-era Yardbirds. Saddest song not here is the later Over Under Sideways Down, but then again, it wasn't recorded yet. Were it included, this would be more like a Jeff Beck's Yardbirds Greatest Hits. Regardless, things of note, the descending rapid-fire pull off lick in Evil Hearted You - a Beck trademark if there ever was one, the many instrumentals especially Jeff's Blues which borrows heavily from Howlin' Wolf's Highway 49, and the highly learnable yet still vital for nascent guitarists take on Train Kept A-Rollin,' infinitely more subtle and fun than the Aerosmith version.This may not be a musical masterpiece but it is a crucial link in the chain from blues to hard rock and beyond and is an invaluable primer for any would-be rock and roll guitarist.

Most critics argue that Cars 2 lacks the gravitas (someone else's word, not mine) of previous efforts. While I think that going into a cartoon expecting a deeply moving experience is silly for an adult, I'll grant that Pixar injects some sentiment into their movies, but it's often a tad cloying. As for the original Cars, what was the big teary epiphany? That you need to take a break from the rat race and smell the desert roses once in a while? That you shouldn't judge people too harshly at first? Are these serious lessons any more so than the one from Cars 2 that dealt with being yourself? I don't think so. They're both fortune cookie fodder. The reason I enjoy Pixar movies is because they're entertaining, funny, and visually appealing. The harder you try to focus on some larger commentary, the less I like the movie (I'm thinking of Up and Toy Story 3 at this point). You're making a cartoon. Stick with the entertainment and spare me the maudlin manipulation. Although it can be argued that Cars 2 tries too hard to make a point about alternative fuels, how in the world is this bad unless you are affiliated with a major oil corporation?As for the fact that most of the original cast is marginalized, I applaud taking the concept in a totally different direction. Most sequels fail because they try to replicate the original movie. In Cars 2, they left it all behind and went on a global espionage thrill-ride packed with new characters and plenty of wink-wink nods to foreign culture, spy movies, and the Pixar cannon. It's the most action-packed Pixar movie since The Incredibles and since the sequel to that movie -the best one in Pixar's history - is stalled, I'll take what I can get.While Cars 2 is not going to end up on my shelf because it's too long, has too many annoying self-references (including the aforementioned Incredibles and a pathetic one for director John Lasseter), and the grating Larry the Cable Guy has far too big a role, at least I don't feel like I wasted my time with it like I did with both Toy Story 3 and Up.

Seeing colossal blues hero Robert Johnson on the cover of Elijah Wald's "Escaping the Delta" made me pause with doubt because what I certainly was not in the market for was another feverish bio of Robert Johnson that focused on the mystical to the exclusion of all else. Most pleasantly, this is definitely not the case with this interesting and readable work.The book starts slowly as author Wald consumes nearly seventy pages with an exhaustive history of the pop music scene of the Delta region of the American South. Chronicling juke box lists, the careers of artists both well-known and obscure, and emphasizing his thesis over and over again, Wald lays thorough groundwork for the chapters that follow. Once you get rolling, however, the book is a pleasurable read and we get a complete overview of the ingredients that went into the blues, its curious nurturing process, the artists themselves, and the fruits that grew from the seeds of these musical pioneers. We even get a track-by-track analysis of the songs Johnson recorded, a canon of work that has possibly influenced more people than any other body of work in rock and blues history.Wald's purpose is to shine a light onto the real world of working musicians during the early part of the century and show that the invention of the blues was not what you might have been told. Seminal artists like Ma Rainey, Charley Patton, Son House, and, yes, even Robert Johnson did indeed play the blues, but they also played lots of other music from Bing Crosby to Broadway and even hillbilly songs. The musicians of this era were simply trying to get paid as working musicians, which meant playing what the people wanted to hear. Then, as now, popular music was rarely genre specific, it need only be catchy, danceable, and innocuous. Say what you will about Robert Johnson's work, it is certainly not often described using any of those adjectives and the earthier, acoustic blues Johnson is known for has never had a huge pop music audience, then or now. The author devotes much of his time to pounding this point home, but it's a worthwhile endeavor if you care to see the reality instead of the fantasy.Wald's knowledge of the artists and songs and his dogged devotion to cutting through the baloney and getting to the facts within the folktales is fresh and largely free of hyperbole. There are plenty of revelations in the book, for instance: I had no knowledge of the true roots of hillbilly music and how popular this music form was among blacks or how white executives suppressed it for the purposes of segregation. Also, we are given a unique behind-the-scenes peek into the milieu of the musicians commonly referred to as blues artists during the early part of the 20th century. It is both fascinating and informational reading for me because Wald demystifies the clich&eacute;d image of the tormented blues singer, schooled by Satan, and destined for a life of misery that matched their lyrical tales, myths spread by the single-minded agendas of the record company men who were trying to market a product. The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, and scores of others, who were influenced by these artists and their live hard, die young reputation, particularly the infamous Mr. Johnson, helped perpetuate these exaggerations to their fans and thus we have the distortions Wald sought to correct.You don't have to be a fan of the blues to appreciate the breadth of research and myth-busting that is achieved here. Elijah Wald has put a great deal of research into this book and augmented it with the words of those who were there, living and playing the blues (along with all the other genres of music their audiences wanted to hear). I have read some of the reviews and the angry ones seem to be from fans that have had their romantic world of lonesome crossroads in the middle of the night, tortured souls howling at the moon, and deals with the devil put through the shredder of reality. While that's a lot of hard luck for them; it's good news for those of us who'd rather get the straight dope than the well-worn fairy tales. I believe any fan of popular music will enjoy it and take away a much more informed mind about an art form and an artist long on superstitions, folktales, and legends but woefully short on facts and candor.

I was surprised at how many folks hate this movie and the concert recording therein. Many of the complaints are about the sub-par show. I disagree. Maybe it's because I don't think the show is that bad. I enjoy the soundtrack a lot. In fact, the version of many of the songs are more enjoyable than the originals for me, especially (gasp) Stairway to Heaven.The footage is grade A cheese, but so what? Is there no value in Jimmy Page and his devilishy horrible glowing red eyes or the bizarre mafia sequence or John Paul Jones scaring the crap out of his kids? As a special kick for Pittsburgh folk like myself, the opening sequence of the arrival at the airport and the supposed drive to the MSG show was actually footage from Pittsburgh and not NYC, so that always got a rousing cheer from us stoners at the Stanley Theater midnight showings.This is a classic bit of raw rock and roll. It isn't studio wizardry, especially welcome coming from master producer and reknowned anal retentive control freak Jimmy Page. I still enjoy the charm of this movie despite the flaws. Live music is about more than perfection. Perhaps it is the perceived smudge on the shiny veneer of the Zeppelin image that many of the fans have. For me, it just makes the band that much more appealing. Carry me back, indeed.

The Rolling Stones are very press savvy and have been for most of their career. Jagger especially, has always been good at managing his public persona and giving the media titillation rather than depth. Even co-joined twin Keef often remarks in interviews that Mick is a very guarded and calculating guy, even to those close to him. Keith himself is another master of the machine and has helped build his reputation as much on his well-documented brushes with the law and pushing the boundaries of self-inflicted abuse as on his manipulation of the media. So then, Stanley Booth is given the opportunity to hang out with the band on their 1969 American tour and we are given what Booth got; an insider's view of the band, albeit with all the distance, control, and double-talk that Jagger, Richards, Watts, et al have mastered over the years. Many have complained that this book doesn't offer enough exploration of the mechanisms that make these gentlemen tick, but that's the point. No writer can. The closest chance we have had is when Bill Wyman wrote his autobiography, but he cleverly (did these guys sign some blood-contract to not kiss and tell?) avoided gossip and back-stabbing and stuck, rather painstakingly, to just the facts. The bottom line is that a book about the Stones that will reveal what has heretofore been kept closely guarded is unlikely. Keith's upcoming autobiography will doubtlessly be full of his own increasingly inflated tales, much to Richards' delight as yet another book will emerge, chock-full of his tongue-in-cheek mischief and misdirection.Wisely then, Booth decides to write about what he does know - his own history that took place when he was with the Stones, and that is what makes this book so unique. It isn't a fawning piece of hero worship nor is it a nasty tell-all. The author delves largely into his mission to write the book and co-joins the difficulties therein with the tour itself, which needs no additional embellishments since the drama coming out of that tour is legendary. The simultaneous back-story of Brian Jones that arcs above the tour's increasing chaos is brilliantly done so that the two paths tragically meet and we are left with a thoughtful analysis of what has made and will continue to make the Rolling Stones the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. Booth is a fan of the band and we get his excitement about the shows and the adrenalin rush that surely buzzed through the band and out to all who were close enough to the maelstrom. Conversely, we also get the reality of the day-to-day drudgery and business that revealed that life on the road isn't all spotlights and ovations. To repeat, you get what Stanley Booth got; the view from someone on the wings who witnessed first-hand a historic tour and one of the highpoints in the long history of this band. My only wish is that Booth, or someone like him, could've done the same thing with the 1972 tour. Alas, by that time, already wiser and scarred from Altamont and the subsequent and well-deserved fall-out, the band cocooned itself even more and the one book that did emerge (STP) was less sympathetic and more cynical, just like the band had become.In this genre, overflowing with garbage and uninspiring vanity pieces, Stanley Booth's book stands out for its honesty and professionalism. While I admit that I have only read a handful, it is still the best one I've ever read of not only the band, but rock and roll in general.

This is my favorite of the Doors' catalog. It is stripped bare of the pretention Jimbo was infamous for, the psychedelic crud, and the poppy banality of their previous releases. Their debut, while one of the best debuts of any rock group, still maintained one of my least favorite songs in their canon, the oft-hailed but unendingly dull and pompous "The End." I'm sure the cursors are furiously searching for the "no" button at the bottom of this review, but I find that "opus" to be sophomoric and indicative of the worst Morrison brought out from his notebook meanderings. Thankfully, Morrison Hotel has none of that. Jim keeps the non-sequitors and "Hey! Listen to me! I studied philosophy!" references in control and writes more straight-forward and purposefully than before. Perhaps he realized that his utopian vision of changing the world had dissipated like the smoke from so many joints in the audience he dared to manipulate and who, in the end, ignored his attempts at social experimentation and instead cried out for "Light My Fire." Whatever the reason, it's to our advantage that Morrison Hotel finds Jimbo focusing on simply being a member of a very good band. To that end, the vastly underrated guitar work of Robbie Krieger is the musical focus of this work, from the galloping intro of Roadhouse Blues to the trebly riff which closes out Maggie McGill, this album is a Krieger showcase. He demonstrates his unique finger-picking style, slide chops, and genre virtuosity throughout this powerful album. The FM staples "Peace Frog" and the aforementioned "Roadhouse Blues" are masterworks for both the guitarist and the band.In fact, one of the best things about Morrison Hotel is that it is the best recording of the Doors as a band, per se, opposed to a combo backing an erratic poet. Even the inside photo, one of the coolest ever of these guys, is a balanced shot of the foursome, instead of the more common ones with Jim front and center and the other three taking up space in the background. Morrison Hotel is a rocking, bluesy, and bare-bones piece of American rock and roll that stands as the most concise and cohesive highlight in the brief history of this influential band.

When I was a younger guy, worshipping at the temple of Aerosmith and Joe Perry, hungrily devouring every little snippet of info about them, I would always come across Perry's idoltry of Jeff Beck and how influential Beck and the Yardbirds (among others obviously) were to his sound and devotion to music. Like any good history student, I did some research and came across a double lp of this album and the follow-up Beck-Ola. It didn't take long to figure out what all the fuss was about.This is a Beck tour de force from the simple elegance of Greensleeves to the galloping intensity of Beck's Bolero, the sheer sickness of You Shook Me, and the blues workouts on Blues De Luxe, Let Me Love You, Rock My Plimsoul, and I Ain't Superstitious, this is a lethal collection of Beck's genius and guitar mastery. The bonus edition was worth replacing my old cd with because of the rarity of Beck outtakes and the frank commentary provided by the man himself in the liner notes. I know some have slagged it off, but I really enjoy the cheesy Love is Blue most of all!The man is one of a handful of guitarists from the rock world to have influenced guitarists across the genres and his refusal to go quietly into that good night of laurel resting, blues retreading, or commercial banality, proves more and more that Jeff Beck remains as fresh and vital as he did in his groundbreaking days over four decades ago. If you really want to know why this guy is (or should be) mentioned in the same breath as Jimi Hendrix, give this a listen. Thanks for the tip, Joe Perry.

Let me say from the start that this is my first experience with T-Bone Walker so this price is just about as good as it gets for a brand new disc regardless of the artist. I thought I had a pretty good handle on the blues and then I heard this guy. Talk about jaw dropping...wow. This is smooth, silky, laid back blues from a master of the genre. T-Bone's blues comes across in a more subtle and easy going fashion and I found it to be unbelievable pleasant to listen to. I can't accurately speak of this in comparison to other cds from this guitarist, but I can say that for this price, even if you would categorize yourself as a casual blues fan, this is a bargain you simply can not pass up. Put it on, sit on the front porch, sip your beverage, and enjoy! Quite honestly, one of the best blues cds I've ever heard.

Along with the two follow-ups, this is the best Aerosmith there is! This is a powerful document of blues-influenced hard rock, the kind of music Aerosmith helped set the standard for. Surprisingly accomplished for being only their second album, this is chock full of good songwriting, heavy melodies, and the masterful guitar work of Perry and Whitford.There are absolutely no clunkers here and things don't really even settle down but for the melancholy Seasons of Wither, and it is one of their best slow songs. The bitchin' Woman of the World is pure Perry delight and the classic rock staples like the stinging funk of Same Old Song and Dance and the homage with a little extra of Train Kept A Rollin' demonstrate that this band not only recognized its influences but was more than willing to pass the torch to a new generation of rock disciples.The only real difference between Get Your Wings and the next two albums is the production values; the more money the band made, the better sounding the albums became. Still, the songs are top notch and the band sounds as tight and white-hot as they ever were at the height of their reign during the latter half of the decade. Get Your Wings is essential Aerosmith.

Along with it's predecessor Truth, this is the one-two punch of blues butt kicking that Jeff Beck unleashed on the world in the days before Led Zeppelin exploded globally and buried rock and blues in an avalance of heavy-handed overkill. This new release with the excellent inclusion of Sweet Little Angel is worth the replacement of your oldie, especially at the budget price. It's pretty much the same format as Truth, e.g. blues covers and what not, but there is great original stuff in Plyth and Rice Pudding (check out the riff stolen by Hendrix for In From the Storm) as well as some fun and grooving covers of stuff made famous by Elvis. The liner notes again have some good Beck wit and guitarists will find plenty of coursework to learn and master.So many "experts" are quick to mention Stevie Ray, Clapton, Page, Van Halen, and Jimi as the big guitar gods, but if this guy isn't one of the first names out of your mouth, then you really don't know what you're talking about.

The latest and (hopefully) last of the Pirates movies, this long and literally explosive movie is so stuffed with pyrotechnics that you don't have time to catch your breath let alone try to figure out what the heck if going on and why so many plot lines are left blowing in the wind. This is a kitchen sink type of movie where everything from the previous two movies, whether it worked or not, is tossed in with extra explosions and fanfare. Even at nearly three hours, with all the special effects and high dollar visual treats, there just isn't enough time to squeeze in a decent plot. Then again, we are talking about a movie based on a ride in a themepark and not Hitchcock. Everyone delivers well except the relatively bland Orlando Bloom and I'm surprised the scenery wasn't chocolate flavored as it is chewed with such relish by Depp, Rush, Yun-Fat, Nighy, Knightley, et al.Pirates 3 is the prototypical summer movie; it is entertaining, mindless, and fun - just like the amusement park from whence it came. Think of it this way: at this length, you'd have had to float around the Disneyland lagoon at least twenty times to get the equivalent money's worth, and that's a lot of Fast Passes.

I enjoyed this movie a good bit. It is visually stunning, the music is haunting and memorable, the pacing is smooth, and the acting is well done, particularly the character of Hatsumomo as portrayed by Gong Li. She actually brought a sympathetic element to the rather one-dimensional evil geisha in the novel.Much has been made of the casting choices and the liberties taken by the author from his source material. I have read the arguments those opposed to both the book and movie have, but I find they are not powerful enough to distract me from recommending this well done movie. It is a refreshing escapist pleasure.There are many special features covering the world of the geisha and the arduous preparation the actresses went through that are worth watching as well.

This is a nice sampler of the early Heart years before they became MTV heroines and went into a more blatantly pop and keyboard saturated phase. I'm biased towards these earlier works so I recommend this package of hits opposed to the more career spanning ones. Heart is a multi-faceted band whose greatest hits don't tell the whole story. What this album lacks are many of the folkier songs from Heart but what it has are plenty of the heavier songs that the casual fan will certainly recognize. The songs on here are all very good, especially Barracuda, one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. Even now, over thirty years later, that song NEVER gets old to me. It is a superficial compilation to be sure, but it gives the casual fan what they are seeking. The best greatest hits collections should encourage a deeper exploration of the artist, and if this one draws Heart novices to purchase Dreamboat Annie or Little Queen and they discover the hidden treasures that Heart has to offer, then it has done its job. A great place to start.

This is the best glimpse I can think of for what Jimi Hendrix might've evolved into, at least during the early 70s. Like Jeff Beck, the only rock guitarist of that era to share Jimi's stubborn refusal to be pigeon-holed, Hendrix's future was likely to be an on-going quest to find new musical inspiration. The soul, funk, and rock medley of genres in this live collection of the best of the short-lived Band of Gypsys Fillmore East concerts is a passionate and exciting peek into what would've been a fruitful next stage in his career. For a man whose time in the spotlight was extraordinarily short, the excessive amounts of recorded materials on the market make it difficult to distinguish between the good, the bad, and the ugly. Sadly there is far too much of the latter and far too little of the former. Without Jimi around to scrap the crap, record execs pushed for everything and anything to be dumped on the public, especially as is the case with his most zealous fans, a voracious lot who devour it all and still beg for more.Hendrix, in my opinion, made up in guitar work what he lacked in songwriting, leaving us with a plethora of dated, trippy, groovy, and plain annoying hippie fodder which clouds any point his lyrics were attempting to convey. Although his guitar brilliance may have been enough to overlook the silliness of the lyrical content, it also lent itself to a meandering nature that overtakes some of the material, especially the unauthorized stuff, and much of the live recordings.I'm glad that this cd offers little of those short-comings. While "Power to Love" has some of the aforementioned lyrics, the chorus is good and the riff and rhythym of the song are strong enough to allow you to forget the b.s. about jellyfish having no backbone.Another strong component of this offering is the vocal duties of Buddy Miles, who relieves Jimi of some of the front-man responsibilities and allows him to indulge us with his guitar work. Buddy's well done "Changes" is a highlight of the recording and his scat work in the opening "Who Knows" is jazzy and fresh. "Machine Gun" and "Message of Love" are more well-known songs and are given excellent work-outs here. This is, to my knowledge, the only live recordings of Hendrix that the man himself had a hand in and his choices are sound and don't include sloppy rambling guitar fireworks as do many of the releases elsewhere, even those put out by Experience Hendrix. The songs are long-ish jams, but are still tight enough and focused enough to keep the listener attentive. Extended live songs are a risky business, but as is the case with the Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East record, when done well they are remarkable. This is Hendrix live as it should be, and is the best live materials I've heard of Jimi. The box set, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, has some excellent material as well, particularly those culled from the old "In The West" album, but even that has far too much that doesn't cut it. Band of Gypsys is an excellent piece of work from a man who left far too much potential on the table with his tragic early passing. While the saddest thing about listening to this record is thinking what might have been, it is still a rare chance to listen to a preview of where this transcendent guitarist was going.

This is such an entertaining and fast-moving movie that I have seen in countless times over the years and always have a great time! Thanks in HUGE part to the phenomenal performance of Paul Giamatti, BFL takes a unique idea, some excellent cameo casting (you gotta love Jaleel White with the self-effacing work he does here), and the fairly restrained performance of Frankie Muniz and concocts a funny and well done albeit innocuous little cinematic treat. Muniz could've gone overboard which other young actors succumb to but he stays in check for the most part and allows the rest of cast to do what they do. Again, without Giamatti, this movie is a throw-away, but his performance is delicious and never fails to make me laugh no matter how many times I hear his caustic remarks. He is just so, so good here!Given how awful many movies that focus on kids outsmarting adults often are, this movie takes that dangerous premise and, thanks to building the kids' success on the help of other adults, the movie succeeds.Worth seeing for Giamatti alone, Big Fat Liar is a great time!

My wife and stepdaughter have been using this book daily since coming to America and it has proven immensely useful for all of us. The book is amazingly comprehensive, tackling a variety of scenarios and vocabulary, far beyond what I've seen in other picture dictionaries.It features over 4,000 words covering 241 color pages (with both illustrations and photographs), divided into twelve chapters covering recreation, plants and animals, areas of study, work, transportation, community, health, clothing, food, housing, people, and everyday language. It also has an index at the end with phonetic pronunciations as well as Chinese characters. Clearly, this book will be used until it literally falls apart. At this rate, I'm considering laminating each page and putting it in a three ring binder because it's simply that consistently referenced.As others have noted, this is not a tool for English speakers looking to learn Mandarin Chinese, unless you already know the characters/symbols, as Pinyin is NOT used. If you are looking for an invaluable tool for a speaker of Mandarin Chinese who is learning English however, I can't recommend this book highly enough.

During the summer of 1982, I read the eponymous harrowing story of a teen heroin addict prostitute in Berlin named Christiane F. A while later, I came across the soundtrack album and bought it not knowing much about David Bowie's work at all but relying on the young girl's adoration. It was a perfect soundtrack to the dark themes of the autobiography and fast took on that same role in my life. Few songs captured the angst of that period of my life as perfectly as the haunting "Sense of Doubt."Decades later and living in Japan, I was surprised to come across the cd version of the album and picked it up without hesitation. By that time I had become a Bowie fan, particularly of the Berlin era of his output. Even though I had most of the tracks on this recording, it was worth picking this up for the German-English version of "Heroes/Helden" and the live version of "Station to Station" as well as the new liner notes which detail the story as well as a track-by-track analysis. The version of "Heroes" is still my favorite because the German language seems to give an even greater emotional quality to the lyrics.This soundtrack is an excellent primer for a period in Bowie's history that features some of his most personal and bleak compositions and I will always think fondly of it for leading me to David Bowie.

When I was 20, some several decades ago, I heard that one of my favorite actors, Bill Murray, was putting together a movie based on a book called The Razor's Edge. I had no idea what it was about, but wanting to read the book before seeing the movie, I picked it up and read it. What happened was the first in a chain of events that has led me down paths that have made me who I am now. At 45, I once again read this book and am equally moved and thrilled to realize that life, like a skater's languid figure eight, has come back again to a place it once was. Like that same person with barely two decades of life under his belt: single, without care, drifting in life without purpose, career calling, or direction, my purpose is as uncertain as it was so long ago. So, now what? Well, that remains to be seen.The Razor's Edge is a book that I wish everyone would read at some time in their life, if only to encounter Larry Darrell, one of the most remarkable people in literature and a man to whom each of us should pledge to aspire, if only for a little while. How much better would life be if we were to simply eschew material goods for spiritual discovery or see the grace and glory in doing things for others for the sheer joy of helping out and being the best that we can be? Is there a more important issue to ponder in our lives than what our purpose is and who is the truest and most worthwhile person we can be? This classic novel, easy to read and yet remarkable thoughtful and full of deep human understanding, gives us Larry and lets us judge not only his actions, but our own in contrast. The Razor's Edge is nothing short of my field book for life, a reminder of what I know to be true, right, and decent, and the talisman to keep me on the path towards hope, enlightenment, and being the man I was intended to be.Towards the end of the book, Larry explains, "It's strange how many people suffer from (fear). I don't mean fear of closed spaces and fear of heights, but fear of death and, what's worse, fear of life." I have come to understand that the battle with fear is a part of life. This book, like all of the cherished lessons and experiences in life, is a crucial ally in that on-going engagement.

I know the Farrelly Brothers reputation preceeds them, but this movie takes what they are infamous for and adds some heart and soul and the result is a nice little comic-romantic offering. Jack Black is, well, Jack Black as the title character, which tells you all you need to know. Jason Alexander is, well, Jason Alexander as Hal's buddy and does his George from Seinfeld best portrait in smarminess and manic exasperation. Gwyneth Paltrow is understated as the self-image challenged Rosemary and gets the job done without maudlin overacting. The movie comes with a heavy-handed but well intentioned moral and you come away from this movie with a bit of hope and even possibly a dash of inspiration opposed to just coming away from it with something in your hair or mustard down your throat.

Unfortunately for me, I came to the X party very late. Still, better late than never, right? For me, "Ain't Love Grand?" was my introduction to this remarkable band. I was listening to the college station while at work and they had an in-studio guest in one Exene Cervenka. I'd heard of X through magazines but had never heard them per se. They started off with "What's Wrong With Me?" and I was knocked out. Work was right across the street from a record store and the rest is history.Naturally then, it's hard for me to knock this album too much even as I went back and experienced their back catalog and came to see how this recording would be seen as such a giant disappointment to those who knew X when. The knocks generally fall towards the slick pop-metal production, which is clearly the wrong sound for this band. The liner notes feature the band's in-depth analysis of the situation at the time and it answers a lot of questions about not only why poor choices were made for the group and this album, but also how the industry works and how outsiders can ruin something they know nothing about. A perfect example for this record is the way Exene is mixed down on songs, a crime on a parallel with Loretta Lynn being shoved into the background on a duet with Conway Twitty. John Doe and Exene's vocal dynamic is the very core of what this band is about. That's not to say that they are the best part of the band - the band is too strong in too many areas to make that comment. But, their peculiar back and forth is what allows their heart-wrenching and thought-provoking lyrics, Billy Zoom's machine gun Gene Vincent chops, and D.J.'s propelling drums to alchemize into the brilliance that is the music of X. Sadly, this happens on far too many songs that would've been so much better had the controls been in someone else's hands.The songwriting is predictably good X stuff for the most part, giving us plenty of choice songs to get you from point A to B, it's just a freaking shame that the production took their beautiful ideas and pigeon-holed them into pop-metal schlock sound. Don't get misled that this album sucks. The production is wrong, but the songs are still generally great, and gems like the throbbing classic "Burning House of Love," the angry anthem "What's Wrong With Me," Doe's lament "Around My Heart," and the Cervenka spotlight "My Goodness" are worth the price of admission to these unfortunately misplayed odes to a broken marriage.

Yeah, I know it's a movie that could be easily torn to shreds but the previews were enough to spark my interest and so I saw it on a lark with some friends at a discount showing and we were all three laughing throughout. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke; I saw it again just now on dvd and it was still funny.Look, I fully understand that the world needs another movie that celebrates the stupid like we need another religion, but for whatever reason, this movie made me laugh and I had a great time.The in-jokes are rampant, all the way down to the Karate Kid reference topped by a cameo from the villain from said series. There is an excess of pointless nudity, f-bombs galore, and a plot as thin as the lines of coke drawn on the mirror in the many drug scenes. Even though this is not a movie you watch to point out the flaws, the 80s version of me demands I point one out: the total cognizance of John Cusack an hour or so after downing `shrooms, coke, pot, and a ton of booze. Somehow he is still John Cusack, i.e. a dronish bore of an actor with a very limited emotional range. To those who claim his career has taken a down slide, I have to ask from where? He's never been that great but he does seem to be fairly ubiquitous, so someone likes to see him in movies. Then again, he plays the same character he always plays - the self-obsessed navel-gazer - so maybe that's the joke. Fortunately he doesn't have to carry the movie. That task is handled joyfully by Rob Corddry, the man who makes this movie work.If you are easily offended and/or don't like the content I've outlined, you will hate this movie. If you like raunchy yet wink-wink clever, you'll find this a very good time.

It's hard not to see this as a let down following Desperado and given the additions of some big names, most notably Johnny Depp. However, judged as simply another high action low everything else movie, it isn't that bad. There's lots of explosions, shoot-em up scenes, and some over-the-top squeamishness, but there is enough left-over cool factor from the previous two to make it enjoyable enough. Depp steals the show and in hindsight, I wonder if this was a vehicle made more for him than Banderas, Hayek, or anyone else. His character is compelling to watch as he quirks his way through the convoluted plot and brings a bludgeoningly sardonic element to the otherwise largely two dimensional characters. Hayek is barely present, Mickey Rourke is bland, and Willem Dafoe was simply a bad choice. He does an almost black-face as a Mexican, the make-up so horridly obvious on his fair features. I find it impossible to believe that there were no Latino actors who could've brought equal marquee stature and shored up the woeful lack of credibility brought by Dafoe. Still, Eva Mendes is a nice evil touch and the heart of the movie may just belong to Ruben Blades as the retired FBI agent out to do the right thing.Once again, as in Desperado, there is a boy who plays a small but important role in the movie and adds some humanity to the popcorn carnage.Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a fair part of the trilogy and while it pales in comparison to it's predecessors, standing on its own, it is adequate enough for a good viewing.

There are three Clapton recordings that are most often referred to in the man's staggering legacy of work. John Mayall's Bluebreakers, Derek and the Dominoes, and 461 Ocean Blvd. Let me throw this little treasure in there as well. Only six songs, although extended jams, this document serves as a testament to his blues playing prowess, herein flavored with the spiritual influences of Blind Faith. Not the stunning sting of his work with the bluesbreakers, nor the plaintive desperation of Derek and the Dominoes, and certainly not the freshness and comfort of Ocean Blvd., this record is Clapton tired and sad, as if lying on his death bed, oozing smooth, effortless blues. His laconic yet superb take on "Rambling On My Mind" is my favorite version, and the rest of it is very nice work indeed.

According to the Rolling Stones is an autobiography/memoir of a band by the remaining members, three of whom were in the original incarnation. Their story is told exclusively via interviews that have the guys going back to the beginning of the band and up to the time of the band's fortieth anniversary tour. The boys look through the past not so much darkly as with a sense of innocence and fondness. We're spared much of the dirt and drugs in an attempt to simply convey more of the musical recollections, the who, when, where, and why of certain events, and the oft-conflicting versions of stories that have since become legends (being locked in the kitchen to write their first song tale, auditioning Taylor's replacement, Charlie punching Mick after he was called "my drummer," etc.). If you had a few hours to spend with the four members of the band and listen to their combined story of how they went from fans of American blues, jazz, and pop to the longest running rock and roll success show in the world, this is the document of such a rare conversation. To distill the story of The Rolling Stones is to take all that has been written about them and filter it numerous times to winnow out the fact and distortion from the truth. In order to do that properly, the importance of this book can not be ignored.Much has been made about the absence of any and all former members and others in the Stones circle. Didn't Bill Wyman already pen his autobiography of life in the band? Do you really think Mick Taylor hasn't had a chance to tell his side of things? For my money, he is far and away the most over rated member of the band, anyway. Does anyone really think he had that much to do with their success? Do those of you out there who feel he got a raw deal somehow not remember that he quit the band? How can he be treated unfairly? He was given a golden ticket to ride on the Stones train long after it had already picked up a good head of steam. Taylor was nothing more than the hired gun in an arrangement that never fit the dynamic the band was based on - the oft-referred to weaving of guitars - and he bailed out when he couldn't stand the boredom or take the toll the lifestyle was exacting on him. He's a good blues guitarist who has done little of note since he left the band to pursue other musical avenues. I'm not knocking the guy at all, but I'm totally sick of the heroic status anointed a guy who performed little more than the same duties Darryl Jones now assumes. His fans believe Mick Taylor is the consummate underappreciated figure but it's a distorted view. It's a foolish attempt to deflect the deserved praise Jagger and Richards have earned onto a guy who never fit in the band by his own admittance. In this autobiography, the band members champion his chops but underscore his self-imposed distance from the core as well as verifying what has always stood from the moment Brian Jones' short-sighted and narrow vision of the band was steamrolled by the juggernaut that was the Jagger-Richards collaborative; the Rolling Stones are primarily Mick and Keith's band. It's driven the weaker out of the band (Jones and Taylor) and it discounts the accepted role Ron Wood has achieved. Please people, get over Mick Taylor already.According to the Rolling Stones gives us as honest a history as we'll likely ever get. For one thing, I applaud the fact that this is a band that spares us the back-stabbing trashy tales that prop up duller histories. The mythology of the Stones is legendary and often overshadows their musical accomplishments (did you see the Larry King interview?) For once, we get a story long on the specifics and short on the stanky garbage we've been subjected to far too often.

During the mid to late eighties I was fortunate enough to have one of my dream jobs when I worked in a record store. For that brief moment in my life I was exposed to so much music and a fair amount of it has stayed with me over the decades since that idyllic period. Such is the case with The Lion and the Cobra from Sinead O'Connor. The vocal range of this gifted singer jumps out at you right away on the haunting opening track Jackie. This album is a hypnotic collection of gothic intensity, sultry acoustic strumming, pulsing beats, and angelic whispers of raw emotion.I will admit to not following much of her career after this album beyond the inescapable Prince cover and her highly publicized political statements but I can testify that this album is a timeless and powerful collection of passionate, beautiful, and melodic songs. There aren't that many albums where you love every song and which comes to a close far too quickly. That's what you get here.

You tried with this movie and I really appreciate that. You've made some stinkers and you've made some that had moments but never fully delivered. A Thousand Words is like that, albeit a mixture of your raunchy self with the Daddy Day Care part. It's not a great mix. You've either got to do one or the other. You make a nice but trite point about spirituality and finding inner peace and a whole lot of stuff that your character denounced as New Age garbage at one point, quite correctly, I might add, but it's not enough to elevate yet another pedestrian effort. If you're going to make a movie that touches my heart and has some profundity, go all the way and don't try to Eddie Murphy it up with your shtick because you end up pulling a Bill Murray trying to do The Razor's Edge, and it just doesn't work. I appreciate the effort, but it ends up being another in a really long string of duds. I'm sorry man, but that's the way I feel.You're so talented, Eddie. I mean, seriously. They should've created a special Oscar just for The Nutty Professor so you could've won both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor all-in-one. There is no one in Hollywood who could've pulled those movies off, and that's no lie. But since then....what? Okay, Dreamgirls, but that was a supporting role in a Broadway hit. So, what's going on? Is it you? Are you hard to work with? Is it your agent? Is it that you simply don't care and only want to collect a paycheck? I wish I knew. I wish you knew so you could correct it. In the end, you know I'll watch your next movie because I still believe you have another home run inside of you. Don't give up and don't throw your talent away, Eddie. I'll be cheering for you.Sincerely,A fanP.S.Please pass this letter on to Jim Carrey when you're done. Thanks.

I don't read books twice, at least not often. This is one of the few and the only one if you omit children's books! It is a book that struck deep into my heart and made me re-read passages just to marvel at the prose, the wisdom, and the simple elegance of Edith Wharton's narrative of the human condition. I literally wept as the sad tale of impossible love unfolds. It is a credit to Wharton's writing that her characters press onward and take their defeat with grace and class, therein making this bittersweet novel more honest, both intellectually as well as romantically.I can not say that you will like this, although if you have read Ethan Frome, you will be familiar with the gift Wharton has for skipping the sugar-coating and allowing the reader some credit. This is one of only a handful of novels that have moved me on a deep level. That may not mean much to you, but it means a lot to me.

I have generally enjoyed the mindless movies of Judd Apatow, but Step Brothers is simply horrible and nearly unwatchable. It reminds me of a bad SNL routine, those ones that simply linger on and on and on without merciless end. The kind The Simpsons skewered when Krusty was the guest host and they did the Giant Ear Family, "Ugh! And this goes on for another seventeen minutes!"My dislike has nothing at all to do with the crudeness, the excessive swearing, or even the nut sack on the drum kit component. But unless those things are in the context of a movie with likeable characters, a decent plot, and WAY less annoyance, the overload only works as exacerbation and not amusement. The only two characters who weren't completely loathsome were the two main female roles, played by Mary Steenburgen as Brennan's mother, and Kathryn Hahn as the sister-in-law to that same character. Steenburgen almost pulls off the mother who can't see the destruction in her enabling over-protection and Hahn steals the show as the self-hating, ego punching bag for her horrible husband and their devil children.One of the reviewers said that he forced his wife and sister to watch the whole movie with him just to see if it got better. Two of my kids, both teens, watched it with me and were equally tortured and begging me to terminate the relentless stupidity. As I watched this I keep thinking that it was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen because it made no sense, wasn't funny, and seemed more like a shotgun approach to movie making than anything remotely resembling a fully developed idea. Throw in the completely predictable, and in this case, wildly unhelpful Apatow locker room humor, and you have a bizarre and painful exercise in movie watching. You'd think that with the amount of money being made, they'd try a bit harder. I hope it is simple laziness and not a demonstration of contempt for the audience. I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes next from this clearly self-satisfied group.One thing that I will recommend is the gag reel, which had us laughing until we had tears in our eyes. Sad that the gag reel is far and away the best thing about a movie. On the other hand, it demonstrates that these movies are mostly improvisational exercises and that the screenwriting credits are based solely on who said what in the free-form shoot.Watch this only if you want to test your own ability to withstand torment. By the time it was over, I felt I'd just finished a marathon of the worst of SNL.

With The Sorcerer's Apprentice Jerry Bruckheimer tries to get Pirates magic with another movie idea devoid of originality and long on product tie-ins and deals made with the devil, er, Disney, and his tried (or should I say tired?) and trusted star attraction Nicolas Cage. Who do these guys think they are - Tim Burton and Johnny Depp?Nicolas Cage is not Johnny Depp for many reasons, but in this movie it's because the idiosyncratic joy of Depp's Captain Jack only exposes Cage's plodding and monotone performance for the lifeless paycheck it is. As Balthazar, an apprentice of Merlin who has been charged with finding the one person who can win the epic battle of good vs. evil, Cage does what he's been doing for decades now - dead panning lines, flashing his wide eyes, and letting us all know how much Botox he uses. I used to like Nicolas Cage back in his Raising Arizona days, but something happened and he's grown into one of the most wooden actors this side of Keanu Reeves.Then you have Jay Baruchel, an actor renowned for his nasally whine best suited for cartoon voiceover than real life roles. In two of the three main roles you have very dull actors, so you're already in trouble. The only actor who brings it is Alfred Molina, but herein he seems wasted and schticking it up more than anything else. It's always easy to play the villain and he's more than capable of injecting some life into the tired character he's given.There are a handful of in-jokes, but these have become tiresome and Disney/Pixar seems to think people just love to scour their movies for them. Here's an idea - how about writing better movies so I don't have to amuse myself with looking for product placement or the homage to older and better movies?This movie was bland and thoroughly predictable, all the way down to the wait-for-the-very-end-of-the-closing-credits sequel teaser, ala all the Pirates movies. These kinds of paint by numbers productions are the norm when Hollywood seeks to put together some summer or holiday blockbuster, but I wish that they would try harder to put some creativity and originality into these projects instead of following their tired formula. Big money is being spent on old tv show retreads, sequels ad nauseum (remember how embarrassing Jaws 3-D was? Nowadays a blockbuster movie just isn't worth its salt unless it can be milked for a minimum of three installments), movies based on toys, and now the movie-izations of Disney amusement park rides and short cartoons. Walt Disney must truly be spinning in his cryogenic chamber.Hey...maybe there's a movie in there somewhere...frozen creative guy is brought back to life to stop the world from the takeover of aliens who disguise themselves as the tea cup ride! Somebody call Jerry Bruckheimer and Shia LeBeouf!

The Hunger is my favorite vampire movie and one of my favorite 80s movies. It has the vibe of that self-indulgent decade all over it and director Tony Scott's first foray into film relies heavily on his commercial background. The shadows moving across the screen, the billowing drapes, the sparse dialogue, the wonderfully evocative musical pieces - Scott's movie screams mood. This works for me while it aggravates others. If you approach this film as if you were seeing an art house film instead of a major production, I think it works best. Even Sarandon, in the commentary, says that she took this role because it was not predictable or safe and felt that it was better to fail trying something a bit out of the ordinary than to walk through something boring and innocuous. To that end, The Hunger is not a failure at all, but rather a successful, unique and luxurious take on the traditional vampire genre. I'd even sub-categorize it is a romance/horror because so much of the film is devoted to the concept of love's questionable endurance and the pain therein. Either way, I'd much rather revel in this fresh approach, even if it is often little more than art for art's sake instead of a clever and engaging plot than the God-awful Coppola version or even the John Hughes-ish smarminess of The Lost Boys et al.The Hunger is a big decadent &eacute;clair; full of sweet sin and beautiful to look at. Take a bite.

Languid, sensual, erotic, breathtaking, thought-provoking, gorgeous. Those are the adjectives that come to mind regarding Ang Lee's luxurious Lust, Caution.According to the negative reviews, this is far too boring, too sexual, not sexual enough, implausible, and painfully too long. It's an art house picture that liberal artsy types feel compelled to favorably review or else risk losing the title to their Prius. No doubt, if you went into this movie expecting a hot-blooded, breakneck-paced pot-boiler, you would be severely disappointed. Knowing Ang Lee, however, I can't see how one would expect that. Like so many of his movies, this movie is beautiful to behold, an emotional feast, and inevitably satisfying to my soul.The plot is secondary to the human insight and so is the much-ballyhooed sex. This is a movie about people and the pain of love. It is a delicious exploration of obsession, lust, love, anger, humiliation, duplicity, and duty. This is the type of movie you commit time and thought to, and there are far too few of them anymore. It is not a movie that clobbers you over the head with explosions and in-your-face ADHD storytelling, but rather a relaxed study of human behavior. If you've got the time and sensibility to devote, I highly recommend Lust, Caution.

The fourth album by Liz Phair, the darling of the indie rock scene when she released her debut ten years prior to this re-invention of sorts, is a nice mix of the old and the new. Yet, many of the critics of this release lament the blatant pop quality of some of the songs that found their way into regular radio airplay as well as movie soundtracks. Let me get something straight; the Beatles have been hailed as the greatest rock band of all time by largely focusing on pop songs and yet Liz Phair is ostracized as a sell-out when she does the same? Factor in the scads of reviewers who can't reconcile or stomach a woman writing a song about semen when the entire history of macho rock and roll has focused on the male perspective of sex and objectified women's bodies and sex far beyond the pale and we have evidence of something more closely resembling latent misogyny or at the very least a double standard rather than an opposition to a cd which has a far more approachable radio-friendly vibe than they were expecting from the pigeon holing they demand of artists."Red Light Fever" is a pointed and emotionally-stirring song, "Why Can't I?" is fun and catchy and the heartbreaking "Little Digger" shows the world through the eyes of a child who carries the confusion and scars of his parents' divorce. These are songs straight from the life of a woman going through divorce, starting to date again, discovering younger lovers, feeling comfortable in her new life, and trying to make sense of it all. Phair has been nothing if not lyrically blunt and she keeps that trademark alive on this cd. The aforementioned "H.W.C." is funny yes, but moreover, in your face and the kind of song we should be thanking her for writing. Stop the over-romanticizing of love and sex and just tell it like it is. I'm glad she avoids the cowardly and sophomoric metaphors everyone from Prince to Kiss to Madonna to Aerosmith and all points in between have used to talk about sex and just talks like an adult. How refreshing. Why does that make so many people uncomfortable? Clearly your discomfort says more about you than her.There are enough songs on here that hearken back to her previous lo-fi releases to satisfy hardcore traditionalists, but it's the proudly poppy songs that keep this cd in heavy rotation for me years after its release.

This movie was what I had hoped for and a lot more; a silly, raunchy, vulgar, and profane bit of Jack Black driven insanity that makes you laugh and laugh hard. The f-bombs drop continuously as if there was a quota that needed to be reached and you end up laughing just at the pure ridiculousness of it all. In addition, the songs are so bloody hilarious that I dare you not to find yourself repeating them, vulgarities and all, as you go about your life in the days to follow. Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters/Nirvana shows up in an excellent cameo as Satan but it's the priceless scene just before that one that really had me howling. It's the little voice that lives inside of you...This is the kind of movie you watch for the pure pig in mud joy of it. I've already rolled in it a half dozen times and have enjoyed every moment.As for the extras, there are fourteen deleted/extended scenes, featurettes, music videos and more.

I give this a three based on the tight performances and the fact that there are NO versions of "Start Me Up," "Brown Sugar," "Jumping Jack Flash," or "Honky Tonk Women."The performances here are solid and I enjoy the updated versions of older material. It's also a nice way to re-acquaint yourself with some good "Bridges to Babylon" numbers.Even if this is little more than a tour souvenir, it's a solid one. Be honest, who really buys these things other than Stones fans? Most likely, the curious are going to be scared off by the omission of the standards, so these things are purely for our ever-growing collections. Is it just more money in their overstuffed coffers? Sure. But if it's done well enough, I'm not going to get bent about it. The Stones are way past the point of arguing about artistic integrity or how rich these guys are. They're an icon, a brand name, and an institution. When they put out good stuff, I'm a happy fan. This is an example.

I realize that there is much that can be ridiculed about The Notebook. The movie practically begs you to find holes. It has the depth of a soap opera. And yet...when I watched it with someone who is so incredibly special to me - the both of us wrapped up in our own personal life miseries, but being great friends and pulling each other through each other's difficulties - and we sat there, quietly sniffing, gently laughing, and shifting in our place next to each other on the couch as the emotional impact of the movie ebbed and flowed, I let the critic go and embraced the moment. At the end, we simply collapsed against each other in tears and the hope that somewhere, sometime, we would find what Allie and Noah had. I loved the movie. I loved watching it, letting my romantic nature gush forward without apology, and I did not care how predictable it was, I did not care how believable it was, I did not care about anything but the fact that true love - the kind of poems, plays, movies, tv shows, novels, and songs from the dawn of man - is so vital and enriches our lives so much that little can compare. In choosing, as many of us will or have already, between practicality and our hearts, the path our heart wants is the best. To the dreamers, the lovers, and the hopeless romantics, enjoy this movie. Watch it with someone special and allow yourself to feel alive. I won't give up my beliefs and I hope you don't either.

Lions for Lambs addresses three areas of our current state of the union. The first is the messianic desire for America being the global and moral police force. Second, the media's morphing from the fourth estate to the fourth branch of government; a complicit enabler of public duping and a whore to ratings and lowest common denominator pandering. Lastly, it delivers a solid punch in the nose to America the Apathetic.While the back and forth between Streep and Cruise plays like all the other left/right debates on any Sunday morning program, the give and take between Redford as a university professor and his increasingly self-centered but once-promising student is well done. Some have complained that Redford lectures, and he does (he is playing a professor...), but his student volleys with equal skill and you hear a debate that is not heard enough; what's the right choice for someone in this land of plenty?America has become so powerful and wealthy that we have people who are poor yet fat, and possess cell phones and flat-screens, thus no desire to change their circumstances. The new "heroes" of our society are business-people or entrepreneurs, those nauseatingly-dubbed "job creators," whose overarching goal is not the betterment of society but rather the fattening of their bank account. Those people are enabled by politicians who are equally self-serving and cynical. Furthermore, we have become so spoiled by our excess that we no longer care to improve (and in some cases, if one tries to improve America, their loyalty is called into question) or even perpetuate this experiment called The United States of America, but rather seek to get ours while we can and to hell with the future. Lions for Lambs might not solve all these problems, but it need only start the dialogue and get people to think about more than themselves. Wouldn't that be a huge step in the right direction? Recommended.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie as the trailers are more lurid than the movie itself. I'm glad I took a chance. To start, the acting is well done from all the players, not just the two main characters portrayed by Jackson and Ricci. The director/writer lets you know that this is a fable and he borrows from the mythology of the deep South and the blues music therein. And of course, there is the music, a brilliant score that drives the emotions of this well-crafted movie by paying homage to the music of some of America's greatest musical heroes.If you like the blues and you like a well-done yet gritty and raw fable, I recommend giving Black Snake Moan a spin.

There is a perfect absence of coincidence between those who hate this book, find the Wheelers entirely unsavory, and believe they are but spoiled people and Yates a boring and jaded critic of America's middle class and the fictional characters in the book who feel the same way (sans the Yates reference). Somehow, somewhere, I think Yates is laughing.I'm afraid that what most people don't "get" about Revolutionary Road is exactly what Yates embodied in the social network that worked to bump, nudge, bribe, and cajole Frank Wheeler back in line with the other 98.9% of society, as John the insane asylum inmate/voice of stark honesty in the story, refers to them. As if incredulous that someone could be so immature, so irresponsible, or so selfish as to think themselves more better than anyone else, they chastise the author for even bringing up the subject. April Wheeler realizes early on that she is nothing special and yet she also understands that following one's dream, taking the road less traveled, or breaking free of conformity need not be some grandiose artistic fantasy. It simply means that you follow your heart and the true voice of who you are instead of giving in to self-doubt, fear, and societal pressure.To be fair, I realize this book is bleak, unsettling, and unsparing in its critique of the banality of life. It questions conventional definitions of sanity as well and shows us the stark reflection of ourselves in society's mirror. What is happiness? What is the difference between settling and living? How powerful are social pressure and the push to conform?This is a timeless, brilliant, literate, thoughtful, powerful, and necessary book that I would rank in the top five books I've ever read. Yates proves a master at dialogue and exposing the frailty of our own ego and self-image. I would recommend it to everyone I know, if only to get their reaction and therein come to discover a little bit more about them than I'd known before. It is a story I feel such a kinship with, to characters who remind me of my own unmet dreams and the difficulty of swimming upstream, and the societal pressure to turn back and settle for a life far below what you know is right. For those who liked the movie, the book is fuller, richer, and more complete in getting inside the head of the characters, especially Frank. Suffice it to say, if you liked the movie, you'll love the book. If you hated the movie, why are you even reading reviews of the book save to start an argument? Why not get started on that Honey Do list already or get the kids off to soccer practice?

I have been eager to see Bill Maher's Religulous and was not disappointed at all. Maher's scathing indictment of religion is exactly the kind of tool that should be used to educate the masses about how insidious and dangerous religion often is. If it fails on that note, at least it may give them some laughs. Since most adults are beyond hope of a serious change towards rational thought and away from their fairy tale beliefs, perhaps this movie should be standard viewing in all high schools or even middle schools just to serve as one attempt to free the minds of the next generation. As Helen Lovejoy once said, "Won't someone PLEASE think of the children???"That said; let's address some faults others have noted. First, one reviewer argued that religion is not the reason for the deep-seated hatred in people; it is merely the vehicle for its deliverance. Maher is attacking religion without dealing with the deeper issue. Fair enough, but that alone does not mean that education in pointless. To start with religion and its ridiculous concepts is the first step in getting people to let go of their fear, embrace their uncertainty, and eradicate their ignorance. Religion is precisely a problem because it enables those weaknesses and thus fertilizes the soil for the growth of hatred and intolerance. Religion is a problem because of the blanket of arrogance and elitism it creates among its followers, which thus fosters hatred for those who don't subscribe to their beliefs. Religion often teaches that not only are the believers right, but that the non-believers are so wrong that they have to be converted or killed. Maybe hatred is the real problem, but religion is one helluva gas can.Secondly, Maher is often criticized for his snarky and self-amused delivery. As I watched I saw more often than not how Maher's lame jokes fell flat and were often embarrassing. This wasn't a guy who was trying to pat himself on the back for his quick wit and clever methods of making others look stupid. In fact, he was quite willing to look like a boob with his lame jokes while simultaneously letting the zealots hang themselves with their own inconsistencies, lack of knowledge, and blatant lies. Furthermore, I didn't witness him cutting off people that much, save those who were making complete idiots of themselves, and in those instances, it was as much an act of mercy as anything else. Certainly we didn't need to listen to too much more of the babbling anti-Zion rabbi, the stoner in Amsterdam, the bling-sporting reverend, or the sexually confused preacher.Which brings me to the final complaint; this movie wasn't very informative and not a quality expose of religion. This is surprising to you? It's a freaking movie! It was never intended to be a scholarly examination of religion, but fully intended to be a comedic look at the already hellaciously comical concept of religion. Matter of fact, it's a shame that this movie was located in the documentary section of the rental shop. There's the real joke...People can't stomach someone poking fun at their religion. They take it frighteningly personal. Possibly because they are full of doubt and unsure of the path they are on. They surround themselves with like-minded people and close their eyes and ears to contradictory opinions. Like the trucker who stormed out of the one segment, some people's faith hangs by a thread. Movies like Religulous are the scissors that cut such threads. And then where do those people find themselves? Lost in their own minds, unsure of the world around them, uncertain about what happens in life or death. Welcome to the club, people. It's not so bad once you stop worrying about choosing the right side and decide to simply lead a good life, full of good deeds, and try to be the best person you can be for society, for your fellow man, and for yourself. But sadly, far too many frightened people have to have an incentive and/or a consequence to do the right thing, and that's your problem. It was mind-blowing to listen to Senator Pryor quibble about whether or not murder would take place outside of the Ten Commandments making it number five with a bullet. People voted that guy into public office. Scared yet?Final note - Maher does not address all religions, and in fact, steers clear of Hinduism, Buddhism, Paganism, and several others. Probably because I can't remember the last time a Buddhist strapped bombs to himself and got on a bus or shot a doctor in a church. Just sayin' is all....

One would think that with all the star-power Will Farrell brings and his comedic skills and goofy charm, the options to make really funny movies would be endless. So why then do we continue to get things that are just not that good? Will Farrel is fast beginning to resemble a one trick pony more than a sincerely talented actor and I keep finding myself wondering why the guy from Anchorman has yet to recapture that magic.Semi-Pro has no truly funny moments at all and instead focuses on a tired underdog sports story to carry the day. The hilarious David Koechner is wasted as the ABA commissioner and we are left to watch Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney yawn their way through their cliched roles and forced romantic sub-plot.Like so many lame comedies, you realize that you've seen the best parts of the movie via the heavy promotion this movie received and even that didn't stop this from tanking. It's just not that funny. The best scene is the poker game and that's not saying much since that scene isn't even that good. Semi-Pro is overloaded with the same stale 70s jokes that were better done in Anchorman, a horde of bizarre and underdeveloped characters (the ref/priest, Jackie Moon's freak wife, Andy Richter's role, etc.), and plenty of Will Farrell simply riffing his way through scenes and hoping for the best. Making matters worse, Farrell fades into the background half-way through and what little was left of the comedy dries up as well.Rent it if you must, but trust me, this isn't a movie you're going to want to own to watch again and again. Once is enough, thank you very little.Here's hoping that Ferrell's career isn't headed the way of the Kentucky Colonels et al.

Martin Booth's "A Very Private Gentlemen," also published as "The American" to coincide with the movie of the same name, is a methodical first person narrative on humanity, the value of life, the absurdity in our behavior, death's inevitability, and the daily battle to survive despite Booth's quite sour disposition on life. At times misanthropic, other times resigned and morose, and yet other times hopeful, it is insightful and honest.Known by the locals as Sr. Farfalle/Mr. Butterfly, the narrator is a hit-man/weapons craftsman who is beginning a new assignment which has taken him to the remote Italian countryside. The story unfolds from his narrative; his constant state of awareness/paranoia (much less frantic than Clooney's portrayal in the movie), the daily routines of his life in the small town, tales of his previous adventures, evocative passages about the beauty of Italy, and the details of his craft. Thankfully, there are conversations between Sr. Farfalle and his small circle of acquaintances, most specifically Father Benedetto and the prostitute Clara that provide welcome respite. These are oases in the novel, to be sure because the author's accounting of his life, work, and personal philosophies can get tedious at times. They start out as visual appealing, acutely observant, and at times even amusing in their simmering cynicism, but after a while shades of smugness appear. Booth is a good writer but his erudite nature sometimes interferes with the pleasure of the story.If you came to this novel from the movie (as I did), you already have an idea of the methodical nature of the tale; so the lack of page-turning excitement shouldn't surprise you or disappoint you too much. It differs from the movie in a few significant ways, but often movies developed from books do this. Additionally, like all novels made into films, the joy in reading is filling in the characters and getting deeper into their motivations and thinking. You'll find much to satisfy that need in this book, perhaps more than you care for. In my final summation, AVPG is an intelligent if sometimes slow musing on the human condition with just enough plot and suspense to keep you going until the end.3.5 stars

Killers is a retread of a formula done many times before, and generally better. The premise of Ashton Kutcher as the hit man who seeks to get out of the business and retire to suburbia but can't quite escape his past is hackneyed on one hand and poor casting on the other. The twist at the end is fairly transparent, especially given the lead-up to it, and the movie suffers from not being funny enough for a comedy and not being imaginative enough for an action movie.On the plus side, however, are Catherine O'Hara and Katherine Heigl. Both have good comic touch (O'Hara is one of the greatest comedic actresses ever) and manage to flesh-out their two-dimensional roles. Tom Selleck plays himself, as he has for his entire career, so take that for what it's worth. It's a shame that O'Hara is given so little to do save have a beverage prop in her hand throughout the movie. Furthermore, it seems very odd that her profoundly alcoholic character is written for laughs. I'm not complaining, because lectures from Hollywood are the height of hypocrisy, but still - is a woman who drinks heavily in every scene really that funny in this day and age?Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the high water mark for this kind of movie because the chemistry was clearly evident, the action was clever and fun, and the banter was well written. While Heigl tries hard, Kutcher is a weak actor at best and adding steroids to the well-trodden plot does not make it better.You can do worse than spending a few hours watching Killers on some movie network, but it's not worth buying.

I read so many reviews of this movie that were merciless in their hatred and in their contempt for those who liked the movie. The argument often employed in reviews is that one is an idiot for either liking or disliking something. Skipping the greater debate about what this says about our country; let me focus on the movie.Cameron Crowe has made some very nice movies and he's made some lousy ones. This is one of the really good ones, if not his best (haven't seen We Bought a Zoo yet, though...). It is tender, funny, and insightful. Additionally, it has his trademark great soundtrack choices (right up there with Scorcese) to provide further emotional attachment. The scene with an exuberant Cruise driving in the car while trying to find a song to celebrate with is smart and genuine.I won't argue that this movie is cheesy romantic or that it's driven by the narrow acting dimensions of Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger - neither of whom I'm hugely enamored of. On the other hand however, the script is strong enough that even they can't ruin it and Regina King and Cuba Gooding, Jr. give career performances.Yet, what I like most about it is the wisdom Crowe dispenses about love ("shouldn't be that hard"), relationships ("why do you love me?" or "we could lose ten years being nice") and devotion to the truly important things in life ("if this is empty (heart), this doesn't matter (head)"). It's a movie about loyalty, integrity, the maturation of a selfish man (not unlike Cruise's later role in The Last Samurai) and the importance of listening to the urgency of your heart and soul. It's a movie about doing the right thing.Jerry Maguire is a keeper.

I watched this again recently after purchasing it and was reacquainted with this lovely film. It is a sweet fable about personal freedom and the simple enjoyment of life. The acting is superb all the way around from the always great Judi Densch and Alfred Molina to the small but vital work of Johnny Depp (nice guitar work on the Robert Johnson and Django medley!)and culminates in the excellence of Juliette Binoche. It is a shame that her subtle and understated elegance lost out to the over-the-top performance by Julia Roberts for the Academy Award.The pacing, the tender storyline, the acting, the gorgeous scenery, and the precise musical scoring allow for a total abandonment of the self so that one can revel in the deliciousness of this film. Chocolat is rich, warm, and satisfying.

This is a hilarious and heart-warming tale of a group of downtrodden kung fu brothers who find new life in the world of football (soccer). It features the dynamic and hugely entertaining Stephen Chow, a man who makes his comrades in Western success Jackie Chan and Jet Li pale in comparison. Where Li is wooden and dull and Chan tries far too hard, Chow has an indifference that is refreshing. In some ways similar to his later offering, "Kung Fu (Hustle)," although less dark and violent, this movie is suitable for the whole family, particularly when you factor in the poignant lesson of avoiding prejudice.The action is over-the-top CGI magic and makes for many of the belly laughs, but the romantic subplot between Chow's dreamer and the ugly duckling bun maker is a sweet and unique concept. The mere fact that Chow creates a character that sees beauty beneath the scarred exterior of the skilled yet self-doubting street vendor is a testament to all that Hollywood fails to understand about their audience.I could watch this movie over and over and always get a laugh, get a warm feeling in my heart, and get a thrill out of the effortless kung fu magic of the extraordinarily gifted Stephen Chow.

A few months ago, my teen kids and I stumbled across this and were intrigued by the straight-from-a-young boy's-imagination description on the back of the dvd box, especially this jewel: "giant lizards with missile launchers." Still, not having that much disposable income, I decided against it. Months later, Christmas morning, my kids gave it to me as something of a joke gift. That night, the four of us gathered together, fully anticipating a glorious B-movie cheesefest. We were all so sadly disappointed. It isn't that the armed lizards weren't in it, but it was just so insipid, so poorly written and acted, and so entirely reliant on CGI effects that we found nothing to convince us not to take it back for a trade-in. You know a movie is bad when it fails to live up (or down) to even the most jaded movie fan's low standards. This movie had the overall feel of a bad tv show, or more accurately, a long, unending toy commercial (figures sold separately). I'd rather sit through episodes of The Land of the Lost until I went insane than watch this terrible film again. As for the special effects, this is the 21st century...so what? After Jurassic Park, it's all pretty much a yawn. Alas, so many movie makers feel that all that is needed are some CGI monsters/explosions/lizards with missile launchers and all other sins will be forgiven. It seems particularly appropo to the horror/sci-fi genre and explains why so many comic books and/or video games are coming to the big screen (with such poor results). Just because you can make it seem as if Mario and Luigi really are gobbling up mushrooms and beating on geese-turtles doesn't mean you should.In a marketplace overflowing with fantastically bad movies, you have far better choices for a night of hilarity and sarcastic voice-overs than this poor excuse of a movie. Furthermore, part of the charm of the 50s-70s crap is the supremely laughable special effects. To paraphrase reknowned sage and gag-inducing soccer mom Sarah Palin, you can put make-up on a pig, but it's still just a pig. Oink oink.

I used to love Aerosmith such a long time ago. Upon seeing the new disc in the store, I was greatly intrigued at the selection of songs. "No More No More" sold me immediately, and when I noticed the option of seeing it performed on dvd as well, it was in my hand to stay. Watching the band roll through "Draw The Line," I had warm flashbacks to a blurry black and white telecast of "CalJam 2" back in the pre-cable days. Hearing some of the dinosaurs played so well is a heartening thing for an old guy like me.Like so many A-smith fans, I have grown disillusioned with the band's foray into pop flavored Bon Jovi retreads. Making matters worse is the utterly annoying Steven Tyler, incessantly reminding us that he is perpertually anchored in a state of seventh grade sexual maturity. It is indeed a long way from the cleverness of "Pandora's Box" to the sophomoric "Pink." Still, the band has tried to stay musically focused, thanks to the sensible part of the songwriting pair, Joe Perry. His vision of blues, rock, and funk has been the umbilical cord back to the 70s, even if it has been hard to notice beneath the clean and soulless production often given the last few decade's output. Even the excitement and anticipation I felt toward Honkin' On Bobo was quickly crushed thanks to Tyler's lack of subtlety and the over-the-top sound.Thanks now, finally, for this recording. Albeit, cleaner than Live Bootleg (but isn't that part of the charm of that classic?)this is still the best slice of Aerosmith I've heard in nearly thirty years.

What a waste of a book. Thankfully I found it at the library so I'm not out any money. It's a cheap lie of a book that seems more like the concerted efforts of a fawning Amazon reviewer than a track-by-track insight. The author appears to conjure up the stories behind the songs based on magazine articles, random quotes, second and third-hand interviews, gossip, and God-knows what else. More than anything else, he merely describes the song (not very well, I might add), but in other cases he goes off on bizarre tangents.There's a particulary prescient comment he makes about one song that sums up the entire book, wherein he states: "Whatever the source material...."Exactly.

Public Enemies was a disappointment. Not of colossal proportions, but nonetheless, not as good as I thought it would be.Sadly, the biggest offense is that is was dull. I watched an hour long documentary on the Depression era bank robbers featured in the film and it was far more entertaining. Amazingly, this film manages to take what was a wild ride by a criminal who defied belief with his jail escapes and good fortune and turned it into a plodding half-baked love story coupled with an equally underdeveloped character study of the main two "public enemies," Dillinger and Purvis.An additional problem (that others noted as well) is the dialogue. Depp in particular mumbles a lot and I had to re-start from the beginning with the subtitles on to catch a good quarter of the dialogue I'd have otherwise missed. With today's filmmaking techniques, that's inexcusable. First of all, why have an actor mumble his lines and secondly, why not try to overdub them?Depp's Dillinger is predictably roguish, but the only real moment I felt the actor was stretching beyond a smirking exercise was after his gal was arrested. Depp can do much better but he was clearly type-cast and not really required to flex his acting muscle. As for Bale's Purvis...let me ask this; does Christian Bale know how to act beyond the same cold-blooded, wooden persona that brought him fame in American Psycho? Through a good half dozen roles I've seen him perform; he never changes or shows any range whatsoever.This seemed like a great opportunity to tell a tale about a man whose life was legendary, but the director (and I suppose the author of the book the movie was based on) spread things too thin and thus nothing stands out. It's as flat as the midwestern countryside that serves as much of the backdrop.It isn't horrible by any means, but it is not nearly as good as a story about the infamous John Dillinger could have and should have been. Like the hapless law enforcement officers chasing the elusive Dillinger, the director lets things slip through his fingers.

For many people, the real power of this movie is the opportunity to rubber-neck a tragedy and to see the humanity of it from the celebrities to the thugs to the innocent hippies trying to dodge pool cues and just have a good time. For me, this is a one-off thing and not a very interesting one at that. Yes, it was a tragedy and a man was killed. But this movie was supposed to be a documentary of the Rolling Stones 1969 U.S. tour, not a how NOT to get a free concert together and the I-told-you-so footage to remind everyone of how screwed up this idea was. We are subjected to supremely dull meetings with noted attorney and Star Trek cameo actor Melvin Belli serving as M.C., as well as other filler instead of seeing the actual concert footage. Not only are the Stones performances vastly under utilized, we also don't see B.B. King at all, scarcely see Ike & Tina Turner, and miss out on most of the other Altamont acts. Further frustrating me was the fact that the Stones footage was focused nearly exclusively on Jagger instead of giving us a chance to see the entire band. It just boggles the mind what priceless footage ended up on the cutting room floor.On the positive side, you do have the Stones footage, Jagger-centric as it is. You also have some very cool studio moments from both the mixing of the live album as well as the follow-up and you get to see the boys in fine musical euphoria...well, at least Keith.Even if this movie had to be re-released as a double disc with a greater attention paid to the musical performances and one devoted to the tragedy, that might be more suitable. As it is, even with some restored footage, this is big disappointment for me. If you would like to see a fairly well-done social commentary on the failings of the peace/love movement and how Altamont is representative of all that was right and wrong with the sixties, have at it. If you want to see the Stones in concert, be prepared to have your remote control handy.As for the extras, there really isn't that much to get excited about. First, you have a forty-four page booklet full of essays on the show. There are some interesting ones to be sure in Sonny Barger's no-holds-barred assessment, Jo Bergman's diary-like recollection, and Stanley Booth's re-hash of his experiences - found in better form in his excellent book about the tour. On the other side, you have Amy Taubin's piece, wherein she makes the base-less observation that "the joy went out of the Stones years ago," and offers plenty of insipid, knee-jerk Jagger-nalysis and more of the same boring droning on about the deeper meaning of the film and its role as a harbinger for the end of the hippie movement. If it was, I'm glad the Rolling Stones were there to usher in the end of that overly-hyped social movement. If only the next sixties alum to pat himself on the back for supposedly changing the world would be the last, I'd be a whole lot happier.Otherwise, the extra footage is fair at best. The most interesting is the mixing of Little Queen from the MSG shows. The performances of Little Queen, Carol, and Prodigal Son, along with the mini-jam/socializing with Ike and Tina Turner backstage are fraught with blank gaps. There is also a broadcast of the post-mortem from a San Francisco radio show that is really a waste of time as it's a audio broadcast with absolutely no video. No one says anything of interest outside of the aforementioned Sonny Barger, and his highlights are already in the movie.In the You Tube age, you could watch the best stuff there and skip the boring wrangling to get the show on, the beating of people with pool cues, the fat naked people, and save yourself thirty bucks.

I finally got around to watching this movie after years of procrastinating and choosing something else on a visit to the rental store or when shuffling through previewed movies somewhere. I read the many reviews and clearly am not a student of the films of Almod&oacute;var, his influences and tendencies, Spanish cinema, or even much of Pen&eacute;lope Cruz. I don't know if that disqualifies me to discuss my thoughts on this movie, but I thought it was good and am glad I picked it up.The dvd back cover describes the movie as "hilarious" and "comedic" and I am truly clueless as to how anyone could use those adjectives to describe a movie that deals with incest, murder, abuse, and cancer just for openers. Talk about misleading...Still, I enjoyed the movie and found the mysterious and at times disturbing story to keep my interest. The actors did a wonderful job and I was impressed with Cruz who I'd only seen in the horrid Vanilla Sky and in the disappointing Blow. She has to carry the movie and through the conclusion of the movie when all things are explained, I came to understand her brusque demeanor. Additionally, the scenery between Madrid and La Mancha was picaresque and a nice introduction to a country I have longed to visit.The extras on my copy had interviews with Cruz, Almod&oacute;var, and Carmen Maura. I noted one reviewer complained about the subtitles being choppy but my copy was smooth and without interruptions.As with most movie reviews on Amazon, the plot has been explained repeatedly and furthermore there seems no shortage of guys willing to confess their fascination with the female lead. In addition, there is a healthy discussion of the director and his work. Then again, perhaps it is simply a need to vomit up the wealth of knowledge gleaned from a life spent studying movies and trying to out-trivialize one another with their endless fact dropping. I am not sure where some of these reviewers fit.When I read the kind of reviews here, I wonder if this is a movie meant for pedestrian viewers like me. I wonder that my lack of knowledge regarding Almod&oacute;var et al detract from what I should gain from watching this movie. Yet, I enjoyed it and I don't know why others wouldn't as well even without joining the debate about strong female characters, how Sophia Loren fits into the picture, the director's female role model issues, European movies versus those from the states, gay themes, the back story of La Mancha, or any of the myriad other issues reviewers felt were necessary to point out in their opinions.I don't know about all of the women issues or the subtleties of the director and frankly don't care. I don't understand why the delineation has to come and be an issue. Who cares that there is only one man in the movie? Honestly, I didn't think to do a head count of gender as I was watching it. Also, there is some opinion that Almod&oacute;var is trying to lump all men into negative categories (unfaithful, sexually depraved, predatory, et al). I didn't make that stretch. The two men who are a part of the plot are representative of the cyclical nature of abuse rather than a broad categorization of all men. I realized at the end that Cruz' ex-boyfriend was evidence of the cycle of abuse that often happens rather than an indictment of all men. There was a brief moment with Cruz and her daughter towards the end that hinted at a final end to this disastrous cycle as it seemed to indicate that the daughter has made peace with what happened to her and the man who did it. I certainly hope so since the members of this fictional family have certainly been through enough drama and tragedy for one life.Volver is a well made and welcome break from the over abundance of predictable fare and I recommend it to anyone who likes good stories and good acting.

Just before things take a turn for the worse, Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating a letter. A line about inventory control underscores the heart of where he and his wife April (Kate Winslet) find themselves: "Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without..." Those answers seemed clear until Frank second-guessed himself, tempted by offers of prestige and money. If there is one lesson I have learned in life and that I will continuously remind my children of, it is that second guessing yourself, going against what your instincts tell you, is always the wrong thing to do. Revolutionary Road is a movie about a couple who face this crossroad in life and differ as to the right direction they should take. April listens to her instincts despite the dark uncertainty of her choice. Frank follows the well-lit and safe path.Revolutionary Road is a movie that splits people on either side, with those who feel it is a study in whiny, selfish, and immature suburbanites wishing for a better life than they currently have. Then there are those like me who felt a deep connection to them, in particular April; the one of the pair that seems the most trapped in the suburban dream and the one whose escape is the most criticalOf the two, April is largely attacked in reviews and I can't figure that out. She is the one accused of screwing things up and being the most difficult and unrealistic. Yet, she is the one who comes up with the idea to move to Paris as a gift to her husband. She is the one who realizes that "living life as if it matters" is beyond any price tag. If any one is at fault in my interpretation, it is Frank, who takes the path of least resistance and condemns his wife to a world of "emptiness and hopelessness."What this movie does is give voice to the minority of people who, like Winslet's character, find themselves trapped inside someone else's dream. Some of us break through, but most stay there, slowly wilting and collapsing under the strain of denying oneself of their own needs, suppressing one's soul, and doing what you feel you are supposed to do. Understand clearly that I am not making an indictment of the suburbs et al. For most people in the world, most people I know, and most people living that life, there is not the oppressive feeling of wasting life and the angst therein. What I am saying is that there are those of us who do not feel the same way about that life choice and this movie speaks to us. It's knee-jerk to not only take offense at the dim view Revolutionary Road portrays of The American Dream, but furthermore to see the Wheelers as little more than a spoiled couple; the assumption being they have everything and still they want more. On the contrary, my opinion is that being spoiled means wanting more and yet not wanting to give up what you have. The character of April Wheeler does not want what she has and knows what she needs - not more, but something entirely different. For those who have been in her tormented shoes, Revolutionary Road is a place some of us call Hell.

The Hangover is funny but predictable and therefore is not a comedy classic (as so many fawningly throw out in their snippet reviews) unless your parameters are very narrow. The Hangover would easily offend a large majority of people (which I'm totally fine with, since the easily offended are often the biggest hypocrites) and it is as age intended as the Twilight series. Just as there are forty-something moms swooning over the teen romance in that mawkish series, there will be older guys guffawing and high-fiving their fave moments from this innocuous flick. But the target audiences for both are teens and twenty-somethings whose average cinematic experiences compel them to coin the utterly useless word "classic" and apply it to this movie. Compounding the problem is the excess hype that started nearly at the premiere. It just goes to show you how powerful media saturation can be.In short, if you can imagine the highlights of the last five to ten years of movies from Will Ferrell, Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Ben Stiller, et al, you can pretty much predict where the laughs will come from.Endorsing the Vegas theme to the extreme, The Hangover is all about a wild weekend with no consequences. Take from that what you wish.

Fun Dog, Sun Dog, as the title implies, is a simple rhyming picture book about a boy and his dog. He describes her as many things in a rhythmic manner, as she plays with him, gets into mischief, and is always there when he needs her. It's easy to read (about a first grade level), although some of the words used to describe her get a bit challenging. The illustrations are engaging for pre-readers and it would make for a nice picture walk in kinder. It might also make a nice gift for a lover of dogs, especially goldens. 3.5 - 4 star range.

Right off the bat - Eddie Murphy deserved an Oscar for his performance in this movie. Robbing him for this extraordinary performance that I dare say no other actor in Hollywood today could've pulled off with such ease and brilliance is one of the Academy's biggest oversights. While he did win the National Society of Film Critics award, Murphy wasn't even nominated for the Oscar. Granted, the history of head-scratching moves by the Academy could fill pages; neglecting Murphy's work in this movie seems like one of the best examples of how comedy is largely ignored by the Academy.As for the movie, The Nutty Professor is crudely funny and highly enjoyable. Murphy is the only reason to watch the movie since he is on screen nearly the entire time in one character or another, and he never disappoints in any of the roles he plays. The plot is largely superfluous because the real treat of the movie is watching Murphy vamp and carry-on as only this comedic superstar can. This movie is Eddie Murphy on steroids and that makes for one hugely entertaining romp. If you wish to see one of the most impressive performances in cinema, catch The Nutty Professor and simply marvel at Murphy. Eddie hasn't always chosen the best parts but this tour-de-force is simply stunning.

Nearly a quarter of the reviews at this juncture rate Napoleon Dynamite as one star or, if possible, lower. As if to emphasize their displeasure, plenty of these reviewers attempt to educate those of us who do like this movie why we are foolish to like it, why it is such a colossal waste of time, why it is so boring, why it is not funny, etc., etc., etc. I am touched and flattered that you have come down from on high to offer your help in curing me of my poor taste. I can't thank you enough. Please order me a strong cocktail of Woody Allen movies and let me view them non-stop until I see the light of your comedic wisdom. Bless you, kind souls, bless you.For the rest of you out there who just don't get it, who can't stop enjoying this movie, who find it funny, charming, and quotable to the extreme, who would rather watch this for the twentieth time than attempt to sit through Woody Allen's tired offerings, I raise my glass of bleach-tainted milk to you. May your nun-chucks always fit in your locker, may your tots never get squashed, may your hair never get hot, and may you relax in peace in the hot tub with your soul mate forever. Peace out.

Shanghai Triad is another beautiful and unhurried film from Zhang Yimou. The amazing collaborative streak between Yimou and the remarkable Gong Li (in modern film, there are two actresses who never fail - Meryl Streep and Gong Li) once again succeeds with this take on the relationship between a nightclub singer/gangster's mistress and her new servant over a seven day period. Like most of his work, it is the bittersweet relationships between flawed characters and the breathtaking visuals that make this film something to savor. There are unexpected smiles preceding heartbreaking sadness and brilliant scenes forming the backdrop for agonizing tragedies. To watch his art is to pay an emotional price. Furthermore, his movies often linger long after the credits roll.Yimou has a gift for gradually pulling you into the lives of the characters. What starts with simple curiosity becomes fascination and finally morphs into commitment. Before you realize it, you find yourself wanting more time with the characters, more time to see the beauty of China, more time to cherish the gorgeous world Yimou has crafted.Shanghai Triad is not his finest work, but it is still worth escaping into.

At what point in man's progress did bratty behavior in children become the standard by which all are measured and parents became bumbling idiots who need aforementioned brats to save them from themselves and their stupidity? Also, when did cartoon movies (semantics aside) come so fast and furious and so maddeningly short on originality? If you want more evidence of the monkey see monkey do dilemma killing Hollywood, I submit: Madagascar vs. The Wild.Enter this movie. First of all, are there no other insects that behave socially? Was a third movie featuring ants really necessary? Do bees demand more at the negotiating table?As for the brats, the "star" of this waste of time is a bullied pain in the rear who deserves nothing but the grief he dishes out with such glee and malevolence. He never really apologizes with anything approaching sincerity and the lesson he learns (being a brat isn't always a good idea) is one I think he's should've learned long before. This punk gets beat up by the local thugs, so he then decides he needs to take his pent-up anger out on ants until they shrink him down to size to teach him a lesson. Whatever.The last problem with this garbage is the actors who provide the voices. Some actors have the dynamics to really bring life to cartoons. Nicholas Cage is not one of these actors. I really like Cage's work, but his voice is monotonous, death to voiceover work. Ditto for Julia Roberts. I'm sorry, but if you're not getting folks like Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres, e.g., then you're wasting everybody's time. Even the omnipresent Owen Wilson in this year's best (although still far from the mark) cartoon movie "Cars" has more vocal range than Cage or Roberts.This is a bad movie with no redeeming message, no heartwarming moments, no comedy, and no creativity. There is only one good bug movie, so do yourself and your family a favor and pull "A Bug's Life" out of closet and watch it instead.

Like many folks, I'm sure, I had high expectations for this movie. I enjoyed it in the theater but the buzz (bet you didn't see THAT coming, did you?) wore off soon after I pitched the popcorn container in the garbage. Jerry Seinfeld does a fair job in the unappreciated world of cartoon voiceover (just ask Nicolas Cage and/or Julia Roberts whose Ant Bully performances were horribly dull) and John Goodman is outstanding in his small but entertaining role. But the plot takes a bit long to get to the obvious point and the frighteningly real crisis in our world involving a demise in the bee population and the consequences therein is something that shouldn't be so easily remedied as it is here.There are plenty of funny moments and the thankful change from ants to bees was quite welcome, but I expected a bit more. I am still hoping for the Incredibles sequel or at least a return to that level of output from this crowded genre.

In devouring the films of Zhang Yimou lately, I finally got around to The Road Home. I find it amazing that some of the most profound, gorgeous, and unforgettable films are ones I'd scarcely heard of before watching them.Please don't be fooled by the brevity of this review. I've chewed up full pages with reviews of movies I hardly remember let alone enjoyed. But to be fair to my middling skills, there is little I can say about this movie except that it is quite possibly the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.If you're reading reviews of this film, you might already be aware that Yimou makes breathtakingly beautiful and emotionally evocative films. Rarely have I watched one of his films without marveling at the tremendous colors as well as happily giving in and shedding a tear or twenty. Beyond that, however, it is what this movie accomplishes using stunning simplicity that truly makes it noteworthy. How many romantic tales can you recall without the slightest physical interaction? When was the last (or first!) time you saw a movie where love was expressed solely in exquisitely simple tasks such as making a meal, cleaning a chalkboard, weaving a banner, or waiting for your love to walk down the road just so you can steal a heartbreakingly brief look into each other's eyes? From the very moment that Di and Luo's eyes meet, I was hooked. By the time Luo walks out of the school to see Di, I was a hopelessly blubbering fool in a way that The Notebook to the 10th power could never hope to elicit.But I've said enough. True love is real, true love is forever, and true love is pure and simple. If you believe that, you will absolutely cherish this movie as the rarest of jewels that it most assuredly is.

Let's face it - most of the people who are going to buy this are hardcore fans. Furthermore, this is exactly what you expect when you read the song list. One disc is devoted to songs they've played ad nauseum and recorded live on their historically inconsistent, yet perpetually offered live recordings.So then, why do we need another live version of any of those songs? I hate to be so harsh to my beloved Stones, but this and all of these live recordings (especially in the last decade or so) are pure and simple cash cows and/or contractual obligation filler. They know me too well, undoubtedly, for I am a sucker for the lapping tongue and will shell out the dough just to satisfy my jones. However, I'd much rather drop the cash on a studio album, even something lukewarm, than another live offering of "Honky Tonk Women," "Brown Sugar," or "Happy," simply for something new to listen to from this band.Speaking of "new," the second disc has some gems and is worth the money invested ONLY IF you are a big Stones fan and need to hear them do some meaningful covers and rarer stuff.The Stones need to realize that at this stage of the game, they aren't going to convert too many new fans, especially with so many studio recordings, greatest hits collections, live albums, etc. out there to better recruit new generations. What would better serve those of us who truly enjoy the group would be a double live disc of the rare stuff - and please do it without editing. One reviewer generously blew off the "Rocks Off" disaster as saying it was only "two seconds," and that it was "seamless." Well, it is more like ten, and the time isn't the issue. Isn't the scream in "Won't Get Fooled Again" one of the high points of the song? Would you be equally gracious about an edited version of that song sans the scream? Also, it is only seamless to someone not familiar with the song. For the rest of us, it was as jarring and buzz-killing as a skipping cd.As far as this being an artistic choice or some other excuse, my guess is that this was simply a bad decision. They must've had other versions of the song that worked without editing, and if not, why include it on the cd? This is a poor choice, and since most of us buying this cd are going to notice, why be so careless?Lastly, if the group still insists on releasing live albums, why not throw us all the bone we've been waiting for and put out something from the '72 tour? While you're at it, re-release the documentary film of the tour as well. Unfortunately, it'll take the death of Keith or Mick to bring about this option, and many of us are more likely to die before Keith does, so we're simply s.o.l.If you're hardcore Stones, I'm wasting my time because you've already bought it. If you're on the fence or looking to venture into the music of the Rolling Stones, either pick up one of the hits collections or buy "Exile on Main Street" and cut to the chase, but skip this one. It'll always be for sale used if you become a junkie like me.

I love Stan Lee. I love Spider-Man to death. I love Marvel Comics. But, I do not like this movie nor most of the movies that Marvel Studios puts out. While the problems are many, this one seems to sum up most of them. First, they favor style over substance. One of the cooler things about Marvel Comics (and many comics in general) is that they are clearly not puerile. Even noted researcher Steve Krashen has spoken favorably of the power of comic books to unlock reluctant readers and he quotes some writing from a Fantastic Four comic from back in the day to support his claims of high levels of vocabulary, plot, character development, and so on. So why these cheesy movies? Going back to Ghost Rider and Spider-Man 3 before this, you have three bad movies in a row. Given the state of the art currently available, the visual concerns are addressed so that it is believable when super heroes do super things. Unlike super heroes movies of the past which featured horrible special effects, today's movies clearly have solved that issue. So the problem for all three then is the writing.This movie is full of some ugly dialogue clunkers, some comedy pratfalls that would make the current producers of the new Scooby Doo cartoons (or anything with Jim Belushi) blush, and really dull action sequences. The actors themselves do little more than cliched actions, most offensively Michael Chiklis and the cardboard Barbie doll Jessica Alba, and even a really cool character like The Silver Surfer seems wasted. Why not bring Spider-Man into the mix since they both had comic book episodes together and the tension between the rivals Spider-Man and The Human Torch would make for some good potential. Alas, I fear it would be wasted with corny lines, empty flash, and the supremely embarrassing joke-within-a-joke product endorsement so prevalent in this film. Why not just have the characters do short promos before the film starts? It would be scarcely less subtle.When a great bad guy like Doctor Doom is rendered as boring and non-threatening as a two-bit street thug, you know you've missed the target by a long shot. Until Marvel can really put together something worthy of the comics from which these movies spawn, I fear more of the same. I wish Stan Lee et al would put as much time into developing the movies of his beloved characters as he did into the comics themselves. That would truly be heroic.

I'm a bedroom player so take that for what it's worth right off the top. These strings play smoothly, have a nice light feel, and fell into tune quickly. I tend to stretch strings when I install them and in this case, once was good, tuned them, and they stayed in tune from then forward. The packaging was unique in that there were no inner sleeves for each string but instead all were enclosed in one envelope with the the endings color coded. Seemed environmentally smart to me. Given my limited knowledge of what makes strings good, better, or best, that's about all my perspective can offer. No complaints at all.

Aaron Eckhart is fast becoming one of my favorite actors to watch (The Dark Night and Conversations with Other Women both showcase his talent) but my interest started with his excellent portrayal of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry in this great movie.It's hard to find fault in Thank You For Smoking. It features an intelligent script, sharp and disciplined acting, and smooth yet brisk pacing. There are plenty of laughs, a perfect dose of heart, and a filleting of not only the lobby world, but of government, Hollywood, power, and the gullible American public that is surgically precise. There are no punches pulled here, Eckhart leads a brilliant cast of actors and Thank You For Smoking is easily one of the best satire comedies I have seen in a long time. When you look at how much praise Tropic Thunder got for trying (unsuccessfully) to pull off the same skewering satire, it should make you appreciate a gem like TYFS that much more. This is highly recommended.

This is an album that I have come to appreciate as time has gone by, but many of the things that I originally had problems with still remain. Mostly they are the surprisingly inane songs like "Cool, Calm, Collected" and "Something Happened to me Yesterday." There is also the misstep of "She Smiled Sweetly" which goes so far away from the Stones strengths that I can see it being covered by Paul Anka. The first two sound like ridiculous attempts to copy the Beatles equally moronic kindergarten sing-a-longs like "Yellow Submarine." These things are avoidable to be sure, but they also reduce the rating, if for no other reason than because they are so incredibly insipid.On the positive side, I've come to really appreciate the rest of the tunes, especially on the U.K. version which I like much more than the U.S. version. While I miss "Ruby Tuesday," it's worth the trade-off to get the others, especially one of the most simultaneously cruel and yet endearing songs about being a groupie in the scathing "Backstreet Girl." Jagger is the greatest lyricist when it comes to being anti-romantic. The other numbers which are found on both U.S. and U.K. versions are good to great. The first four songs are very good from the excellent "Yesterday's Papers" (with Brian's vibes adding a gorgeous touch) to the rocking Keith riff rocking number "Connection."This is as much a product of the times as Some Girls was in the late seventies or Undercover was in the eighties. There is a heavy sixties feel complete with the unfortunate psychedelic influences they'd mine deeper on the follow up to this one. That aside, there are still some well written songs and you can sense the pending brilliance of the oft-celebrated quartet of albums that were to commence a year from this curious part of the Stone's career.

This is one helluva debut! It is catchy, fresh, imaginative, and indicative of their myriad influences.Keith gives us plenty of two-string riffs, Mick shows his range, Brian shows his versatility, and the rhythm section sounds tight. Some of the stuff is a bit of a stretch ("Can I Get A Witness"), but let's face it - we could say that about every recording this band has ever released, right?The stand-outs are pure joy; "I'm A King Bee," "Carol," "Not Fade Away," "Route 66," "Tell Me," "Little by Little," and the blues instrumental "Now I've Got A Witness," the latter two showcasing Keith's nascent interpretations of the work of his blues/rock guitar influences.This is a fantastic album that serves as a splendid launching point for this remarkable band and a wonderful introduction for anyone interested in exploring their deep, solid roots.

Once again I see a movie from China that knocks me out and I reflect on how sad it is that so few people will see this. As of today, this will be only the seventh review for a movie that has been out since 2008. On the other hand, there are probably hundreds of reviews for any of a number of retreaded, predictable, juvenile, CGI-driven, product peddling, Pixar'd, cloying, and/or disturbingly violent movies that can't hold a candle to the beauty, emotional power, and sheer loveliness of If You Are the One.Chinese favorite You Ge and the lovely Qi Shu play the two main characters and imbue their performances with nuance, genuine chemistry, and emotion. Throughout the two hours, I was moved to guffaws of laughter as well as lip-quivering tears. Xioagang Feng's poignant contemplations on love, relationships, marriage, and heartbreak struck nerve after nerve in me.It saddens me that what passes for wisdom in Hollywood offerings usually reflects not so much our shared global humanity but rather our peculiar self-absorbed ethos and our superficiality. There are movies that are quite good (I just saw The Descendents and it was very good), but the vast majority is the equivalent of fast food - garbage that appeals to the lowest common denominator. Indeed, there might be no better reflection of the decline of our society than the low number of well made movies coming out of Hollywood. How sad that, more often than not, Pixar makes the movies that touch us emotionally.I apologize for this rant embedded in a review, but when I see such a beautiful motion picture as this one, I think how fortunate I am to have a fianc&eacute; who is Chinese to even bring this director to my attention. I hope to pass on this rare find to you. Indeed, this is the kind of experience you want to share with your fellow citizens. Isn't that what these reviews are really about? Isn't it about offering your opinion for the benefit of your brothers and sisters so that they might share in what you experienced (or be forewarned)? Highly recommended.

Hi Fidelity is one of the many movies that comes highly recommended and fails to deliver. In keeping with the spirit of it, however, let me present The Top Five reasons that Hi Fidelity is an average movie:1. John Cusack. He is an actor I'm not sold on by any means despite having seen many of his films. Herein he does his Woody Allen best to talk to the audience about his failed relationships. I don't know what it is about Cusack specifically, maybe it's his weasely look, maybe it's the lack of charisma that some actors have and that others don't, or maybe it's the fact that all the smoking, hunched over slacker posing, and Intro to Drama mannerisms he employs fail to convince me that he is capable of carrying a film, especially as an adult. For comparative purposes, Jack Black steals every scene he is in, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones.2. The film fails to deliver on either the romantic or comedic level, the two genres it's targeted towards. Not ever funny enough (save the fantasy sequence with Robbins in the record store) or romantic enough, it left me wanting so much more.3. The premise is clogged by errors that undermine it completely. More glaring; how is it that this man of Top Five lists, who obsesses about chronicling his life and the minutiae therein into portable containers of memory, not realize until years afterward that one of his five biggest break-ups was caused by him and thus not even a part of his list? It would be akin to maintaining a Top Five records list that features a t.v. show. That seems so incredible to me that I almost wondered why the film put it in. I assume it's to show that his hindsight has sharpened some and he can absorb the blame that he used to reflect onto others, but I'm not convinced.4. Given number three, I'm not sold on his relationship and life epiphanies, and so, reason four. Zeta-Jones' character has it right when she rolls her eyes in exasperation at yet another "what is it all about?" person who can solve such a momentous question by focusing solely on failed relationships. It's the equivalent of trying to find a cure for cancer by focusing on male enhancement formulas. Furthermore, when he does make some realizations, he makes the wrong ones! Say what you want about her shallow character or Black's elitist music geek; they both stay honest to their core personality.5. He chooses the wrong girl. He settles. He makes the choice that this woman, for whom he clearly has major problems, is the answer to his dreams simply because he is tired of looking. That's it. You can couch it in your own terms, but for me, his revelation to his on/off girlfriend that he has decided against pursuing the record reviewing woman who recently entered his life for her and their problematic relationship is a safe, scared, and uninspired moment of clarity. Call me bitter, a romantic idiot, a dreamer, a relationship elitist, or whatever you wish, but if you are really happy with the person you are with, if you really can't wait to see them each day, if the rest of the people in the world disappear when they enter the room, why would you ever find yourself considering someone else? That's not true love, that's settling for satisfactory. He should have moved forward and tried life with the other girl instead of moving backward. Maybe he grew up some and assumed some responsibility and ownership for his life. If that's the moral of the story, forgive me for not agreeing. If you believe that growing up and maturing means settling into the slow, passive crawl to death, go right ahead. Cusack's Rob character is thus a faux-rebel; a person who outwardly wants to be different and unique and fight the system that grinds romantic souls into complacent couples, but inwardly he longs to get off the train at Cul de Sac, USA where satisfied couples gather on Saturdays with the women drinking Merlot inside and talking about their new house additions or taking care of the kids and the guys in the back yard drinking light beer and comparing barbecue grills or titanium drivers. The moral of that story? Find any way you can to stuff material items into the emptiness in your heart and soul. Can you smell the banality? Me, I'm going after The One until I find her and I won't settle for less and I'll consequently avoid ever repeating those pathetic suburban nightmares that I once endured.Hi Fidelity settles.

Stones in Exile, the eagerly anticipated dvd companion piece to the re-release of Exile on Main Street is a fascinating and highly worthwhile document. It is important to point out how the entirety of this dvd constitutes the evidence of my argument. The initial hour long piece must be coupled with the bonus interviews to fully flesh out the history, the mythology, the influence, the timelessness, and the miracle that is the album.The main feature is a sweeping mosaic of photos, old and new film footage, snippets from CS Blues and Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, and scores of interviews that form the overdubbed narrative to the story. We get the history of not only the circumstances but the recording itself including some great background about various tracks which is always fascinating to me. For hardcore fans much of the material has been seen before, but there are many places where you think you've seen or heard it before and realize you haven't. A great example: an infamous photo of Keith playing guitar with Gram Parsons beside him, is now expanded to show how this heretofore assumed private moment was actually going on near a table full of guests, thus the photo and the mental image behind it are totally transformed. Also, you get interviews from some highly unusual and yet truly illuminating participants, some quite accidentally. Listening to the recollections of an eight-year old child's role at Nellcote is at once horrifying and charming. This dvd is full of enough of these treasures to soften even the most bitter Stones' fans who complain of nothing new under the sun. I'm a fair-sized Stones collector and even I had never heard Anita Pallenberg speak of her life with Keith, let alone get some lucid and interesting tales. Speaking of lucid, it's endearing to see how Keith has morphed into Johnny Cash, gray hair and all, speaking with a clarity and frankness that is refreshing.The bonus features rival the main feature in terms of value despite some questionable interview choices. There are two interview sections, one with the band and one with fans. The fan part, "Exile Pans," is an endless hyperbolic homage to the folklore and personal affect the band and this album had on their younger musician fans. The Kings of Leon member and Will.I.Am seem to have the least to offer and I find it hard to believe that there weren't two other artists who came closer to the level of devotion and Stones' fandom that Sheryl Crow and Liz Phair do. Jack White makes some sense too, but the highlight is Don Was providing a very detailed and thoughtful opinion on the album/band's impact as well as giving plenty of insight into his experiences working with The Rolling Stones. I can't imagine any Stones fan not nodding their head in agreement with Was. Ditto for Liz Phair, who may get a bit off-point at times, but nonetheless shares her heartfelt affection and attraction to this album that only the truest fans of a group understand. Hearing rock stars themselves wax poetically about an album that you both share such a deep love for is powerful. At heart, we are all fans and these interviews bring that point home marvelously. My only complaint is that they should have been relegated exclusively to the bonus feature instead of bookending the main piece wherein they seem tacked on and unnecessary.The band interviews go deeper into the explanations touched upon in the feature film and offer a wealth of background, de-bunking and validity to the wildly varying stories that orbit around this work. It is a lovely contradiction to hear them talk in very matter-of-fact terms of what they did versus the breathless confessions of the fans. To the band, this was simply another album to make that had some unusual recording circumstances. To the fans and critics, this represents so much more. Don Was hits on this with his comment about how musicians don't just want to make records that sound like Exile but they want to live that glorified legendary lifestyle. To fans, Exile on Main Street clearly represents so much more than eighteen amazing songs. It stands for excess, bohemianism, sex, drugs, booze, darkness, evil, hedonism, danger, fear, wanting, and desperation, and that's just a sampling. If all Rolling Stones roads lead to Main Street as I believe, it can also be said that those same roads lead outward in a billion different directions to the people this album touches, influences, jolts, comforts, moves, and heals.I have a lot of Stones dvds and I rarely watch them. This is one that I will watch often because there is a shared joy in the whole viewing process. As I watched, I became part of a discussion group of like-minded individuals, united by our love of this epic album. A sense of belonging such as this film creates is a precious thing indeed.What are you doing this weekend, Liz Phair?

I often chose to read what others thought of a movie before I write my own review, and I generally gravitate to the reviews that are contrary to my own because I want to know what perhaps I missed or willfully ignored the first time through. I loved Eat Drink Man Woman so I had to read some of the one and two star reviews to see why others disliked it so much. From what I've gathered, the negativity underscores larger issues I have with so much of the crap that comes out of Hollywood. That a movie as touching, heartfelt, and lovely as this is seen as boring to others proves my larger point; movies like Eat Drink Man Woman aren't made enough in America and when they do get made, they are often watered down adaptations of grander ideas, streamlined for the short attention span Hollywood has helped create. In other words; in the absence of Seth Rogan's on-going juvenile antics or Saw-like torture, what movie is truly worthwhile to the typical American movie-goer?Sarcasm aside, there is so much to revel in here; mouthwatering food, the artistry of its preparation, the need to follow our truest calling, the mystery of love, the tempestuous and conflicting nature of family relations, and the universal scope of all of these issues. Ang Lee delivers a delicious feast of humanity that satisfied my hunger for movies that value artistic integrity over box office receipts. True to the food theme of this beautiful work, for every hundred fast food joints, spread like choking dandelions across the landscape, there blooms one lovely flower of a restaurant where the food is expertly prepared and where time slows to allow the splendor of the moment to envelope you and open your senses to the totality of the experience. Eat Drink Man Woman is such an experience.

Treeless Mountain is a heartbreaking and stark docu-drama about two abandoned girls. As I watched these young children (5 & 7) make their way through their Korean world, I thought of similarly aged children here in the U.S. and how sheltered and spoiled they are comparatively. How relative is hardship?That issue aside, Treeless Mountain is a lovely, albeit slow, and often sad movie that underscores the strength of children and the flexibility of family and community. Despite being bandied about from a mother who can't support them to an aunt who doesn't wish to care for them, they press on with strikingly strong survival skills and a deep love for each other. Their innocence, trust, and purity of heart are tested by a world that takes little note of them as they wait hopefully for their mother to return. Eventually, the two girls end up in the sympathetic and loving care of their grandmother, whose genuine tenderness and concern bring joy and song back into their lives.The director uses shots of the sky as segues from one scene to another. One memorable and poignant transition shows the sun enveloped by a dark and sinister looking cloud. Just as the shot ends, the sun breaks free on the other side of the cloud's mandible-like grasp. It's powerful and beautiful, just like this movie.

I remember hearing Precious on the old M105 outside of Cleveland back when it was first released. Christ, what a song! I was sold at that moment and the album didn't disappoint. It is an unbelievable debut, especially considering that it came out during the pre-MTV days when labels still took a chance on groups instead of the "safety first" attitude that now prevents so many groups from record deals and sends them to the internet to market their wares. This band couldn't have been a safe bet by any means! This is a frantic, punky, sexy, sonic dose of autobiographical material from the jaded mind of Chrissie Hynde. Better yet, the material does not sound dated like so much from the late 70s/early 80s (except for the hip-at-the-time Space Invaders sample!), thanks to the lack of synth and the timeless incindiery guitar work of the late great Jimmy Honeyman-Scott. I feel fortunate to have seen this band in Pittsburgh just after they released the fantastic follow-up to this album, and they were just as intense and powerful live as on those two fantastic albums. An essential rock and roll record.

The last offering from the original and best line-up. Most disappointing is the loss of Honeyman-Scott, who combined the sonic insanity of Jeff Beck with the proper punk aesthetic Chrissie was looking for. None of the fellows to follow would fill his shoes fully. Lame alliterations aside, this is an excellent follow-up to the first album (and the EP that bridged these two) and it is under-represented on the recent box set. It pisses me off a bit that record compnaies and bands re-release efforts with nuggets heretofore unavailable which makes one have to buy two of the same cd, and from the gossip, it appears re-issues of the first two full length records are due. I'd like to have the EP songs (Cuban Slide and Porcelain never made it to this album and the latter, along with Nausea from X, are the two greatest songs about hangovers/hurling I've ever heard), but this is still a great album on it's own. Pack It Up is a great straight-ahead rocker, you get the two hits in Message of Love and Talk of the Town (my favorite), plenty to remind you of the first album (the first two songs), some songs that add variety to the mix in Jealous Dogs and The English Roses, and the requisite Kinks cover. This is a great album and one of the best of the decade. Their style changed after this album and II stands as one of just two powerful testaments to the brilliance of this great band.

My biggest regret was not reading these reviews before I rented this colossal waste of time. I realize that most rentals are impulsive and we can't plan out our lives to go and browse Amazon reviews before renting, especially older stock like this seven year old garbage, but still...I have wasted my money so hopefully you don't have to.No redeeming qualities about this movie at all. Sadly, I'm amazed at some of the reviewers saying that it is worth it to see Farrah Fawcett or Helen Hunt naked. And you admit this freely? Put away the tissues and get out of your parent's basement right now! The rest of you, avoid this. Despite some great actors and a reknowned director, this is not good. No characters to like - not one, a ridiculous plot, and an ending that is satisfying only because it is the rotten cherry on this terrible cake, so at least the ending is as bad as the rest of it.The most bothersome thing is that you have reviewers who rate this so highly on the cover of the dvd, a shameful act of shilling for garbage that makes you doubt the integrity of the reviewer.

This is a difficult album because it follows their two finest studio albums. Still, it's got a lot of good, a little so-so, and no bad. It's head and shoulders above the studio albums to follow, that's for sure. For one thing, it is one of the last to blend Tyler's vocals more solidly in with the rest of the music instead of making his screeches and such so prominent as they do in the decades to follow. It's nice to hear the band playing and not have it drowned out by Tyler.The first five songs are relentless rock, including Perry's oddity, Bright Light Fright, a rough-edged number that must've left Joey Kramer sweat drenched. He literally pounds his kit from beginning to end. The other four are well done and include some all-time classic Tyler lines (who else incorporates Edgar Allen Poe in a rock number?) that make for great lyric deciphering. When the guy is on, he's damn good.Kings and Queens is hit and miss for me, they are reaching a bit here, and while it is a noble effort, it doesn't ever work totally. The remaining songs are good efforts, and I think the closing cover of Milk Cow Blues is the gem of the whole album. Careening out of control at the end of the song, before culminating in a crashing finale, this sums up their career trajectory far better than a dozen Behind The Music specials.

Taken as a history of China during the 20th century, Wild Swans is a powerful first-hand account of the events which continue to influence the country today. From this perspective, I enjoyed it and found it compelling enough to slog through the oft-slow going story. Viewed as a memoir, it is a bit more complicated. At its core, it is a story of one family and, in particular, the women who make up three generations of struggle and perseverance. Beyond that, however, it is a story that demands more. As one reviewer put it, there is a need for much more honesty from author Jung Chang.My biggest complaints lie in the lack of accountability and the inconsistencies that run through Chang's narrative. Chang seeks solely to blame, and lashes out against Mao instead of using some objectivity to review her past. Her anger is rooted in the growing sense of disillusionment that finally pushes her to see Mao as less than the unfailing God she'd long felt he was. Fair enough, as I know she wasn't the only one duped by the crushing propaganda machine. But, were her parents not prominent parts of that very machine? Throughout the events that are described, her family is above reproach. They were noble idealists who became victims of Mao's evil. Despite the gray that colored much of her world during these tumultuous decades, Chang's recollections are purely black and white.Wild Swans is part of Chang's personal vendetta against Mao (continued in her scathing biography), and that's her right. But when this is done via a dishonest assessment of the role her parents and she herself played in the history she recounts, it loses much of its power. For tens of millions of people to die, more than one person has to take the blame.

The reviews seem to either slam this for being too far of a deviation from the norm and too blatantly poppy and saccharine to hailing it for those same reasons. I just like it for what it is. There are some pieces I wonder about, but that is the same with nearly every REM album, even the brilliant Document has songs that don't seem to fit, and so it is on Out of Time.There are plenty of songs I like and amazingly, after repeated plays on radio, Losing My Religion is still that unique hit that doesn't tire out. Maybe it's because it is so lyrically intriguing, I don't know. The only questionable songs I have are Endgame, which sounds like an excessively long intro to Shiny Happy People and, well, Shiny Happy People. I don't mind the song, but it grates on you after a while and seems a bit too much. I'm not analyzing the sarcasm or lack thereof, I just know that it doesn't sound good to me. Speaking of Endgame, I wonder why Peter Buck, a limited albeit melodic guitarist, is so fond of instrumentals on REM recordings. What's the point? Jeff Beck he ain't and even Hendrix eschewed instrumentals for the most part, so why so many from such a modestly talented guitarist? Just a thought.This album is a bit dated and not as in your face as its two preceding brothers nor as jangly and narrow as the band's first three. It is not the sonic overload of Monster. If anything, it is a singular moment in their history where they tried a lot of new ideas and thus loosened the constraints they'd placed on themselves and allowed for the band's future forays. It is a good but not vital part of their catalog.

This album is a fun reminder of high school that doesn't hold up to the test of time. Van Halen emerged during a lull in the high water mark of hard rock. Aerosmith was self-destructing, Ted Nugent had become self-parody, and countless other rocking bands were too busy snorting, shooting, or chugging to make much difference. Enter the ego-maniacal Edward Van Halen, erroneously credited with inventing a technique he merely popularized to the point that every idiot with a guitar and a can of hair spray thought they knew how to play. Teamed up with the utterly pathetic self-promoting Plant-wannabe with the clever monikor of David Lee Roth, and you had the one-two punch of Van Halen.The song writing is okay but nothing stellar emerges. The best songs are bombastic glory ("Runnin' With The Devil") and covers (the Kinks) and, more interestingly, give little indication of their predilection for corporate rock, ala Journey, by the time Roth was punching out and Mr. Annoying Sammy Hagar was replacing him.Yeah, Edward is an unbelievably fleet fingered guitarist who has come up with truly unique guitar work. So what? So have countless guitarists who garner half the glory and who handle their fame with much less arrogance than the ex-Mr. Bertinelli.As fame went to their heads, the band increasingly held their fans in contempt, releasing albums that clocked in slightly over a half hour and were chock full of written-on-the-fly garbage that shows all the concern of a band of egotists and self-annointed superstars. Somebody get me a doctor, indeed.

The good: The satire of suburban life and all of its banality. It does this a lot in the early going and it is spot-on and funny. Also, Black is good enough. There are enough laughs to keep you going.The bad: The movie bogs down with the plot and there are things that just don't add up, that seem forced, and that strain credulity.The ugly: I'm not sure why Christopher Walken is even in the movie. His character serves as a distraction and an unnecessary scenery chewing waste of time. I love Walken, but his character is tacked on and brings little but filler to the movie.Perhaps, in the end, that's where the movie falters - it isn't fully formed. It is some ideas thrown together and has a patch-work feel to it.Envy isn't awful, it's just not great. If you can get it cheap, it's worth the five bucks or so you can buy it with. You may watch it more than once and therein you've made it worth your while. I have watched it a few times and find enough to laugh at and enjoy even if the critical part of me can spot the holes and shortcomings.If you want some cheap innocuous entertainment, you could do a lot worse.

I'm not a huge fan of this movie - let's get that out of the way up front. I think the book was original and charming and the movie was simply over the top, a techno orgasm. Furthermore, I don't care for this type of animation. Why would animation want to try to look deceivingly real? I don't get it. I enjoy animation that revels in its absurdity rather than trying to fool the audience or make them gasp with amazement at how realistic it looks. Lastly, call me old fashioned, but I'm a fan of the tv specials of the 60s that celebrated Christmas, and they are the measurement of joyful holiday viewing I hold all other movies, specials, etc. up against.Imagine how surprised I was when I showed this in my kindergarten class today and the children were mesmerized! You must understand (those of you who work with youngsters can attest), having two dozen kids sit quietly for over ninety minutes is nothing short of miraculous. No matter how popular or entertaining the choice is, there are always a handful who get squirrely and start chatting or bothering their classmates, and soon the viewing devolves into a battle to keep the room quiet for those who want to continue watching. And yet, today the room was quiet and engaged!It struck me that perhaps this was a new tradition that had been born. This movie, despite my misgivings, has managed to perform the kind of seasonal magic that so many films strive for and so many never achieve. The children were getting the message, thrilled with the wild ride, and, sorry for the heavy handed cliche, but BELIEVING! Amazing. They may never know the Rankin-Bass delight of cheesy stop-action puppetry, the hilarious dance scenes of the Peanuts gang, or the sinister glory of Chuck Jones' Grinch, but damn if they haven't found their own Christmas classic to revel in for those years they chose to believe. One day they may try to foist this on their children and come away with the same sadness and disillusion that I had when my kids (mine and the school children) yawn during Rudolph, but hopefully they'll learn the same lesson I did. Merry Christmas!

I'd give it an additional half star rating, but that's about it. If solid efforts like Draw The Line muster a 3, good but not quite perfect stuff like their first album and Live Bootleg rank 4, then this can't be rated higher. This relates to the stuff from the first Aero go 'round in the 70s.This isn't awful, but it's cut and paste and really is awful in some places. Mia, an almost unlistenable moaning Chinese water torture song, and Remember (Walking in the Sand), an unbelievably bad choice for a cover (thank Tyler for both of these) are the low points to be sure.On the other hand, Three Mile Smile, sans Perry, is a good song, as are Bone to Bone, Chiquita, No Surprize, and Cheesecake, the latter a nice slide workout. Solid Aero stuff.The other covers, the Yardbirds Think About It, and the chestnut Reefer Head Woman, are a mixed bag. Nice to tribute your influences, but save them for the stage. Given the state of their heads at this point, it's easy to see why they had to borrow so many songs just to complete this uneven effort.Aero-heads own it, no doubt, but the rest of you could better spend your money on something else.

Having all but the originals from this collection on various other cds made this a continuous pass-over when I would visit record shops. Getting it for Christmas this morning, however, makes it well worth owning. For completists, you get the new stuff, for newbies it is a great overall introduction going up through Bridges to Babylon, and for collectors you get a beautiful softcover booklet with great photos and a brief essay and a very cool four-fold black and white poster of the five original lads that would look fantastic framed and hung on the wall of a Stones fan on your gift list.There are arguments to be made for questionable inclusions and objectionable exclusions, but that is the case with any hits collection. I look at it as a very reasonably priced gift and I think the lucky ones who find it under their tree will agree. Merry Christmas!

What a surprise this cd is! While most of the reviews give it five stars (nice touch, Amazon, by the way with the new look of the review pages), outside of Amazon, it is arguably the most slagged off Stones' effort in their history. While it is not their greatest by a long shot, it is better than many I've long since owned and listened to. I finally gave in to buy this and was really glad that I did. Despite being a Stones' head for over three decades, I have avoided owning this, largely due to my dislike of psychedelia as well as the enormous amount of derision it has received. Man, was I wrong! This cd knocked me out right from the first listen. What blows my mind so much is the fact that this is a disc which, despite the psychedelic influence, contains some very strong guitar work. good melodies, nice acoustic work, prototypical Keef riffs, and a handful of songs that sound like they could've easily been on the follow-up to this (Beggar's Banquet). From all I'd read about it, I was expecting the Stones meet Pink Floyd, but at the core, this album stays true to the Stones. Yes, the eight plus minutes of Sing This All Together (See What Happens), a reprise of the opening number, is loaded with plenty of LSD influenced nonsense, but there are arguably more trippy and clearly more ridiculous things on Between the Buttons, a critically well-received album released the same year this nugget was released.In short, I can not urge you strongly enough to investigate this disc on your own. While it might seem as if I'm damning this album with faint praise, let me say that I sincerely believe you won't be disappointed. It may never be your favorite Stones recording, but I doubt very highly that it would ever be considered your least favorite either.

After some gift cards, a discount coupon, and twelve bucks out of my own pocket, I finally purchased the remastered Get Your Ya-Ya's Out concert package.First up, the dvd. While only twenty-seven minutes in length, it is precisely what the movie Gimmie Shelter is not and for that, I am eminently grateful. If only we could have the entire show put out coupled with the priceless off stage footage of the band instead of lawyers and promoters, you'd have a documentary of the tour that would be the fitting tribute it started out to be. There are five full songs (Prodigal Son, You Gotta Move, Under My Thumb, I'm Free, and Satisfaction), some backstage celeb moments, and other little tidbits from both the pre-NYC shows as well as a few candid moments with Ian Stewart, Mick Jagger, and the Grateful Dead before Altamont. Lastly, there is a brief blues piano interlude from Keith that sounds exactly like those legendary Toronto tapes that were recorded many years later as he faced heroin charges and imprisonment. What price would you put on this rare footage?There are three cds, one being the original release. The secondary cd of the unreleased tracks from the MSG show fairly completes what has long been missing and available on other boots of the tour and features a particularly endearing flub during Prodigal Son. A common whine is that they should've released the entire show, chronologically without editing. For those ocd among you, search out the numerous bootleg sites on line and buy it yourself or mix these songs together and form your own one disc set, but quit crying already. Is it just me or are Stones fans the biggest complainers in the world? The third cd is the long overdue release of the opening acts. B.B. King is in fine form, easily as sharp and well-oiled as on Live at the Regal or at Cook County Jail. Although a short set, it's definitely something I'll be listening to often. Similarly, the brief Ike and Tina Turner portion is equally entertaining and the sizzling and sultry performance of I've Been Loving You Too Long loses nothing in the absence of her microphone stroking visual.Lastly, the other items include a postcard replica of the tour poster, a freebie download of a song for Guitar Hero 5 (don't own), and a hardcover mini-book with photos, an essay, and some fan notes. Nothing major, but goodies nonetheless.In summary, unlike so many packaged re-releases with supposed goodies and extras, the extra material herein is truly worthwhile and stands alone. There was not the option to simply get the bonus stuff without the additional copy of the original recording, so crying over what won't be is pointless. For me, this box is measured by the value herein and not so much by the price tag. Is it worth what it? That depends on how smart of a shopper you are.

This is a fantastic Aerosmith album wherein all their skills are brought together into one masterpiece of seventies hard rock. Encompassing the funky grooves that Perry and Kramer bring with them, Walk This Way and Adam's Apple make the record roll while No More, No More, Round and Round, Sweet Emotion, the title track, and Uncle Salty make it rock.I've never been too fond of their cover of Big Ten Inch Record, but it's a fan favorite and was pretty tongue in cheek. The ballad at the end is the best Tyler's ever done - even up to today's poppy rubbish. It's plaintive without being maudlin, the strings are perfectly utilized, and the coda is well done.No More No More and Sweet Emotion are two of the best songs in their extensive catalog, and the FM staple Walk This Way has shown how durable it is over the years. Tyler wrote some of his best lyrics, Perry, Hamilton, and Whitford put music to his prose, and you have Aerosmith at their best. A top 100 of all time in rock history.

I love this record! My friends and I bought this newly released 8-track on the way to seeing them in Pittsburgh in 1978 and, man, did we have a party that night! This is what the five ugly stoner guys of Aerosmith were to me - feedback soaked amps, screaming guitars, screeching vocals, shattering drums, thumping, seductive bass, and songs that are like a roller coaster ride off the edge of the map. This is it. Raw and unglossed (see: Nugent, Ted and Kiss), the cuts on this wonderful album are Aerosmith in their element at the right time in their careers. I don't care what the biographers or the historical revisionists say, even the band members themselves who seem averse to endorsing much from this era, THIS is the real deal.To be specific; Lord of the Thighs is killer, Dream On rivals the studio version's passion, the "tortured Strats" of Sweet Emotion and Sick As A Dog, and the frenzied Train Kept A Rollin.' You even get two "extras" (way before the cd era) in the 1973 tracks that show a band in their nascent years. Great stuff, indeed. The liner notes and photos are even cool.I can't give it five stars because there are still a few missteps. Specifically, Come Together and Chip Away The Stone. First, I don't understand their need or desire to cover Beatles songs (care to field this one, Mr. Tyler?), but it's just a bad match. If they want to cover a band, then quit the pretense and cover the Stones already. Seriously, can you think of a better song to cover for this band than the Stones' Monkey Man? Imagine Tyler handling the chorus on that number! As for the latter, the song is too poppy and lame for me and could've been replaced by a version of Same Old Song and Dance or Rats In The Cellar (or countless others). Other than that, it is their best live album for sure and it is a juicy slice of the greasy pie that was Aerosmith in all their dirty glory.Spark it up, pop on your headphones and your A-smith baseball jersey, and enjoy.

I really don't think I'd want to hear a group playing punk music past the age of 30 or so. The same can be said for X, a group that built a solid reputation on their short, pounding, punk epics about love amidst the decay of L.A. in the late 70s and early 80s. But, punk is as much about age and attitude as it is about musical skills (or lack thereof), and X was always far more talented than your average punk group of angry kids taking out their angst on instruments and writing odes to anarchy and getting hammered. X grew up, like we all have. Still, for many folks, X changed too much for their liking, starting with their problematic decision to go pop-metal and generate some long-awaited radio buzz. The follow-up to that mixed bag, "See How We Are" featured a new guitarist to replace the fleet-fingered but frustrated and burned-out Billy Zoom. Tony Gilkyson was the new axeman, a guy who had a solid resume including a stint with another L.A. band with a similar low sales/high buzz history, the short-lived Lone Justice. Probably the song where he stamps his unique style on the X format is on "Anyone Can Fill Your Shoes," a rocking riff-heavy song that, despite it all is nowhere near the X of "Year 1."This is an album that has been tagged with the "rootsy" label, although that really only shows up on a few songs and two of them are brilliant. The mild-hit "Fourth of July," co-written by another SoCal bud, Dave Alvin of the Blasters, and "See How We Are," one of my top twenty favorite songs of all time are highlights on this album. The title track is a painfully beautiful song that demonstrates why this band received so many accolades despite never achieving the radio success of far lesser bands. It is sparse, yearning, and bitter, mixing an acidic take on self-absorbed Americans with a tender apology to a lover. John and Exene's lyrical genius is all over this album and I particularly love "Surprise, Surprise" where Exene, lamenting a life on the road, cries in the wail that only she can deliver. X has always been keenly aware of where they stood in the music world and perhaps the critical acclaim that attached itself to this band from the get-go worked as salt in the wound when their albums failed to sell like their contemporaries who wrote pabulum-filled crap and couldn't hold a candle to the art they created. Despite years of love from the press and a hardcore audience of fans, the band still found itself playing small crowds and promoting themselves to a world that would largely never understand or appreciate them. It certainly would've been natural to wonder where their success was as they watched dopes like Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, or even The Go-Gos make millions.Nevertheless, in the retrospective narratives that go with the reissues, they seem to have made peace with their past and thankfully we have the music to listen to over and over. This cd, while uneven in places, still contains a handful of songs that are fantastic and shows the future trajectory of John Doe and Exene Cervenka as they headed towards solo careers over the next years.

Three Times is a highly acclaimed film from Hou Hsiao Hsien that involves three separate stories of love, each featuring actors Shu Qi and Chang Chen. In hindsight, they are not so much about love as they are about longing.The first part (A Time for Love) is a tender and utterly charming vignette about the pursuit of love set in 1966 Taiwan. Chen is a soldier who periodically returns to a pool hall to see the attendant there (Qi). The second part (A Time for Freedom) is a silent movie set in a brothel during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. The third part (A Time for Youth) is set in present day Taipei and involves a love triangle between Qi, her female lover, and Chang. It is a sad and bleak vision of love to say the least.The titles sum up each story as we have love that blooms in the first title but suffers under the sexual inequality of one era and the self-absorbed and nihilistic inherencies of another. All three pieces are short on dialogue and thus demand much of the viewer to observe and interpret.Qi is good throughout; sweet and shy, graceful and demure, or angst-ridden and self-destructive. Chen is given a bit less to work with, but he does a good job as the love interest, especially in the first part.It's hard to distinguish where my personal feelings of love start and where the stark yet genuine treatment of love from three different stories ends. I would say that there are times in my life when I would prefer each one. To that end, love as portrayed in Three Times starts out with great promise and hope, runs into obstacles, and then turns sour and dies. Furthermore, after such a wonderful beginning, it's fair to say that the movie leaves the viewer wanting so much more and feeling disappointed and cheated. Perhaps that is Hsien's intended commentary about love as a whole. I hope he's wrong.

I had been curious to view "Swingers" for many years but never got around to it until I found it for a few bucks at a local re-sale store. Being a fan of Vince Vaughn, I figured he would be worth the three dollars I dropped for this highly acclaimed indie flick. Man, do I want my money back!For starters, is there a main character less likable than Jon Favreau's weak Mikey? The pinnacle of dislike was the maddening scene where Mike calls a girl he just met about a dozen times, leaving more and more paranoid and desperate messages. What adult does this? I might expect this from a thirteen year old, but an adult? Thankfully, the girl bluntly asks him to never call again and we are relieved that the universe has taken its pound of flesh from this most disagreeable moron. Perhaps, in a better actor's care, this unlikeable character might've had a chance to engender some empathy, but in the hands of writer Favreau, he is an expressionless clod, schlepping his way through his purposeless life. As the writer of this mess, one can only assume that this was some vanity piece extraordinaire with the writer/lead envisioning himself as the hard-talking mug dealing with heartbreak over some dame....or words to that effect.Secondly, the dialogue is painfully ridiculous. While it's possible that people talked like this during the very brief retro movement in the nineties, I sincerely doubt they used their secret-club phrases as inexplicably often as they do here. I honestly began to wonder if there wasn't some drinking game associated with this movie wherein you chugged every time you heard the word "money" or a derivation of the word "baby," It's the only sensible explanation.Lastly, the movie gave me no reason to like any character in the movie. There were some brief moments when the character played by Office Space's Robert Livingston had something worthwhile to say and the character Lorraine (replete with her 40s name and 40s coif - one of the frequent and pandering tips of the fedora to the hip days of yore) seems to have potential, but that's it. Oddly enough, the one movie that this reminds me of as an example of how well you can do anti-heroes and periphery-dwelling people is Napoleon Dynamite. I almost wish that he would've appeared in this movie and replaced some of their painfully cool Scotch drinks with some bleach-tainted milk. It would've been the only funny thing in the movie. Maybe I could tolerate the utter lack of concern for anything beyond the next night's adventures if these were high school kids, but these are supposed to be men making their way in life and all they do is puff up their chests, try way too hard to be cool, and piss and moan about their love lives. They are little more than insipid male stereotypes.What about Vince Vaughn you ask? Well, try as he may to breathe life into his two dimensional role, he falls flat. The high point of the movie is his drunken take in the diner and that's only because you realize that you hate his character equally as much as the other self-indulgent stupid male clich&eacute;s. Guys get drunk. Guys scam on women. Guys play video games. Money, Baby! Ugh!!In summary, Favreau attempts to make a hip version of the Guys Being Stupid buddy movie. It's certainly a sub-genre full of possibilities but in "Swingers" it is little more than a boring, un-funny waste of time. It borrows unapologetically from many movies, from the Rat Pack vibe to the Woody Allen love-angst and through the "Diner" self-examinations, but skims only the surface and fails to support it with characters of interest, witty dialogue, or social/cultural observations. A bunch of guys go drinking in and around L.A., looking for sex, and talking about their job-less lives. How am I supposed to feel anything towards a bunch of guys who sponge off their parents while they waste their days playing Pitch n' Putt and ordering expensive drinks at Hollywood watering holes? Clearly, I didn't feel anything but contempt and frustration for the time I wasted with this self-indulgent garbage. Thankfully, I can take it back to the place I bought it from and trade it in for something else. This movie is awful.

I'm not the most qualified Siouxsie head out there, having only turned on to them with Hyaena, but this is an incredible piece of music. I don't want to label it with goth or synth pop or whatever, because it doesn't do the album justice. Suffice it to say that this has some of the most memorable, tight, and powerful songs I've ever heard. Each one is a well crafted jewel with piercing sounds, haunting melodies, and Siouxsie's unique brand of vocals; breathy, snarling, foreboding, sexy, dreamy, and always hypnotic. There are mental images, ala Pink Floyd, that come with each song, as if each is a movie soundtrack unto itself. Music that conjures up visual images is a rare find and this album has them from start to finish. I have listened to this countless times for decades now and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It doesn't get old and it does not have the dated quality of much that surfaced in the 80s. It has been called one of the more approachable records by this unusual and sadly underrecognized band, but know that there is much to like for any fan of good melody, keen lyrics, and well produced musical vignettes.

People are always saying that things were better "back then" and the sentiment increases with age. When it comes to Hollywood movies, things were most certainly better when the movie business didn't release so many movies or beat successful horses until every last original thought or joke devolves into boring and fatuous formula. Welcome to the career of Mike Myers.Maybe if the bulk of Myer's resume wasn't bullet-pointed with sequels and he hadn't showed us all the goodies in his comedy tool box; e.g., an entertaining mix of sophomoric innuendo, spot-on satire of genres, cheeky names, and the always-popular jokes regarding genitalia or bowel movements, he wouldn't have exhausted his repertoire and we wouldn't have to suffer through The Love Guru. This newest offering is as predictable as the jokes you see coming a mile away. Making it worse is that the premise isn't even that interesting. Like so many comedy movies released of late, there is a thread of a plot wrapped around ninety minutes of extremely tired jokes. The actors do their best and there are some smiles and mild chuckles, but most of it is just groan-inducing and expected.I really like Mike Myers and want to believe that he has some great movies left in him, but to take several years to come up with this yawn-fest makes me question my beliefs. Either he has to let go of the reins and work for someone else or he needs to enter the cryogenic chamber and shoot himself into outer space in a giant Big Boy vessel, returning only when the last of us who have seen his work and grown tired of it are no longer living.

Like a shopping list of all that is bad about Hollywood comedies, this movie seemed to have it all. Start with Seth Rogen and Jason Bateman - arguably the two most pervasive actors working today, add in some CGI and plenty of dope smoking and beer drinking, and toss in the well-worn buddy/road trip scenario. All that was missing was Judd Apatow's stamp of approval. The comparisons stop there, however, because that's the one conspicuously absent element in Paul.Paul completely took me by surprise as one of 2011's best as well as a downright keeper of a movie. Clever, quick paced, chock full of pop culture/sci-fi references, and funny, with a dash of sentiment and some of the most brilliant swearing in any movie ever, Paul is a perfect example of what Hollywood can do when it truly puts its collective head into something.Bateman goes a bit against type but Rogen is his same slacker self, as if the role was written specifically for him. This is the only negative about the movie, not because Rogen does a bad job, but because he is so over-exposed and the character of Paul is the least fulfilled of them all. Brit's Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (the movie is their idea and they demonstrate why cheeky is much more appealing than crude) do the heaviest lifting, but they are supported by a worthwhile cast. Notable is the cute and nave portrayal of a former Jesus Freak-turned swearing novice by Kristen Wiig (good enough to forgive the gender equality stupidity and puerility of Bridesmaids) and a warm and edgy Blythe Danner as the pivotal character who first makes extraterrestrial contact decades before. There's also a lovely surprise in the form of an obvious cameo.Paul not only makes you laugh, but it also brazenly skewers Christians fundamentalists (granted, that's like shooting fish in a barrel) and the whole geek culture of sci-fi with spot-on accuracy and nose-thumbing glee. Not bad at all for a movie that looked groaningly dumb during previews last year.Paul is good enough that it gives me strength to keep trying comedies in the hopes that I might once again come across a true needle in the haystack just like it. Definitely recommended.

I'm not so in touch with the history of the Clash as some of the reviewers nor am I into debating how best to pigeon-hole them, I just love this record! So many great songs, so many styles, how can one not enjoy at least some of these songs?The title track and it's follow-up Brand New Cadillac are a one-two punch that any band would love to have laid down. The songs bounce onward with amazing smoothness despite the stylistic differences of Hateful, Jimmy Jazz, the aforementioned two, Lost in the Supermarket, et al. One could talk about what it means to be punk but I always thought it was more an aesthetic issue opposed to some instrumental or songwriting shortcomings. Give me this over the ridiculous Sex Pistols any day.

In some ways reminiscent of The Story of Qiu Ju, Not One Less tells the story of a stubborn and nave person from the country adrift in an urban setting making maddeningly poor choices. Unlike the other movie however, Not One Less is about a thirteen year old makeshift substitute teacher in a rural school who sets off for the city to retrieve a student from her class. Through the course of the movie, her motives change from selfish to selfless and she does a tremendous amount of growing up in the days and weeks the movie takes place within.Played not by actors but by ordinary people and filmed in Yimou's no frills albeit stunningly gorgeous and evocative style, we witness the power of sheer determination and survival instincts bringing together a large community in a powerful display of humanity and compassion.Rant ahead: As a teacher, I have reminded my students many times of their great fortune in being born in America and having free education for all. I've even brought this point forward many times with their parents. Sadly, my words often fall on deaf ears because free public education is viewed like so many other things we've long taken for granted in our country that others throughout the world would practically kill to have. How is it that our country can be so far behind the rest of the world in education even as we provide twelve free years of it to every child? If your answer is to blame unions, bad teachers, and government bureaucracy, you're missing the biggest factor. We reap what we sow and our bountiful nation has produced lazy, spoiled, materialistic, self-absorbed brats, and I'm not just talking about our children. We do lead the world in self-esteem, however, so we are certainly proud of how fat, stupid, and selfish we are. Public education will never change in this country until the overall culture that has made us what we are today makes a dramatic turnaround.

There are moments in life, all-too-rare, when you experience something that becomes a part of your life because it somehow, inexplicably, touches your soul. Perhaps it is a painting, a novel, a song, or a movie. Last winter, someone recommended Am&eacute;lie to me. My life was changed the moment it started.As I watched, my heart cried, my soul opened wide, and I fell in love...with a movie. I mean, the whole movie; the colors, the actors, the words, the language, the story, and the music, oh the incredible music. It is pointless to explain the plot or get into specifics. How do you dissect pure beauty without detracting from its overall power?There are very few things I recommend to everyone I know, especially to those who I hold close to my heart. Am&eacute;lie is one of them. I plead with you - watch this movie.As I go through life as a divorced man in my forties I realize I have learned a lot about what it is that I would need from a partner. It isn't a long list, but the requirements are essential. One of them is that she must adore this movie.

I must have had this movie in my hands a few dozen times before I finally picked it up in a hasty moment recently. The reviews herein hit the nail pretty squarely and if you are wondering about it, please take note: THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE STONES.I know nothing of Jean-Luc Godard's work and have no desire to if this is indicative of his style. That's not a knock on him at all, just a definition of my own taste. That said, the Stones footage is priceless, especially is you are intrigued by what some might consider the mundane nature of composing a song. Keith has often confessed that the best songwriting of the band comes from what he calls a "marination" process and that is an apt description of how Sympathy for the Devil is created in the footage from the studio we are treated to. The film captures this fascinating process as the song progresses and transforms. Highlights along the way are Keith's seemingly off-the-cuff riffing that mirror the final stinging solo of the recording, the keyboard morphing from organ to the more classic piano, and the percussion component ending with the now classic work from Rocky Dijon. It was like being a fly on the wall and proved mesmerizing to me.However, if you are inpatient with the interwoven parts of the film that the back cover calls "political cartoons" and find it too tedious to sift through, I would strongly advise renting before owning. Interestingly enough, I found Gimme Shelter far more frustrating because much of the Stones footage in that movie was focused on Jagger exclusively. In this movie, we are treated to a broad canvas and get to see everyone, including Brian Jones, contributing. Many slag off his part in the process, but I think he was doing his best and was not nearly as "out of it" as many reviewers have stated.Five stars for the Stones, minus two for the rest, that's the final rating of three.

I enjoy the work of Bill Murray very much and The Razor's Edge is my favorite book of all time, so I came into this movie with very high hopes, albeit some reservations that Bill Murray would be able to put aside that which makes him so endearing and play a role that calls for gravitas unlike he's ever shown capable. Nonetheless, I owe the discovery of this book (and author) to Murray, because I'd read of his desire to make the movie back in the early 80s and it created enough curiosity in me to read the book prior to the movie's arrival.Bill did well in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation because those roles allowed enough flexibility for the irreverence and class clownishness that is his stock in trade. As Larry Darrell, a man seeking meaning in life, Murray sadly falls short of the mark. Instead of playing a damaged man seeking purpose and enlightenment, he comes across as a guy who chooses simplicity over wealth; granted a part of the process, but not the end all. Thus, Murray's Darrell seems superficial in his spirituality.In fact, the only character who seems well cast is Denholm Elliott as the snobbish socialite Elliott Templeton, who narrates the novel and gives critical perspective. Unfortunately, he's wasted and relegated to only half of his character's capacity in this movie, and played more for laughs than anything else. Theresa Russell nails the bitter and tragic Sophie, but unfortunately never allows us to see Sophie's initial mild-mannered naivet&eacute;.Ironically enough, the information I've read from other reviewers is that Murray went into a bit of a funk after this movie bombed. His suffering may have brought him a clarity and wisdom he hadn't yet attained with his superstar fame in the early 80s. That a better version of this movie may have been possible only after Murray failed in his initial attempt is profundity fitting Larry's search.If this movie leads you to Maugham and this powerful book, then that merits at least a viewing, so I can't say that I don't recommend it. I will only admit to disappointment that The Razor's Edge failed to deliver the power I experienced in reading this most beloved novel.

Wow, was this a dull movie. I'll cut to the chase - I watch movies to be entertained. If I want to take a scenic tour, I'll watch the Travel Channel. This movie is one long boring set-up to an underwhelming ending that leaves one feeling like they'd wasted far too much time on this soundtrack-heavy warmed-over 80's style re-envisioning. Colin Farrell is plodding and emotionless, save the narrow band of feelings conveyed when he opens his eyes wide, Jamie Foxx is wasted with banal cop talk, and the movie, which tries unsuccessfully to convey the empty pointless angst of the tv show, ends up being an utterly tired cliche of a movie. Perhaps most heinous, the remarkably talented Gong Li is utterly miscast and thus wasted. Maybe some day she'll get a starring vehicle in a Hollywood film (her role in Memoirs of a Geisha was secondary) that will truly show western audiences her talents, but for now we have to suffer through crap like this.There was no one you cared for in the movie, nothing new to show (South American drug dealers? Holy Creativity Batman!), and even the action scenes (way too few) and sex scenes (ditto) are sterile and sleep inducing. There is nothing to enjoy in this movie that you couldn't find in a dozen other more entertaining movies. Save your money and rent a good thirty-year old Kung Fu movie or one of the offerings from Li's extensive and far more worthwhile resume instead.

Like that other great, dead rock star Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison has had his legacy grow beyond even the mythic status it was when he was alive. Like Hendrix, Jimbo created an image that became a crippling anchor around his neck. Doomed by his own vanity and the trappings of success, he died too young and left behind a scattershot collection of writings, recordings, and other works that have been ravenously picked over, packaged, and re-packaged for the greed and notoriety of the remaining band members. The recent deluge of live concerts, some so embarrassing one wonders just how far greed will go given the appetite of the Morrison faithful, and the senseless re-mastering of their studio catalog to the exclusion of the originals (all of which are "currently unavailable" on Amazon) demonstrate that there is no limit to the manner in which a seemingly limited body of work can be parsed and re-treaded ad nauseum to keep the money train rolling. I often wonder what Hendrix, Morrison, et al would think of the handiwork of those whom they left behind. I'm guessing they'd be ashamed and angry and they'd have every right to be.And so, The Doors In Concert...as many reviews have stated, this is a combination platter of Alive She Cried and Absolutely Live with two extra cuts tacked on from the Hollywood Bowl concert. Absolutely Live is worth the price on it's own and the addition of the posthumous release Alive She Cried, a well done compilation of songs from various shows over the years, makes owning this comprehensive live document worth the extra few bucks. You get it all, Jim's audience manipulation, the tight blues and jazz vibe of the musicians, and the poetry. The songs provide a solid argument that Jim's best "poetry" was lyrics. Hearing his writings, particularly the complete Celebration of the Lizard piece, sung and set to music and delivered in Morrison's deep croon is truly the way it should be experienced. Reading his poetry without the music and the baritone delivery, as can be done via his poetry collections, only highlights the pretension and disconnected inconsistencies of his writings. The death obsessed macabre rambling in the live version of The End that closes disc two is neither brilliant nor deep, it's just silly and juvenile. Hey, I'm in my twenties and fascinated by death...don the black clothing and light some patchouli quick before I become self-aware. Honestly, I think Morrison himself, had he shook off his puerile need to drink himself to death and made it to his sixtieth birthday would be exceedingly embarrassed at his own overly dramatic and painfully overzealous tripe.If it sounds like I'm knocking the group, I'm not at all. I love the Doors - the band - and I think Morrison was a great front man. This is a great live album well worth five stars and the price tag. But let's face it, as a poet Jim Morrison was one helluva great lead singer.

I saw this when it was released and then recently bought it and watched it again and was not disappointed either time. It moves fast, has some funny moments, is over-the-top at all times, and is silly, juvenile, and predictable. But, I liked it. It's a movie you just watch for fun, not to criticize. Believe me, there are far more mega-hyped movies that have come out over the last ten years or so that were no better. The last two Austin Powers movies, Blades of Glory, pretty much anything with Jim Carrey post-Liar, Liar, and the majority of Jack Black and Ben Stiller offerings. This received a fair amount less pimping and was just as funny. Many have compared Daniel Folger to Jack Black and I don't get it. Why? Because they're both big guys? Black is Robin Williams subtle, Folger plays it a bit more low key and it works much better in this role. George Lopez won't make you forget Marlon Brando, but so what? The movie is funny, quick moving, and is a good way to spend a little time in front of the idiot box. It isn't called that for nothing, you know.

The third installment of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations dvd collection continues his travels around the world including a fair amount of U.S. destinations. I prefer the more philosophical adventures he has and the food-centric ones are understandable as it is his forte. The only episode issues I have are the trivial and generic ones, such as his visit to South Carolina. It is a tired exploration of the clich&eacute;d Southern hospitality, replete with a fox chase, garden party, Civil War re-enactment, and various other good-ole-Southern-charm fluff that is straight from Samantha Brown's itinerary. There are too many travel shows and food network garbage that specialize in this kind of shallow fare and it is a disappointment to see this from No Reservations. I understand the corporate push to broaden the market, but stuff like this never seems to be a good fit for Bourdain. Thankfully, the South Carolina show is the weakest of a strong bunch, thirteen in all.The always fun Zamir adventure takes place in Russia and there are three trips to Southeast Asia including the frantic and food loving paradises of Singapore and Hong Kong. There is also an episode billed as Shanghai, but it is more an exploration of western China than the city per se and is one of the better inclusions on the collection. There is a funny trip back to a disappointingly clean and family-friendly New York then there is the piece de resistance of the collection; a brilliant graphic novel themed trip to Cleveland featuring American Splendor author Harvey Pekar and a cast of characters. Thankfully, Tony went there in the dead of winter and got the full-on Lake Erie wind chill joy that life in that city entails. Other episodes are Berlin, Tuscany, Brazil (Sao Paolo), and Argentina. Along with Cleveland and Shanghai, is one of my favorites. It targets French Polynesia and weaves a connective thread to Paul Gaugin, eschewing the tropical paradise predictability.As with the previous collections in this series; these discs come without commentary, deleted scenes, or any other extras. Furthermore, the contents don't seem to jibe with what I've seen listed on other sites as being from season three per se. My guess is that the chopped up broadcasting schedule which airs a handful during one period than another group some months later creates confusion as to when one season ends and another begins. To be fair, the dvd box does say "collection" and not "season," so there seems to be a method to their compilation, although I don't know what that is.When No Reservations truly excels, it goes beyond a travel show or a food show and become more of a sociological and anthropological exploration. Bourdain seeks to find out what makes a community tick, what keeps people staying in places that often seem bleak and hopeless to the typical over-indulged American viewer, and what unites humanity on a sociological and cultural level. He does his historical homework and sits down with the people he meets to get at the heart of who they are and how they define themselves. By avoiding the tourist frivolity and focusing instead on the anthropological development as seen from the very people who shaped or have been shaped by it, we are provided with more than pretty sites and mouthwatering food. We are given a small sampling of the kind of deeper exploration of new places and new people that is truly at the heart of why those of us who have the travel bug aren't likely to be found in the obvious places. It is through this lens of higher level thought-provocation and contextual examination that we are able to see not only what makes one place different from another, but moreover, what makes it all the same. I'm confident you'll enjoy the trip. Bon voyage.

This movie is not razor-sharp satire, it is blunt instrument bludgeoning satire. This is a take-no-prisoners assault on the state of the union and it pours a flood light on the underbelly of American culture and society. There is plenty to admire about Mike Judge's message and even more to admire about how he doesn't give a damn about offending those who helped make him popular, i.e. the Beavis and Butthead crowd. Just as many didn't get the joke of Beavis and Butthead and instead of laughing at these moronic teens they looked to them as role models, there will be plenty who see Judge's future and droolingly mutter, "Cool!! Gatorade water fountains!"Like Office Space, it bogs down a bit, but it also similarly makes enough funny bulleyes to more than make up for the down time. Be prepared to laugh but also be prepared to chagrin a bit when you see some of yourself, scro.

I think this is Jeff Beck's finest recording. A notch better than its predecessor and a more comfortable fit than many of the other formats this experimental guitar hero has tried, Wired seems to fit his frantic guitar runs, his sonic bends, his unique phrasing, and his sweet-hot tone like a glove. It is doubtless due in part to the instrumental nature that this album stands above the rest. Beck doesn't have to battle a vocalist; he simply steps into the spotlight and wails. Rod Stewart came close, but in the end, none of those singers could keep up with him or give him the Plant to the Page that so many other musical acts have. He was simply too good for anyone to sing along with him. Rather than play tired pop songs or try to make something work within that formula, he chose to move into the world that best suited him - instrumental music.There are some of his better known songs such as Led Boots and Blue Wind, but it is the quieter moments, such as Love is Green or Charles Mingus' Goodbye Pork Pie Hat, that I enjoy equally as much. Another feather in the cap for this cd is the stellar backing musicians that make these songs leap out of your speakers. This cd is pure listening pleasure.In an outtake included in the re-issue of Beck-Ola, Beck does his take on B.B. King's "Sweet Little Angel." Therein, he plays with such fury that it literally sounds as if he is strangling his guitar; choking notes out of it that are far from the pentatonic parameters that most blues guitar work stays within. In that showcase number, it is clear that the blues is far too limited for him, as was the soul/r & b flavored phase that followed it. It was with this foray into the free-form of jazz that Beck shines brightest. I see in Beck's career arc the same route that Jimi Hendrix might have taken, and Wired is arguably the apex. Perhaps it is a blessing in disguise that Beck never achieved the popularity of his peers, for in so doing, they painted themselves into corners which were difficult to escape from. No one will ever accuse Beck of selling out in his career or falling into a rut because he has always been more of a restless genius than a disciple of a genre.If there is one Jeff Beck album to own or start with, I recommend this one. If your jaw doesn't drop after a few songs, I don't really know when it would.

I am amazed at how many reviewers said things like "I couldn't put it down!" or some such thing. In my case, I TOILED over this book, rarely reading it with any voracity, instead plodding along hoping for something, that magic moment when I would get the reason why so much frothing adoration is heaped upon it. After 500 pages or so, it became a personal challenge to finish it so I wouldn't feel as if I'd wasted so much time!Yes, there is a complex plot and there are many details of the differences between cultures, however the whole west meets east and philosophical epiphanies abound approach is tired and condescending. I get the concept as does every gai-jin to spend time in Japan or anyone who has ever taken the time to explore the other half of the globe. Couple that problem with the fantasty cliche of the Westerner falling in love with the mysterious exotic Japanese beauty and the near lurid obsession with sex and you get a novel that is far too long, far too superficially reverent, and far too contrived. It is not horrible but neither is it a masterpiece of fiction. I would rather read something vastly shorter or at least compelling enough to justify the amount of time one puts into this brick of a book. Thud.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised at so many rave reviews for this movie, but I thought it was a real let-down. One reviewer asks us to "let down our expectations." Why? Why shouldn't I expect the same quality that the folks used for the first two? It isn't as if they don't have the time, money, or skills - not to mention forty years of comic books to browse for story lines. If anything I should keep my expectations high all the time. Why do we get crappy films? Because we have lowered expectations, that's why.This movie has too many bad guys, too much of a downright silly plot, shameful under utilization of entertaining characters (J.J.J.) in favor of smarmy ones (Eddie Brock/Venom) and veers back and forth between parody and seriousness to utter distraction. Perhaps the worst offense is that by the end of the movie, you just don't care about Peter Parker/Spider-Man. What a shame.In addition, this movie was a drag because it lacked any good action sequences, and for that matter, not enough action sequences period and it had WAY too much drama. The fight scenes were so fast and so hard to follow that I found myself wondering what was going on and the drama was so contrived and cliched that I simply didn't care. It is indeed a long fall from the spectacular train fight sequence and the simple agonizing romance of Peter and M.J. in the second movie to the nauseating action and embarassingly maudlin scenes in this film.I truly hope that they either stop this series now or go back to the first two movies and really study what made them so good. This is NOT the best in the series, in fact it is by far the worst. As a matter of fact, I thought Ghost Rider was better. Does that tell you something?

So far, I have hung a few things (nothing too heavy) and this product works well. It is easy enough to cut and dispense as I need, holds steady and firm, and did not tear the paper I had it affixed to when I went to move it. It moved cleanly and left no marks. Instead of using tacks that leave marks, use this product to stick items to surfaces without destroying the surface or the product you are displaying.

This is a movie I could watch once a week and always laugh out loud (as well as always replay the dog over the bridge scene for extra laughs). There are more outrageously bizarre and side-splittingly funny moments in this movie than any I can think of, and after four plus decades on planet earth (you stay classy...), I've seen a lot. The entire cast is brilliant, the satire gleefully over-the-top, and the plot, well, are you really curious about a plot? Who cares? Check your prudishness at the door and get ready to choke on your popcorn and spit-take your beverage as this movie will make you laugh your breathtaking hiney off. This is one of those Caddyshack-type movies that will have you dropping lines from it and getting the knowing winks and follow-up lines from those who have seen it as well. It is the gift of laughter to get for yourself or those who have a sense of humor that does not involve gentle mews of joy but loud guffaws of bombastic pleasure. If you don't find at least a half dozen solid belly laughs in this movie, then I don't think I want to know what you find funny.By the way, the special features are funny, too, and numerous. Good stuff all the way around. Get it, laugh, and make your world a funnier place.

So many people slag this album off and I can't understand why, beyond pack mentality. If for no other reason, why this one and not "Undercover," which is similar and lacks some of the really good songs included on "Dirty Work," such as "Winning Ugly," "One Hit (To The Body)," "Too Rude," and "Sleep Tonight?" Whatever the reason, this isn't at all the awful mess that so many say it is and it is certainly no worse than "It's Only Rock and Roll," "Between the Buttons," or anything that has come out after it. In fact, this album and "Undercover" lay the ground work for the Stones sound to come, the only difference being those two albums were actually, well, ALBUMS, and therefore did not have an additional twenty minutes of filler crap crammed onto the vinyl.It's a shame that so much of the Amazon reviews are little more than mutual love societies wherein all works are lauded regardless, dissension is trashed and dissenters ganged up on, and so little time seems spent on critically writing about the content. You either have the aforementioned THIS IS GREAT! fawning, coupled with the detailed "out of ten" song by song ratings, with no song garnering less than an 8.5, and/or the historical data reviewers who feel the compulsion to regurgitate their consumed trivia upon the masses.This is an album that sounds a bit unpolished, something their current releases could use a bit more of, rocks all the way through until the closing Keef song - a song, mind you, that marks possibly his last decent singing effort, and has some of the most personal lyrics they've ever recorded. Along the way you have the requisite riffs, hard rockers, some surprises, and a very few duds. It is edgy, brisk, and in your face, in short, the Rolling Stones. Yeah, the history surrounding Jagger/Richards often overshadows the actual material, and that's a shame. If I put cuts of this cd in a mix with other more "popular" Stones numbers, I guarantee most of the haters would be tapping their toes without missing a beat.

The batting average for album perfection has to be low across the board because there are rarely more than a few records in any artist's canon that are perfect from start to finish (psycho fans aside) and this problem is only exascerbated by adding more songs and thus more places to trip up short of the perfect finish line. A wise reviewer hit the nail on the head when they remark that this album is the last of the vinyl era (as well as Bill's last studio stand) and is therefore shorter than their more recent efforts which tend to be about three to six songs too long.That said, this album is really enjoyable and has more entertaining songs than can be found on the two follow-ups before you reach A Bigger Bang. While the meager studio output of the last few decades is an issue in and of itself, I'll let that go as Stones fans need to take what we can get at this stage in the game.The lyrics aren't as in your face as Dirty Work, perhaps because this was a album of reconciliation between Mick and Keith, but it detracts from Mick's usually sharp tongue. Even Mixed Emotions from the title on down is a pretty tepid offering on their relationship. It smacks more of resignation than anything else as if Mick has simply come to grips with the ironclad marriage he has with his partner in crime. The anger coursing through Dirty Work added to the overall intensity and punky vibe, but this one is a bit more of a pop flavored collection that is nonetheless upbeat with clean and riff rich melodies and danceable grooves. Rock in a Hard Place, Slipping Away, Break the Spell, Can't Be Seen, and Almost Hear You Sigh are some of the highlights.

Fortunately, I picked up this book at a discount table in a book store because anything you can read in a few hours at best is hardly worth the original cover price. That's what libraries are for. However, for the cheap price I paid and the fact that I can pass it on to others, I think it's well worth it.Content-wise, it's Bill Maher. I mean, you either are familiar with the guy or you best be before you buy his book. Scathing, unflinching, blunt, and irreverant are just a few adjectives that come to mind when trying to describe this book. It is funny although not drop dead funny, but rarely is Bill anyway. He is more a thoughtful funny. His opinions will bother plenty of people and that's what makes him so valuable. He isn't out to win the Nobel Prize, but he does a mighty fine job of pointing out the things that need pointed out, exposing the hypocrites, and calling things what they really are. Curiously enough, many of the same people who decry political correctness dislike this guy who practically defines the opposite. The reason? He includes their pet causes and beliefs in his thoroughly incorrect manner.Bill Maher is a necessary person in America today. To that end, please make sure his membership to the Playboy Mansion stays current and that the supply of premium dope to his house doesn't get interrupted.

The Cooler is one of those movies that isn't afraid to show Vegas for what it is, a huge illusion hiding an ugly and ultimately empty core. I dislike Las Vegas for many reasons, and I'll admit that some aren't fair. However, I do know a fraud when I see one and I do believe beyond a doubt that Las Vegas perfectly represents America's good (capitalism at its rawest), bad (the Disney-fied casinos), and ugly (the tourists). It's funny that whenever I have travelled or met people from other countries, the one city in America that makes them salivate more than any other is Las Vegas. Even foreigners seem to know that Las Vegas is where gluttony, greed, sex, and utter irresponsibility reign supreme. Even the insipid slogan begs you to go there and do all the stupid things you'd never even think about doing in your hometown. Las Vegas is ground zero for obedient drones to act out their most ridiculous fantasies guilt free. If only it were that easy...The Cooler isn't so much about Las Vegas, however, as much as it is about two beat-up people trying to escape it. Nonetheless, the writers hit several solid base hits when they attack the "Epcot" that new Vegas aspires to, overrun with flip-flop wearing, buffet gorging, self-satisfied pigs, guzzling oversized plastic cups of margaritas while dodging the porn card clicking illegals on every street corner of the Strip. It delivers a beautiful and long-overdue kick in the groin to the well-crafted illusion that Las Vegas is about anything other than taking every cent from you that it can. In short, there are no winners in Vegas, only saps who leave their comfortable cul-de-sac homes for a week's worth of sanitized debauchery and then head home to confession and the banality of their lives. The real Las Vegas is a sprawling, soul-less desert mess where everybody is tied in some way to the monster that demands to be fed.The veracity of that portrayal, admittedly subtle at times, is one of the qualities of this stark and sometimes graphic movie. There is wicked violence, sweaty sex, and ugly characters by the truckload. Just like Vegas! And the main three actors; Alec Baldwin, Maria Bello, and William H. Macy are all brilliantly cast. There are some interesting plot twists, particularly with an ending that has a hint of Coen Brothers randomness. But more than anything else, this is an often touching tale of two people who have been dealt one bad hand after another, yet somehow cling to hope and love.Come for the Vegas, stay for the people! Now there's an advertising slogan I'd think the natives would appreciate more. They'd certainly have less vomit to clean up.

I have no problem with greatest hits packages, but when they butcher the songs with 45 editing, you get half-ass versions of songs that were meant to be heard in their entirety.Add to this poor decision that they included two songs that need not be here, Kings and Queens and the ridiculous Remember (Walking In The Sand). There are at least a dozen others songs that deserve to be included here.All that aside, if you really want to introduce yourself to this band, buy Toys In The Attic or Rocks or one of the other scads of hits packages they've greedily dumped on the consumer over the years.Save your money.

I read through the reviews and found all of the various interpretations of this complex movie to be valid. Still, I don't know what to believe! However, it doesn't detract too much from the film unless you need some concrete plot and a linear storyline. I picked this up for two bucks in a Big Lots (sorry Amazon) and consider it a hidden gem. There is much to savor in this movie, from the controlled acting to the breathtaking scenery to the philosophical jewels scattered here and there. I think my favorite was the line "a lover is a mirror that allows us to see who we really are" or words to that effect - I apologize for the lack of a photographic memory. It is because of moments like these that I sat through this slow-moving tale and would do so again. This is a great movie to see with your own mate as it might provide some wonderful opportunities to chat and discover yourself in the mirror of your lover.

I came across Shaolin at a used movie shop yesterday and it was quite a great find. There is breathtaking action, heart-wrenching drama, thoughtful spirituality, and gorgeous cinematography of China. The movie is not a pure action romp nor is it a period-piece costume drama. It brings the best elements of both however, as well as elements that made some of the great crossover hits like Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and House of Flying Daggers so great. There are perfectly placed laughs, tender moments of love and loss, and brutal scenes of cruelty. Being that it is a story of Shaolin monks battling external forces, there are also many philosophical nuggets to be mined, and I found these welcome and moving treasures.Andy Lau does a great job portraying the general whose life is transformed and I've not seen Jackie Chan used so perfectly in a long while, if ever. Moreover, the characters are given depth and unexpected trajectories that were a refreshing break from the predictable.The movie clocks in at slightly over two hours and paces itself well. Additionally, it contains nearly forty-five minutes of deleted scenes including some poignant scenes and sub-plots that would've made the movie that much better. It was a smart decision to include them and give the viewer the chance to see a larger and more fully developed vision.If you are a fan of epic historical-action-dramas, I highly recommend Shaolin to you.

It's hard to review Jeff Beck because while his guitar work is never short of amazing, the genre and/or the material may not always be a match for his spectacular level of skill. So it is with this album. If you like your Beck rocking with soulful vocals, then by all means, this is your cup of tea. The singing is not my favorite part of this recording because I think Bob Tench reaches a bit too far and sounds a bit strained, but the style of the music itself is okay. The musicians are good enough and some of the songs are really good and make you wonder how in the world Jeff Beck never became a household name. Seriously - ask the casual music fan about Jeff Beck and see how many people answer, "But I didn't know that Beck guy had a first name..." The record starts off promisingly enough with Cozy's drum intro and the fun rocking "Ice Cream Cakes" and ends with a beautiful piece that hints strongly of the Blow by Blow world Jeff was headed towards. In between is a mixed bag of songs including the minor radio hit "Goin Down," which despite the lack of any kind of lyrical content, manages to capsulize Jeff's chops pretty neatly. Throughout this record, like all of Jeff's work, you have the man's guitar playing - the tone, the whammy induced howls and growls, the lightning fast hammer ons and pull offs, the hyper-sonic bends, and the rest of the arsenal this genuine guitar hero packs. If you don't care how your Beck is served up, you probably already own this. If you are more choosy about the accompaniment, listen to some samples and see if you care for this seventies rock and soul sampler.

I picked this book up shortly after finishing another Hollis book called "Why Good People Do Bad Things." I was so impressed by that book that I wanted to delve further into Hollis' Jungian take on life and I was not disappointed."The Middle Passage" examines many of the same concepts but focuses more on that time in our life when we seem to seek meaning with greater desperation than when we were younger. It really is a special time and this book encourages the reader to not only celebrate the gifts this milestone in life provides, but to furthermore seize the opportunities to re-define ourselves on our own terms and once and for all destroy the roots of angst and frustration.This book helps make sense of the jumble of conflicted emotions, duplicity, and self-destructiveness that lingers in all of us and comes to an ugly head during this transitional phase of life. Understanding why and what is the most beneficial tool that Hollis provides, and armed with it, I can dissect myself with the precision and sense of purpose that had heretofore been little more than shouts into the void and the maddening cycle of failure. As a teacher, I can appreciate the value in being given the chance to help myself instead of being provided with water-downed solutions that build no independence and problem-solving skills. Hollis does just that and I will forever be indebted to his wealth of understanding of the human psyche and his willingness to share it with the rest of us.The seeds Hollis plants demand painful and thorough self-analysis to bear fruit. The look within might be too frightening for many or simply too difficult for those seeking soft answers and blankets of comfort instead of chilling realities. If you are ready to take the journey or are already down the path and finding yourself a bit lost, use this psychological map. It bears repeating of the clich&eacute; that you can not know where you are going if you don't know where you've been.

Last Chance Harvey was a movie that was equal parts uncomfortable and sad as well as uplifting and hopeful. The beginning was very difficult to watch as we are introduced to the main characters via their painfully dull, lonely, and self-defeating lives. Kate is a poll taker in an airport and Harvey is a jingle writer fighting for his job. Single, lonely, and socially inept, these two happen to run into each other through the circumstances of plot and the movie begins to finally pick up.If fact, the movie seems to bottom out just before it picks up, exactly as the lives of these characters do. I was close to stopping it, I'll be very honest. Watching Dustin Hoffman's Harvey play out his schleppy downtrodden life was cringing. Thompson's Kate is a bit less grating, but either way, the director goes to great lengths to let you know that these are two thoroughly defeated people.After their second meeting, the two strike up a relationship and therein the movie begins the redemptive part. There was genuine warmth and a sense of hope finally blooming for these two sad people. I felt the ending was tacked on, however, and that the movie could've ended ten or fifteen minutes earlier without the forced tension and syrupy ending, but that's Hollywood.Last Chance Harvey has some very good observations about marginalized dads in divorce that spoke to me with bitter honesty. Furthermore, there are salient points about remorse over life choices, as well as how easy it seems to retreat to our miserable world for the sheer but sad comfort of it. Using older people was necessary as credulity would've been strained otherwise. I had to believe that these two people had fallen so far below the radar that getting back into life would seem uncomfortable and difficult.While not perfect, this movie was good enough to certainly rent and then see about purchasing it from there. I picked up my copy used for a few dollars and it is worth the small price tag. It's predictable but also satisfying.

Seeking Justice is, at times, a suspenseful if also fairly implausible and poorly acted movie. Nicholas Cage is merely passable in the role of the man-in-too-deep character, Guy Pearce is flat as a smooth talking bad guy, and January Jones is tepid as the victim/wife. I never felt engaged in the characters and this made the hundred minutes or so seem longer despite some fairly quick pacing once the movie turned from suspense to action.On the whole, the flat acting, a shortage of truly unique twists, inexplicable scenes (the Superdome....why??), and an unsatisfying end left me feeling disappointed in Seeking Justice. It's not an awful movie by any means, but it's not anything I'd care to see a second time. I'd not recommend buying it until after you've had a chance to see it for free on cable.

While sometimes not meeting prior expectations yields a real diamond in the rough; with Be Kind Rewind, it's more like finding a dollar on the sidewalk. It's nice but it won't do much for you. The premise is interesting but there are simply too many plot holes to make it seem believeable and not enough laughs to make you not care. What you have is a slow moving "little" movie, cute at times, with good intentions and a good turn by Mos Def, but not much else. There are some humorous moments in the sweded movies but the artificially sweet ending rang hollow and the rest of the cast were pretty average. View before buying, unlike what I did which was to impulse buy it with the predictable remorse. A movie like this will be selling for under five bucks before long so just wait it out.

This book reminds me of another cinder block epic about a heroic white guy in an eastern country, that book being Shogun. Both were full of new discoveries, strange worlds, and various epiphanies about life and how others view it and live it. Additionally, both were heavy on clich&eacute;s, white heroes in foreign lands, and disappointing endings. Not coincidentally, Gregory David Roberts' massive roman &agrave; clef left me with the same mixed feelings I had for Clavell's door stop. Most of the less favorable reviews have harped on the same points: the book is far too long, Roberts' style can be painfully verbose, tedious, and sophomoric, and the character Lin becomes increasingly more unsavory and his exploits less believable to sustain the reader's interest.Specifically, Roberts rambles on so often and for so long that what are initially very observant and occasionally poignant passages, soon morph into tiresome philosophical ramblings that are reduced to fortune cookie pabulum due to their constant infusion in the text. Further, the main character Lin is a sympathetic hard-luck guy in the beginning, but by the midpoint of the story he has turned into a Hollywood action hero and Roberts/Lin is compelled to constantly remind us of how amazing his life story has been and how selfless, understanding, courageous, thoughtful, and thoroughly bad-ass he is. Even when he tries to play up his weaknesses; the self-doubt, the abandonment of his family, his addictions, etc., it's remarkably devoid of lessons learned. This is not a tale of redemption despite what Roberts intended, but rather an unending fish tale.Despite the faults, however, the story does read pretty well at times. He paints a vivid and enticing portrait of India, an even more remarkable job considering the parts of that country where much of the story takes place. As has been widely agreed upon, the first third of the book is very engaging. I would've loved this book if it had simply stopped after he set up his slum infirmary, but unfortunately, that's not even half way through. Make no mistake; he has indeed lived a stunning life. Merely reading the back cover will have your jaw drop a little. And yet, that's the problem. Roberts' ego and fascination with his own life refuse to yield to editing and that's where this book fails the reader. He cashes in the goodwill he spent several hundred pages cultivating and, by the end, I felt his character had long overstayed his visit and had now become a self-aggrandizing boor. What could've been something special and life-affirming ended up leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. I felt emotionally betrayed by the author. To spend so much time cultivating a beautiful flower only to piss on it is a huge waste.It's hard to recommend a book that is nearly a thousand pages long because the investment needed is so great. It's one thing to read a novel of a few hundred pages and find out you didn't care for it. It's quite another to spend hours and weeks and perhaps months trying to get through a book that doesn't have that much to say and could've easily said it with far fewer words.

I've never been a big fan of Mickey Rourke. I always thought he was more sideshow buffoon than legitimate talent. That he squandered whatever skill he had with forays into boxing and his battles with various toxins is irrelevant. The plain truth is that there were no movies where I thought he played outside of himself and I was never impressed with the guy's work. I still feel that way. Nonetheless, The Wrestler is the perfect vehicle for him. This is acting as reality show and Rourke consumes the role of Ram, the washed up wrestler. The wheezing, grimacing, limping, pondering, seething, self-destructive role and actor often seem one and the same. Rourke pulls off the performance of a lifetime, largely because he is given a role so close to his own reality. What variances the original script had from Rourke's life were augmented at his request to better complete the picture. Don't misunderstand me; Mickey Rourke isn't alone in the Hollywood casting agency of stereotyped personalities, endlessly repeating their signature moves. Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino are all great actors, but all-too-often they fall back on their bag of tricks. Rourke isn't nearly as talented as those giants, but it doesn't matter. Like all the legends of screen, he found the definitive signature role.Marisa Tomei was the real gem of the story for me, however. Tomei showed courage in playing a character that is nude in most of her scenes and she delivers a brilliant performance. Enduring the merciless taunts or the hurtful disinterest from the crowd she attempts to entertain with the most basic tools, she demonstrates the vulnerability and fragile nature of such a career. Both Rourke and Tomei are performers past their shelf life because their success is based so exclusively on the acceptance of their bodies by a fastidious public. These are people trying to find themselves between the persona under which they perform and the reality that confronts them when the spotlight is shut off. Rourke played a role that mirrored his own near-tragic career path, but Marisa Tomei is the real actor here, playing a character that few actresses would have the fearlessness to accept and one that it is safe to say is far from her personal life.The Wrestler is an exceptional study in damaged individuals who lead lives far from the norm. The problem, as Rourke's Ram puts it, is that the real world doesn't care about them beyond the stage. Both suffer in their personal lives because they can't balance one with the other. Robin can't stop being Ram, to the detriment of his relationship with his daughter and Pam can't put aside Cassidy long enough to distinguish between the customer and the man who truly cares for her. The ending is expertly ambiguous because who can say what these sad characters will do next? It's just as easy to imagine the worst as it is to imagine a happy ending. And that's the reality of life.

Shame is a disturbing and painful movie to watch for many reasons, not the least of which may be the mirror it holds up to us. In a slow, quiet, and uninhibited style, director Steve McQueen takes us into the life of Brandon, a successful Manhattan-ite, and his ne'er do well sister, two tormented souls who might just as easily be seen as two sides of the same coin. Brandon is sterile and emotionally vacant and Sissy is a raging co-dependent whose emotions are always boiling at the surface. Both address their emotional issues with sex, Sissy hoping that every new encounter brings her the caretaker she so desperately needs and Brandon seeking only the cold anonymous release.The movie is intense, not so much for the sex (although it isn't going to be to everyone's taste), but rather because it forces us to look at how we deal with our own issues. It might make us feel better to delineate between "addicts" and the rest of us, but this is merely semantics. Putting a tag on someone because it distances their behavior from yours doesn't make you superior. Shame demonstrates that "addicts" (a term vastly over-used) are people who aren't handling their problems in the right way. They are not deviants or sickos or freaks, but wounded human beings - just like you. While most of us haven't sunk as low as these two, we still have our compulsions. Maybe you over-eat, are an exercise freak, or shop incessantly - one way or another we have to deal with our insecurities, traumas, and stress in some way or else we fall apart. Shame is an exploration of two people who use sex to ease their psychological pain, but what I liked about this movie was that it showed how universal our problems are. It's only in how we deal with it that we see differences, and hopefully Shame points out that disgust merely hides hypocrisy, and thus denial for those who can't see at least a little of themselves in these wounded and sympathetic characters.

Christ people. The degree of childish whining that accompanies many of these reviews is no better than the poor character they accuse Mick and Keith demonstating with regards to airbrushing Wyman out of photos or releasing product they feel is inferior. Is it a bit slap-dash? Sure. Are there some things available here that are also available on other easy to find RS label releases? Yes. If you're holding on to the dream of some masterful career retrospective, I'd put the one-hitter down for a second and deal with the cold, hard economic facts. Mick Jagger has never hid his penchant for squeezing as much money as he can out of his job, and who the hell can blame him? It is a job, isn't it? The Rolling Stones are just a band and not a way of life, right? And as far as Wyman goes, Keith is nothing if not fiercely loyal and Wyman just up and quit. Hard feelings? I'd bet. Petty? Depends on your point of view. Regardless, I buy their stuff when I want to, see them when I can afford to, and go on with my life. Some of these fans sound like bratty children who aren't getting what they want from mommy and daddy. Either that, or they want Jagger to feed their ocd anal-retentive need to own everything and re-burn chronologically accurate discs and God knows what else they do in their parent's basement with it. Look, children, there are plenty of places to buy bootlegs that have all the stuff you need. I just spent a few hours in Tokyo this past weekend and literally stumbled into a few places that sold Stones bootlegs and picked up really crisp, clean versions of CS Blues and Ladies and Gentlemen The Rolling Stones, along with a nice '72 tour disc. Then I just picked up this album after hearing some of it while I waited in line at Starbucks. I liked what I heard and dropped the 14 bucks or so. I consider it money well spent. Thank God I didn't heed the hatred in these reviews and gave it a fair listen instead.Fancy Man Blues is worth the admission price on its own and Tumbling Dice (frankly, I don't care how the hell it was pieced together), Beast of Burden (who BLOODY CARES WHAT SHOW??), and Let It Rock are all great live recordings, the B-sides are good to hear (honestly, what do you expect from a b-side for crissakes?) and the mix versions of some other songs are fun and catchy. How can someone claim that no true Stones fan cares about the re-mixes? How can someone be that freaking arrogant? Sorry chum, but I didn't realize there were membership requirements to being a fan of this band. Grow the hell up.If you want a nice little cd to listen to featuring some good to great Stones songs, buy it. If you want to be the number one self-delusional fact-checker regurgitator of all things Stones on Amazon.com as well as a perfectionist completist in need of a regular dose of clozaril, check with mommy and daddy's health plan and see if you're covered.

This isn't a bad book, as the one who labeled it "doggeral" states, but it isn't life altering, either. The characters are thinly drawn and the plot has some frustrating run-arounds that seem like contrivances. The ending is satisfactory and inspired and there are plenty of gaijin references that would most likely be missed by folks who have never spent significant time here. These are funny and bring up feelings of understanding from those of us who know Japan and, to be honest, made this book more interesting than it might be to others.This is an easy read and a pleasant fiction piece that, while it won't fill you with complex philosophical jewels, will engage you while you're riding on the JR.

Yes, I realize "not bad," is lukewarm praise at best, but it's fitting. This is a sweet little movie that probably could've been more but it's certainly better than lots of other movies that have received much more media attention and hype. I didn't even know this movie existed until it was made available through the Vine Program and that says more about the hype machine than it does about the quality of this movie.The cast is good, particularly Spacey (pretty much in every frame of the movie) and Heather Graham, as a woman dealing with her self-esteem issues. Spacey's daughter Claire is flatly portrayed by Camilla Belle and Craig Robinson and Virginia Madsen play cliches, but they are both talented enough to add just enough to elevate their characters above their weakly written roles.There is a sweetness in Spacey's huckster character Robert Axle, and the movie is less about satirizing the infomercial business (how can you satirize something that is funnier than any satire of it could ever be?) than it is about the fragility of relationships. Sure, most of what is said and done in Father of Invetion is unoriginal, but that doesn't mean it won't bring a smile to your face and keep your interest for the ninety minutes it takes.My recommendation is to wait until it gets into the budget bin and pick it up.

The Invention of Lying is a humorous softball of a movie that still manages to address the superficiality of humanity and the easy path many people take in life because they put their faith in a greater reward at the sacrifice of the here and now. It also deals with the base fears that are the basis of religion's power and influence in our life. And it's funny for goodness sake. It's Ricky Gervais funny.How perplexing that this movie has a majority of 1 star votes and Step Brothers has a majority of 5 star votes. I don't know if there is anything else to say. To compare them is pointless. I don't know what turns people off the most about this, but I think that at least part of it is the subtle-like-a-jackhammer take on religion and this makes people uncomfortable. That forced infantile humor devoid of even the slightest thought can be more enjoyable to the masses than this thoughtful, very funny and yet tender movie is a staggering reality. Truth is stranger than lies.

Great idea, Joshua Downham! His take on combining the best of this album and Goat's Head Soup was inspired. I'm going to add Black and Blue to the mix and create one fantastic album. Before boring you with my take on that concept, let me get to the album at hand.First of all, I picked up the cd to replace my ancient album when the flashy re-packaging of the red/white/blue sleeve caught my eye. Sadly, there is nothing else noteworthy about it - no extra tracks or anything like that, so that was a bit of a downer. It's purely a pipe dream to think that we'll ever get more out of the Stones than they wish, and with the key to the vaults clenched tightly between Mick's fingers, it'll take the death of a significant member and the break-up of the band before we ever get the real hidden treasures still out there.The songs aren't bad, but some songs have an unfinished quality to them and may very well have ended up as out-takes with a bit more time to consider their value. "If You Can't Rock Me" and "Time Waits For No One" (even though the solo goes on a bit too long for me) are the highlights. Some of the songs are earnest if nothing else and show some willingness to explore new areas; "Luxury" and "Fingerprint File," and I'm mixed on "If You Really Want To Be My Friend," which sounds like the Billy Preston audition tapes, (along with "Melody" from the album after this one) as well as "Till The Next Time We Say Goodbye." I don't care much for their cover of "Ain't Too Proud to Beg." The Stones can do a lot of things, but I don't find much of value in their Motown/pop-ish r'n'b covers, even going back to their first few albums. The remaining numbers are tired sounding, including the title track, "Dance Little Sister," and "Short and Curlies."Now, getting back to the super-album...I would take "Coming Down Again," "Winter," "Star Star," "Angie," "Heartbreaker," "If You Can't Rock Me," "Time Waits for No One," "Hey, Negrita," "Fool to Cry," "Memory Motel," and "Crazy Mama." These are my faves from the uneven trio of mid-late seventies recordings.

This is a good triple disc set of live Zeppelin to be sure. Maybe it is my comfort level with TSRTS that makes it hard for me to vote this higher, I don't know. There is much that is very similar, especially Dazed and Confused and parts of Whole Lotta Love although both of those are not as pleasing to me as TSRTS versions.The big pay-off for me is the acoustic set on the first disc. Actually, the whole first disc is fantastic, but the acoustic is such a bonus and so well done here.It has been recommended that you buy this AND TSRTS and that's a valid argument. Together they give you a pretty comprehensive overview of live Zeppelin from the early seventies, right around the time of Houses of the Holy. If you are not familiar with live Led, you should know that these are not note-for-note studio reproductions. Additionally, Jimmy Page has a tendency to get a bit sloppy live and some of the editing seems a bit more jagged than on TSRTS. Still, it is a very worthwhile collection of live performances and gives you a great companion piece to The Song Remains The Same. If you don't mind the somewhat steep price tag (although it is three discs), you'll enjoy the mighty Zeppelin live in all their sometimes ragged glory.

I had read review after review which hailed Tropic Thunder, but shortly before seeing it, a friend who has similar taste, said she literally fell asleep during it. Two extreme points of view that had me wondering which side of the opinion aisle I was going to stand on. Consider the two stars my answer. This movie was hugely disappointing. Critics seemed to love it because it skewers Hollywood, another of those insider movies that, for me, are far more smarmy and self-congratulatory than they are funny or memorable. Mel Brooks has always done this kind of thing well but Ben Stiller is not Mel Brooks and Tropic Thunder isn't even in the same ballpark as Blazing Saddles or even Silent Movie. The problem is that they spend so much time ripping on each other in some glorious back-stabbing fest that they forget about the rest of us who neither care about studio moguls, agents, or bloated celebrities nor find them people who are interesting, at least I don't. Whether Tom Cruise plays a great studio exec or Matthew McConaughey pulls off the loyal agent to Stiller's Tugg character are considerations that have no interest to me. None of the characters is that interesting and it is hard to care about the vanities of actors or the Hollywood pecking orders therein. There are no really funny jokes, the plot is ridiculous, the gags get tired very early on, and the best part of the movie is the opening pseudo-trailers. You know a movie misses the mark when the best it can do with Jack Black is reduce him to a smack-addicted Hollywood clich&eacute; going through withdrawals in the jungle. Hilarious! I'm sure Robert Downey, Jr. found much to laugh about in art imitating life, but I sure didn't. This movie is as predictable as it is dull: Stiller is an aging action hero who believes his own hype, Downey, Jr. is a method actor who spends so much time getting into other characters that he has none of his own, the gangsta rapper-turned-actor turns out to be a closeted homosexual, and the one untainted guy, the nerdy nave newbie played by Jay Baruchel is the lone touchstone the rest of us are supposed to identify with. And yet, he worships the very people who are so unappealing to me! Everyone is a phony, brown nosed, spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. Why would I care what happens to any of them? Whether this movie is accurate in how it sends-up movie making and all the boorish people involved is beside the point. I simply don't care at all about that E! garbage and watching a two-hour movie that had all the thrill of being the outsider at a work party was a huge waste of time. The only thing I do care about is my entertainment dollar and Tropic Thunder isn't worth the money I spent to watch it.

I liked Sideways for many reasons, but mostly because the characters were very believable and honest to me. I have read critics say they were upset about the undeserving happy ending. I'm not sure what movie they were watching but a happy ending is not the conclusion I drew at all. At best, it is a vague and open-ended conclusion. The only thing we might infer is that Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in what should have been an Oscar winning performance, finally begins to realize that he is a worthwhile person and that he has made peace with his divorce and begun the slow move forward. When he opens the forty year old bottle of wine he had been saving for the "right moment with the right person," and drinks it alone, I knew that his character had stopped the self-loathing that had eaten away at his happiness, his confidence, and his self-esteem. He was the right person and that was a powerful statement.As for his sexually compulsive acquaintance, the mere fact that he managed to get away with his debauched and troubling week of infidelity and cruel behavior does not mean that he got the happy ending. Without any sense of the kind of self-actualization Miles went through, this shallow and most likely self-hating person is doomed to continue his need for self-value via sexual conquests until his marriage is ruined or he has the chance to find out the root of his self-destructive behavior. The grin he flashes Miles as he is getting married is all I need to know that there was no epiphany in his tearful plea to Miles at the motel. His future looks far from happy to me.The women both seemed to be far ahead of their male counterparts. Maya, the perfect compliment to the needy and delicate Miles, has already re-directed her life after her deceit-filled marriage ended and it is her steadfastness and her new-found confidence and independence that allow her to re-connect with Miles and give him the benefit of a second chance. The scene between Miles and Maya in which they describe their love of wine is one of the most eloquent I have seen in a movie in a long while.This is a movie of characters. It is a movie about people who are wounded and far from perfect and yet who battle through the misery that life can be. These characters do things that make you angry and perhaps feel pity for them, but don't we all in the course of our lives? There are indeed no syrupy happy endings to Sideways. There is merely the knock at the door and the uncertainty of what will happen next. If you crave explosions, fast moving plots, blood, gore, puerile humor (all of which I can find quite entertaining!), Sideways is most assuredly not any of those things. It is a quiet movie that takes a wealth of empathy and understanding of the frailties of man to fully appreciate. Calling the characters whiny or saying it is boring means you simply didn't get it. Not everyone will. Not all movies are made for everyone on the planet to enjoy either. I enjoyed Sideways and am glad I bought it.

Some years back, a disturbing film called Fatal Attraction caused a big sensation by showing the absolute worst-case scenario of marital infidelity. Despite the near tragic climax of the movie, the viewer fails to see that the infidel learned his lesson and, to further obfuscate things, his adultery is overshadowed and practically pardoned by her mental instability. No deep introspection or navel gazing epiphany, just a close call and back to the way things were before. The Break-Up does a similar public service of sorts in demonstrating how bad things can go when people end their problematic relationship and similarly avoids addressing the root causes that created the mess. By the time The Break-Up ends, both partners have grown some, but not enough to make me believe they'll not make the same mistakes again. They have picked up the pieces and tidied up but you get the feeling that when it comes time to build again, it'll be the same old house of cards.After a whirlwind dating period turns to co-habitation, the shine fades and things quickly come to a head, thanks to the selfish antics of male stereotype Gary (Vaughn) and his predictable inability to do little more than meet his girlfriend half-way and Jennifer Aniston's Brooke, who makes the fatal error of trying to change someone who is firmly set in his ways, yet another clich&eacute;. But, that leads me to the bigger flaw of The Break-Up; using formulaic Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus images, the movie relishes demonstrating how ugly the end of a relationship can be and how fast love can turn to hate, but it never addresses the problem on a deeper level and gets to the heart of the matter. People aren't clich&eacute;s and relationships aren't supposed to devolve into little more than glorified roommates who sleep together nor should they feel compelled to "save" what is already terminal. Yet, the movie is chock full of couples sleepwalking through the sad dance of relationship boredom and misses the opportunity to flush out why they willfully allowed themselves to become the soulless zombies they are. All of us have known and/or been in situations where it is clear that things aren't right and yet few ever seem to have the courage, strength, or sense of determination and foresight necessary to pull the plug. Instead, we soldier on despite the profound differences, boredom, frustration, lack of sex, existential angst, and, in some cases, a genuine dislike of each other, purely for some misguided sense of commitment, financial responsibilities, kids, or, the most popular reason; fear of being unattached and alone. And people perpetuate these mistakes in one relationship after another like lab rats that just can't figure out that the cheese comes with an electric shock. The Break-Up, whether intentionally or not, exposes the inherent fraud of lifeless, dispassionate relationships. It reminds us in one uncomfortable moment after another, what happens when the faade is torn away. This movie is the antithesis of romantic and beneath the light humor and the two-dimensional roles, it serves up a cautionary warning for all of those desperate and fearful people who would rather spend nights next to Mr. or Ms. Wrong than rough it alone while keeping up the search. When you chose safety over risk, satisfaction over passion, or banality over excitement and romance you inevitably end with The Break-Up. Happy Valentine's Day.

Amazingly, Zack and Miri is a surprisingly tame and boring movie. The premise is interesting, but the assumptions are completely wrong. Maybe this movie would've worked in a different era, but now, with porn available for free in so many formats, the idea that people can get rich by making really awful porn is ridiculous and out-dated. Even the venue is wrong, since the money to be made by independent amateurs is on the internet and not in video. The story line even underscores that with the granny-panties thread, but Smith fails to see his own mistake. It's wrong to cast this issue aside, since it's the entire premise of the movie: how can people avoid immediate poverty? Make a low-budget porno! Not likely. I just can't imagine that many people would buy their awful skin flick given the unending amount of porn that is available for every possible taste. Sadly, a more realistic business venture is offered in the middle of the credits, but by then, what's the point?Kevin Smith is arguably one of the more over-rated film makers around. He had some decent successes with Mallrats and Chasing Amy and he broke plenty of new ground with his willingness to speak frankly about sex and relationships and honor the slacker in all of us, but he has clearly demonstrated his narrow capabilities since then because everything he has made afterward is largely a re-tread. Seth Rogen is his typical slacker self, Elizabeth Banks turns in the requisite impossible-that-she-would-in-any-universe-fall-for-Seth-Rogen role with about as much believability as one could muster, and the standard Smith vets do their standard Smith character turns. As for the rest, Traci Lords is cheap porn resume filler who can't act to save her life and the only real raunch comes from Jason Mewes and the other porn vet, Katie Morgan. The standard locker-room sex talk and bowel movement lines are beyond boring at this point in the 21st century, and so we are left with a thinly developed romance. That's the problem with the current crop of raunchy romances; the R-rated parts are pass&eacute; and the romance stories are contrived, obvious, lacking in drama, and scarcely plausible. This genre has become such an utter clich&eacute; as to make the very genre they are attempting to replicate (porn) seem unique.The laughs are few, the story is weak, and the acting (save Justin Long) is uninspired. Zack and Miri is about as much fun to watch as it is to sit through an entire porn movie.

I was turned onto this cd by a dear friend as I had a two hour car ride through scorching southwestern Nevada ahead and she felt it would be a great soundtrack for the ride. She was absolutely right.These eleven songs are quiet, evocative, and emotionally charged songs full of beauty and simple grace. There are some that were a bit out of character from the rest, but overall, this is a treat. Listening to the cd as the stark brown desert passed by my windows was a moving experience I will not soon forget.If you want further proof that this cd is powerful, I literally sobbed as I listened to "Wait." I can't think of even a handful of songs that have done that to me in my entire four and half decades of life.Safe to say that the next time she recommends a cd, I'm all over it.

For a chef, Anthony Bourdain is a pretty damn good writer. His style is smooth and conversational, peppered with lots of smart and subtle pop culture references. This narrative tale is neither cautionary nor told with regret, it is simply the story of a guy who worked hard, played hard, made lots of mistakes, and turned out pretty well in the end. It ends prior to his tv career got started, a fact he shrugs off in his typically blunt manner. In a television interview he was confronted by this and he said simply, "Yeah, irony sucks." In the update versions, he addresses and clarifies some of the errors and changes of heart he has had. He acknowledges his excessive bravado and it helps to take that into consideration. I read it to know more about the guy and I was able to balance the personality I see on tv with this younger version and flush out a more complete picture. We all change in life (hopefully, anyway) and it is fascinating to see change in ourselves and others as life batters us and leaves its scars.His character is what drives the story, despite the lurid thrill of the drugs, sex, and restaurant rock and roll that the character imbibes. Bourdain is a straight-forward, humble, opinionated, and somewhat misanthropic guy and his personality is appealing to me, probably because I see much of myself in that description. Moreover, he is clearly thankful for the revelatory experiences his vacation in France as a youngster provided, as well as the subsequent life epiphanies, soul-strengthening meals, and the hard lessons he has learned. He is keenly aware of just how unimportant he is and sees his mission now as an ambassador of pleasure and understanding. That kind of humility is refreshing in an era when celebrity is madly pursued by every idiot with a video cam and a willingness to make an idiot of themselves regardless of who else is scandalized by their single-minded self-destruction.Kitchen Confidential is a breezy, funny, and entertaining read. It brought back memories of my own days working in restaurants and does offer a brutally honest overview of what the culinary world might be for the curious ones seeking career change or a path in life. If, like me, you want to know a bit more about the guy you enjoy on No Reservations, this is a great read.

This is top five best of the 80s for me, and one of my favorite albums ever. I bought the album nearly two decades ago simply because I liked the cover art and was then dumbfounded when I heard the bewitching blend of harmonies, jangles, riffing, and achingly beautiful melodies that this this group lays down on this amazing record.I was so grateful to finally see it on cd and it has played non-stop since it arrived. This is the rare recording that you can literally hear over and over and over and over and never tire of and always sing along.If you like smart, melodious, guitar driven, two-part harmony rich music that sounds as timeless as true art does, buy this cd now and forever hum these remarkable songs in your head with joy and a happy heart. This is a fantastic album!

I was surprised to find out that Andy Lau and Gong Li were remaking the Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt movie from over a decade ago, but quite intrigued. I've always thought the original was amusing and sweet, par for the course for Nancy Meyers if not necessarily for Mel Gibson. Still, I wondered how close this remake would come and how these two stars would fair in a light-hearted romantic comedy. I'm surprised once again.Sticking very close to the original down to verbatim lines and all, Lau and Li seem comfortable with each other and this version seems to play heavier towards the romance and not so much the silliness of the original. It was nice to see these two actors, known for their art-house movies and action epics, have some fun, even down to the closing credit bloopers.My only issue is that there is a fairly heavy-handed appeal to western audiences with a soundtrack heavy on English language songs (Lau even sings a ballad to Li in English) which I thought smacked a little too much of pandering. I know movies are made to make money but this seemed a bit much. That said, the movie is cute and a nice Friday night movie with your lover over a bowl of popcorn.For subtitle-challenged viewers, the words tend to move very quickly at times, so have the remote handy and enjoy a lighthearted rom-com with two thoroughly enjoyable actors.

The best thing to say about this movie is that it mostly avoids the failings of so many of Hollywood's comedic efforts. In other words, it isn't a gross-out, genitalia-laden, bodily functions-heavy, everyone-act-like-a-thirteen-year-old pile of audience insulting stupidity. It does have a few unnecessary shots, but those are quick one-offs that, while totally unnecessary, don't torpedo things completely. The comedy is certainly crude, but at least they go for acerbic instead of infantile. Given how many puerile offerings are being made, I'm taking what I can get.There's a host of vaguely familiar actors, but the best effort comes from the dead panning Jason Segel, doing his best Bill Murray circa the mid-80s as the P.E. teacher. Justin Timberlake never fully convinces me as the substitute the two main female characters vie for, maybe because he seems to be trying so hard in every role I've seen him perform. Then there's Cameron Diaz as the main lead, playing against her normal cutesy characters as a slutty, ill-mannered, gold digging party girl who incredulously happens to be a public school teacher. The problem is that Cameron Diaz isn't Billy Bob Thornton so it was hard to buy her as the same kind of foul-mouthed loser he plays with such ease.Bad Teacher isn't a horrible movie, although it will probably offend those hand-wringing, paranoid, Helen Lovejoy-types who find any movie in which children are exposed to anything adult as the first steps on the road to the apocalypse. If you aren't one of those people, however, you might find some laughs along the way. From a teacher's perspective, there were some funny moments (the grading of papers, overzealous teachers, parent orientation), but the story has a lot of holes that simply don't make sense or stretch credulity too far, and thus prevent the movie from ever getting off the ground.Bad Teacher is tepidly recommended if you can preview it for free before buying. 2.5 stars.

Crazy Heart won't win awards for originality, but then again, country music is nothing if not completely derivative and clich&eacute;-ridden so why shouldn't a movie about a country singer be as well? It is not an unpleasant movie, but the problem is that the strong parts are equally countered by the weak ones and I walked away from this feeling fairly empty. I kept waiting for this movie to buck the many stereotypes it carries, but sadly it never does.All of that said, however, Bridges does his best as Bad Blake (a role he reprises for "True Grit," btw...) but it's often a two-dimensional role. That's the problem with Crazy Heart - it lacks the depth of character and the unpredictable nature of humanity to work as well as it might have. The gangs all here: the cute kid, the wise old friend, the sleazy agent, the hard luck woman, and the drunken country singer. All that's missing is the hooker with a heart of gold and the evil villain. Furthermore, it is burdened by too many gaps in credibility; chief among them - the attraction between Gyllenhaal's Jane and Bridge's Blake, and the seeming overnight cessation of not one but two addictions. If you want to throw in Colin Farrell as a country singer, that works for me, too. The romance irked me the most because there are scores of actresses who would've made this role so much more. Nothing to take away from Gyllenhaal, but she's far too young and not nearly rough-edged enough to work in this role. It is a classic example of Hollywood's inability to portray honest age-appropriate relationships. For the record, there are nearly three decades that separate the two.In short, Crazy Heart is a movie with good performances and whiskey-soaked songs but light on originality, reality, and plot. In the end, you might just be better off buying the soundtrack.

With GTA IV quickly becoming yesterday's news, it seems a bit odd to review it's predecessor, GTA San Andreas, but the notion came to me after playing the new version this weekend. While GTA IV is much better graphically and adds that much more realism to the game, the cost of doing so is too much for me. They gave up on so much of what made San Andreas fun and that's the reason I play video games - to have fun and be entertained.In the bizarro world of San Andreas, you get to play the epic character of Carl Johnson, a brash, irreverent, foul-mouthed, gangsta who drops some of the most hilarious lines I've heard. How can you not love a guy who screams, "I hate gravity!!" when falling off a building? Priceless. The beauty of this game is not in the missions. All of that stuff is fairly boring to me. I don't care if I complete missions or accomplish tasks or whatever; leave that to the gamers. I just want to lop someone's dome off with a kitana, shoot their head off with a sniper rifle and watch the fountain of blood spurt, or throw satchel bombs on them and then blow them up to watch the trajectory of their body. I want to laugh my tail off as I run over people on a motorcycle and they fly sky high, I want to hear the ridiculously offensive banter, I want to bazooka the world into oblivion, I want to use cheats and make myself invincible, I want to Super Punch someone fifty yards down the street, I want to fly a myriad of machines from a jet pack to a Hydra, I want to have meaningless sex with a host of freaks, I want to bet on the crudest and most perversely named horses, I want to win a million playing black jack and then shoot the dealer, I want to do side missions as a cop, ambulance driver, train engineer, or pimp, I want to kill drug dealers and take their money, I want to shoot the endless stream of Elvis impersonators strolling through Las Venturas. I want all of that and so much more. San Andreas delivers this is spades and unfortunately GTA IV does not. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is the video game equivalent of being a god in a world of excess. It allows me, the casual game player, to vent some frustration, laugh until it hurts, and lose myself for the occasional hour or two in a world where I am king and no one can stop me. My goodness...don't we all want that from time to time or is it just me?While my son and I did finish all the missions and complete the plot part of the game, we still have a few other side things to accomplish that we may or may not do because, really, who cares? We accessed all the cheats we could find and that made it fun and easy and thus that much more enjoyable. I don't play video games to be challenged. Life is challenging enough and I don't have endless hours to devote to playing the game. I'm a casual game player and not so much into role playing or heroic quests. I'm just in it for the laughs and they are a guarantee everytime I spend an hour or two with my boy CJ.

In an ideal world, this book would be read by everyone, but as this book brutally proves, we do not live in an ideal world. What is perhaps most shocking about this book, through the endless evidence of immorality, inhumane behavior, and ugliness man is thoroughly capable of, is the fact that America here and now is experiencing this same sickening frenzy and mania.At the risk of sounding utterly pessimistic, I know that there is no way people will read this in the numbers mankind needs, and that for many that do read it, the blinders of self-righteousness allow them to excuse their own beliefs from those they read about.The current administration knows the public frighteningly well.

Perhaps the most perplexing thing about Larry Crowne is that it was made in the first place. My guess is this was the bone the studio threw to Hanks in exchange for signing some other deal. The point being, this is a tired format (middle age rediscovery) and it's been done before much better. Off the top of my head, I can think of Sideways and there are doubtless many more.The problems have to do with the lack of reality - as others have pointed out. There are financial holes in logic, e.g., the house Crowne lives in afforded on a bottom-rung retail gig unless we are to assume he did his time in the U.S. Navy and has a nice retirement. That's feasible, but it then doesn't describe why he feels the need for career insurance. Why not just find another retail job or keep the diner job since he's already got a solid retirement income? Also - why didn't he go to college while in the service?Continuing with the unanswered but necessary questions, why the acceptance of this middle aged guy into a hip scooter gang? What is it about Larry that makes him so appealing to everyone? Why didn't his marriage work? Where are the kids he envisioned having? What's his back story? There are simply too many questions without answer and plot contrivances to make me suspend disbelief and thus buy into the movie, not the least being Julie Roberts' weak and clich&eacute;d bad marriage that conveniently ends just in time for Hanks to show up and rescue her.This is the kind of movie that wants to make you happy but skimps on a script and goes straight for star appeal and conventionality. I understand every movie doesn't have to be gritty and realistic, but this is pure fluff without any heart at all. Having Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts go through the motions as, well, Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts characters, isn't enough to carry a movie. I'm usually a sucker for a decent rom-com or character study, but lacking in fully developed characters, Larry Crowne is neither. Maybe these types of movies should come with a label that says "This is what we allowed Tom Hanks to do in order to close a bigger deal. Sorry, The Studio."

Get Him to the Greek is yet another in the line of Apatow spawn. I suppose that introductory sentence could serve as the entire review since the movies from this one time mildly talented stand up comedian are all sadly similar. Take one super-sized geek, one cute woman incredulously attracted to him, a smattering of quirky side characters, one hard-to-believe storyline with a smattering of maudlin sentiment, stir in excessive amounts of drugs/booze/bodily fluids, and let the hijinx ensue. Serves: anyone willing to forfeit time and money for low expectations.Jonah Hill is Seth Rogen, Jr., Russell Brand plays himself, Elisabeth Moss plays the too-attractive to seriously be with the lead schlub in their quirky relationship female role, and Sean Combs goes for over-the-top (seriously, how sad is it that he is the best part of this movie?). The recurring gag? Jonah Hill vomits. The best part is the songs, hilarious in the Spinal Tap vein. All stars for this movie are based solely on these sophomoric yet amusing numbers. What can I say? I'm a sucker for raunchy song comedy. That the actors actually sing them is an extra bump.This movie isn't awful, it's just so predictable, so contrived, so mildly amusing, so lowest common denominator, so superficial, so...Judd Apatow.

John Mayer couldn't have come to me with less of a negative vibe than he did when I was gifted this cd by a friend who is a huge fan. I have always liked her choices in music but she didn't help Mayer's cause by professing that she has often envisioned humping his leg during the many times she's seen him in concert. Her lust only underscored a common criticism of this artist; that he is more college girl heartthrob than cool guitar hero. It doesn't help that I'm beyond sick of seeing this guy's mug every time I stand on line in a supermarket and come face to face with the bathroom journals that scream at you from their perch next to the jerky and candy bars. On top of all of this, a particular interview I read revealed him to be arrogant and buying into his own hype. Therefore, I would have to say that I was not thinking much of what John Mayer's music would be like.Well...I like it! John Mayer is not the second coming of anyone, he isn't the greatest guitarist I've ever heard, and he's exceedingly derivative in tone and vocals. It's easy to imagine the casual radio listener mistaking one of his songs for a handful of others who he sounds almost copyright-infringement like. But...it's good stuff nonetheless.I like this one better than other cds I've subsequently listened to as there is a maturity and a bit less of the pop-idol-to-heartbroken-women vibe going on. "Belief," "Vultures," "Stop This Train," and "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room" are all really nice songs full of sweet beats, his vibrato-laden Strat licks, and intelligent if, at times, a bit overly-earnest lyrics (but, hey, if it works for Don Henley...).This is a cd that is easy to listen to, guitar-rich, and sometimes poignant and you rarely get all of those traits even from some of the many masters that Mayer seems to mimic. Ignore the E! gossip, his legion of lusty fans, the wannabe comparisons to Hendrix, Vaughn, et al, and even his unfortunate lack of humility and just give the music a chance. John Mayer's music is good stuff...but I still don't have the slightest interest in humping his leg.

This is an amazing movie. If you took parts of Itchy & Scratchy, GTA San Andreas, Blaxploitation movies of the 70s, and bad porn, and then had it stirred up, dipped in batter, and deep fried by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's unholy spawn, you get this stupidly perfect movie.Some of the scenes in this insane grindhouse fest will have you pause, rewind, re-watch, and repeat: they are that freaking over-the-top. There were at least a half dozen literal jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, WOW moments. I wish I could share some of the great moments but they have to be witnessed in stunned amazement as I did, without any preparation.Now let's get this straight; this movie has almost no genuine redeeming cinematic qualities. The plot is ridiculous, the script inane, there is no semblance of reality, and there is a moronically heavy handed pro-illegal immigrant message. However, there is a reason this movie boasts big names and I'm pretty sure it wasn't for the paycheck or the chance to get an Oscar. It's because this is pure artery-clogging joy. If you feel the need to critique this movie you probably also look for the sanitary qualities of a truck taco. I don't know about you, but some of the best food I've ever eaten came from a truck. I can't sum it up any better than that.

Amazon really needs to consider some alternatives to the five star ratings. It is simply too easy to lump a variety of albums into one category even though they may differ slightly. It's the difference between a B+ and a B- if you will - sorry, it's the teacher in me. I would make this a 6 if it were a 10 point scale, opposed to Dirty Work or Emotional Rescue or Black and Blue being 7s. It's good but not a Stones cd that I play all the time. I play other eighties Stones albums more than this if that gives you any perspective.What I used to really like about this recording was that, in the vinyl days, one side was rock, the other slower songs. It was kind of cool that you could choose your mood and play the side to fit. Granted, you can do the same now as the pacing is not changed, but I just wanted to point out that geezer factoid. I tend to like the slower side best. There are some really great songs there and Mick is in fine form.The rocking side has the more familiar numbers including Start Me Up which can make the unique claim of having its opening riff being universally accepted as a sports icon. In sports arenas around the globe, Keef's opening hammer-on chording signals the faithful to get up and cheer the home team. Not many musicians can make that claim - not that they'd want to, either. It is a fast-paced and typical Stones rocking cadre of songs and it won't disappoint even the casual Stones fan. Ronnie's contribution of Black Limousine is the highlight for me. I love the Stones doing the blues.Many call this the last great album or some such label and I disagree. All Stones albums since the 70s have to be taken at face value - they have some good and some average and even some bad. Yet, it's the Stones and that always makes me happy.

There are some very good songs on this follow-up to the heavily lauded Some Girls album, the kick off for the Stones reincarnation following the dark times and inconsistent recordings of the mid-70s.Back when I had the album, I wore out the second side that starts with the rocking Where The Boys Go and is followed by the excellent Down In The Hole. This is a fantastic blues work-out, surpassing the recent Back Of My Hand from A Bigger Bang which sounds far more contrived. The title track is a throw-away number, but She's So Cold is irresistable and Keith's comical croaking kiss-off to Anita, All About You, is sincere if crushingly acidic. As for the other songs, Dance (Pt. 1) is a really unique and funky little groove that shows how valuable Ronnie can be, solid rockers like Let Me Go and Summer Romance won't disappoint, Send It To Me covers Keith's reggae jones, and the touching country ballad Indian Girl closes out the other half.I have logged plenty of hours of my life enjoying this record and I think you will, too.

I have to disagree with the folks who claim this is some underappreciated gem. I do agree, however, with the reviewer who claimed that this is the album that non-Stones fans might like. Does that sound like what you'd like to know about a Stones album; that it doesn't sound like one Stones fans would like? Regardless, he hits the nail on the head. This album is not very good. I love the Stones, and like a parent with their children, I have a hard time finding fault, but my God, this is really not good at all. One reviewer tries to rationalize support of this album with historical data, but if they can put out the much better Dirty Work in the midst of literally being at each other's throats, what excuse can they have for this poor effort?The title track is good, the follow up, She Was Hot, works well enough despite the title sounding far too much like a flip-side to She's So Cold. Tie You Up has some nifty stinging licks and some raunchy lyrics, but then the album goes quickly down hill. Keith's requisite number, Wanna Hold You, as well as Too Much Blood, with the really out of place and forced macabre rap, and Pretty Beat Up (does this song go anywhere?) sound like outtakes from their respective solo efforts, so you wonder how in the world they ended up as actual inclusions on a genuine Stones album. Feel On is the reggae inclusion and not a very good one, and the last three songs, Too Tough, All The Way Down, and It Must Be Hell, finally get back to Stones riff and roll, but it is too little too late.I remember when this first came out, it had some stickers inside the album sleeve that you could affix to the album. When you start pulling out tricks that Kiss usually stoops to, you know something is wrong. Of the many albums this group has available, either start with England's Newest Hitmakers and move forward or move backward from A Bigger Bang. By the time you hit this black hole of Stones music, you'll know why this one simply falls way short of their best.

Easy A was amusing and took an interesting premise and ran with it pretty far. Emma Stone does her job efficiently and with appropriate levels of teen sarcasm and uncertainty. On the other hand, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson do as well as they can, but their characters are ridiculous cartoons. This is always a problem with teen movies, going back to Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause. They are the 21st century version of the girl's parents from Valley Girl - painfully hip and free and understanding. The mom and daughter talk towards the end was almost unbearable. Can't parents be written more believeably instead of like ridiculous cliches?Nearly all of the problems I had are related to my a) watching a light-hearted movie too closely and b) being 47 and not 17. For the record, my youngest two kids (14 & 15 as I type) thought it was great. First - the concept seemed odd to me. I kept wondering why a girl having sex in high school was seen as so horrifying. Am I to believe that in 2010 (when the movie was released) high school students having sex is seen as taboo and the fast track to character ruination? I graduated in 1981 and I can tell you for certain - that wasn't the case then. Have we actually gone backwards in our social view of teen sex? Someone please contact you local conservative tea bagger and let them know the good news. To that point then; if that's the case, then why do so many of her peers want to be viewed as non-virgins as well? Is it the gender double-standard or is it a problem with plot consistency?Spoiler alert: Secondly, when has a teacher having sex with students been treated with such a casual attitude? Not only does Emma Stone's character volunteer to assist the teacher in getting out of her mess, but she seems totally unfazed by it.Lastly, the heavy handed nature of the movie is problematic. Not only the Scarlet Letter part, but the Christian bashing. Trust me - I am no fan of religion whatsoever, but this was simply over-the-top. It's this kind of blatant attack on religion that get the right all pissy about Hollywood. If you're going to bash religion - great - contact Bill Maher and work on a plan. But in a teen movie that has a fairly light tone, the sarcastic mockery towards Christians was like shooting fish in a barrel. It might've felt good at the time but it comes across as a cheap shot.Like I said, I watched this far too closely and critically, but my review is more for the people who are from my generation. This movie has a target audience and I wasn't a member. I laughed a little, smiled a fair amount, and rolled my eyes as well. There's my review in a single sentence.

I enjoyed Babel, but not on the level of "best picture of the year." I found last year's Crash to be a much better drama of this sort (multiple stories intermingling). The acting is stellar, the story is well told, and the scenery and imagery were breathtaking. These worlds I have known -Mexico and Japan, and I enjoyed watching those scenes. I thought this movie was probably a good thirty to forty-five minutes too long, especially since much of the ending seemed a bit too easily wrapped up. All-in-all, though, you could watch dozens of bigger wastes of time than Babel and it is a solid, thought provoking, and somewhat provocative movie.On a side note...what saddens me the most as I read the reviews is how so many people got uptight with some of the images in the movie. Their own discomfort with such things says more about them than the movie's content. Better to live in your dream world than to face reality, I guess. Now there's the real tragedy and truly the missed point of the movie. Movies like this force the viewer to confront things they'd rather not think about as they go about the deadening banality of their socially accepted and sanitized lives. I'm sure a good soaking in the bathtub of their home in the cul-de-sac followed by a excessive bloat at Applebee's and a materialistic orgasm at Wal-Mart made everything all better.

Sunday afternoon coming down after a nice, long, relaxing week away from work and I decide to veg in front of "Something Borrowed," a formulaic romcom I stumbled upon. Two best friends who also both harbor secret, as-yet unrequited love for each other dragged me around for longer than was necessary and all I wanted was someone to get some cojones. Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield play the lovers with plenty of unconvincing looks of wanting and feet of clay. The third wheel is Kate Hudson, who once again plays a cliched materialistic party girl (hey, her mom made a career of playing stock characters, so why not?) and John Krasinkski is fairly wasted as the long-suffering best friend. Now, let the games begin.As I referenced earlier, it's nearly two hours and far too long to dangle the will-she/he or won't she/he carrot on the stick in front of the audience. Furthermore, it leaves some loose ends that should've either never been introduced or better resolved. Lastly, it gives us few if any characters to truly care about. No one is honest with themselves or the objects of their desire, and the longer it goes on the less we care about anyone.I'm sure plenty will enjoy it but I found it a hole that sucked the remains of my weekend. Hopefully, there's still some time to save it. Let's see what else is on...

Hamlet 2 is a very inconsistent movie. It is simultaneously laugh-out loud funny as well as maddening in the dozens of dead ends and wasted characters that are introduced. It is either a case of bad editing or poor writing, but this movie could have eliminated at least two characters completely without affecting the plot and could have eliminated a hand full of scenes for similar reasons as well. Steve Coogan is a funny enough actor but he can not carry this movie on his own. There are times when he tries too hard and has your finger itching for the remote and, yet, there are other times when he does a nice take on the lines he is given. I am curious as to why he had to lose the accent because I think it would've made his role a bit more convincing and comical - the failed English actor in Tucson - but the writer/director had other ideas. The whole Elisabeth Shue part is genius and the actors and writing for the high school students is believable and well-done. On the other hand, Arquette and Kenner are unnecessary and the small amount of influence their characters bring to the plot might've just as easily been inferred or done off-screen and we would've then been spared Kenner's painfully contrived role and Arquette's largely mute inclusion. Additionally, there are many issues that are touched upon but in such an ephemeral manner that it is little more than a squandered opportunity; e.g. child abuse, coming to grips with one's sexuality, psychological counseling, alcoholism, cultural stereotyping, pointless relationships, and dreams crushed in the face of harsh realities.It is not until the performance of the production at the center of the movie that this uneven offering hits its stride. The musical numbers are hilarious and the reactions of the angry mob and the thug enforcers are priceless. Also, the short-lived but utterly brilliant work of Amy Poehler as the ACLU lawyer further helps to salvage this movie and make me put it on my shelf rather than take it back to the video store for a trade-in.I was interested in the movie because it eschews political correctness and skewers close-minded religious types. It further hits home for me because it is set in Arizona in a public school and the crack of Tucson being the place where dreams go to die is a funny albeit harsh jab at the southwestern world where I have spent much of my teaching career. Those reasons brought the movie into my home and the exquisite satire of the play within the movie is what will keep it here.

The Adjustment Bureau is one of my favorite movies of the last few years. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play perfectly off of each other while the sci-fi plot tosses enough compassion and endearment in to keep cynicism in check. It's the kind of movie I relish, in no small part because I'm a gigantic sucker for the magical power of true love.Furthermore, I love this movie because it is the kind of movie that reminds me of the great movies from the 30s and 40s - optimistic movies that take the world we live in and people we can relate to and put them in situations that reveal their strong sense of truth and the goodness in humanity as well as their unfailing belief in love.I admit that it's way too easy to knock The Adjustment Bureau for being heavy-handed and hokey, and it is without a doubt. But thanks to genuine and endearing performances by Blunt, Damon, and Anthony Mackie as the bureau member with a conscience, the movie manages to sink its hook deep inside my heart and take me along for a thrilling and glorious ride.

Mr. Popper's Penguins is another in Jim Carrey's career plan to turn into the next Eddie Murphy; a talented comic actor who can't stop making cornball family movies that are short on creativity, good writing, and plausibility and long on clowning and shtick. In this latest offering, Carrey even explains his gags now, entirely re-issued from his earlier films, as if to be ironic as well as funny. I enjoy Jim Carrey's talent but I can't understand why he isn't smart enough to hold out for something better (same question directed at Eddie Murphy).MPP suffers from the same things that seem to define family movies nowadays; brash children (although, to be fair, toned down significantly from other performances - note the less bratty performance from Madeline Carroll who played a much more horrid teenager in The Spy Next Door), cute animals who they insist have to perform some bodily function to get laughs, and a weak and predictable moral lesson about what really matters in life. What's worse is that they use classic children's stories as the vehicles for such dreck. They can't even come up with their own stories. They have to destroy cherished classic books. Wouldn't it have been better to gather the family for a reading of the book instead of mindlessly vegging in front of this awful movie? What's even better is that they could've watched the movie and then spent a stimulating post-movie bonding time dissecting just how badly the movie failed and teaching the greater lesson that entertainment doesn't have to be poop jokes and facial contortions.Tons of families will enjoy it, buy it to add to their burgeoning collection of visual stimuli to make up Family Night, and everyone makes a pretty penny. Am I the only one who sees the waste of talent, the lack of effort, and the insult to the audience? Beyond that, isn't there some parental responsibility to not inundate your children with feeble entertainment? Isn't there enough garbage on tv to negate the need to actually purchase such a terrible movie? Aren't there hundreds of better things for you and your children to do than sit in front of the t.v. to watch this insipid film? Sorry for the buzzkill and for generating the inevitable "It's just a movie - lighten up!" replies. You're right. It is just a movie. So is "Idiocracy."

I've recently been on a Bourdain binge; devouring hour after hour of his show on dvd, reading his works, both fiction and non-fiction, and coming to realize that, like so many craftsmen, it gets a bit repetitive after a while. That's not a bad thing, but it's a truism just the same. My favorite band of all time is The Rolling Stones, after all, and if anything is somewhat predictable, it is my beloved Stones. And so it is with The Nasty Bits, a heaping plate of older writings from magazines, etc. that were put together into one collection and then microwaved with a paragraph or so of follow-up commentary in the back. The comments are a nice touch because it shows how Bourdain's opinions can morph and change with additional life experiences, one of his most endearing qualities. Anthony Bourdain's integrity seems to be built upon an open and curious mind instead of a dogmatic stubbornness.There are many, many areas in this book where I come across the same bits that have appeared in other places; e.g. the tales of his drug days, his preference for simple foods (dirty water hot dogs, et al), his love of the Ramones and crime stories, the endless Col. Kurtz references, and/or his self-effacing sense of humor, to name a few, that now border on shtick. This means that I am spending too much time with the guy and doesn't detract from his writing, especially for the less-immersed reader. The stuff is still funny and sagacious.Additionally, I am not a foodie and there are times when the constant French food name dropping becomes tiresome. I simply don't care about Coq that or Beure this, whatever the hell those things mean. I find writing about food just as boring as writing about sex. These are things that need to be experienced, not read about. If anyone knows this to their very core, it is Mr. Bourdain. A self-professed pleasure provider, he knows that words can not do justice to sensory delights no matter how many adjectives are used. I realize that he is a chef and a food guy, but these are not the reasons I enjoy his output. What I do find appealing are his easy style, his brutal honesty, his sharp eye, his fearlessness, his iconoclasm, and his philosophical musings born of an intuitive moment during his many travels. He does noble work in trying to bring the outside world into the safe and xenophobic homes of Americans, and that may be his greatest accomplishment. That he used his success from a book that opened up the kitchen to a largely nave public as a springboard for international travel and cultural understanding is a benefit for the lot of us.The Nasty Bits is an easy read and is full of some of the best of his strongly opinionated work. Whether it is championing the invaluable contribution of Hispanics in the restaurant business or taking on America's woeful dietary habits and self-entitled gluttony, Anthony Bourdain strikes a Ramonesian power chord for intellectual curiosity and cultural observation.

I wasn't gonna, but then I did...I broke down and bought the re-issue. I'll probably go back and buy the re-issue of the debut album, too, because I enjoy the hell out of this one!The music itself is still as fresh and rocking and pleasing as it was when I first bought the vinyl version way back when it was released. Seeing them on that tour in Pittsburgh was one of my favorite concert experiences as well. Now, with the extra concert bonus stuff on disc two, it is that much more difficult to stop listening to it over and over and over! I get just as frustrated as the next working stiff when I face the prospect of buying a disc I already own just to pick up more stuff, but this is a legitimate case for dropping the dime. If you need to, sell the original to a store that buys back used discs and get some in-store credit towards something else or better yet, a few bucks for some refreshments! If you like this album, you'll love the re-issue. Viva the Pretenders!

I love this game, my kids (ages 10,11,16) love this game, and we play it often. Even though it is several years older than others that have come out since, it is a fallback of joy, laughter, thrills, and excitement. The you vs. game component isn't bad and you have three levels to work with to get yourself to the end. But it's the journey, my friends. Plastic army men on household and back yard battlefields was like having the games you used to play as a kid with these toys come to life!The Capture the Flag and Death Match parts are the best, especially Death Match, which is four player and usually what the kids and I play. You will have to adjust your brightness in the options section as it is pretty dark, but the adjustment makes it fine. Hurl grenades, find the flamethrowers or HMG for maximum firepower, and find the protective gear and you're set for a great time. It is easy to master thanks to the automatic targeting aim, so even the lamest novice can do well. Making it that much cooler from a parent's point of view, this isn't bloody at all - they're plastic!! It's kind of funny to watch these giant holes get blasted in the plastic guys and yet they still run around! Imagine the character from T2 as a plastic army man!I could ramble on and on but let me just say that I believe you will really enjoy this. Unless your child (or you) need some blood drenched game to enjoy, this game is a blast!

A movie like The Tourist is hard to be objective about when it comes with such star power, the critics widely trash it, and it goes from big screen to dvd within weeks. Even Ricky Gervais dog-piled not once, but twice to Johnny Depp's face during back to back Golden Globes ceremonies. I fully expected a total train wreck when I got around to watching it.It's not a train wreck but it's not very good. In going for the narrow lightweight espionage/romance/travelogue genre, The Tourist comes across as nothing more than a pale imitation. Jolie can pull of old time movie star appeal but her cheesy British accent offsets any credibility her glamour points get. Furthermore, she doesn't so much act as model clothes and jewelry. Depp doesn't even try for suave and goes straight for schleppy teacher clich&eacute;. I kept wishing he would visit a barber and transform, but he doesn't. In the milieu this movie strives to reproduce, even regular folk like Depp's character would be credited with a modicum of style and sophistication. In a movie that goes for style with substance, it was a poor omission. Furthermore, the heat between the two stars was tepid at best, as were the performances that wavered between mildly amused and comatose.The Tourist is a gorgeous movie that surprised me more than I thought it would with touches of droll humor and a nostalgic tip of the hat to movies we are hard-pressed to find anymore. In the end, however, it seemed only able to recreate the lovely wrapping paper while leaving the box inside empty.

I should have known that any movie with George Clooney portraying a politician would generate immediate and rabid negativity from some conservatives who see him as a big part of the Hollywood liberal elite.Their non-reviews aside, Ides of March is a pretty good movie. It is paced well, the acting is good (especially Ryan Gosling) and the plot, while predictable, draws you in. It's about political treachery, ambition, and the ugliness therein, but more than that it speaks to the fallibility of all of us, to our naivet&eacute;, and to the battle within our hearts and minds between cynicism and hope. It reminds me a bit of All The King's Men in that respect.This is a movie that is well done but moreover has a larger point to be made. Despite what those who hate George Clooney, er, I mean the movie will write in their reviews, Ides of March is not a liberal propaganda film masquerading as a suspenseful political drama. It is a taut and thought-provoking movie for our times.

I enjoyed this movie a lot! Meryl Streep is perfect as Julia Child in a performance that never seemed anything less than reverent, and she alone is worth the price of admission. Amy Adams is good as the blogging Child devotee who takes on the task of recreating every recipe in Child's seminal cookbook, and together these two actresses deliver a very nice treat of a movie.The movie criss-crosses back and forth between Child's years in France and Julie Powell's years in Queens and the similarities are fascinating. Dual story lines only work if they are woven together to make a greater product, and so it is with Julie and Julia.Underscoring the storyline regarding Julie's daunting undertaking are the twin relationships of the ladies. Streep and Tucci (both are always so good) bring such a warmth and believability to their supremely supportive marriage. On the other hand, Adams and Chris Messina as her husband Eric, do a good job of showing a different albeit equally loving marriage, strained at times by the mania of Julie's increasingly self-absorbed lifestyle.As in so many movies, however, Streep is the reason to check this out. But beyond her Oscar-worthy role, there are funny, sweet, endearing, and beautiful moments in this hard to resist movie.

This is an awful movie. It's essentially more of the same atrocity that fueled "Are We There Yet?" Cartoon characters, horribly brattish children, awful acting, weak writing, and an overall feel that this was something Nickelodeon or ABC Family wouldn't even consider. Honestly....Jackie Chan in geek glasses playing straight man to freaking Billy Ray Cyrus? Oh, Jackie...As far as entertainment for a family, do you really want your children watching these horrible, rude, disrespectful, sarcastic, and downright perverted children? Why would anyone find these brats amusing? You know what would've been truly funny? If they found some Jackie Chan, Jr. to kick their horrid little a$$es. I'd buy the movie if that was the case. The faint glimmer of hope that if I watched it until the end, I'd actually see some long overdue comeuppance for these children was the only reason I hung around. Seriously, there have got to be at least five things laying within immediate reach of you right now that are less wasteful of your time than this movie. This movie is so terrible that you'd be better off staring at a blank tv screen for ninety minutes than burning up time watching The Spy Next Door. You've been forewarned.

Given the large numbers of people who referred to this silly little movie as one of the worst ever, I wonder where we draw the line between critical assessment and pure gut reaction in forming our opinions of entertainment. What separates Step Brothers, which I hated, from Mall Cop, which I enjoyed? Why did this movie work whereas Funny People, another more critically received Sandler project, disappointed me?There is little original in the story, there are the predictable credibility issues (young attractive girl falls for shleppy overweight loser - oh, what hath Seth Rogen wrought?), and there's Sandler's penchant for schlocky 80s pop music touchstones that buddy Kevin James is borrowing, but still I found myself laughing out loud during much of this movie even when I saw the gag coming from a mile away. Either my opinion isn't worth squat or the reviewers who tore this movie to shreds need to lighten up. Or maybe neither. Maybe individual taste is just too complex to figure out and the reasons we react the way we do to entertainments aren't so important after all. All I know is that I liked Mall Cop. I laughed a fair amount. I would watch it again. Does that qualify as an endorsement?

This is one of the best records the Stones have ever released. It is concise, powerful, intense, and brilliantly played. It is amazing how well Mick Taylor melds into the band, so recently added as he was by the time this tour started. I'm not convinced that the strict lead/rhythm method the band took on during his tenure is the best sound for the band. I think Brian Jones and/or Ron Wood weaving their guitars with Keith is better than Taylor's more constricting format, but this is still an excellent highlight for that unique stage in the Stones' history. I can't imagine Love In Vain ever done better than here with Taylor demonstrating his slide chops and his additions to Jumping Jack Flash, Midnight Rambler, Sympathy, and Street Fighting Man are excellent as well.Furthermore, the band is truly scary on Midnight Rambler, Street Fighting Man is exhilirating and leaves you breathless, Sympathy is quite different than the studio version with good lead work by both guitarists, and Live With Me and the Chuck Berry covers are as rocking as any band ever gets (as well as being Keith Guitar School 101). There is simply not a dull moment or a bad song on this entire set.As Keith pummels you with the opening hammer of Jumping Jack Flash just after Sam Cutler introduces the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World, you may come to realize that this document is the evidence that proves his Beatle-bashing boast beyond any doubt.

The first time I sat and watched No Reservations with Tony Bourdain, it was because I'd stumbled upon the Paris episode while channel surfing one bored summer afternoon. Paris has long been a dream destination of mine, so I checked it out. From the get-go, my expectations were challenged and my interest piqued. The Eiffel Tower? Notre Dame? The Louvre? Not on this show. How about an absinthe bar followed by a hallucinogenic night back in the same hotel room where Oscar Wilde died instead? Or a visit to a wine cellar that leads to an eerie stumble through catacombs and sewers? Or the central market where we see a decapitated reindeer and hear our narrator apologize to children awaiting Christmas presents because "Santa cut Rudolph's f-ing head off?" I quickly realized that this wasn't some tired, formulaic, and superficial travelogue or some half-baked Fear Factor retread with the host trying to make the viewer squirm. This was intellectual and thoughtful, spiced with Bourdain's jaded attitude, searing sarcasm and caustic sense of humor. Furthermore, I liked that he sought out the understated, sublime, local favorites instead of the popular tourist stops and that he preferred the seedy and debauched over the posh and staid. This was a guy who was visiting Paris like I would like to do. This was an anti-tourist show hosted by an anti-hero. I was immediately a fan.This dvd collection features eight episodes and, as many have already noted, it is an incomplete collection. According to Amazon's offerings, there are 13 episodes in the first season available for individual purchase, so why there are only eight here is hard to fathom. It seems likely that a more comprehensive and accurate compilation will eventually come around, so keep this in mind when contemplating purchasing this set. Also, these are edited with profanities (and there are many) bleeped out and there are no frills at all. It is episodes only, no commentary, behind the scenes, interviews, or anything. Again this leads me to think that a better release might be in order with Bourdain's predictably derisive commentary, the missing scenes available on the channel's website, and perhaps some other goodies. He has already amended his books, so it seems possible that the dvds will get a new look as well. The show and the fans deserve it. My four star rating is based on the content, however, and not the problems outside of the material contained herein. Whether you wish to spend twenty bucks on an incomplete collection that is badly in need of an upgrade is up to you. It is the nature of entertainment corporations to re-release popular items to force serious fans to re-purchase something that should have been done right the first time. Greed...don't ya love it?The best episodes? A visit to his roots in New Jersey that demonstrates things aren't nearly so bad here in the states if you apply the same open-mind and tolerance to your countrymen that you do to your foreign country hosts, the aforementioned "French Don't Suck" visit to Paris, the humbling and life-threatening journey to New Zealand, his James Bond inspired trip to North Vietnam, and the harrowing yet introspective excursion to Malaysia.The lesser ones are the Sicily, Iceland, and Las Vegas installments. Sicily was hokey and out of character. It felt forced, insincere, and uninspired. Iceland is like the Sweden episode from a future season; there is little of interest outside of Viking references, cold temperatures, and questionable food. He doesn't carry himself with passion in these spots as he does in those locales where his soul seems enriched by the experience. For Las Vegas, he tries hard to bring in a Fear and Loathing vibe, but let's face it; every other show on The Travel Network or The Food Channel seems to take place in that city and I'm just sick of Las Vegas already. Las Vegas is nothing if not THE most overrated city in the country, if not the world, and one more person's take on Adult Disneyland is one less I need to see. If only what happened in Vegas truly stayed there, I wouldn't be subjected to it every time I turned on the boob tube. That personal gripe aside, even the three sub-par ones are still worth viewing just to see these places and watch Bourdain struggle at times to find humor in the occasional ridiculousness of travel television.Season one is a good beginning to what has become regular tv viewing for me. This is smart, engrossing, and fun television. Now if they can just get the true and complete collection together...

As one brilliant reviewer put it, this movie stays with you long afterward and that, to me, is the hallmark of an extraordinary experience. I will be dreaming about and thinking about this fantastic movie for days and would happily pay box office prices to see it again.Natalie Portman - an actress I'm not that enamored with - gives the performance of a lifetime as the ballerina who is steadily and rapidly breaking down psychologically. The movie joyfully toys with what is real and what is her illusion and, even though the black swan/white swan concept is somewhat in your face, the twists and surprises kept me guessing as to what was real and what was not. The supporting cast does stellar work, particularly Barbara Hershey as Portman's controlling mother and fading prima ballerina Winona Ryder. But it's the vision and Portman's riveting performance that were so compelling and captivating.I recommend the theater if possible as the experience is so much greater when you find yourself lost in this oft-surreal world. For what it's worth, I saw True Grit and enjoyed it. Black Swan was immensely better. This is one I will surely buy when it comes out on dvd. Highly recommended.

I read many reviews from both Amazon and other print sources and the overwhelming reaction to Fred Claus was one of disappointment and worse. This won't be the first nor last time I am glad I looked into something for myself instead of trusting others. I don't know if it is my own sordid, pathetic personal life history or what, but this movie touched me and I left the movie emotionally moved and struck by how something advertised as your typical holiday comedy fare (read: stupid and infantile) could have delivered such a blow to my heart.Vince Vaughn, who is the Bill Murray of his generation, delivers an endearing performance, Paul Giamatti is, as always, brilliant, and the rest of the cast is very good. The plot is simple enough but the undercurrent of family relationships and how they can influence people throughout their life hit me hard. One last positive - the soundtrack is a wonderful mix of seasonal favorites old and new with the bonus of a haunting Silent Night by Sinead O'Connor (which just sent me over the teary edge) and the Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World medley by the Hawaiian singer whose name I can neither remember nor spell.Fred Claus will not make you throw out It's A Wonderful Life or even Rudolph the Reindeer, but it is heartwarming and deserves to be judged before dismissed as yet another warmed over holiday leftover.

Thanks to the movies, I've been introduced to some of my favorite books. While Rex Pickett's Sideways isn't high on that list, I enjoyed it just the same. It isn't a fantastic book and, as many have noted, it is also the rare book that is bested by the movie. It's too long, has some really unnecessary side turns that don't move the plot or provide strong cause for their inclusion, and, while it is a smart observation on humanity and relationships, it is couched in some uneven prose.Pickett's writing is overly earnest, relying on verbosity, as well as repetitious and unrealistic. Everyone is beautiful or handsome, adverbs and adjectives are overused, and descriptive items are repeated to the point of distraction. Still - the meat of the movie is there, in many cases line-by-line movie dialogue, so Pickett deserves credit just as much as Payne deserved his Oscar for adapting this uneven yet enjoyable novel for the screen.What I like about the novel is that it moved quickly and often had me laughing. Moreover, I identify strongly with the flawed characters as well as the spot-on comments regarding the folly of monogamy, marriage, and how these unnatural conventions drive us to self-destructive behavior. There are also some significant parts of this book that never made the screen, parts that unfavorably alter the cinematic versions of Pickett's quartet. It's hard to criticize the original story because the movie version omitted such critical details, but that's what happens when you come to a book from a movie.Sideways is an entertaining read for the reasons the movie was so tremendous. It's not as good, but that's not to say it isn't worth your time. Pickett has created characters that resonate with vulnerability, contradiction, humor, sympathy, and honesty. If you really love the movie, I think you'll enjoy getting the backstory and adding depth to the characters. I wouldn't recommend buying it, but you should be able to find it at your local library like I did. 3.5 stars.
