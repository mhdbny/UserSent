Raydiation is Ray J's latest attempt at establishing a formidable singing career like his big sis Brandy. His first album Everything You Want in 1997 was looked over entirely, and 2001's This Ain't A Game garnered a little attention with his one hit song "Wait A Minute" featuring Lil Kim. Besides that, Ray J has had to rely heavily on his acting career and hosting duties on BET for anybody to be aware of his existence. His unsuccessful albums of the past will have little to do with the success of Raydiation considering nobody even bought the albums to remember how bad of a singer he truly is. But if Raydiation is the first time hearing his "vocal prowess," then you're in for a huge surprise (and not one of those good surprises either).It seems Ray J is styled after a lot of soul singers that have had success in the R&B; world. But no matter who he's compared to, practically nobody sings as bad as Ray J. He enlists the help of R Kelly for "Quit Actin," but that proves nothing except that R Kelly is the only person who can succeed at sounding like R Kelly. He tries in vain at getting philosophical on "War Is Over" featuring Brandy. But I think Ray J's main problem is trying to sound convincing enough to believe any of the sexual suggestions that he puts on his songs. Like the songs "In The Mood," "Exotic," and first single "One Wish" might be good if somebody else sung the songs, but unfortunately they are all done ineffectively by Ray J. Straight garbage songs like "Sexy" featuring R&B; has-been Mya, "Unbelievable," "Let's Play House" and "Keep Sweatin" with Fat Joe should have never been included on the cd at all. "Blue High Heels" is his attempt at being seductive like Chico Debarge and "Centerview" sounds like his vocal equal TQ when he sung about being on the "Westside"The only good songs on the album are the ones where he sounds like Ralph Tresvant, namely "Anytime" and "Melody." If he was smart, he would release one of these songs to trick some of his doubtful fans into purchasing his cd. But no matter how you look at it, by no means are these two songs enough to even consider buying this album brand new. On the other hand if you like "One Wish," this may be worth paying $3 when it hits the cut-out bin or the clearance rack in a few months from now (yes, I said months...not years like most albums!). Like the medical treatment that some people have to endure, this Raydiation is something nobody wants to ever deal with in their lifetime.

Most everybody remembers the R&B; duo Groove Theory back in the 90s. Songs like "Tell Me" and "Baby Luv" commanded the airwaves. Nowadays, Amel Larrieux goes the independent route with a solo career minus her former partner Bryce Wilson. Her best solo record was Infinite Possibilities, her first release that wet the appetites of her loyal listeners. Her last album Bravebird did much the same, but was the first of her independent efforts and didn't do much for her ongoing career. Even with the drawbacks of less promotion and little press from being on a small indie label, Amel goes forward with her latest album Morning. Although not as great as her first solo album, Morning is a decent enough to check out if you're a longtime fan.The album starts off with "Trouble," a rather amateurish sound compared to her traditional cuts. "Unanswered Question" gets back on track to what most are used to hearing from Amel. "No One Else" is just as powerful as "Make Me Whole" from her first solo album. "Earn My Affection" is an okay track, but "Weary" is a great choice for what will probably amount to the only single release from the album. The title cut "Morning" reminds me of the ambient sounds of Radiohead's Kid A. "Gills And Tails" is the mellow cut that would get the most play in a lounge or jazz club. "Magic" talks about tapping into your creative side to solving everyday problems like bills, stress, and the like. "Just Once" is a fine song even though the background beat somehow reminds me of the bassline from Volume 10's "Pistol Grip Pump" somehow! The album wraps up with a rather peculiar sounding "Mountain of When."Morning is not something you would run out and get if you are just looking for any kind of R&B; album. Fans of Amel Larrieux will appreciate this album the most, as well as those who are into the more mellow, alternative R&B; scene.

The Dipset is pretty much a pointless clique these days. Never really making a real impression on the industry, they've really been lucky to even still be around. Cam'ron was the front man, and he couldn't even muster a formidable solo career when he finally got on the Roc. The creation of Dipset seemed like a desperate move to make everybody think Cam'ron really was a worthwhile rapper and leader. From the start, it seemed like Juelz Santana had just a little bit of an edge as far as charisma and skills. Juelz' first album was like most other Dipset releases and did very little in comparison to the rest of the Roc-a-fella roster. Fast forward to today and the release of his second solo album, an older and more experienced Juelz proclaims in his title that he is What The Game's Been Missing. And after one listen, you will wish that this album had stayed missing!There are a few cuts from this album that Juelz actually pulls off. "Shottas" is a pretty good mix of hip-hop and reggae with Cam'ron and Sizzla giving their flava to the song, but Juelz manages to shine better than both of them. Juelz does the same thing on "Whatever You Wanna Call It" with Hell Rell giving less than stellar lyrics on the song. "Good Times" is a passable song as well as "Gone" and "Daddy." But the rest of the album is plagued with horrible production, uninspiring verses, and little creativity."Oh Yes" gets the Cam'ron award, where Juelz has one of the most annoying choruses you will ever hear. Runner-ups for the Cam'ron award include "Kid Is Back" with kids singing the hook and "Violence" with Juelz yelling throughout the entire song like he's the lost member of M.O.P. or something! "Make It Work For You" featuring Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy is the top choice for the Noisemaker award, with production that sounds like a demo track from a Casio keyboard. Other vote-getters include "Freaky," "Changes" featuring Razah, and "Rumble Young Man Rumble." And of course the Another Bad Creation award goes to "Clockwork," a track makes no sense at all. "Kill Em" featuring Cam'ron, "There It Go (The Whistle Song)," and the ridiculous "I Am Crack" are even more examples of songs the should have never seen the light of day.Juelz Santana has been able to keep himself the most viable member of Dipset as of late. But What The Game's Been Missing falls short of even being borrowed from a clueless co-worker or a 5 for $10 sale from your local "street vendor" for that matter. Seems Juelz will have to separate himself from Dipset to even have a chance at a long career. If he chooses not to part ways, then he could end up being one of those "street vendors" selling albums from other rappers that are still in the game!

Beanie Sigel has always been one of those artists who is constantly on the verge...and with The B. Coming.....he's still one step short of becoming something more. It's not even all Beanie's fault most of the time. Usually it's the mundane production that tends to make its way on his albums that make it not "star" quality. Songs like "Flatline," "Tales Of A Hustle II," and "Wanted" (a track which makes horrible use of the classic Bon Jovi song) bring the album down tremendously. They are nothing more than examples of what not to do as far as making beats for top-level talent. And a few songs are okay in production and lyrical content, but luckily there are enough bangers on this album to save the entire project and make the disc buyable. "Gotta Have It" with Peedi Peedi (formally Peedi Crakk) is a high-energy song with lots of bang for your buck. Other notable songs include "It's On" featuring Jay-Z (naturally), the hilarious ode-to-sizzurp "Purple Rain" featuring Bun-B, and arguably the strongest song "I Can't Go On This Way" featuring Philly's own Freeway. But if Beanie is going to be the captain of the ship named Rocafella, he better have all hands on deck for his next solo effort.

The Brand New Heavies have been around for a long time....a REALLY long time. Once touted as the best soul collective to stem from the UK, the Brand New Heavies have sustained through all the lineup changes with their leading ladies as well as the constantly changing landscape of music. Putting out classic jams like "Never Stop," "Dream Come True," "Brother Sister," and "Dream On Dreamer" solidified their spot in the music industry as the real thing. Bringing back the original crew with N'Dea Davenport leading the pack, Brand New Heavies set out to be back on top. And with Get Used To It, the group truly does a great job of staying true to what fans have come to know them for.Things start off right with "We've Got," a simple rhythm that familiarizes new fans with their signature sound. "Sex God " is a track that fuses lounge singing with a up-to-date sound. N'Dea shows out on the dance-inspired "Let's Do It Again." Other knockout songs include the bouncy "I've Been Touched," the equally edgy "I Just Realized," and the Caribbean flavor of "We Won't Stop." A personal favorite has to be the horn-heavy "Right On" where N'Dea begs everyone to "bring back the funk in music." Another great track is "Music," a groove that enlightens the listener that music shouldn't be based on videos, dance routines, and the money that you can make from it.A lot of the songs on Get Used To It are just plain fun and shouldn't be looked at with a microscope. It is obvious that the focus of this album was to purely entertain the masses. It's probably not going to be touted as the best Brand New Heavies disc ever, but it is easily the most carefree album to date. Any current or former Brand New Heavies fan will still enjoy the musical joyride on Get Used To It.

Cuban Link hasn't been scene or heard from since his single "Flowers For the Dead" came out back in 2000. Amid frustrations on the delay of his solo project, Cuban Link (born Felix Delgado) reportedly confronted Fat Joe at a Q-Tip album release party and had an altercation that left him with a scar on his face and his subsequent non-affiliation with Fat Joe or Terror Squad. Five years later and with plenty of time to heal physically and mentally, Cuban Link returns with the independently released Chain Reaction.Even though nothing is wrong with any of his lyrics, the fact that it is an independent album means there are going to be limitations here and there that you wouldn't necessarily associate with a major label release. The music on Chain Reaction is okay, but there are times when it sounds clearly like a inexperienced producer was behind the mixing boards. Despite the few cases of sounding like local hip-hop production, Chain Reaction still delivers in originality and creativity when it comes to Cuban Link's unique flow. The obvious latin flavor of "Scandalous" featuring Don Omar is something few others can pull off. "No Mercy" and the title track give a glimpse of the harder edge that few have associated with something that Cuban Link would possess. "I Need To Know" is more of the mellow side of Cuban, something more familiar to former listeners of the Terror Squad standout.But even though this is an independent record, Cuban Link enlists the help of top-level talent to make this album far better than practically any album Fat Joe ever put out. "Sugar Daddy" features songstress-in-hiding Mya, "Comin' Home With Me" has the crooning of Avant, and "Life Goes On" with Syleena Johnson describes the many stuggles Cuban Link has faced in the music industry. All in all, the two tracks that stand out the most are "My Story" where Cuban resorts to spoken word to give his displeasure with how things went down with his career and "Letter To Pun" where Cuban Link professes to be the "real" twin to Big Pun and not Fat Joe. But more importantly, "Letter To Pun" is a song meant to show his love for Pun and give him a chance to tell him that he's pushing on despite the obstacles and the losses he has had in his life.Without a doubt, Cuban Link possesses such a unique rapping style and has mastered the art of songwriting enough to branch out and "ghostwrite" for other rappers. With a lyrical prowess strong enough to match that of Big Pun or anybody else in the business, Cuban Link deserves a contract with a major label and a career better than the person who tried to kill it in the first place.

The R&B World lost another balladeer a few short months ago when Gerald Levert passed away at the early age of 40. Although we will miss him, he left behind a extensive music library including an album that he had just completed at the time of his passing. In My Songs is a 12-song collection that encompasses the diverse array of sounds that we have come to love from Gerald Levert. The upbeat tracks that stand out the most are the happy-go-lucky song "Wanna Get Up With You," the charismatic "DJ Don't," and the bouncy "What Cha Think About That." His best mid-tempo songs would have to be "I Don't Get Down Like That" and "M'Lady" although "Fall Back" and "To My Head" are also respectable. But Gerald still gives the ladies a couple slow jams to cuddle up with. The title track "In My Songs" has to be one of his best ballads to date with all of the compassion that you hear from him while he's belting out his feelings. "Is This The Way To Heaven?" and "Deep As It Goes" are smooth love songs that will put anybody in the mood for some extra-curricular activity. "Hang In There" and "Sweeter" are more romantic in their approach than the other slow cuts. Gerald Levert definitely proved himself time and time again that he more than just Eddie Levert's son. He stood the test of time and garnered fans from across the globe. In My Songs is a great complement to his already huge discography. Even if no more albums are released, the world has many great songs and great memories of the man they called 'Teddy Bear'...R.I.P.

Talking about the epitome of what true Hip-Hop is lies in its foundation. And the architectural brilliance of the pioneer producer Marley Marl matched with the super rhymes of KRS-One for the LP no one expected should be a slam dunk. But Hip Hop Lives struggles to elevate the globally-embraced genre in more ways than one. KRS-One doesn't give much in the lyrical department, as evidenced on "Over 30" where there is practically no meaningful chorus or verses. And even though the concept on "Nothing New" is one that is reverberated by many , the song lacks any underlying entertainment value. "Hip Hop Lives" is well-produced and KRS-One's flow is crafted wonderfully, while "I Was There" sounds like a lot of bragging with very little substance behind the relevance of KRS-One's presence. The development of the choruses for at least half of the songs are non-existent, leaving much to be desired by the listener. "Musika" featuring Magic Juan is decent though with its Latino influence, "Kill A Rapper" asks why dead emcees always have open cases, and "The Victory" features guest vocals from Blaq Poet and turntablist Dj Premier. "House of Hits" featuring Busy Bee sounds like a jumbled mess at times while "This Is What It Is" has the potential to be a classic jam with a little tweaking. Even though both men are highly respected, little can be gathered from Hip Hop Lives. By no means should KRS-One and Marley Marl stop with this one project. Marley Marl should just change it up a little bit with regard to his beats, and KRS-One should remain focused on social commentary and speaking on rap's worth to the world. Now that would certainly reign supreme in everybody's eyes.

In the song "Teary Eyed," Missy says "you bring the worst out of me." This is probably the most truthful statement she has ever said. Missy might have thought The Cookbook was a great title for her album considering the different styles she stirs up. But ultimately this becomes a recipe for disaster. I can count on one hand how many songs are even TOLERABLE let alone good! "Lose Control" is the best "rap" song on the album. The only other okay songs are the R&B-tinged "Remember When," "Time And Time Again" and the Fantasia collabo "4 My Man." But even the American Idol's notoriety can't overshadow this horrible concoction. One listen to "On & On" or "Partytime" will have you running for the skip button. Even her blatant attempt to recreate popular songs and styles falls short. "Can't Stop" fails miserably at copying the successful Go-Go flavor of Amerie's "1 Thing" and "Click Clack" is a sad try at reproducing the Dirty South grind of Eightball and MJG's "You Don't Want Drama" (she even uses the EXACT SAME BEAT!) It's back to the cutting board....i mean...drawing board for Misdemeanor Elliot. She deserves a Jayo Felony for this one!

Ditto what I said about Beanie...except Bleek might want to step his lyrical swiftness a little. I mean, Memphis Bleek has been hanging around for a LONG time, and its almost amazing he is still even on the roster. Sure, he has modest success with each of his albums. But, I bet if you asked the average Jay-Z or Kanye West fan if they have ANY cds by Memphis Bleek over 90% of them will say they don't. I'm not even sure at this point anybody checks for Memph Bleek outside of cameo appearances on other people's songs. Freeway probably gets more props then Bleek, and Bleek is the one who was supposed to take over the empire. "Like That" is okay, and "Alright" is...well...alright. "Infatuated" sounds like a leftover Terror Squad track and "The One" is a poor attempt of getting an Ashanti-like guest vocalist to do the hook. Memphis Bleek needs to stay away from radio-friendly tracks and stay true to the rawness that he had from his early work. You're not Jay-Z...and with this being his FOURTH album...never will be in my opinion.

In My Own Words is phenomenal. That's saying a lot considering that this is a debut album from a singer who had absolutely no prior promotion or guest appearances on other major releases to help get him over to the listening (and buying) audience. Coming off the recent success of Mario's Turning Point (by the way, Ne-Yo co-wrote "Let Me Love You") and Chris Brown's self-titled LP, this young balladeer gets right to the point on this album. Ne-Yo makes his presence felt the most in his song lyrics, and he proves his worth with the release of In My Own Words.I recently called Chris Brown the future of R&B;, but Ne-Yo is giving him and others a run for their money. The breakout singles of "Stay" featuring Peedi Peedi and the infectious "So Sick" are great, but there are surprisingly many others that have potential to be singles for Ne-Yo. "Mirror" is classic request line material for those late nights. The feelgood "Let Me Get This Right" has some nice keyboard and instrumentation to accompany strong vocals from the singer. "I Ain't Gotta Tell You" could easily be a favorite album cut by those teenage girls out there. The background music in "Get Down Like That" sounds very old school and the lyrics serve as a friendly reminder to the ex girls that he's moved on to bigger and better things. His classic tales continue with smooth sound of "Let Go," the power ballad "Time," and classic 80s sound of "Sexy Love.""Sign Me Up" is a nice up-tempo cut for dancing, as well as "It Just Ain't Right" which borrows "I Call Your Name" by Debarge for the background. "When Your Mad" is the only selection that you might have a problem with since it's talking about how good a girl looks even when she is mad. Although unrealistic, "When Your Mad" still has great production which makes it tolerable. Considering most of the album is just him, Ne-Yo wasn't lying when he said it was In My Own Words. The weird thing about this album is the fact that teenagers, young adults, and the Grown And Sexy can enjoy this album. With most albums targeted for one audience, Ne-Yo and his label should have no problem with marketing this album. And with a good price point, In My Own Words should be in your own collection.

Fantasia goes for broke with her edgy self-titled sophomore album, leaving fans with an even broader perspective of her as a musical artist. Her decision to lead off with the hip-hop infused "Hood Boy" featuring Big Boi goes totally against the grain since the world knows her most for her ballads. "When I See U" is a mellow track that describes her shyness when she sees a certain someone come around. "I Nominate U" is a standout ballad that should easily be her next commercial single if the label heads have any clue what they're doing. "Baby Makin Hips" and "Not The Way That I Do" are both rather annoying, with both the singing and production. Thankfully things pick up again with the gratifying song "Only One U" where she recognizes her significant other as the good man that he is. "I Feel Beautiful" is a great possibility for a future single considering the powerful message Fantasia puts forth on this record. Things revert back to the land of questionable decisions with the over-produced "I'm Not That Type" as well as the rock-infused "Ineligible." Fantasia plays the other side of the fence with the emotionally-charged "Two Weeks Notice." Swizz Beatz gives the soul singer a nice mid-tempo track to jam to titled "Surround U," but then right after that she gives us the aptly-titled "Bore Me (Yawn)." She closes the album with the self-proclaimed 'ghetto club' track that leaves a lot to be desired titled "Sunshine" but then saves face with the raw street ballad "Bump What Ya Friends Say." Fantasia has a hard time balancing between being both a Pop superstar and the sistah who still reps for the hood. Fantasia might want to consider sticking to one thing the next time out or she could be looking at a rather unsatisfying singing career.

T.I. is the perfect example of how to turn nothing into something. Five years ago, T.I. was struggling for anybody to even listen to his album. Now, he commands the attention of all rap fans and critics alike. He's certainly matured a lot in that time, and it shows in his music and his demeanor whenever you see him doing interviews or posing for photos. He's even gone the extra mile by starring in the major motion picture "ATL." With the added exposure of the movie, now is definitely the best time to take advantage and release his latest album KING.He starts off the album with "King Back," an arrogant statement considering he many rappers that have paved the way for him to even be rapping. The difference with T.I. is that he actually is convincing in his proclamations. He brings U.G.K. on board for another Dirty South anthem titled "Front Back." The lead off single "What You Know" is strong in its delivery as well as its infectious beat. "Talkin' To You" is harder and edgier than most of the album, while "Live In The Sky" featuring Jamie Foxx is a contender to be the next radio cut. "Ride Wit Me" is one of those tracks meant for you to play in your rides on full blast on your way to the club.He makes a couple missteps with the Crystal Waters sample on "Why You Wanna" and the extremely obnoxious and hyper "Get It." No worries though since he gets back on track with "Top Back" and the posse cut "I'm Straight" with B.G. and Young Jeezy. "Stand Up Guy" is an average track to me, but I can see some people liking "Undertaker" with Young Jeezy and Young Dro for its darker mood like a lot of Southern classics from the past. The energizing "You Know Who" as well as the melodious "Goodlife" with Pharrell and Common set this album apart from a lot of other projects. The album closes with "Hello" featuring Governor, "Told You So," and "Bankhead" featuring his partners P$C. T.I. has really outdone himself with KING, and all the folks who haven't gotten on board simply need to get this album to be convinced that he is making moves to be on that coveted hip-hop throne.

This singer brings a certain realness to her music, mostly resorting to uncomplicated lyrics and a strong vocal range to get her message across to the listener. Many have never heard of her music, but Karen Bernod has been around the block a few times in her ever-growing music career. She has sung background for the likes of D'angelo, Erykah Badu, and Mary J. Blige, but she was also a featured vocalist for three songs on Incognito's No Time Like The Future as well as in concert for the group. Karen released her debut album Some Othaness For U back in 2000 and now returns to bless us with the outstanding Life @ 360 Degrees. The lounge feeling of "You" is welcoming, "Hair I Am" is cool in its delivery, and "Subway Love Game" is a carefree tale that illustrates that love can present itself anywhere. Her best work on here has to be the sultry "Comfort Zone," an enthralling escapade that is sung with the senses in mind. "Tell Em Let Em Know" is a feel-good groove, along with the pleasurable "Truth Iz" and the equally gratifying "Love Is." The same sentiments can be said about the introspective approach of "Dreamer" and "Family" where Karen shares some of her own thoughts and aspirations. Anybody seriously looking for a soul album that is nearly solid throughout, Life @ 360 Degrees is definitely your best bet. If you do some searching, you should be able to find the U.S. Version of this album for a lot cheaper.

2pac has been gone since 1997, but his music still lives on through numerous reworked and remixed pieces of his work. Sure, after Makaveli 1-10 were released, you though it wasn't possible for any more to be done with his music. Wrong! Now, with Pac's Life, the rapper's work is paired with new production and top-level recording artists. Swiss Beatz opens up the album with a remix of the song "Untouchable" with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Ashanti and T.I. appear on the title track while Snoop pops up for the remix version. Hussein, Papoose and Carl Thomas join forces with 2pac for the ominous "Dumpin'." Young Buck and Chamillionaire bring some Southern flare with "Sleep," while "Don't Sleep" features Lil Scrappy, Nutso, Yaki Kadafi, and Stormy. Yaki Kadafi pops up a couple more times for "Soon As I Get Home," "Don't Stop" with Big Syke, Hussein, Young Noble, EDI, and Stormy, and 'original' version of "Untouchable" with Hussein and Gravy. Keyshia Cole shines on the female version of "Playa Cardz Right" while Ludacris gives us the fellas version of the song. Even though there are a lot of familiar faces, it still sounds like a lot of songs 2pac wouldn't have done in the first place. But just hearing "new music" from 2pac does help keep his memory alive. It's makes you wonder, how many more albums like Pac's Life will they concoct?

There have been people far and near that consider Jazz as being a dying breed. Young listeners just don't get into that 'old time' music that our parents grew up loving and appreciating. You could ask any of them to name one John Coltrane song or one Miles Davis song, and you 'd be wasting your time. They are more interested in the latest 50 Cent song or Kanye West song. Some of us from the 'Grown And Sexy' crowd can't even relate to Jazz legends like Ella Fitzgerald or Dinah Washington, but we can tell you the latest Busta Rhymes cut is "Touch It" and recite all the words to Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di." Does that make us the bad ones for not growing up with Jazz? No, but it does make us the first ones to have to be taught what the true essence of American music really stems from. That's what I think Hidden Beach Recordings is doing with the Unwrapped series. They are trying to reconnect the musical void that has become wider than the Cumberland Gap. They are trying to get young folks interested in the Jazz sound again. This series is just the thing that's needed to remedy this wrong, and Unwrapped Volume 4 might be the best installment to date.Although not the biggest names in Contemporary Jazz were not used for any of these installments, they do have a talented bunch at the helm for all the songs on Volume 4. The people behind this latest venture include Mike Phillips, Jeff Bradshaw, Karen Briggs, Dennis Nelson, Richard Patterson, and Frank McComb. And the songs they cover aren't just hip-hop songs from today, but also the classic jams that some of us grew up on in the 80s and 90s as well. The new school is represented with smoothed out versions of The Game's "Hate It Or Love It," 50 Cent's "21 Questions" and "Candy Shop," Kanye West's "All Falls Down" and Fat Joe's "Lean Back." Some hits from the 90s include covers of Chubb Rock's "Treat Em Right," Naughty By Nature's "Hip Hop Hooray," and Busta Rhymes' "Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See." Last but not least, the Eighties are represented with Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight" (the single was released in late 1979, but the self-titled album featuring the song was released in 1980), Slick Rick's "Children's Story," and Kid 'N Play's "Rollin With Kid N Play."Unwrapped Volume 4 is a great jazz retrospective of the early beginnings of hip-hop all the way up to today's jams. The collective does a masterful job of mixing jazz and hip-hop, a move that has been replicated by other collections on the market. There have always been covers of R&B; songs, so it was only a matter of time before Rap was picked as a new ingredient to keep Jazz relevant to today's market. Hidden Beach has outdone themselves this time, arguably picking some of the best material to cover on Volume 4. There are so many possible angles they could choose for the future. (i.e. Dirty South, All Female Rappers, West Coast , Positive Rap, etc) But whatever direction they decide to go, hopefully the Unwrapped series keeps its focus on entertaining and expanding the minds of today's younger generations.

Jurassic 5 consist of Akil, Zaakir, Mark 7even, DJ Nu-Mark, Chali 2na (Cut Chemist is reportedly no longer with the group in order to pursue solo aspirations). The crew has been rockin' on the hip-hop scene since 1999 with a signature sound that the crew's fan base has come to appreciate over the years. Put on Quality Control or Power In Numbers and you hear a unique intermingling of turntable wizardry, well thought lyrics, and synchronized choruses. Having four rapping emcees would normally complicate songs, but Jurassic 5 pulls it off every time. But with the musical influence of Cut Chemist missing from their latest album Feedback, the crew resorts to Dj Nu-Mark for a few tracks as well as other producers. Unfortunately for them, this proves to be almost disastrous for the project.They start off nicely with "Back 4 U," a lead off track that puts you back in the same groove of their previous work. "Radio" flashes back to the early days of hip-hop with synthesized beats and simple lyrics. "Brown Girl" sounds a little too 'mainstream' for the group. "Gotta Understand" is tolerable, while "In The House" goes back to the funky rap sound of "Radio." "Baby Please" samples the music of Al Green and sounds forced at times. "Work It Out" features a sappy Dave Matthews Band on the chorus as well as the accompanying musical background. "Where We At" is close to some of their original work, with a taste of some more eclectic styling here and there. "Get It Together" has some odd whistling and early rock riff that distracts from the rapping from the crew. "Future Sound" is too mundane overall, while "Red Hot" is only okay since the music again deflects from the always entertaining lyricism from the four emcees. "Turn It Out" is entertaining, "End Up Like This" has some odd person chanting on the chorus, and "Canto de Ossanha" is simply an worldly instrumental stuck at the end of the album.Thankfully, the lyricism on Feedback saves this album from being a complete dud. But it certainly doesn't live up to any of their previous work nor does it demonstrate a positive outlook on future projects. Hopefully Cut Chemist will come back in the future to get the crew back on track or the remaining members of Jurassic 5 find a way to still put out a quality product...for their sake and ours.

I really didn't want to review this album. Once I saw that the title of T-Pain's album was Rappa Ternt Sanga, I immediately thought to myself...WHAT? At first I couldn't muster up enough confidence to sit through the entire album and listen intently to the songs, but then I immediately thought about all the people that might be duped into buying the album from the first single. "I'm Sprung" has some pretty good singing during the chorus, but the rest is subpar at best. And he even has to use a synthesized voice to get through the song, a practice that he would continue throughout the album by the way. So my new mission was to educate everybody on the nonsense that was clearly evident on this album. So here it goes.T-Pain opens with his first single "I'm Sprung" and then it's pretty much downhill from there. The singing on this album is so god awful, it's almost mind-boggling. "I'm In Love Wit A Stripper" is just ridiculous in every which way, and Mike Jones can't even come close to saving this song with his guest vocals. "Studio Luv" is a tale (or fairytale) of T-Pain having an escapade in the recording studio. "U Got Me" with Akon does prove that Akon isn't the worst singer after all. If you are ever in need of an immediate gut-busting laugh, play "Let's Get It On" and you're stomach will be hurting from laughing so hard at T-Pain's singing. Is there really a need to continue with this review? If you said yes, then continue reading the next paragraph."Como Estas" is a slap in the face to any Spanish-speaking person considering T-Pain can't even get the English language right to even attempt a song like this. The poetic injustice on the "Have It" interlude goes right into T-Pain's failed attempt of sounding like Seal on "Fly Away." "Goin' Thru Alot" featuring the previously absent Bone Crusher (who i suspect to be related to him with their similar looks) is T-Pain's sob story that nobody cares to listen to considering he can't hit one note during the whole song. T-Pain continues to butcher every song he sings with songs like "Say It," the absurd "Dance Floor," and another preposterous duet with Akon on "Ur Not The Same," The confusing "My Place," the mundane-sounding "Blow Your Mind," the lackluster homage to his block on "Ridge Road," the adequately-titled "I'm High," and the remix of "I'm Sprung" featuring Trick Daddy and The Youngbloodz close out the album.Clocking in at over 70 minutes of hell, Rappa Ternt Sanga needs to collect dust on the store shelves and not the shelves of your personal cd collection. If this doesn't prove to you that you shouldn't get this album, then by all means waste your hard-earned money and buy the album so T-Pain can take some vocal lessons. T-Pain should really give up on a music career and try to find another formidable job before he ends up turning some burgers!

I had the pleasure of seeing Anthony David open for India.Arie when she came here last month. And even though I had heard of the name, I hadn't heard his music. So I was truly interested in what this guy had to offer. Well, little did I know that I'd be captivated from the very first song. Song after song, I found myself enjoying every note that he played on his 6-string guitar and every lyric that he spoke. As he sat on the stool under the spotlight, I couldn't help but wonder why I had never heard his music before. Well, I actually had heard his work...unbeknownst to me. He worked on India.Arie's first album and co-wrote her latest single "There's Hope." So I really had to get my hands on his two cds. Although he has a new album called The Red Clay Chronicles, I found myself drawn to his more acoustic debut album 3 Chords & The Truth.Although not the strongest singer out there, his creativity and songwriting make up for his limited singing range. "Yes" starts off the album, instantly submerging you into his emotional magnificence. His heartfelt lyrics continue on "Heartstrings," again drawing the listener into a familiar story about wondering if somebody is worth the risk of loving wholeheartedly. The live performance of "Spittin' Game" is a brazen song about what else...spitting game! The standout track "Cold Turkey" had everybody entertained at the concert because of the wickedly funny yet sometimes factual occurrence of not being able to stop loving someone at the drop of a dime. "50/50 Love" is a decent reggae-tinged ditty, while "GA Peach" talks about the lovely ladies of Anthony David's home state. "Believe Me" is a cool, self-assured melody on trusting someone to love you the right way."Ain't Enough For Me" discusses the feeling of wanting to spend more time with that special someone, while "Cheatin' Man" speaks on making the mistake of stepping out on your woman even though you know it's the wrong thing to do. "Skyline" is a simple, subdued tale about dedicating yourself to another person. "Part Of My Life" is his renditon of the India.Arie song he co-wrote for her first album Acoustic Soul. He closes the album with the hilarious "Krooked Kop" and the the tranquil "The Water/The Fire." Do yourself a favor and pick up 3 Chords & The Truth. And if you like what you hear, there's always more with The Red Clay Chronicles.[....]

There isn't much to say about a certified classic. Boogie Down Productions was always on the pulse of conscious rap. That's why By All Means Necessary stood out as one of the most dynamic albums in rap music at the time. Other groups like Public Enemy and X-Clan were more unabashed in their delivery. KRS-One had a vision of entertaining as well as educating their listening audience.Throw on a song like "Jimmy" where the beat and the mood are both playful, but KRS-One doesn't joke around when he's telling everybody to strap up and protect themselves when jumping in the bed. As a 12-year-old boy listening to this record for the first time, I knew there was more to the material being discussed on this song and would eventually learn what he was truly talking about in later years. Other songs like "Still Number 1" and "My Philosophy" are the other standouts on this album. But the fact is that the style and sound of BDP made them stand out from the rest. The rock 'n roll edge of "Ya Slippin" was a risky move at that time considering most rappers rapped over old r&b; samples or drum beats only. The Caribbean groove of "Stop The Violence" and the uptempo groove of "T-Cha, T-Cha" are other examples of going against the grain.Criminal Minded is always the first album people blurt out as their favorite BDP album. But once his brother Scott LaRock was murdered, By All Means Necessary unearthed the conscious mind of KRS-One. If you consider yourself a true Hip-Hop fan, then you already know all of this to be true. But if you've missed a few albums during your lifetime, you should definitely complete your hip-hop collection with this album...By All Means Necessary!

The G-Unit crew haven't exactly had the best of times lately. Olivia was released from G-Unit, Lloyd Banks' album all but flopped, and 50 Cent has been incognito when it comes to his next album. And with word that has actually entertained the idea of a follow-up to Tony Yayo's album is totally beyond comprehension. So for Young Buck to put out an album amid this storm is definitely ballsy to say the least. The best thing for him to do is disassociate himself from anything to do with G-Unit even though he still reps for the collective for the time being. And outside of one song with 50, Young Buck accomplishes that feat with Buck The World, a project that further validates the rapper as a true emcee and not a fly-by-night, overnight sensation like countless others. Buck hits hard from beginning to end on this album, but he must utilize outside talent from about 2/3 of the disc. Hip-Hop artists like 8Ball & MJG and Bun B ("Say It To My Face"), Snoop Dogg & Trick Daddy ("I Ain't F@cking With U!"), and TI, Young Jeezy, and Pimp C ("4 Kings") all deliver the goods for standout tracks. Lyfe Jennings brings a little soul for "Buck The World," while Latoiya Williams shows off her uniqueness for "U Ain't Going Nowhere." But Young Buck does well on his own too, rocking solo for the hard-hitting "Push Em Back," the equally forceful "Buss Yo' Head," and the 'State of the Unit' address portrayed on "Clean Up Man." Young Buck does something that 50 and Lloyd Banks couldn't do and that's release a sophomore album that is just as good as his debut CD. Buck The World is basically for the streets, and thankfully that's probably the vision Young Buck had in mind this time out.

Disturbing The Peace's own Shawnna has been embarking on becoming an A-list rapper since her time with Infamous Syndicate back in the mid 90s. Sadly, it's been a uphill battle since day one. After getting a little buzz with her group effort, all of a sudden she was back to square one. Then one day, Ludacris signed her to DTP and things started looking up again. The DTP album came and went with little noise, and Shawnna finally got her chance to shine by herself with Worth The Weight. But then nothing happened with that album, and it seemed like this could have been the beginning of the end for her career. After another DTP album, she lucked up and found herself on the album's hottest cut "Gettin Some" and Block Music was soon created to capitalize on the single's success."Gettin Some" and the included remix version are still the strongest cuts on the album, but there are a couple others that are almost as tight. "In The Chi" with singers Johnny P and Syleena Johnson sounds like a good follow-up single. "Take It Slow" does just that with Bobby V providing the hook and Ludacris laying his stellar verse for the track. Shawnna wisely adds some flavor to "Can't Break Me" with the inclusion of her father Buddy Guy and his blues expertise. Guy also assists with the hometown anthem "Chicago" featuring Avant and poet/lyricist Malik Yusef. And even though Shawnna only has one verse on "Ghetto Fairy Tales," it does have a pounding beat and a mystery poet giving a great depiction of life in the hood.But there is a fair share of flawed material on Block Music too. "Lil Daddy What's Good" is simply wack all around with its amateurish hook and dull lyrics. "Hit the Back/Slide In" sounds like it should've been left on the cutting room floor. 8-Ball and MJG don't give much to an already grisly track titled "Candy Coated." "Roll Wit Me" sounds more like a track you'd hear from a wannabe rapper on the now defunct BET Uncut. The title track "Block Music" is oddly structured and showcases the always unbearable I-20. "Damn" featuring Smoke of Field Mob sounds like a bad imitation of Ludacris' track where he had the Austin Powers backdrop for the beat.With half of the songs being easily forgotten, Block Music is nothing special to write home about. Shawnna should still be applauded for being around longer than most other female rappers. But with a collective as mediocre as DTP and a solo career that keeps hitting a brick wall, it will be hard to get anybody's attention after this album. But with a crew where half the members are wack, Shawnna will always be one of the only bright spots out of the whole group.

The musical genius that is Timbaland has had his fair share of success with a wide range of artists. From his earlier work with Aaliyah to Jay-Z to Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado later, Timbo has worked with some of the best around. So it seemed to be a no-brainer to put out another solo album amid his new found resurgence on the music scene. So Timbaland Presents Shock Value is his latest offering with a multitude of eccentric guest artists and very little hip-hop to speak of outside of his lyrics. The lead single "Give It To Me" features Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado, two artists who have flourished since uniting with the super producer. Both give their signature Pop sound to the song, leaving very little room for the songs to be played on traditional urban stations. Most of the album follows the same formula of non-Hip-Hop beats with non-Hip-Hop cameos. Artists like alternative rock band The Hives ("Throw It On Me"), the Punk-Pop crew Fall Out Boy ("One & Only"), pop icon Elton John ("2 Man Show"), electronic artist Amar ("Bombay"), pop-R&B artist Money ("Fantasy"), electronic goth/punk duo She Wants Revenge ("Time"), and others give the album a mainstream pop radio feel that longtime fans of Timbaland will be turned off to. He even goes as far as to remix the song "Apologize" by his own Mosley Music artists OneRepublic with no verses by the rapper himself. Timbaland does give R&B signee Keri Hilson some much deserved spotlight on songs like the 'SexyBack'-inspired "Way I Are," "Scream" featuring Nicole Scherzinger of Pussycat Dolls fame, and "Miscommunication" with labelmate Sebastian. Outside of a few hip-hop guest stars like Dr. Dre and Missy Elliott ("Bounce"), Mosley Music signee Sebastian ("Kill Yourself"), and former partner-in-crime Magoo ("Boardmeeting"), Timbaland Presents Shock Value gives a lot of shock and very little value for us Hip-Hop heads. If this is the new direction for Timbaland and his Mosley Music Group, then good luck to him and his new venture. He was never a strong lyricist, but Timbaland was certainly a huge Hip-Hop producer. But with his eye on the Pop music prize, there will be little room for him to focus on Hip-Hop....for himself or other artists.

Soul music comes in different shapes and sizes, appealing to either a small population of listeners or a large cross section of R&B; fans. But when a new soulful talent comes out of left field and they aren't black, people pay attention. Look atJon B,Lisa Stansfield,Teena Marie, and other non-blacks who have made great strides for R&B; and soulful Pop music. Fast forward to today, and you'll see people likeAmy Winehouse,Christina Aguilera, and the strikingly soulful Joss Stone continuing that trend. Joss Stone started off covering old soul classics withThe Soul Sessionsand eventually released her first original album in 2004 calledMind, Body & Soul. But with dissipating buzz, Joss Stone and company felt it was necessary to re-up and try again with Introducing Joss Stone. She reportedly had more control over the sound and direction of her latest effort. And frankly, it's just as good as when mentors and more experienced personnel helped out on her previous work. The album starts off very strong with the organic, old school sound of "Girl They Won't Believe It," the infectious "Headturner," and the funky "Tell Me About It." Common pops up on "Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now" and the 'feel good' nature of "Arms Of My Baby" puts that song over as well. But the monster ballad (and a no brainer for a future single) has to be the liberating "Bruised But Not Broken," a song that has the potential to inspire many people through any tough times they may be experiencing. There are a few questionable moments on this album, namely the odd offering from Lauryn Hill on "Music" and the occasional over-singing on some of the songs. But Introducing Joss Stone is actually a good album from Miss Stone. The flow from song to song is rather seamless, giving the indication that Joss Stone either learned from previous mentors what to do...or what not to do when making an album. Now she has to seriously get her grind on because there are a lot of women in Soul Music who have those same aspirations...no matter if they are White, African-American, or Latina.

Robert Kelly continues his reign as the self-proclaimed King of R&B with the release of Double Up, a collection of songs that run the gamut from good to bad. The self-titled album track features Snoop Dogg and is a decent offering but isn't necessarily single-worthy. Nelly lends a helping hand for "Tryin' To Get A Number" while Chamillionaire adds some Dirty South flavor for the song "Get Dirty." "Leave Your Name" is a nice slow serenade, and "Freaky In The Club" is a mid-to-slow tempo groove with a touch of island rhythm. The absolutely worst creation on the cd has to be "The Zoo," filled with references to various animals, 'jungle' sounds, and Tarzan calls. He quickly redeems himself with the borrowed reworking of "I'm A Flirt" with T.I. and T-Pain (a previous rendition was included on Bow Wow's The Price of Fame album as a hidden bonus track). He then dives right into the standout smash with Usher called "Same Girl" that was originally a studio-produced track that Atlanta R&B group Nephu recorded but never legally owned. "Real Talk" sounds like the epilogue of the "Trapped In The Closet" series since it literally is all talk and no singing throughout the entire track. "Hook It Up" features Hip-Hop newcomer Huey ("Pop, Lock and Drop It") while Ludacris and Kid Rock collaborate with Kels for the misplaced "Rock Star." Keyshia Cole and Polow Da Don trade verses with R Kelly for the conversation-style song "Best Friend." He closes out the album with the bass-heavy "Rollin," the slow and sexy "Sweet Tooth," the tender melody of "Havin' A Baby," the intergalactic slow track "Sex Planet," and his powerful Virginia Tech tribute song "Rise Up." Although there are a few missteps, Double Up stands out as R. Kelly's strongest album in years.

When you think of R&B songstresses, you think of the big names like Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, Patti Labelle, and Mary J. Blige (just to name a few). But Bay Area recording artist Sakai encompasses the essence of all those that have come before her, offering a unique blend of soul-stirring music that any true fan of R&B can enjoy. Listening to her sophomore album Dream Big will be more than a casual experience. The lyrics are both honest and heartfelt, the music is well-produced and arranged, and the overall ingenuity throughout the album is something you rarely get from any of today's R&B artists. "I Like" is a feel-good track featuring the familiar guitar work of Tony Toni Tone's own D'wayne Wiggins. "Dream Big" is probably her most inspirational cut, giving any listener something to think about with their own life. "Nothin' I Can Do" is a standout single for anyone in love, followed closely by the endearing "Friendship 2 Love." "Know It By Now" is a song about cutting your losses while your ahead when it comes to a dead-end relationship, "Tired" is an edgy angst song about not being more than some guy's fling, and "Don't Touch Me Like That" actually talks about not getting intimate with someone who isn't really serious about being in love, let alone being in a true relationship. And even though Sakai is truly rooted in R&B, she isn't afraid to incorporate elements from other genres in her songs. "Get Up 2 Get Down" has a touch of rock and "Can't Bring Me Down" features moments where she's sings in French. But with her unadulterated lyrics and authentic delivery, Sakai brings out a groove in both songs that makes them just as good as any of her bona fide R&B songs. Dream Big is an album worth adding to any music connoisseur's R&B collection. Sakai is arguably one of the best unknown R&B acts of our time and one can only hope that Dream Big is only one of many offerings in this singer's promising musical career..

"Blackberry Molasses" is one of those one-hit wonders that few people actually have in their music collections. It was a hit for the R&B; group Mista on the radio in 1996, but it probably did little for the members as far as money, power, and respect. Fast forward nearly 10 years later and out comes Bobby Valentino from the group Mista making moves on his own. The truth of the matter is that Mista had a second album under super-producer Timbaland that never materialized due to management issues, so Bobby Valentino ultimately went on to college and earn a degree at Clark Atlanta University. But music was still in his blood, and Bobby Valentino was itching to jump back into the music biz and take another shot at gaining some recognition for his talents. With the help of fellow Southerner Ludacris, Bobby Valentino finally gets to share his own vision with his self-titled release and find the shine he never had a chance to capture back in the mid 90s.I have to admit, I had my doubts about Bobby Valentino from the start. True, everybody and their mommas were loving "Slow Down" but I just wasn't convinced that this album let alone Bobby Valentino deserved my hard earned money. So months went by, with no thought of grabbing his disc from the local music retailer or even the music clubs I was a member of. Then one day, I got the nerve to listen to a copy of the album after hearing "Tell Me" on the radio. With one listen, I came to the realization that I had been totally wrong about Bobby Valentino. Sure, he's not the best crooner there is in the R&B; world. But his singing still possesses that realism and coolness like a Mary J or even a Lyfe Jennings."Never Lonely" has that classic Jodeci feel to it, but doesn't come off as 'dated' considering Jodeci hasn't had an album since Mista's was out! "My Angel (Never Leave You)" tells a tale of having love and doing whatever it takes to hold on to that special someone. "Want You To Know Me" is a good tune to nod your head to and enjoy, along with songs like "Come Touch Me" and the aforementioned "Tell Me." Bobby has a bunch of good slow cuts that are great contenders for future radio singles. Some include the melodic "I'll Forgive You," "Lights Down Low," and "One Girl To Love." He even does an okay attempt at falsetto with "Love Dream" but probably should steer clear of any future efforts and stick to what works for his voice.The only songs that don't quite make the grade are the Ludacris-assisted "Give Me A Chance" and "Gangsta Love." I actually like the remix version of "Slow Down" better than the original cut (even though it does include one of Jodeci's signature lines.) Clocking in at just over an hour, Bobby Valentino is a great addition to your collection. Don't wait another day let alone another couple months like I did and basically cheat yourself out of a good album. This is pretty good stuff from a guy who is lucky to have another shot at stardom in the first place!

The songstress that brought you smash hits like "Silly" and "Let's Hear It For The Boy" resurfaces into the R&B world after having a number of years devoted to gospel music. Deniece Williams' new album Love, Niecy Style is a collection of reworked classics and an entirely new track to prove she's still got what it takes to belt out a jammin' track. She starts off with her rendition of Baby Washington's "That's How Heartaches Are Made" with help from Stevie Wonder on harmonica to bring it all together. Philip Bailey lends an assist by doing his signature background ad-libs for her interpretation of the Earth Wind and Fire classic "Love's Holiday." Deniece shines on "This Time I'll Be Sweeter," her tribute to the late Gwen Guthrie who originally wrote the song. She then sings her heart out on the Stevie Wonder tune "If You Really Love Me" and Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" before doing a knockout performance of "Cherish" by Kool And The Gang. George Benson joins her for her version of his song "Lady Love Me (One More Time)." She closes out the album strong with the brand new ballad "The Only Thing Missing Is You," a stellar rendition of Luther Vandross' "Never Too Much," and a re-recorded version of her own song "Cause You Love Me, Baby." Fans will enjoy the mix of songs as well as the arrangement of the tracks on this album. After listening to Love, Niecy Style, there will be no doubt in anyone's mind that Deniece Williams can still throw down when it comes to singing R&B

Stories of alcohol abuse and irreverence are usually the talk of male recording artists, with Courtney Love being the only exception to the rule. Enter Amy Winehouse, a British songstress who embodies the individualism of Pink, the brash of a younger Madonna, the soul of Erykah Badu, and the spirit of 1960's jazz singers on Back To Black. The animated nature of Back To Black is rarely seen these days because there is a certain stigma that goes along with it when it's attached to an entertainer. Nevertheless, Amy Winehouse embraces any comparison the media and listening public has for her. The appeal of the presumptuous "Rehab" sent the song soaring up the charts and feverishly downloaded into MP3 players by everybody and their momma. "You Know I'm No Good" is just as assertive, only this time it's Amy giving a fair warning about who she is and you'll ultimately have to deal with it. "Me and Mr. Jones" is filled with humorous (yet adult-natured) quips about a guy that's stood her up for a Slick Rick concert. She even ponders her relationship with a guy who's already taken for the song "Just Friends." And at first listen, listening to "Back To Black" might sound like she's talking about a failed relationship, but examining more closely might suggest that she's actually talking about a drug dependency. Songs like "Love Is A Losing Game" and "Wake Up Alone" are very descriptive and seem more heartfelt than just regular compositions by everyday songwriters. "Tears Dry On Their Own" captures the emotion of a one-sided break-up, but expounds the feeling that you can eventually look past it all without much disenchantment. The album closes with the enamored track "Some Unholy War," the engrossing lyrics of "He Can Only Hold Her," and a remix of "You Know I'm No Good" with Ghostface Killah giving a riveting verse filled with conviction to accompany the theme of the song. Back To Black is good, mature music that invites listeners to examine the true meaning of the songs. Amy Winehouse has a way with words, and thankfully for her....everybody's listening.

We've been waiting a little bit for Ginuwine to make his way back into the R&B; market and give these newcomers a run for their money. After exploding on the scene back in 1996 with the "gotta-grow-on-you" production of Timbaland on The Bachelor, Ginuwine made us believe in him and his career when he dropped 100% Ginuwine in 1999. Dropping gems like "So Anxious," "None Of Your Friends' Business," and "What's So Different" solidified his longevity in this music business. But Ginuwine struggles to make his name recognizable and one of the biggest in the R&B; world has always been more than a notion. With constant competition from fellow R&B; balladeers like R Kelly and Usher, he had to keep the hits coming and remain exceptional at the same time. He put out The Life in 2001, still making the ladies feel him with "Differences" and "There It Is." He kept it going with 2003's The Senior with super hits like "Stingy" and "In Those Jeans." Now it's 2005, and it seems as if Ginuwine has finally hit a brick wall with Back II Da Basics.Even though The Life and The Senior had decent sales and a few big hits, the albums themselves were less than stellar. So listening to Back II Da Basics was already something that was heavily pondered to begin with. But once it started playing, it became clear that there was very little discretion put into screening some of the decisions that were made on a few of these songs. "Betta Half" would undeniably be a stand out track if it weren't for Ginuwine hooting like an owl at the beginning of the song! "Oh Girl" has a lot of energy, but still comes off just as unconvincing as The Senior's "Hell Yeah." "Secrets" is one song he should have kept to himself with the obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "off-key" singing from artists like Pharrell. And even though Jazze Pha has a song called "Happy Hour" with Cee-Lo that is meant to be drop dead funny, his rowdiness doesn't bring much to "Secrets" at all. "The Club" is another song that is pointlessly included on the album, steering him far away from the crooning that his fans are more familiar with. "Glaze In My Eye" is tolerable, but it becomes unusually funny when you keep hearing him repeat the title throughout the whole song.There are a few good album tracks like "I'm In Love," "She's Like," "Take A Chance," and "When We Make Love" that prove that his ballads are what he should keep his focus on. Listeners are used to hearing these slow jams from Ginuwine and are probably just as frustrated with his latest release as the rest of us that have heard it. He certainly didn't go Back II Da Basics on this album, something that he should have done with the help of the obviously-absent Timbaland. Without him and some creative writing from some great R&B; composers, we might not get the real Ginuwine back for awhile.

I have been following Twista's career ever since his Runnin Off At The Mouth album when he was known as Tung Twista, and his debut video was on The Box! Even when he revised his name to Twista and put out Adrenaline Rush, most cats still didn't know too much about him. Songs like "Get It Wet" and "Emotions" garnered little recognition for the Midwesterner. He put out Mobstability with the Speedknot Mobstaz a year later with even less mainstream buzz than the previous album. After the independent release of Legit Ballin' in 1999, Twista faded into the background and waited for the right time to take on the industry again. Jump ahead five years later when Twista pairs up with a rising Chicago native named Kanye West who has the industry by the horns. Together they finally get Twista some well-deserved respect with Kamikaze. Now Twista releases The Day After to try to retain some of the newly received attention he lacked early on in his career.Kanye West isn't hovering all over this album like he was with Kamikaze, and you can tell this is the case right away. Twista goes for a pretty diverse approach this time around as if he was a newcomer on the scene or something. He conjures up his harder edge on songs like the sinister "Heartbeat" and the hedonistic "Check That H**." "Get It How You Live" is a hustler's anthem for 2005, while the dreamy "Lavish" and the childlike "When I Get You Home" features the production and vocals of Pharrell as well as Jamie Foxx singing on the latter song. Twista tries his hand at the 'screwed' phenomenon as well on the second half of the song "Holding Down The Game." "Do Wrong" with Lil Kim is impressive to say the least, and the breakout single "Girl Tonite" with Trey Songz brings back classic memories of songs by the curl-sportin' R&B; super group Ready For The World.Snoop Dogg brings down yet another album with his wearisome guest vocals on "Had To Call." The inclusion of Mariah Carey on "So Lonely" isn't a bad thing, it just doesn't fit with the rest of the songs on The Day After. Other songs that have no business on this album include the extremely jubilant "Hit The Floor" featuring Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and the ridiculous "Chocolate Fe's And Redbones" with singing done by Johnny P (who should've been left in the 90's!) Twista should have concentrated on making The Day After more focused on one direction like he did with Kamikaze. Instead, you are forced to listen to a hodgepodge of tracks that go in all different directions. Although The Day After isn't a total loss, it certainly isn't anywhere near the album we were all waiting for from Twista.

The B!t@h is back with her latest release titled The Glamorest Life. Trina's existence in the rap game was pretty much a fluke by all accounts. She reluctantly did the "answer" vocals on Trick Daddy's "Nann" back in 1998, and they both became overnight celebrities as a result of the nationwide attraction by the streets to the song. Her debut album Da Baddest B!t@h in 2000 was received by many females who could identify with her like they did with Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown years back. 2002's Diamond Princess had a little buzz with "B R Right" with Ludacris and "No Panties" with Tweet, but it still wasn't as popular as her debut album. Now we have The Glamorest Life, an album with a title that contains a made up word and unimpressive songs that leave little to be fascinated.Trina keeps her formula the same for the most part, keeping true to her raunchy lyrics and eyebrow-raising comments. "Here We Go" with Kelly Rowland jacks the beat from "Tender Love" by the Force MD's, a move that is clearly the best decision considering Trina's lackluster lyrics and Kelly's voice bordering on pure annoyance. Trina almost sounds like she's going through the motions with songs like "Don't Trip" with rumored boyfriend Lil Wayne and "Shake" with Lil Scrappy. The production on tracks like "Reach Out" and "Throw It Back" featuring Deuce Poppi are so disturbing, it should have raised a lot of red flags over how second-rate these songs really sound."Lil Mama" featuring Dre (of Cool and Dre) is a song where Dre foolishly borrows the beat from "(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow" by Tony Toni Tone and a few lyrics from "Feenin" by Jodeci. Mannie Fresh even SINGS (no, you didn't read that wrong) on the song "Da Club." Jazze Pha's obvious reworking of Tupac's "Hit Me Up" as well as countless other jacks on the song "It's Your B-Day" is enough to make any rap fanatic shake their head in disgust. With a only few album tracks sounding like traditional Trina songs, The Glamorest Life fails tremendously in every way imaginable. With another disappointing showing, it will be interesting to see if Trina will be able to convince her label to even keep her on the roster.

When you think of respected white rappers, you immediately think of Eminem and Paul Wall. Although not as flamboyant a rapper as Slim Shady, Paul Wall has made a name for himself without huge airplay or ridiculously high promotional budgets. He's still reppin' for the Dirty South and for Swishahouse with his latest album Get Money, Stay True. The album pretty much crept out with little attention from the industry or the Hip-Hop community as a whole, leaving Paul Wall to resort to word of mouth publicity only. And based on the selections on this album, the conversations should be favorable. The lead-off single "I'm Throwed" features Jermaine Dupri behind the boards as well as the hook man and comes off average at best for Paul Wall. Snoop Dogg pops up for "Everybody Know Me" while Freeway rises from the proverbial grave with the standout album track "On The Grind." Lil Keke pairs up with Paul for the Dirty South anthem of 2007 with "Break Em Off." Swishahouse labelmate Yung Redd holds his own on songs like "Get Your Paper" and "Call Me What U Want." Other well-chosen guest appearances include the raunchy female rapper Trina on "That Fire", R&B crooner Jon B on "Tonight", and Juelz Santana with a supremely good verse for "I'm Real, What Are You." With only a few missteps like the closing tracks "I Ain't Hard To Find" and "Slidin' On That Oil" featuring Expensive Taste, Get Money, Stay True is a suitable follow-up for Paul Wall. Now we can only hope that he'll get some money from the sale of this album so he can stay true in the future and not have to conform to the pressures of the industry to make a buck.

Here it is, the middle of the summer in 2006, and there is absolutely no new R&B; to check out. R&B; in America seems to be at a standstill. So naturally, you must search for some worthwhile music to check out, even if it did come out some time ago. Enter Sy Smith, the most known unknown there is when it comes to soul music. We've all heard her music or someone else singing the lyrics to the songs that she has written. You remember the theme song of the cable series Soul Food? Yep, that was her singing alongside Al Green for the show's opening number. What about the songstress that blessed numerous episodes of Ally McBeal? Her again! She even did back up singing for Usher, Brandy, and the incomparable Whitney Houston (before the diva started living up to the slogan 'This is your brain on drugs.') With all those projects as well as a slew of others, you would think that Sy Smith would be the number one soul artist in the world right now. In some people's minds, she probably is. And with The Syberspace Social, she further demonstrates her ingenuity and non-conforming approach to soul singing.Every track on The Syberspace Social has a unique flair all its own. "Fa' Sho" will put you in a funky stratosphere right away. "Time" follows suit with a trip-hop voyage led by Sy herself. "Part of the Night" features a familiar sound brought forth by ATCQ's own Ali Shaheed Muhammed. Other standout tracks include the soulful "Luvandsuch," the lounge feel of "Drop That," the toe-tapping beat of "Aquarius Rising," and the futuristic sounds of both "Turnstyles" and "No Place Like Love."Sy Smith does it like no other singer can. Some artists have tried to do albums like this and failed miserably (any later albums by Macy Gray for instance). This import-only album is worth the money if you truly are looking for an authentic one-of-a-kind soul escapade. The Syberspace Social may not be easily accessible, but it is certainly impressive enough for all to enjoy.

There are a bunch of people who are still bitter over the way Justin Timberlake handled himself with the whole Janet Jackson/Superbowl fallout. But to discount him as a singer because of it would be unfair and unjust. So going forward, this review is in no way a reflection of that incident or his involvement in the boy band N Sync. I think everybody should be considerate of artists who break the mold of what is 'expected' of them. With that said, Future Sex/Love Sounds is one of the best 'pop' albums to date. I classify it as pop because most of the songs on this project border more on dance and electronic than the R&B; genre. Nevertheless, that still doesn't mean that Future Sex/Love Sounds is not enjoyable. It's arguably one of the best albums of the year.The groove that he has throughout the album is unmistakable and quite obvious. A lot of people would then turn around and say that every song 'sounds' the same on the album. Not so. The title track starts off the album with a futuristic sound more common in electronic music, but still has a underlying beat to keep it funky. "SexyBack" is the monster single that is commanding all radio formats and being overplayed like any other number one track in recent memory. "Sexy Ladies" is a throwback to the early 80s sound with groups like The Time or Prince's funkier music. "My Love" featuring the rising rap superstar T.I. is my pick for a second single because of purely addictive music composition. "LoveStoned" is barely passable because of the beat, but the singing could've been a tad better. "What Goes Around" is a mellow, mid-tempo that suffers the same fate with a stellar background but the lyrics and delivery aren't there.Justin dives face first into the urban stratosphere with Timbaland and Three Six Mafia for "Chop Me Up." This is followed by the drum heavy groove "Damn Girl" featuring Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. "Summer Love" is a thumper for your ride just like the songs suggests in the opening lyrics. "Until The End Of Time" will remind you of Prince from its synthesized breaks, but the mellow riff and the inclusion of an orchestra makes it a Justin Timberlake original. "Losing My Way" is a tale about letting drugs take over your life, while "All Over Again" is a smooth, piano-laced cut where Justin taps into his soul and pours his heart out for another chance with a girl (Cameron Diaz, maybe?) The album then closes with a pointless bonus cut featuring Snoop Dogg called "Pose" that could have easily been left off the cd.Having sold platinum in under a month, Future Sex/Love Sounds is proof that Justin Timberlake has the staying power to have a prosperous solo career. He will probably continue to be shuffled between R&B; and Pop, but one thing that is for sure is that he knows how to make hits. And with the dynamic duo of Timberland and Timberlake, the future looks promising to say the least.

What is there not to say about this album? Jill Scott exemplifies the true essence of what real soul music is with her debut album Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds, Vol. 1. Classic tracks like "Gettin' In The Way," "He Loves Me," "The Way" and "A Long Walk" certified Jill's career in the R&B music realm. Album cuts like "Watching Me" and "Brotha" were socially conscious and conveyed a message. Others like "Exclusively," "Honey Molasses," and "Slowly, Surely" give us a heavy dose of her poetic expressions set to soulful melodies. But it was truly all about the slow songs, and cuts like "Show Me" and "I Think It's Better" stand out as album tracks just as worthy of being released as singles as her other classic material. If you don't own this album, then you should really be ashamed of yourself if you consider yourself an R&B fan. Who Is Jill Scott? If you don't already know, then maybe it's best that you take a long walk to the nearest music shop.

Everybody already knows how I feel about Boyz N Da Hood (if not, check out their review on the website!) but I thought maybe Young Jeezy would come up with something better for his solo album Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101. I guess I can be wrong about some things too! Granted, I don't have to hear the other three idiots from the group, but Young Jeezy proves absolutely nothing on this disc except my assertion that he's nothing more than a manufactured mouthpiece.Like everybody else, I'm willing to give almost anybody a fair shake when it comes to breaking into the rap business. Although there isn't much from the Dirty South that I can say I'm a fan of (besides the likes Outkast, Geto Boys, and more recently Slim Thug), there isn't much from the East Coast, West Coast, or Midwest that I've like in recent years either. It seems the quality has gone right out the door along with any standards that used to exist within the hip-hop industry in general. Young Jeezy is a perfect example of this mediocrity with so-so production and little thought put into his lyrics. Quoting 2pac and Biggie in the same verse like Jeezy does on both "Go Crazy" and "Last of A Dying Breed" is beyond unacceptable for someone who obviously wants to be respected as a true rap artist.How do you like circus music? It sounds like a straight-up carnival is going on with the song "My Hood." I can't forget about the Halloween music on "Get Ya Mind Right" where he has the nerve to proclaim to be "the realest n*gga in it." How about the mispelling of the title track "Trap Star" where he repeatedly spells it "T-R-A-P-S-T-R"? That's worst than Dan Quayle and his spelling of "P-O-T-A-T-O-E" What about the great decision to have two of the worst singers featured on your album? Well, Jeezy and company felt it was okay to feature Lloyd on the song "Tear It Up" and Akon on "Soul Survivor."The only tolerable songs on the album are the debut single "And Then What" featuring the signature Cash Money production of Mannie Fresh, "Talk To Em" and "Bang" featuring T.I. and Lil Scrappy. But with most of the songs plagued with his horrible adlibs of "Yeeeaaahhhh," "That's Riigghhtt," and a straight jack of MC Eiht's signature "Geeah," it's evident that Young Jeezy needs a little bit more motivation to expand his vocabulary. But like so many other rappers in the game, somehow he is generating a street buzz that will prolong his career well past the 15 minutes of fame he should have had. Let's Get It? Naw, more like Let's Move On!

Wu-Tang Clan has seen better times. I remember a day when you couldn't help but love everything Wu put out either as a group or individually. Remember the good ole days of Enter The Wu-Tang, Liquid Swords, Tical, Only Built For Cuban Linx, and Ironman? Now years later, the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim. Don't get me wrong, Ghostface Killah laid it down with his latest album Fishscale. But Clifford Smith a.k.a. Method Man is a totally different story. 4:21...The Day After continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling.There are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic "Is It Me" or the posthumous verse of ODB on "Dirty Mef." You can even accept songs such as the Lauryn Hill assisted "Say," the Erick Sermon produced "Gotta Have It," or even "Let's Ride" featuring Ginuwine as being decent. One thing that's become obvious is the fact that he can't hold it down alone like he did with Tical. But a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we've become accustom with from Method Man. I mean, "Somebody Done F*cked Up" has some energy, but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once.The majority of 4:21...The Day After is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both Method and his guest artists. Streetlife brings his wackness to songs like "4:20" and "Everything" (the latter also features an uninspiring verse from Inspectah Deck.) And you would think putting Method, Rza, and Raekwon on a track would be a banger, but "Presidential M.C." comes and goes without much fanfare. Other weak selections include "Konichiwa B*tches," "4Ever" featuring Megan Rochell, and "Fall Out."I honestly can't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21....The Day After except to complete their Method Man collection. This album won't get much pub from Def Jam and it seems Method Man is going through the motions at this day in his career. Everyone had high hopes for Method Man's career...but it seems like the only high he'll be getting is with a blunt.

Stevie Wonder has done it all. After decades of hits and classic material, you would think that he's had enough of the music industry. Probably just as much a profound musician as Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder possesses the true essence of what it means to be humble and selfless. His words and visions are ones you generally hear from activists, not artists. The subject matters that he picks is more to get a point across rather than selling units. And I think that's why everybody embraces him and his music because they know it's coming from a man that doesn't know the meaning of apathy. Whether it's his humanitarian work, his music, or just his presence, Stevie Wonder embodies what we all wish we could be like. A Time To Love is a snapshot of Stevie's current views and feelings, the very thing that he has done for many years.The album starts off on the right foot with the riveting "If Your Love Can't Be Moved" with Kim Burrell. It continues on with the delightful song "Sweetest Somebody I Know," a smooth groove with a theme we've grown accustom to hearing on most of his albums. "Moon Blue" sounds like a song by a lounge singer that you'd actually pay good money to listen to. This same vibe continues on songs like "How Will I Know" featuring Aisha Morris. Those that like his old sound will enjoy tunes like "From The Bottom Of My Heart," "True Love," and "Tell Your Heart I Love You." The more upbeat songs are still part of his arsenal, like the toe-tappin' "Please Don't Hurt My Baby" or the exuberant "So What The Fuss." And his inspirational songs like "Shelter In The Rain" and "A Time To Love" with songstress India.Arie round out the album nicely.Although not as solid as his monster mega hit albums of the past, it truly says a lot when Stevie Wonder can put out an album like A Time To Love decades after first hitting the music scene and still being relevant to what's going on today. His heart is filled with a soul that has been touched by many but has touched so many others in return. And A Time To Love is another example of his uncanny ease of staying in tune with today's world. Somebody should really consider doing a movie about Stevie Wonder one day.

I actually got through the entire cd, although I almost wish I hadn't! I don't know what it is about Pras and solo albums, but it's almost like he is lost without his Fugee counterparts on the tracks to save him. When there isn't someone there to guide him as far as his lyrics are concerned, he just goes off the deep end. That was his main problem with Ghetto Superstar, his debut solo album from 1998 on Ruffhouse Records. The only thing worth having from that album was the bonus disc with exclusive and unreleased Wyclef Jean tracks! This time around, he gets a little help in the production department which makes his album at least listenable. But Win, Lose, or Draw is nowhere near the success he wishes to have on his own.The title track starts the album off okay with some stellar production, but then Pras opens his mouth and ruins it to the point where it doesn't matter how good the beat is. The same can be said about a bunch of songs on the album. "Dreamin" and "One Monkey Don't Stop The Show" both incorporate some decent R&B; background singing, but then the kindergarten raps that plagues Pras' thought processes comes out again. This repeats again on "For Love" where the R&B; singer does a better job than Pras! He desperately tries his hand at being compassionate on the song "Mistakes" where he pleas for a woman to give him another chance at love.Even Wyclef Jean, who hasn't had a hit in years, brings little to the song "Angels Sing." But nothing gets as bad as "Mr. Martin," which features both the uninspired rapping of Pras alongside the tiresome singing of Akon all on one song! The calypso sounding "Party's Ova" sounds robotic when Pras proclaims "Time to turn off the lights....Party Is Over." And things go from bad to worst with "Haven't Found," where Pras borrow's the hook from U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For." He does more borrowing on "Friend A' Foe" when he uses elements from Whodini's "Friends" and "Ghetto Politics" where he uses BDP's lyric "Criminal minded, you've been blinded" to start off this horrible track. He even goes as far as pulling a chorus of kids into the mix for the song "How It Feels," an obviously overused tactic that many others have utilized fruitlessly.When the Fugees supposedly drop their reunion album in December '05, hopefully everybody will have forgotten about all the failed attempts of solo success from Pras as well as Wyclef's more recent works and Lauryn's Unplugged disc. Win, Lose, or Draw? When you compare Ghetto Superstar to this album, it's like comparing an 'F' to barely passing! Let's just say Pras didn't lose entirely with this album and leave it at that...because you certainly didn't win any brownie points from Fugee fans or the record label!

Hip-Hop has transformed into so many things that it's amazing that originals like Dj Jazzy Jeff are even still in the game. True enough, he was one half of the infamous rap duo that also featured The Fresh Prince (now Will Smith). But Jeff Townes has been doing production work the entire time, eventually forming A Touch of Jazz production company and then releasing his own material. His latest project The Return of the Magnificent is a follow-up to his original 2002 BBE offering The Magnificent and features a slew of new emcees, old Hip-Hop heads, and equally talented soul singers. Twone Dabz gives the metaphor-heavy "Hip-Hop" as well as "Go See The Doctor 2K7" where he gives a near comical account of getting 'burned' by a woman. Kel Spencer does a good job with "The Definition" while Eshon Burgundy and Black Ice ride over the smoothed-out cut "Run That Back." Chinah Blac serenades over "Touch Me With Your Handz," a track that masterfully reworks the beat for the Floetry hit "Say Yes." J Live does an okay job with "Practice" even though it sounds a bit amateurish in its delivery. Blacksmith Records' own Jean Grae takes another stab at establishing her name in the Hip-Hop arena with "Supa Jean." Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall pops up out of nowhere for the album standout "She Was So Flyy." Underrated R&B singer Raheem Devaughn says it all with the aptly-titled jam "My Soul Ain't For Sale." The Hip-Hop pioneers break out full throttle on the album as well. Posdnuos of De La Soul fame represents for the old school on "Let Me Hear U Clap," Method Man gives his lyrical assault for the groove "Hold It Down," Big Daddy Kane shows off his rawness on "The Garden," and CL Smooth showcases his signature flow for "All I Know." And newcomers like Dave Ghetto ("Come On"), Peedi Peedi of State Property fame ("Brand New Funk 2K7") and Rhymefest ("Jeff N Fess") all show and prove on the respective tracks too. The Return of the Magnificent is prime real estate for anybody looking for a well-rounded mix of old and new Hip-Hop, a sprinkling of good R&B, and a touch of Jazz.

What more can be said about Gang Starr that hasn't already been said? The group consist of one of the illest lyricist walking the face of the earth as well as a pioneer in the deejay circuit as well as the producing world. Guru and DJ Premier have established themselves as "one of the best yet," and all that has been proven time and time again. Dropping classic material from albums like No More Mr. Nice Guy, Step Into The Arena, Daily Operation, Hard To Earn, and Moment of Truth made everybody turn around and pay attention. Countless rappers and deejays can point to the dynamic duo and say that they idolized Gang Starr and their work. Now everybody can relive those moments with a comprehensive double disc titled Full Clip: A Decade of Gang Starr.This collection encompasses the group's entire career from 1989 to 1999. With over 30 cuts to lick your chops at, Full Clip provides true hip-hop heads an avenue of reflection while giving new school cats a history lesson of sorts on what a real rap career consists of. All the standards like "Take It Personal," "Words I Manifest," "Ex Girl To The Next Girl," and "Who's Gonna Take The Weight" are on here. And even though most of their songs weren't legendary, they were still better than most of the stuff coming out around the times of their release. "Dwyck" featuring Nice N Smooth is hands down one of their best crew cuts, followed by "The Militia" with Big Shug and Freddie Foxxx and "I'm The Man" featuring Jeru The Damaja and Group Home's Lil Dap. New cuts like "Full Clip" and "Discipline" as well as a few sprinkling of remixes round out the album nicely. If you consider yourself a legitimate hip-hop follower, then you should already have a copy of this masterful work in your collection (or at least the albums that all the songs come from in the first place.)

I have to make an admission...I'm not a fan of Dirty South music. But I've listened to enough to know when it is the real deal and when there is a legitimate attempt at fooling people into thinking you have talent. Boyz N Da Hood are the latest tricksters trying to use Puffy's popularity to put them over...it didn't work. The beats sound like somebody was playing with some old leftover Three 6 Mafia or Suave House beats. Some of the production even sounds like a teenage wannabe producer made the track on his Dell computer. Again, I reiterate....I'm not a fan of Dirty South music. But I can't even imagine any of these songs playing in the club or anybody bumping this in their rides and expecting you to take them seriously. "Dem Boyz" sounds like Gomer Pyle found a new career with the dreary and uninterested attitude being projected from the crew. And the Erick Sermon-produced "Gangstas" steals lyrics from Eazy-E's hood classic once again as Sermon used it on his own song "So Sweet" from his Erick Onasis album. And edgy titles like "B--ches and Bizness" and "P-ssy M.F's" are harder than the lyrics and music that emanate from the tracks themselves. With an album like this, these Boyz need to go back to the hood they came from.Charles Hubbertwww.Urban-Reviews.com

Mike Jones! Mike Jones! How many times do you have to tell somebody your name before they remember it? Three? Five? Don't tell that to MIKE JONES! Before the end of the cd, I guarantee you will hear his name at least 100 times (that's an average of 7 times a song!) not to mention the few plugs of his non-functional phone number so you can "hit him up" (why I even dialed it remains a mystery). Some people who bought Who Is Mike Jones might wish that number actually worked so that they can tell him how horrible the album really is.It's almost hard to pick out ANY good songs on this album. "Back Then" and "Still Tippin" are obvious picks since they are probably the main reason anybody was tricked into buying this album. The only other decent song is "What You Know About" featuring Paul Wall and Killa Kyleon. Besides that, all the rest of the songs either sound annoying, have weak lyrics or production, or are downright despicable. Repeating song titles in the chorus and throughout the rest of the track is a sign of straight laziness and lack of creativity. "Screw Dat," "Know What I'm Sayin," and "Turning Lane" are all examples of this horrible trend in hip-hop music as of late. And a Hip-Hop song should never have YODELING of any sort on it as demonstrated on "Cuttin' (Remix)." It's almost a guarantee that nobody getting this album expected to hear a sample of yodeling on a rap record, let alone drop their hard earned money on such a travesty either!The production on songs like "Scandalous H*es," "5 Years From Now," and "Laws Patrolling" are so ridiculous that the engineers had to have had earplugs on when putting together this album. Adding insult to injury is the sidesplitting singing of Lil Bran on all three songs. Other songs feature some of the worst singing on this planet. The biggest offender has to be "Flossin" featuring Dirty South's own Big Moe with singing so off key, you'd rather be listening to scratch a chalkboard than this mess. And the song "Type of Ni**a U Need" features more tragic crooning from Mike Jones himself! He continues the eardrum assassination on "Grandma," a song that no one could possibly tolerate...let alone Grandma!Who is Mike Jones? He's a man with a a dream like the rest of us. He's taken the first step towards that dream, but it seems the step caused him to fall flat on his face. And even yelling your name over and over again won't be enough to convince anybody to even bother remembering or caring who Mike Jones is.

The South is where it is at right now, whether you like it or not. Despite the ongoing East Coast and West Coast domination of the 80s and 90s, 2000 and beyond was all about the hip-hop scene below the Mason-Dixon line. Sure there were a lot of rap artists making noise before 2000 like Outkast, Goodie Mob, Geto Boys, UGK, and the No Limit and Cash Money camps. But the new millenium has seen the explosion of the Dirty South, leaving everybody else scratching their heads. There have even been comparisons of the South's evolution with the rise of the West Coast in the early 90s. And even though a lot of artists have quality material coming from the South (Paul Wall, Bun B, David Banner, Outkast, Trick Daddy, Slim Thug), there are still a number of acts that simply don't make the grade. Dem Franchize Boyz are a perfect example of this with their album On Top Of Our Game.Sure, it helps to have an utter genius like Jermaine Dupri to put your album out during the best possible opportunity in rap history. Nevertheless, it all comes down to the quality of work and the marketing of that product. They even had a hit song like "I Think They Like Me (remix)" featuring JD, Da Brat, and Bow Wow debuted months ago (which by the way sounds much like their previous hit "In My White Tee.") But that's the problem right there....it was months before their album was even released. Oh, and the song appearing on Young Fly and Flashy months prior didn't help either. The new single "Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It" does very little, but unfortunately it's one of the better songs on the album! There are a few decent cuts like "My Music" featuring Bun B and maybe "Stop Callin' Me." But besides those cuts and the hidden remix of "In My White Tee", there isn't much else that you can even deem listenable!"Ridin' Rims" will only appeal to those who have a fascination with spinners and the pimped-out rides. Three Six Mafia fans will enjoy the group's vocals on "Don't Play With Me," but again you already have to be a fan of their music to appreciate that song. "Bricks 4 The High" featuring Jim Jones, "You Know What It Is," "Give Props" and "Stop Callin' Me" all just sound uninteresting. "Freaky As She Wanna Be" is purely a stripper slow jam. "Suckas Come And Try Me" uses the exact same melody from 'White Tee' yet again! The last track "They Don't Like That" pretty much foreshadows the feelings most will have about this album. Listening to On Top Of Our Game by Dem Franchize Boyz is bad enough. Purchasing this 'franchise' for yourself is simply a bad investment.

You might be one of the many people who think 50 Cent is either overrated, overzealous, or just simple overexposed. For the few of you that don't know, 50 Cent has put out a book, a movie, 2 versions of his solo album, and energy drink, a video game, and countless other projects. Now heading up his G-Unit collective, 50 has a lot on his plate. So what is his first decision for the crew? Let's showcase the entire roster on the soundtrack to my movie! And that's all you will get if or when you buy the Get Rich Or Die Tryin' soundtrack. Some might consider this a smart move that anybody can get away with. But everybody isn't 50, and this collection lacks what most other soundtracks have.....variety!Listening to Get Rich Or Die Tryin' is basically like listening to another 50 cent album with a bunch of guest appearances from his G-Unit soldiers. No matter if it's a verse or simply a hook, 50 Cent literally appears on 75% of the tracks! Like my wife has been known to say, "WHO ASKED FOR THAT?" It wouldn't be so bad if the songs were actually all good, but the limited arsenal of 50's lyrical proficiency shows up on songs like "We Both Think Alike" featuring Olivia, "Window Shopper," and "I'll Whip Your Head, Boy" featuring Young Buck. "What If" has 50 trying to be reflective, still proclaiming he would "spray" somebody if they crossed him. The ever-convincing M.O.P. offer a graphic depiction on "When Death Becomes You," but it loses it's luster when 50 cent comes in to sing the hook. Mobb Deep still have the skills, but the crappy production along with the inclusion of Nate Dogg and 50 Cent on "Have A Party" is like nothing they have ever done. The same thing happens to Mobb Deep on their other track "You A Shooter" with a wack beat and 50 Cent adding nothing to the track.There are a couple cuts that stand out though. Spider Loc has a good showing with the help of 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks on "Things Change." All three reappear alongside Prodigy of Mobb Deep and the return of Murda Mase on "I Don't Know Officer." And "Hustler's Ambition" is probably the only solo cut from 50 Cent that's actually good. Get Rich Or Die Tryin' will probably go on to sell Gold or Platinum just because it's 50 Cent and not because it is actually quality material. Let's hope the G-Unit newcomers will have a chance to gain some fanfare. That'll be a hard task if the G-Unit CEO continues to hover over everything and (attempt to) rob them of the spotlight.

I have to say that I don't know a lot about Vesta. Granted, I was all of 12 years old when "Congratulations" hit the airwaves. I was listening to Run DMC, Big Daddy Kane, and Dj Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince in 1988! Nevertheless, I remember seeing Vesta on Arsenio Hall and later hearing the song on the radio. As I reflect back, I think that this was one of the first songs to influence me into listening to more R&B songs. That may be a stretch, but I remember being captivated by her vocal range. Usually, when you hear a singer try to hit high notes (like in church), it doesn't always come out so crisp. As I got older, I appreciated singers like Rachelle Ferrell, Chante Moore, and others who could hit those notes and grab your attention just by the sound of their voice. Well Vesta does the same on her latest release Distant Lover, a collection of R&B songs that aren't exactly the easiest to sing. We've all heard some questionable covers before now, but Vesta takes every song on this cd and makes it her own. The range on the the title track by Marvin Gaye alone will have you raising your eyebrows at how well she serenades the lyrics and invokes her own flavor to the song. Other standout tracks include her takes on the Bill Wither's jam "Use Me," her impressive perfection of "Free" by Deniece Williams, and her seductive, womanly touch to Babyface's "Whip Appeal" leaves you in a good mood afterwards. She brings new life to songs by Sade ("No Ordinary Love"), The Spinners ("Could It Be I'm Falling In Love") and Sly And The Family Stone ("If You Want Me To Stay.") Vesta certainly has the chops to release new material if she wants to. But like a lot of re-emerging artists, putting out a cover album like Distant Lover does its job of wetting the appetite before serving up an album of wholesome R&B goodness.

Ashanti has only been around for five years, but she has captured the world by storm despite being on the severely declining Murder Inc roster (now The Inc). The songbird is now the bread and butter of the company (Vita, Charli Baltimore, Cadillac Tah, Black Child, and Ronnie Bumps never had albums, Lloyd's first album was pretty much a dud, and Ja Rule lost his luster years ago.) With that, and the fact that there wasn't much else to put out, The Inc decided to release a collection of remixes and four new songs to keep Ashanti's name as well as the label's name out there on the market. Collectables By Ashanti is enjoyable, but provides little to get excited about.Remixes for her hits include the "Rain On Me" remix featuring Ja Rule, Charli Baltimore and Hussein Fatal, "Breakup 2 Makeup" remix with Black Child, "Only U" remix with Cadillac Tah, Merce, Ja Rule, and Black Child, "Focus" remix with ex-106th and Park host Free, "Still Down" with Cadillac Tah, and a "Rock Wit U (Awww Baby)" remix. Like I said before, there isn't much here that any regular fan can get into. Of the new songs, "Still On It" with Paul Wall and Method Man is definitely the best of the bunch. "I Found It In You" sounds like a rehashing of lyrics, "I Love You" is far from a typical Ashanti hit, and "Show You" is just plain.Ashanti had better come correct or it maybe be curtains for her career too. With Irv Gotti and his brother Chris getting acquitted from their recent court proceedings, be sure to check out how much more they can pimp out...I mean....pump out from Ashanti. Collectables By Ashanti is just that....a collectable that is meant only for die hard fans and that's it.

The first time Ludacris put out a Disturbing Tha Peace album, it wasn't pretty. Ludacris was coming off the huge success of his own album and wanted to spread his new found celebrity with some of his buddies. Unfortunately for them, the album didn't get much exposure, the songs were bland, and everybody's performance was...well...forgettable. Luda re-ups for the latest DTP effort with Shawnna, I-20, and Lil' Fate still representing. But DTP has expanded to include some newbies that make this album more tolerable for the rap fanatics and the masses to accept."Georgia" featuring Jamie Foxx and the once absent Field Mob is stellar, easily making it one of the strongest tracks on the album. "DTP For Life" showcases Ludacris, I-20, and Lil' Fate all on one track, "Gettin' Some" features Shawnna rocking it to the point that you almost contemplate listening to her solo album Worth The Weight after all, and the posse cut "Family Affair" is a good gathering of all the DTP talent that Ludacris has mustered. Other good cuts include Bobby Valentino on "Table Dance" featuring Smoke and Lil Fate, "I'll Be Around" by Shareefa is gritty yet gratifying, "You Ain't Got Enough" featuring Playaz Circle and I-20, and "Break A N*gga Off" featuring Lil Fate, Rich Boy, and the return of Gangsta Boo.You will have to skip over a couple of tracks though, as the collection isn't consistent all the way through. "Put Ya Hands Up" by Norflck sounds a bit amateurish in production and the lyrics aren't great either. The same can be said for the songs "Come See Me" featuring Smoke and Stat Quo, and "That's My Sh*t" with Field Mob, Playaz Circle, and Perfect Harmany. But the worst offense has to be the rock 'n roll track "Bloodeye" by Lazyeye, Shawn Jay, and Small World that will easily have you jubilant that it's the last cut on the album.Ludacris has had his fair share of ups and downs as a solo artist as well as trying to put his buddies and newcomers on the music scene. DTP has transformed into a major music conglomerate that rivals that of Rocafella in their glory days. And even though Rocafella isn't the same as it used to be, the name itself sells records. That's exactly what Ludacris wants for Disturbing Tha Peace, and this is definitely the step in the right direction.

The year is 1998 and the music scene is desperate for some new faces, especially hip-hop. There were a bunch of good albums as well as bad albums that year. There were certified classics like Lauryn Hill's Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Jay-Z's Hard Knock Life Vol 2, Outkast's Aquemini, Big Pun's Capital Punishment, and both It's Dark And Hell Is Hot and Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood by DMX. But then there were crappy albums like Jermaine Dupri's Life In 1472, Pras' Ghetto Superstar, ATCQ's Love Movement, and Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz's Make It Reign. Besides all the above, there was one album that deserved everybody's attention. They were the new faces on the rap scene, they had some of the most innovative lyrics out there, and they didn't have to conform to what was hot at the time to be good. The group is the Black Eyed Peas, and their album Behind The Front was one of the most overlooked albums of that year.Everybody that has jumped on the BEP bandwagon nowadays wasn't giving them the time of day when they were pushing positivity on top of the creative rhymes and humorous elements they incorporated here and there on the album. Even a fun song like "Joints and Jams" got your body moving, but they also incorporated rhymes like Taboo's "I don't need no steel to make my point" or Apl De Ap's "Maybe in time you can stop this crime," or WILL.I.AM's "We about mass appeal, no segregation." Subtle remarks like that are all over Behind The Front, a method that other enlightened rappers utilize in their own songs. Songs like the self-explanatory "Karma" and "Positivity," or the thought-provoking "Say Goodbye" are sentiments that have been said for years in all kinds of music, whether it be the folk music of the 1970s or the Self Destruction Movement of the late 1980s.There are a bunch of songs that are just meant for everybody to have fun with, like "Be Free," "What It Is," and "Head Bobs." And even though "Joints and Jams" is laced with a message here and there, it is still one of the better party cuts on the album. Fans of Elephunk and Monkey Business will connect more to this style of music than the other stuff. And even though their second album Bridging The Gap wasn't as great, it still continued most of the same elements of Behind The Front. But people like me who were die-hard fans and pushed their album on anybody that would listen ultimately weren't enough to please the label heads or line the members own pocketbooks. You really can't be too mad at them for trying to get paid, but I knew the dynamic of the group was going to change as soon as Fergie became a member. They started selling millions, getting a bunch of endorsements, selling out concerts, and gaining a fan base any artist would kill to have. That new fan base includes a very small amount (if any) of the people who stood behind them when they actually had a meaning and a purpose. However, they won't be able to go back to their original fan base if this money train they've been riding loses it's steam. Don't believe me? Then just ask Ja Rule.

Mary J is phenomenal. Plain and simple. Who else can say that they are one of the main reasons a lot of the up-and-coming Hip-Hop inspired R&B; singers are cropping up and vying for your attention on the airwaves? Everybody from Ciara to Ashanti to Teairra Mari to Nivea to whoever else you can name have one woman to thank....and she is STILL the reigning Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. Sure, she had her own obstacles along the way, both career-related and her personal battles as well. But like most strong Black women, she persevered and made due with what she had to get through. Failed relationships, overbearing producers, a demanding record label, and an equally anxious fan base all make up the huge undertaking that Miss MJB is left to handle. After a disappointing showing with Love & Life, Mary takes a step back and goes for broke with The Breakthrough, an album that undeniably puts her back on the right track.Track for track, Mary represents to the fullest. "No One Will Do" and "Enough Cryin" set the tone for the rest of the album. Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas makes a disheartening showing on "About You." This isn't because of any bogus lyrics, but rather a verse that makes you wish he was still rapping like the Peas used to do on their first two albums! Alas, we are talking about Mary J and not the man I've deemed the Black version of Sideshow Bob. "Be Without You" was probably the best choice for a radio single, with "Alone" featuring Dave Young (who sounds suspiciously like another crooner named Dave Hollister) and "Can't Hide From Luv" featuring Jay-Z as two of the best choices for follow-up singles. You know Mary had to represent for the struggle with uplifting songs like "Good Woman Down" and "Take Me As I Am" fulfilling those looking for an encouraging word or two. "Baggage" and "Ain't Really Love" are the songs dedicated to the no good men out there. And besides "Be Without You," the mushy stuff shows up on the fascinating "Can't Get Enough" and the captivating "I Found My Everything" featuring Raphael Saadiq.By no means does this review give you the whole picture, but I can't help but say that you'd really be doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing this album. It's probably the best album since the Mary album, and that's really an understatement. Mary J. Blige gives it to you and more with The Breakthrough, and hopefully her new focus will help her stick around for years to come.

LL Cool J has nothing to prove to anybody. He's been around for over TWO decades. I can't even think of one other artists that's done that and is still relevant to the game. Sure, you have a few here and there that TRY to come back but only fall flat on their faces like almost anybody else who's stuck in the past. We witnessed the explosion of rap in the late 80s into the mainstream market and the rise of the West in the early 90s. The mid 90s brought about an resurgence in the East, and by 2000 the South was starting to make moves. Now in 2006, the South has solidified its presence to the point where the East and West are left wondering what to do next. LL Cool J continues to reinvent himself to ride all these different waves, which can be good or bad. You have the die-hard fans from early in his career or the Pepsi generation who've embraced his later work. That's exactly what happens on Todd Smith, LL's 12th major release."It's LL and Santana" features some mediocre lyrics from Cool James while Juelz Santana is his usual wack self. "Control Yourself" featuring J. Lo attempts to bridge the old school with today and fails miserably. "Best Dress" featuring Jamie Foxx sounds like a throwaway track from Jamie's Unpredictable album. "Preserve The Sexy" with Teairra Mari is just as bad as his duet with J. Lo. He changes up his flow with a little Latin flare on "#1 Fan," a mistake that should never be repeated by him ever again. And his song with the charismatic ex-con Lyfe Jennings on "Freeze" sounds like they should have stayed in the studio and cranked out a better version or something.Luckily LL doesn't disappoint on the rest of the album, enlisting the help of some of the best R&B; artists in recent years as well as three surprisingly good collaborations. "Favorite Flavor" with Mary J. Blige is a knockout single, as well as his songs with 112 on "Down The Aisle" and Ginuwine on "Ooh Wee." But his best songs have to be his collaboration with newcomer Ryan Toby on "I've Changed," his pairing with the highly-energetic Freeway for the rockin' cut "What You Want," and his unconventional gospel track "We're Gonna Make It" with Mary Mary.Although there were number of lyrical potholes present, there are enough radio-friendly cuts on Todd Smith to actually promote. This album is like most other albums in his long list of releases. About half of the disc is good, and the rest of the songs is just a waste of time. So if you are a longtime supporter of LL Cool J and his music, you should cop Todd Smith for your collection as well.

I've never liked the whole idea of slapping perfect strangers together and making up a group. But when Puff Daddy (...I mean Puffy...I mean P Diddy.... I mean Diddy.....I mean....whatever!) formed his first group 'Da Band', it caught my attention. But after seeing him play them like a fiddle and basically drop them because he didn't know how to lead and manage them was just ridiculous. Nevertheless, he tried again to put together a group that could put Bad Boy back on the map (because frankly, they've been in need of some good talent for some time now). After a couple more seasons, he finally breaks out the new girl group Danity Kane. And their self-titled album actually garnered a lot of buzz on the charts, but can they truly make it work and convince everybody that they're the real deal?Not at all an R&B; group, Danity Kane settles for standard pop music for their album. "One Shot" is a good lead track for the disc, giving you a dose of what the girls are all about. "Heartbreaker" and "Want It" both follow the same formula, resorting mostly to catchy lyrics and a moderate beat pattern. The music playing behind "Right Now" is airy and simple, while the girls serenade with a silky smooth delivery that makes this a standout track. "Show Stopper" isn't the best song out there as far as impressiveness, but it's not exactly the worst either. The questionable vocal ranges used on "Hold Me Down" is saved by the bouncy, up-tempo groove and hypnotic chorus. "Ooh Ahh" is a nice dreamy song with a dose of nod factor thrown in there to keep it from being a ballad."Press Pause" has 'pop' written all over it, but it's not polished enough for it to be a radio-friendly cut. However, "Ride For You" is a great choice for the next single because it actually showcases their singing without any over-produced 'studio magic' and has some really good lyrics to match. "Touching My Body" has an annoying drum pattern and resorts to provocative material to get them over as sex symbols instead of letting it happen naturally. "Back Up" is simply over-produced, while "Stay With Me" is a delicate ballad that has the potential to be a single one day. They have the bonus cut "Sleep On It" at the end of the disc, but once again it's totally not necessary for it to be on here like most bonus tracks on albums by other artists.Surprisingly, Danity Kane actually proved to be a worthwhile project. I didn't watch the series myself, but Diddy actually did it this time. The best thing about this project is the fact that it was all singers instead of rappers and one singer. Another thing that helped this album was the decision to use other producers instead of resorting to in-house beatmakers like Da Band suffered from. But the biggest difference is the fact that the group is believable when you listen to the album. If Danity Kane goes platinum, you better believe there will be another album.....and more seasons of Making The Band.

Whether it was with Black Star or Reflection Eternal, Talib Kweli represented to the fullest. Getting praise as high as Jay-Z on The Black Album, Kweli is more than just your "favorite rapper's favorite rapper." He has a pretty solid underground and mainstream career despite the amount of album sales any of his projects have sold. His first solo effort Quality was satisfactory, but didn't match the success he had as a member of Black Star or Reflection Eternal. He revamped his approach entirely on The Beautiful Struggle by capturing a few A-listers in the industry to give his album a more commercial appeal. That move probably hurt a lot of his underground fans that he has held onto over the course of his career. Now Talib returns with Right About Now, an album deemed as a official "mixtape" but is really his attempts at recapturing his wayward fans who had reservations about his vision.The standout track is easily "Ms. Hill," an ode to Lauryn Hill and her skills as an emcee as well as a strong Black Woman (fortunately she has recently decided to rejoin The Fugees and begin doing music again). "Drugs, Basketball, And Rap" featuring Plantet Asia and Phil The Agony is a self-analysis of the Black community and affirmation that we as a people can do so much more. "Supreme Supreme" aligns Talib with his former partner Mos Def for a long-awaited Black Star reunion. Underground phemon Jean Grae showcases her unrivaled talents on "Where You Gonna Run," despite the fact that the song basically uses the same sample as Little Brother's "Hiding Place." Other independents like Papoose and MF Doom show and prove on the songs "The Beast" and "Fly That Knot," respectively.I gotta shout out Talib for showing love and dropping the Mil-town's name on the song "Roll Off Me." Overall, there is no reason why any Talib Kweli fan (past or present) wouldn't cop this record. The beats are on point, even though it would have been nice to have a Hi-Tek beat to complete the circle. Nevertheless, Right About Now is a superb collection for those that are looking for the real follow-up to Quality.

This is Round 2 for Javier, and it doesn't look like this new album will surpass the promise that he had with his first effort. He did have a modest hit with "Crazy" from his self-titled debut album. But after that, we really didn't hear too much else from that album. He did have a second single but it didn't do anything for him, and the lackluster promotion from his label didn't help much either. If you ask me, it's actually surprising that he was able to even do another album after that. Nevertheless, Javier does return with another album this is almost as enjoyable as the first. But with him still being under Capitol Records and there being so many male R&B; artists on the market right now, he has a much steeper uphill battle than he probably anticipated for his new album Left of Center.I think the biggest hurdle Javier will have will be separating himself from the crowd. The first single "Indecent Proposal" sounds like a lot of other songs on the market. Songs like "The Answer Is Yes" and "Lovin' U" are sung with a sense of conviction like he was going through something recently. "Count On Me" with Anthony Hamilton is decent but even pulling in extra help doesn't do enough to make the song stellar like many of Hamilton's other duets. "Ways I'm Feeling U" is an okay cut, along with "You're The One" and "Once We Start.""Dance For Me" sounds like he was forced to come up sappy song for radio (and the Reggaeton remix of the song at the end of the album isn't much better), "Is This Love" and "Poetry" both seem more suited for a junior high school talent show, and "Wassup" sounds like a tweaked version of "Butterflies" by Michael Jackson. And "Can I Talk To You" is another silly song with suspect production in the background. In my opinion, Javier took a huge step backwards on this album. Maybe it's because of all the other good R&B; albums by artists like Ne-Yo, Jaheim, or Jamie Foxx. But whatever it is, it doesn't look like Left of Center will be the breakout album Javier was hoping it would be.

After wowing audiences with her knock-out performance as Shug Avery in the Broadway production of The Color Purple, Elisabeth Withers had music industry insiders clamoring to sign the artist. She eventually signed with Blue Note Records, a label that has slowly grown from it's jazz and blues beginnings into a conglomerate that embodies all sorts of musical genres. That's good, because Elisabeth Withers doesn't settle for one signature sound like most artists On her debut album It Can Happen To You, you will hear inspirational melodies such as "Simple Things" alongside traditional soul ballads like the infectious "Heartstrings" and the captivating debut single "Be With You." But don't think that's all this songstress has to offer. The laidback sound of "Listen" sounds more Sheryl Crow than India.Arie, but still comes off with more soul and rhythm than you might think. Elisabeth does a respectable cover of "Wind Beneath My Wings," but she evens it out with the purely organic toe-tapper "Get Your Shoes On." She goes global with the heartening ode "The World Ain't Ready" and brings it back home with the carefree "Next To You." Elisabeth Withers offers a refreshing touch of realism that isn't as commonplace in a lot of music these days. You can hear the whole album for yourself by visiting her website. Any artist who puts their entire album out there for the world to hear before actually buying it must have some confidence in their work and their ability.

The Pimp is free! Yes, after years behind bars, the other half of UGK finally resurfaces with his first real solo album (Sweet James Jones Stories seemed like a collection of verses placed over beats and rushed onto store shelves to capitalize off of Pimp C's incarceration). It's been a long time coming after a lengthy career as the rapping partner to Bun B. After many ups and downs throughout the years, Pimp C finally has a chance to show and prove on the solo tip with Pimpalation.Things seem to start off on the right foot with "I'm Free" featuring a sample of the hook from Tom Petty's classic rock song "Free Falling." "Knockin Doorz Down" has a hard-hitting beat that more than the South can appreciate. Bun B gives a pair of verses for the Scarface-assisted "Rock 4 Rock" and "Pourin' Up" featuring 'Mr. Lucky' himself Mike Jones. Jazze Pha gives Pimp C a nice track for "The Honey" with Jody Breeze and the 'incognito' Tela. The album dips a little with "Gitcha Mind Right" and "I Don't F*ck Wit U," but picks right back up with "Working The Wheel" featuring the underrated styling of Slim Thug and "Bobby & Whitney" with 8-Ball and MJG.Webbie and Lil Boosie invade the album with their unwelcome remix of "Like That." Mannie Fresh gives us yet another 'haven't I heard that beat before' offering with "Cheat On Ya Man." "Havin Thangs 06" sees Big Mike rising from the dead (not literally) for a twist on his old school hit. Newcomer Trae and the uninspiring Chamillionaire share the mic with Pimp C for the so-so track "Overstand Me." Jazze Pha enlists Ali, Big Gipp, and Jagged Edge for the strip club track "On Your Mind." The closing cut "I Miss U" should've been reconsidered because the chorus is comprised of the hook from the old Aaron Hall hit and does nothing to help the already horrendous track.Make no mistake about it, The South showed up to support Pimp C for Pimpalation. With over 25 guest verses (that's not a misprint), it's a wonder this can even be considered one person's album! I have to admit that Pimp C is outshined a lot on this project, proving even more that he's better with Bun B than by himself. Pimpalation is not as good as Bun B's solo Trill, but both of them were merely filler albums that will help set up a monstrous comeback album by UGK.

Bow Wow is all grown up. It just seemed like yesterday we saw him in Snoop Dogg's video "Gin And Juice" as a little tyke in the doorway. We've all heard the stories of him rapping on stage during a Snoop concert when he was like 5 years old. Even then, people knew he would be a force to be reckoned with. His teenage years saw the explosion of "Lil Bow Wow" and the throngs of little girlies fallen over each other trying to set their eyes on Bow Weezie. Now we witness him as an adult with a new moniker, and judging from the lyrical content on this album, dropping the "Lil" from his name was a wise move. But, unfortunately for the rapper, he should have found some other adults to help in the direction of Wanted.Wanted isn't boiling over with vulgarity like the young adult group Pretty Ricky. But the album isn't profound in lyrical wizardry either. "Fresh Azimiz" (pronounced Fresh As I'm Is) sounds extremely dated. I guess when you have somebody like one-hit wonder J-Kwon as a guest, it won't be the best in ingenuity. Even songs like "Caviar" with Snoop Dogg, you have a hard time relating to the subject matter. "B.O.W." features a stripped down version of the beat from "Tipsy" by the aforementioned flash-in-the-pan rapper J-Kwon. "Do What U Do" features the mundane lyrics and beats of Jermaine Dupri.The production on Wanted is so bad, it's a wonder how nobody jumped up out of their seats in protest while recording these songs. "Go" is an all-out mockery of "Treat Em Right" by Chubb Rock, "Mo Money" sounds like a song by a local wannabe rapper, and "Is That You (P.Y.T)" will probably send Michael Jackson back to the courthouse to sue for defamation! The only decent songs are "Like You" by rumored girlfriend Ciara and "Let Me Love You" with Omarion. It's interesting how Bow Wow's album cover is like a Wanted poster considering that a lot of people expected him to have a budding musical career when he was older. But like a lot of kid acts in the past, sometimes you can't always get what you want.

Chris Brown is on top of the world right now. His debut single "Run It" stayed on the top of the Hot 100 for a few weeks, making all heads turn his direction just to see who this new kid on the block really is. The 16-year-old Virginian actually considered a rap career, but opted for singing after realizing the attention he caused when girls would hear his voice. I have to admit that I didn't like "Run It" when it first came out. I heard it when I saw the video one day and immediately thought of the same comparison many of you probably came up with yourselves....."He's trying to be Usher!" And because of this early rush to judgment, I kind of shunned the idea of even listening to his self-titled album. But then I saw his video for "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)" and I saw what some label heads obviously saw....potential.We've all heard "Run It" a million times. And even though it's played all over the place, the song doesn't seem cohesive like an Usher track would be. Even his live performances of the song don't impress me. But then I heard the rest of the album and realized that "Run It" is probably his worst track considering he sings out of his range on the song. Thankfully he keeps within his limits on mostly all the remaining tracks on his album. "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)" is more convincing because there is a concept behind the song, and his singing doesn't come close to any unacceptable levels. "Young Love" uses a few samples and reminds you of a bunch of other songs from the past, but Chris Brown does a good job of making it his own. Some other good songs are "Gimme That," "Ain't No Way," "What's My Name," and "Poppin." But his stand out tracks are without a doubt his more mellow cuts. "Ya Man Ain't Me," "Winner," "Is This Love" are perfect examples of his smoother side. But the best selection has to be "Say Goodbye," a song worthy enough to be his third single.Chris Brown made a believer out of me, especially once I got past the whole "He trying to be Usher" phase. And the truth of the matter is the simple fact that EVERYBODY should be trying to be the level Usher is at right now. But Chris Brown outright trying to BE him couldn't be any farther from the truth. He has his own appeal that many teenage girls have already witnessed, yet he isn't confined to just the young adult market. They just happen to be the main audience, much like a Mario or Omarion. But as soon as Chris Brown and these other cats get a little older like Marques Houston and Usher, the more mature crowd will see what these young fellas are made of. Usher came out right around the same age, and his song didn't climb up and stay at number one on the charts nor was his album sought out by every teenage girl out here. Chris Brown unquestionably has the capability of being just as big a star as Usher...if not bigger.

The 90s were a wonderful time for R&B.; Probably half of my entire R&B; collection is from the 90s. It was a time of good music. Male groups like Boyz II Men, Jodeci, and Dru Hill made a name for themselves during that time. But my, how the mighty have fallen! Boyz II Men lost their touch after awhile, Jodeci fizzled away despite having three solid albums, and Dru Hill suffered from the backlash of Sisqo's "Thong Song" and never quite recovered. But some male R&B; groups struggled more than others, and Silk was one of those who just couldn't keep afloat. Their dynamic debut Lose Control still gets rotation in my stereo every now and then. But things fell apart for awhile after that. They did manage to go platinum with Tonight, but every album since then barely made a blip on the radar. Now without their main man Lil G holding down the lead singing, Silk resorts to a lackluster covers album titled Always and Forever that nobody will want to bother with.Things seem promising at first glance with the surprisingly good cover of Switch's "There'll Never Be" and Prince's "Adore." Their rendition of Heatwave's "Always and Forever" will sound a little off for those who loved the original. "Don't Disturb This Groove" is a song originally sung by The System, but after listening to Silk's version...it becomes apparent that it should have stayed that way. The same can be said for their take on Al B. Sure's "Nite And Day" and Blue Magic's "Side Show" (the latter also appeared on their previous album Silktime).Just when you think it can't get any worse, you hear their cover of Michael Jackson's "Lady In My Life," a song that didn't sound good when Marc Nelson of Az Yet tried his hand at it for his solo album Chocolate Mood. "A Night To Remember" isn't anywhere as electrifying as when Shalamar did it. "Secret Garden" is just as unimpressive, while their rendition of The Deele's "Two Occasions" is a sigh of relief only because its the last track and the end of the verbal assault on your ears.I loved Silk in the past, but Always and Forever is nothing more than an irrational exploitation of songs that are certified classics to most R&B; lovers. To put a twist on a popular saying....if you don't have any skills to sing, don't sing anything at all!

Looks like The Queen Bee has finally done it. After more than 10 years in the business, the Notorious K.I.M. has finally done something that she has been trying to do for some time now.....convince the world that she is worthy of being in the rap business. Don't get me wrong, Lil Kim has done a lot already in the music industry as a whole. She was the standout artist from Junior Mafia, she has four solo efforts in her portfolio, and she has influenced everybody from Trina to Jacki-O to try their hand at being a raunchy female emcee. But even with all those accomplishments, she has always had a dark shadow endlessly hovering over her entire career. It's nothing to do with her dreary childhood nor her early adulthood on the streets of New York. No, this is quite simply the fact that the world knew that Biggie wrote all her lyrics...whether she will admit it or not. With the death of Biggie more than 8 years ago (R.I.P.), Lil Kim was pretty much the walking dead. Her albums after his death lacked any creativity, ingenuity, or that fiery punch that she had with her lyrics on Junior Mafia's Conspiracy or her debut release Hardcore. With The Naked Truth, Lil Kim goes for broke and puts out some of her best material in years."Spell Check" starts out the album and is easily one of the strongest songs on the album. It's almost surprising that Lil Kim can even spell, let alone put together a convincing, calculated song like "Spell Check." She introduces a little Jamaican flavor with "Lighters Up," a theme she repeats later with the song "Durty" although the former is done much better. Lil Kim rightfully retaliates back at the media and the haters with the song "Shut Up B*tch." She continues with "Whoa," a song with above average production and more thoughtful lyrics detailing her recent legal crusades. She elaborates even further on her trials and tribulations on "Slippin." She takes advantage of a clip and verse from Biggie Smalls for "All Good," but it's done in a way where it's not over the top or worthy of the "rolling eyes" we're all used to doing when she bites a Biggie lyric.The Queen Bee borrows the infamous flow of Eminem for "Quiet," a song she shares with Aftermath's rookie-of-the-year The Game. She does a good job on "I Know You See Me" where she talks up her fascination with high-ticket items and fashion, but again it's not shameless at any instance. She trades verses with T.I. on the song "Get Yours" and holds her own next to the established Dirty South lyricist. "Last Day" is a song of reflection that is common for many rappers in the industry, especially when they are facing a prison bid looming around the corner. Lil Kim does falter on a few tracks, something we are more accustom to for the majority of her previous albums. Although Bun B and Twista do a decent job, the spotty production along with Kim's lyrics are problematic on "We Don't Give A F*ck." "Gimme That" featuring Maino is another example of sloppy beats and a so-so verse from Kim. "Kitty Box" will have most frowning up from the weirdness of the entire song which is rapped like LL Cool J's "Going To Cali." Unfortunately Snoop Dogg couldn't save "Kronik" from going up in smoke in regards to being listenable.Being deemed a Hip-Hop classic is far from The Naked Truth, but this album is definitely Lil Kim's most complete album in years. And despite the negative outcome of her courtroom drama, it has definite helped put her career in perspective and concentrate more on being the best that she can be in the male-dominated rap arena. Lil Kim has laid the groundwork for her career to kick right back into gear once she is released from prison. If she gets out of jail in nine months for good behavior, she'll be released right in time to promote The Naked Truth at a summer jam near you. By that time, maybe Lil Kim will have once again earned the respect of hip hop lovers and be considered by many to be a legitimate rap artist.

Dilated Peoples has been on the rap scene a minute now with little love from the mainstream crowd. And I'm sure if you asked them, they would say that there is a double edge sword when it comes to being a successful rap act these days. They've done their fair share of touring, rocking crowds from all coasts and solidifying their existence amongst the underground scene for years to come. But with it comes the fact that they simply haven't grabbed the mainstream crowd as much as they would like. I mean, everybody wants to be a superstar and make money up the you know what! Real lyricism and staying true to your artform is a hard to do when you still have to put food on the table. Even so, Dilated Peoples do it their way and give it another try with 20/20, an album that true hip-hop heads can still appreciate.It has been said that this album was casually compiled, leaving the impression that the songs may have been previously produced or somehow pieced together. Despite these notions, 20/20 is full of songs that are just as good as tracks from their previous albums. DJ Babu does some of his best turntable magic, holding nothing back and going for broke on practically every track. Fans of the group will like the head-nodding "Back Again," an obvious entrance song for any upcoming tour dates they might have. "Alarm Clock Music" will wake anybody up with pristine lyrics from both Rakaa and Evidence and scratching from Babu. "You Can't Hide, You Can't Run" borrows an infectious sample from the old school, much like "Kindness For Weakness" featuring fellow lyricist Talib Kweli. "The Eyes Have It" is a standout cut while "Rapid Transit" featuring Krondon mixes in some dark, suspenseful music but still delivers in the lyrics department nonetheless.There are some selections that leave you a little perplexed though. "Another Sound Mission" is a little lax in production, "Satellite Radio" and "Olde English" featuring Litwit Crew alumnus Defari both come off less than stellar, and "Firepower" featuring reggae's own Capleton leaves little to be desired. "the One and Only" is far from DJ Babu's best work, and "20/20" isn't anything like classic DP cuts. With only half the album being good, Dilated Peoples have some work to do to get back to their former greatness...even if it is just on the underground scene. Who knows...maybe 20/20 was simply an album fulfillment to get them closer to getting out of their commitment to Capitol Records. Hopefully in the future, we will clearly know the reason why they would put out a less-than-focused album like 20/20.

It's almost amazing that Batman has made it this long. Yes, I said Batman because that's who I remember him being. You know you remember him as Batman from the group Immature (or later known as IMX). Some younger folks might remember him from Sister Sister too. So what has been his secret for lasting this long and still being able to maintain a relatively successful career? Well in Immature, he and the guys targeted the screaming teenage girls that instinctively gravitated to popular teenage boys. In IMX, they targeted the older teens and those young adults still not old enough to drink. Even his first debut solo album MH was geared to those same girls and maybe those that could finally get in a club. So, it seems he's basically followed the same group of girls throughout his career, and Naked is no different as all those same girlies are now in the 'Grown & Sexy' stage.It may be a shock to many people who never thought Marques Houston would end up being a serious R&B; singer. But with songs like the title track "Naked" and "Sex With You," he doesn't come off as some kid star purporting to be some sex symbol. Marques continues the smooth talking with no problem on the songs "Everything" and "Do You Mind." He has even refined his "club" sound to more agreeable tunes like "I Wasn't Ready" with a surprisingly decent verse from Rufus Blaq, a blast from the past that went virtually unknown in the mid nineties. Another carefree song is the debut single "All Because Of You" featuring Immature/IMX alum Young Rome (better known as Romeo).There are some minor missteps like "12 O'Clock" featuring the long-forgotten rapper Joe Budden, the "immature" sounding "I Like It" featuring RaRa & Dame, and the weird suggestions given on the song "Marriage." For the most part, the ballads on this album are on point and that is exactly what Marques should focus on for the future. Marques Houston has the formula for success right in the palm of his hands...he just has to make sure he works it to his advantage like he has been doing for years.

I've never bought an album by Three Six Mafia, but I've liked most of their early hits nonetheless. The more recent years haven't mustered any breakout songs that I could bob my head too. Songs like "Tear The Club Up," "Who Run It," "Playa Why Ya Hatin," and "Sippin On Some Syrup" are what most of us are used to hearing from the group. So when I heard the first single from their latest album The Most Known Unknown, I had to see if the magic was back. Although not a total waste of time, it certainly doesn't have the heavy hitters from their previous efforts."Stay Fly" has to be one of the best songs that the group has ever produced to date. The beat is infectious, the energy is there, and the signature vocals are present as well. The same sentiments can be said for a few other songs, namely "Half On A Sack", "When I Pull Up To The Club" featuring newcomer Paul Wall, and "Knock The Black Off Ya @ss" featuring the return of Project Pat. They even slow it down for the ladies with the song "P*ssy Got Ya Hooked" featuring Terror Squad's Remy Ma. "Don't Cha Get Mad" with Lil Flip is a decent cut, and the "Stay Fly (Remix)"with Slim Thug, Project Pat and Trick Daddy is passable even though the original is much better.Even though there are three tracks that aren't songs and four bonus tracks after the introduction, it still leaves another seven tracks that are questionable. The lyrics and production on "Roll Wit It" with Project Pat is nothing short of absurd. "Don't Violate" with Frayser is along the lines of previous songs, but the chorus is unconvincing. "Swervin" with Mike Jones and Paul Wall features the "screwed up" technique that is best left to the Southern newcomers and not Three Six. "Poppin My Collar" is nothing like any of their other songs, utilizing a sound that an East Coast rapper would rap over. "Hardhittaz" featuring Boogiemane is only okay, along with "Side 2 Side" and "Body Parts 3" featuring the new Hypnotize Camp Posse lineup.Although there are 4 extra bonus cuts after the outro, I'm giving them a break by not including them as this would bring the rating for The Most Known Unknown down even further. Three Six Mafia have an uphill battle ahead of them if they want to keep the fans they have and gain more in the future. With past members missing in action, it's a wonder that they still have a fan base at all. But for those that are hardcore Three Six fans, this should satisfy at least 3/6th (half) of their appetites.

A lot of people didn't even know who Van Hunt was when he hit the scene back in 2004. Never moving to the middle to please the masses, Van Hunt would rather rock out on a slow ballad than resort to having pointless cameo appearances from artists (who have nothing to do with his music) just to sell a record. Some might think that Van Hunt isn't soulful enough because he has all these rock elements incorporated into his sound. If that's the case, then Sly Stone, Lenny Kravitz, Prince, or anybody with a guitar or live instrumentation must not be soulful either. Van Hunt may have a few songs here and there that sound like the aforementioned artists, but his music is the culmination of those people's works if anything. That's why On The Jungle Floor is some of Van Hunt's best work to date.Even though his self-titled release was just as good, On The Jungle Floor solidifies his sound for those who might have been thrown off with his first offering. "If I Take You Home" begs the question of respectability for going home with someone too soon. "Hot Stage Lights" is interesting to say the least, giving some "jive turkey" anecdotes similar to something Parliament Funkadelic would sing. "Daredevil, Baby" starts as a slow, drawn-out tune that flips midway to a drum-heavy ballad. "Ride, Ride, Ride" is a head-nodding jam that probably sounds the most like Lenny Kravitz than any other song on the disc. The enjoyable "Being A Girl" follows, along with the progressive tune "Suspicion (She Knows Me Too Well)." He breaks from the norm and actually pairs up with Nikka Costa for the duet "Mean Sleep," a stand-out track in my opinion. "Priest Police" sounds a lot better than the title suggests, "Character" is reminiscent of a Curtis Mayfield classic, and the eclectic "No Sense Of Crime" might leave a few people raising their eyebrows. "At The End Of A Slow Dance" and "The Thrill of This Love" both sounds like British Rock songs from the 80s.Van Hunt closes with a few songs more in line with what fans are used to hearing. "Hole In My Heart" is a mid tempo cut much like most of the tracks from his first album while "The Night Is Young" is a slow-paced selection with a choir backing his vocals with a sound more in line with a pop rock song from the late 70s or early 80s. Any fan of Van Hunt will enjoy On The Jungle Floor with no problem. Traditional R&B; fans will continue to look at him as more of a pop rock artist. Luckily, Van Hunt knows who he is and will continue his own path to stardom regardless of anybody's opinion.

The Roc has managed to ride the turbulent wave of reorganization and realignment that has plagued the music industry the past decade. Now with a new lineup and a fresh approach, Rocafella has busted out releases by the likes of Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, and newcomer Teairra Mari (see her review next month). The Young Gunz make a sophomore attempt at stardom with their latest release Brothers From Another. This time they aren't the new guys on the music scene and have the hard task of proving their worth to the world of Hip-Hop. This album does have some decent tracks, but in the end it falls under the same trappings of most other Rocafella releases.....just average.Granted "Set It Off" is a great debut single from the album, continuing the tone they set with "Can't Stop Won't Stop" and "Friday Night" from their first album Tough Luv. Besides that and Tha Dogg Pound-influenced "Tonight," there isn't much to be excited about on this album. Most of the songs are commonplace and don't really have that standout quality we are used to hearing from Rocafella commander-in-chief Jay-Z. "Don't Keep Me Waiting (Come Back Soon)" featuring 112 isn't as powerful as their collaboration on Tough Luv's "No Better Love." Kanye West adds nothing to "Grown Man 2" and the production on "Same Sh** Different Day" is simply outlandish. The majority of the tracks are so-so, including "Don't Stop (YG Party)," "It's The Life," and "We Still Here."If these cats are supposed to be carrying the torch for the future of Rocafella, they better set their sights for more assistance from Jay-Z. Don't get me wrong...the Young Gunz have decent lyrics and production, but they just don't have the hit-making qualities that is needed to sustain a formidable rap career. In the future, these Young Gunz need a little target practice before being sent out into the world again.

This 20-year-old Virginian has the same mentality most other R&B; artists have had in recent memory..."I gotta make it." Really, this can be applied to any music genre, but it seems like the R&B; world suffers more than any of the other formats. It's almost heartbreaking when you think about the potentially long-term careers that could have been established from well deserving artists like Deborah Cox, Zhane, and Rahsaan Patterson. There are so many others like Will Downing, Dave Hollister, Kenny Lattimore, and Chante Moore that have had extensive careers but with little notoriety. Trey Songz hopes to break the mold and not fall into either category with his debut album I Gotta Make It.Although a newcomer, Trey Songz has a lot of things working for him on this album. He enlists the help of Twista on his debut single "Gotta Make It" to give some definition to his style. He continues his love for R&B; and Hip-Hop on the Scott Storch-assisted "All The Ifs In the World," the upbeat club song "Just Wanna Cut," and the track "Your Behind," a song penned by Donell Jones. When listening to the album, it actually sounds like a couple songs could have been written by or featured on an album by Donell Jones, namely "Hatin' Love" and "Kinda Lovin." But it's no secret who Trey's favorite artist is. When you listen to songs like "I Gotta Go," "From A Woman's Hand," or "Make Love Tonight," you'll feel like you're listening to an album by R Kelly. These two trends can become devastating to an artist trying to build up his own abilities of becoming a standout superstar.Despite these comparisons, Trey still sings with conviction and does it well. And songs like the seductive "In The Middle," the insightful "Cheat On You," and the delightful "Comin' For You" all sound like no one else but Trey. If you can get past the similarities, you'll really enjoy this album. But Trey might want to stick to originality when it comes to establishing a career for himself...or else he could easily be lost in the shuffle.

J Dilla a.k.a. Jay Dee passed away Friday, February 10, 2006 from complications from lupus. I started the review off this way because a lot of people don't know a lot about Jay Dee. Unless you were heavily in tune with the hip-hop scene, you may not have noticed his presence. As an early member of Slum Village, Jay Dee was instrumental in bringing older R&B; and Jazz sound back to the forefront of hip-hop music. It has always been present in rap music, dating back to "Rapper's Delight" by the Sugarhill Gang. It's been continured over the years by deejays like Pete Rock, Jazzy Jeff, Dj Premier, and most notably Kanye West. Jay Dee continued this tradition in all the music he has produced for the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, Slum Village, Pharcyde, and Common. Donuts is his last release before his untimely death and serves up some of the best instrumental music to rock your head to.It's virtually impossible for this to be like other reviews where you break down each track. Each track possesses it's own unique flavor. And even though there are some that will leave you perplexed, it still shows you the extensive amount of time it must take to find those tracks that make the cut. Jay Dee obviously did a lot of digging in the crates for some of these cuts. Still other selections are a blending of sounds and samples, almost putting you in the mind of techno or drum-n-bass music.Those that appreciate the time and energy it takes to be a deejay and producer will be enlightened from the collection on Donuts. If anything, Donuts will serve as the starting point and inspiration for the growing number of deejays and wannabe producers in the game today. Jay Dee's respect in the game didn't come over night, but he never let go of niche once he found his place in the industry. He will be truly missed by those who know of him personally, those who knew of his work, and those who will come to know his music over the years to come. Be on the lookout for a future Jay Dee album from BBE this summer. R.I.P. Jay Dee.

My boy is back! After a long hiatus (four years to be exact), Donell Jones finally dropped a gem on us. If I sound excited, it's because I am. I try not to get too personal when it comes to my reviews, but I've followed Donell Jones' career since day one! I remember getting his cd single sent to me when I was a deejay at the college radio station (I'm sure some of y'all remember "In Da Hood" playing on the radio back in 1996!) Well, he's had a sprinkling of hits here and there since then like the Stevie Wonder cover "Knocks Me Off My Feet," "You Know What's Up" with Left Eye of TLC (R.I.P.), "Where I Wanna Be" and "You Know That I Love You." Now after countless album pushbacks to put the album out at the right time, Journey Of A Gemini is non-stop escapade of delight for all to enjoy.He opens up the album with the previously leaked jam "Special Girl," a song that talks about looking for the right person to make him whole. I certainly hope they still consider this as a future single because of it's potential to be a huge hit along with the fact that it would look great as a video. "Better Start Talking" was the first official song to come from the album months ago and features Jermaine Dupri giving his expertise to the song. The new single "Gonna Be" is a mellow Michael Jackson-type ballad produced by Tim and Bob. "My Apology" is a slow grinding tune that will win over his female fan base. Probably one of his best ballads to date is "Portrait of a Woman," a song that captures the essence of a woman's influence on those around her. "Cry" talks about all the wrongs going down in every hood in America.Donell Jones has some pure love songs like "Ooh Na Na," "Feelin' You," the Usher-like sound of "Can't Wait" (he's actually written for Usher in the past, so a lot of that signature sound stems from Donell Jones anyways), and "Spend The Night." Other songs deal with relationships like the self-explanatory "Cuttin' Me Off" and the regrettable tale of "Another Life." Journey of a Gemini is remarkable in every way imaginable. This is the album I've been waiting for him to have for a long time, and I'm sure Donell Jones would say this is his best work he's done. Now the marketing geniuses up at the record label need to do everything possible to get the word out so that the entire world can realize that too.

The YoungBloodz have kept themselves in the game the last six years by showcasing their own talents to the fullest. "U-Way" and "85" on 1999's Against Da Grain provided a little blip on the hip-hop map, but the Lil-Jon produced "Damn" on 2003's Drankin' Patnaz was a stellar hit that made people pay attention to the rapping duo. It was enough to get them their first Gold album and remain on the roster at La Face Records. Fast forward to today, and the release of Ev'rybody Know Me provides some decent material, but still doesn't have the huge appeal that many other southern rappers have managed to attract.But it's not from a lack of trying by any means. The YoungBloodz represent for the A-town on songs like "Presidential," and the title track "Ev'rybody Know Me." And there are some collabos that stand out like "Datz Me" featuring Young Buck, "Diamond Rings" featuring a collaboration with West Coast's own Daz, and "It's Good" alongside a singing (and somewhat rapping) T-Boz. All the other songs are just plain and offer much to be desired. Songs like "Excuse Me Shawty" featuring Lil Scrappy has a cool beat, but the subject matter is mundane and Lil Scrappy gives little to the song. Mannie Fresh and Jazze Pha offer very minor help in production on the songs "What The Biz (If I)" and "Play Ur Position" respectively.There are other tracks that bring the album down if anything. "Sum'n Like A Pimp" almost sounds juvenile, "Grown Man" featuring Shawty Putt is annoying at best, and "Haterproof" featuring Proverb is decent until the hook comes along and kills the song. Ev'rybody Know Me sounds more like a unpolished debut album, not a third disc after already garnering some buzz from previous albums. This cd is intended to be an audience builder for the YoungBloodz. But like most other reviews with a 3 out of 5 rating, Ev'rybody Know Me can only be enjoyed if you are already a fan of the YoungBloodz.

After having unbridled success on the chitlin circuit with his gospel plays, Tyler Perry mustered up enough money, confidence, and admiration to bring his funny yet dramatic theater productions to the silver screen. After the successful debut run of Diary Of A Mad Black Woman, Perry released his second film Madea's Family Reunion with just as many accolades being hailed by fans and critics as the first movie. With this new platform, it only makes sense to compile a soundtrack that was just as dynamic. So with the Madea's Family Reunion soundtrack, Tyler Perry handpicked some of the best old school jams as well as some of the biggest names in today's Rap, R&B;, and Gospel music arenas.Brian McKnight busts out on the song "Find Myself In You," a bopper's cut that will have many listeners will compare to the late great Marvin Gaye. LL Cool J pairs off with gospel superstars Mary Mary for "We're Gonna Make It," a track that is as powerful and invigorating as an A&B; selection at church. Chaka Khan keeps the inspirational flow going with "Keep Your Head Up." Kem gives us his signature sound with a rousing duet with the virtual unknown songstress Marissa Rose on the song "Tonight" (It took a little time, but I was able to find more on Marissa Rose at the following website).The all-star ensemble of Chaka Khan, Gerald Levert, Yolanda Adams, and Carl Thomas belt out "Everyday (Family Reunion)" while Johnny Gill gives us yet another ballad with "You For Me (The Wedding Song). Will Downing steps out of his comfort zone for the danceable "I'll Be" while Rachelle Ferrell shows out as usual on "Wounds In The Way." The album comes full circle with the classic sounds of The O'Jays "Family Reunion" and Al Green's "Love and Happiness." Being one of the better soundtracks in recent memory, Madea's Family Reunion is truly songs inspired from the movie and not just a slapped-together mess like most of the offerings of the last decade or so.

Charlie Wilson has been a phenomenal voice for decades. We all know him from his days with The Gap Band, with classic songs like "Burn Rubber On Me," "Outstanding," and "You Dropped A Bomb On Me." He even generated a little buzz from his solo album Bridging The Gap with the first single "Without You" being a breath of fresh air on the radio in 2001. Fast forward to 2005, and Charlie Wilson has managed to release another solo album entitled Charlie, Last Name Wilson, this time getting more promotion and more help from fellow music artists in the industry. Unfortunately for Charlie, this move does nothing more than bring the album down.The title track was the first single from the album of the same name, but this is nowhere near his strongest song. His best songs on the album are the ones where he concentrates on actually getting out his true emotions and feelings through the song. Songs like "No Words," "Asking Questions," and "My Guarantee" keeps the focus on sounding like an R&B; legend... which is exactly what Charlie Wilson has become over time. "Thru It All" and "Cry No More" are two of his strongest tracks, showcasing his signature crooning abilities that we've all learned to love. "What If I'm The One" probably should have been his first single since it has similarities to his previous hit song "Without You."Regrettably, Charlie Wilson recruits the help of people like Twista on the song "So Hot," Will.i.am and Justin Timberlake on "Floatin," and Snoop Dogg on "You Got Nerve." All three songs are far from Charlie's comfort zone that he's held on to all these years. He's more suited for songs that are more grown-up and mature rather than trying to break into the Top Ten on 106th and Park. But even some of those songs can be done wrong if the intentions are all wrong. In the song "Magic," Charlie references magic terms like "hocus pocus" and "abracadabra" alongside lyrics like "I'll show you a trick or two." And the biggest mistake has to be his decision (or buddy R Kelly's) to rework the Guy classic "Let's Chill." Sure enough, Guy did redo the Gap Band's "Yearning For Your Love," but at least they did a good job at it!Charlie Wilson needs to center his career on pleasing those that are already used to him and his singing. If more people come around than expected, then that's fine. But don't lose sight of the very people that have followed you throughout your career and have been willing to support you by buying your albums. Charlie, Last Name Wilson is half good and half bad. That may be something that a lot of artists have gotten away with doing in their career, but I can almost guarantee no fan of Charlie Wilson thought they would ever think that he would join those ranks.

This is the album that proved to the world (as well as Black folks everywhere) that Teena Marie isn't the only white girl with soul. Proclaiming Barry White as her primary influence, Lisa Stansfield was an overnight sensation with the release of Affection. Although not solid all the way through, it's still worthy of being picked up the next time you see it in the used bin if you never bought the album. Affection had a soulful dance groove that can heard in a lot of other music by the likes of the Brand New Heavies and Soul II Soul. Classic cuts like the infectious singles "All Around The World," "You Can't Deny It," and "This Is The Right Time" will definitely have you reverting back to the easy-going times of the early 90s. And even though "All Woman" was a huge single on her follow-up album, Affection still stands the test of time as being the standout album of Lisa Stansfield's career.

The year is 1999 and you are the newest sound to the hip-hop industry. Everybody is looking for the newest breed of urban street poets to break onto the scene. The rap world is now embracing everybody from everywhere with open arms to fill the void left from the demise of two of the greatest rappers alive. Enter DMX, Eve, The Lox, and the fresh sounds of Swizz Beatz to make everything in the East Coast (and hip-hop in general) right again. They have the hottest production, the newest sounds...it's almost miraculous on how this one sound would dominate the close of the century. Fast forward to today, and most of these very same Ruff Ryders and their music are as reliable as their condom counterparts of the same name.Redemption, Vol. 4 rightfully drops the "Ryde or Die" slogan as these Ruff Ryders have long buried themselves with horrible solo efforts and subsequent sequels to their modestly successful debut collection. Even DMX has gotten himself as obsolete as his long-time rival Ja Rule. The Lox lost their credibility as a group when they pissing and moaning about Bad Boy and practically begging to be released from their contracts to run to Ruff Ryders organization exclusively. With Redemption, Vol. 4, it's gotten to the point where nobody cares anymore...and for good reason. What used to be the newest hottest production has now found its way into the land of the lost.Besides the occasionally blessings of Jadakiss and Styles P on the opening tracks, and the signature bark of DMX, this collection is nothing but a sorry attempt at resurrecting the non-existent career of Drag-On and the introductions of even more people as wack as him, namely Kartoon, Flashy, and countless others. They even go as far as to find a female rapper impersonating Eve to fill in as the First Lady probably knew better not to travel down the road that had long since ended. The album was not even listenable and fails miserably at trying to "redeem" any of the former glory the camp used to retain in its prime.

Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career. He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s. But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer. Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there. B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy. Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars. Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great. Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check."Get Your Hustle On" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead. "I Know You Know" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio. "Around The Way" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either. "Sets Go Up" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single "Rodeo" is the millennium version of "Back That [...] Up" only with a more subdued approach. Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there. "What's Happenin'" is nothing to write home about, "Loose Booty" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and "Break A Brick Down" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. "Who's Ya Daddy" is pointless, along with the annoying "Keep Talkin'" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and "Why Not." Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on "Rock Like That." The biggest shocker has to be "Addicted" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of "The Rain.")There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning. This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory. With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album. One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come.

The title Music Is My Savior is an understatement if there ever was one. After losing both parents at a young age, Mims is left with only his aspiration to be a rap superstar. After releasing his debut single "This Is Why I'm Hot" on his own, he was thrown a bone by EMI/Capitol to take the first step in his journey to accomplish his dream. Music Is My Savior is a solid first album from a virtual unknown in the music industry. Garnering some hard-hitting tracks like the aforementioned lead single and dancehall remix with Cham and Junior Reid, the deep chords of "It's Alright," the club banger "Like This" and the excessive groove factor of "Cop It" will help keep those stereos thumping in the streets all summer. The R&B-infused "Girlfriends Favorite MC" featuring fellow Capitol Records recording artist J Holiday is a decent offering, and the reflective lyrics on "Where I Belong" are both straightforward and thought-provoking. Bun B of UGK fame gives a veteran verse for "They Don't Wanna Play" while Letoya Luckett laces the hook for the introspective "Without You." There are a couple suspect cuts like "Doctor, Doctor" and "Big Black Train," but the emotional outro "Don't Cry" featuring Purple Popcorn has a hint of soft rock for the chorus. For a debut album, Music Is My Savior is a solid effort from a guy that came out of nowhere and captured the attention of rap fans everywhere. Now Mims has to convince those same fans that he's the real deal and keep from being shown the door.

Much like any other hip-hop artist that hits the scene, you're first response to hearing the name of this group is pretty much the same. Who is that? Well, the Mountain Brothers are a rap group hailing from Philly who have remained under the radar for countless years with little to no recognition from the mainstream market. Consisting of Chops on production as well as vocals, Styles (not Styles P of Lox fame), and Peril-L, this rap group stands out as one of the only Asian collectives to make a name for themselves even if they aren't a household name. Their one semi-hit "Galaxies: The Next Level" was the first song that I was exposed to when I saw them on The Box in 1998 (wow, I'm really dating myself now). I immediately ran out to get their album and discovered that they had a lot more to offer.Self, Volume 1 has so many slamming tracks, it's hard to pinpoint which ones are better. Some standouts include "Fluids," "Paperchase," "Dig It," and "Things To Do." But then there are songs that are purely for entertainment like "The Adventures Of...," the infectious track "Day Jobs," and "Oh Oh Oh," a parody of artists like 95 South and Quad City Djs who had no business dominating the mid to late 90s. And Chops is one of the best beatmakers in the underground who deserved to be a recognized producer like 9th Wonder and Hi-Tek. Mountain Brothers kind of remind you of a Black Sheep or Pharcyde. So if you like either one of those artists, you will probably enjoy Self, Volume 1 as well as their follow-up album Triple Crown. This just goes to show that you don't have to be Black to be a good rapper. Just ask The Mountain Brothers...or even Eminem or Cuban Link for that matter.

Common's Be is a certified classic. It's nothing short of amazing. The fact that a kid from the Midwest would grow up to be a famous rapper and not have to talk about slapping hoes and shooting up fools from the strip is nothing short of amazing. Just how does Common do it? Well, after Electric Circus, it's obvious he had some soul searching to do. It also helps that he got Ms. Badu out his system and concentrated on what he knows best....that grimey yet polished style that Common has had since Resurrection. Even the bonus disc is on point. (which by the way is the ONLY reason this didn't get five discs....should have just had everything on one disc). Hopefully you are just reading this review just to be reading it because there is no reason you shouldn't already have this spinning in your stereo right now. "Go" and "They Say" featuring John Legend are the supreme tracks (I'm hoping "They Say" is the next release off the album). But it almost doesn't matter what track he puts out next.....they are all stand out material. Don't call it a comeback, Common's been here for years. Even with Electric Circus in his discography, he's still unique and driven to stand up for hip-hop. Heck, he might want to rename himself UnCommon!

Kanyeezy is back...and nothing has changed in regards to his music. College Dropout was a breakout album from the Chicagoan who really shouldn't even be alive today. We've all heard the story, but that's exactly what makes this man different in every sense of the word. It's his risky demeanor that has single-handedly made this man the center of attention. From his outburst at the AMAs to the recent lashing of President Bush, Kanye is not afraid to make his views known to the world. All his fans know this is nothing out of the ordinary for Mr. West. But Late Registration has so much experimentation, even a few of his hardcore fans might be taken a little off guard.The first single alone is a perfect example of his experimentation. "Diamonds from Sierra Leone" references two different topics: The future of The Roc and (more importantly) the story of the blood diamonds. Such a serious subject matter wouldn't normally be a top 20 hit, but we are talking about a man that made "Jesus Walks" big enough to be nominated for a Gospel Award! But he also goes the extra mile when it comes to his production. "Diamonds" illustrates this perfectly, but his song "Heard Em Say" featuring Adam Levine of Maroon 5 is really out of left field. The first time listening to it might have your eyebrows looking like The Rock. But after a few listens, the song starts to grow on you more and more.Like I said in the beginning.....nothing has changed. This is signature Kanye, and his sampling of mostly pre-1980s music is still prevalent on Late Registration. Songs like "Addiction," "Hey Mama," and "Gold Digger" featuring Jaime Foxx are only a few instances of his production specialty. But his inclusion of top-level talent make this album stand out even more. Besides Adam Levine and Jaime Foxx on the aforementioned songs, Brandy returns with a vengeance on "Bring Me Down," a song that is 10 times better than their previous collaboration "Talk About Our Love." Jay-Z makes a guest appearance on the "Diamonds..." remix, Nas makes his presence known on "We Major," Cam'ron has a surprising good showing on "Gone" with Consequence pulling up the rear, and newcomer Paul Wall and College Dropout's featured artist GLC showcase on "Drive Slow."But with a brief showing of Common on the short track "My Way Home" and the virtual non-existence of The Game on "Crack Music" leaves many to wonder why they were even included on the album. And even though the skits on the album are humorous, they don't exactly fit with the content of the album and only point to Kanye's attempt to tie it in with his college theme he started with his first album. Time Magazine calls Kanye a "Class Act" on the cover of the publication, and many still think the title suits the hip-hop megastar. Although not a sophomore jink, Late Registration is Kanye's first real test at proving his worth to everybody in the rap game, the music industry, and...in some respects....society as a whole.

Many recording artists that start off young in the music business try to make their transition to more mature material as smooth as possible so that everybody can see the progression. Mario does an about face and goes full throttle on his third album Go. The biggest indicator before even opening the case is the parental advisory sticker on the album cover, a rarity in R&B music but a red flag that the subject matter isn't going to be the same as his more innocent offerings of the past. And he pulls no punches on the title track "Go," a song where Mario gets ballsy with his language for a ruffneck approach to enticing the female listeners. "Kryptonite" is the other audacious track, with most of the language coming from guest rapper Rich Boy. And "Let Me Watch" is pretty self-explanatory in subject matter, but there's no explaining the horrible flute in the background or Juelz Santana's uninteresting rap. Luckily for Mario, the rest of the album features less overt attempts at showcasing his newly-attained 'Grown And Sexy' status. "Crying Out For Me" is a great single for Mario because it incorporates a lot of his signature sound but slightly modified to appeal to his newer listening audience. "Music For Love" is even more in-line with other adult-oriented contemporaries like Usher and Marques Houston, all artists who've grown up since their years as teen heartthrobs. "Skippin" is a fun ditty where he talks about how the very presence of a certain woman is enough to get him excited. "How Do I Breathe" is the monster single produced by Stargate that everyone fell in love with last summer and provided a glimpse at Mario's more sophisticated side. "No Definition" is a decent offering, while "Why" is a good song with a good energetic flow throughout. "Lay In My Bed" sounds a bit overproduced, but the impassioned lyrics from Mario help to detract from this misstep. Listening to Mario's take on the Keith Sweat classic "Right And A Wrong Way" will not only provide proof for few naysayers of the singer's crooning abilities but you may very well like the new rendition more than the original! He closes out the album with the inspirational "Do Right." Anyone thinking that Mario wasn't the real deal will think twice after hearing this album. And even though there are some miscalculations here and there, Go is definitely his best work to date.

This is definitely a welcome surprise coming from this young cat who used to rep for his label Murder Inc to the fullest (he's now reportedly managed by Sho Nuff Entertainment with an eventual move to Jazze Pha's label in the coming year or so). And with that came a sudden switch in his musical styling, resorting more on down-to-earth ballads with a charming quality behind them instead of the rough and tough image that was basically ingrained into him. And even though the new CD is called Street Love, it isn't nearly as 'hood' as other recent offerings in the R&B market. His breakout single "You" with Lil Wayne got the kind of buzz most artists wish they could pull off on a sophomore effort. "Get It Shawty" is grimy enough for the younger crowd, but catchy enough for the club crowd to enjoy. "Incredible" will make you immediately compare Lloyd to Michael Jackson, but thankfully his charisma is more believable over an edgier urban beat than most of the futile attempts by the King of Pop. Other standouts have to be "Certified," "I Don't Mind," and "Player's Prayer" (the latter is a serious contender for the next single). "Killing Me" and "Valentine" both revert back to early M.J., "Streetlove" sounds suspiciously like "Promise" by Ciara but still delivers nonetheless, and "Hazel" uses a unique storytelling approach for the lyrics (and makes the name Hazel sound a lot better than Gertrude!). He closes out the album with "One For Me" which uses the beat from the infamous "Moments In Love" beat from Art of Noise, and Andre 3000 and Nas put it down for the "You" remix. Lloyd has his eye on the prize, and the magnetism of Street Love will certainly keep everybody looking at the rising superstar for years to come.

David Banner is back with a vengeance. He stormed on the scene a couple years back with "Like A Pimp" and the not-so-popular song "Cadillac on 22s" from his debut cd Mississippi The Album. He almost immediately released MTA2: Baptized in Dirty Water, a move that was obviously a decision by the label in a failed attempt to capitalize on the success and popularity of "Like A Pimp." The last time somebody did this in recent memory was when DMX put out his first two albums in the same year. The difference between the two is the fact that DMX had multiple tracks off his debut album that had extensive promotion before the second album even hit stores. But after a little time off and a major self-examination, David Banner makes his way back into the spotlight in hopes of expanding his fan base with Certified.From the looks of the cover for Certified, one might think that it's a more reserve David Banner this time around. By no means is this the case, thankfully. He has made his songs a little more friendly with the inclusion of some R&B; cats like Jagged Edge on "2 Fingers" and the almost-forgotten singer Case on "Thinking Of You." And songs like "F*cking" featuring Jazze Pha and the first single "Play" are centered around pleasing the female crowd that we all know loves almost any nasty hip-hop that comes out (a la "Wait/The Whisper Song" and "Get Low"). And David Banner reflects on the inequalities of the world with "My Life" featuring Sky. But that's really the only thing that is less hardcore on the album than with his previous offerings.Banner has a huge selection of guest stars on the album, a technique that practically every other music artists is utilizing these days. His best collabos have to be "Ridin" surprisingly featuring Dead Prez and Talib Kweli, "Take Your" featuring the living legend Too Short along with the versatile lyricism of Bun B, and "Gangsta Walk" with Memphis' own Three Six Mafia and 8Ball & MJG. Other decent duos would be "Treat Me Like" with Jadakiss, and "On Everything" where he trades verses with Twista. Other songs are true grimy Dirty South fare like "Certified" featuring Marcus, "Ain't Got Nothin'" with Magic and Lil Boosie, and "Bloody War" with ex-Cash Money soldier BG.There are quite a few songs that probably should've been reworked, remixed, or left off the album entirely. "Lost Souls" is the first track on the album and leaves you wondering if you should even continue listening to the rest of the album. "Westside" sounds too obnoxious and loud to even take seriously, along with the song "X-ed" with Kamikaze. And the closing song "Crossroads" featuring Grout has a hefty dose of heavy metal, something almost no one in the hood can relate to. All in all, David Banner does give a satisfying album, with a few interruptions here and there. And with the saturation of crappy albums flooding the market these days, Certified is officially worth your time and money.

I have to admit...I used to be a big G-Unit fan, especially during it's early days. I loved them even when everybody was complaining that all they ever heard at the club or from passing cars or on the radio was "In The Club" or any other 50 Cent song from Get Rich or Die Tryin' album. And when Beg For Mercy came out, it was almost admirable for me that they included Tony Yayo in the artwork despite his being locked up at the time. It was even a big deal for me when Yayo emerged on stage at the Hot 97 Summer Jam fresh from his stint in prison. Besides 50, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck have had great exposure and retail sales for their solo albums. And when word got out that Yayo was dropping his album this summer, there was a little anticipation on how well his album would stand up to his fellow Guerilla Unit counterparts. After hearing Thoughts of A Predicate Felon, maybe somebody should have thought about not even putting out an album that is almost as bad as 50 Cent's Massacre.Where do I start? How about the silly song titles that Yayo probably thought were perfectly fine. I mean, these are supposed to be thoughts of a predicate felon, right? If you proclaim to be this hardcore gangsta or hardened criminal, why in the world would you have a song called "Tattle Teller" on your album? Didn't that end in 2nd grade? I mean, you have songs like the G-Unit collabo "We Don't Give A F*ck" and "Live By The Gun," but then you have a song called "Tattle Teller" like you about to run to the teacher or something.Or how about all the singing on this album? When have you known a "predicate felon" to come out of jail and start singing? Lyfe Jennings is a great example of a singer from the pen, but he ain't trying to be a hardcore rapper and LL Cool J at the same time like Tony Yayo is. Yayo sings the melody of Suzanne Vega's "Tom's Diner" (you know....the Duh Duh Deh Duh song) on "G-Sh*t", sings Gregory Abbott's song "Shake You Down" on his debut single "So Seductive", and he sings New Edition's "Mr. Telephone Man" on "Eastside Westside" as if he should have been Bobby Brown's replacement and not Johnny Gill.Last but certainly not least is the horrendous production on this album. No thought was put into the beats used on this substandard project. The song "It Is What It Is" has a beat that sounds like the Atari game "Pitfall" when the character is swinging across the vines. "Love My Style" sounds like a reject song from Massacre considering it sounds like it could be used for a black version of the movie Psycho. And I can't begin to tell you how ridiculous the G-Unit-assisted "I Know You Don't Love Me" sounds. The quality sounds like it came straight from a demo tape from 2001 or something. The only songs worth listening to are "Curious" with Joe (although Yayo gives us a sample of his exquisite singing on here too), the signature production of Eminem on "Drama Setter" featuring Eminem and Obie Trice, and "Project Princess" with Jagged Edge. With 2 of 3 good songs featuring R&B; (neither of them with G-Unit's own Olivia by the way), it's a wonder if Yayo can even manage a song by himself! But no matter how you add it up, 3 okay songs out of 17 tracks doesn't make for a good album under any circumstances. Tony Yayo may want to solicit some better production and lyrics from somebody that can make him sound like he actually made it into high school.

I must disclose upfront that I as well as my wife are both HUGE Maysa fans...so this review is probably going to be a little bias (hey, at least I admit it...unlike some reviewers!) Nevertheless, Maysa has decided to expand into doing other types of albums. Such is the case with Sweet Classic Soul, a collection of carefully crafted remakes of some of the best songs of the last half century. A lot of artists don't even attempt to try their hands at doing covers, while other artists who have no business even thinking about doing one fail miserably. Being the strong vocalist that she is, Maysa pulls off these songs without breaking a sweat.Her cover of "Wishing On A Star" is just as strong as Rose Royce's original version. "Don't Say Goodnight" is a good spin on an old classic. Such is the case for her rendition of Stevie Wonder's "All I Do." The fact that Maysa would even cover "Love Won't Let Me Wait" by Major Harris is truly wonderful. "Come Go With Me" is not as strong as Teddy Pendergrass' original, but it still passes as a decent shot at doing such an timeless classic. The same can be said for the Stylistics' "Betcha By Golly Wow," a cover that was done better by Prince some years ago. She does belt out a pretty good version of "Playing Your Game, Baby" by Barry White. She closes out the album with her take on "Love Comes Easy," "Any Love" (not Luther's version), and "The First Time (Ever I Saw Your Face)."Even though she stuck to some older material, Maysa does an exceptional job on most of the song choices that she did make. Hopefully with the release of Sweet Classic Soul, Maysa will do other specialized collections like a live album or even a duets disc.

Being a top artist means that your work is highly-anticipated, your music stands the test of time, and your personal life has usually been intruded by unwelcome and sometimes undeserving allegations. Such is the case with Ne-Yo, a young man who's seen the good with his rock solid debut album In My Own Words as well as the bad with allegations about his sexuality and beefs with other R&B artists. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters to most is whether or not you can deliver a good album that's worthy of our $9.99 the first week it comes out. Well fans around the world will be happy when they take home Because Of You since this follow-up cd does just that and more. The title track is signature Ne-Yo and was the most obvious choice to be the first single from the album. Def Jam president Jay-Z gives a brief rap intro for "Crazy," but Ne-Yo does a wondrous take on early Michael Jackson for his delivery. The clean-handed "Can We Chill" is safe enough for radio, but the emotional depictions of "Go On Girl" could very well make it the next single. "Do You" is a nice album cut, along with the boisterous "Ain't Thinking About You." Jennifer Hudson does a great job on "Leaving Tonight," cementing her worth to the music industry and giving her fans an appetizer before her upcoming solo release. Other decent cuts include the airy feel of "Angel," the provocative approach of "Say It," and the straightforwardness of "Make It Work." With "Sex With My Ex" and "Addicted" being the only sub-par tracks, Because Of You encompasses emotion that a lot of R&B fans want.

Spawning her career in the early 90's with her self-titled debut, Toni Braxton was lucky to break out from the success of the movie Boomerang with the song "Love Shoulda Brought You Home." Originally slated for Anita Baker, "Love Shoulda Brought You Home" was cut as a demo by Braxton for Baker, but a pregnant Anita Baker passed on the project and suggested Toni Braxton instead. Luck was definitely on Toni Braxton's side despite the fact that she was departing from the group she had formed with her sisters to pursue her solo career. But luck might not have anything to do with her success considering all the other hits from that 1993 debut release like "Another Sad Love Song," "Breathe Again," "Seven Whole Days," "How Many Ways," and "You Mean The World To Me." This was followed up with Secrets in 1996 with more great tracks like "Un-Break My Heart," "You're Makin' Me High," "How Could An Angel Break My Heart," "I Love Me Some Him," "Let It Flow," and "I Don't Want To." The reason I bring up these two great albums is because they are two crowning jewels to Toni's career and practically guaranteed she'd be around for a long time making hit albums left and right. But like any other artist on LaFace, it was just a matter of time before that dark cloud would come hovering above Toni's head. A few album delays, a bankruptcy, some bad label promotion, and the blessing of two babies were all the fuel she needed to jump ship and join Blackground/Universal for her latest release Libra.Having gone from multi-platinum success to moving next door to 'has-been' city, you would think Toni would have at least enlisted the help she needed to resuscitate her career. But Libra is nothing more than another mediocre Toni Braxton album. The debut single "Please" looked visually appealing when the video was released, but something about mid-to-up tempo songs doesn't gel well for Toni. It happened with her last album with the song "Hit The Freeway" featuring Loon barely cracking the Billboard Hot 100. She has a bunch of lackluster songs like this on the album, like "What's Good" and "Midnite." She even enlists the same producer of Amerie's hot single "1 Thing" to basically do a bad imitation for the song "Take This Ring."She does her best work when she sticks to the ballads (except for the aptly-titled "Stupid" which her husband helped compose). "I Wanna Be (Your Baby)" is one of the albums best and rightly so considering Babyface penned it for her. The well-crafted "Trippin" is closer to a mid-tempo song, but I can see this being played during a late-night request hour on the radio. The second best song on the album would be "Sposed To Be" with a close parallel to her earlier masterpieces. "Finally" and the album's closing song "Shadowless" are so-so, not giving much more to an already split album.I can't really suggest this album to the casual R&B; aficionado, but any die-hard admirer of Toni Braxton's music will enjoy most of this album. Toni still has the potential in her to be a top-notch singer once again. She just needs to focus on her ballads, tweak her mid-tempo tracks, and get with a label that's actually going to promote your work. Libra is simply an album that a fan could only enjoy, so everybody else should keep their hands away from it in the music store! That also goes for anybody that is a Libra that thinks it would be cool to have an album with shows off their zodiac sign. Believe me, Toni Braxton doesn't even represent her true self well enough on this album.

The career of Beyonce has been orchestrated since she was a little tot. Early girl groups materialized into the massively successful Destiny's Child who sold millions of records and packed arenas across the world. Then the natural progression to her first debut album Dangerously In Love proved to be a huge success as well. Now having been inspired by her role in the upcoming Dreamgirls movie, Beyonce threw together B'day in mere weeks without her manager/father Matthew Knowles having a clue about it. For someone who has taken calculated steps all these years to all of a sudden do something this mind-boggling can easily spell disaster....and it's spelled B-D-A-Y!"Deja Vu" with Jay-Z is a decent track, but seeing the video for this song makes it lose some credibility. "Get Me Bodied" is an odd title and an equally odd song that should've been left off this album. "Suga Mama" is just as bad with Beyonce sounding like a buzzard trying to hit high notes. Jay-Z reappears on "Upgrade You," but he doesn't give much to a cut that starts off sub-par anyways. "Ring The Alarm" is downright obnoxious and unbearable to even listen to because of her 'over-singing' along with her yelling the other half of the song. "Kitty Kat" is tolerable, but she has a tough time holding your attention until the end of the song. "Freakum Dress" is another peculiar track that should've been thrown in the studio trash can. "Green Light" is not even worth the listen, while "Irreplaceable" is a respectable 'pop' ballad that probably would be better on Kelly Rowland's next solo album. "Resentment" is another power ballad, but this one is a little more suitable for Beyonce. She closes the album with the repeat offering of "Check On It" with Bun B and Slim Thug and a super power ballad that serves as a hidden bonus track titled "Encore For The Fans."Beyonce should have taken her time putting together her second album instead of jumping into the studio and cramming a disc together just because. To suggest to someone not to bother with B'day is an understatement. You'll get more enjoyment from Letoya Luckett's debut album or Rihanna's latest release than this cd. Sorry B...but it's true.

Mobb Deep have been grinding since I can remember. Even in the early days of The Infamous, they were known to the true hip-hop heads but struggled to be acknowledged from the mainstream and had modest sales on practically every album they put out. Now they sign their life away for a paycheck with Blood Money, an album the puts the loyalty of all Mobb Deep fans to the test. It's not like Mobb Deep had this impeccable rap career that was ballin' out of control or something. After the lackluster showings of the mediocre offerings of Infamy and Amerikas Nightmare, Mobb Deep had hit a wall with their career. Most other artists would have ended up back in the hood wondering what happened to their career. Luckily for them, 50 Cent had a lifeline for them and they became millionaires overnight according to them. However, they'll have a tough time convincing the masses that Blood Money is worth the paper it's printed on.The few standout tracks include "Speakin So Freely," "Daydreamin'," and "Put Em In Their Place." "Outta Control" (Remix) with 50 Cent is a good '50 Cent' song with Mobb Deep bringing up the rear with their cameo appearance. "It's Alright" with 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige lives up to the song title when it comes to judging how good this song is.Some of the worst stuff has to be "Creep" with 50 Cent, "Have A Party" with 50 Cent and Nate Dogg, and "Pearly Gates" with 50 Cent (figure out the pattern here?). Other wack joints include "Capital P, Capital H," "Backstage Pass," "Give It To Me" featuring Young Buck, "Click Click" with Tony Yayo, and "In Love With The Moulah." Mobb Deep has never been this wack before. They definitely don't need 50 Cent's expertise to put together a decent album, but I guess they need 50's checkbook to line their pockets. Who can blame them? Wouldn't you put out a wack album for a million dollars, even if it turned out to be Blood Money?

In one of the biggest moves in hip-hop history, Outkast sets out to make themselves even more unique than any other rappers by putting together a major motion picture with not only serious acting but with a musical backdrop. The movie itself features names like Cicely Tyson, Ving Rhames, Terrence Howard, Patti Labelle, Ben Vereen, Macy Gray, Paula Jai Parker, Malinda Williams, Faizon Love, and others. The unofficial soundtrack to the movie (most songs aren't in the movie) showcases just as many cameos alongside Andre 3000 and Big Boi. So really, this is truly another Outkast release like Stankonia or ATLiens only its somewhat tied to their movie. Like other projects, Idlewild gives us yet another unique side to the duo.The debut singles "Mighty O" and "Morris Brown" are about as eclectic as they get. "Mighty O" features Andre 3000 and Big Boi sharing the mic over a eccentric beat while "Morris Brown" comprises of Big Boi rhyming in overdrive as he attempts to keep up with the marching band accompaniment. This sounds like a lot already, but that's a flash in the pan compared to the rest of the album. Believe it or not, the stuttering beat on "In Your Dreams" with Big Boi and Killer Mike rapping and Janelle Monae and Sleepy Brown providing the hook actually comes off rather polished. "Greatest Show On Earth" by Macy Gray is a little trippy to say the least. Equally trippy is "Mutron Angel" but the singing as well as the point to the song make up for the spaced out track. "PJ & Rooster" is a song straight from the movie, while "When I Look In Your Eyes" showcases the piano-heavy style of the Roaring 20s. Andre does more singing than anything on this album, with numbers such as "Dyin' To Live," "Life Is Like A Musical," and the bouncy "Idlewild Blues." Sleepy Brown and Scar show up on three tracks together, including the aforementioned "Morris Brown," the melodic "Peaches," and "The Train" (all featuring Big Boi doing the rapping). Snoop Dogg and Lil Wayne make a huge impression on "Hollywood Divorce" while Janelle Monae makes up for her amateurish work on Got Purp? Vol. 2 with her impressive period singing on "Call The Law."The album is also sprinkled with skits and short tracks to keep the flow continuous between tracks. If you thought the duo had done every possible thing with their previous work, you will certainly be shocked with the final cut of Idlewild....the "soundtrack" as well as the movie.

There has been a bunch of news emanating from Houston in recent weeks. You got Destiny's Child getting ready to dismantle, then the city was one of many major destinations for the Hurricane Katrina evacuees, and most recently was the four-game sweep by the Chicago White Sox over the Houston Astros in the World Series. With all this disappointing stuff happening to the city, Houston needed a little boost to lift its spirits...at least for a little while. Enter local deejay and rapper Paul Wall to fill their hearts with joy and their ears with delight from yet another impressive album from the Dirty Dirty. Paul Wall has been on the underground rap scene for some time now, releasing albums with his partner-in-crime Chamillionaire and popping up on other rappers' albums as well. After the success of "Still Tippin" with Mike Jones, it was the perfect opportunity for Paul Wall to drop The People's Champ and benefit from the sudden popularity of Dirty South rappers.The breakout single "Sittin' Sideways" is one of the many good tracks from the major record release from Swishahouse/Asylum/Atlantic. Bun B makes two guest appearances with Paul Wall's second single "They Don't Know" and the song "Trill," which is the same title as Bun B's first solo album (see review below). Paul Wall includes his collaboration with Kanye West called "Drive Slow" that was originally featured on Kanye's Late Registration album. Trey Songz makes his 700th cameo with the song "Ridin' Dirty" and Freeway integrates some East Coast flavor on "State To State." "Big Ballin" and "I'm A Playa" featuring Three Six Mafia is done with elements of that 'screwed' sound that accompanies a lot of albums coming from the sound that derived from the late Dj Screw. "So Many Diamonds" featuring T.I. discusses the ever-growing trend of diamond-encrusted fronts that a lot of rappers have continued to rock in their grills.But The People's Champ isn't entirely plastered with cameos, as Paul Wall does his thing on the solo tip as well. The highly-arrogant "Smooth Operator" gives you a sense of Paul Wall's ego while "Internet Goin' Nutz" depicts him as some charismatic geek surfing online chat rooms for some computer love. "Girl" samples the Chi-Lites' "Oh Girl" for a melody that the ladies can enjoy. "Just Paul Wall" is another mellow cut that seems to showcase the sentimental side for the ladies so that they know there is more to the rapper than what you see on TV. "Sippin The Barre" possesses that signature southern sound that we all have gotten conditioned to even though the background beat reminds me of Ray J's horrible "Centerview" song from his latest album Raydiation.It doesn't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing, and Paul Wall has been received very well by the music industry and the listening public as well. The People's Champ debuted number one on the Billboard 200 charts, and nothing is stopping Paul Wall from continuing his trek to the top. And even though he's a white rapper, it practically has no bearing on his ability to appeal to the masses or the Hip-Hop community. The People's Champ is something that Paul Wall as well as the city of Houston can be proud of.

Introducing the next failed attempt by a predominantly Hip-Hop label to put out an album by an R&B; artist. This might be a little harsh, but if you look of the track record of anybody that does this, you will see that this hardly ever works. Sure, Ashanti worked for a minute for Murder Inc, but does anybody actually own Concrete Rose? Anybody remember the Def Jam offshoot named Def Soul? Sure, it had Kelly Price, Dru Hill, and Case, but where are these artists now? And let's talk about Rocafella itself. How many years has Rell been on that roster without an album? And Allen Anthony should've known he wasn't ever going to come out with an album considering the bad showing Rocafella had with his old group Christion. Teairra Mari might want to be an exception to the rule, but she doesn't have the special quality that some pioneers have when it comes to marrying contemporary R&B; and Hip-Hop music.Sure, her break out single "Make Her Feel Good" made for great spins on the radio. Songs like "Act Right" and "New Sh*t" have decent beats and songwriting, and the song "LaLa" has exquisite production that rivals any other track out there right now. You can even enjoy "M.V.P." despite the pointless high notes during the chorus. But then, that's pretty much all the good points of the album. "Phone Booth" sounds a bit immature and unrefined, and "Get Up On Ya Gangsta" is nothing special in comparison to her better songs. "Get Down Tonight" reminds you of L'Trimm's "Cars With The Boom" when it first starts off and the rest of the song leaves you with little to keep your attention. And the second single "No Daddy" as well as the remix version are practically as annoying and ridiculous as Brooke Valentine's "Girlfight."Brooke....i mean Ashanti....i mean Ciara....i mean Teairra Mari has a lot of work ahead of her if she thinks this will be a breakout album for her. Once she becomes an adult, she will be able to expand her content and sing about more experiences she's had up to that time. And maybe Jigga will have a handle on what it takes to promote an R&B; artist in the industry already bubbling over with similar acts. It's more than a notion to try to expand on the groundwork set by the likes of Mary J, Faith, and 112. Hopefully by then, the music business as a whole will come to embrace this rising breed of urban music.

It's been nearly four years since we last heard from Heather Headley. After the Trinidad native scored a Tony Award in 1998 for her role in Aida and releasing her debut album This Is Who I Am on RCA Records in 2002, the songstress has finally returned to bless the music world with another album. For Headley, this is a true test to see if she was just lucky or if she has what it takes to make it in today's R&B; market. In My Mind continues where her first album left off, giving us more of what we've been waiting for...real soul music.She starts off with the first single "In My Mind," a song that rivals many R&B; ballads the past couple years, as well as similar country songs as of late. "Am I Worth It" begs the question that most women want to ask the men in their lives. "Wait A Minute" is about not playing games with a man not doing what he's supposed to do in a relationship. "I Didn't Mean To" continues the whole notion of a man making excuses about messing up, summing up his actions as things he didn't mean to do. "How Many Ways" gives us a different sound than we're accustom to hearing from Heather, instead using an island-like rhythm and much faster lyrics from the singer. "Back When It Was" flashes back to the 1950s with Heather reminiscing about a past relationship over a doo-wop beat. "What's Not Being Said" discusses a no-good mate that's now left without giving a good reason for doing so."Losing You" deals with the happiness expressed after getting the no good man out of your life. Another island-based track called "Rain" featuring reggae artist Shaggy talks about how good love feels to a woman. "Letter" is a song about how Heather has to write a goodbye note instead of saying it in person because she can't stand to even see the no good man again. "Me Time" is pretty self-explanatory, while "Change" sounds like a song more suited for a sappy girl flick or something.So listening to this album will leave you wanting to tell off your significant other, writing them a nasty note, and rejoicing in their departure from your life! ~LOL~ Seriously though, Heather does switch it up throughout the album, showing how you can be showered with love and have someone in your life that can alter it in a good way too. Although there may be one too many "no good man" songs, a lot of people out there can relate to the messages in those songs. In My Mind is definitely filled with emotion...something Heather Headley has mastered on Broadway and in music.

Goapele is a phenomenal artist in every sense of the word. She paints vivid pictures of the stories she tells, a craft that few singers can truly do since they all tend to resort to whatever catchy hook is going to get them a Top 40 hit. The socially-conscious vibe as well as the wistful antidotes shape the very essence of who Goapele is and what her music is about. Even Closer (the revamped version of her independently released Closer) was released in 2002 and helped get her name out there to the contemporary soul crowd. Now over three years later, the sultry songstress returns with her second album Change It All. Luckily, she sticks to a similar formula on this album and doesn't adjust her sound too much.The title track "Change It All" is the most melodic piece on the whole album, resorting mostly on a simple piano riff and Goapele's deep thoughts on the problems of the world and of your neighborhood. "First Love" takes a look back at the magical feelings we all felt with our initial relationships. "Different" talks about the how couples that start out okay can result in both sides drifting apart and hoping things can be worked out. "Crushed Out" talks about the warm feeling you get from being with your significant other. "Find A Way" is a mid-tempo cut about how we all need to start acting right and doing things for the greater good. "If We Knew" reflects on things we've learned about that we should have handled differently. "Battle Of My Heart" is a soft serenade about following your feelings without giving much thought to what the true consequences of your actions will be. "Darker Side Of The Moon" is a spirited anthem penned by longtime songwriter/producer Linda Perry.There are a few experimental tracks like "Love Me Right" "4AM" and "Fly Away." But considering this is her second album, she has a little wiggle room to try some things without losing the listeners' interest. With a solid sophomore effort, Goapele has the material to capture new fans of her music. I've had the chance to see her perform live twice and both times she was phenomenal. If you get a chance to hear Change It All (see the Media Center to hear the entire album now) or catch her as an opening act, you will see that Goapele is a truly blessed singer. Hopefully you'll be as blessed as I am for hearing her music in the first place.

Jamie Foxx is certainly a well-rounded individual to say the least. After his time with the cast of In Living Color and landing his own Jamie Foxx Show, he was starting off very well. Making moves in movies would be his next calling, showcasing his talents in movies like Any Given Sunday as Willie Beaman or his silliness in Booty Call. But his later movies such as Collateral and Ray would prove to everyone that he indeed was an actor to be taken seriously. You don't see Will Smith with any Oscars, do you? And his stand-up has always remained relevant throughout his entire career, but luckily it was just a background job and not his main source of income. Now Jamie takes his stab at singing again after a dismal showing with his first solo album Peep This back in 1994. And even though the new album is named Unpredictable, Jamie's voice is anything but erratic."Unpredictable" is a good break out song for Jamie. It showcases his singing abilities and it pairs him with Ludacris, one of the biggest names in mainstream music right now. He continues his collaborations when he joins back up with Twista for "DJ Play A Love Song" "With You" featuring Snoop Dogg and The Game, and "Extravaganza" featuring Kanye West. His best collabo has to be the remake of "Love Changes" with the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul Mary J. Blige. But Jamie really shines when it's just him and the microphone (just like his album cover!) "Can I Take U Home" will make you flash back to the good ole Jodeci days with the sound much like material from the group's last album The Show, The After Party, The Hotel. The slammin' cuts "Do What It Do" and "V.I.P." both were composed with the help of the missing-in-action crooner Tank. "Get This Money" offers a nice change of pace, while "Storm" and "Three Letter Word" are probably the most provocative tracks on the cd.He closes the album with two tender ballads that are obviously dear to his heart, namely "Heaven" and "Wish U Were Here." The latter song is probably going to be a heavily-played song by those mourning their own losses in their lives. Unpredictable essentially lives up to its name, as nobody could have expected such a stellar album from Jamie Foxx. I predict we will be hearing a whole lot more music from him in the future.

I've been listening to Conya Doss for some time now. She exploded on the underground music scene back in 2002 with A Poem About Ms. Doss and later followed that album up with an equally impressive sophomore disc titled Just Because in 2004. You would think after two magnificent albums that the labels would come knocking down her door to sign her. But this special needs teacher from Cleveland settled for sold out nightclubs and a modest following instead. Fans of her work pondered if they would be delighted with another soulful helping from the songstress. Luckily for us, Conya Doss isn't through with music quite yet. Her latest album Love Rain Down is just as strong as her previous two offerings."Tell Me Why" questions the motives behind hurting a lover's heart. "Find A Way" tells about the long-standing adage that there's brighter days beyond any storms that you encounter throughout your life. "Call Me" is a more up-tempo song that just has a fun vibe to enjoy. "Let You Know" reverts back to a more familiar sound with drawn out notes and soft-spoken words. "Only Be Me" is an inspirational song on being truthful about who you are and appreciating the gift of being a unique individual. "Sign" is an acoustic melody that is grounded with simplicity yet soars with emotion."Those Wur The Dayz" reflects back on the good times of yesteryear. "Love Rain Down" is a mid-tempo, free-flowing tune about embracing love. "The One" is a mellow cut on knowing that certain someone is the right person for you. She continues that same sentiment on "Beautiful Thing" when she explains that love conquers all. "Nevermind" is a tale about moving on from a relationship that wasn't going anywhere fast. "Why Did You?" is a Caribbean-flavored tune about somebody getting caught up in their own web of deceit. The album closes with the self-explanatory song "Get On My Nerves."Love Rain Down is more of the same from Conya Doss. Luckily for her (and for us)...that's a good thing.

Bun B has been in the rap game since the 1980s and has no signs of stopping any time soon. From his early work with Pimp C to the pinnacle of his career with the guest appearance on Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin" off Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter in 1999, Bun B has seen the best and worst of times over the years. His label woes, the incarceration of Pimp C, and his fight to stay relevant in a ever-changing Rap arena are all examples of the things that could make or break a rap career. Politics, interruptions, and significance are the major factors that ultimately decide how far any rapper will go in the music business. Bun B has that drive that every artist should have if they want to seriously make a living off this rap game. He 'knuckled up' and focused on cleaning up his act, getting right with the record execs, and popping up on songs on the albums of anybody willing to trade verses with a certifiable legend. He kept his eye on the prize, and for Bun B, that was simply doing what it took to keep the UGK name out there while Pimp C remained in jail. He continues his push with the solo release of Trill, a culmination that everybody always wanted but ultimately only surfaced because of necessity.Trill starts off with an introduction by Rap-A-Lot's J. Prince and Bun B highlighting things like the whole New Orleans fiasco, the 'Free Pimp C' movement, and his aspirations of being the unofficial president of the South. Right after that, he rips out a verbal assassination on "Bun," and resurrects Jay-Z from "retirement" to join him as well as Young Jeezy and Z-Ro on the song "Get Throwed." The first single "Draped Up" showcases some conventional UGK-sounding grooves, along with "What I Represent" and "Retaliation Is A Must." Anyone looking for an autobiography of Bun B can hear it on the song "The Story" where he details the good, the bad, and the ugly. But Bun B ventures beyond his comfort zone and does a few songs that are not typical UGK songs. "I'm Ballin" featuring Jazze Pha is more radio-friendly than most anything UGK has ever done. Scarface collaborates with Bun and Young Jeezy on "Pushin," an attempt to appeal to the pimps, players, and the hustlers still reppin' for the streets.Tracks like "Git It" with the Ying Yang Twins and the slow R&B-tinged; "Hold U Down" with Trey Songz, Mike Jones, and Baby leave loyal fans raising their eyebrows while the bandwagon crowd will embrace it without thinking twice about it. "Who Need A B" is injected with Juvenile and Too Short's vocals along with Short Dog's production that has remained the same since Born To Mack. It's almost a given that Ludacris offers a unexciting appearance on "Trill Recognize Trill." And the weird "Late Night Creepin" features a peculiar participation from Skinhead Rob and Travis Barker of the punk rock group The Transplants. Trill is nevertheless a decent album considering Bun B had to pretty much go at it alone. But with the possible release of Pimp C from confinement by year's end, Bun will be able to put UGK back on the front burner.

Alicia Keys has truly done it all in the music world. After being signed to other labels before ultimately being blessed with Clive Davis and J Records, she has sold millions of records, won awards and accolades galore, been on countless magazine covers, admired the world over by fans and those looking for a good role model, and solidified a lasting musical career for years to come. She is compared to legends that have paved the way for her to be where she is, including Aretha Franklin, Prince, and the late Donny Hathaway. Being of mixed race, she is embraced by both Blacks and Whites as well as other people who love her for her music, her beauty, and her style. So it was basically a no-brainer that a live album from this classically-trained pianist-turned-R&B; superstar would be stellar in every way imaginable. Well, some might be surprised with the inequities that are widespread on this Unplugged album.I have to stop now and say that I am a fan of Alicia Keys through and through. I've seen her perform live twice now: once at the beginning of her climb to stardom when Fallin' was all you would hear from practically every urban station in America, and another time when she had proven herself as a superstar and sold millions of copies of Songs In A Minor to all her newly attained fans. I own both her studio albums, and continue to support everything she does. (Getting ready to drop a bomb now) But Unplugged is far from the tree when it comes to comparing it to her multi-platinum gems. Don't get me wrong, she does a pretty good job throughout the entire recorded performance. But that's like a CEO giving an speech to his employees, saying all the right things but still stumbling over his or her words. Sure, it was a "pretty good job" but it's certainly nowhere near the best that they can do. So is the case with Alicia Keys and her Unplugged album.Performing new school classics like "A Woman's Worth," "Fallin," and "You Don't Know My Name" are passable, sometimes hitting the wrong note, not catching her breath, and overstretching her voice at times. And the background singers should've been screened or something because they sound like somebody you'd find at your local talent show held at bar trying to pass itself as a club (we've all been to one of those!) Even her newest song "Unbreakable" sounds a little rushed when you listen to it. And her song with Adam Levine entitled "Wild Horses" is way out of left field. It sounds like a deep topic, but you would never know it. With Levine's overbearing twang, and Alicia's missteps at trying to gel with Levine's flow on the song, your left wondering why they even did the song in the first place.I know you probably are sitting there in astonishment...believe me, I was doing the same thing. I literally had to listen to this album over and over again to make sure I was losing it. But alas, it is all there for your ears to hear in disbelief. I was trying to think of reasons why the singing was off that night, and all I could come up with was the possibility of too much rehearsing. It helps that the majority of Unplugged is full of decently performed songs that we have come to love and enjoy. But there were easily a lot of keys missed that day by Alicia. After hearing the musical massacre on a bunch of these songs, you might actually wish you had left your cd player Unplugged! (let the hate mail begin!)

Dat N!gg@ Daz is who he is and staying in the game has been his focus for years. Starting off early on countless Death Row projects and even dabbling behind the boards is how he got into the business. But it wasn't until the monstrous Dogg Food album by Tha Dogg Pound that he got worldwide attention. Not one to settle on just the group thing with Kurupt, Daz broke out on his own with Retaliation, Revenge & Get Back. But when that album went nowhere, so did his career. After multiple independent albums and a reunion with Kurupt and Snoop for the recent Cali Iz Active album, Daz tries his hand again at the solo thang with So So Gangsta.Now even though Jermaine Dupri is at the helm of this project, So So Gangsta reps the West through and through. "DPG Fo' Life" features the vocal stylings of Soopafly and Snoop, while Kurupt makes an appearance on the thumpin' "Money On My Mind." Cube even shows up for the West Coast throwback feel of "Strizap." An instant club cut is "Weekend" with fellow So So Def artist Johnta Austin. But most fans remember the hard side of Daz, and that side of him pops up on the malicious "Rat A Tat Tat" and "Dangerous" featuring The Kid Slim.Unfortunately, there are some potholes along the way that bring the album down. The Rick Ross supported "On Some Real" sound like they really were on something considering how wack the final product turned out. "The One" featuring Jagged Edge is insignificant and unnecessary. Daz doesn't sound like he even tried on the song "All I Need," "Dat's Dat N!gg@" isn't well-produced, and "Badder Than A Mutha" featuring Avery Storm is a futile attempt at a radio-friendly joint.With half of the songs being stellar and the other half a complete waste of space, So So Gangsta doesn't have the appeal it will need to get record-breaking sales from long-time fans. But at least Daz gives us a decent enough album to help with the resurrection of the West Coast. Next Up will be The Game's sophomore effort entitled The Doctor's Advocate! Until then, Cali Iz Active and So So Gangsta will have to do.

This feline is back, and she is ready to capture the attention of those who doubted her return. Jaguar Wright is probably best known for her background vocals on Jay-Z's MTV Unplugged album but she also put out an album entitled Denials, Delusions, and Decisions back in 2002. But with a pending pregnancy (which she happily showcased in her video for the song "What If"), this gritty songstress found herself being looked over and under-promoted by her then label MCA Records. Now having suffered a shelved album entitled And Your Point Is in 2003, Jaguar resurfaces on Artemis Records with the aptly titled Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul.The title is fitting considering Jaguar eagerly breaks the mold of just sounding "new" and different from everything else that is out. You can practically say that she is at times possessed with the sound of old school soul we all grew up with. "Woman To Woman" is a modern twist to Shirley Brown's classic song on dealing with an outsider trying to creep in on her territory...namely her man. But besides remaking a classic, Jaguar dives into a near 12-minute escapade on "Do Your Worst", reminiscent of those 12" singles that some of us might remember from the days of old.She, like many other artists, gives a vocal tribute to her seed on the song "Flower." Those of you that loved her debut album will appreciate songs like "My Place," "Let Me Be The One," and "One More Drink" (the latter being a spillover track from her unreleased album mentioned earlier.) Her hip-hop influence is demonstrated on the track "Timing," where she uses the same beat from Clipse's "Grindin," and "Been Here Before" provides some of here potty-mouth antics that we became accustom to on Denials, Delusions, and Decisions. Even the first single "Free" is refreshing in that Jaguar isn't scared tell it like it is. One thing is for sure, Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul is proof that Jaguar's ready to move on to bigger and better things.

Supposedly, Black Rob is in the middle of a court battle that could land him in jail for a long time. It seems to be a curse over there at Bad Boy and it's artists. One of three things happen to you: You either land in jail (Mysonne, Shyne, etc), get dropped or leave right when your career is taking off (Craig Mack, Mase, The Lox), or depart the earth way too soon (R.I.P. Biggie). This Bad Boy alum returns with the album The Black Rob Report, a continuation of sorts of 2000's Life Story. And anybody that heard the first album knows that a continuation of that album is not a good thing!Don't get me wrong, there are a few songs that are tolerable. "Watch Your Movements" featuring Akon (yes, Akon is actually listenable on here) is a song that works for Black Rob considering his admiration for the street life. "B.L.A.C.K." is a decent track with Black Rob telling a story about hustling on the streets and doing what he has to do to get by. "Team" features a few bars from newcomers Ness, Chopper, and Babs from Bad Boy's Da Band. Ness returns and does his thing on "Fire In The Hole" as well. The rest of the album is basically average or worse.The beat on "They Heard I Got Life" is too loud and sounds a bit forced. The same can be said about "Smile In Ya Face," along with Black Rob's poor decision to reword a bunch of lyrics from people like KRS, Biggie, and Slick Rick. "Help Me Out" will have you frown up from what sounds like a Vaudeville sample! "When You Come Home" featuring Rhea is passable although it uses a beat straight from 1983 or something. "Star In The Hood" exclaims who Black Rob truly is, showing little to prove that he's worthy of being a global icon like 50 Cent or Kanye West. Other wack joints include "She's A Pro" featuring Mr. Porter and "Y'all Know Who Killed Him" featuring (a sample of) Notorious B.I.G. "Warrior" featuring Cali Ranks and "Long Live B.R." are not bad songs, but it's certainly not his best either.The Black Rob Report is more of the same from yet another mediocre Bad Boy artist. Puffy hasn't had much luck finding a standout rapper to shine like his boy Biggie did for his label. And as far as Black Rob goes, he may or may not be sent to up the river from his pending court battle. But even if he beats his case, his non-existent rap career is like a lot of those prisoners in there for life...walking dead.

After breaking on the scene back in the mid-90s with R&B group Mista and then re-materializing in 2001 with his debut solo joint, Bobby Valentino is setting out to prove to the world that he could potentially be a long-standing and respected R&B recording artist. And when you listen to Special Occasion, it's becomes apparent that Bobby V has the talent to make good on his promise. "Anonymous" is his current smash hit flying up the charts because of it's energy and catchiness. He stays the course with the equally admirable "Checkin' For Me." Ludacris helps out his DTP fam for the ghetto harmony of "Rearview (Ridin')," followed by the enjoyable tracks "If I Had My Way" and "How 'Bout It" where he focuses on crooning the ladies even more. "Turn The Page" is all right, but it certainly shouldn't have been the lead-off single. "Home Is Where You Belong" is outstanding and has all the qualities for being a radio release. Fabolous drops a verse for yet another radio-ready single titled "Let Him Go." "Only Human" and "Can't Wait 'Til Later"are probably the most familiar sounding cuts with similar production and songwriting from previous work with Mista as well as his debut album. "I Was Wrong" is a throwback to the simpler days of R&B where great songwriting and vocals were more important than anything else. Bobby V does a knockout job of covering Babyface's classic "Soon As I Get Home." He closes the album with "Over & Over," a song that fans of 90's R&B will like the most since it puts you in the mind of Jodeci. Special Occasion is an album that every true soul music fanatic should add to their collection. Bobby Valentino will sure shut the naysayers down with this unforgettable album.

Okay, this isn't your everyday compilation by any means. A lot of times there are jazz collections put together that simply don't incorporate enough big names to persuade the casual contemporary jazz fan to want to take a chance on it. You might see one or two names you are familiar with, but after that, you're stuck with only so-so production from average singers doing only okay songs. And a lot of times you get albums that have R&B-tinged; songs, but not one R&B; singer in sight on the disc. I'm a huge fan of jazz covers of R&B; songs, but I really love it when R&B; singers jump out of the box and actually try their hand at singing a little jazz. Well the architect behind the creation of the Cafe Soul All Stars were paying attention and have blessed us with Love Pages.Of course you get your dose of contemporary jazz here with George Benson handling vocals and guitar on "Pages" and Bobby Lyle on the up-tempo instrumental "Brazilian Heat." The lounge vibe comes across on Jon Lucien's "To Be With You," a song that some will compare to the work of the late great Lou Rawls. Musical mastermind Roy Ayers and Kenny Garrett command your attention on the upbeat dance groove "Urban Jungle." Ayers pops back up again with a smoother track called "Pier 69" that accentuates his percussion perfection.One of the best features on Love Pages is the inclusion of some known R&B; and Jazz singers who know how to breathe life into a song. Maysa does double duty with the silky sounds of "Stay In My Heart" and the resonant "I'm Changing," a track that is radio friendly enough for today's Smooth Jazz stations. Glenn Jones belts out another contender for the airwaves with "What You Gonna Do" while Peabo Bryson validates his power ballad expertise on "Don't Make Me Cry." The incognito Christopher Williams resurfaces with a nice tune called "Used To Be" while equally missing-in-action songstress Vesta makes her presence known with "One More Bridge To Cross"Other lesser known talents like Denise Stewart ("U and I"), Jazmyn ("You Don't Have To Say You're Sorry") and Ida Onyanango ("Sheba") round out this collection beautifully. It's no surprise that one of the geniuses behind this disc is Norman Connors, a man who's instincts make him unparalleled to say the least. Love Pages takes you on a musical journey where the terrain is always changing, but the ride stays smooth the whole way through.

Any fan of Christion from the past knows that they had a very unique sound to begin with. This was probably the main reason why Roc-a-fella had a hard time promoting this R&B; group back then (I've already gave my two cents about rap labels failing when it comes to promoting R&B; artists). But I can honestly say that even though I loved "Full of Smoke" from their first album, I didn't buy the album until years later because of the simple fact that I never heard anything else from that album to give up my $10. Fast forward to 2005, and things have truly changed for the group. No longer having Allen Anthony for the lead vocals, Christion consists of the other original member Kenny Ski as well as T. Ross, the background vocalist from the first Christion album. So that would lead you to believe that since the fill-in member was around for Ghetto Cyrano that this album would be just as good. Think again!Project Plato suffers from a lot of things, but the biggest problem is singing ability. One listen to practically ANY song will leave you in complete astonishment...and not in a good way either. The main theme throughout the album seems to be some sort of "hustler" mentality, something that has grown in popularity over the years. But the songs come off like a visit to a bad karaoke night. Singing on songs like "No Place," "Farrah," and "Crazy Close" remind me of the foolery that Timex Social Club had. "My Reason" will have you laughing out loud after only hearing the chorus alone! The lyrics on "Supermodel" sound like a third grade student wrote them. Christion's singing on "Presidential Suite" does a horrible job of convincing anybody (let alone any woman) of their macking abilities. Allen Anthony does lend a helping hand on the songs "Slow Motion" and "Grandma's Grove," two obvious standout songs in comparison to the rest of the album.But there are so many unquestionably bad songs that very little of this album could even be considered listenable. Do yourself a favor and buy Project Plato in the cut-out bin 10 years from now. After paying $1 or $2 for the album, you're sure to get your money's worth with all of laughing you'll do from hearing all of the ridiculousness on this album. Hopefully you aren't reading this review after purchasing the album already. If you are, there's always the resale shop!

Smooth....Thought-Provoking.....Charismatic...Words you wouldn't typically associate with an ex-con, right? Well, Lyfe Jennings is all the above and proves it with his debut album 268-192. Most people who have done hard time try not to let that be purposely known to the public. But Lyfe isn't scared to let the world know all about his past, bringing it full force his album of grimy memoirs and perspectives on life and relationships. Lyfe starts out on his lyrical journey with the debut single "Must Be Nice," his personal insight on having somebody to stand by your side through thick and thin. From the the baby mommas sitting on their butts collecting welfare and child support on "Greedy" to the the two-faced "church-going" individuals on "Made Up My Mind," Lyfe gives you his thoughts on a lot of topics and doesn't hesitate for a moment to tell it like it is. He pours his heart out on the song "Cry," telling the world that men have just as many problems and emotional roller coasters as women. His gripes on church continue on "Stick-Up Kid" when he exclaims that church has turned into a fashion show of sorts. But "Stick Up Kid" really tells the harsh reality of growing up in the streets and doing what you have to do to survive each day. Even "She Got Kids" gives off the realistic thought process most guys go through when deciding whether they should even consider dating a lady with children. But there are light-hearted songs on the album like "My Life," "Smile," and "The Way I Feel About You" that shows that despite his past he can still look at life as meaningful and worthwhile. 268-192 is a display of how far Lyfe has come...and it seems he is trying live up to his moniker wholeheartedly now.

Lyfe Jennings has got to be pinching himself right now because he's literally on top of the world. Girls are screaming at his jam-packed concerts, the brothers are showing him love for keeping it real, and his label has to be satisfied with their decision to take a chance on Lyfe and his music. After doing a bid and pouring his heart out for his monstrous debut Lyfe 268-192, the soul survivor gives his next chapter with his latest release The Phoenix.The biggest difference between his first cd and The Phoenix has to be the fact that the interludes are separate tracks instead of slapping them at the end of each song. This is great for people who make their own mixes and don't want to struggle with an odd transition in their personal mix cds. All technicalities aside, The Phoenix starts off with the so-so track "Slow Down" with Young Buck. He then explodes into "Goodbye," a monster ballad that is arguably his most heartfelt song to date. "Let's Stay Together" is a good 'I'm sorry' song for those instant requests hours on late night radio when you want to smooth things over. "Biggie N!gga" is probably his most comical just from the title alone, while "Ghetto Superman" describes how Lyfe feels about being looked up to by everybody around him. His first single "S.E.X." is a song that all these growing ladies out here need to hear. "Down Here, Up There" is a simple acoustic song about dealing with the struggles on Earth to keep from going up to Heaven before your time.The old school feel of the music on "The River" helps with conveying Lyfe's message of giving your life over to God. "Still Here" is another okay track, with help from Three Six Mafia and Project Pat. "More Than A Girl" tells about the importance of a woman in general, while "Stingy" is Lyfe's song about having a close bond with the one you love. "Radio" just talks about the power of hearing your favorite songs on the radio and putting aside the troubles of your life. His interesting take of 2pac's "Keep Ya Head Up" is not your everyday cover considering he harmonizes the verses and incorporates a group of kids for part of the song.He closes out the album with a bonus track called "I'll Always Love You" that is worthy of being a radio single in the future.Even though it's not as strong as his first album, The Phoenix proves that Lyfe Jennings has the skills to be a long-lasting artist in this business. There's no sophomore jinx here, that's for sure.

Ideally, this should be a short review. The reason is simple....nobody should have to stomach listening to an entire Cam'ron album that's this lethargic. From the beginning, I knew this wasn't something I was going to enjoy. The straight singing on "He Tried To Play Me" is absolutely idiotic to say the least. "Leave Me Alone" has a sample that is just intolerable to the point that I practically nosedived for the skip button. The same thing occurs on the hook for "Living A Lie," leaving me in a weird space of mass confusion. After shaking it off, I press the Play button only to be berated with even more disappointment. This time it's the lyrics coming out of Cam'ron's mouth that sound like a eighth grader wrote them on "We Make Change." After a redundant voicemail interlude, we are force fed a song called "Wet Wipes." Wet Wipes? WTF? "Touch It Or Not" with Lil Wayne resorts to more of the same "Rocky"-like horn-playing cascading behind more weak lyrics from Cam. You won't even make it to Lil Wayne's verse before begging for the end of the song. Is that enough, or should I continue?Most of you probably have stopped reading. Good for you! For the rest of you, let's continue the execution of your eardrums. "War" has a bunch of pointless lyrics that go nowhere, so basically it's nothing more than the signature Cam'ron sound. He continues this on "Triple Up" and "I.B.S." (yep... that's Irritable Bowel Syndrome for those who aren't medically educated). "Get Ya Gun" starts with a PSA about gun control, then Cam'ron goes into a unintelligible rap about shooting them thangs. "White Girls" is not like the BET Uncut classic by Mighty Casey, but rather a metaphor for the illegal substance of the same color.Still with me? I hope not. If you are, we move on to "Girls, Cash, Cars," a musical seizure waiting to happen with the music and the lyrics floating all over the place. The Earth, Wind, and Fire sample of "That's The Way Of The World" on "Do Ya Thing" (Remix) is ineffective. "Get Em Daddy" (Remix) is a collection of the DipSet posse showcasing their usual 16 bars of nothingness. After another voicemail interlude, Cam'ron trades more brainless verses with Hell Rell on "Something New." The only okay track is Cam'ron's lyrical attack on Jay-Z on "You Gotta Love It," a song that Jigga probably isn't too worried about having any real impact on his rep. And finally, the song "Love My Life" with Nicole Wray is what I've been waiting the entire time to hear. What's so special about this song, you ask? It's the last track on the album. Now back to your regularly-scheduled hip-hop programming. Hopefully it doesn't include anything from Killa Season.

It's good to see these two ladies back for another album. After blasting on the R&B; scene a few years back, Marsha Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart were immediately embraced by all lovers of real soul music. It was their first album Floetic that produced hits like the title track "Floetic" and the seductive "Say Yes." They put out a live album entitled Floacism that fed the appetites of all the newly-acquired fans anticipating more from the dynamic duo. Just over three years from their slammin' first album comes Flo'Ology, a journey that goes deeper into the minds and souls of Floetry.Don't be alarmed when I say that Flo'Ology sounds pretty consistent with how the first album was. For some people, that might spell a sign of mediocrity, but this is far from the truth. No one can deny the unique vibe that these two give off with their poetry and lyrics while infusing elements of jazz, blues, and rap as well. "Supastar" with Common continues their ongoing love for hip-hop in their music. "Closer" and "Lay Down" both follow in the same vein as "Say Yes" with their suggestive nature and rhythmical flows. And even though "My Apology" sounds more refined and possesses more thought in its delivery, it still reminds me of Floetic's "Hey You." "Feelings" is a jazzy-type track that is totally stripped down to the bare essentials with light piano playing and a few string instruments. This carries on in the song "Sometimes U Make Me Smile" but emphasizes the poetic side more than on "Feelings." "Imagination" gets a little assist with the writing expertise of Raphael Saadiq, and "Let Me In" is a smooth ballad that could easily be their next radio-friendly cut.There are a few okay songs like "Blessed 2 Have," "I'll Die," and "I Want U." But Floetry is undoubtedly the only good example of how the combination of poetry and music can go well beyond a open mic session at the local jazz club. Flo'Ology is a very good album that any fan of their music will love and most R&B; lovers will no doubt find to be worthy of their attention.

Soulife is so previously unreleased material Anthony Hamilton did for a label named Soulife Records. Anthony went back into the studio to polish up some of the tracks to sound more up-to-date and relevant to today considering they are originally produced in the 1990s. Soulife is just above mediocre, serving as mostly as a snapshot at the early beginnings of a struggling R&B; artist in Anthony Hamilton.Songs like "Last Night" featuring Sunshine Anderson and "Love and War" featuring Macy Gray give an intriguing look at two artists who, at the beginning of their careers, desired to be more than just wannabe singers. But unlike Anthony Hamilton, both suffered from lackluster sales and mundane lyrics most of the time. "Georgie Parker" and "Icing On The Cake" are just okay tracks that still sound very dated. And "I Cry" sounds like a throwback to the 1950s with the somber, drawn out rendition of an old jukebox ballad.But all is not lost with Soulife. "Love Is So Complicated" is one of the better songs, giving you a dose of the realness that Anthony Hamilton has demonstrated on his debut album. This is also evident on the first (and probably only) single "Ball And Chain" as well as the songs "I Used To Love Someone" and "Exclusively." So if you are a true Anthony Hamilton fan, you will still enjoy the majority of songs on this collection. But if not, I'm sure you will have your fill of new Anthony Hamilton material in the years to come.

Lyricist Gift of Gab and DJ/Producer Chief Xcel are back on the scene once again, trying to please their loyal fan base as well as capitalize on the recent success of Andre 3000 and the eclectic music he brought to the mainstream on Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. They have always been labeled as an "alternative" rap group, choosing to go against the norm when it came to their rhyme flows, musical selections, and subject matter. With two early EPs from the 1990s and the later full-length releases of the critically-acclaimed Nia and the lackluster yet heavily heavily hyped Blazing Arrow, Blackalicious are not out to prove anything to anybody. Rather, they remain true to their ability for gathering new sounds and techniques to express their thoughts and feelings. Thus the release of The Craft, an album full of unique and authentic material that a lot of people are looking for in music today.Although a lot of Rock-Rap fans would gravitate towards material put out by Blackalicious, it can still be enjoyed by those hip-hop fans who like the eccentric stuff from artists like Deltron 3030 (led by Del The Funkee Homosapien) and Kool Keith. "Powers" is probably the best example of this, sounding very guitar-heavy and reminiscent of the edgier stuff that Lenny Kravitz tends to put out every now and then. The first single "Your Move" is a perfect illustration of the continuous flow that fans have become accustomed to from Gift of Gab. The Craft's opening track "World of Vibrations" puts you in the mind of Outkast again, but Blackalicious are more serious about their approach and their lyrics than the humorous angle exhibited by Andre 3000. Your head is guaranteed to nod to tunes like "Supreme People" and "Rhythm Sticks" with their heavy riffs, sampled chords, and of course the turntable wizardry of Chief Xcel. "Side by Side" is a comical tale that sounds strikingly similar to something Eminem or D12 would do.Some songs come off a little too weird though, like the abstract "Lotus Flower" and the overly-hyper "Ego Sonic War Drums." But Blackalicious doesn't stray too far out in left field as they still provide their core with some meaningful messages that were heavily present on previous offerings. Songs like "Black Diamonds and Pearls," "Give It To You," and "The Craft" all give some powerful insights for those still wanting the true essence that has shaped the career of Chief Xcel and Gift of Gab. I have nothing but love for Blackalicious for bringing a different element to the rap game, and The Craft is definitely an album for anybody looking for the next level in music in general.

A lot of you probably aren't familiar with this hidden gem. Right around the time when Hip-Hop and R&B; were becoming more intermingled is when Brigette McWilliams released Take Advantage Of Me. Artists like Mary J. Blige, SWV, and Adina Howard were mixing their seductive voices with hip-hop flavor and commanding all the attention from R&B; lovers. A little more publicity and financial backing by Virgin on this project probably would have been the start of a great career for McWilliams. Few even got to chance to hear Take Advantage Of Me, including myself. I didn't hear this album until about a decade later when I was given a copy to listen to. There's no reason why this couldn't have been pushed by her label.From the opening sequence, you know exactly the groove Brigette was going for. "Cherish This Love" has a heavy dose of hip-hop edge, "Baby Don't Play Me" is a soulful rhythm with a similar vibe, and the title track is a heartened plea for someone to do just what she's asking. "No Groove Sweating" goes right along those lines but resorting more on a jazzy background though. "Gotta Be Down" is a radio-friendly cut that will remind you of Adina Howard in a heartbeat. "I Get The Job Done" is a brash mid-tempo melody about how she puts it down, "That's On Me" superbly mixes Hip-Hop, R&B;, and Jazz like you've never heard, and "Blankets Of Playboys" is a drawn out tune that could have been left off the album. She closes the cd with the funky track "You Got Somethin' I Want" and the hip-hop laced "(Don't Let Me Catch You) Slippin."Brigette McWilliams is like a lot of R&B; artists that are around today. They can sing, they can get the party going, and they can slow it down when the time is right. And with everybody trying to do the same thing, somebody's going to be left out in the cold. Take Advantage Of Me wasn't taken advantage of at all, and that's truly a shame. Brigette McWilliams would try once again a few years later with Too Much Woman. And even though that album was just as good (if not better than her first), it too didn't see its full potential. If you want to have a cool R&B; album from the early 90s, then this is one of the cds to get.

After way too many years of waiting and anticipating, the dynamic rap duo of Bun B and Pimp C drop a gem with their certifiable comeback double album appropriately titled Underground Kingz. Even the casual fan will enjoy the seemingly endless collection of new hits that won't leave you wishing you hadn't wasted two hours of your life listening to it. There are so many standouts, it's hard to even pick out the cream of the crop without feeling like you left something out. Their track with Outkast titled "Int'l Player's Anthem" is by far the best possible single to lead off with considering the wide spectrum of rhyming styles on one track. Too Short collaborating for "Life Is 2009" brings back so many good memories of early music from Short Dog. The remix of "Like That" thumps just as much as the original on Pimp C's 2006 solo joint Pimpalation. The feel of the title track borrows from their earlier work and reflects on their journey to become Underground Kingz. Slim Thug, Vicious, and Middlefingaz along with UGK re-evaluate the game on a thunderous "Take The Hood Back." Pimp C and Bun B lay it down for all their adversaries on the highly emotional "Quit Hatin' The South" featuring Charlie Wilson and the Geto Boys' own Willie D. They borrow a hook from N.W.A. for "Trill N*ggaz Don't Die," while Scarface resurfaces for the grimy "Still Ridin Dirty." Talib Kweli partners with the duo for the ode "Real Women," a song that features R&B crooner Raheem Devaughn as well as borrows the beat and melody from Devaughn's sleeper hit "Guess Who Loves You More." One of the most creative cuts has to be "Candy" where Bun B describes his ride and the one-of-a-kind paint job it has! Jazze Pha hooks them up with a pimped-out beat for "Tell Me How Ya Feel" Kool G. Rap and Big Daddy Kane hold it down with UGK for the extraordinary "Next Up." There are still other countless songs that hold their weight on this project. But with an occasional sub-par track here and there as well as the pointless bonus tracks, the cd isn't a certifiable classic. But one things for sure, U.G.K. are in it for the long haul...and Underground Kingz proves their worth if nothing else does.

Dru Hill made a huge impact on the musical landscape that shaped the late 90s R&B; sound. Once the new millenium hit however, things started to get a little rough around the edges with Sisqo venturing off to put out two solo albums. And even though he wasn't the only one to do so (Woody released a spiritual album in 2001), Sisqo pretty much sealed the fate for future Dru Hill albums. True, he had a huge debut solo album titled Unleash The Dragon, but his superstar status came crumbling down with silly remarks about him being able to sing any R&B; cat under the table and a lackluster follow-up titled Return of Dragon.And even though most greatest hits collections are truly what they say they are, the inclusion of Sisqo's solo hits should have been left off this collection. Besides that momentary lapse in judgment, Hits has just that....hits that you grew to love over the years from the quartet-turned-quintet with the introduction of Scola in 2002. It's jammed packed full of back to back jams like "Tell Me," "5 Steps," "In My Bed," "Beauty," "Never Make A Promise," "You Are Everything," "We're Not Making Love No More," "How Deep Is Your Love," "These Are The Times," and the remake "The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind)." They even include "I Should Be..." "I Love You," and "No Doubt" from 2002's Dru World Order. Any true fan like myself has all the albums, so there is no real reason to go out and buy this collection. But for those that just want the jams, Hits should easily fit the bill. Now if they could just regroup and come back with another album, we'd all be happy!

Finally, a New Edition collection that gives a nice selection of major hits and dynamic album tracks all on two discs. There have been quite a few single disc compilations over the years, but none as comprehensive as this latest release. We all know the group had plenty of jams as well as a bunch of solo hits that we want to listen to as well. Classic gems from early in their career include "Lost In Love," "Count Me Out," "Mr. Telephone Man," and "Cool It Now." A few album tracks from then sneak on this double disc as well, namely "Earth Angel," "My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet)," "With You All The Way," and "A Little Bit Of Love (Is All It Takes)." The middle years brought a few more group cuts like "If It Isn't Love," "Your Not My Kind Of Girl," "N.E. Heartbreak," and "Crucial" (the 12" version is featured on here). But those middle years also brought about everybody's solo albums too.Bobby's smashes are represented on here with "My Prerogative," "On Our Own," "Don't Be Cruel," "Every Little Step," "Humpin Around," and "Girlfriend." Ralph's solo joints include "Do What I Gotta Do," "Sensitivity," and "Money Can't Buy You Love" from the Mo' Money soundtrack. Johnny Gill is finally given his props after being left off most other N.E. collections. His featured songs are "Rub You The Right Way," "Wrap My Body Tight" and "My My My." Bell Biv Devoe round out the solo cuts with "Poison," "When Will I See You Smile Again," and "B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)." The later years bring all six members of New Edition back together with the release of Home Again. "I'm Still In Love With You" "You Don't Have To Worry," "Hit Me Off," and "One More Day" are the classics from Home Again that are added to this colossal collection.New Edition to this day don't get the respect that they rightly deserve. They set trends, they came with it for years as a group as well as on the solo tip, and they are still going strong to this day. According to Bobby Brown, they are planning a national tour with all six members taking part. Hopefully they will have time in between to record at least one more classic to add to their arsenal. Gold shines bright and will please any New Edition fan in addition to those who just want a massive package of their biggest hits. N.E. Forever!

Ciara is out to prove to the world that she isn't a overnight sensation that will disappear in an instance with her latest release titled The Evolution. Although most of the album is much of the same 'crunkness' from her debut album Goodies, there is evidence that she has evolved as an artist. "Promise" is a slow and seductive song that shows the smooth side to Ciara, yet another reason to compare her to the late singer Aaliyah. "So Hard" and "I Found Myself" are two other slow cuts with the latter track sounding more like a ballad than "So Hard" and "Promise." The majority of the rest of the album is the danceable R&B that we are more accustom to hearing from Ciara. She does her thing on songs like the energetic standouts "I Proceed," "That's Right," and "Bang It Up." 50 Cent appears on "Can't Leave Them Alone," one of many mid-tempo tracks that could make their way on the radio in the future. "Get Up" with Chamillionaire was included on this album even though it was also featured on the Step Up soundtrack. Some songs such as the mundane "Like A Boy" or the mediocre "Get In, Fit In" don't really sound like they should have made the cut. And she gives the pre-teen crowd a few 'puppy love' songs like "My Love" and "C.R.U.S.H." that they'll have no problem gravitating towards. The Evolution is still ongoing for Ciara, so for one to expect leaps and bounds on this album would be a misstep. Ciara stays within her comfort zone and gives a solid effort for her follow-up LP.

Incognito is known the world over for their smooth melodic music, whether it be their classic ballads or their upbeat jazz offerings. Guitarist and songwriter Bluey wanted to give long-time listeners and newcomers a twist on the songs that they grew to love and put forward new music to let their imaginations flow free. Some songs on their newest album Bees + Things + Flowers are stripped down to a basic drum beat (the Maysa-assisted "Deep Waters") while others are submerged into a totally different format from what the songs were a part of originally (like the once club hopper now smoothed out "Everyday"). New songs like "Crave" and "You Are Golden" as well as covers like "Everybody Loves The Sunshine" by the incomparable Roy Ayers and "That's The Way Of The World" by the equally talented Earth Wind And Fire take on a whole new meaning on this project. Fans will be surprised by the new renditions and the way you can find a new found love for a song you've listened to for years. Only a group like Incognito can take you on a magical journey that is familiar yet brand new at the same time. Bees + Things + Flowers is a great collection to add to your ever-growing cd collection of good music.

Miss Jackson returns after weathering a controversial storm that seemed to never end. After airing her dirty laundry on Oprah, Janet Jackson released her latest album 20 Y.O. in celebration of the 20 year anniversary of the release of her Control album. And even though 20 Y.O. is good, it's no Control by any means. Nonetheless, fans of Janet should be satisfied with her latest album.Her best songs always seem to be her slow cuts. "With U" is a standout cut with it's similarities to the singing style of older brother Michael. Another track titled "Take Care" will remind you of the simplicity of "Let's Wait Awhile" from her Control album. But "Love 2 Love" is hands down the best slow cut on the entire project, making it really hard not to think about get into something later on tonight!Her mid-tempo cuts are sometimes hit or miss, but thankfully there are more good ones on 20 Y.O. this time around. "Show Me" is an great example of classic Janet being coupled with a more hip chorus then we are accustom to for a Janet album. And songs like "Daybreak" and "Enjoy" are pleasurable because they instantly put you in a delightful mood. The bonus cuts "Roll Witcha" and "Days Go By" are other 'feel good' songs that Janet is known for. "Do It To Me" is only so-so, while "This Body" suffers from probably the worst production on the whole cd. "Call On Me" with Nelly is decent, but lacks the spark we are used to hearing when she does collaborations.Her fast cuts don't really do anything for me. Her new release "So Excited" is only okay with Khia's miniscule involvement being almost unnecessary, and "Get It Out Me" isn't much to write home about either. But all in all, 20 Y.O. is worth it if you're a Janet fan. I know a lot of people expected more from this album, but when you've been in the game for 20+ years, there isn't much more you need to prove.

With any new act, you have to do a little research to get an idea of who the artist is and where they are coming from. The rapper named Chamillionaire hails from the Dirty South, namely Houston, TX. He had a number of albums released independently with newcomer Paul Wall. It's obvious they both caught the eye of the mainstream moguls, and both went their respective ways into the limelight. Paul Wall has made a pretty good name for himself in very little time. He was featured on a bunch of albums by industry A-listers, and continues to keep his voice heard through his collaborations. He also mustered enough notoriety to push his debut mainstream album The People's Champ to the number one spot on the Billboard 200. All this is wonderful....for Paul Wall, but this review is on Chamillionaire. And from hearing The Sound of Revenge, it's clearly obvious who carried the team on those independent albums.There are a couple tolerable tracks, like the Lil Flip-assisted "Turn It Up," "Southern Takeover" featuring the incognito rappers Killer Mike and Pastor Troy, "Rain" featuring hooks by Billy Cook and the incomparable 'Mista Mista' Scarface, "Ridin" featuring Krayzie Bone, and "Picture Perfect" with the unofficial yet deserving Rap Hustler of the Year Bun B. But don't get it twisted...these songs are decent, but it's not because of Chamillionaire. The production on these tracks are decent and the guest vocals are what ultimately make the songs shine, not Chamillionaire. Songs like "No Snitchin" where Chamillionaire does all the lyrics are the true testament on how mediocre he really is. Other solo joints that do nothing for me include the far-from-the-truth "Grown And Sexy," "Peepin Me," "Void In My Life," and the adequately-titled "Frontin." "Think I'm Crazy" featuring Natalie sounds like he was trying to recreate the magic Eminem had when he did a song with Dido. And his lyrics coupled with Lil Wayne on "Fly As The Sky" sounds like a battle to find out who can be the wackest.Chamillionaire has a lot of work to do if he expects to be taken seriously by the rap industry and the listening public. The first thing he might want to do is mend whatever bridges were broken with Paul Wall and go back to basics. Without Paul, I don't see much happening with his career. Secondly, he needs to enlist some real singers for his hooks and not settle on singing the hooks himself or going with anybody that's thrown his way. And lastly, he might want to expound on his lyricism and get some excitement behind his voice. The monotone approach only works for people like Mase, although even he has his moments. And if there truly is any animosity directed towards his former partner-in-rhyme, The Sound of Revenge offers very little retribution for Chamillionaire.

Cherish picked a great time to come out. It's 2006 and there are practically no girl groups to be found. Ten years ago, we had groups like SWV, Jade, Xscape, Total, 702, and Brownstone, while 5 years ago we still had groups like Destiny's Child, 3LW, and TLC. Nowadays, it's almost null and void for girl groups and guy groups in the R&B; world. I guess everybody wants to make 'solo' money instead of splitting everything 3 to 5 ways. But I guess Farrah, Neosha, and twins Felisha and Fallon don't care about all that. After many label woes and a shelved album years back, Unappreciated is the group's one shot at gaining some respect and capturing a cross-section of the R&B; music market.After signing to Jazze Pha's imprint Sho Nuff Records and getting him to do beats for your album, you would think that this album would be banging from beginning to end. But there's not a lot of brilliant songwriting on any of the cuts, and the production is only average most of the time and won't really have anybody praising or complaining about it. But that's what saves the group a lot of the time considering who their target audience is. The debut single "Do It To It" is a good example of the standard formula for making a worthwhile track that teens would gravitate towards. They repeat this for the song "Chick Like Me" featuring Rasheeda, a track that says 'radio friendly' all over it. Other standouts include the title track "Unappreciated," "Whenever," and "Fool 4 U." But their songwriting needs a little tweaking on songs like "Show And Tell," "That Boi," "Taken" and "Chevy." Some average tracks include "Stop Calling Me," "Moment In Time," and "Oooh."A lot of songs on Unappreciated lack anything to keep your attention, and nothing sounded all that original as far as production goes. Luckily, Cherish has plenty of time to work on their lyrics, and maybe next time they'll have better production and a more mature audience to please. But with a teen audience that's dying for some music to relate to these days, Unappreciated will certainly have no problem being cherished by young folks everywhere.

A lot of you may be shocked by the rating this album is receiving. There are a couple of reasons why you might be feeling this way. One of the main reasons might be the notion that you are judging this man by what has happened outside of his musical career. But like a lot of artists of the past, some of the best music ever created was when they were in a time of desperation, heartbreak, or even self-reflection (i.e. Mary J. Blige's My Life or Gerald Levert's Love and Consequences) Eric Benet embodies these emotions and more on his latest disc Hurricane.The first track "Be Myself Again" is more of an extended intro rather than a song, but it sets the tone for the rest of the album and basically points out the faults and true emotions all of us possess. "Hurricane" gives the raw emotion of begging for the perfect storm to come sweep through and rid yourself of all your problems and heartache. "My Prayer" is exactly what it sounds like: a plea to take him back and a promise to be a better person and companion. "Man Enough To Cry," "Where Does The Love Go," and "Cracks of My Broken Heart" are all along those same lines of pouring out the sadness and pain Eric has encountered.Thankfully, the albums isn't all about misfortune and sorrow. "India" is his personal tribute to his daughter of the same name, and "I Know" is his way of confirming that people can change and become a better person in the face of adversity. "Pretty Baby" talks about the women who are have the looks but not the self-respect for themselves or the knowledge of why she can't find the right man. "In The End" is a personal favorite because it is a song about letting you know that everything is gonna be alright with the encouragement of friends and faith in God.There are times where Eric falls flat (the cabaret-sounding "The Last Time" doesn't fit with the rest of the album and "I Wanna Be Loved" sounds too dejected). But if you like Eric's first two albums True To Myself and A Day In The Life, Hurricane will not be a disappointment. So buy this album if you're not caught up in the thought that artists are people with real emotions and shortcomings too.

My boys are back! Pleasure and Pain takes you back to the good ole days of their debut album when the emphasis was put mostly on their crooning abilities. The intro uses the original "Pleasure and Pain" song from their classic first album, and sets the tone for the rest of the cd. Ballads like "Nowhere" and "Why Can't We Get Along" will put 112 fans right back in that nostalgic mood, while captivating songs like "That's How Close We Are" and "What The Hell Do You Want" lend the lead vocals to other members of the group besides Slim. They have improved on their mid-tempo expertise with examples like "My Mistakes," "Last To Know," "Let This Go," and "The Way" featuring Jermaine Dupri. But songs like "God Knows" brings it full circle, showing you that these kind-hearted balladeers were far apart from the hard, rugged image of Bad Boy. If you like 112's earlier work or the sprinkling of ballads and mid-tempo songs over the past eight years, Pleasure or Pain is an album that gives you more of the former than the latter.

Lorenzo Owens garnered a lot of attention when he was a finalist for Oprah Winfrey's PopStar Music Challenge. Picked by many to take the whole thing, Lorenzo's star was shining brighter than ever. Unfortunately for him, the Milwaukee-born singer didn't have enough to come out as the winner of the competition. But exposure is everything, and Lorenzo Owens would eventually find his way to D-Town Records (distributed by WEA). And with the direction of longtime music producer Michael J. Powell, Lorenzo would put out his debut album After The Show in September 2005.Given his ability to make it to the top three out of the 15,000 people competing to be part of the PopStar Music Challenge, Lorenzo Owens has all the talent in the world. Hearing songs like his debut single "Inseparable" will prove to many that he has no problem belting out a power ballad. But by no means is this one of those cheesy power ballads that you would see on American Idol or something. "Inseparable" is powerful in the way he puts his soul out there for all to see and feel. "Rainbows" and "Love's Not Enough" are more like something you'd hear on the aforementioned TV show, but again Owens gives so much of himself that it doesn't come off as a charade."Wanna See You Smile" sounds a lot like another balladeer named Rahsaan Patterson with its delivery and melody, but still comes off as his own in the end. "Close Your Eyes" and "Light 'N Darkness" are two good contenders for a second single if he is lucky enough to get one. "Not So Perfect Love Story" puts you in the mind of an old school R&B; Artist like Bobby Womack. But all the songs aren't stellar, for one reason or another. "Burnin'" is a song with a female vocalist singing the chorus at the beginning of the song, the implementing of a rock guitar, and the subtle yet annoying sound of a phone number being dialed as a sound effect. But the most problematic of all the songs is "Gamble," a track that is decent until the chorus starts with some of the most questionable background singing that you will ever hear. Other songs like "Concentrate" and "Stand Tall" are okay, but lack the energy and vigor that are epitomized on the better tracks.Although not a solid album through and through, After The Storm still proves to be a decent effort from an artist that hasn't reached his fullest potential by any means. But any record exec or true label head shouldn't have any second guesses about signing him to their company and putting out quality material for years to come. He has had an opportunity for the whole world to hear his potential on an international stage, much like the effervescent Latoya London. Lorenzo Owens should definitely keep pushing on and not settle for those 15 minutes of fame that he's already been fortunate enough to have.

The group that brought you so many bangers from the East Coast to your stereo system came out with a Best Of album not too long ago. But, in my opinion, once you have The Reunion by Capone-N-Noreaga, there really is no need for anything else. I'll admit, I didn't even bother buying The War Report because there only only a few songs that I liked on that album (namely T.O.N.Y. and L.A.,L.A.). But The Reunion was practically solid the whole way through. I even liked how they made the first half of the disc 57th Avenue and 41st Side the second half of the disc to represent their blocks. The classic "Bang Bang" with Fox Boogie herself is certified in every sense of the word. And "Queen's Finest" featuring Mobb Deep, Algado and Shoballotti make for a great crew song. Even "B EZ" with Nas represented Queensbridge to the fullest. These were the happy times in Hip-Hop....Capone was out of jail and Noreaga got his focus back after failing on his face with Melvin Flynt Da Hustler. Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection of East Coast bangers.....we're getting fewer and fewer as the years go by!

E-40 used to have songs where you had no clue what the heck he was saying. Now you can understand what he's saying, it's just the new 'slanguage' that throws most of us off from time to time. We all remember the classics like "Captain Save A H--," "Sprinkle Me," and "Player's Ball." But all those jams were more than a decade ago, and most of the bandwagon fans have since departed to countless other rappers. E-40 tries to re-up with My Ghetto Report Card but doesn't quite make the grade."They Might Be Taping" is beyond idiotic, feeding into the paranoia that a lot of thugs already have. "Gouda" with B-Legit is dumber than Jessica Simpson (is that possible?), while "Do Ya Head Like This" has horrible production and the chorus repeats the song title 16...sometimes 32 times! T-Pain gives a painful performance on "U And Dat," UGK makes the mistake of appearing on "White Gurl," a desecration of the Boogie Boys classic "A Fly Girl." "Gimme Head" is vulgar and ridiculous, while "Muscle Cars" with Keak Da Sneak is only good if you're into that type of thing. "Go Hard Or Go Home" is another edgy track more suitable for the club or the streets but "Happy To Be Here" features singing by D. D. Arti....if you can really call it that!Surprisingly, all is not lost though for fans of E-40. The breakout single "Tell Me When To Go" has caused a lot of controversy with the "ghost-ryding" craze sweeping into the streets across America. "Sick Wit It II" reminds me of "Little Ghetto Boy" on Dr. Dre's The Chronic with its overall delivery and verbal assaults interjected between verses. Another song that reminds me of the shucking and jiving from a lot of West Coast classics is "Just F*ckin" with its off-key singing on the chorus. "Yay Area" gives love to the Bay and "She Say She Loves Me" features 8-Ball dropping a convincing verse.E-40 won't get any new fans with My Ghetto Report Card, but long-time followers will probably be satisfied with what he has to offer. But for the typical rap fan, E-40 certainly isn't going to the head of the class any time soon..

Outkast and The Dungeon Family have been a force for over 10 years now. That's amazing considering all the obstacles and sub-par showings by its members. Now with Andre 3000 off to Hollywood, Big Boi goes about the music thang on his own with the help of his new all stars representing the newly-named Purple Ribbon record label (formally Aquemini Records). Some might take all this as a sign that things are going downhill for the group. And that may be the case, but I commend Big Boi for trying to keep some of the artists on his roster relevant to the rap game. People like Sleepy Brown, Bubba Sparxxx, Coool Breeze, and Killer Mike have all made their presence felt in the past but somehow got lost in the shuffle over the years. With Got Purp? Vol II (lord knows what Volume 1 was...maybe a mixtape?), we're all treated to a collection of some good songs as well as a few great ones."Kryptonite" is an infectious first single to reintroduce the world to Killer Mike as well as showcase newcomers Rock D and Black Owned C-Bone. Killer Mike also trade verses with Big Boi on "My Chrome." "Me, My Baby, and My Cadillac" is classic material from Sleepy Brown, "Body Rock" showcases a bunch of Purple Ribbon All Stars, and "Hold On" features the reuniting of Goodie Mob with Cee-Lo Green coming back to make Goodie's best track since 1998's Still Standing. Other notables include the booming "808" featuring Bun B and Big Gee, "What Is This" featuring R&B; newcomer Scar with a second appearance from Cee-Lo, and "Sh** Ya Drawers" featuring Konkrete.There are some missteps on this album, and they come mostly from R&B; singer Janelle Monae. Her singing on "Letting Go" will make any animal run for cover. But her worst showing has to be the booty bass cover of Debarge's "Time Will Reveal" (of course this is self-explanatory!) But it certainly doesn't stop there. Newcomer Scar still falters on the song "U Got Me" with song lyrics more suited for a B5 album. If Big Boi drops Janelle completely and focuses on improving Scar's vocal range, he could very well have a decent R&B; act on his roster like Ludacris has with Bobby Valentino. All in all, Got Purp, Vol. II is still enjoyable, especially the a cappella outro by Big Boi that rivals Sexual Chocolate in Coming To America. You're guaranteed to be in stitches when you hear the outro, but thankfully the whole album isn't a laughing stock.

Sometimes it amazes me that this songstress has managed to last as long as she has. She has definitely represented since day one with songs like "I Am Your Woman" and "Hit On Me" from her debut mainstream album Chapter One: Love, Pain, and Forgiveness as well as "Guess What," "Tonight I'm Gonna Let Go," and the remake of "If You Play Your Cards Right" on Chapter Two: The Voice. Each of those albums represented the title all the way, with the main focus of Chapter One on relationships and Chapter Two expressing her own views and doing things her way. The newest album is entitled Chapter 3: The Flesh. It delivers a little eroticism that isn't as prevalent on her previous work, but Syleena doesn't stray too far from her forte of mid-tempo tracks and stories of dealing with no good men.Syleena jumpstarts the first half of the album with a little energy. The first single "Hypnotic" features R Kelly and Fabolous joining with Syleena to give a radio-friendly track to the masses. Other more upbeat songs are the collabos "Classic Love Song" with Jermaine Dupri, "More" featuring Anthony Hamilton, and "Bullseye (Suddenly)" with Common. And the album wouldn't be complete without the Chicago steppin' song "Special Occasion" featuring R Kelly of course. But once Twista finishes his verse at the beginning of "Phone Sex," Syleena unleashes her sensuality. She follows the song with "Slowly," a song that will have any couple thinking twice about leaving the house. The sexcapade continues on with the casual flow of "Time" and the infectious rhythm of "Still Open." But Chapter 3 wouldn't be complete without a little heartache. Syleena delivers her signature sound at the end of the album with "Another Relationship," "Leave Me Alone," "Apartment For Rent," and "Only A Woman."Like I said in the beginning, I can't believe this woman is still around. It's nothing to do with her talent...she has just as much if not more than any other R&B; artists out there (yes, this includes people like Mary J, Angie Stone, Patti Labelle, and Alicia Keys). I'm talking more about the way she has been promoted throughout the years. Most people would have been dropped from their labels by now considering the sales she has gotten from her first two albums. Maybe the third time will be a charm, and the record company will truly realize that they have winner in the flesh with Syleena Johnson on their roster.

Dj Spinna has been around the corner, up the block, down the street, and everywhere in between when it comes to the music industry. After working with the biggest names in hip-hop, R&B;, jazz, and dance, it's no wonder his name isn't more known amongst most of the listening audience. This may be due to the fact that he doesn't settle for one particular genre of music. Working his deejaying, production, and remixing skills for projects by Michael Jackson, Les Nubians, Rae & Christian, Mos Def, Mary J. Blige, Soulive, and countless others leaves little room for settling down and concentrating on one thing. It's almost like he's all over the place! That's probably the reason for naming his latest release Intergalactic Soul because you won't be able to label his music as being solely one sound.This might scare the ordinary listener, but it's a sigh of fresh air for those looking for more creative minds in music. Look at the recent love for the left that everybody has been giving Andre 3000 of Outkast or Cee-Lo Green of Gnarls Barkley. People are looking for something new and innovative to listen to instead of the same cookie-cutter tracks that make up the Top 40. Dj Spinna focuses more on producing with this album, leaning more towards actual musicianship rather than the usual sample frenzy that most other beatmakers resort to. Listening to a song like "Could It Be Too Soon" featuring jazz newcomer Lizz Fields is a perfect example of pushing the envelope in a new direction. The same can be said for the jazzy tunes of the N'Dea Davenport assisted "Where's The Love" and the borderline soul stirrings of Eric Roberson on "Butterfly Girl" Other songs feature jazz vocals, but offer a different twist for the musical backdrop. "Peace and Quiet" features Stephanie McKay on lead vocals in front of a more mellow drum kick, while "Living My Life" showcases Trish Angus singing over a dance arrangement.But it's not all about jazz fusion on this album by any means. "Current Events" featuring Alphonso Greer and the title track "Intergalactic Soul" featuring Little Brother's Phonte gives us a taste of the hip-hop side of things. And a funk-meets-dance groove is spliced in with the songs "Outta Time" and "Bye Bye Bye" (both featuring The Radicalz) as well as "Back 2U" featuring Selan. Dj Spinna does a few instrumental cuts like "Final Events" and "Computer Love" (not Roger Troutman/Zapp's song) to round out the album's diverse offering. One thing is for sure....Dj Spinna goes global and beyond with Intergalactic Soul. You're guaranteed to have an musical journey that is out of this world.

Now I'm a huge Dave Chappelle fan. Even when he decided to drop off the face of the earth last year, I still stood behind him. He's a mastermind on stage, in movies, and on television. So the next thing for him to do is to branch out and try new things like his recent movie Dave Chappelle's Block Party. I haven't seen the movie, but it's got be great since the soundtrack is basically the performances from the movie. I heard from one person that saw the movie that the live performances weren't in their entirety. Well, the soundtrack fills the void left from the movie.Everything from Black Star's "Definition," Dead Prez's certified classic "Hip-Hop," Jill Scott's "Golden" and "The Way," Mos Def with both "Universal Magnetic" and the crossover hit "Umi Says," Talib Kweli's "The Blast," Common's reuniting with Erykah Badu and Bilal for a live extended version of "The Light," Erykah Badu on "Back In The Day," and The Roots reuniting with Erykah Badu and Jill Scott for "You Got Me." The Roots enlist Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap for "Boom" while Black Star give us "Born And Raised," a new song that apparently wasn't included in the film for some reason.Dave Chappelle's Block Party is a collection of live hits that have helped shape the underground and mainstream Hip-Hop and R&B; scene for the last eight years. If you want to take a trip down memory lane with some of the best live instrumentation and lyrics, this is the soundtrack for you.

Avant has been around for a little while now. Like many other male R&B; crooners, it's been an uphill battle trying to win the hearts of the listening (and buying) public. Avant had a modest start with My Thoughts, breaking out a solid remake of "My First Love" with Keke Wyatt. But after subsequent albums that have been okay at best, many people have coined him as a knock-off R. Kelly. Out to prove them all wrong, Avant tries again with the strangely-titled Director. Lucky for him, the songs on the album are good enough to overlook the horrible title."So Many Ways" starts off the album with a smooth groove that embodies the signature Avant sound. "This Is Your Night" continues the soul serenade, followed by his first single "You Know What" with a lyrical gift from the reinvented Lil Wayne. His new single "4 Minutes" is very formulaic in its approach, a characteristic that a lot of R&B; cats suffer from these days. The Urban Remix of the Pussycat Dolls song "Stickwitu" does little for this album, along with "With You." Luckily, Lloyd Banks saves the day midway through the album with his cameo on "Exclusive." "Right Place, Wrong Time" is a decent enough cut for radio, with other possible follow-ups being "Imagination" or "Mr. Dream."Other pretty good offerings include "Grown @ss Man," "Director," and "Lie About Us." The mellow tune "Now You Have Someone" and the Jermaine Dupri-assisted "G.P.S.A. (Ghetto Public Service Announcement)" should have never been made public in the first place. Avant has a pretty good offering this time around. With the proper promotion and some strategic maneuvers, Director could very well be a contender for being his breakout album.

With over 13 years of being in the rap game, 8Ball and MJG have seen the ups and downs of the industry through first-hand experience. They also know that the landscape of Hip-Hop has changed about a dozen times since their 1993 debut albumComin' Out Hard. With modest success from being on various independent labels (most notable being Suave House), the crew was signed to Bad Boy by Diddy and released their major label debutLiving Legendsin 2004. Still getting much of the same buzz as they did when they were on top of the underground scene, they did sell in excess of 750,000 copies (more than Diddy was able to do withPress Playin 2006). So with the release of Ridin High, the duo are hoping to at least match that success, but actually take a step backwards in the end. The album starts off pretty good with songs like the radio-friendly "Cruzin" featuring Project Pat and Slim of 112, the grimy anthem "Relax And Take Notes" featuring Notorious B.I.G. (per Diddy's request I'm sure), and the energetic, bass-heavy "Turn Up The Bump." Pimp C rolls through to rep for Houston on "Watchu Gonna Do," Killer Mike resurfaces for the entertaining track "Running Out Of Bud," Yung Joc makes a so-so appearance for the thumping "Clap On," and Jazza Pha and Juvenile bring all of their talents on board for "Pimpin Don't Fail Me Now" (a play on the chorus to Missy Elliott's "Pussycat"). Unfortunately there are huge missteps with a couple of tracks on this album. Diddy obnoxious presence in the background of the over-produced title track and his vocals on "30 Rocks" bring down the album tremendously. "Hickory Dickory Dock" (yes, you read that right) is just bad all around, and "Alcohol, Pu$$y, and Weed" is another bad attempt at making a Pop-sounding Dirty South track. "Get Low" is poorly produced and lyrically dormant, while "Take It Off" featuring Poo Bear is a futile attempt at recreating the feel of their former hit "Space Age Pimpin." This will probably spell the end of their mainstream run, but 8Ball & MJG obviously have the potential to be chart-topping superstars. But when you have a label that doesn't have much experience with producing and promoting albums from the Dirty South, it usually spells disaster for all.

The Milwaukee-born, Maryland-bred Tank has resurfaced after five years of being off the musical radar. But the producer and songwriter has been busy working on recent albums by Ruben Studdard, Monica, Joe, and Donell Jones. His most recognizable work is probably the songs "VIP," "Do What It Do" and "Wish U Were Here" from Jamie Foxx's critically acclaimed Unpredictable album. Now that he's studied and experienced what it takes for a stellar R&B album, he offers up Sex, Love, And Pain for all to enjoy. Right out the gate, he hits you with a rather unique amalgamation called "Coldest" that is best described as an intro/track/epilogue that runs nearly 7 minutes. After the sweet "I'm Coming Home" and the alluring "My Body," we are blessed with the dynamic lead single "Please Don't Go." Another album standout follows in the mid-tempo cut "I Hate U," a serious contender at being the next single off the disc. "Heartbreaker" is a self-explanatory tune that points to the 'Pain' in the album title. "Who Dat" does the same thing, only this time showing the jealous side of a former boyfriend. "When" is a great slow jam for the ladies, while the horribly produced "Wedding Song" would've been better if it was left off the album. Luckily he makes up for the misstep with the simple, piano-laced "My Heart." He closes the album with the melodious "I Love U" and the less-than-satisfying Timbaland remix of "I Love Them Girls." There are four bonus cuts spread across other versions of Sex, Love, & Pain that were not reviewed since they are not part of the widely-distributed version of the album. Maybe those will make up for "Wedding Song" and the "I Love Them Girls" remix that bring this album down from being an otherwise stellar album.

I'm not even sure if these cats are R&B crooners or Rap since they do both on this album.....so put Crooners and Rap together....and you have Crap! This is by far one of the worst albums I've ever heard to date! It's up there with Dalvin Degrate solo album and Missy's latest! But I can't give this a thorough review because I did not muster up enough bravery to actually sit and waste 60 minutes of my life. Besides the blatant attempt to appeal to teenagers (all of them are grown by the way), their subject matter alone does them in most of the time. Songs like "Juicy," "Playhouse," "Shorty Be Mine" and "Nothing But A Number" will land them in jail in most states if they actually did this to any of their teenage fan base. And their debut single (actually titled "Grind On Me") is too raunchy and wack to even bother with. It's almost like B2K and Crucial Conflict made an collabo album together...but even that would have been better than this ridiculous record.

Talib is a one-man wrecking crew, breaking down fools that just don't have a clue. He makes a living out of terrorizing emcees. and his wordplay makes all the haters get down on their knees. Wishing for a halt to his verbal assault, but it's not his fault if they're reduced down to a grain of salt. Okay, I'll stop now while I'm ahead and leave the rest to the professionals! Talib Kweli would run circles around me and most lyricists in the game today. Don't forget when Jay-Z said "Lyrically, he'd be Talib Kweli." Even with the acknowledgement, Talib keeps his eyes on the prize and finally unleashes Ear Drum at a time when true hip-hop is suffering. The early teaser "Listen" grabbed everybody's attention, but the climate for rap music was steadily getting more watered down with garbage on the radio and in videos. After much delay and anticipation, Ear Drum delivers with songs like the hard-hitting anthem "Say Something" featuring Blacksmith signee Jean Grae, the smoothness of "Country Cousins" with Raheem Devaughn and UGK, and the radio-friendly "Hot Thing" with emcee/producer Will.i.am. Die hard fans will enjoy the old school feel of "Eat To Live," as well as "The Perfect Beat" with KRS-One. The laid-back groove "In The Mood" has a decent showing by Kanye West and the superb musicianship of Roy Ayers. The album closes with three bonus cuts, with "Go With Us" featuring Strong Arm Steady being the best of the bunch. The journey throughout Ear Drum is so captivating, the only disappointment is when the album reaches the end! Whether it's Common, Pharoahe Monch, or Talib, real Hip-Hop is finally back and better than ever. Really, it's up to the Hip-Hop community, the radio programmers, and the music-buying public to determine the fate of rap music.

Soul music is probably the easiest sound to replicate. Every genre from country, to hip-hop, to jazz, to blues can pull elements of soul into it. That's probably why it's the hardest category to break when it comes to success on the chart. Usually it's the artists that get down deep into their own souls who have the most success when it comes to album sales. Think about it. The best albums from your favorite soul artists are usually the ones that you can either relate to yourself or that you felt was their most compelling when it came to stories they told. Both of those things bring out the true essence of soul music. That's probably why Corinne Bailey Rae has gotten so much buzz as of late because you can put on her self-titled album and your almost instantaneously engulfed in her world."Like A Star" is a great choice to start off the album with considering the uncomplicated lyrics and the tranquility that she shows on the song. It leads right into the serene nature of "Enchantment" but then she changes gears with the self-liberating debut single "Put Your Records On." "Til It Happens To You" will remind you of the bluesy sound of a Norah Jones, along with the moody "Trouble Sleeping." "Call Me When You Get This" is a ambient yet funky groove that is worthy of being another radio single. Corinne belts out a couple heartfelt ballads over the smooth tune "Choux Pastry Heart" and the harmonious track "Breathless." She closes out the album with the upbeat, jazz-inspired "I'd Like To," the heartening nature of "Butterfly" and the leisurely mood of "Seasons Change."Although the album only clocks in at just over 45 minutes, Corinne gives you more than enough to enjoy. It remains to be seen if the world will truly embrace Corinne Bailey Rae, but after one listen you'll agree that she is definitely a force to be reckoned with. Do yourself a favor and grab Corinne Bailey Rae for a truly organic experience.

We got ourselves a winner in John Legend. John Stephens (before he was dubbed a Legend) is at the top of the R&B game right now. He was in the background for awhile, popping up on songs by Dilated Peoples, Alicia Keys, and his main man Kanyizzle (Kanye West). With promotional tours and opening shows for people, Legend gave us a little anticipation with his album. That is rare these days when debut artists just pop up and have an album a few weeks later that the labels seriously think somebody's gonna buy (Brooke Valentine, Ricky Fante, Nivea, and so on). John Legend proved to the listeners that he deserves your attention...and did it rather eloquently. The always-humble Legend dropped an album the whole FAMILY can enjoy. There are jive turkey songs like "Alright" and "She Don't Have To Know," fun songs like "Used To Love You" and "Let's Get Lifted" and thought-provoking songs like "Ordinary People" But the best songs on the album have to be the emotion-driven "So High" and "Live It Up," the theme song for weekends and vacations. The only detraction is the Snoop Dogg collabo "I Can Change" which should have been saved for a standout single for a soundtrack. But even with that minor blip on the radar, John Legend is flying high in the clouds with an astonishing debut album.

Slum Village has gone through a lot of revamping over the years. It all started with Jay Dee, Baatin, and T3 on their debut release Fantastic, Vol. 2 (there was no Volume 1, although some point to their demo as the first installment.) The collective continued with Elzhi joining the group (after losing super producer Jay-Dee) for Trinity: Past, Present, and Future. The group finally manifested to just T3 and Elzhi for Detroit Deli (now missing the schizophrenic Baatin). Fighting to stay in the game and keep the Slum Village name relevant, they release Prequel To A Classic in early 2005. By this point, they've discovered their direction and purpose and are ready to start all over again to validate their existence. The rock-solid duo release their self titled Slum Village album in hopes of doing just that."Multiply" resurrects the signature Slum Village sound that Fantastic, Vol. 2 fans will appreciate the most. "Set It" is an upbeat track that promises to make your head bob back and forth to the beat. "Call Me" features long-time collaborator Dwele singing the hook over an Isley Brother sample that is done like no other song. "05" gives a retrospective of their ongoing transformation as a group and utilizes live instrumentation for a change of pace from the norm. Slum Village dives deeper and gives even more particulars regarding their constant reconstruction with the song "Def Do Us." Other stand outs include the energetic "Ez Up," the equally upbeat "Hear This," and the poignant "Can I Be Me."Slum Village (simply known to "day one fans" as just 'Slum' ) has done all that it can do to satisfy the powers that be. They finally arrived at the right formula of beats, rhymes, and life to get their point across to the masses. Now, if the masses don't respect them for their work or just simply want a 'canned' product, then they can continue listening to same songs repeat over and over again on these Top 40 radio stations. Slum Village is an album that only true hip-hop fans can appreciate anyways, so T3 and Elzhi won't have to worry about any devoted followers running for the hills any time soon.

Success in the R&B; market or for any genre is all about timing. Just ask people like Grenique or Caron Wheeler whose albums came out before the explosion of Neo Soul music. Even Kenny Lattimore and Sam Salter had to contend with the newly-discovered crooning of Maxwell and D'angelo. Recent years can be labeled as the R Kelly/Usher era with both singers dominating the R&B; charts the last six years. Sure, people like Ginuwine, Jagged Edge, and Joe have had modest success, but others like Dave Hollister, Case, Avant, and Donell Jones never mustered quite enough attention of the R&B; world despite the fact that most of their releases were commendable. Jaheim has seen all of this unfold during his previous two debut albums as well. While he has managed to go platinum with both albums, he hasn't been able to push above the glass ceiling to superstar status. With many other R&B; albums crowding the market, Ghetto Classics is a good attempt at getting to the top of the game.This release is easily Jaheim's best album to date. He stayed away for awhile, but those that are serious about their craft are known to do this. These types of artists tend to utilize all the time it takes to make their albums the best they can be. Otherwise, you have material from some of today's singers who simply push product without any care for how they sound. Jaheim obviously took his time, and it's evident in the breakout single "Everytime I Think About Her" featuring the gritty verses by both him and Jadakiss. It follows the formula suggested in the album title of representing the street along with keeping with the old school sound that everybody has coined for Jaheim.Heartfelt ballads are a-plenty on this album. Songs like the truthful "Daddy Thing," and the genuine "I Ain't Never" are standout slow jams. Other cuts like "125th," "Masterpiece," and "Come Over" are smooth in their delivery as well. He gives us a good dose of the matchless mid-tempo melodies like "The Chosen One," "Conversation," and "Forgetful." "Fiend" featuring Styles P and "Like A DJ" are good tracks, but they offer some questionable lyrics that may have a few listeners wondering where Jaheim is going with each song. However, besides those two minor speed bumps in the middle of the album, Ghetto Classics lives up to its title and more.

Tony Rich has traveled a long, drawn-out road of mediocrity and disappointment. After breaking out with the monstrous single "Nobody Knows" on the debut album Words, it was pretty much downhill from there. I'm one of the only people that could even tolerate Birdseye, but even I couldn't compare it to Words. I don't even think anybody even knew there was an independent album called Resurrected that came out back in 2003. And few people will probably even hear his latest independent release title Pictures either. Unfortunately for Tony Rich, they aren't missing a whole heck of a lot.I mean, there are a few songs that are decent cuts for the guy who brought us Words. "Somethin' About You" is a standout track that is worthy of radio airplay. "Beautiful" and "Gone Girl" are pretty decent cuts as well. But besides those three cuts, there are no other songs that will even keep your attention. The falsetto on "Don't Be Worried" will leave you asking "Is this guy serious?" "R U Breathin?" is like a bad rip of a Lenny Kravitz cut, while "Would U Lie?" would have been better if Prince had done it. The same can be said for "U My Girl," a song that I can hear Jamiroquai rocking for an upcoming single.Tony Rich has struggled to find his sound (or even an listening audience) and has practically fallen short at every turn. At least he knows that he can't match the crisp, refined sound that he showcased on Words. I guess this is a perfect example of when Pictures aren't worth a thousand words, but rather three words.... GIVE IT UP!

The Wu-Tang standout is finally back where he should be. After a few stray shots that haven't been received well by many fans, Ghostface resurfaces with an album that is arguably his best since his Ironman album. But we had to live through albums like Supreme Clientele, Bulletproof Wallets, and the Pretty Toney Album to get to this one. And even though there are a few classic tracks on those middle albums, they didn't come anywhere near his debut album. Obviously the critics and fans penetrated his head enough for him to take his time to get his focus back. Now Ghost drops Fishscale, the beginning of a second wind for the Wu alum.From the start of the album, it becomes apparent that Ghostface ain't playing this time around. After an vicious introduction, Ghost goes right into overdrive with "Shakey Dog," a standout track that will put you right back to the Ironman days. He continues the same feel when he pairs off with RaekwonThe Chef once again on head-rocking "Kilo." "The Champ" is the dis track that the underground has been eating up since the album started getting leaked. "9 Milli Bros" brings the Wu-Tang Clan collective back together to show that the crew is ready to make things right again. After a few skits, Ghost drops a short story on "Crack Spot." The Chef Raekwon returns on "R.A.G.U.," another prime example of the what the game's been missing for the last 10 years. "Whip You With A Strap" is a narrative about the good ole days when you could whoop your kids without Child Protective Services knocking at your door."Back Like That" featuring R&B;'s newest sensation Ne-Yo is a story about a girlfriend who gets back at her unfaithful boyfriend by sleeping with his arch enemy. "Be Easy" featuring Trife is nothing short of a rockin' house party record. Trife also guests on the aggressive "Clipse of Doom." "Jellyfish" featuring Cappadonna, Shawn Wigs, and Trife could have had a better beat but still offers first-rate lyrics nonetheless. "Dogs Of War" features a marathon of verses from Ghostface, Raekwon, Cappadonna, Trife, and Sun God. "Big Girl" is just like Nas' "You're A Big Girl Now" only Ghostface resorts to rapping over the entire original song by the Stylistics! "Underwater" is an unnecessary addition, but it doesn't detract too much from the rest the album. "Momma" features superb lyrics from Ghost and an 'Ashanti clone' named Megan Rochell. "Three Bricks" closes out the album with guest vocals from Raekwon and a borrowed verse from the late Notorious B.I.G.Ghostface Killah should be very happy with the work to took to make Fishscale so spectacular. And with fans and critics hailing this as the biggest release of 2006 so far, it will no doubt be the unofficial resurrection of his career if not the whole Wu-Tang Clan family. This album is competitively-priced to get consumers to take a chance on this project. But Fishscale is easily one of those discs that actually would have been worth dropping your 15 bucks on.

Lil Wayne has been around the block for quite some time now. He's seen the good times and the bad times with Cash Money. Having gone through the departure of in-house producer Mannie Fresh, many thought that spelled the end of the Cash Money crew. But that's the last thing on the mind of Lil Wayne and company. Like many other obstacles that they've faced, Cash Money weathered the storm (including Hurricane Katrina!) So the release of The Carter II is a new beginning not only for Lil Wayne but Cash Money as a whole. And with outside production and a new outlook on life, Lil Wayne shows and proves on his latest effort."The Mobb" and "Fly In" start off The Carter II and are surprisingly good songs with their East Coast production. "Hustlaz Music" is another banger using the East Coast sound, as well as the enchanting "Receipt" and upfront honesty of "Feel Me." "Lock And Load" with Kurupt (not sure where he was on the song ...maybe the chorus?) is Lil Weezy's solid attempt at rocking a West Coast beat. He does the same on "Weezy Baby" and "Get Over" (both featuring Nikki), blending a Dr Dre-type beat with some funk elements as well. "Mo Fire" is a reggae-tinged jam that Lil Wayne pulls off with a modified, slower approach that most aren't used to hearing. "Grown Man" featuring Currency doesn't have the greatest singing on the hook but the lyrics by both rappers and the cool background music make it tolerable. "Shooter" actually has Weezy rapping over `bluesy rock' track that is reminiscent of a Lenny Kravitz song.The weird thing about The Carter II is the fact that the almost all the songs that have the Cash Money sound are the weakest tracks. "Fireman" is probably the only acceptable tracks with that type of production, with "Money On My Mind" and "I'm A Dboy" featuring Birdman both lacking any appeal at all. "Best Rapper Alive" is not only untruthful, but the rock-n-roll riffs make it more of a Heavy Metal track than a rap track. And the background sample on the song "Oh No" makes you say just that....Oh No!It's nice to hear Lil Wayne over beats that actually complement his style rather than those that overpower it. True, he has a few songs he probably could have scrapped to make this a guaranteed sell for all rap fans, but overall he did a good job of mixing genres and being creative with a track. I think that's why I enjoyed the album so much, and why I think you will too. The departure of Mannie Fresh looked to be the end of the road, but it actually turned out to be the start of something good. Even though I've never been a fan of Lil Wayne, he's actually proven to me that he's the real deal with The Carter II. To my surprise, I'm actually looking forward to his next release for a change.

Maysa has been one of those artist who has been constantly looked over when you go to the store and look in the music racks. Yes, she's the artist who you'd typically say "I've never heard of her" and yet you probably have heard her. She was once the female vocalist in the jazz fusion group Incognito. She was the voice behind songs like "Deep Waters" and "Still A Friend Of Mine" for all you jazz listeners out there. She has had four solo albums, the first three being the self-titled album Maysa, All My Life, and Out Of The Blue respectively. Now she returns with another jazz-influenced album entitled Smooth Sailing.The first single from the album is the title track "Smooth Sailing," a good representation of what the rest of the album sounds like. "Scat World" features her alongside another relatively unknown songstress named Ledisi. The best song on the disc hands down is "All Day Long" with solid background singers and top notch production that few others are able to manage to get for their own songs. This same style is continued on the song "Where Have You Been" and "One More Chance." But there is some fun elements as well on songs like "So Very Hot" and "Hypnotic."Although not her best work, Maysa still proves that she is the best at what she does. But even though her songs sound overtly R&B;, she is usually placed in the genre that most appreciates her....Smooth Jazz. Despite the flip-flopping of categories, Maysa is hands down a wonderful vocalist and Smooth Sailing is a voyage that you can still enjoy without getting seasick.

The Baddest Chick is back on the scene with a new release, only this time she bares all! Okay, this isn't a skin flick, but rather an up-close, in-your-face view of the life and times of Trina. Representing Slip-N-Slide to the fullest, the raunchy rapper gives her fans a behind-the-scenes look at not only her rap career in general, but also her videos as well as a live concert performance. It is actually three different concerts that are spliced together quite uniquely to say the least.She performs all of her hits as well as some verses from her guest spots on other artists' work. From "Nann" to "B R Right" to "No Panties" to "Here We Go," Trina drops it like it's hot from one track to the next. Despite some of the amateurish video footage for her documentary, fans will still appreciate the offering on Live and Uncut.

Monica has had a career of ups and downs. She started out pretty decent with her debut album Miss Thang. Her second album The Boy Is Mine was the pinnacle of her career, with the platinum single "The Boy Is Mine" easily the number one song that everybody remembers from Monica. She showed a little edginess then when she traded verses with Brandy on the song. But no one could have foreseen the future, as Miss Thang gets a little attitude and turns into Miss Ghetto Booty for her latest album The Makings Of Me."Everytime The Beat Drops" is the first example of her newfound ghetto mentality, enlisting the help of Dem Franchise Boyz for the hip-hop portion. Missy Elliott produces a lackluster song with a retro feel to it titled "A Dozen Roses." Monica then reverts back to a potty mouth for "Sideline Ho," an attempt at sounding 'street' to address all the hood rats putting up with the no-good men out here. The fruitless songs continue with the mundane "Why Her" and "Hell No" featuring Twista. "Doin Me Right" features more foul-mouth antics from Monica and lazy production from Missy. Swizz Beatz provides an uninspiring beat for another street anthem titled "Raw." She switches up to a smoothed out ballad called "My Everything" that we are more accustom to hearing from the ATL native. Missy gives another snoozer of a beat with "Gotta Move On" while "Getaway" is another power ballad that comes off as a wonderful Monica classic.It becomes clearly evident while listening to The Makings Of Me that Monica didn't really have much of a platform for this album. It basically sounds like a bunch of singles that were recorded over the years and slapped together to make up a 10-track collection that she calls an album. Taking in all of her previous successes, it's a shame that The Makings Of Me is the last thing people will remember Monica by. With the flop of her previous cd After The Storm as well as the inevitable demise of The Makings Of Me, she probably won't have another album after this considering there wasn't much of one this time around.

It goes without saying that Marques Houston has grown up right before our eyes. You all remember when he was running around with Immature with their eccentric outfits and Marques sporting his 'whipped' hairdo that had a lot of girls getting jealous because his hair looked way better than theirs. More than fifteen years later, that little boy is now a grown man doing music for all the mature crowd (and doing it well) with his latest album titled Veteran. After getting past the obvious radio-friendly club cut "Like This" featuring Yung Joc, the rest of the album is stellar. "Always & Forever" is a smooth, falsetto-driven track that gets the mood going, "Favorite Girl" (the original single from months ago) is fun and light-hearted, and the current single "Circle" is a certified R&B chart topper that will definitely catch the attention of the young ladies out there. Along those same lines is the song "Wonderful" with its simple piano backdrop and straightforward lyrics as well as "Hold N' Back" with incognito songstress Mya and Shawnna providing that extra special touch to an already dynamic melody. Songs like "Exclusively" "So Right For Me" and "How You Just Gonna" will remind longtime listeners of the later contemporary sound of IMx. "Kimberly" is a nice dedication song (especially for girlfriends named Kimberly) while "Miss Being Your Man" is one of those 'regret' songs for the fellas instead of the ladies. Marques Houston outdid himself with this album. You could see the obvious transitions to more mature material over the years, but it became more obvious with the release of his last album Naked. Veteran is a great album from an artist who is ready to take on the Grown and Sexy crowd.

We all loved Biggie when he was here. We all still love him even though he's gone. Those two things will never change. That's probably why he's had more albums after his death than before his unfortunate departure (remember, his double cd came out AFTER he died...not before). Diddy knows everybody loves Biggie and that is the reason why he keeps putting out all these concocted albums (and probably because he hasn't been able to find anybody to bring in as much money as B.I.G. since!). So when I heard that Diddy was putting out yet ANOTHER album with a million cameos, in my mind I immediately labeled it as "Born Again 2." That would be the most obvious title, but Diddy couldn't go with this title considering Born Again wasn't highly touted. So what's the best alternative? Let's call it Duets: The Final Chapter. Oh, brother. Considering most of the songs have more than one other person on it, Duets isn't really accurate. And truth be told, the final chapter should've truly been Life After Death. But Duets isn't totally bad, but it isn't totally good either.The production is pretty decent on the majority of the album, something that was surely lacking on Born Again. And luckily they found a lot of lyrics most of us aren't familiar with to utilize for some of the songs. The huge list of cameos is almost endless. You can almost name any big or mediocre artist off the top of your head, and they are probably involved with this project. Let's start Roll Call with Faith Evans and The Game who showcase with Biggie on the divine "1970 Somethin." Bone Thugs partner with Twista to bring fire to "Spit Your Game," a song which derives from Biggie's real collaboration with Bone from Life After Death's "Notorious Thugs." "Whatchu Want" features a glimpse of what could have been reality had Biggie and Jay-Z actually got to form The Commission. "Living In Pain" pairs Big with his competition at the time, namely 2pac and Nas. It also features Mary J. Blige, the very person Biggie first got his early shine on with. Other notable tracks include "Breakin' Old Habits" with T.I. and Slim Thug, the surprisingly decent "Ultimate Rush" with Missy, "Just A Memory" with The Clipse, and the posse cut "Get Your Grind On" featuring Freeway, Fat Joe, and Big Pun (R.I.P.).Some songs were just mediocre, like "Living The Life" with Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Faith Evans, "The Most Shady" with Eminem, Obie Trice, and Diddy, and "Hustler's Story" with Akon, Big Gee, and Scarface. But there are a couple songs that should have been reworked or never created in the first place. "Nasty Girl" with Jagged Edge, Diddy, Avery Storm, and Nelly is okay except it sounds entirely like a Nelly track (which it actually is on Nelly's repackaged "Sweatsuit"). "I'm Wit' Whateva" featuring Lil Wayne, Juelz Santana, and Jim Jones has some Michael Myers/Halloween sounding music and the lyrics from all three guest artists don't even come close to enjoyable. "Beef" with Mobb Deep could have been so much better with a better beat. "Mi Casa" featuring R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson is pointless, "Hold Your Head" with Bob Marley is lackluster, and the sinister "Wake Up Now" with Korn is downright insane.Biggie truly deserved to have a legacy that would have rivaled 2pac's. If he had as many albums and as many years as 2pac, B.I.G. would have been just as immortal as him. But frankly, Biggie was your around-the-way guy who didn't put up any fronts on being this or that. Sure, he dreamed like everybody else, but his way of painting life was believable and true. So, in essence, he probably is better off not being immortalized. It just wasn't who he was. Now if only somebody could explain that to Diddy.

Happy Days are here again with the release of a greatest hits album by 90's mega group Silk. If you were a true R&B fan in the 90s then you were a fan of Silk's music. They had countless hits in their collection, and The Best of Silk highlights practically all of them. If you include the opening interlude, there are SIX tracks from their first album Lose Control on this greatest hits disc. They are the opening "Interlude," "Happy Days," "Freak Me," "Lose Control," "Girl U For Me," and "It Had To Be You." They also include two remixes of "Happy Days" and "Freak Me" at the end of the disc. Songs from their self-titled second album include "I Can Go Deep" (which was also from A Low Down Dirty Shame Soundtrack), "Hooked On You," and "Don't Rush." Songs from Tonight consist of "Let's Make Love," "If You (Lovin' Me)," "The Return," and "Meeting In My Bedroom." "We're Callin' You" is the only song from their last album Love Session with all the original crew. Thankfully they didn't include anything from their independent album that was released minus Little G. All in all, this was a good package of solid hits. You should definitely add The Best of Silk to the collection if you don't already own the original albums.

Touted as the fresh new face to R&B;, John Legend has the world in his hands. After winning countless awards for Get Lifted and touring worldwide in support of the album, John Legend had little time to reflect on his successes. Instead, he had to focus on the biggest hurdle of any artist in their career....the risk of your follow-up album flopping harder than a flapjack on the floor. Well, with Once Again, John Legend does the unthinkable...he goes into left field and stays there! The soul singer goes the experimental route and some fans might drop their jaws right next to that flapjack after the first listen. But true fans will love the new direction that John Legend is taking with Once Again.You definitely have to be in a mood to listen to this album, although it is just as great as background music at work. I'll be blunt though...my first listen literally had me bewildered. The first single "Save Room" was a total shock. The super sappy lounge feel didn't sit well with me. Thankfully the whole album isn't like that song, but it does keep in line with being outside of the norm. "Heaven Only Knows" has a touch of soul, while "Stereo" sounds like much the same, only with a more up-to-date hip-hop beat accompanying the flashback groove. "Show Me" sounds like a whimsical journey to some island retreat, while "Each Day Gets Better" drifts back to the dusties of old that your parents probably grew up on. "P.D.A. (We Just Don't Care)" is about loving your significant other in front of the world and not giving a damn what they think."Slow Dance" really marries the old school quartet sound with a piano riff and drum kick that is more in line with today's music. "Again" follows that same formula but comes off as creative rather than a fabrication or an overt attempt at sounding old school. "Maxine" will put you in a dreamy state with its airy background and soft delivery. "Where Did My Baby Go" is a simple piano-laced track about missing your loved one so much that it consumes you. "Another Again" is another light sonnet with more soul coming out of Legend than on most other tracks. "Coming Home" talks about the never-ending war and how we will eventually get back to normal again one day. The hidden bonus track is the closest thing to anything on Get Lifted, with practically no old school influences.John Legend is stepping out on faith with Once Again. He could lose a few people with this album considering how drastically different it is from Get Lifted. It's so different that the casual listener will probably dismiss it after one listen. Although I must admit that it took awhile for the songs to grow on me, it still wasn't what I expected. I basically assumed it would be another Get Lifted and I would play the cd a million times like I did with that album. But John Legend is hoping that fans will allow themselves to think with an open mind for this album. Think about it...he's probably accomplished more than he ever thought he would. So coming out with Once Again was his way of showing the world his extensive range when it comes to music. I can tell you this much...John Legend definitely pushed the envelope with this one.

The name Webbie says it all. With a name like that, how can you really take this person seriously. The only Webbie that comes into mind is Webbigal "Webby" Vanderquack from Duck Tales. And after hearing the uncut version of "Give Me That," it was clear that this all came from a young feeble mind. Somehow he was convinced to name his album Savage Life like he was the Crocodile Hunter or something. Can you really have a "Savage Life" and only be 19-years-old?Besides the unjustifiable title and the inexcusable choice for a name, there were even more atrocious decisions surrounding the song selections on Savage Life. The album features four collaborations with buddy Lil Boosie. Two songs featuring these two rappers include "Full of Dat Sh*t" and "U Don't Want That," an obvious indication to spend your money elsewhere. And the idiotic assertions don't end there by any means. With disrespectful titles like "Come Here B*tch" featuring Mannie Fresh, "Gutta B*tch," and the original version of "Bad B*tch" as well as the remix featuring the baddest b*tch Trina.And if that isn't enough, the limited vocabulary expressed on this album is a sign that somebody needs to go back to school. Like his song with B.G., you "Gotta Show Me You Worth It." And with Savage Life, Webbie isn't showing up anywhere near my stereo any time soon.

Rick Ross has accomplished so much in the last few months. He captured the attention of the entire hip-hop community with the infectious single "Hustlin." With the instant fanfare behind that song, the ringtone went on to sell Platinum, making him the first artist to accomplish that task before the accompanying album is even released. Then once Port of Miami was released, he shocked industry insiders buy blowing out all other albums and debuting number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart. This Cinderella story sounds great, until you actually sit down and listen to the album.Port of Miami starts off extremely strong, with the powerful second single "Push It," the thumping "Blow," the certified single of the year "Hustlin'," and the surprisingly good collaboration with Akon for "Cross That Line." But then things take a dramatic turn from that point on. "I'm Bad" has a corny beat behind it, but does show that Rick Ross can rhyme at a fast pace if he wants to. "Boss" is bizarre, "For Da Low" is a Jazze Pha production that does nothing for Ross, "Where My Money" has an outright annoying chorus, and the singing by Mario Winans on "Get Away" was a major mistake to say the least."Hit U From The Back" is somewhat okay, but again the chorus is not well refined. "White House" goes right back to the drug dealing tales and "Pots and Pans" follows the same formula. Lyfe Jennings does little to help "It's My Time," and Lloyd's singing also hinders "Street Life" even though it still wouldn't be good if he was replaced or taken off the song. Rick Ross does give us the remix for "Hustlin'" featuring guest vocals from the seemingly unbreakable duo of Jay-Z and Young Jeezy. He closes the album with the mediocre "It Ain't A Problem" with the Carol City Cartel, the unimpressive "I'm A G" featuring Lil Wayne and Brisco, and the decent lyrics and production on "Prayer."With repetitive storylines and a drawn out lyrical flow, Rick Ross has a lot of growth to go through before he reaches his dreams of being at the top of the game. Until that time, he'll need to focus on staying relevant and learning from all the mistakes he made with Port of Miami.

Raheem Devaughn is the hands-down R&B; newcomer of the year! That's a bold statement considering most people probably never even heard the name Raheem Devaughn before. Some of you might have been lucky enough to have heard his first single "Guess Who Loves You More" on your local radio station or satellite radio channel. But if that's all you heard, you are in for a real treat in his debut album entitled The Love Experience. Raheem takes you on a whirlwind of love, heartache, and everything in between.Take for instance "Ask Yourself," a stand-out single that takes you back to the good old days of Prince and Marvin Gaye when they practically tantalized women with their songs. This notion is further repeated in the songs "Breathe" and "You," but each track stands on its own despite the seductive characteristics they all have. But the title track "The Love Experience" digs a little deeper in describing the different situations that we all go through when dealing with love. "Where I Stand" is Raheem's effort at getting into the mind of a girl who can't make up her mind on whether they will be more than friends.But the album isn't all romance. "Green Leaves" is an attempt at giving advice on enriching your life and aspiring to do more regardless of the obstacles that get in the way. "Catch 22" is basically Raheem's story about how pushing forward and ultimately ending up right where you started and accomplishing very little in the end. He goes further into the everyday struggles in "Until," basically exclaiming that we shouldn't judge each other because we don't know anything about how good or bad another person's got it. "Who" is his dialogue on how we need to start caring about what goes on in the rest of the world and not being self-centered and concerned only with our own lives.Raheem Devaughn is a well-rounded artist with a lot of things on his mind. With The Love Experience, he gives you a piece of his soul and hopes you will see that there is more to love and life than what conventional wisdom tells us.

A lot of people didn't think she could forge a comeback. After her one-hit wonder "Heard It All Before," there was a lot of doubt that Sunshine Anderson would ever surface again. But here she is, some 6 years later, trying again with her sophomore release Sunshine At Midnight. The title's almost as ridiculous as how the songs on this album sound. The background on "Something I Wanna Give You" is too overbearing and "Trust" has a rocked out beat that nobody is checking for when it's coupled with Sunshine's uninteresting lyrics. The production kills a lot of the songs on Sunshine At Midnight. "Good Love" sounds like the beat was created on children's keyboard while "With You Baby" is elementary at best. "My Whole Life" continues the monotonous singing that doomed Sunshine Anderson's first album. Her voice remains mind-numbing on countless songs including "Problems," "Unbelievable" and "Switch It Up," all songs she can be applied to her singing ability (or lack thereof!) The majority of the songs are mundane and dull, with lyrics and vocal presence taking much of the blame. Since there is little to be desired on Sunshine At Midnight, it looks like the sun will be setting on this singer's short-lived musical career.

Rhymefest sounds like a festival for hip-hop artists to gather and showcase their talent. Well, it's actually the name of a Chi-Town rapper who's work with Kanye West helped him land his own contract. Rhymefest helped write "Jesus Walks" with Kanye and hasn't looked back since. He managed to sign a contract with Atlantic Records and was supposed to drop months ago. But after a few delays, Blue Collar is finally available for the world to witness.The project is just as eclectic as the songs on a Kanye West album. From one listen to the first single "Brand New," you immediately realize that this isn't your everyday rapper. True, the chorus can get annoying at times, but "Brand New" does show that Rhymefest can hold his own next to Kanye. The underground hit "Chicago-Rillas" featuring Bump J is a head nod waiting to happen! But the standout singles have to be the hard-hitting "Dynomite" and the raw club joint "Stick" produced by Milwaukee's own Animal House! Rhymefest enlists Kanye West again for the Midwest hustlers' anthem "More" and soul singer Mario for the straight-talk on "All Girls Cheat." Both "Devil's Pie" and "Bullet" featuring Citizen Cope are rough, edgy grooves to rock out to. "Sister" featuring Mike Payne is a smoothed out cut meant for the female listeners. "All I Do" is a depiction of everything that makes Rhymefest who he is. He even has the humorous cut "Build Me Up" with the late, great Ol' Dirty [...]Rhymefest is not to be slept on by any means. He might not be your typical emcee who follows a formula for mass appeal. Instead he focuses on doing what's creative enough to separate him from the flavor of the month (who'll be forgotten by the time the next Top 40 act sprouts up!) This album reminds me of the individuality of College Dropout but without the mega-marketing machine behind it. It makes you wonder why there isn't one in place for Blue Collar.

Rihanna is the new face of Urban Pop. What is Urban Pop? It's been around since the creation of R&B.; Sure, it's had other names you might be more familiar with like Poppy R&B;, Mainstream R&B;, or even Hip-Pop. Whatever you call this sound, it's a formula that's worked for many people, whether it's just for a single track or an entire career. Artists can catch the Urban Pop bug when they want to "crossover" and sell their work to more than just the loyal fan base that's paid the bills for them since day one. Sometimes it can be fatal when you switch up your style just for airplay (look at Ja Rule), but then sometimes it can be profitable too (i.e. Black Eyed Peas). But then you have artists who just simply embrace the format as if it was a separate genre, namely Rihanna. She's hard to place in one category or style of music since she can bust out a power ballad then turn around and do a Caribbean-induced dance track in the same breath. It seems to have worked for her with 2005's Music Of The Sun. Now back again less than a year later with her latest album A Girl Like Me, she further places herself in the ever-growing category of 'OTHER'.The first single "S.O.S." goes straight for the pocketbooks of the mainstream with its reassuring melody. Her power ballads like "Unfaithful," "A Million Miles Away," and "Final Goodbye" go well beyond the regular stuff you'd see on American Idol. The best ballad on the album has to be "P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)" with it's well thought-out lyrics and straightforward delivery. She doesn't run away from the dancehall ditty of her previous smash "Pon De Replay" though. She enlists the help of Sean Paul for "Break It Off," a definite contender to be the next single off the album. She also embraces her Caribbean background for songs like "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," "Dem Haters," "Kisses Don't Lie," and "Selfish Girl." She has some regular, nondescript songs like "A Girl Like Me" and "We Ride" as well.Sure, Rihanna doesn't have any problem grabbing the attention of everybody that listens to popular music. Her looks are non-threatening to industry professionals (and the men and young boys out there certainly aren't complaining either), the pop style that MTV loves, the urban flavor that BET looks for, and the innocence that parents seek out for their daughters to listen to. A Girl Like Me is a sure thing on all levels. Being a native of Barbados, Rihanna has the complete package when it comes to developing her into an international superstar.

Jermaine Dupri deserves a lot of kudos for staying in the game this long. He's managed to build a career that patterns itself after nobody not to mention landing Janet Jackson when others couldn't. That says a lot about a person who used to be a dancer trying to break into the business any way possible. Nobody could have imagined a more distinguished way of establishing a multi-million dollar franchise like he did with So So Def or being Executive V.P. of one of the top music labels in the business. He's launched the careers of Kris Kross, Da Brat, Xscape, and many others with his all-or-nothing attitude. Don't get me wrong...he has some sidesteps from time to time (any album by the Da Brat after Funkdafied, So So Def Bass All Stars, etc). But nothing beats the freefall on his latest effort entitled Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1, a collection of songs from So So Def's past, present, and future artists.Newcomer Young Capone has to be one of the biggest jokes that has ever signed to So So Def. His tales are based on things he only WISHED he had. You can hear his hankering on the first track entitled "I'm Hot" and title track "Young, Fly and Flashy" Dem Franchise Boyz show up on "I Think They Like Me" which meaningless features Da Brat and Bow Wow due to the fact that it sounds just like their horrible breakout single "In My White Tee." Anybody remember K.P. and Envyi? Somehow J.D. mindlessly digs up these wannabes for even more pain and suffering with "Put Cha Hands Up" which sounds like it would have been a B-side to "Shorty Swing My Way." And let's not forget about the laughable song "10 Toes," one of J.D. worst selections of his rapping career. The only listenable track on the whole cd is Jermaine's "Gotta Getcha" and that's barely within acceptable limits.Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1 was meant to not only showcase estblished emcees in the rap game, but also to be the launch pad for So So Def's newer talent to present themselves to the music world. In the end, it probably solidified their fate as fly-by-night artists nobody will ever even remember.

Talk about grinding just to be noticed. Boondox and Kalage of Field Mob have been working hard to make a name for themselves since 2000 when 613: Ashy To Classy dropped and their 2002 follow-up From The Roota To Tha Toota which produced the hit "Sick Of Being Lonely." After some self-evaluation and a little lady luck with the recent collaboration with Ludacris for the smash hit "Georgia," Field Mob is ready to put their best foot forward with their Disturbing The Peace debut Light Poles And Palm Trees.The good thing about Field Mob is that fact that the South is on a huge upswing in popularity thanks to people like Outkast, Paul Wall, Mike Jones, Bun B, Ludacris, Chamillionaire, Dem Franchise Boyz, and countless others. Luckily, they don't sound like anybody mentioned, which sets them apart from anybody out there. They have a underlying comedic tone to their lyrics and sound, but the finished product still comes off as skillfully done and nowhere near primitive. Listening to an album track like "Baby Bend Over" will have you bobbing your head and laughing, but then play the very next track titled "Smilin'" and you'll hear them discuss the hater-ation from people around the way who wish they could be in their shoes. The first single "So What" features Jazze Pha on the boards and Ciara providing the hook, a formula that's been working as far as getting attention and airplay. And after a hilarious skit about Boondox's dark complexion, he offers the reflective track "Blacker The Berry," an inspiring track on what it's like being who he is.Then there are the tracks that just meant to bump at volume 10 in your car stereos like "My Wheels," "1, 2, 3" and "Pistol Grip." Other standouts include the certified summer cut "At The Park," the aforementioned "Georgia," the provocative "Eat Em Up, Beat Em Up," and the mellow track "Sorry Baby" with Bobby Valentino. The only tracks that disrupt the flow include "Area Code 229" with its amateurish outcome, the rock-infused "I Hate You" that they could have done without, and the singing on "It's Over" will have you proclaiming just that in the first 45 seconds of the song! Despite the few blemishes, Field Mob still manages to give us an album worth checking out with Light Poles and Palm Trees.

There really isn't much to say about the O'Jays except that they helped shape R&B soul music over the years to the point where it is a viable and thriving format. The classic tracks from their career are all present on The Essential O'Jays, a 16-song collection that gives you a good snapshot of all their hits. Hits like "Back Stabbers," "Love Train," "Use Ta Be My Girl," "I Love Music," "For The Love Of Money," "Sunshine," "Darlin' Darlin' Baby," "Message In Our Music," "Give The People What They Want," and the ultra smooth "Stairway To Heaven" are all gathered on this disc. There are a few collections out there for the mega superstar singing group, but The Essential O'Jays seems to be the best out of the bunch.

Musiq Soulchild has always been the kind of artist that gets big props and a big push for the lead-off single, but then the label drops the ball for the rest of the album. Let's hope and pray that doesn't happen this time around for Luvanmusiq, the latest effort from Musiq Soulchild. Like always, Musiq drops a monster single titled "B.U.D.D.Y" to take over the airwaves and get the fan base anxious for the album. "Ms. Philly" is a nice ballad, but "Teachme" is a great contender for a follow-up single with its solemn request to be shown how to love a woman the way she wants and needs to be loved. And the most logical song to follow that would be "Betterman," an ode that falls right in line with the same mind-set as "Teachme." Other good songs include the mellow yet direct outlook on love of "Today," the mid-tempo groove "Makeyouhappy," the tender serenade of "Lullaby," and the album closer "Greatestlove" The only songs that don't really do much for the album are the aptly titled track "Ridiculous" with its rather annoying background beat and "Thequestions" because of its plain delivery. But this is, by far, a superb album by Musiq Soulchild for fans to enjoy. Let's hope he can sustain being a top talent in the R&B world with such lackluster promotion. He's a joy to see live, and the songs on Luvanmusiq add to an already impressive resume of great songs from his previous albums.

Remy Ma has been like bubbling water under the heavy lid that has kept her unseen and unheard for the most part. The escape from those confines into the hip-hop world has been a hard one. After seeing her mentor Big Pun die at an early age and during the pinnacle of his career, Remy has been left on the sidelines for years. The infighting between Fat Joe and Cuban Link didn't help matters either. But her presence on the monster hit "Lean Back" help lift that lid right off and put her in the driver's seat to an actual release date. Anybody can have a release date...just ask Charli Baltimore who had two albums that never saw the light of day despite there being release dates. But luckily for Remy, there was enough confidence by the powers that be to actually release There's Something About Remy. And although it isn't as stellar as many would like, the album still has what it takes to please her long-time and newly-acquired fans."She's Gone," "Feels Good" featuring R&B; newcomer Ne-Yo, and "What's Going On" featuring Keyshia Cole are easily the best tracks on this album for future radio cuts. "Whuteva" produced by Swizz Beats was a decent choice for the first single, but the followup song "Conceited" produced by Scott Storch was only mediocre at best. Even though "Thug Love" is comical, it does feel good to hear lyrics from the late great Big Pun again. "I'm" is another decent mix of the Dirty South flavor with an East Coast sound. "Crazy" is another radio-friendly contender with an old school sample as the backdrop. And "Still" serves as a retrospect of Remy's life leading up to today.Regrettably, trashy tracks make their way on Remy Ma's debut album. "Lights, Camera, Action" will have you running for the mute button, the 'next track' button, or the power button immediately. "Bilingual" featuring Ivy Queen is the latest failed attempt at trying to add another lingo in an already wack rap song. "Guilty" is too short (clocking in at 1:59....should this have been an interlude?), "Tight" with the annoying Fat Joe is practically self-explanatory, and "Secret Location" needed a little more perfecting in the production area.Although there aren't many female emcees in the game anymore, Remy Ma still lacks the total package of the greats that have come before her. Maybe leaving Terror Squad and getting with a more diverse arrangement of mega-producers like Dr. Dre, Kanye West, or Jermaine Dupri would solve some of her problems. But all in all, There's Something About Remy isn't a total failure and could be enjoyed by those who like her previous work. As far as her career though, relying on the leadership of Fat Joe could leave Remy on the Rocks

When you watch American Hustle, get ready for an experience like now other. American Hustle is a meshing of a cinematic intro with the side-splitting comedy of Katt Williams and company. The feature starts with Katt getting ready for a important Hollywood meeting to discuss movie possibilities starring the up-and-coming superstar. He ultimately passes on the ridiculous movie pitches and ventures out back on the road with fellow comics Red, Luenell, and Melanie Camacho. The four comics and Katt's dog hit the road for 20-city, 40-show tour that eventually culminates to the final show in Chicago. And it is at this point that viewers are treated to the feature-length concert footage of Katt Williams. The DVD closes with Katt Williams sharing the stage and the mic with Chi-Town's ownDa Bratand everybody's favorite honorary pimpSnoop Dogg.Packaged as a theatrical comedy, American Hustle evolves mostly around Katt's stand-up, a routine that can basically be deemed Pimp Chronicles 2. The material is original and will have you laughing out loud. Although we are treated to a handful of stand-up scenes from Red, Luenell, and Melanie, it would have been nice to actually see more of their routine, if not their entire sets. But the material that we are treated to is nothing short of hilarious, with Luenell giving the funniest anecdotes of the three. And of course Katt's spin on life, love, and relationships is on par with everything else that the budding star has showcased, including its predecessorThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1. With extended footage of the skit 'Brokebeak Penguins', and his spoof on the movie 300, and about a dozen outtakes, this DVD is unique in its presentation and captures the ingenious comedic styling of Katt Williams. Any fan of Katt Williams will not be disappointed with American Hustle.

R&B; is already a super competitive market, although some music industry analysts would probably disagree with that statement. The list is endless when you think about all the soul artists that tried to even catch a break or those that managed to get one or two hit singles only to have lackluster sales and dropped from their labels. That's one thing that I love about Hidden Beach Recordings. Their whole focus is to get the word out about new artists and actually build a career instead of looking for somebody with one hot song that will generate millions of dollars in revenue for the company. From Jill Scott to Lina to the Unwrapped collections, Hidden Beach has done an outstanding job of actually standing behind the careers of their artists. Thus is the case for Kindred, a husband-and-wife team who had modest success with their debut album Surrender To Love with the hit song "Far Away" and the modest success of the second single "Stars." An expansion of the style of music they introduced on their first album, the dynamic duo returns with the album In This Life Together.The group has a knack for making some of the best 'Grown and Sexy' music there is to enjoy out here. "Thru Love" is a great example of the quality that Aja and Fatin have put in their body of work. Another classic couple song entitled "In This Life Together" has Aja and Fatin trading verses on how much the other has meant to them. "Woman First" is a good song from Aja for any lady out there that doesn't know her worth in the world to embrace. "Where Would I Be" is the first single from the album, and begs the question that many couples ask themselves from time to time. "As Of Yet" is a song that reflects on the goals that everybody wishes to attain one day. This sentiment continues on "Struggle No More" with the help of Grammy Award-winning artist India.Arie and the introspective song "Who's Gonna Comfort You."But Kindred has other elements to their style besides those mentioned previously. "Message To Marvin" is sort of like the 2005 version of Marvin Gaye's "What's Goin' On" and "Mercy, Mercy Me" with an emphasis on relaying to the late R&B; crooner that things haven't changed at all since the recording of his song. From being carted off to a worthless war to the silly shenanigans that we see all the time with celebrities and people on the streets, "Message To Marvin" is a song that needs to be heard by the masses. They also change up and do more entertaining songs like "Turn It Up" with rapper Archie Eversoul and the hilarious "Sneak A Freak" where they tell a story of having to creep around just to get a little nookie after putting the kids to bed!The rest of the album has conventional Kindred songs that most will tie closely with Surrender To Love, like "Do You Remember," "Let It All Go," and "My Time" where they include their children towards the end of the disc. But by no means are these below average songs, but rather the sound we are more accustom to hearing from Aja and Fatin. Hopefully In This Life Together will prove to be a breakout album for a group that is most deserving of everybody's attention. And if you ever get a chance to see Kindred in concert like my wife and I did two years ago, you're in for a real treat...but be sure to go with a significant other to get the whole experience.

Bad Boy is going for the trifecta this year. With the recent release of the concocted (yet chart-topping) girl group Danity Kane as well as the next Diddy album coming in October, the trio will be complete. But the buzz for Bad Boy all started with Cassie. After generating months of publicity on the internet, "Me and U" was a certified smash hit when it finally made it to radio and video playlists everywhere. Now all Cassie and her personal producer Ryan Leslie had to do is grind out an album that builds on the success of the leading single. With Bad Boy as the vehicle, Cassie released her self-titled album for the masses to consume and enjoy.Did I mention that "Me and U" was all over the airwaves? If you never heard that song, then you really have been living under a rock. Other songs on here that have potential to be radio cuts include the rhythmic bounce on "About Time" as well as the edgy "Long Way 2 Go." Ryan Leslie creeps onto songs like "Kiss Me" and "Just One Nite" but does little to help either song since they lack any quality production or lyrics. "Call U Out" is monotonous in its delivery, "What Do U Want" sounds like a reject Pussycat Dolls track, and "Ditto" just sounds horrific.But the saddest thing about the album itself is that it only clocks in at a little over 35 minutes! Shouldn't this disc be marketed as an EP and not an LP? Anyways, Cassie does show some promise though. Her singing ability isn't any worse than these other fly-by-night artists that have popped up in recent years. But she better do a lot better the next time out, or she could find herself being labeled a one-hit wonder too!

Miri Ben Ari is probably the hottest hip hop element of the last five years. She has been featured on so much stuff, you probably couldn't count it all. Most recently she was featured on almost all of Kanye West's "College Dropout." If you ever heard a violin in the background, nine times out of ten it was probably the work of Miri Ben Ari. Originally from Israel, Miri has been able to mesh well with the hip-hop sound using her string instrument of choice. Before she made it big, she was looked at as a novelty of sorts. But Miri is trying to make a name for herself, and the name that she chose was The Hip-Hop Violinist, which happens to be the same name she uses for her debut rap album.No, don't get it twisted. Miri Ben Ari isn't dropping lyrics over her violin playing. This is a compilation mainly focusing on her musical craft and incorporating different singers and emcees in the business, most of which she has already worked with in the past. Her good friend Kanye represents alongside Fabolous and R&B; singer Musiq on the song "Fly Away," a great choice for a future radio single. Jadakiss represents on the album's first cut "We Gonna Win" and Akon does his thing further into the disc on "Miss Melody." "Jump & Spread Out" features the hype man of the millenium Fat Man Scoop along with reggae flavor from Vicious (whether is Lil Vicious of "Nikki" fame, I have no idea). Doug E. Fresh is on the album (who had a song with Lil Vicious called "Freaks" but that proves nothing), and he brings his beat-box skills on the new school version of the "Star Spangled Banner."Pharoahe Monch returns from oblivion with "New World Symphony," and Scarface resurfaces in a collaboration with Anthony Hamilton for the first single "Sunshine To The Rain." Anthony Hamilton is featured for a second time on the song "She Was Just A Friend" along with an R&B; newcomer named Algebra. John Legend is accompanied by Consequence of "College Dropout" fame with the song "I've Been Waiting On You." The only songs that aren't the best are Lil Mo's "Hold Your Head Up High," and "4 Flat Tires" featuring Baby and Lil Wayne of Cash Money. Miri does have one song entitled "Chillin' in the Key of E" that she does by herself, but really isn't much to listen to. And the album closes with a remix of "Jump & Spread Out" with Fatman Scoop at the helm again as well as Pitbull and two unknowns named Zion and Lennox.Miri Ben Ari will probably be overlooked by many, but honestly has one heck of a good compilation on her hands. Think of The Hip-Hop Violinist as the soundtrack to the streets with a little classical twist to it. Everybody is always requesting something fresh and new to listen too. But when something like that hits the market like Miri Ben Ari's disc, everybody seems to be reluctant to go the extra mile and actually check out something different! Do yourself a favor and sample some of the tracks for yourself on Amazon.com and see for yourself if it's something you can get into. Or go back to listening to your same ole manufactured rap albums you're probably on the verge of shelving any minute now.

If you were Letoya Luckett, you'd probably think that debuting number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart would be sweet revenge. Revenge? Yeah, for all the mess you had to endure from being treated like dirt and dropped from the biggest girl group of the decade. And for what? Being upset with the way management was "managing" the group? Normally that wouldn't be a big deal, but it is when management is the father of the the lead singer. So maybe she should have followed the Rock's advice by knowing her role and shutting her mouth. But when you look and sing as good as the lead singer, it's bound to irk your nerve eventually. Now that her solo career is soaring, a part of Letoya is probably relieved that she doesn't have to say goodbye to her singing career just yet. And things look very promising with her debut album Letoya getting a lot of good publicity.She starts off the album with "U Got What I Need," a teen pleaser that fuses Hip-Hop elements with her R&B; vocals. "So Special" follows that same formula, only using a more pounding beat for the background. "Torn" is her monster song that commanded the singles charts and video playlists for weeks before the album's release. Letoya goes with a more adult sound on "What Love Can Do" and "She Don't." Jazze Pha brings his signature sound while Bun B provides a rap verse for "Tear Da Club Up." She stumbles a little with "All Eyes On Me" even with the help of Paul Wall. Letoya makes up for it with the banger "Hey Fella" with Slim Thug. She satisfies the chopped and screwed crowd for her hometown fans with "Gangsta Grillz" featuring Mike Jones and Killa Kyleon. She slows it down for a bit with a huge ballad titled "Obvious," a song that proves she can please multiple tastes. Then Letoya switches to the teen-friendly, mid-tempo track "I'm Good" with a sound similar to what you would find on older Destiny's Child albums. She slows it down again for the Jermaine Dupri-assisted "This Song." She closes out the album with an okay yet pointless remix of "Torn" with Rick Ross and Mike Jones.Even though the young adult crowd will enjoy this album a lot more than the 'Grown and Sexy' people, it doesn't make Letoya any less worthy of superstardom than anyone else out here. And with early buzz about Beyonce' album B-Day being a bust, maybe the success of Letoya will help her reach the top sooner rather than later.

This is an artist to watch for sure. She's got that spunk...that fire that we need to hear in today's artists. You surely can tell she's got the skills with songs like her debut single "Music" when she asks "Where's the music gone?" That's exactly what I've been saying for quite some time now. Leela is the crown jewel when it comes to real SOUL music. I know people love tossing that "Neo-Soul" phrase around, but Leela goes back to basics on this one. She has that down home feel about her music. She puts you in the vein of Syleena Johnson and Joss Stone, but she still manages to distinguish herself enough where you won't mistake her for anyone else.. Songs like "Good Time" will set your weekend off right when your running to your car at 5pm on Fridays. Remakes are both surprising and interesting with the title track done remarkably well compared to Sam Cooke's original and "Don't Speak" is sung so well you forget that it was one of No Doubt's signature songs. But even her OWN songs are a cut above the rest. "Ghetto" with Wyclef shows that she don't take no mess, "Prayer" gives homage to the Lord, and "Mistreating Me" displays the strength of loving oneself. We can only hope that a change will come within the music world when this songstress gets the attention she ought to have.

Talk about a man with nothing to prove. He's known the world over with his talents in songwriting, producing, and singing. But don't think he's slowing down for one second because Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds has the staying power of all that have managed to stick around for countless years. Even when he was with The Deele, Babyface's voice stood out so far, it was never a question of if he would break out on his own but rather when! With a resume that few can match in the past quarter century, Babyface could easily retire and let the young folks take over. But it's not always easy for these newcomers to appeal to everybody, especially those with more mature attitudes when it comes to music. And these very same people don't want to necessarily listen to the music of artists that their parents grew up with. Enter Grown and Sexy, an album more suited for those individuals around the age of 25 to 39 who want more than the crop of hip-hop tinged R&B; that has dominated the airwaves but don't necessarily want to switch to the oldies channel either.Babyface starts out the album with "Tonight It's Going Down," a stepper's groove that is sure to get the party going. Babyface brings elements of the old and blends them with the new on "Grown And Sexy," a good anthem for those of us within that age range. He keeps the mood going with "Mad Sexy Cool," "Can't Stop Now," and "Good To Be In Love" with a less serious approach on talking about relationships. It's not like Babyface has to really jump into a new format or change his style in order to reach this ever-growing audience. Songs like "God Must Love U," "Drama, Love and 'Lationships," and "Going Outta Business" are simply classic Babyface material that happens to fit the mold. The first single "Sorry For The Stupid Things" is another song that applies to more than a certain age group, and "Loneliness" was a good leftover track from the shelved album A Love Story.If you are looking for an album that is more sophisticated yet still fun, then this is the album for you. There aren't many things bad about the album, but I can see how some past fans might feel like he's conforming to another sound rather than sticking to his core. But sometimes change is good, even if it looks like the wrong move at the time. Hopefully Babyface can prove to his longstanding fans that his album is still worthy of their money. And maybe more people will listen to Grown And Sexy and recognize that there is a crowd out there that is overlooked when it comes to radio programming, video playlists, and concerts.

Ralph Tresvant has certainly had his share of ups and downs in his career as a member of New Edition. Although his solo career started off okay like his NE counterparts with his self-title album Ralph Tresvant, the release of It's Goin' Down was the perfect title for what his solo career would ultimately do. He would return with the group for the marginally successful Home Again album and the not-so-successful One Love. Needing a break from all the bureaucracy, Ralph re-ups and goes solo once again with the independent release of Rizz Wa Faire. Although not as bad as It's Goin' Down, it's definitely room for improvement.There are a few gems on this album that will have most Tresvant fans happy. "Man Who Loves You" is a definite jam reminiscent of the early solo stuff on Ralph Tresvant. Other songs like the smooth "Save A Little Love," the suaveness of "Too Cool," the contagious "Never Noticed," and the bangin' first single "My Homegirl" are all knockout tracks for Ralph. Decent cuts include "Love Hangover," "Don't Act Innocent," and "Better Man." Doesn't sound like a bad album, does it? Not so fast!"Magic Underwear" sounds just as ridiculous as its title. Shall I continue? The questionable production on "Jungle Club" or "Strange Emotions" will leave you confused to say the least. The rushed delivery and equally mind-numbing lyrics on "Angel." There's also the ever-so-dated "Something To Give U" and the overproduced song "Another Shot." Ralph Tresvant didn't do his best with Rizz Wa Faire, and it seems he had the potential to actually have a supreme album this time out. But with little artistic direction and a mountain of bad choices, Rizz Wa Faire is only good enough to purchase in used bin at best.

It's almost unbelievable that Luther Vandross is gone. He is probably the single reason a lot of today's R&B; crooners are even in the business. His stage presence...his lyrics...his voice were unmistakable. All this from a man who reportedly never wanted to be a solo artist to begin with. He, like a lot of background singers, was encouraged to step out on faith and pursue an R&B; singing career. Decades later, the man who we all loved as a singer and as a person left this world of ours and left behind a legacy that rivals the best that ever did it. So for anyone to come up with a collection of songs sung by today's hottest artists to commemorate the man and his music was a no brainer. Although there are two other Jazz tributes to Luther, So Amazing: An All-Star Tribute To Luther Vandross is the first collaboration to feature almost exclusively R&B; acts. But anybody who is a die-hard Luther fan actually might not like some of the stuff on this album.Don't get me wrong...there are plenty of good renditions on this collection. Mary J. Blige kicks off the cd with a fun rendition of "Never Too Much" and Usher gives a knockout performance of "Superstar," but then Fantasia sings a gospel-tinged version of "Til My Baby Comes Home" that sounds she tried to sing a little too hard. Beyonce and Stevie Wonder give their spin on the title track, but Aretha Franklin only sounds okay singing the classic "A House Is Not A Home." Following that is Donna Summer with probably one of the most disturbing songs on the album, namely the techno/dance version of the song "Power of Love." Then there is the surprisingly mediocre rendition of "If This World Were Mine" by Alicia Keys featuring Jermaine Paul. Another surprise is the decent duet on "Anyone Who Had A Heart" with the voice of Luther Vandross alongside Elton John who sings his part of the song so exceptionally well, it's almost a shame it wasn't originally recorded this way.The second half of the disc doesn't start off too well, with Celine Dion's sub-par attempt at singing "Dance With My Father." The silliness continues with Wyclef Jean trying to sing "Always And Forever" and quite obviously failing miserably at it. Things thankfully pick up with Babyface's signature style brought on the song "If Only For One Night" and Patti Labelle representing to the fullest on "Here And Now." My boy John Legend rocks "Love Won't Let Me Wait," the Major Harris-turned-Luther classic that John sings as if it's his own classic! The album closes out with a good version of "Since I Lost My Baby" by Angie Stone and a respectable take on "Creepin" by Jaime Foxx.All in all, So Amazing is not a bad collection for the moderate Luther fans who can actually tolerate others singing Luther classics. It all depends on whether you think it's acceptable for people to redo Luther songs or leave well enough alone. I myself don't have a problem with artists doing classic material from another person's collection, but you better bring it or else you could tick off a lot of that person's fans...the very people you are singing the songs for in the first place!

Dj Clue has always been able to get the best of the best for his hip-hop 'mixtapes' despite the fact that he offers nothing more than his signature 'yells' for each of the songs. The Professional, Pt. 3 is no different than any of the previous installments that he's put out. Collabos are abundant, like the pairing of Lil Wayne's with Rick Ross and Ransom for "Clear The Scene," the Philadelphia trio of Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Cassidy on "Liberty Bell," The Game and Mario Winans for both parts of "A Week Ago," and the obvious left-over track "You Don't Really Wanna" from Fat Joe and former Terror Squad member Remy Ma. But the one collaboration that will have you doing a double take is the Fabulous and Jagged Edge song "I Really Wanna Know," a song that basically covers Jodeci's classic ballad "Come And Talk To Me." Some good solo shots include Mobb Deep's "The Gold," "Da Boss" by Fabolous, and a resurfacing M.O.P. on "Giantz of NY." Some low moments are Snoop Dogg's "Almost F*cked," Young Jeezy and Juelz Santana's "F*ck Off," "Grill And Woman" from Mike Jones and Paul Wall, and a lackluster showing from The Lox with Jadakiss' "Ugly (Thug It Out)" and Styles P's "The Animal." Dj Clue has lost a lot of steam as far as sales goes, probably a direct result of the over-saturation of 'mixtapes' by fly-by-night deejays. But since Dj Clue started off that way, he knows he has to come correct with his own projects. And even though The Professional, Pt. 3 is not the best, it most certainly isn't the worst mixtape out here either.

Adults Only is supposedly the last time we'll hear a solo album from the R&B; veteran according to Aaron's statement on the introduction of his latest album. For a man that was THE voice of the mega R&B; group Guy for many years and two previous solo efforts, this has been a long winding road to travel. He's influenced many of the balladeers that would come after him, hearing major influences in the group Jodeci and today's top soul singer R. Kelly. The Nasty Man has done it all, but there is one thing that Aaron Hall failed to recognize...he lost his appeal years ago!Don't get me wrong, he's got enough talent left to annihilate some of today's unpolished singers. But as far as being a stand alone artist, he never really got a grasp of who he should be as a solo artist. Sure, he had a few good songs on his last two solo albums. "I Miss You" and "Don't Be Afraid" (although not the original version) were big hits from his first album, do you remember any other songs besides the modest hit "Get A Little Freaky With Me" from that album? And let's not forget his second album Inside of You barely made a blip on the map. Besides "All The Places" and "If You Leave Me" featuring Faith Evans, what else stood out from the album? Not much. The same is true with Adults Only, with only a few songs even being half decent. It seems he's given up and decided to sound exactly like the Pied Piper in order to generate any buzz.It's bad enough the album is independently released by Head Start Records, but Aaron goes the extra mile to sound like material R Kelly would put on his album. The "Oooh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah" on the song "Sorry" sounds just like when R Kelly borrowed the "Oooh, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah" for his song. "Sorry" uses the "telephone" voice that countless people have ripped, and "Perfect Woman" references names of people like Halle, J-Lo, and Janet Jackson. "Video" is almost exactly what R Kelly would do, and in real life has done! But even songs that don't appear to be influenced by the competition don't gel well with Aaron's "style" of singing. "Stamina," "Your," and "Serve That Body" make Aaron sound nothing short of ridiculous. It's almost a blessing this is the last album for Aaron, but what's next for the Nasty Man? Mickey D's?

Rick James used to call her "Sapphire." That's what Teena Marie said when she was asked recently about where the title of the new album came from. This might be a good depiction of the longtime songstress considering her bluesy sound that can match anyone in the business today. Teena Marie's singing ability is a rarity to say the least, and her music stands the test of time much like the precious gem itself. Classics like "Ooo La La La" and "Fire and Desire" still make their way onto the late night Urban radio shows. Other hits like "Square Biz," "Lovergirl," and "Out On A Limb" solidified her as the real deal. Her latest effort Sapphire showcases her pure talent even more, giving her one of the most complete albums of her career.Her smooth cuts like the first single "Ooo Wee" and "Cruise Control" will quiet most naysayers who say she can't possibly still have it. "Sleeping With The Enemy," "Romantica," and "The Way You Love Me" embody her traditional sound that most fans can related to. Sultry songs like "A.P.B." and "Ecstacy" are on point, but her unofficial tribute to Rick James titled "You Blow Me Away" is the true gem of the album. Teena Marie does step out of her comfort zone and tries her hand at some mid-tempo songs as well. The better tracks include "Baby, Who's Is It" with Kurupt, and "Make It Hot," while "Ladies Choice" and "Simmer Down" are only okay at best.She saves a tribute for the hurricane victims in the Gulf Coast for the end of the disc. The song is titled "Resilient (Sapphire)" and it pairs Teena Marie with her teenage daughter Alia Rose for what turns out to be a quite impressive duet for a mother-daughter team. I guess it's safe to say that Teena Marie pulls out all the stops with this one. Thankfully, she didn't have to resort to any of her Cash Money labelmates for help. Any true fan of old school music or Teena Marie should be pleasantly pleased with Sapphire.

Touted as one of the early alternatives to the West Coast in the 90s, The Alkaholiks only managed to gain a little fame throughout the many years they've been around. Early hits like "Make Room" and "Hip Hop Drunkies" with ODB made a little noise, but for the most part the Alkaholiks remained under the mainstream radar. They came on the scene 15 years ago and managed to have a decent fan base to follow them the whole way. J-Ro, Tash, and E-Swift muster up enough nerve to put out what they say is their last album together. Although it's a little different from their previous efforts, Firewater will have most of their fans lifting their bottles in salute.The Liks don't change up their flow at all, sticking to basic metaphors and head-nodding beats. "Party Ya @ss Off" is probably the most comparable song to others in their long resume of tracks. "Get Into It" "Chaos" and "Turn It Up" will also keep hardcore fans happy. "Do It" has a grimy feel even though it does have a little bit of a mainstream sound to it with a similar riff to Missy Elliot's "Sock It To Me." "The Flute Song (LaLaLa)" is their radio-friendly cut while "Over Here" is probably the most impressive underground cut. "Popular Demand" is a horn-blaring anthem that is a great intro song to a Liks stage show. "On The Floor" and "The Get Down" have an East Coast feel, putting you in the mind of Mobb Deep but with faster lyrics.There are some songs that will give a few fans something to question. "Poverty's Paradise" is a very deep and soul-driven reflection of the hoods in America, something nobody expects to hear coming the Liks. "Handle It" suffers from a sub par beat along with bland lyrics. "Hangover" is the title most fans have been waiting for, but it comes off sounding too commercial and clich&eacute;. "Drink Wit Us" starts off like a homage to BDP's song "Number 1," but then loses its steam soon after.Firewater does quench the thirst of day one fans, but won't garner any awards or accolades from today's hip-hop crowds. Essentially, that's the best thing about the Alkaholiks. They've pretty much stayed true to their sound and their audience throughout their entire career. That's something that very few rappers these days know anything about. Hopefully they have enough experience to go on to bigger and better things. The Liks have paid their tab consistently and are well deserving of a 21-can salute!

Okay, I know this isn't exactly R&B;, but hear me out on this one. There has been an ongoing craze the past couple of years with jazz covers of today's popular music. The two biggest names that are behind this fascination are Hidden Beach Recordings and Streetwize. They both basically do the same thing... cover popular songs by R&B; and Hip-Hop artists. There are some that do a collection of songs from different artists on one disc, while other albums focus on the catalog of one particular artist.Streetwize Does Dre showcases some great jazz reworkings of songs produced by Dr. Dre. The list includes Dr. Dre's own "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang," "Xxplosive," and "Forgot About Dre," as well as 2pac's "California Love," Snoop Dogg's "Gin and Juice," "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" by Eve and Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige's "Not Today," The Game's "How We Do," and "My Name Is" by Eminem. This is a good disc to play while you're unwinding from a long day at work or when you're forced to spend the weekend hosting a backyard barbeque with the in-laws and all those other family members you'd rather not be around. But don't worry, the Streetwize crew aren't dumb enough to include the curse words in the songs, so it's safe to play around the kiddies as well!

Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth never had a lot of commercial success, but one thing can be said about them: they stayed true to the game. Putting out quality material throughout the 90s, the duo epitomized the sound of East Coast music for many hip-hop heads. Putting out classics like "They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)," "I Got A Love," "Lots Of Lovin'" "Take You There," "Mecca And The Soul Brother," "One In A Million," and "Straighten It Out," The Best of Pete Rock and C. L. Smooth delivers both the commercially-released hits and the album track gems that most of their fans have come to love. Many die hard fans already have everything on this disc. But for those youngsters who are just learning about the group, The Best of Pete Rock and C. L. Smooth gives you a good overview of their best selections.

Lina is arguably the most unique soul singer to hit the scene in recent memory. Just ask the few people that even know who she is and they will tell you the same thing. But no matter if you are familiar with Lina or not, everybody should become more acquainted with her latest album The Inner Beauty Movement. After struggling to get any kind of spotlight in 2001 with Stranger On Earth, Lina jumps from Atlantic Records to Hidden Beach and released The Inner Beauty Movement with a little more clear sound unlike her earlier album. Although some might think she is too far out there, Lina actually mixes a little bit of old school with her new school ideology to give her sound that distinctive edge few others can manage to come up with.With 3 interludes and 15 solid tracks, Lina channels the spirits of people like Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz singers along with the flavor of recent soul stirrers like Amel Larrieux and Jazzyfatnastees on her collection of eclectic material. However, don't confuse her music with any definite sound as Lina brings her own concocted brew to the potluck that is the music industry. A couple great tracks that proves this point are the subtle yet authoritative "Leaving You," the equally sophisticated "Hope, Wish & Pray" and late night groove "Smooth." Anthony Hamilton shares a tune with Lina on "Around The World" where they both show off their harmonic abilities. More revitalizing music can be found on "Peace And Love" and "I Am," while more jazzier melodies are present on songs like "It Could Be," "On My Own," and "My Fix."Lina will have a tough time getting the younger crowd to sit down and enjoy an album like this. This is more for the coffee shops and lounges that us older folks are more familiar with. The Inner Beauty Movement will probably be slept on by the masses, but anybody reading this review is more than likely open to something different in their collection. If this describes yourself, then The Inner Beauty Movement is unquestionably your most ideal selection.

We finally have it. After many years of waiting and anticipating, Mos Def has finally blessed us with a new album to follow-upBlack on Both Sidesand the strange offeringThe New Danger. Many fans were thrown off by The New Danger with its rock and blues influences throughout. True Magic is definitely a unique monster all its own (if you look at the picture, you will notice that the cd has no artwork or liner notes...it's just the disc!) After listening to True Magic, you will see that Mos Def is more about having fun with music nowadays than trying to prove a point. A lot of people will probably listen and think the songs sound rushed, but it seems to be more carefree and loose like an organized promo cd or mixtape. Even though most of the songs have that same feel, the standouts on here have to be "Crime And Medicine" (which borrow's the beat and melody fromGZA's "Liquid Sword"), "Dollar Day (a melodic yet political battle cry about the whole Hurricane Katrina fiasco rapped over the beat fromJuvenile's "Nolia Clap"), and "Lifetime" (an airy serenade reminiscent of "Umi Says" from Black On Both Sides). Other notables is the simple uplifting chants on "There Is A Way," the underground hip-hop feel of "Undeniable," and the analytical and accurate depiction of the mentality in the streets on "Fake Bonanza." There are some tracks that are more like extended interludes and aren't really tracks at all. So anybody that is a true die-hard fan of Mos Def will enjoy this album. Others who simply jumped on the bandwagon when "Umi Says" blew up and aren't really into Mos like that will still look at this as if it's The New Danger or something. Let's just hope True Magic is just a teaser, and there's really a more complete album on the way.

Listening to Shareefa's album was certainly an eye-opening experience. From the opening tracks of Point of No Return, you get a sense that Shareefa has had her fair share of bad times. The introduction has her behind bars, swearing that she's gonna right the wrong that has happened. To the casual R&B; listener, this is a little bit jarring but certainly doesn't demonstrate her ability as a singer.So leading right into the first track "Cry No More," you immediately feel compelled to compare her to the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. The raw, gritty voice of Shareefa will appeal mostly to those who haven't grown up with old school R&B.; She hits most of the notes but misses others completely. This continues on "Need A Boss" featuring Ludacris, a song that also suffers from production is entirely too experimental. Again on "No One Said," her voice struggles to stay in a comfort zone and finds its way into the dangerous territory of "cringing." "Butterfly" is a wonderfully written song that could have been better if Faith Evans or Syleena Johnson were singing it. This same problem occurs on "How Good Luv Feels," a song that has the potential but lacks the polished feel that it certainly needs. There are other songs where the background singers carry the song, namely "Trippin" and "Eye Wonder." But some tracks like the ill-fated "Phony" and "Fevah" shouldn't have seen the light of day. The duet with Bobby Valentino for "Hey Babe" is only okay and does little for the album in general.Some have argued that Mary J. Blige was raw and street when she first hit the music world. And I would agree 100% with those people. But Mary has since improved drastically from her humble beginnings and amassed a worldwide listening audience that loves and respects everything she puts out. So to totally dismiss Shareefa after one album would be unfair and biased. But one thing is for sure....she's got a lot of work ahead of her if she wants to be the next MJB. And after listening to Point of No Return, that's clearly the person Shareefa's trying to be like. But so is Keyshia Cole, Lil Mo, and others...so you can't really knock her for trying.

Talk about a man that has nothing to prove. He didn't seek to set trends, keep other artists on their toes, or lay the blueprint for having a long-term career. All of those things were the result of Prince's one main goal in life....make good music. Some may argue that Prince has had his fair share of weak albums. But don't dare try to tell that to the multitude of die hard fans out that that continue to buy EVERY album and sell out countless concerts almost 30 years since his emergence into the music industry. After building momentum with his last couple releases, Prince mixes all of his styles together and pushes further away from the norm with his new album 3121.Critiquing a Prince album is just as delicate a procedure as reviewing other limitless artists like Outkast and Miles Davis. For example, Prince jams out on the funk-infused "Love," but then he does a 180-degree turn on the very next track with the sultry and equally melodious slow jam "Satisfied." The title track "3121" is about as far-reaching and varied as Prince has ever been. With a synthesized voice layered over his regular tone coupled with a techno-laced funk groove and live instrumentation, this is arguably a sample of what the future of music will be. He continues along those same lines with "Lolita" but focuses on lyrics more than he does on "3121."Those wanting more distinguishing sounds from Prince will find their fix of slow songs with "Incense and Candles" and "The Dance" as well as the up tempo jams like "Black Sweat" and "The Fury." "Te Amo Corazon" gives a little Latin flair to his traditional smooth sounds, "Get On The Boat" is another funked out party cut, and "Beautiful, Loved and Blessed" is a radio-friendly cut sung with his prot?g? Ta'Mar. If this isn't proof that Prince is back better than ever, I don't know what is. 3121 is unwavering, refreshing, and a clear statement to all that ever doubted Prince's ability to maintain relevant in an ever-changing music landscape.

They say the best work by a musician is when they've gone through something. Sometimes it's from the birth of a child or a life-changing event, but most times it's from heartache. It's evident that India.Arie has gone through something in the past four years since her last album Voyage To India. When your album is called Testimony: Vol. 1, Life and Relationship, it's obvious it's not about the 'Little Things' anymore. You apparently have some stuff to get off your chest and "testify" about to the world. Such is the case with India.Arie's latest effort, but thankfully Testimony isn't all about pain and suffering.She opens with a prayer to God, then lays it on the line with the heart-wrenching song "These Eyes" that explain her obviously painful attempt to move on without the love of her life. She continues on those same lines with a cover of Don Henley's "Heart Of The Matter" and "Good Morning." Other tracks like the self-reflecting "India's Song" and the sympathetic words on "Wings of Forgiveness" completes the circle of getting back to where she was before the heartache. She then switches gears and serves up a fun song called "Private Party" that shows that it's okay to embrace one's self and that it's important to love yourself first. "There's Hope" is a uplifting sonnet about learning that there's always light at the end of the tunnel. "Summer" with country music's Rascal Flatts and jazz musician Victor Wooten is one of the most interesting 'fusion' tracks around. Akon makes an appearance on the revamped "I Am Not My Hair," a newer version from the radio single that surfaced months ago.India.Arie closes out the album with the upbeat "Better People" and the funky flamboyance of "I Choose." Anybody that simply considers Testimony as just another album by India.Arie have certainly not listened to the growth and maturity that she's had since her first song "Video" dropped back in 2001. India.Arie has definitely outdone herself this time, giving us a fresh look of what it means to be a human being with real emotions and real outlooks on life.

Having been away from the NBA floor for some years now, Wayman Tisdale continues on with the other love of his life...music. He's chalked up one successful album after another in his musical career. His first album Power Forward was well received, along with his follow-ups In The Zone, Decisions, and his chart-topping album Face To Face in 2001. After being drafted to Rendezvous Records by the label's founder Dave Koz, Tisdale released 2004's Hang Time. Now Tisdale presents the jazz world with some of his best work to date with Way Up. Working with well-known singers and musicians in the industry gives Tisdale the all-star power that other contemporary jazz artists can only dream of having on their team.Wayman's best work has to be a cover of Kool And The Gang's "Get Down On It." One of my favorites on the album include my hometown hero Eric Benet showcasing his signature crooning on "Sweet Dreams." Jeff Lorber helps out on the tracks "It Was A Good Day" with Tom Braxton and "Shape Of Your Heart." Kirk Whalum does double duty with his saxaphone for a cover of Sly and the Family Stone's "If You Want Me To Stay" in addition to joining up with Jonathan Butler to offer up their best for "Sunday's Best." George Duke lends a hand on "Tell It Like It Is" while Bob James makes his rounds on "Conversation Peace." And of course Wayman shows off on "My Son (song for Bubba)" with help from his commander-in-chief Dave Koz.Way Up is one of those albums that just do it for you. It's not your typical jazz album that is just good the first time you hear it. Way Up will definitely stand the test of time when you play it for the 100th time 2 years from now. Wayman Tisdale was a standout NBA player back in the day, but now he's a standout bass player making a name for himself in a whole new arena.

Joe has been around the block enough times to know what it takes to put together a solid R&B album. A lot of artists come and go in the music industry because they didn't have the promotional machine behind their albums. Joe has fallen victim to this very same situation, suffering from a lack of sales even though his albums have great songwriting and are well produced. But the son of a preacher man (and preacher woman) continues to push on because of his love for the music. His latest project is Ain't Nothin' Like Me, another banging R&B album on his long list of hot albums. His focus on ballads is obvious, probably since more fans recognize him for his smooth vocals. Songs like "If I Was Your Man" and "I Want Her" are huge standouts that are primed for radio. "My Love" is another contender for a future single with its underlying danceable beat, along with the poetic "It's Me" where he apologizes for stepping out on a relationship. Surprisingly, his song with Nas titled "Get To Know Me" and another with Papoose called "Where You At" are still slow cuts even with the inclusion of the respective rappers. Other songs with a touch of Hip-Hop are stepped up to a mid-tempo groove, namely "Let's Just Do It" with the incognito lyricist Fabolous, the title track with Tony Yayo and Young Buck, and "Just Relax" with Dre (of Cool & Dre.) If you're a long-time fan of Joe, you will certainly enjoy Ain't Nothin' Like Me. The album title says it all.

No longer subject to the non-promoting Bad Boy label, Carl Thomas does a major re-up with his adequately titled new cd So Much Better. You are immediately seduced by the intro track "If I Could," leaving you wishing that it was a full-length song. "Another You (Steppers Mix)" is a nice mid-tempo cut suitable for the intimate lounge crowd. "2 Pieces" is just as danceable, with a heavy drum kick and smoothed-out lyrics. "Thought You Should Know" is the hands-down standout featuring the sweet songbird Lalah Hathaway quietly serenading in the background. Brandy is featured on the chorus and the track-ending ad libs of the otherwise mediocre "Somethin Bout You." Carl Thomas keeps it going with the infectious groove "If That Ain't Love," but then switches gears for the sultry "Late Night Rendezvous." The title track "So Much Better" is only so-so, but he does well with the reggae-inspired rhythm "Oh No (You Can't Be Serious)." Dave Hollister does a surprising duet with Carl Thomas for the wonderfully composed "Can't Get Over." "How Can We" is a song about getting past the drama in order to fix a relationship. "If You Ever" and "Say I Do" are both warmhearted cuts that the ladies will enjoy because of the subject matter, while "Home" is a ballad that speaks to those who might be away from their loving family for one reason or another. He closes with a remix of "Late Night Rendezvous" that features Bay Area rapper E-40 and a remix of "Oh No" featuring Baby Cham. Carl Thomas definitely put in some work for So Much Better. His long-time fans should have no problems with this album, and new listeners should appreciate it too because it's So Much Better.

Despite his recent troubles with the government (namely...the IRS), Ron Isley has continued to supply us with knockout singles and albums for decades. Celebrating their 50-year anniversary in the music business, the Isley Brothers are a true example of having nothing to prove to anyone. Who doesn't own at least one Isley Brothers album? Countless artists have either sampled their music or covered their songs for their own projects. I remember a time when I practically played Beautiful Ballads every day! Even the whole Mr. Biggs moniker isn't distracting because Ron Isley is probably the coolest 65-year-old walking the Earth. The man can get away with almost anything...when it comes to music. The latest effort is Baby Makin' Music, a title that many people have labeled the group's countless hits as being. This album is no different.There isn't anything to say negatively about this album. The first single "Just Came Here To Chill" has the ability to please die-hard fans as well as newcomers. The song incorporates the new Isley sound and couples it with the old school feel that most are familiar with. This style continues on songs like "You're My Star," "Pretty Woman," and "Forever Mackin'." R. Kelly makes an appearance on the sultry "Blast Off."Fans of the classic crooning won't be left disappointed. "Show Me," "Gotta Be With You," and "Give It To You" could be placed smack dab in the middle of any self-made mix cd of classic Isley slow jams. They close out the album with the smooth playa cut "Heaven Hooked Us Up" and the equally suave "You Helped Me Write This Song." You have to give the Isley Brothers their props for being in the game longer than anybody else out. They are truly living legends who deserve any and all lifetime achievement awards that are out there. Do yourself a favor and pick up Baby Makin' Music...and start popping out those little rascals!

In my eyes, Ludacris has been 'on again, off again' artist throughout his rap career. Back For The First Time only had a few cuts that I could really get into. But then he put out the monster hit album Word of Mouf and I was a certified fan for the moment. Then he started going downhill again with Chicken-N-Beer and Red Light District. With two uninspiring D.T.P. compilations to boot, it was a wonder if Ludacris would get back to the days of Word of Mouf or not. With Release Therapy, Ludacris had a lot of things to prove to all the doubters, including myself. Luckily he's broken out of his little funk and put together an album that rivals any previously released projects."Grew Up A Screw Up" featuring Young Jeezy is hard-hitting and showcases his edgier side. "Money Maker" with Pharrell is strictly for the radio and does it's job of generating buzz on urban and Top 40 radio. "Girls Gone Wild" is along the same lines, while "Ultimate Satisfaction" featuring Field Mob uses unique sounds and effects that make you think beyond the standard hip-hop formula. He pounds the pavement with "Mouths To Feed," a song that speaks on doing what it takes to make it in this world. Bobby Valentino drops in to lend his chops for the groovy 'ladies only' track "End Of The Night" while "Woozy" features R. Kelly giving his signature sound to a song that's worthy of being a radio single.The second half of the disc is more therapeutic in that it focuses more on reflecting on real issues than anything. Even though "Tell It Like It Is" is his answer song to the whole Chingy situation, he also gives some good advice for those looking to break into the industry. "War With God" is a 'Scarface-like' track that talks about life in general, while "Do Your Time" featuring Beanie Sigel, Pimp C, and C-Murder takes a look at prison life. The standout track of the entire album has to be "Slap" where Ludacris speaks on the ills of the world that make him feel like "slappin' a n!gg@ today!" Another prominent track is the thought-provoking song "Runaway" featuring Mary J. Blige. The closing track "Freedom of Preach" offers up a testimony by Ludacris about what he has learned and experienced throughout his life.Ludacris may have recently cut his hair, but he's grown into a worthwhile entertainer. Release Therapy is the first time we've been able to hear the real Ludacris. Sure, he has his party tracks and his radio tracks that will continue to be played for the masses. But the real hip-hop fans out there will appreciate the insight that Ludacris has given on this album. Some may write him off and say he's gone soft, but I say he's reached a higher ground with Release Therapy.

In spite of all the outside shenanigans that R Kelly has been dealing with the past 3 years or so, the Pied Piper has managed to sustain an ongoing musical career while most everybody else with major cases against them have fallen off the radar. But just because he's been focusing on his music doesn't mean his music has been good. Ever since TP-2.com, Kels has been lacking that spark he had for the first half of his career. TP-2.com, Chocolate Factory, and Best of Both Worlds 1 & 2 were only average albums at best, and Happy People/U Saved Me was more of a specialty product for R Kelly and was meant for very specific tastes. Now we have TP-3.com: Reloaded, an obvious rip from the Matrix movies. And just like the cinematic trilogy, the latest installment doesn't quite live up to expectations.With a song like "Sex Weed", it's a wonder why he didn't slap himself. This is like "You Remind Me of Something" on R. Kelly when he compared the opposite sex to a Jeep....now he's comparing them to an illegal substance? But that's not the only ridiculousness on this album, as you probably guessed from this one example. "Burn It Up," "Slow Wind" and "Reggae Bump, Bump" are the reggae songs that R. Kelly obvious has no expertise in singing, and the latter song features Elephant Man whose stardom is as obsolete as Ricky Martin nowadays. "Put My T-Shirt On" sounded better when it was called "T-Shirt and Panties On" and "Sex In The Kitchen" has as much sex appeal as actually bumpin' and grindin' right by tonight's plate of Hamburger Helper. The production on "Remote Control" is suspect, and why he would work with Nivea for the song "Touchin" is perplexing considering how wack the R-Kelly produced "Laundromat" was. "Happy Summertime (Remix)" with Snoop Dogg is a direct correlation with 12 Play's "Summer Bunnies."The only songs worth a listen on this album include "Playas Only" featuring The Game (who needs to stop recycling lyrics considering he only has one real album), "Hit It Til The Morning" featuring Chi-Town's own Twista and D.O.D. (Do or Die), "Kickin It Wit Your Girlfriend," and "Love is What We Makin." The five-part "Trapped In The Closet" series is entertaining one time through, but there is really no reason to listen to any of these songs over and over again. TP-3.com: Reloaded presents one of R Kelly's worst showings compared to his other albums. But considering how fast the disc is flying off shelves and how long his legal battles have been going, in most people's eyes....R Kelly can do no wrong.

With the absence of Flesh (when was he ever a full-fledge member?) and the enigmatic Bizzy Bone, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony is down to the core trio of Wish, Layzie, and Krayzie Bone. And even though they've been holding it down most of the time, the years haven't been very friendly to the Cleveland natives. After years of disappointing projects and a fan base that is completely shaken up, the crew is fighting to prove their importance to the ever-changing rap game. Strength & Loyalty could spell either a inevitable end or a prosperous beginning for the new lineup. The Game holds his own next to the Bone members on "Streets" with help from Will.i.am on production. The super radio-friendly "I Tried" is a no-brainer with the mellow beat riding under their subdued vocals and guest vocals from Akon. Akon pops up again on the somber album closer "Never Forget Me." Mariah Carey and Bow Wow infuse their talents into "Lil Love" while Swizz Beatz brings his expertise for "Bump In The Trunk." And the brilliant pairing of the collective with their fellow Midwesterner Twista for "C-Town" marries the rap styles nicely since they are so similar. Thankfully though, Bone can sustain without the collabos as well. "Sound The Same" speaks to the ever repetitive story of people trying to escape the hood anyway they can. The sinister sounding "9MM" is a throwback to their darker early days of rapping, along with thugged-out "Gun Blast" and the hyperactive delivery of "Flowmotion." And even though the Fleetwood Mac sample on "Wind Blow" is out of place on this LP, Strength & Loyalty redeems the faith in the group by their long-standing fans. And with the remaining members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony each showing their worth throughout the album, there's no reason for anyone to write them off just yet.

R&B compilations can be a great way to get a collection of great songs that you have grown to love. Whether it be a bunch of slow jams, chart-toppers, or one-hit wonders, there's almost always a reason to get a music compilation these days. Sometimes the song you want is on an album that is out of print. Other times you have old tapes or records that have reached the end of their usefulness and you don't necessarily want to buy the whole album all over again. So buying a compilation saves you from missing out on all your favorite music you would otherwise have to live without. The Body and Soul series has been one of those standout collections that people can instantly rely on. The latest offering is Midnight Fire, a collection of hit R&B songs from the 90s and early 2000s. Standout songs like D'angelo's "Untitled (How Does It Feel?)," Jill Scott's "A Long Walk," "You Don't Know My Name" by Alicia Keys, "Why You Wanna Act Like That" by Tyrese, and Jon B's "R U Still Down" bless this collection. You are also treated to some classic gems from Dru Hill ("These Are The Times" and Sisqo's "Incomplete"), Ginuwine ("So Anxious"), R. Kelly ("When A Woman's Fed Up" and "Be Careful" with Sparkle), and Jagged Edge ("Promise"). There are a few songs like Toni Braxton's "Spanish Guitar," Donell Jones' "You Know What's Up," or Santana's "Maria, Maria" that don't blend well with the rest and shouldn't have made the cut to begin with. This collection probably doesn't have the strength of previous Body And Soul collections. But all in all, Midnight Fire is worth checking out for that pure, nostalgic feeling you get when listening to good, contemporary R&B music.

"Who the heck is Little Brother?"That's probably the first thing that came to your mind when you scrolled down to this review. Or even if you are familiar with them now, I bet that was your first response when you were first introduced to them. I won't lie...up until this album, I was even wondering the same. I won't sit here and say I've been listening to them from day one because I haven't. My little brother (actually my younger brother-in-law) mentioned Little Brother to me not too long ago....and guess what I said? Not only did I say it, I meant every word of it. Now that the conglomerate have put out The Minstrel Show, the follow-up to their independent releases The Listening and The Chitlin Circuit 1.5. Why are they getting attention now with The Minstrel Show, you ask? Well, they have recently signed to Atlantic Records, so that doesn't hurt one bit. And probably the biggest reason would have to be the album's heading itself. I mean, wouldn't you want to know who are these people who chose to have such a controversial title for their ultra-commercial debut. Luckily for them, The Minstrel Show is more than just a enthralling name.With production reminiscent of Pete Rock, 9th Wonder makes beats that rappers Phonte and Big Pooh can bring their own uncomplicated lyrics to. Their sound reminds you of old school pioneers as well as newer acts that have borrowed the "simple yet thoughtful" approach that a lot of rap groups have gravitated towards. "Still Lives Through" is a great example of their varying styles, channeling the rhyme scheme and flow of 90's supergroup A Tribe Called Quest (when they were in their prime, not including the later questionable stuff featured on Beats, Rhymes, and Life and The Love Movement). Songs like "All For You" and "Hiding Place" have such a close resemblance to stuff you'd hear on an album by Slum Village, the latter song actually featuring Elzhi of Slum Village. The production on songs like "Say It Again," "Lovin' It" featuring Joe Scudda, and "The Becoming" put you in the mind of people like Kanye West and Dj Premier with their throwback samples. Just when you thought that was it, there are even more similarities that are present on other songs. "Beautiful Morning" puts you in the mind of Common, "Not Enough" reminds you of "Respiration" by Black Star, and "Watch Me" sounds like Jurassic 5.As you can see, Little Brother doesn't have a unique sound, rather a mesh of sounds from different people that have been around for years. Just the thought of being this versatile is something that every group that they are compared to wishes they had for themselves. The Minstrel Show is arranged in such a way that it is almost like a journey as well as a parody of sorts. Their mockery of R Kelly and Mr. Biggs on the song "Cheatin" is one of the funniest songs you will have heard in a long time. And that's exactly what is missing in hip-hop today...flexibility. Little Brother delivers that and more, and hopefully this will be the launch pad that will catapult them to a level of success that is just as good as their counterparts...if not more!

Deemed by Simon Cowell as the one to beat when she was on American Idol, this songstress captured the hearts of millions as she sung every song she belted out. When she was voted out prematurely, the viewing audience as well as the judges were in utter disbelief. She had done so much to get to that stage in her career where the world could witness her giving the other contestants a run for their money. Being a part of a band and traveling the world prior to the whole American Idol thing, she got the experience she needed to prepare her for future success. Having proved her vocal abilities to anyone who witnessed her singing on the show, Latoya London easily inked a deal with Peak Records and began working on her debut album Love and Life.She starts off the cd with the song "Scandalous" where she talks about doing more than just flirting but still comes off as a fun song regardless. "Learn To Breathe" is the type of song that a lot of people have come to enjoy from the American Idol contest, but this power ballad doesn't come off as overwhelming or cheesy like other singers tend to do. The belting out spills over into tracks like "All By Myself" and "Waiting For You." "Appreciate" featuring Black Thought of the Roots is a entertaining track that a lot of women can sing out loud about their own significant others. Feel-good songs like "Meet Me Halfway," "Anything," and "More" are more than just meaningless filler that plagues a lot of R&B; albums on the market. Latoya keeps within her niche with the heartfelt "I Can't Hide (What's In My Heart)" and the passionate "State of My Heart." She ventures into the traditional jazz world with the song "How I Love The Rain"Only a few wayward songs make their way on an otherwise stellar album. "Every Part Of Me" is just a little plain, "Non A Whatcha Do" simply doesn't fit with the album, and "Practice Makes Perfect" comes off as a cute little song more suited for a younger singer trying their hand at attaining a singing career. Latoya London is well on her way to getting the recognition she so rightly deserves. Even though Peak Records is traditionally a jazz and adult contemporary label, it could ultimately prove to be her only roadblock if she doesn't get the right push that someone like J Records or Columbia could have provided for her. We can only hope that she made the right decision and that Latoya London will be around for years to come.

I must admit...when I first heard that Tyrese was doing a double album, I almost instantly wrote it off as a bad idea. Then when I heard that the second disc would be a rap album, I was a little surprised. Who knew Tyrese knew how to rap? So I couldn't wait to listen to the rap disc, but first I had to check out his mainstay to make sure things were still copasetic on the R&B; tip. The first disc starts off with the lead off single "One," a wonderful pick for Tyrese who always gives us at least ONE hot R&B; single per album. But then he shocks us with another banger right after with "Lights On," a great follow-up single if he chooses to stick to promoting his R&B; tracks. Lil Jon makes a perplexing appearance on the R&B; portion of this double album for a still convincingly good "Turn Ya Out." "Come Back To Me Shawty" is a decent offering, but "Better To Know" is arguably his worst track in his career considering the horrible idea that it's okay for both sides to sleep around as long as you're upfront about it! Luckily he goes back to acceptability with "Gotta Get You," "Morning After," and "Hurry Up." He enlists the help of R. Kelly for the average remix of "Signs of Love Makin' Part II." Tyrese closes the R&B; disc with "Better Than Sex," a song where he declares that a certain someone is worth more than just a 'one night stand' to him.Now begins the lyrical prowess simply known as Black-Ty! After a very intimidating intro, Black-Ty lays the foundation with "I Salute," a testament to the rapper's ability. He then blows up the spot with "Roses," a song where Black-Ty questions whether this chick is the 'rose' he's been looking for. Method Man is outshined on "Get It In" while Black-Ty holds his own next to Too Short, Snoop Dogg, and Kurupt on "Get Low." David Banner and Lil Scrappy rock it out on the amped up "U Scared." Mannie Fresh stops through to give his signature sound for the certified baller's anthem "What It Is." Snoop Dogg and Kurupt make a second appearance for the West Coast styling of "Roll The Dice." Kurupt pops up again with help from The Game for "Ghetto Dayz," a song where Black-Ty and Tyrese both shine for their respective genres. Just for good measure, Kurupt does one last appearance to do a jarring dialogue with Black-Ty for "Fly Away." The standout track on this album has to be "Broke @$$ N!gg@s" where he addresses all the envious homies from his past. He closes the stellar rap album with "Alter Ego" where he trades verses with R&B; singer Tyrese much like Warren G and Nate Dogg did for "Regulate." The Rap side of this album is outstanding and leaves listeners begging for more. And just like this new Hip-Hop artist, this entire review is nothing more than a joke. So as far as Black-Ty is concerned, you should be putting the second disc to good use and play it when you need a good laugh.

I have to admit that when I heard there was a new rapper out of Detroit, I immediately thought about the success that Eminem and company have had in recent years. Well, it seems this newcomer Trick Trick has enlisted the help of Marshall Mathers and his colleagues for his debut album The People Vs. But saying that, it actually isn't as much as it probably should have been.Trick Trick does lay out all his past troubles on "M-1," which in turn gives an insight to what seems to be details involving a shooting and the accusations hailed at his involvement. To my amazement, Trick Trick's bitterness is evident on almost the ENTIRE album...a bold move for any debut artist. "Welcome To Detroit City" with Eminem and "War" featuring Obie Trice are the strongest songs, followed by the oddly smooth delivery of "Leave Your Past" "Big Mistake" and "Let Roll" featuring Mr. Porter.But there isn't much left on the album that you can consider great considering they almost all have some form of angst behind them. "Attitude Adjustment" features Jazze Pha doing a laid back beat, but then Trick Trick's lyrics are too hard for the song. There's even a wack track with Eminem on it! The song "No More To Say" features a disappointing showing by both Eminem and Proof. And the three closing tracks ("What Da F*ck," "Let's Scrap,"and "Head Bussa") are all over-the-top in their ferociousness.Trick Trick might want to take a break, take a few more notes, and come back with a cool head. It's obvious he's mad at the world over his past legal troubles, but a lot of people aren't in the mood to hear such things when they're buying an album. Most people want to escape from the B.S. that the world displays, but Trick Trick brings it all to the forefront for all to see. Sadly, The People Vs. still has Trick Trick fighting to prove to everybody that he truly is worth your attention.

This is a rising star in every sense of the word. I was very afraid that she would be unnoticed in this oversaturated music business. Her debut single "I Changed My Mind" came and went with little attention to this seductive siren. And then the album kept being pushed back...the tall tale signs of an artist that the label might have doubts about even putting an album out for. But then the Crucial Keys assist on "I Just Want It To Be Over" brought the fire back, and the album finally came out with 89,000 copies (which is damn good for a debut artist) and plopped at number six on the Billboard charts! Her album reminds of what an album should sound like. You can tell from the listening to the album that Ms. Cole has been through a LOT of heartache. Songs like "I Should Have Cheated" are very convincing and will some women contemplating their own relationships. And then right after that is the song "Guess What" where she basically goes off and says she's getting away from the crap she has been putting up with. Even "You've Changed", an answer song to the Jay-Z's "Song Cry", makes you see the the ladies side of the story when it comes to significant other pulling a Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde on your relationship. But don't think for a minute that all this bitterness is all Ms. Cole has to offer.

Most R Kelly fans have everything this man has put out anyways. But for those who were late jumping on the bandwagon, Remix City Volume One serves up the hottest (and a few not so hot) remixes that span R Kelly's entire career. Remixes for classics songs like "Bump and Grind," "Slow Dance," "Your Body's Callin'," "Sex Me," "I Can't Sleep Baby," and "Down Low" already make this disc worth the money. Additional jams like the remixes for "I Wish (To The Homies That We Lost)," "I Mean (I Don't Mean It)" "Step In The Name Of Love,"and "Ignition" further exemplify the worth of this disc. Some songs like the two "Feelin' On Your Booty" remixes as well as "Slow Wind" and "Burn It Up" could have been left off and replaced with other remixess. I guess we'll have to wait for the obviously-needed Volume Two for any other jems.

Soul Symphony is Will Downing's TWELVE album! Did you read that correctly, people? Album Number 12! Will Downing came out 17 years ago when he released his debut self-titled album in 1988 under the 4th & Broadway record label, the same people that put out Paid In Full for Eric B and Rakim! Usually when people talk about a long-standing career, they are talking about a dozen or so albums over 20 or 30 or even 40 years. This man is cranking out albums like there is no tomorrow. And if you're already familiar with his music, then you know that his crooning has for the most part remained consistent since day one. So with Soul Symphony, Will Downing is pretty much continuing to please his faithful followers and entice new listeners to become fans.One of my favorite songs of all time is his duet with Rachelle Ferrell entitled "Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This" from his Love's The Place To Be album in 1993. I've been a fan ever since seeing that live-in-concert video on BET that day (that was the first year I ever had cable!) More than a decade later, and I'm still amazed at the vocals and the lyrics that Will Downing has always had in his repertoire. He's often slumped into the Smooth Jazz category, but Will Downing can easily be enjoyed by R&B; lovers as well. "Put Me On" is sort of like a stepper's song only without the illustrious R. Kelly at the helm. Another song entitled "Soul Steppin" is obviously geared towards the stepping crowd as well as "Will Still Loves You." But Will Downing slows it down with songs like the groovy "What's It Gonna Be," the seductive "Make Time For Love," and "Crazy Love." But his most noticeable album tracks tend to be cover songs, and he does his own rendition of the classic "Superstar" that another crooner named Luther Vandross made a great remake of.His other two songs on the album are traditional Will Downing songs, namely "A Promise" and "Heart Of Mine." There's not a lot of bad things to say about Will Downing...and why would you? The man has put in his time and done what he's needed to do to stay in the music business for so long. Sure he doesn't go Gold or Platinum like other fly-by-night artists, but in the end Will outshines them all when it comes to worthiness and having a long-standing career. I've had the pleasure of seeing him in concert a few years ago, sharing the stage with Phil Perry, Chante Moore, and Gerald Albright. It was easily one of the most delightful concerts that I got to share with the woman who would ultimately become my wife. And sitting in the front row to see her favorite singer Chante Moore perform and one of my favorite singers made it all worth it. Hopefully Will Downing will support Soul Symphony with a tour and you'll be able to witness it all for yourself.

Ceelo Green has been trying to get anybody's attention for some time now since leaving Goodie Mob a few years back. Ceelo Green And His Perfect Imperfections was way outside of the norm compared to anything on Goodie Mob's Soul Food or Still Standing. Cee-Lo Green...Is The Soul Machine also did little for his career despite being one of the most creative disc to come out that year. Now he pairs up with Danger Mouse, the producer/DJ who brought us the Grey Album (Jay-Z's lyrics from The Black Album mixed with songs from The Beatles' White Album). The two put their creative minds together for a smorgasbord of cuts that make up St. Elsewhere, the debut offering from the collective known as Gnarls Barkley."Crazy" seems to be the world's favorite track including Paris Hilton, who is rumored to be including a cover of the song on her upcoming album! But the creative juices keep flowing well past "Crazy." "Go Go Gadget Gospel," is a melting pot of high-energy beats and inspired lyrics possibly from a higher power than Cee-lo himself. The moody backdrop on "St. Elsewhere" along with Cee-Lo's sermon-like lyrics give the song its infectious appeal. "Gone Daddy Gone" is an interesting spin on Brit Rock and Electronica fused together. "Smiley Faces" is a bebop-meets-experimental groove that continues the hypnotic fascination that is present throughout the album. "The Boogie Monster" is a little too trippy, while "Feng Shui" couples an Asian undertone with a down-tempo riff. "Just A Thought" sounds like something that would have been a jam session from the recording of Andre 3000's The Love Below."Transformer" sounds like a sped-up Cee-lo cut from one of his solo efforts while the melodic "Who Cares" is a good contender for a second single. The album closes with the enchanting grooves of "On-line," the overly-odd "Necromancing," the hyperactive medley of "Storm Coming," and the head-nodding jam titled "The Last Time." Gnarls Barkley is like nothing else on the market....that's for sure. And St. Elsewhere is a good choice for something different yet refreshing at the same time.

Nine times out of ten you haven't heard of Conya Doss. This is her second release, with the first being A Poem From Ms. Doss, and both being released independently. You probably won't find these at your local Sam Goody or Tower, but you can find both at Amazon.com (see link to the left). A Poem From Ms. Doss was an album with music comparable to the likes of Vivian Green or Adriana Evans, but the voice was still undeniably exceptional. Just Because is more of the same from Ms. Doss, proving with each note that it doesn't matter whether you're independent or with a major label.Standout tracks include the smooth "Missing You," the title track "Just Because," "Stay," and the funky "Damn That." But a definite personal favorite has to be "Ain't Givin' Up" with the kind of "feel good" message and expressions that most R&B; artists tend to not talk about. It's not all about bashing the brothers with Ms. Doss, but she does gives her two cents on songs like "Here We Go Again" and "What Should I Do." It's almost a shame that Conya Doss can be so slept on and underrated at at time when we are practically begging for good music. If you have been looking high and low for a worthwhile R&B; cd, Just Because is definitely one to drop your dead presidents on.

The heyday for Daz and Kurupt was easily back in the mid 90s when they had the other artists like Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg on their debut albumDogg Food. Another thing that set that album apart was the fact that Daz's production skills were bar none and Kurupt had superior lyrics that were comparable to Snoop Dogg's verses anyday. So for Dogg Chit, it would only make sense for them to try to recreate that magic or come close to it. After the first listen, it becomes clear that those good ol' days are impossible to recreate. They clearly attempted a more streamline West Coast album this time out, resorting more on drum kicks, synthesized melodies, and hard-hitting bass lines. The problem is that it all sounds forced, like the songs "Mo Murder," "Get Out Of My Way," "I'll Bury Ya," and countless other tracks. The only good songs are the ones that feature other artists, a formula that speaks volumes to the relevance of Daz and Kurupt. The Game reps for the West to the fullest with his stellar guest appearance on "Anybody Killa." Snoop Dogg validates the duo with his presence on "Vibe" as well as "Pull Them Draws Down" and "Bucc 'em" (the latter song also features RBX and serves as one of the bonus selections for Best Buy version of the album.) The inclusion of Too Short on the unimpressive collabo "Can't Get Enough" and Bad Azz on the substandard "Where U From" was a total waste of time and shows that having a guest star doesn't always salvage the track. There are a sprinkling of mediocre tracks to fill the rest of the album. The sad thing is that their last albumCali Iz Activewasn't nearly as good asDogg Food. And since Dogg Chit is worst than that album, it regrettably lives up to its title in more ways than one.

It's been years since we had the pleasure of hearing a solo Redman joint...especially one that's worth listening to! The last good album was 1998's Doc's Da Name, although the dismal album Malpractice was released in 2000. But just listening to the intro track "Fire," it becomes clear that Red Gone Wild is the real deal. The album has the feel of a mixtape, but without the yelling deejays or the redundancy of tracks that serve no purpose. Even though "Bak Inda Buildin" clocks in under 3 minutes (just like "How U Like Dat" later in the album), it still delivers the energy we've been accustom to hearing from Redman and segues into the equally hyper "Put It Down" and "Gimmie One." "Sumtn 4 Urrbody" features virtual unknowns named Blam, Runt Dog, Ready Roc, Icadon, and Saukrates showcasing their best licks and it's amazing that the track still stands at less than 4 minutes. The Scott Storch produced "Freestyle Freestyle" is an enjoyable track with the feel of a true freestyle with its uncomplicated background and lyrical veracity. Veteran Def Squad members Erick Sermon and Keith Murray regroup for the convincing posse cut "Walk In Gutta" while R&B newcomer Melanie Rutherford [...] gives an impassioned hook for the indelible melody of "Wutchoogonnado." "Blow Treez" is a well-performed collabo that features partner-in-rhyme Method Man and Ready Roc. "Merry Jane" is a fun, entertaining tune that pairs Red with Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg. "Dis Is Brick City" and "Rite Now" both showcase classic Redman while "Hold Dis Blaow" rocks an infectious beat that makes it one of many standouts on the album. He closes with the recurring "Superman Lova" featuring Hurricane G and Melanie Rutherford (it's presented as two connected tracks with the same title) and the tenacious "Suicide" that's embodies all the intensity that Redman has been known to display from time to time. Red Gone Wild personifies a rapper whose talent far exceeds most others in the industry today. Redman's future as a rapper is proven with Red Gone Wild, and he'll never have to worry about losing his appeal if he keeps putting out albums like this.

Hil St. Soul is definitely a duo that you should know by now. Any way you look at it, Hil St. Soul possesses some of the best material that any R&B; composer would relish at having. After discovering a song from their first album Soul Organic purely by accident in 2001, I was hooked from that moment to the smoothed-out sound that was lacking in R&B; music at the time. The songs from that album were more suitable for a smooth jazz station than the traditional mainstream R&B; stations. Then the British collective put out Copasetik and Cool in 2004, lacing in a few mid-tempo tracks and danceable cuts. Now in 2006, Hilary Mwelwa and her musical partner Victor release SOULidified, arguably the best album to come out this year so far.That's saying a lot, I know. But one listen and you will see, or rather hear, why this is the case. The compelling vocal range of Hilary coupled with Victor's masterful production is unrivaled to say the least. From the opening track "Hey Boy," you know Hilary means business when she says "Baby take your time / I want to feel the wave of your emotion." Following that is the mouth-watering "Sweet On You," and the laidback harmony of "It's OK." "Goodbye" is a great first single selection, reminiscent of a Faith Evans or a Kelly Price in their prime. "Betta Days" sounds good enough to have been done by Kanye West with it's old school sounding sample riding the background. "Can We Spend Some Time" borrows the melody from Eddie Kendrick's "Intimate Friends" but resorts to original lyrics rather than covering his work. "We Don't Talk" is a great choice for a second single with its rising riffs and unadulterated vocals. "2 Good To Be True" is a solid R&B; tune, along with the rhyme-infused "Smokey Joint." "Baby Come Over" pairs Hilary's siren-like voice with that of up-and-coming R&B; new jack Dwele for one sultry selection.The group closes out the album strong with "One Of A Kind" and "Time For Love," two seductive cuts that will not pose any problems getting the mood right. SOULidified is a complete album through and through. Don't let your hesitation get the best of you just because you might not be familiar with any of their work. Do yourself a favor and put your order in now for a true Grammy contender for R&B; Album of the year.

Will Downing has been around for a LONG time. Entering his 18th year in the business, Downing continues to keep his name out there despite the fame and fortune that others have gotten. Making good music and sharing it with the fans that he does have seems to be the main focus for Will Downing. After accumulating 12 albums over the years, it's a daunting task to select the best of the best for a snapshot collection that will only feature 12 songs. 20th Centery Masters' Millenium Collection for Will Downing does fairly well in picking out the best songs for the compilation. And like many other collections in this product line, it is not meant to be a definitive collection that has all of his hits to date.For the casual fan of Will Downing, the Millenium Collection does its job. It has signature songs like the wonderful duet with Rachelle Farrell "Nothing Has Ever Felt Like This" and his spectacular covers of Rose Royce's "Wishing On A Star," Angela Bofill's "I Try," Deniece Williams' "Free," and Bonnie Raitt's "I Can't Make You Love Me." His song "Stop, Look, Listen To Your Heart" was a standout from the Pleasures of the Night album with Gerald Albright. It even includes his later hits like "Cool Water" from 2002's Sensual Journey, "A Million Ways" from 2003's Emotions and the fantastic ballad "Crazy Love" from his latest studio album Soul Symphony.If you wanted the absolute best cuts from his career, then Will Downing's Millenium Collection is a good starter album. But take it from a fan who owns EVERY Will Downing album (including his Christmas, Love and You holiday album), you certainly don't want to stop there because there is much more to Will Downing than the 12 cuts on this collection.

In a R&B world where albums seem to be hit or miss as of late, Brian McKnight's latest disc Ten is surprisingly good. There is a heavy dose of familiarity, both with what McKnight is used to giving as well as the production style from today's hottest beat makers. An great example of the latter is "Used To Be My Girl." With Tim and Bob lending their signature sound, it forces the listener to compare McKnight to Bobby Valentino since he's known for using a similar format for his songs. A track that sounds like a Tim and Bob song (actually produced by Brian Cox) titled "Comfortable" is just as good. McKnight does include his 'steppers' song "Find Myself In You" on this album, a cut that was previously on the soundtrack to Madea's Family Reunion. "What's My Name" sounds like it came straight from one of his earlier albums outside of the hint of falsetto which tends to be more prevalent on his later records. "Unhappy Without You" is another Tim and Bob production that tastefully uses a touch of hip-hop for the background (anybody remember Souls of Mischief's mega hit "93 Til Infinity"?). Brian McKnight busts out on of his impassioned love songs "A Little Too Late" and "Missing You." Brian conjures up a little 70s funk for "Shoulda Been Lovin' You," a song that puts you in the mind of Marvin Gaye instantly. "Again" is a nice mid-tempo cut produced by Tim and Bob while "More and More" is a quaint serenade placed eloquently over a piano riff. The final Tim and Bob offering titled "Can't Leave You Alone" reverts back to their familiar production but includes a guest rapper to break up the flow a bit. "I Do" is basically classic Brian McKnight in every sense. He also proves he can still do power ballads too with "The Rest Of My Life." He closes this phenomenal album with "Red White And Blue," a surprising poignant duet with Rascal Flatts and "Don't Take Your Love Away," a song that stands on its own even though (only for a moment) it sounds like a remix of Janet Jackson's "I Get Lonely." Although Ten is not a perfect ten as far as ratings go, it certainly has the makings to be one of his best albums to date.

Wordsworth is actually not a newcomer. He's been on the scene like a sex machine....okay, maybe not a sex machine, but a machine nonetheless. After gaining fame on the underground with his partner-in-rhyme Punchline as the duo Punch-N-Words, both went on to become the pioneers of the Lyricist Lounge show on MTV. After the fuel went out on that, he re-ignited and released Mirror Music in 2004. Although gaining some buzz in the underground, the album didn't take off like he had hoped. Now after two years, he gets another chance with Mirror Music with the re-release of the album along with a 10-track bonus remix cd compiled by Halftooth Records' in-house producer Oddisee. After hearing the newly re-upped version, there is no reason why Wordsworth shouldn't still be in the spotlight today.Although the original content is still intact, Mirror Music has some of the most creative storytelling this side of the world. Wordsworth lives up to his moniker with songs like the head nodding "Right Now," the self-reflecting of both "12 Months" and "Gonna Be," and "Heads High" with Kenn Starr and Oddisee. He even reunites with Punchline for "Not Fair." Although there are two bonus cuts on Disc One not present on the 2004 version, the real treat comes from the bonus remixes on Disc Two. Oddisse reworks some tracks and makes them better than the original cuts! Some include "What We Gon' Do," "Trust," "Run," and "Gotta Pay."If you are looking for true lyrics and creativity instead of the cookie-cutter formula you get on your favorite radio station, then you should be checking out the deluxe edition of Mirror Music by Wordsworth. Hopefully this will convince him to do some new material and try again at stardom. And even if it doesn't work, all of his words will be worth it.

I'm so happy 'Delirious' is coming out on DVD. This is the concert DVD that solidified the on-screen career of Eddie Murphy and inspired a generation of young comics thereafter. Nothing beats his impressions of The Honeymooners, Mr. T, and Michael Jackson. You see people like Aries Spears trying to emulate that stuff today. And the crazy outlandish stories he told on 'Delirious' also remind you of many comics like Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and others.We all have seen Eddie Murphy go on to bigger and better things. He didn't just put out a movie or two and fade away like most SNL comics. 'Delirious' is a snapshot of who Eddie Murphy was at the time, and any true fan either has (or had) the original copy of this stand-up on VHS or a dubbed copy (like me for years until I misplaced it). This will be a great gift for any Eddie Murphy fan. Get those wish lists ready!

"It's hard being the only real n--ga in this sh-t, man!" I have two problems with that statement from the introduction to Fat Joe's album. One....you aren't Black....and two.....you aren't anywhere near real. I'll give Fat Joe his props, though. I was almost certain he was doomed once Big Pun died (R.I.P.). But, Fat Joe has managed to become even MORE famous after Pun's death. This is mostly due to the ongoing trend of abandoning any credibility with the fan base you had when you first came out (i.e. Ja Rule, Black Eyed Peas, Backstreet Boys, Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera). It seems everybody has to sell themselves out for whatever is popular at the time. Fat Joe proves me right by putting "Lean Back (remix)" and his J-Lo collabo "Hold You Down" on this album! Even 2pac is rolling in his grave over the jacked lyrics from "Temptation" on Fat Joe's first single "So Much More." "My Fofo" is nowhere near the lyrical assassination Jadakiss gave 50 Cent on his dis record. "Get It Poppin" with Nelly is just his attempt at getting heavy rotation at MTV/Top40. "I Can Do U" and "So Hot" featuring R Kelly are along those same lines. He has some bright spots ("Does Anybody Know," "Temptation Part 1 & 2," and "Safe To Say"), but I guess it's all about selling units. Hey!...Joey Crack..."Lean Back" was probably the most popular song of 2004...and Terror Squad might have barely went GOLD! Sometimes selling yourself short DOESN'T pay off. And running back to your original fan base doesn't work either. Don't believe me....ask your buddy Ja Rule.

After a seven year hiatus, this songstress returns for a comeback that many probably wished would have happened sooner. Breaking on the seen in the mid-to-late 1980s, Shanice was the young singer that we all knew and loved. After mega hits like "Silent Prayer" and "I Love Your Smile," the marketing geniuses couldn't capture enough buzz for her later albums. Fast forward to today, and Shanice has yet another opportunity to fight for the attention of the masses. And with Every Woman Dreams, she definitely has the musical artillery to back it all up.Although the album starts with the lackluster "Get Up," it rolls right into the dynamic first single "Every Woman Dreams." It showcases all of her talent and reminds everybody that she is a grown woman doing grown things nowadays. "Things In The Movies" is enjoyable ballad that uses Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' "I Miss You." She gives some good advice with "Keep It To Yourself" and sets the mood with "Take Care of U." "So Sexy" is an unnecessary fast cut, but it's obvious she wants to keep herself from being pigeon-holed as just one thing. "That's Why I Love U" brings it back to the slow jams, infusing a slight touch of old-school percussion in the background. "Crazy 4 U" is a light and sentimental ballad with a lot of crossover appeal. "So Free" expresses the feeling of being autonomous, "Chocolate" compares a man to her favorite candy, and "Lovin' You" is a cover of the classic jam by Minnie Riperton.The tender "Forever Like A Rose," the thought-provoking "Can't Imagine," and the ode to her husband on "Joy" close out this phenomenally impressive album. It's almost scary that Shanice was able to put together such an amazing album after 19 years in the business. You truly won't regret adding Every Woman Dreams to your music collection. It would be a shame for this independent release to go unnoticed by the R&B; market. So help get the word out because that's the only way we will see this illustrious singer get her just due.

We finally get the chance to hear a real album by Queens own Consequence, the same guy that was plastered all over A Tribe Called Quest's albumBeats, Rhymes and Lifefeaturing his cousin Q-Tip. Sure, he had a mixtape album back in 2004 calledTake 'Em to the Cleanersthat few even knew existed. But this was easily the best time for Consequence to come out with his album considering Kanye had to prove himself as a mega-producer, artist, and business man. Once the foundation was created and Kanye started up G.O.O.D. Music, everything was a go for Consequence (his momma named him Dexter Raymond Mills, Jr.) to release his first official album titled Don't Quit Your Day Job. Without question, the production on a majority of the album was on par, so it all really came down to Consequence to deliver on his rhymes. "Callin' Me" is an decent track, but doesn't come close to the overall sound of Don't Quit Your Day Job. "Job Song" focuses on Dexter's thoughts on doing something bigger and better with music once he gets through the whole 'getting by' phase in his life. "Don't Forget Em" is easygoing song, stressing the importance of embracing your past and remembering what got you where you are today. "Uptown" has a good bounce to it, the respectable "The Good, The Bad, The Ugly" features mentor Kanye West, and the laid back "Feel This Way" features John Legend in rare form. "Disperse" is another standout cut that features Gangsta L Crisis (better known as GLC) and Really Doe, while "Who Knew My Luck Would Change" speaks to his thoughts that his career in music was bleak and nobody would ever check for him after all these years. There are some flaws on this album however like the strange "Night Night," the unconvincing hardness of "Uncle Raheim," and the over-the-top production on "Grammy Family" with DJ Khaled, Kanye West, and John Legend. Consequence still show his worth with Don't Quit Your Day Job, and that's what matters when it comes to longevity in the rap business.

The 'velvet teddy bear' resurfaced this year after being out of the limelight for awhile. The American Idol winner has shed a massive amount of weight and continues to strive to lose more. But one thing that is certain is that being gone for so long can have a big impact when it comes to a musical career. Ruben Studdard was hoping that his new album The Return would live up to his debut album. But some might be surprised that the album isn't as polished as that shiny bald head of his.The first single "Change Me" sounds too much like "Sorry 2004" to me. It's still a decent song, but the formula of recreating previous hits just doesn't sit well with fans. Songs like the title track "The Return," "I'm Not Happy," "Get U Loose," and "What Tha Business" are good, but the production and mid-tempo melodies don't complement Ruben's powerful singing ability at all. Some of the better tracks on the album are the seductive "Our Story," the second single "Make Ya Feel Beautiful," and "One Side" (the last two tracks were penned by Ne-Yo). But Ne-Yo missed the mark with "Rather Just Not Know" with objectionable lines like "Tell me another lie/ make me believe it's all in my mind/ tell me you were out with your girls last night/ and that my boys didn't see you with another guy." Other good songs are the self-explanatory "Blow Ya Mind" and the bonus track "If Only For One Night," a cover of the late, great Luther Vandross.It's almost a blessing in disguise that Ruben's album isn't a knockout hit. He needs to take his time and grow into a respectable artist that people can learn to love and appreciate over time. Even the greats like Luther and Stevie didn't have all 5-star albums throughout their career. So just because this album isn't a classic doesn't mean it's not respectable. The Return does what it's supposed to do...fulfill the void that his fan base has been feeling in his absence and further demonstrate that he's a viable R&B; artist who will stand the test of time.

Do you remember the group Public Announcement? They were the ones singing behind the Pied Piper himself on the Born Into The 90s album back in 1992. But after just one album, R Kelly ventured off on a successful solo career while the boys were left to fend for themselves. The group put out two albums of their own and went through a lot of changes over the next decade. They did manage to have some modest hits like "Body Bumpin" and "John Doe" during those times. Now in 2006, the current lineup release their third album titled When The Smoke Clears in hopes of bigger and better things. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in all the years they've had to grow.There are just so many things that kill this album all around. The first thing that any group should NOT do is emulate what their former frontman has done. Well, obviously they didn't get that memo as Public Announcement practically copy everything R Kelly has done over the years. "Stepper Friend" sounds a lot like the stepping songs that R Kelly did for his Happy People album. "What If He Knew" is a virtual copycat of R Kelly's "Down Low" with the falsetto he does on the song. "Guessing Games" sounds suspiciously like "I Wish" in its delivery, "Girl I" and "I'll Be" simply sound like R Kelly-type songs, "Freaky In The Club" is a complete rip of "Snake," and "What's Good" uses similar reggae melodies as those used by Kels. Even songs like the uninteresting sequel "John Doe 2" and a dreadful remake of Rene and Angela's "You Don't Have To Cry" leave you wondering why they even bothered. And a downright ridiculous cut is the song "Let Me."A few tracks like "Yep," "One More Try," and "Put Your Drink Down" are passable but aren't enough to make this album worthwhile. It's bad enough that the group had to resort to putting out an independent album, but a lot of good albums are released independently. But usually someone who hasn't really manage to make much noise on the mainstream front isn't going to do good on an indie like Boss Entertainment. It may be time for these brothers to start considering a regular nine to five like the rest of us. When the smoke clears, I'm immediately shouting out my own Public Announcement: "Don't Even Think About Buying This!"

Keisha White is the real deal Holyfield. Representing North London, the young soul siren embodies that 'it' factor that every artist wishes they possessed. She's got the chops, she's got the looks, and she's got the versatility. But being a world away will limit her exposure to the listening audience in the United States. Nevertheless, Keisha White has the sophistication for the older crowd along with the power ballads that the 'American Idol' audience seems to enjoy hearing week in and week out on the show. And her debut album Out of My Hands is certainly one of those albums that the critics will love and embrace after one listen."The Weakness In Me" is a superb illustration of the vocal gift that Keisha personifies in every note she exclaims in her songs (see link to the video below). Other compelling melodies include "I Choose Life" and "It Takes A Stronger Man." But Keisha White also explores the delicate and smooth side of R&B; with songs like "One Step At A Time," "Love Is The Deepest Hurt," and "Why." She even does a few mid-tempo tracks like the funky "Brother," the title track "Out Of My Hands," the unrelenting "What's On Your Mind" and the cover of the Patti Austin/James Ingram classic "Baby Come To Me." Even the upbeat riff of "Complicated Emotions" doesn't sound out of place despite it being the only cut on the album that comes close to a dance track.A lot of people will try to draw comparisons to people like Toni Braxton, Joss Stone, or Heather Headley. But Keisha White is truly a starlet in her own right. Her gracefulness alone sets her far apart from the pack. And even though Out of My Hands is an import disc, the few extra bucks to get your hands on it will be worth every penny once you play it for the first time in your stereo.

Kev Brown is probably a name few are familiar with, and rightly so. Being pretty much an underground artist, the only thing that most of us know about Kev Brown is his remix version of Jay-Z's Black Album (even though there were countless versions out there at the time). Sounding almost nothing like anyone else in the underground, Kev Brown infuses mellow beats and jazzy chords into his music. He's worked with everybody from Dj Jazzy Jeff to De La Soul to R&B; newcomer Raheem Devaughn. Being both a producer and rapper at the same time is something that most have a hard time accomplishing (except the likes of Kanye West, Dr. Dre, and Jermaine Dupri). I Do What I Do is the perfect title to what Kev Brown is all about.From the start of the album, Kev proclaims he's not trying to change the game or be profound by any means. He's literally doing what he does best and hoping everybody takes his music for what it's worth. "Work In Progress" is a good all-around representation of Kev Brown's signature sound and lyrics. "Beats N Rhymes" features him holding his own alongside Oddisee and Little Brother's Phonte. "Say Sumthin" featuring Quartermaine and Kenn Starr (not the guy from Bill Clinton's impeachment) is much like other underground songs, but the props hailed to Dj Premier, JayDee, and Pete Rock from Kev Brown are where it's at. "Outside Lookin In" featuring Cy Young utilizes an ongoing bass riff that would fit any open mic night. "Struggla's Theme" featuring Grap Luva is another polished cut any underground fan could appreciate."Hennessey Pt 1 & 2" are both smooth grooves in their own rights. The first part features the rapping styles of Kev Brown and Kenn Starr, while the second part consists of a playfully drawn out R&B; bridge featuring Eric Roberson, Chronkite, and Wanya. "Keep On" features Kev Brown trading clever verses with Cy Young. "Alone Again" is an introspective piece featuring Kev giving us his outlook on how his life is. "Hold Fast," "Albany," and "Life A Gamble" are the well-crafted solo tracks from the end of the album. Kev Brown does a superb job of defining his sound, both lyrically and creatively. Although some could compare I Do What I Do with albums by Little Brother or Slum Village, Kev Brown does enough to differentiate himself from the pack.

Eminem was originally going to put out a mixtape just to introduces Shady newcomers Bobby Creekwater, and Cashis. But after some careful deliberations, he decided to go ahead and put out a posse-heavy mixtape instead and market it under his name. The inclusion of everybody from 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks of the G-Unit, D-12, and the new guys, Eminem was able to come up with enough polished tracks for The Re-Up. It also helps Eminem too since it seems like he's been in a little funk lately. Last year he put out a "Greatest Hits" album titled Curtain Call despite the fact that he's only released 4 albums. This is when the rumors of his supposed retirement escalated to an all-time high. So with the help of , Eminem's existence is further extended. Now even though The Re-Up is a well-marketed mixtape, it still has a few cuts worth listening to. The Shady Records posse cut "We're Back" features Eminem along side Stat Quo, Obie Trice, and newcomers Bobby Creekwater and Cashis. The first single "They Don't Know" featuring 50 Cent, Eminem, Cashis and Lloyd Banks is the most mainstream track of all the unreleased material on the album. Stat Quo's solo cut "By My Side" is impressive, along with "Everything Is Shady" by Cashis and "We Ride For Shady" featuring the dynamic duo of Obie Trice and Cashis. There are remixes of other songs that were previously released. Obie Trice offers up two of his own, namely his reworking of D12's 2001 single "Pistol Pistol" from their Devil's Night disc and a remix of his own song "Cry Now" featuring D12's Kuniva, Bobby Creekwater, Stat Quo, and Cashis. Stat Quo and Bobby Creekwater improve upon Eminem and Akon's "Smack That," while Eminem and 50 Cent give us "The Ski Mask Way" remix to enjoy. There are a few missteps like the mundane "Jimmy Crack Corn" by Eminem and 50 Cent, the weird offering of "Whatever You Want" by Mr. Porter and Swifty McKay, and the horrible "Shake That" remix with Bobby Creekwater, Nate Dogg, Obie Trice, and Eminem. Only serious fans of anything Shady should add The Re-Up to their collections, but everybody else should borrow the disc and see if it's worth the time.

Here we go again with another old school legend with nothing to prove. But if you live, eat, and sleep music, then what else is there to do? Enter Scarface with a single and double-disc sequel to his previous installment of My Homies. The whole point of these albums is the collaborations with other legends and new faces, which Scarface seems to keep to a minimal on his other releases. I like it when he puts out these albums because he's forced to step his own game up since it's other people rocking the same track. He also gives the reigns to some of his partners to rock their own songs without the help of Scarface. My Homies, Part 2 delivers on stellar performances from Scarface. It's just too bad his homies didn't follow suit on a majority of the tracks.Ice Cube blasts off his verse on "Definition of Real" with Face and Z-Ro, leaving the two of them sitting on the sidelines. Beanie Sigel keeps up with Mista Mista Scarface on "Never Snitch," while The Game only gives an okay performance. Z-Ro lives up to his name on "Man Cry," a remix of sorts to Scarface's original smash hit. "Street Lights" gives a glimmer of hope to the album's outlook with help from Yung Redd and Lil Ron. But then that hope goes down the drain with "We Out Here" featuring an unspeakable performance from Skip and the Ghetto Slaves as well as a horrifying YODELING sample!Scarface decides to go solo on "Gotta Get Paid," a track that could have had better production. "Club Bangaz" featuring Juvenile and Partners N Crime is just what the title suggests, although Scarface doesn't appear on the song for good reason since he isn't known to do any songs like this. Bun B should have ran for the hills when he heard the 'Gimme A Break' sample on "Platinum Stars," especially with the South's wackest offering of Lil Flip and Chamillionaire putting their lackluster lyrics on the song. "Always" features Spider R.I.P.P.E.R. doing a typical Down South track for the thugs to rock to. Vicious gives an okay track with "Tryin To F*ck Something" while Scarface tries his hand at rocking a reggae beat on "Pass The Itchy."The last two cuts on the album include the Dirty South posse cut "Southern N!gg@" with everybody and they momma spitting a verse (actually just Mr. Lee, 8-Ball, E-Rock, Lil Keke, Slim Thug and the singing of Rell), and Scarface reuniting with his group The Geto Boys for "My Life." All in all, not a bad collection even though it could have been much better. I give Scarface an 'A' for effort, but a 'C' for execution. It's worth you money if you can stomach the bad cuts. Better yet, get your index finger ready to push the skip button on the sprinkling of crap on My Homies, Part 2.

The Roots have always gone against the grain. But even during those times, they've always been able to gather massive crowds for their live shows. And so began the cult following for The Roots, a move that catapulted them into the mainstream with Things Fall Apart and their Grammy Award-winning track "You Got Me." But even that didn't last long considering the fact that subsequent albums barely got any exposure at all. So what's the best way to deal with the issue? How about completely going into left field and releasing Game Theory, a lyrical and musical expedition that leaves many listeners wondering where the hell the Roots are going with this album.After a mellow intro, the album dives right into "False Media," a track that focuses on a repetitive message over spacey sound effects. After getting through that, you're immediately engulfed into the title track "Game Theory" that showcases Black Thought's distinctive flow. "Don't Feel Right" continues Black Thought's lyrical parade alongside traditional Roots production. But that quickly changes with "In The Music," an eclectic myriad of music that rides alongside the near angst delivery from Black Thought. "Take It There" goes barebones with faint melodies and what appears to be a beatbox, but drum kicks and a dreary piano riff appear by song's end. "Baby" is an off the wall song that Andre 3000 would probably have on his album. Things speed up with "Here I Come" featuring Dice Raw, mainly resorting to an hurried approach with the beat and the lyrics. "Long Time" is a laid-back yet funky groove that features Peedi Peedi (formerly Peedi Crack) re-emerging out of oblivion. After the weird and abbreviated "Livin In A New World," we're treated to a 'normal' track titled "Clock With No Hands" featuring a sweet songbird named Mercedes Martinez. "Atonement" is a throwback track to the old days of the 1950s or 1960s with its slow, drawn out melody. The last track is "Can't Stop This" and it goes on and on with a touch of airy notes here and jumpy music there.Game Theory is a tripped out experience worth taking if your ready for that type of thing. Roots fans will probably shy away from this album, but other genres like electronic, trip-hop, and acid jazz will gravitate to something like this. You've been forewarned. But this isn't to say that the album is bad. It's just a new direction for the group as a whole considering the 'hip-hop' crowd wasn't feeling them as of late. Who knows, they could be the next Rage Against The Machine or something.

Boyz II Men have seen the highs and experienced the lows throughout their 15 year career. Having some of the most successful R&B; albums and singles in the history of music says a lot. But the lack of sales and promotion for their last couple of releases says even more. With the departure of Michael McCary due to an ongoing back ailment, Nathan, Shawn and Wanya have been battling for attention that they should have never lost to begin with. But bad business, grueling concert tours, and questionable songwriting decisions left them in the boat they found themselves in. They truly needed something to put them back on the path of success again. So they dusted their shoulders off and came up with The Remedy, an import album (it's set for a 2007 release in the US) that plants them right in the thick of things again.The ballads on The Remedy are outstanding, something that we've known they could do since the days of Cooleyhighharmony. One listen to "Here I Come" will convince any naysayer of their singing ability. "Morning Love" is a sweet, eloquent tune that will instantly make the mood right. "Perfect Love Song" is where they compare the qualities of a woman to what else....the perfect love song! "Gonna Have" is another powerful ballad that is just as good as anything they've put out in the past. Even their mid-tempo and club tracks are substantial, with grooves like "The Last Time," "Crush" and the first single "Muzak" proving their more than just balladeers. The only two songs that don't have that spark like the others are "Ego" and "Booed Up."Boyz II Men has another legitimate chance at getting back in good with the R&B; world, even though I firmly believe that Full Circle was a wonderful yet under-promoted album that should have been their comeback album. But like they always say....good things come to those who wait. And luckily for all the BIIM fans out there, the rumored Valentine's Day release in the states of The Remedy will be worth waiting for. For those who can't wait, you could always drop $25-$33 for the import version right now. But word has it that the US release will be a double disc with a full 2nd disc of re-recorded hits from the past with the music more focused on how they feel today. We'll have to wait and see how that sounds, but if it's anything like the songs on this Japanese import, The Remedy will certainly be well worth the wait.

Many people probably don't even remember Sammie the first time he came out. He was a 12 years old kid who lucked up and got himself a deal with Rowdy Records. Fast forward to 2006 and it becomes clear that music is certainly in his blood. And with a new outlook on life (as well as being grown enough to tackle adult topics), Sammie is ready to prove to the world that he is the real deal. With help from Rowdy Records (didn't know they were even still in existence) and various producers, the self-titled release is now available for the world. And listening to this album will definitely surprise you....in a good way.His debut single "You Should Be My Girl" featuring Sean Paul of the Youngbloodz (and produced by Jazze Pha) is an easy-going ditty that simply appeals to the younger crowd, a smart move in my opinion. "Feelin It" is another Jazze Pha-produced song that sounds like a Ciara track, yet another good decision since she's one of the hottest female singers out right now. But this isn't to say that the production is what carries these songs. Sammie holds his own on both of those songs as well as the standout tracks like "Choose Me," "Another Last Chance," "Mission Impossible," and "Heavenly." The rest of the album is filled with decent material, but it becomes apparent that the songwriting on tracks like "What About Your Friend" and "Let It Ride" could have been tweaked a little bit. And a few songs like "Slow" and "Back 2 Love" sound like he's straining a little too much to hit certain notes.I remember seeing Sammie on Soul Train months ago. He was being introduced and I immediately started laughing because I remember him from years ago. But after listening to him perform both songs on the show, he had actually convinced me that he actually had talent. And Sammie is evidence of that very same notion. With a little more work in the songwriting area and him staying within his singing range, Sammie could still hang with other younger artists like Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, and Trey Songs.
