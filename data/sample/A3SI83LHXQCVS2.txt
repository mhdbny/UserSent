This is one record I don't know if I'll ever forget. I've loved it ever since the first time I listened to it. While some jealous Curve fans may dismiss the album (hey, listen to THEIR 2001 album "Gift" back-to-back with this and tell me who's ripping off who), this album is a bit less in use of the backwards guitar effects and wall-of-sound distortion of the debut. It is an electronic rock album, and one of the absolute finest that I've ever heard.The record can be sexy at times, and it can also be heartbreaking and such at the same time. All 12 songs are amazing. The record begins with the new-wave inspired "Temptation Waits," a Blondie-esque track with lots of hooks and dancier than anything on the debut. "Hammering in My Head" and "Push It" are still as breathtaking as the first time I heard them. "Hammering" shows their artistic experimentalism at its best, and I hear something new in it each time. "Push It" is the main single from the album and quite possibly the greatest. They cleverly borrow from the Beach Boys for a hook and then have a hard-hitting chorus. I hear the album was made with about 120 tracks, and these two tracks certainly make it seem that way. For me, this album is a musical dream. "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" and "You Look So Fine" show a more tender side of Garbage and are true gems. The former is a bit darker of the two, with the bass lines standing out and then the other one is a well-orchestrated track with some awesome Shirley Manson melodies. There's some quirkier tunes in "Wicked Ways" and "Sleep Together," and then the more straightforward tracks like "Dumb," which wouldn't sound too out of place on the first record.Experimentation with great songwriting and hooks all over, it's just hard to ignore this record. The debut is good too, but I felt this album was even better, a progression from that one. I never get tired of listening to any of these songs. One of my top five albums of all-time.

As a huge Depeche Mode fan this wasn't honestly an initial favorite. I found the "bonus" tracks weighed down the material and that some of the songs were more self-indulgent than the album's title suggested. But that doesn't mean that there was not any selling points and there are some real classics in here. Or maybe it's because there's nothing like "Some Great Reward" or "Black Celebration", even "Violator" after it.But "Music for the Masses" is a great creative point and it's great how this got them so big. And the music really is as ambitious as the title. "Never Let Me Down Again" sets the tone for the record, first with guitars and into its keyboard hooks and a more moody chorus, even if some lyrics are a bit WTF ("Promise me I'm as safe as houses/As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers" - and Gore is usually tops at this sort of thing). But the rest of the song more than makes up for it. I always wish they had used the Split Mix over the original. I suggest you look for it if you don't have it yet."Strangelove" is the album's real shining star, though. It has a more reflective and personal feel like the rest of the album. Yet it is also very moving. Not as immediately catchy as some of the poppier earlier stuff. "Behind the Wheel" shows the group's continued love for industrial that began with "Construction Time Again." It is as moving as the driving title and builds up quite nicely. It seems quirky at first but is also an accessible moment of the album.But the three singles, great as they are, aren't the only thunder on the album. "The Things You Said," sung by Gore, is just gorgeous and warrants repeat listens. I like the double-tracked vocals in the chorus, too. "To Have and to Hold" is a black sheep of the album. At first I couldn't get into it because of the distraction of that Russian broadcast thing, but it got better as I heard it. It is a very deep track that specifically longs for love. The thing about this one as opposed to most DM songs is that instead of following a verse/chorus format, it is just one long verse. There is music ascending and descending from the point but that verse is the meat of the song. Deftones did the song some real justice about a decade later. "Pimpf" shows that the choral samples didn't end with the last album and it continued at times. I can see why they opened with the track even if it was the closer on the inital album."Sacred" is where Martin puts religion more into songs and you hear Dave and him singing together on the chorus, which usually works quite well. Not one of the best songs here but definitely worthy of listens. I also enjoy the more standard album track "Nothing," which is translated better in its live versions. A simple message but a nice track to listen to during the middling feelings of your day. But where a song like "Something to Do" is more lively, this is more like a bored goth wallowing in the moment.I'm still not too fond of "Little 15" which while it may be some grand epic has always bored me. Apparently the guys aren't fond of it either and haven't performed it live. "I Want You Now" just doesn't do it for me, even after getting over the whole breathing/double entendre background. Some moments are just hard to embrace. At least it's not the bulk of the album.The "bonus tracks" aren't really that special, honestly. "Pleasure, Little Treasure" isn't listed as its actual Glitter Mix and honestly the regular version was better. It's still decent here though. "Agent Orange" is an amazing example of their experimenting.I personally recommend many of their albums over this one, but it is still quality material. Some fans like it considerably more than I, but I suggest to maybe check others out first. Mid-late '80's' greatest synth act, although it doesn't properly fit a true label.

It really amazes me what Bj&ouml;rk does in her solo albums. You never really know what to expect if you don't follow things enough. And I'll admit, she's a real acquired taste and requires being in the "right" mood to listen to it. But when I'm in that "mood", the stuff is really amazing when I listen to it. And this album is just plain crazy for those. I haven't heard either of her Icelandic-language albums, but where "Debut" was more of a simple electronic record, "Post" is just all over the place. Don't worry; this is a good thing. Because it just makes the album tons of fun.Things start out with the eccentric "Army of Me", one of my favorite songs by her ever. Her voice works well with the cool music. Then it proves to be a one-two punch whenever the outstanding "Hyperballad" follows. It is a classic example of what Bj&ouml;rk does great when she does those avant-garde type songs. It is such a beautiful song. Then the lyrics on "Modern Things" are just plain brilliant, then the percussion just turns it into a better thing. It's just amazing what "Post" delivers in.You get things in the opposite side of the spectrum. Sounding like a track from a musical, the remake of "It's Oh So Quiet" is quite fun. Then there's the mellow, near-baroque influence on "You've Been Flirting Again". "Headphones" also ends this album on a nice note.This album is very haphazardous, but that's kind of what makes it fun. Because of this, some people find it hard to consume the album as a whole. But it is just one of many reasons why people listen to her in the first place. Several songs on here are considered Bj&ouml;rk classics and it's an album that you'll find yourself listening to time and time again. She matched this brilliance on the follow-up album, "Homogenic". Exciting, new ground, good lyrics, there's just nothing not to love about "Post".

I don't know where else they have this edition, but it is the one to get, if you don't want the CD/DVD edition of the record. I actually got mine at Best Buy, and for much cheaper than it's sold on Amazon. I usually kind of cringe when people assume the guys are "dance-pop," but this album is one where I can accept the label, as it is happy and boppy most of the way through. The lyrics aren't meant to be emotional or deep as they have been on later records, and some of it is downright silly.The hits "New Life" and "Just Can't Get Enough" are classics, from a time when Vince Clarke (later in Yazoo and Erasure) was the main song-writer. The former has a kind of Kraftwerk feel, but the vocals don't sound like robots and it's kind of a different league. "JCGE" has been on many soundtracks and '80's compilations, and it's as infectious as the title would imply. There's two versions of the song. The original is the better one, but the Schizo Mix is fine too. (They both appear here.) Some of it is a guilty pleasure, like "Boys Say Go!" has no depth and is possibly kind of embarassing, but it's also catchy. Then some of it is so goofy you don't know to take it seriously. Vince Clarke may have been gay, and "What's Your Name?" could have possibly refered to it, but with the "P-R-E-double T Y" part, it just loses anything worth taking seriously. Some of them were kind of more standard style, like "Puppets," but that one was alright, too.It isn't perfect, as the instrumentals leave something to be desired, and "Tora! Tora! Tora" isn't quite as strong as later stuff Martin L. Gore would be known to write. But it's worth having for four tracks unavailable on the U.S. standard edition: The normal version of "JCGE," "I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead" (originally on the UK record, but an exec was queasy of the inclusion), "Ice Machine," and "Shout." These make it a keeper and will have you repeating the record more.It's a catchy, mindless, fun album. It won't appeal to everyone, especially the classic rock fan who hated synthesizers, and it is sort of cheesy, but that's kind of charming in my eyes. And the group sounds pretty young here, too. Yet, the members were the average age of about 19 during this release. Not as good as the likes ofSome Great Rewardand later albums, but it's still fine enough. If you hate Depeche Mode for sounding too moody, this record will come as a pleasant surprise for you.

Sometimes it is interesting to hear where a band began. And for some people, they will need to approach "Speak & Spell" with an open mind. For one thing, don't expect the hard-rock/gospel approach of "Songs of Faith and Devotion" and don't expect any of the goth from "Black Celebration" forward. It's nothing like that. Alan Wilder hadn't yet joined by this point and Martin Gore only writes two of the 11 songs here. Also, though, there's a good chance that if you love Yazoo and Erasure but care little for later DM, you would enjoy this album. It is not dark at all: It's very happy, and some of it is so in a goofy way.This album's strengths also tend to be the weaknesses. This album practically defines early-'80's synth-pop. All of these are certainly pop songs. There are certainly novelty moments in here: Most notably, the cheesy "What's Your Name?" which actually spells out "p-r-e-double t-y", and which has the chorus of "you're such a pretty boy." "Boys Say Go" and "Nodisco" are quite as explicitly in that category, but will sound goofy to some. Gore's songwriting got better in later DM albums, and the songs he contributes here are kind of average. "Big Muff" is a techno instrumental that kind of goes on for longer than it needs to, although a nice shot of early techno. Oh, and if you don't like repetitive you won't find much in this album either. It is pretty repetitive. The lyrics are not deep. Usually the hooks and structures save it from being disposable, although a few tracks here are pretty forgettable, like "Puppets", which seems more like a B-side to me, the only real dud on here. It is not that bad however, and there are highpoints, particularly in "Just Can't Get Enough." I like the original version more, but the schizo mix works fine enough for me. This is the most famous here for a good reason: It's catchy, it's got the classic pop song-writing, and it's got a sing-along refrain, complete with those cool old-school synths. I like listening to this because the band sounds so young and nave. Gahan hadn't yet gotten his dark, rich voice which came on later albums, but in some ways that makes this a more melodic release. It could also be that he wasn't even 20 yet by the time of the album's release. A few moments, unfortunately, don't do much for me at all.If you're a casual fan, I recommend "The Singles 81>85" and the import version, which is better than the U.S. version. They keep "Dreaming of Me" and "JCGE (Schizo mix)," but those are at the end and it uses the whole original "S&S;" release that had "I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead" (great example of the New Romantic style they had early on; not that depressing), another version of "Any Second Now," as well as tracks non-existant here. It isn't one of my favorite DM albums, but the ceiling is pretty high for them if you ask me. It is most certainly the song-writing of Vince Clarke, for better or worse.

Okay, I'll have to get this point across: I really love Beck. I pretty much enjoy every one of the major label albums from the '90s. Well, I think "Sea Change" was a bit overrated but good, and enjoyed "Guero" slightly more. Unfortunately, while being like a counterpart to that album, this album forgot to fix the last problem: We get a few flashes of brilliance but have to sit through painfully average and directionless tracks."Movie Theme" is possibly the greatest track Beck's made in the past ten years, kind of like what Radiohead may have sounded like if they covered "Pay No Mind (Snoozer)" on to "Kid A." Nigel's classic production shines on this particular track. So yes, there is highlights. "1000bpm" shows that Beck's creativity has not ended and songs like "Think I'm in Love" and "Strange Apparition" show that Beck can make the catchy pop song. Then there's funky stuff like "Cellphone's Dead" that shows that the funky hip-hop of "Hell Yes" from the last album was no fluke. The first two thirds of "The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton" are pretty good, but the last track seems like such a waste of space of the album.The other tracks range from decent to forgettable and mediocre. What's disappointing about most of the mediocre tracks is they SOUND good but then when it gets to the climax or chorus, the song goes nowhere. Hopefully it will end up growing on me and I'll find out I'm wrong, but time hasn't told me that just yet. Most of the unmentioned tracks are not bad but still feel like filler. Also, some of the songs go on longer than they needed to. So, I think if the album was cut down, it would be amazing.

You know, it's kind of ironic, my experience with this group. I thought of 'em as a real head-scratcher band when I heard "Loveless" a couple years ago, one of the first times I realized that "indie" music wouldn't come to me as easily as I had initially thought. However, there was a romantic overtone and nice tunes that fascinated me at the same time and while I don't think it's 5-star good, this album sort of warmed me up to it.It's a pretty solid album throughout. It's not the overproduced experiment of "Loveless," but rather, more them making pop songs in the vein of Jesus and Mary Chain. They still have their own identity though. Feedback rules over "All I Need." My favorite two songs are "Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)" and "No More Sorry," which showed that they had genious in them before their highly praised swan song. I wish I enjoyed the second half as much as the first, but it's alright.

The Velvet Underground were always something different and special. The first album, even by today's standards, was pretty innovative and artistic, and the second album is the more shocking and more avant-garde of the two. It's also the least digestible VU album, as it's not as catchy as "Loaded," melodic as the self-titled record, or as song-for-song standout-ish as the debut. Even today, this record is menacing and scary, and still pretty unique. It may take some time for you to appreciate, as it is certainly an acquired taste.The tracks get even more detailed into drugs, particularly the likes of cocaine, in the first track. That's one of the greatest songs on this album, and while there's six songs, there is so much that's accomplished on here. I wish John Cale had sung on more VU songs. I thought he was a great vocalist, particularly on "Lady Godiva's Operation." It is brilliant and worth owning "White Light" for this alone. It is such a beautiful song.Although, on the other side of the spectrum is the infamous seventeen-minute jam-out track "Sister Ray," which is kinda scary, and totally dark and sinister. This track can be seen as one that paved the way for goth and noise rock. It is actually pretty well done and even at its incredibly long length, I think it's just fine. Well performed.As for the other three songs, they're a little bit interesting, even if not as noteworthy. The only one I'm not a really big fan of out of those is "The Gift," which goes the entire time through a poetic spoken word verses. I guess it's not bad, but not my type of thing.This record is interesting, and if you're in for it, I totally would suggest getting this sophomore album from the Velvet Underground.

This one's pretty much flawless. The band's fifth LP and it still stands up as my favorite, which isn't to discredit the others. I enjoy all the Jade Puget-era AFI records. Yes, evenSing the SorrowandDecemberundergroundare albums that I love. And if you haven't caught up with older AFI, this and theAll Hallow's EPare great choices to begin with. It is amazing how the group has progressed. I bet if I first heard this group throughAnswer That and Stay Fashionableand/orVery Proud of Ya, I would've never known that they had the ability to make something that sounds so good as this.Every song is awesome. The intro, "Initiation," kind of reminds me of NIN's "Help Me I Am in Hell" in the beginning, until the track's distortion and other instruments start kicking in. What a nice introduction. Even hints at their industrial influence are here, as on the rhythm breakdown on "The Despair Factor." The first three full songs are pretty good, but just about everything AFTER that blows those out of the water. Tracks 5-10 is one of my favorite album sequences. I sometimes repeat this part of the album because I like that part so much. You get some nice hardcore guitar riffs on "Smile" and if you're into their new stuff, you'll like the catchy "Days of the Phoenix." Davey Havok writes some pretty interesting lyrics. There are quite a bit of mid-tempo tracks on this album, which is about half of the tracks. There's the Offspring-ish "whoa-oh"s through many of the songs, and most of it will have the mmph to catch you on to this one.I practically recommend this to people who are new to AFI, and the one's who've been into them for awhile, well they probably own this already. People who don't really know what the band's about should give this a try; it may change their opinion of the band. This is proof that the band was much more than a fad, and are not just scene, they get their popularity because the fans love them so much. For a good reason -- their music is amazing.

Wow. To be honest, I'm late to the whole Refused bug. "The Shape of Punk to Come" may have been from 1998, but I was not interested in this type of music at the time and didn't even know they existed for another 2-3 years. And from then, the things I heard about them were all positive. And then I was getting into (post)-hardcore, which was where my interest began. I listened to "New Noise" because I heard it was their "classic" tune. I didn't even acquire it until a couple months ago(!)That being said, I am impressed. The album title is 100% apt, and it's rare for this to happen in punk. While many artists may sing about anti-conformity, several of the bands in the ilk sound similar, and then adding a guitar solo will sometimes be used to make the songs actually stand out. But Refused are a totally different kind of breed. They are kind of like Fugazi, they are punk rockers but they've got all the integrity and creativity that's beyond what some may predict it to be.Out of all 12 of these songs, not one of these is weak. The awesome electronic instrumental "Brutist Pome #5" is even a highlight on here. The tracks flow in amazingly well and the whole thing was well-written. There is mostly yelling on the album, however, this is not too much of a bad thing, as Dennis also speaks and at times actually will sing, like on the excellent "Summerholidays vs. Punkroutine," a track about the idea of maybe going big. It contains the album's greatest line: "rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in," which in itself should've been seen as a kind of anthem.Things kick off with speaking, and while it says how classics go out of style, I don't think this will ever be "out of style" for the underground. The lyrics on that track, "Worms of the Senses/Faculties of the Skull," are clearly anti-capitalist, and even though I am not really the most politically-minded, the lyrics are intellegent and that's what drives me to it. NOFX are boring compared to these guys, even if these guys aren't as humorous or anything. At the end of the track there is a "radio station" coming in with this "futuristic" electronic music in the background. That fades out and then you get into "Liberation Frequency," a track that is addictive on here. And throughout, there are ohter interesting moments, like the awesome rhythm section highlighted on the jazzy "Deadly Rhythm," the marching drums of "Protest Song '69," and better yet, the killer riff and memorable tune of my personal favorite, "Refused Are F***ing Dead." Later in the album there's even a bit of orchestral instruments, which is interesting to hear in this sort of album. It is musically interesting, and I wonder what took me so long to get this.This chimerical bombination is something I confidentally call a favorite of mine, even though I haven't even owned it that long. It inspired me recently to buy "The EP Compilation" which I saw at a store (!) and I loved that one, too. I may even try out some (International) Noise Conspiracy. This is an album in which the greatness is the least questionable thing.

I'll have to admit something: I'm not a huge Pearl Jam fan. In fact, I used to dislike them for a long time. But then I finally heard stuff back from "Ten" and enjoyed that, and while I can tolerate most of their albums, there's nothing that really makes me want to listen the whole way through, though a few moments come close. Don't get me wrong: I have nothing but respect for PJ. Even though its fans can be pompous and self-righteous.It covers 33 songs, and probably every one you're familiar with, as well as ones you may not be. My favorites on here are "Immortality," "rearviewmirror," "Do the Evolution," and of course, "Black." There are quite a bit of really good songs on the album. I guess I can see why people enjoy them, although on album I feel that they perhaps take themselves too seriously, and have the overall impression that the mid-90's stuff gets a bit pretentious. The lyrics are usually great as well, and they are talented, even if its fans overestimate it.There are a few tracks I dislike, however. I always have thought "Even Flow" was awful, partially because of the annoying way Vedder presents his vocals and uninteresting chord progression. "Better Man" is a boring and sub-par track and not even close to one of the better moments on "Vitalogy." "Who You Are" is a bit too hippy-ish for my tastes and I don't care to decipher the lyrics. I always thought "Yellow Ledbetter" was too self-indulgent and bland to really do anything for me, in spite the fact that it also gets a lot of airplay still.However, the good definitely outweighs the bad here, and I think it works well for casual/fairweather fans like myself. It was interesting to hear the new remixes of the "Ten" songs, and hear "Once" begin with the actual song. I don't even feel the need to listen to a lot of the albums as often because of the feeling that a lot of the best stuff is on here.

There is quite a bit of lackluster things happening right now in hip-hop and it seems like an artist like 50 Cent is ready to capitalize on it because he can. I enjoyed his previous album, his producers are a lot more talented than he is here, and this album DEFINES "style over substance". Where lines on his first album were clever and catchy they are afterthought at best on 'The Massacre'. Instead of making an artistic statement, 50 would rather make a meaningless album with songs that are either cheesy in the vein of "Baltimore Love Thing" or generic sex garbage in the vein of "Candy Shop", which is a re-write of "Magic Stick" which he made with Lil' Kim a couple years ago. Oh, but it's not the exact same song, so no one will notice. Then there's crap like materialism, which never really impressed me. Or vile, or name-dropping other artists so that we'll care. The fact that he made 22 of these songs is near inexcusible. I mean, the beats are great, but there is more than beats. The songs I like are only songs I like because of their beats and not much from 50's uninteresting flow and lyrics. I say that you could skip this one. He does have backlash but it's for a very good reason.Even though I say that there's a lot of flaws, there is also more than a handful of current hip-hop that I would say is a better choice. The Game's album is better than either of his and look at the other albums Dre produced.

It's been five and a half years since the unfairly maligned 'The Fragile', which I can honestly say basically changed my direction of musical taste permanently. Reznor has been known to make ground-breaking music with honest emotion, and so now comes to his latest, 'With Teeth'. Unlike any other release it doesn't break nearly as much ground and is the simplest thing made since 'pretty hate machine' and 'broken', but even that broke new ground.The new NIN record has both its highlights and lowlights. It does have a great one-two punch on the low-key, trip-hop influenced "All the Love in the World", which shows Trent doing everything he does the best. It's got a great falsetto and piano solo to boot with that. Then comes in Dave Grohl's machine-like drum delivery in "You Know What You Are", along with a cool sound that reminds me of drum-n-bass that comes before the verses. Although this shows that Trent has kind of reverted from 'The Fragile' and is less mature that is fine enough in this case.Other highlights here include the almost Dandy Warhols-sounding "Sunspots", although that's only in the riffs becuase Reznor's voice kind of splits a difference and he hasn't gotten done saying "nothing can stop me now". "The Line Begins to Blur" is straight-out synth stuff from NIN, and gets stuck in your head for awhile. "With Teeth" is a great song that had to do with overcoming his battle with alcohol and heroin, with nice instrumentation. It's one of the more memorable NIN moments. It also gets real nice in its conclusion of "Right Where It Belongs", with great lines like "What if everything you know is just an elaborate dream?". It's a nice piano track and shows that Reznor is still skilled at that thing and it doesn't shy away the Bowie-type stuff he's been doing since 'The Downward Spiral'.I suppose if you want an album with the 'hits', this is a good place to start. There are catchy numbers like "The Hand That Feeds", the nice riffage of "Getting Smaller" and "The Collector" is one of the most accessible NIN tracks.This album does have its flaws. There are some real lyrical missteps. Look at "Only": "I just pick you up/to hurt myself/there's no f**king you/there is only me". This shows that Reznor's maturity seems to have reverted from the last time and the lyrics on 'The Fragile' were great. The remainder songs don't really stand out much.I actually think this is a really good record, but the more I like an artist, the more constructively critical I get with the artist. I believe NIN are best when creating ground-breaking opuses, and this doesn't sound anything like that. As much as I hate saying it, it's easily the most commerical thing NIN has ever done. I guess that's what is dissapointing is that that's not what some would wait five-and-a-half years for. At any rate though I am really interested in what he does and I hope it sounds more on-target for someone who has already approched 40. Either way I hope he has more ambition and ideas for the next release, but at least this is decent.

For a few years or so I have been a big NIN fan. I don't think I like it as much as "The Downward Spiral" or "The Fragile," but "PHM," Trent's first album out to the market, is a wonderfully done synth-pop album. In some ways, it is interesting historically. It's not as noisy or abrasive as anything from Skinny Puppy or Ministry, yet there is an edge here. Also, Trent adds in personal lyrics, something somewhat rare for the genre, which was more about its musical machines and political rants. Even when Trent does get political, as on "Head Like a Hole," the energy is raw and the track is amazing, probably my favorite on the album. The rest of the album is not as loud, although it does get heavy on parts of "Kinda I Want To" and the noisy parts of "Ringfinger." 7 out of the 10 songs are pretty much perfect. The three that aren't are still noteworthy and stand out, including those last two I mentioned. Another one, "That's What I Get," is charming because of how simple and amateurly done it is (in a completely non-embarassing way). It also has this cool Eastern feel in the music, and the minimalism never seemed so good.Other highlights are sly humor and awesome slap bass in "The Only Time," which has some nice industrial keyboards in the end of the choruses. "Something I Can Never Have" reminds me of a Depeche Mode ballad, except, where Gore would usually sing on a song like "Somebody," Trent is singing of his anxieties and has a totally different tone in the voice. "Sanctified" is also standout-ish in the bass and minimalism. "Down In It" works well with its spoken, sad lyrics and beats/noises. "Sin" is a dark number that makes this album worth owning possibly. The structure makes it a well-done song and is another example of dark pop on the album.If you like the new album, "With Teeth" a lot, I think you would also enjoy this album. "Broken" is more angry and "The Downward Spiral" is much more scary, but this still stands out on its own. Some of it will have you wanting to dance and such, but it is a reason why I love NIN so much, and many people seem to still find this as a highlight of NIN, so I'd say that now that it's available in the U.S. again, go ahead and get it.

Being a fan of industrial/EBM, I hadn't actually gotten to buying a Front album until this, "Front by Front", which is backed with the "Never Stop!" EP and the original "Headhunter" version, found in its single (all on the Epic reissue). I had actually heard some of their songs before, but didn't actually buy until I found it for a rather good price. That being said, it turned out to be really good.The beginning just confirms that, "Until Death (Us Do Part)". A rather catchy track and one that you'll find yourself listening to the most, it gives the album a sort of appeal.There are also tracks which are mostly instrumental, like the religious samples of "Welcome to Paradise" or mostly on "Work 01" (great intro sample) and on most of "Blend the Strengths".Sometimes it is the samples that make it, and sometimes it's the song itself. I'm sure if you're looking here at all that you know the song "Headhunter". The synth line is addictive and so is its chorus. It doesn't need to be explained by EBM fans why this is considered a classic, and the bridge is brilliant. Nearly five minutes of fun, I'm glad they have two versions of it on this album. That should be a reason enough to convince someone to buy this that's just a casual fan.Honestly, there are sometimes when I don't feel like listening to this. But, in spite that, I think it's very good. I can't decide whether I prefer this or "Tyranny", as they've both got their moments in spite the fact that I wouldn't call either one of my "favorites". Still, I might look more into the Front 242 catalog, as I enjoy listening to lots from them.

But that's like saying that a Coldplay song is fast or something. All of the previous studio albums from this artist were all masterpieces. While this is not one, it is good on its own right. In fact if it were from any other artist I would've given it another star, but I'm kind of a snob on stuff like this. Hearing that the Pumpkins were reuniting recently, I wanted to discuss this.It definitely has its moments. There's nice epic stuff like the three-part gothic "Glass and the Ghost Children" and there's nice pop songs in "Stand Inside Your Love", which shows that there is great musicianship and in songs like "Raindrops + Sunshowers" and "Wound", it's done straightforward but for all of the right reasons. Billy's emotion shines in the latter, although admittedly, his voice annoyed me on this album more easily than the others. Actually, his voice doesn't even annoy me that often.One thing they needed to know is that they didn't need distortion to be goth on 'Adore', so they didn't need to be here. Also, the tracks aren't really as return-to-form as they promised to be at the time, but since some people are Jimmy purists they are too blind to see where all the merits in the Pumpkins lied. That's not to say he's not a great drummer, although on this album it's not as appearant as on the first three Pumpkin records. The distortion gets annoying on "Heavy Metal Machine", which should be just three minutes and not six, which makes it unlistenable. It also makes really good songs like "Blue Skies Bring Tears" harder on the ears.Hopefully the return of the Pumpkins will see them relying on the strengths more than the weaknesses, because this is really the only flawed studio record from the Pumpkins.Check out Machina II. It's actually a bit better than this one. Not available commercially but contains some great songs like "Glass' Theme" and "Dross" that did not get included here.

You know, there are a lot of people I know who dislike U2 and Bono, but the more I listen to "Achtung Baby," the more I wonder how that's even possible. Seriously. They did a post-punk band in their first three albums, the next two (plus the half-studio "Rattle") showing them in an anthemic stadium rock sort band, and here's the one where they seem to be having a lot of fun. In my opinion, '90's U2 is vastly underappreciated, both by the band and its fans. However, this is easily the greatest of the three released in that decade (and I'm a big "Pop" fan, mind you).But these songs are timeless, inventive, and just wow-inducing. Not a single bad song in this bunch of twelve songs. It's most known possibly for the classic ballad "One," a sort of sad track but also a very moving one. There is a passion in there that makes it timeless."Zoo Station," "The Fly," and "Mysterious Ways" are some of U2's heaviest songs, and they are so in an industrial way. It's got electronics but isn't quite techno in either case. It's almost got a dark sound, something I wouldn't have expected out of U2's earlier output. Even after hearing "MW" several times, I am still amazed at its sonic genius, from that opening Edge riff which is hard to imitate.Then the last three tracks are all incredible, too. "Ultraviolet" is such a melodious and touching track, while "Love Is Blindess" is a perfect way to end the album, a great chillout track, and "Acrobat" is another one of U2's greatest songs.U2 were a lot of things on here -- edgy, inventive, yet simple enough to connect with the masses. While Nirvana may have turned the world to alternative rock with their album in the same year, U2 were showing its next evolution. Recommended to everyone who's willing to listen to some U2. All 12 songs are great.

Well, there are reasons why "A Broken Frame" is worth owning (see the cover art?) and at the same time, reasons why you may not want to buy the album. It all depends on what you go for. This is my least favorite DM album, but it's not really that bad. It's good, but not consistently great. If you prefer the early synth-pop sound, you might like this one. If you like DM's more sophisticated and complex works, I'd avoid this one like the plague. I also don't know if a fan of the more rock-style "Songs of Faith and Devotion" would be big on this.That being said, it's neither as catchy as the work that had Vince Clarke on "Speak & Spell" and it was before classics like "Some Great Reward," "Black Celebration," and "Violator." I try giving the band the benefit of the doubt since this was before they fully realized their potential. That being said, "ABF" is kind of a weird DM album. I used to not get why people laughed at DM, but with more "experimental" tracks like "Monument", I sort of get it. It's not that bad however. The worst stuff on here is either bland or not that memorable, the best stuff has qualities that make DM worth it. Some of it is unexplored DM territory. Other than the aforementioned song there is also the dub beats of "Sattellite" and songs like "My Secret Garden" are not very DM-like at all. But that's all that Gore's forefront to DM had changed in them.The album's two best songs are the last two. "Shouldn't Have Done That" is a great track with Dave and Martin singing in unison, beautiful and with interesting lyrics. "The Sun and the Rainfall" is a fan favorite and once I hear that Alan Wilder (not with the band during the recording, but by the time touring came for the album) wanted to perform with DM at one fo the tours. The synths are great on that one and are more timeless than most others. "Nothing to Fear" is a nice instrumental track, much better than the boring one on "Speak." Buy this if you love DM or prefer a more early-80's synth sound.However, if you're new to the band, I'd buy "Catching Up"/"The Singles 81>85" in favor before checking this thing out. The cassette and vinyl versions of the album don't have the filler "Further Excerpts from: My Secret Garden" or the extended "Leave in Silence" (the original version is on instead). Those two were actually B-sides that ended up on the CD version of the album.

The first three DM albums are okay, but most of the time from here on, works put in perspective the band's actual potential. The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, "Broken Frame" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and "Construction Time"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.23 years later, people can probably still identify with "Some Great Reward." Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in "It Doesn't Matter," "Stories of Old," and "Somebody." 2 of the 3 selections are sung by Martin. "IDM" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on "Stories of Old," possibly my favorite from the record. "Somebody" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track.That doesn't mean the other 6 songs aren't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is "Lie to Me," and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with "Something to Do," one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit "People Are People." The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen.Then there's the awesome Wilder composition "If You Want." The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) "Master and Servant" and "Blasphemous Rumors." "Master" starts with a trade-off a cappella with Martin and Dave saying "it's a lot," ending it with "like life." It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in "Blasphemous Rumors," which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'80's, and rightfully so. Totatlly worth the cheap price, or if you want the re-mastered sound, you could go for the CD/DVD version.

Well, Joy Division have to be one of the greatest bands that ever lived. This retrospective shows some of that. I was a huge fan of their studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, as well as the half-"outtake"/half-live album Still, which I consider their most overlooked release. The only JD which you truly don't need is Permanent, I'll never understand that one.As for this one, it contains two tracks from the out-of-print debut EP, which is a pleasant surprise for fans like me who didn't get exposed to JD in their time (well, I've been for only three years). It begins with the classic track "Warsaw", as well as the fact that singles like "Atmosphere" appear here, where classics you can find elsewhere of the band, like Unknown Pleasure's "She's Lost Control". This one, along with Still, makes me wonder what they would have done, but New Order were pretty good even if not as consistently as this band.Ian Curtis was one of my favorite vocals. It's distinctive of other vocalists, and the emotion could be heard in it. My favorite Joy Division tracks, "Love Will Tear Us Apart" and "Dead Souls" are here. The latter has a classic bass line, and Bernard Sumner's riffs are really awesome. It's no big surprised that NIN would later cover it, seeing as the riff sounds something like what Trent Reznor would be influenced by. You shouldn't have to read lame/cheesy reviews like this to know why they are one of the greatest acts I've heard. Buying and listening will be the work needed. I honestly have never encountered a person in real life who didn't like this band.

And one that was ground-breaking as well. It must've been shocking for the people who actually did follow all of Ministry's stuff in the '80s. The classic synth-pop singles "Cold Life" and "Everyday is Halloween", the more dated stuff of "With Sympathy", and then with "Twitch," Ministry became a Front 242-type industrial group, with a lot of techno elements and movie sampling. Then there's "The Land of Rape and Honey" which is nothing like anything done before from Ministry. I've got the domestic cassette version that doesn't include "Hizzbollah" or "I Prefer", but it still shines in that version. "Stigmata" is one of the greatest songs ever made, Ministry's shining moment. The main riff is kinda like a buzzsaw, the drums rule, and Al's distinctive vocals give it a totally unique feel. I kept on repeating this track when I got the album.There's plenty left to explore, though. For the ones who like the heavy stuff from Ministry, we've got "The Missing" and "Deity", predecessors for the "Psalm 69"-era Ministry. There's still a bunch of sampling going on with this release, especially with "Golden Dawn", which has an addictive bass in it. "The Land of Rape and Honey" and "Flashback" are two other classics on the album; those and "Stigmata" make this album worth the price. The former is a standard industrial great and the latter is a fun techno-punk-thrash type song, with some classic manic lyrics: "I'm gonna rip her flesh/I'm gonna p*ss in her face/I'm gonna rip her open/then hit her with mace". Then the ending track is a nice instrumental track that makes the end of the album worthwhile. You'll enjoy it most likely if you truly like industrial.While Al may be retiring the Ministry project soon, he'll be remembered by self-respecting industrial fans for albums he did between "Twitch" and "Psalm 69," and for some even "Filth Pig." Oh, and that reviewer below me only really likes metal snob stuff so it doesn't really matter what he says (not to get into his stupid elaboration of what someone listens to).

You know that song, "Down in It" by Nine Inch Nails, where he speaks to where it's almost in a rap, and there's lots of industrial noises on the chorus, etc? Well, that song _is_ included here in the form that also appears on the album. An entertaining song to say the least. I am just as big of a NIN fan as anyone else out there, but the TVT singles were really nothing to sneeze at. Especially "Down in It"'s single.What makes this not worth owning? Well, others have explained that already. Besides, the remixes are boring, repetitive, and too long. If you are a halo collector, I guess you can get this. If you like the original "Down in It" and don't know if you want to get "Pretty Hate Machine" (a highly recommended album), I guess this too. But I feel that this single doesn't have the merit of the later ones like "Closer to God" and "March of the Pigs", truly great NIN singles.

Let's face it, fans of the artist: While NIN has a lot of worthy material, the "Pretty Hate Machine" singles were only made for completists. Where others sometimes had authentic B-sides/covers, and actual interesting remixes, this was from a time when "interesting" and "remix" were an oxymoron.I'm not a big fan of remixes, and I'll admit that the majority of the rest of the disc is very average, especially coming from NIN. "Get Down Make Love" raises the thing up a star. It's a pretty good cover of Queen that does not try to ape Queen. This song is the only thing that most people usually mention on the single, too. There are also three uninteresting remixes of "Sin", but I sort of like that "dub" mix. It's nice to think of "Sin" as a dub song. I am not a purist who hates this song being turned into a dance song, as I think it could have been worse. But if you must buy a single from this era, I must direct you to "Head Like a Hole". "The Downward Spiral" era was the only real time when the singles were worth owning, save the occasional exception. Besides, if you bought it, well... you bought it and it's there for something. And having just 4 tracks cannot be too bad.

In the return of Gravity Kills, it seems four years has given them a little maturity, despite sounding a little "starved". I think that it has to do with how they left their record label and wanted another, while Kurt Kerns, the band's original drummer, left the band.. Well, late 2000 was when GK were offered a deal for major label Sanctuary. It was months later that they agreed. It has a different sound, but all GK albums kind of do. With the debut album, it was a great use of electronica, industrial, rock, and a little punk influence added. It was like commercial KMFDM, but it was still from TVT.They followed with Perversion, a noncommercial version of the debut. Both albums had one ballad. Superstarved really doesn't.It's their heaviest, even though some songs aren't. It begins with "Love, Sex, and Money", a track which has a heavy intro and then has a cool synth arrangement. The techno part of the song stands it out. Otherwise I wouldn't like it too much."Take it All Away" is one of the standouts on the album. It has use of a sitar, and is just well-played. I love Jeff's deep voice on the song. It somewhat sounds like a covet-relationship song. "You wanted to much from all of me, I wanted to much from everything I need"There are other songs that aren't really that heavy. But most of it is."Breakdown" is my personal favorite song here. It begins with guitar lines that sound somewhat familiar and dives into a futuristic riff, then Brad Booker's nice drumming. It's fast and catchy (the drumming)."Forget Your Name" is the most intersting one. "everything's fake and nothing is real" with some other lines, but it's also the cool production Martin Atkins gave, along with the nice playing."Superstarved" is kind of the break-up sounding song. "a sillhouette of me is all you wanna see", and the song is still intense a little. I love the bass lines to the song. And the part that sounds Ministry-esque."ls&m; reprise" is a standout instrumental. It's Pitchshifter-esque, a good thing. Even though it's only 2:08 long. The song is too good for any word whatsoever to describe. Whereas "Forward" was like an intro to "Hold" or the full album (self-titled), "ls&m;" is like an outro, or looking at the title, to track one, "Love sex and money"."One thing" has great lyrics that are about the way the band were looking forward to still making music. I love the music, too.On "Fifteen Minutes", another standout, it has a great guitar line in the pre-chorus. It features backing vocals from Matt Dudenhoeffer, for those who dont know, the guitarist.Overall i like the lyrics the best on this one, but musically, I like the first two. While there's still no filler, I'm not a big fan of "enemy", but it's decent. If there's any heavy album from this year to buy, it's this one. I will admit that I'm a modern rock fan who likes the first two better. However, this still is, and maybe next time they'll be fine and it'll be even better. They did give me faith in rock music.

I recently re-acquainted myself with Coldplay's sophomore LP. I remember whenever it was first out, I felt it was one of the better things around, especially because I hated most of what was coming out when this was big. And while not on par with classic Radiohead, it is a wonderful record. Elitists generally like to laugh at people who listen to this band, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of them secretly are humming to their songs at times. Yes, the music's simple and so are the lyrics, it's not edgy and not particularly innovative. But does that mean it's never good?Nope, it's got enough highlights to keep you interested. "The Scientist" and "Clocks" are classic Coldplay tracks; the former with sincerity in its execution and the other one with an awesome piano hook. The title track is a melodic track about modern events, and an underrated track is the beautiful "Green Eyes," and it makes you wonder why there weren't more acoustic type songs on the record.There are a couple of kind of low-light tracks. "Daylight" is too much musically like the track before it to be interesting enough and "Warning Sign" doesn't particularly do anything for me.However, the good outweighs the bad on this record. I actually like the other two albums a little bit more, but I still recommend "Rush." You could get sick of it after awhile, I may warn you however.

Honestly, the singer-songwriter artists are something I have to be in the right mood for. I find a lot of those of today to be kind of bland and typical, with a few who stand out. One that does stand out to me, fortunately, is Pete Yorn. He adds some kind of rhythmic flavor to his songs as well as the down-to-earth instrumentation, as well as the fact that his songs are all catchy and melodic, totally memorable. He's an interesting songwriter, as well.The album does bring me good memories of back in my freshman year of high school, when the album was sort of getting its push. I heard it at a store I went to frequently (I basically lived there, even as the window shopper I was then), and was blown away by most of it. The melodies are beautiful and the songs are well-crafted pop tunes. I really like the beginning track "Life on a Chain," as well as most of the songs, really. "Just Another" kind of has both a happy and sad feeling. Songs like "Black," the U2-like "For Nancy" (the album's biggest hit) and "Murray" up the ante a little bit, with more of the quirky distortion in the mix. My favorite track is probably "Sense," but there's nothing quite like a chorus of "Is something wrong with me?" being its first line. That grabs the listener's attention. There are 14 songs and one hidden track, and there's no filler here.I haven't heardhis new recordyet, but I really like this one, and evenDay I Forgotto a lesser extent. It is usually pretty nicely priced and the music stands out well, so I recommend this.

Okay, I know what some may think, but I am NOT in fact a Weezer purist. I think thatWeezer (Green Album)is an incredible record and thatMake Believeisn't too far behind either, for instance. However, those songs had more memorable songs and didn't have to get bogged down by ugly-sounding distortion. I know that sometimes it can make for a good thing, but to me that really is the album's big Achilles.As some may expect there is some quality stuff on "Maladroit." My favorite song is the single "Keep Fishin'" which writes in love but in a way that you came to love Rivers' songwriting. It's probably the song that people remember and come back to the most from the album. I also really like "Take Control" and while its distortion bugs me the rest of the song is really solid. It actually comes off as a full-fledged track and doesn't bury the goods from the mix. Plenty of songs are pretty decent, even if you've heard more than just pretty decent from the group.They seemed to really care about what the critics were saying. I mean, I know they've used hard rock riffs before but they feel like they want to convince the world they're doing that on this album. And after long enough it wears the listener to hear such a thing. It looks like many of the Weezer snobs of old didn't like this turn in direction either, and for once I must grudgingly admit to agreeing with them. Half of the songs are not really tuneful in the least and just sound like a jam out session gone very wrong. If I don't hear another Weezer album like this I think I'll be fine. Rivers really jumps the ship here, but it was recovered later.I recommend it if you're looking to complete Weezer in your collection but I don't suggest it to any casual fans. It's not even one of the better remembered records from Weez and there is a good reason for that as well.

This was probably my second Front 242 album, after "Front by Front". And actually it was only like a year ago that I had bought that one. This one stands out as well. While not actually perfect it is way above average. Some tracks do admittedly either drag a bit or stuff like that, but the good outweighs the bad (not that bad) in many ways.I have to say that my favorite song on the record is "Tragedy for You". That synth line is just hypnotic, and the vocals are rather unique. It never gets old, no matter how many times I repeat it. The album also starts out great with "Sacrifice", which will satisfy most EBM fans. So will this record. I also really enjoy "Trigger 2 (Anatomy of a Shot)". It is quite a good record.So, even after going on to a major label, Front 242 are very much themselves. I think it is a great buy if you like industrial and EBM. It's one of my favorite styles of music so I'm glad to have them. And if you only heard "Pulse" and don't think you like them, you may want to try this album instead.

Or at least that's what I think. It seems that for most people, when they realized that the minimally talented Limp Bizkit was going to rock bottom (the twin embarrassments "Chocolate Starfish..." and "Results") and heard Linkin Park, it connected to many as a good alternative to that. And for others, well there's lots of sounds that connected. For many people it was a good soundtrack to teenage angst. I still am, but I prefer a band called Violent Femmes for that. I don't mind the album or anything, but I don't actually think it's perfect or anything.That's not to say there isn't any good songs here; many of them are decent. And it really could be worse. While they are arguably the most mainstream band of their contemporaries, they also can make songs that are structured musically and make sense, which connects to people. It sold so many copies, and when not played to death, I really do enjoy "Crawling" and "In the End". Both show a great Depeche Mode influence as well as being pretty decent songs. Even I don't really like the tracks where Chester screams that much. Don't get me wrong, the Dillinger Escape Plan is one of my favorite bands and screams in like all of their songs. It's just the way it is done, it sounds so pubescent or something to me. It makes it sound like a teenybop version of what they're doing.As for the rest of the band, what stands out is what Mr. Hahn does in tracks like "Cure for the Itch", although it's pretty much just made to show off his skills. He has some pretty good ideas; unfortunately they rarely go throughout the songs. "Papercut" is fairly good, even though Chester sounds a lot like Fred Durst, but does it quite decently for being in a bad comparison. So, while it's not perfect you could do a lot worse. I had to check it out because of some NIN/DM influence, and those are some of my favorite artists. But it's also very probable that you will like it.

Well, the only thing that I can say to reviews below is that arguing that James Iha wasn't a song-writer is nothing short of erroneous. I was actually one of the people who didn't care how the lineup of a "reunited" band would turn out since it wasn't like Iha and Darcy Wretzky would want to come back anyway. Now I've got that out of the way. The record, apart from being credited as a Smashing Pumpkins release for the first time in seven years, is not particularly extraordinary. The interesting thing is that while the guitars are back, it sounds more like Queens of the Stone Age with Billy singing than the actual first two Smashing Pumpkins releases.While I don't think it holds a candle to the first four albums, it is in many ways superior to the scattershotMACHINA/The Machines of Godand the songs are pretty well put together. It may seem like a crowd pleaser to some, as the more "rock" songs tend to be in the first half and more of the keyboard-laced songs are toward the end. And truth be told there is some pretty good moments. I hear that "That's the Way (My Love Is)" will be the album's next single and on top of being catchy is a great pop type song from Corgan.Perhaps the centrepice of the record though is "United States." It is the longest song on the record and perhaps all for the better. The riffage reminds me of the psychedelic hard rock of older releases. Another great highlight on the record is the gorgeous closer "Pomp and Circumstance," which to me, is aural bliss, like a song that must have come from heaven. Not that it's my favorite song from them, but it gives you that sort of feel. There is a sort of political undercurrent to the record and it's one thing that did make me a bit skeptical. However, it seems that Billy can make anything sound like a personal record which is one reason this works fine for some of the fans.On the downside, I wonder if the release was a bit rushed, something I never thought I'd be saying about a Pumpkins release. It seems like more is put to the tracks. That being said for the first time sinceGishhas an album come out that wouldn't make an ADD-diagnosed listener pass out. That being said, the ambition was always one of Billy Corgan's strengths and his heart gave the songs their feel, showing the band did in fact have integrity.Another let down is that some of the "bonus" tracks on other releases are actually better than at least half of the songs on this record, which makes me wonder if Billy's learned from the mistakes of seven years ago. This also makes me hope for a commerical single release or something. And while this didn't have me holding my breath, something like releasing "Mashed Potatoes" commercially would do that trick. That being said it's 2007, and Billy wants to play Smashing Pumpkins tracks again.

I remember first hearing the single &quot;Flake&quot;. It did absolutely nothing for me. However, I heard it two listens later, and as I paid attention to the lyrics, it helped me like it more. The last time something alike has happened to me was Pearl Jam's Vs. But this album is more jazz-ish or blues-ish than that, yet does have a rocking point as well. My favorite of the tracks is probably &quot;Middle Man&quot;, the song I got stuck in my head the longest from this album. it's the most enjoyable thing on here.The tracks have certain ways they are. They could be easier songs to get into, with a feel of the album, which sometimes seems refreshing. Melodic, too. They also sometimes seem reggae-influenced, sort of like Ben Harper. Of the thirteen tracks, Bushfire Fairytales seems to be a promising debut, even if I haven't fully gotten into it yet.I heard it at a store once, and knew I'd be interested in the album. The acoustic feel is also getting to grow on me more and more by each listen. It's also refreshing that Modern Rock radio is playing Johnson quite a bit. I like it more for the lyrics than music for right now, but I'd recommend it. If you like this, you may also like John Mayer and Ben Harper, other talented singer/songwriters.

And no, I'm not someone who hates rap. In general, I enjoy it. But it doesn't mean that there isn't something in every genre I listen to that doesn't suck. This being a good example. I'll admit, I liked most of his first album. Sure, it may have been overtly commercial, but at least the songs were both listenable and somewhat lyrically smart. This second album is a complete travesty, not only by comparison, but for any artist's standards. Really.Just look at the lyrics to the songs; they are all horrible. The music doesn't sound too much better, either. Too many tracks and the only halfway-decent song is "#1" and that's not even good enough of a song for me to be convinced to buy an album. In fact, I thankfully didn't. Instead, I listened to my sister's copy. It's catchy, but that doesn't mean that anything else about it is good. I mean, I like listening to records that have actual depth/substance. The subsequent albums were probably flops because some people actually had to live with the bad taste of this record. Try something else, almost anything else.

I know, I told you in early 2002 that it was great. But at that time I was also like 14 or 15. In years to come, I've listened to this again in occasion, and I realize that it is not really the wonderful album I though it was. Oh, and now since I'm 18 I've heard so many other albums that things put it in perspective.But also, what many forget is that music is in fact subjective. That's why bands like this have a fan base. What the band lacks is made up for in good overall songs. Contrary to popular belief, I think people will compare anything angry that has keyboards to NIN, no matter how it sounds. The first time, it was partly faulted in production, which was done by the same guy who produced "PHM". This, the second GK album, while not perfect does have its moments.Sadly, you can sort of hear a lack of edginess, which can be blamed on the record label, TVT, which is why they left after this album. It's definitely got its moments. I like the more electronic tracks on the album. Particuarly with "Alive", which is really edgy, with heavy bass and drum. While the drums were simple, the song turned out to be a pretty good one. "Disintegrate" has a repetitive yet addictive synth riff. It makes the song, as does the verse beat. It also ends on a great note. While not really electronic, I particuarly do enjoy the rhythm of "Belief (to Rust)", which shows that some of the lyrics here are really great. It also surprisingly ends with some chimes.Some songs are in typical Gravity Kills formula, so if you wanted some of what you heard the first time around, there is some of that. "Drown" and "One" are good examples of this. Neither track is particularly spectacular. However, it does show a metal side to the band. Just don't expect any guitar solos or anything in Gravity Kills.But what makes it great is that while it's not completely talented, the songs themselves were written well enough and some of the members did show some talent. Doug Firley had some great keyboard lines and synth riffs while Jeff Scheel was a great singer, and in spite occasionally sounding like Trent when getting nasal, he was rather unique. As for the other two members, they don't get involved enough with their instruments, but I do like a lot of the drumming anyway. Although I still absolutely love the first album, this one is good but has some tracks that don't stand out quite as much. If you like what you know from Gravity Kills, I recommend it. If you don't, I can't guarantee that you'll like it.

After hearing so much about this band and not really knowing anything that they've actually done, I checked this out at a local public library. Well, this continues that current indie trend of the dance-punk. There is quite a bit of hi-hat used in most of the songs. It's also got lots of spoken word tracks as well. I feel that with this album that there isn't a whole lot to say, but even though it won't have much length, I can tell you that if you don't really mind the length of some of these songs that you might be okay. That has always been the problem with me: the songs seem to go on longer than necessary.There happen to be the highlights though, songs that stop the album from being just dragging. I particularly like the two versions of "Yeah" quite a bit. Something about those stand out quite a bit. Also, there's "Tribulations" on the first disc which is a standout track, complete with its synth that gives it a new-wave feel.So, yeah, that's all I can really say. It's not really awful by any stretch of the mind, although sometimes it's rather average. But it all depends on what you're looking for. If it's the dance-punk thing is for you, LCD Soundsystem is probably that too. It's decent, so I'm not gonna stop from recommending you this.

I tend to find that the people who don't like "Songs of Faith and Devotion" are in two categories: Electronic purists who are so set in their ways that DM doing a guitar based album is a travesty (although hints started with "Black Celebration"), people wrongfully accusing it as an attempt to stay relevant (followed "Violator" and most of these are songs that Pearl Jam and the likes never have & never will make). But beyond that, there isn't one single bad song on "SoFaD." It may take awhile to digest it though, I'll admit. It took awhile for me to get used to the "noir-gospel" of "Condemnation," but I now really love that song. The lyrics are not really embarassing, and "I Feel You" is one of Depeche Mode's greatest songs ever (that says a lot!). Another classic is the six-and-a-half minute "In Your Room." Martin Gore sings on a couple of slower-toned, orchestral tracks like the dark yet beautiful "Judas" and string-heavy "One Caress." Sure, the single version of "Walking in My Shoes" is better than the one on here, but that doesn't make this "not worth owning." Not only this, every song still sounds like Depeche Mode. The songs I didn't mention are still wonderful too, and I particularly like the punch of "Get Right with Me" and the pseudo-industrial "Rush." Gore is usually great when he writes the type of dark lyrics on this album, part of its greatness.In short: It's worth owning because it's a wonderful band at a creative peak, it's cheap, and even if the cover art is lackluster the music will help you overlook that (but I think that's why some people presumptively dismiss & mock the album). Hey, the first two albums have my favorite cover art and are my least favorites that the group did.

If you are a White Stripes fan who did not really feel the new record, I've gotta tell you something. If you do not own "Under Blackpool Lights" then I've gotta tell you to buy it because, for one thing, I really shouldn't have to need anything to back it up with, but if you really want to know why someone would, well here's why:It's got all of the stuff that the Stripes did before that album. Besides, there are some things that are worthy of being seen. I thought the guitar solo on the studio version of "Ball and Buscuit" was great, but listen to this on the DVD. It's amazing how it sounds on here. That is one of the reasons you should buy it.If you're a casual fan, don't worry. Even though Jack doesn't ever perform his stateside breakthrough, most of the hits are performed anyway. I really like the drum clicking of "The Hardest Button to Button" and the crowd seemed excited too. Also performed was easily their most popular song ever, "Seven Nation Army". It's performed basically how you'd expect. But then again, this live DVD was pretty much what I expected.Even when the electric piano is used like in "Apple Blossom" or the organs on "Truth Doesn't Make a Noise", he doesn't forget to rock with the guitar.You also get two Son House covers in a row (both faithful in that they are both done very bluesy), the great "Jolene" rendition (which you may have heard), as well as covers from obscure bands who only really were known in their local areas.There's also the big morph they have after the first two songs, which includes covers of Bob Dylan and Ledbetter. There's also two original Stripes songs in that mix as well as another cover.It did not thrill me like the Cure's "Trilogy" DVD, but nothing really does to be honest. It just gets a four because for whatever reason I feel that there was something missing, I don't really know what it was. I don't know if the DVD I had was the problem, but the sound quality was even a bit rough for my tastes in general. But I don't understand how you won't like this if you like the White Stripes.

Well, in a time of re-packaging an artist's backcatalog, it sometimes can be a nice ride. Depeche Mode have done so with giving us thirty-minute movies about the group at the time and giving audio parts of the DVD with out-takes from the album. Six years doesn't do a lot digitally to change the sound but if you want what's involved for the time, this was a good treat to the fans. The thing is, "Exciter" is an album I've ALWAYS felt was VERY unfairly hated. Sure, it's not like everything DM does, it's more minimal, etc., but if you are open minded about that kind of direction it may *actually* work for you.Six years later and I still can't get enough. Nearly half of the album is classic Depeche Mode, and that's considering when 2 of the songs are pretty much interludes. Admittedly I felt cheated when I learned that "Easy Tiger" wasn't just going to be released in its long form as a full song because I liked that one quite a bit. This re-release sort of makes a way to make up for the fact."Dream On," "The Sweetest Condition," "The Dead of Night," "Comatose," and "I Am You" are all five Depeche Mode classics. The latter is a great mix of acoustics and a trip-hop style beat. At times parts seem creepy and sinister in the instrumentation, but no one can deny the classic chorus. "The Sweetest Condition" may remind people of aViolatorsong with the same title, but I feel that they are unique enough from each other that it distinguishes. I love its romantic feel and it's also the same kind of feel in "I Am You." The song's so good that I think if I got married that I would consider that for the main music. It is very melodic and the romantic feel in every way matches this record and is something Depeche were always great with doing. "Comatose" pretty much lives up to its title; definitely unlike anything from the group but an excellent track which Gore himself sings. "The Dead of Night" is a real surprise. I can't blame people for not liking that song but it's a real winner with me, with its lyrics and its noisiness and everything else in it really matches together. I often find myself singing along with the pre-chorus, which shows that even when they may otherwise seem tuneless that they can even still be melodic.I didn't even get into "I Feel Loved" and "Goodnight Lovers," both singles and excellent songs, pretty close to being on par with the other five mentioned. The latter was later ripped off in its beat by Dirty Vegas in "Days Go By" but the songs also give different sorts of feels. The lyrics are pretty simple and the song is probably the most dance-y thing on the whole record. It proves that even when making mellow music you can have something with some real life in it. "Goodnight Lovers" is total aural bliss. The additional vocals make me feel like it's some soundtrack to heaven itself or something and even if the "soul sisters/soul brothers" lyric in the chorus feels forced to some it doesn't really even taint the song. It ends "Exciter" on the right note and a pretty high one.Admittedly they could have maybe taken off the somewhat pointless interlude "Lovetheme" and "Breathe" in spite its high Biblical references, is not a highly interesting song. Still tolerable, but it may have been better off as a B-side. Works well as filler in the album's context though.The other songs mentioned aren't bad, but I'd say they are standard fare for the band. Although many of those also give the album a relaxed feel. And just when you thought Gore sung all the slow love ballads you get Gahan singing on "Freelove," which is also offered in its single mix on the DVD of it. I admittedly like that one more but feel that the version on this album fits the feel of the album better.I feel that any real Depeche Mode fan should give this record a second spin. In spite some of the criticisms it's received it is still a pretty unique record and a mildly big suprise. After the darker and heavier two (still great) albums before it, the band got over some of its tensions and was finally able to write something with a different feel and a truly matured sounding Depeche record. In spite how mellow it is I don't find it boring in the least. It works a hypnotic feel good and after "Waiting for the Night" how could you NOT want that in an album. Oh, and you can tell by the title of a B-side where I got the name from, although I put a lame twist to it by spicing it into two words. A nice instrumental track. Also look out for a remake of the Stooges' "Dirt" which also was included on theResident Evilsoundtrack. I know it's irritating to find an album on the market again so soon after its release, but no one is telling you to buy this either. But go ahead and buy it twice, anyway.

Some albums are perfectly fine, but for some reasons it gets maligned anyway. In some cases I can truly understand, but I don't honestly get what Depeche Mode fans don't like about "Exciter". It may not have the edginess that's being more in Recoil albums now, but it's just as good as most "classic" DM. Gahan's vocals are excellent even more here than "Ultra". "When the Body Speaks" and "The Dead of Night" are some of DM's greatest songs. The former is just plain beautiful and uses the instrumentation we know & love the band for, where "The Dead of Night" possibly the most edgy thing made from DM, with a classic industrial sound, which a couple beginning tracks on the new album sound like. Also take note of the first two tracks, as well as "I Feel Loved" and "Freelove", or even "Goodnight Lovers" which is really gorgeous.Sure, the instrumental tracks aren't much of anything and there's a few DM albums I prefer, but this album doesn't suck by any definition, at least in my eyes. Mark Bell's production may not be as good as Flood's, but get serious people... NO ONE's really is.

If you're new to the White Stripes, don't get this album. Get one of the five LP's, which are all incredible. This is more for people who are already fans of the band. I actually don't care a whole great deal for the cover of Tegan & Sara's hit "Walking with a Ghost," but it's alright. Actually, I liked the live tracks more. Even so, while they are all amazing Stripes songs, it is more like something intended for fans than anything else. I don't really think they're newer releases will be a template from this.On the other hand, a new album, "Icky Thump" is coming out in awhile. We'll see how that one turns out.

The more I listen to this record, the more I think people who do the whole "Nirvana vs. Pearl Jam" thing don't really know how to enjoy a record. They are NOT the same bands at all and it has to do with what style you want. If you want Zeppelin-rock, talent, and (in later records) experimentation, it's better to go for PJ, obviously. If you like punk, Nirvana is the one for you. This is probably Nirvana at their most punk, too. And arguably, had it not been released on a major, people would be calling it "indie" (God I'm glad they don't). Where the last album, "Nevermind" was way more "clean" sounding, "In Utero" shows the noiseman himself, Steve Albini, producing an ugly album for a band who was making surprisingly un-mainstream stuff (but not more heavy like "Bleach).Oh, and look at the price people: $7.99! $7.99! $7.99!Haha, I ended that like a Nirvana song. If you listen to songs on this album, you'll realize that several times that Kurt usually will repeat a line throughout the last minute until the song's fading out ("Rape Me", "Dumb", etc.). It kind of lessens it on repeat listens, but is otherwise just fine.It starts out greatly with "Serve the Servants", which is a track that shows the growth in the album, and just really good songwriting from the band. You'll sing along with the rather simple chorus. I like the way that the band wrote the music on "Serve the Servants"; it's got a great structure. Great riffs and drumming. I like the urgency of the performance of the song. Then you have the classic "Heart-Shaped Box", a great song of the addiction he'd gone through, especially since fame. "Milk It" is very much like the album's suicide note or something. "Pennyroyal Tea" is one of my favorite Nirvana songs ever. The structure seems somewhat drawn out at first, but the lyrics are some of the best Kurt has written, and then as the album goes on, there are still other highlights. "tourette's" is just a simple, fun punk song. It's also very short. People may say it's dumb, but do you really expect the song in which lyrics weren't printed to be the intentionally deep track. "All Apologies" is just so great to listen to. It kind of recalls Joy Division, even. Even though I think JD were way better, this track is where you can hear some of the final thoughts of it. Depending on how you see it, the chorus could be seen as a kind ofThen there's the only song I don't really like on here, "Rape Me". I realize he wanted to make an anti-"SLTS" song, but clearly, people are still listening to the former in spite that. I dunno, it seems lame for intention to me to use the same chords in it. To me, there's a lot more to offer on here than this. It's not terrible, however. However, Kurt got his wish: The album only sold half of what "Nevermind" did and his star was fading more as time went by.I give it four stars just because I feel like people (myself included) give too many albums five stars and I think the "Unplugged" performance blows this out of the water, as hard as it may seem to believe. And also, while "Nevermind" may have been more shiny I have to admit I slightly prefer it just because I think it's more consistent. And even if you don't find yourself liking it, not only is it a bargain; it's interesting. I think it's an album you'll at least like listening to once. All of their albums, however, all have some quality.

And it's from the last album where they would actually release a commercial single stateside. The album starts with the amazing "Ava Adore" which anyone who comes here has also heard. I have heard this single before; I'm probably going to buy it sometime when I get the cash. I have heard both of the B-sides though.Neither are actually spectacular, but they are both pleasant. "Czarina" is a nice fingerpick acoustic track from the Pumpkins and "Once in a While" is nice to hear. It's interesting that there are a couple of B-sides in this era that had James Iha whenever none of the songs that made the album were even co-penned by him.

This album is great. If you get offended easily, you might not like this record. This record is partially a response to the big controversy Em had created at the time, and the theatrics of this record actually are what make it appealing. Some of the interludes reflect upon that. It's definitely a personal album, even if other stuff may become more of a focus. He actually does sound like a maniac on parts of the record, like on the track "Kim" about killing his wife or in some of the still sort of animated lyrics. I actually like the first album more in spite the fact that this album is more mature and reflective. Of course, the hits "Stan" and "The Way I Am", and album cuts like "Marshall Mathers" are other great tracks. "Stan" is memorable because of the obsessive fan and how he gets angrier in each letter, and then the other tracks talk more about the controversy, and one thing I like about this album is it kind of makes you think for yourself. I think that's the point of a track like "Criminal."Then there is actually a couple of weaker tracks. "The Real Slim Shady" is okay, but it seems like songs like this are usually the weakest on his records, in spite being the songs to promote his albums. I don't really like the D-12 song, "Under the Influence," either.Definitely worth a listen.(You may hate him and such, but this album is one of his winners. And metalheads, just stop reviewing stuff because you think you know it based on people who listen to it. People have good reasons why they stereotype you and your music, too, but it doesn't make it anything more than pointless.)

Like Hot Hot Heat or not, you've gotta admit something -- they can make some really great songs. FUN songs. For me, that's part of what keeps me listening. And on top of that, there's an intellegence of the band that keeps them from getting old. While they aren't as energetic and interesting as they were on "Scenes One Through Thirteen", it least it sounds like the band who made "Make Up the Breakdown". This continues the trend of the band's records sounding more mainstream, but don't worry -- this doesn't sound like Nickelback or Simple Plan, but it sounds like Hot Hot Heat. Closest things to compare it to would be Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party.. perhaps also the Killers and Kaiser Chiefs.But as for the songs themselves, they are mostly pretty good. The others are just good. But I remember how when I first heard it how I kept on repeating it. The keyboards can be heard, they are just not obvious like they were on everything HHH did before this. The singles are catchy and intellegent. So are is practically this whole thing. You can hear the keys in "Island of the Honest Man" and "Middle of Nowhere", even on "Running Out of Time", which fits perfectly well with the production. It kind of has a more rock sound in the beginning but if you listen to the verses and chorus the keys -- er, organs, are definitely there. It is still something that stands out about Hot Hot Heat. One thing also nice about that song is that it isn't really the throwback that many people call it. Just because you use the organ and synths doesn't make your work sound like it was from the '60's or '80's.What's also interesting is a more welcomed use of the acoustic guitar, especially heard in the indie-pop "Jingle Jangle" and the super-catchy "Dirty Mouth".That's not to say that the album is great. I'm not downgrading the actual songs, but it's disappointing and a bit depressing how some of these songs sound kind of like rushed, incomplete ideas. "Soldier in a Box" is really great and quirky, and has an even better chorus. The problem? It's too short! This isn't the only place where that happens, either.But if you can appreciate that a band who's deserving of having success can have some, well then you're at no loss and won't have a hard time at all getting into this. I don't think it's as good as the "Knockx3" EP or "MUTB" but the latter is a hard feat to do. Basically as long as the songs are good, aren't dumb, and don't feel too jarring for my liking, I will enjoy it. And if you like songs that are like that too, well then buy.

Yep, you read right. While they may have singles and remix collections, if there is one studio album that I could guarantee that you'll enjoy from Depeche Mode, it's "Violator". Nine tracks and not a single moment that you won't like. I was very, very young when this was out, but my parents were big DM fans. I can see why. I honestly think the only reason someone wouldn't like Depeche is because they don't like synthesizers. Which probably would ruin it for you, but you've also got "Songs of Faith and Devotion" and "Ultra" if that's what you wanted.Every one of these songs is excellent. Not just listenable, not just good. Martin Gore's lyrics shine and so do Gahan's vocals. "World in My Eyes" has a memorable synth solo and is truly addictive. The album's also several of DM's well-known songs that you'll never get tired of. The endlessly-covered-but-never-as-good-as-the-original "Personal Jesus" appears, and it's a great, somewhat edgy and rocking tune, with a blues kind of melody. It shows that DM had a lot of energy and fuel in them at this time. Then it gets into the complete aural bliss of "Halo", one of the best songs and maybe my favorite. There is not a single thing that I dislike about the track. The dark feel of the song and the pulsing sound of the synth on this particular track are just too hard not to get into. "Enjoy the Silence" is one of their most popular tunes as well, and one of my favorite songs ever. I'm sure you've heard it, as it's one that I recall from the majority of my life. It's an example of pop music that works really good. The part towards the end is my absolute favorite part, though. "Policy of Truth" is equally as catchy and memorable. The riff is memorable and then you get into more pure greatness in the sexual come-on "Blue Dress" with its hypnotic structure and "Clean" with its catchy lyrics and nice beats. Towards the end it sounds more industrial and dark, but in the rest of the song, it's Gahan's melodies that stand out. So yeah, start to beginning is really where "Violator"'s greatness is.The mellow moments are nice, too. "The Sweetest Perfection" isn't any less appealing of a DM track, although one of the more sinister melodies on the album. I especially like "Waiting for the Night", which actually reminds me of some of Bj&ouml;rk's mellower moments. In spite of this, it is definitely DM and this was when she was a Sugarcube still. The song's peaceful feeling is matched by the lyrics.The segues at the end of "Enjoy the Silence" and "Blue Dress" are really interesting. They are also really entertaining, so even if it doesn't flow into an actual song, it's nice to hear. They can also work as good intermissions; sometimes I'll leave to do something else while those are on.There are very few times when an artist's sales reflect their quality, but "Violator" is one of those albums. It's catchy, yet it's also got some actual musical depth and lyrics you'll enjoy. The segues are really interesting and I think that with its great price, there's so little you won't enjoy. They are a bit prolific for someone like me to really know what to buy next, but it's inevitable that you'll enjoy "Violator". Its five-star amazon.com average is not unwarranted. If you want to hear what alternative rock was based in before Nirvana, this is a good call. Or if you like electronic music, DM were real groundbreakers for that. And it sure helps to know that there's an album for you where you don't want to skip a single track.

Yes, you read right, I think it's overrated. But in my review I want to mention exactly what I think is so overrated about it.The first thing to mention is that yes I know it's the only album that the band has ever released. This was an influence on several punks such as Nirvana (plus tons of underground bands who "never sold out") and was probably the most punk of the bands in the era. However, does that mean that they were the best? No way. I see the Clash's first album as a much better example of what the band was attempting, which is similar to this. I hate to sound intellectual but to me a five-star album is one that not only is just important but keeps you listening all the time. Some of the songs on "Never Mind the Bollocks" are quite memorable and all, but the songs are just not the classics they are written to be as. It's true that Johnny's voice is really whiny and they weren't talented, but since they all sounded like they were in the same record this album became listenable. Songs like "Pretty Vacant" are a lot of fun to listen to and I like the controversial issues like on "Bodies", but I also don't really care about how angry it's supposed to be. I just care about what the songs are. An especially overrated song is "Anarchy in the U.K.", which while clearly in politics with punk doesn't have much more in it than its cool intro.I guess it's also that the band was in fact an image more than anything, earlier in the mentioning of how Glen Matlock, the talented member, didn't fit that particular image and later got kicked out of the band. His are most of those that I mentioned that were good. I'll admit that this is wonderful compared to most screamo and pop-punk, yet what does that really say?I guess it's three stars because the album is put out as being better than it is. If you're a punk then go for it I guess, otherwise just go by whatever. I don't even mind that it isn't very hard to make the songs; that is what punk was invented for. But there's quite a bit of songs that I don't consider worth the listen and therefore would recommend many other things in the era.

Ever since I heard them a few years ago, I've been hooked on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. I first heard the diverse and funFever To Tell, and while that didn't have a lot of depth, it didn't really need it. It's one of those that sold because of how much it rocked. I recently got around to thedebut EP, which was also quite good as well. On this album, lots is added that wasn't quite as present as on the other albums.Karen O kind of reminds me of Tegan and/or Sara on some of the tracks. She does a lot more singing on here and less yelping than in previous times, but it's not a boring record. I think "Honeybear" sounds like the "old" YYY's. I've always enjoyed Nick Zinner's guitar riffs and some of the stuff here is actually quite interesting. For one thing, half of the lyrics are cryptic, like stream of consciousness tracks. Then you get the ones about unrequited love like "Cheated Hearts," one of the album's finest tracks, if not the finest.Songs like "The Sweets" show an added musical depth. The track is simple, yet I like how it all flows together on the track. It sort of sounds like a demo, actually, but one mastered to CD quality. This one also emphasizes the group's new wave influences more than the previous works. There's really no filler on here.I remembered being really crushed last fall when I missed out on seeing them. Oh well, there's the records to make up for the lacked experience. This record makes me still interested in whatever comes next from the group. Judging by this record, they'll be around for awhile.

Yeah, I know I reviewed this earlier, but I feel in retrospect that it wasn't the least bit justified. Now I have a fuller familiarization of the record and have to put the two cents in perspective. Maybe it could be my anticipation to hearThe Alchemy Index, Vols. 1-2soon and my largely increased fandom, but for what it's worth, this album can't be given less than five stars for me. Not now.The first album showed a young band with promise who actually hits the promise. This album easily eclipses that one though. It is easily the most heavy of the four Thrice albums released, and that's not to say that there aren't melodic points or anything in there. "Trust" slows things down and is a wonderful track, even a beautiful one. The band members' talents shine through, and on that track I'd say that particularly Riley's drumming does.There are interesting elements that abound in the record. "Deadbolt" is a dynamic track that succeeds in each way. It begins with melodic singing in the verses and has a very heavy climax. Then Teppei Taranishi plays some awesome noodling in the mix before the track gives out to a classical piece at the end. "In Years to Come" is just plain incredible, with some fine lyrics especially for guys barely into their twenties ("I want to write the perfect song and play it just for you/I need you more than I'll ever know/Until my dying day, my lungs will take you for granted"). "Betrayal Is a Symptom" and "The Red Death" are both impressive in talent and in their heaviness. "See You in the Shallows" is not generally the most talked about track but is an instant favorite of mine. It shows that they were able to easily succeed at being heavy and melodic simultaneously and very memorable of a track. Also notable is the awesome intro of "A Living Dance Upon Dead Minds."If you're into melodic hardcore I am guessing you own this. If you don't there's little reason to still be waiting as it is incredibly written. I feel like the band eclipsed this recording withVheissubut recommend this at all costs.

Although I enjoy MCR's music, I admittedly get why some do not: The image and some song titles seem destined for a hot-topic crowd, and I was kind of burned out on these types of bands when the record was out. However, make no mistake: "Three Cheers" is one of the top albums of its genre.Hooks are abundant on the release, and it's also got some creativity and verve in the tracks that keeps the listener wnating more. My favorites on here are "Prison," "Ghost of You," and "Jetset Life." All of these songs are excellent and succeed at some of the fronts mentioned. "Prison" is a pretty unique track and kind of was a taste of what came later from the band. "Ghost" is them making a ballad and succeeding at it. It's such a beautiful track and the chord progression is awesome. It's basically flawless. "Jetset" is a pretty anthemic, heavier track on the album.Then you get a lot of themes about gender-bending ("Give 'Em Hell"), and stuff like death on the record. But what could you expect out of guys inspired by the likes of Bowie and Queen, and generally labeled "emo-goth"? This would be a natural result. And more often than not, the tracks succeed on the album, and is actually worth repeat listens.There are a couple of lowlights, however. In spite being their breakthrough hit, I actually find "I'm Not Okay" to be a bit annoying, and I'm also not a real big "Hang 'Em High" fan.Still, if you are willing to give this record a chance I think you'll find something to enjoy. Of course, a typical metalhead is going to dismiss anything under the band's name by principle, but this band is actually one of the better of its type.

Type O Negative were an interesting band, and here they make a turning point album. Less of the thrash roots of Carnivore and more of a gothic sound are put in. Many of the songs are very long, and while some have talked about it being cheesy and campy, I actually find that's part of the record's charm. The sense of humor in some places is not politically correct in the least ("Kill All the White People," "We Hate Everyone") and even in other things, like trying to keep negative. The back of the CD has something inside that says "Don't mistake lack of talent for genious" and the like, and for some reason that stuff kinda cracks me up. But make no mistake: They play really well.The greatest songs on here, by and large, are the first two full songs: "Christian Woman" and "Black No. 1," both TON classics. "CW" is kind of like four tracks in one, and the keyboards and melody are both really memorable. My personal favorite is "Black," with its crunchy riffs and harpsi-chord-sounding part before the coda. The title track is also great. Although not really an album I am always revisiting in full, I usually do get something out of listening to this. Unfortunately though, I find it more rewarding to listen in snippets than in full.I think if you like goth and metal that this record will work well for you. Excellent release.

With the release of The Bends, you'd know that Radiohead were going to release a good album, but didn't know it would sound like this probably. This album isn't as catchy or accessible, but those who appreciate full concept albums will love this one. It's only a little better than The Bends, but because The Bends is so hard to excel. That's where you can tell that Radiohead are not a usual band.I can understand where you wouldn't like it though. If you are a top-forty listener who likes what's catchy, I hope you hate it or stay away from it (unless it does change what you think). OK Computer is the type of album that is for those who will allow albums to grow on people.Opener "Airbag" is over four and a half minutes, and has some of the coolest things done with it. The guitars are beautiful, the drums are interesting toward the end, and so on. The only downpoint is that the mixture of mumbly and whiny vocals makes it harder to understand, but I look in the booklet anyways."Paranoid Android" is now my personal all-time favorite song. You get over six minutes of a song that won't bore you because it won't keep the same sound as before. For instance, I love the second half a lot. Especially the way the song goes from its heavy part to a relaxed acoustic part, which is excellent for awhile, and I also like when the acoustic guitars go fast before getting heavy again at the end and the guitars being weirder at that part."Subterranean Homesick Alien" is ALSO beautiful. I love the guitars on this one as well. I like the line "I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me/they'd think that I finally lost it completely..." about being an alien. It's laid back and it's still solid.Oh yeah, you get to another song which will change within time. "Exit Music (For A Film)" has acoustic guitar, with Thom quietly singing, in it, then there's the part when Phil starts with the drums and the song starts changing on the guitars, when they get a lot more interesting. I love the atmosphere on this one. Maybe because the idea was from a Beatles song."Let Down" is excellent as well. It has influenced songs I like such as Remy Zero's "Prophecy", and has a good melody, and it being laid back rather than too whiny or anything of the like is what also makes me like it. The guitars once again are epic."Karma Police" was overrated, but it's equally good as the other five maybe. The pianos are taken from a White Album song by the Beatles. I like the ending guitars though, because they are interesting. Then you get "Fitter Happier" after that, a voice of AppleTalk for nearly two minutes. Then...You get "Electioneering" a classic Radiohead tune. The guitars are flawless on here. This is one of the more catchy tunes here, though a little weird. The falsetto is excellent."Climbing Up The Walls" is the darkest-sounding of the songs on here. It's very interesting. I love the part after the trumpet arrangement or whatever that follows to a real cool guitar line. Then later you get to a scream which seems to be the climax, because in the next 40 seconds the song sort of rests."No Surprises" is beautiful as well. It's the most mellow of the songs on OK Computer, and is a good chillout tune, though maybe not the best here."Lucky" is my second favorite on this album. It's melodic, has some sort of weird guitars, and is very memorable. I think this was on a UK compilation before being on OKC, but it deserved to be here.Just after a plane crashed on the last song, you get one saying "slow down", which is ironically the final song here, "The Tourist". This song has a very interesting ending which seems to have a ding noise, and is very falsetto-laden kind of like OK Computer.This album is equally good to The Bends probably, and a little better than 2000's Kid A which is better than Amnesiac. If you like music which is creative and reminds you of U2, the Alan Parsons Project, Pink Floyd, and The Beatles, you should check out OK Computer, which is reasonably listed as an ...essential.

Smashing Pumpkins came into the scene withGishafter two other indie-label singles, which was excellent in spite the unfortunate fact that the songs are more same-y than in later records. This single was intended to be the "Rhinoceros" single but the band did not know it was going to be released as an EP."Rhinoceros" is played similar to the album except this one's like 30 seconds shorter, taking out the atmospheric outro. Wonderful song if there is one. Let's move on."Blue" is pretty subpar, a track better off left from Gish. It sounds just like most of the heavy stuff but unlike those songs hooks don't sink and shine through in repeated listens. "Slunk," on the other hand is nice rockin' from the Pumpkins. If you like heavy and grungy Pumpkins, this one is a real treat. In fact, it is possibly the reason to own this EP if you're interested.Well, "Bye June" is kind of interesting too, one of the band's earliest recordings. It was only a demo and kind of has an incomplete feel.So half of this stuff was not on album orPisces Iscariotwhich makes it okay to look through.

And a lot of the time I like weird. Just not all the time. This is one of those cases. I feel like while this album has its moments that it just isn't nearly as great as their other albums. I totally respect what they do here, but I couldn't get into the super long songs. Usually the songs that I listen to that are have more edge to them or something wild, but those I both found to be rather boring. Perhaps I need to do more work but I really am not interested enough to keep doing that. Especially when there is a lot better stuff out there. Just listen to "Handshake Drugs", "I'm A Wheel" and "Theologians". Those are the good ones.By the way, these guys were extremely overrated to begin with. I try to let this album sink in, but I guess since it blends with the "jam" sound and that never connected with me, this album isn't really anything for me. I never said it was bad because I don't want to give you the impression that it's bad. But it seems like people think they are completely infallable. They have talent but Jeff Tweedy's vocals sound like your typical whiny lead indie singer (not a bad thing, but noticable).

Well, I had to see that the third time was a charm, after hearing "Merrymakers" and later "King James Version". The latter is what made me decide that I'd buy whatever came next from Harvey Danger. They continue the pattern of making a follow-up release that is totally different from the predecessor. To me, a truly great band has evolution in their career, and this band shows that. What I wasn't expecting, however, was a piano-based album, in spite of songs like "Loyalty Bldg." and "Pike St./Park Slope" on the predecessor albums.There are a couple of hints of familiarity on this album, so don't let that scare you or anything. "Wine, Women, and Song" has a familiar piano and vocal melody which makes the song stand out, then right into the single "Cream and Bastards Rise" which sort of resembles some of "KJV". The use of the guitar is also more familiar. There's also "Cool James" which finally makes its appearance on an HD record, one of the more familiar structures from the band.But some of the differences lie in songs like "Moral Centralia" and "Little Round Mirrors", the former having these Christmas-like chimes and the latter with French horns and trombones. There's even a melody of the vocals that goes along with it. I know I never heard those on the first two albums!The whole album is pretty good itself. It is its own record. It is still warming up to me a little bit, so I can't fully decide yet if it is as good as "KJV", but there are very few albums I like more than it, and I think two are by the same artist. This thing is a real treat for the fans. We may not have Evan Sult here but while I can understand people considering that a loss, I also feel that they have a better drummer here.Bonus Disc is a good addition when considering that the album is still only $11.99. It's got a few tracks of the sessions that made it and some completely new songs. Those are pretty good. Even though that hidden song on that disc is pretty short.And if in doubt, just go to their official web site. If not, you're not going to be that disappointed, because 2 CD's for that price? That's a bargain.

Garbage was one of the greatest alternative bands of the 90's, and is one of my top ten favorite bands of all-time. The blend of electronic, pop, and rock has always really connected with me. While the first two albums had more standout singles and I still prefer "Version 2.0" to this (there's not much I don't), it is an excellent release.I've recently found myself listening to this one more lately. I don't know how people could possibly dismiss an album with the song "Cup of Coffee" on it. It's beautiful, heartbreaking, etc, and arguably the greatest song they have ever made. I also like the use of more orchestrated pop songs on the album, just like in that song. It has an interesting variety and never lacks in melody. It takes time to fully appreciate and I think it's totally worth it. My next favorite after that song is "Nobody Loves You", which nicely mixes acoustic guitar with trippy electronics. I like the synths and hip-hop beat of "Androgyny", and that theme goes on through a song like "Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)", an unbashedly 80's tune. To me, this album is as truly Garbage as the first two albums. The album has a lot of really great lyrics, one of the things that makes the album so strong.Also, if you're longing for the harder alternative tunes, this album does deliver some of those, like in the spoken-word "Shut Your Mouth" and the bass-heavy "Silence is Golden." I can't believe how good this sounds. To me, giving a raw, unproduced sound wouldn't have worked as well for a band like Garbage.It unfortunately is the one that gets most flack, but boy are people missing out. It might not be for everybody, however I think you should be more open-minded when checking out a release like this. Just because they aren't trying to re-live their glory days doesn't make it ungood.

Yeah, along with Mariah Carey and 50 Cent, we have the Most Overrated Album of 2005. It makes all the top albums of the year list, yet it's because of what? I'll start trying to tell you what this is. Even the people praising him admit that there's little substance to his songs. These may be catchy, but after awhile when people listen to this they'll wonder what was really so great about it. Maybe not as idiotic and sucky as Boyz N Da Hood, but this is still no good. It's an album full of bulls*** and I am disappointed that even people in my musical cohort tend to praise stuff like this. If I like it then it might be because of a guest or something, though I think that's what makes it a star lower than it'd regularly be..Besides, his Snowman image thing grates my nerves even more, but listening to it does nothing to redeem that. Oh yeah, but it not only gives him more street cred but sends a message to the kids. What has the world come to these days. At least 2005 had decent (or dare I say GREAT) albums like "The Documentary", "Almost Platinum" or even the ones from Kanye and Common (unsurprisingly). This is on par with that current BEP album.

Yep, you read right. If you're expecting/hoping for Skinny Puppy to repeat the days of "Too Dark Park" and "Remission," avoid this album at all costs. People who like hearing something new or fresh: Totally buy this. It's a wonderful album from front to back. Even though they made an entire political album, it was nice to hear, and after hearing the song they did from Underworld, I could hear a band ready to return with some creativity.If you want it to be as bizarre as the past, you're at a loss, too. But if you compare it to the stuff on the radio, you are simply over-reacting. Not even this is close to what the mainstream would/will embrace, but it's catchy and all of the songs were well-written. Some of the songs kind of remind me of the modern EBM. It is not a vain attempt to remain relevant, as it is completely natural with Skinny Puppy. "I'mmortal" is an amazing opener, and many of the others are also pretty good. They show that they don't have to be completely devoid of song structures to be interesting, and for those who laugh at this band, they might find themselves slowly suckering into the group after this.I mean, if you're not just one of those "old day" fans, there is so much that this album has in it. I can't judge if it's the best album they've made, but it is as good as you can hope for.

In my pop music, I like some attitude and style, and those are two things you can get in hearing Lily's music. Oh, and compared to many with the label, the music you hear on "Alright, Still" is actually pretty creative and somewhat artistic. That just makes the songs even stronger. This is one of those albums that is fun to go back to because of the bombastic fun of listening to the record.Is it a guilty pleasure for me? Not really. The songs themselves are full of style, with a couple of admittedly throwback-sounding tracks, but added with a few songs with a ska/reggae twist ("Friday Night") and such. It is funny but without being overly idiotic which helps in its favor. I generally smirk when I hear "Knock 'Em Out" and sometimes can relate with the issues tackled on "Everything's Just Fine." If you like the big pop sound of "Smile" which is nice enough you'll probably also like "LDN" which is a more upbeat sounding track. Most of it is, really. It does a lot without seeming much like a novelty record which makes it wholly impressive. Even with a track that kind of is on the record, I tend to enjoy the parody track "Nan You're a Window Shopper," which has many clever points ("We've done our Christmas shopping and we're only in April") and makes for an entertaining listen. I like music that entertains and so this stuff is totally satisfying from a fan who wishes music wouldn't always take itself so seriously.If you'd like more life in your music and something that makes for a memorable listen I recommend you some listens of this album. It is everything I was hoping for and more. I can't wait to hear what she'll do in the future, and hopefully next time we'll get an album issued in America at the same time it's released in Europe. One of 2007's strongest releases.

It might disappoint "halo collectors" when they get a hold of this, seeing as some remixes previously appeared on other singles. However, this is much cheaper and considering I wasn't big on "With Teeth", I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this.The title track is one of the great tracks on "With Teeth". While not the straightforward, anthemic "The Hand That Feeds" or the electro-funk "Only", it stands out in its own way. It's sort of a slow-burner, but with a nice melody. The DFA remix of "The Hand That Feeds" is worth the price of this thing. It is quite the contrast of the original, this one being much more of an electro track. If you like DFA stuff like LCD Soundsystem, I think you'll enjoy the remix. Sure, it's kind of lengthy, but that ain't such a bad thing. The other remix is sort of just an extended mix of the original, although focusing more on instrumental parts of the song.The El-P remix of "Only" is also another great one here. It gives the song an awesome trip-hop feel, which I think fits better for the spoken word first verse than the actual song itself. It's a lot of fun to listen to. The other remix of the song is okay. And then there's the awesome "Sam Fog vs. Carlos D." remix of "Every Day...", which is quite an enjoyable track. The remix is kind of interesting, although I have never thought of the song as anything I'd dance to or would.It isn't the greatest NIN single/album, but the best we could expect. It makes me optimistic about the future of NIN since I wasn't actually as consistently impressed with a lot of the recent stuff, in spite my love for the first four albums (esp. "The Fragile") and the live performance I saw last year. I recommend it if you are a NIN fan. Not quite as good as the "Downward Spiral" singles, but it's just about as good.

I actually understand where many who don't like this come from. This isn't really the most energetic album I've come across at all, but it's not about being heavy or intense -- it is neither of those things. Also, I agree that the excessive hype made me hesistant and I still think Wilco are a very overrated band, however, this is one time when they actually do impress me. If you followed them before, this might not seem as "groundbreaking" as other critics kept calling it. There are a bunch of great songs, and one thing I also disagree about it people talking about how the record's esoteric. It's not. These are mostly pop songs, although in cases like "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart," the electronics of the track come in, kind of like a new element to their song. Also, the group transcended from alt-country long earlier in their career, arguably as far back as "Being There" from '96. Jeff Tweedy is not an amazing vocalist, but is listenable and fits with the music fine enough. I may also note that his voice doesn't exactly sound uplifting, either. The emotion/character and the songs are what make "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" a great record. It did not seem unnecessary to me like the re-hash of older works put through new age music (in my terms) known as "A Ghost Is Born," and the songs do more for me than on "Summerteeth," actually.If I could make any complaint, it's that "Reservations" could have ended about three minutes sooner. That was a completely unnecessary and draggy ending. That being said, it is a minor complaint, and if you're into hooks, give it some time for them to sink in because they are there. This record is a winner and while I'm not huge on Wilco, I am a fan of "YHF".

I have to say that while I found the band's last album, "Good News.." to be a slight disappointment, I didn't think it sounded like a sellout at all. It was much more quirky than the typical records out there, and even some of the more trendy music out at the time. And while the band's most accessible album to date, "Ship" is 100% a Modest Mouse record. Even with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr now in the fold, even when Shin James Mercer does background vocals. And while it's also clean produced like the last one, that doesn't mean it's over-polished at all.Of course, there's people who will try and insult people who like this new stuff, and there'll be a few mainstream sheep who decide it's good because the masses told them. But let's get realistic: Modest Mouse have been on a major label since 2000's "The Moon & Antarctica." (The album that introduced me to the band.) Them taking steps to commercial steps was inevitable from there. I have no problem with them becoming big. If you like them to stick with the Sonic Youth-type of seven-minute jam-out songs, just stick with "Long Drive" and "The Lonesome Crowded West." This, the new record, does actually have an epic track in it, "Spitting Venom," which starts out raw and acoustic in its first minute and a half but soon builds up from that. It's kind of interesting, as is the rest of the album.Besides, I can't remember the pump organ and accordion being used so often in pop music as it is on here. There's no real Isaac Brock freak-outs here, but he still is full of personality on here. Also, where the interludes seemed a bit annoying and unnecessary last time, the newly used instruments are now utilized into actual songs! It's a more mature Modest Mouse album, and while consistent, it's never boring. You get the more easily digestible stuff like the acoustic-based "Little Motel" and the ultra-catchy "Steaming Engenius" (next single perhaps?). They change the tempos and structures at times this time around, too, on the excellent "Parting of the Sensory." Really, none of the 14 songs are bad at all.If you can respect and accept that your little band is now shooting for the stars, I think you'll find something to enjoy on the band's fifth LP. It is not perhaps the most startling of the band's albums, but they don't need to do that with us anymore. I couldn't have possibly asked for a better album from these guys.

Muse are one of the most exciting bands of today. They are definitely an acquired taste, and if you don't like the epic stadium-rock of bands like Queen, you might not really like this record. Also, the keyboards sound very '70's prog-rock-ish. Some of that took a little time for the record to grow on me, but it didn't take long and was more than worth the time.The record has three Muse classics: "Starlight," "Map of the Problematique," and "Invincible." "Starlight," the big hit from the record, is melodic and has a beautiful melody, one of the group's strongest songs. "Map of the Problematique" almost sounds heavenly, with its futuristic sound and its keybaords. The guitar riffs on this one are interesting, too. "Invincible" is more top-notch tunefulness from Muse. This one is more straightforward than the other two but hardly less good.Then the album has its highlights all over. There's the quirky neo-industrial-meets-interesting falsetto vocals of "Supermassive Black Hole," the brief and eerie "Soldier's Poem" has some great lyrics, and great riffs and songs appear throughout. This record is possibly my favorite Muse album yet. All four of 'em are great. And if you haven't gotten this yet, well it's never too late. One of my top five albums of last year.

I've been a big NIN fan for years. I don't think I'll ever forgetThe Fragile, because after hearing that album, my life has not been the same. I went back and the other three albums were pretty good (yes, I'm callingBrokenan album). I have to admit that I was very disappointed two years ago withWith Teeth. It had a few moments, but I didn't like hearing a guy into his 40's writing more middle school poetry. And also, some songs would've been finely arranged without the inclusion of some kind of annoying things."Year Zero" sounds nothing like the other NIN albums, really. It's hard for me to compare the record to what came before it. Although unlike "Teeth," it all is kind of a coherent theme throughout. The music fits well with the concept as well, as some of this does actually sound apocalyptic. My favorite song of these is probably "Vessels," an industrial classic on this record. Instrumentals come back here too, as in the short opening track and also "Another Version of the Truth." There are lots of sounds and elements here that amaze me. The lyrics here are not seventh grade poetry, instead, it's more like a commentary of the direction of the world. Another great sonic track is "My Violent Heart," which follows through the eerie intro of "The Warning." There's still a kind of funky feel in some of the songs, like "Capital G," and there's a nice trip-hop sound in "Me, I'm Not." The record is excellent, and because it sounds nothing like previous endeavors, I'm hesitant to call it a "return to form." Still, what you get here is above average, definitely.If you like NIN, you should give it a chance, and probably will if you're loyal enough. While I don't enjoy it as much as the first three yet and probably never will to the level of "The Fragile," it is a worthwhile addition to your collection.

I think the funniest thing is that when you look at the negative reviews for this album, none of them are on target unless they talk about their already-big hatred for Corgan/The Pumpkins. Also, I saw a review that said this was just "power chords". That has to be the most off-target assessment for the album, EVER. Because being a guitar player myself, sometimes it's hard for me to catch on to Billy Corgan's guitar playing. There is quite a bit of depth here musically and lyrically. Many "emo" bands wish that they could make a record like this: Full of emotion and musical proficiency. I honestly don't think I could find a thing on this album that isn't enjoyable.The perfect way to start an album? "Cherub Rock". Intro is drumroll and then some octave-like guitar playing (this was hard for me because I didn't know what I was being told to do when I read a tablature for the album) and it totally does rock. Even before that distortion turns it into a wall of sound it is an anthem. One that is a great middle finger to the indie scene of the time."Quiet" starts out with some cool guitar sliding and then gets more rockin', a great song with a nice timing and is one of the most simple on the album. However, it's fun to listen to and you can hear the angst in Corgan's vocals.Then it gets to one of the best songs made ever: "Today". Even after all that time it gets played on the radio it is an amazing song. The intro is one of my favorite intro riffs ever, and while simple is fun to play on guitar. Other than that it is somewhat ironic that he wrote this as his alternative solution to suicide. It's quite the melodic song and became a hit for a good reason. On top of the fact that the music video was so good (I'll get to that on another review). Then it follows into "Hummer" with one of the coolest intros I've heard in a song; its static intro is what makes the song, as well as the melody it gets into. One of the more challenging songs on the record.Then comes in to "Rocket" which pretty much stands out because of the guitar solo and the cool Boss Octave effect. Its chorus is short yet notable. Then comes into "Disarm", a peacefully song with cello and chimes which shows a great sentimental side of the Pumpkins. It is another one that became a classic. When you think about it, Billy's melody is similar to that on Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here".Next we get to a relatively soft song that picks up, and was partially penned by James Iha. Wall of sound this is as there was like fourteen guitar tracks in this and it also has Mike Mills of R.E.M. fame on piano in the beginning. Such a heartbreaking song to listen to but also very good. One of the longer songs on "Dream", yet also one that will connect with a lot of listners. Basically, "Geek U.S.A." is the song that represents the album the best. It's kind of like a three-part track; one part just rocks, then the bridge changes up the pace a little bit but is interesting, and then the melody starts to sound familiar with the rest of the album. Then it gets into one of the greatest guitar solos of the '90s, with a great delivery on everything from Corgan and Chamberlin (the drummer, for those who didn't know). Then you get into another one that has music partially written by James Iha, this time in "Mayonaise", which has some of Billy's greatest lyrics possibly ever. Everything about it is a good-structured song and is repeat worth listenings. Then it goes on to a more quiet side with "Spaceboy" which also has that orchestral instrumentation.The album isn't through with ideas just there. "Silverf**k" has an almost funk-like delivery in the verses but is really a rawking song in its chorus. It's really interesting; perhaps more than the rest of the record. Almost nine minutes but it won't be too hard for you to get into, either. Then it kind of gets happier in its last two songs: "Sweet, Sweet" and "Luna". The former is very simple and short, while the latter is similar in instruementation to "Disarm" (but more happy as stated before), another song full of emotion and everything in a track that is supposed to be good. I don't think I'd need to tell you that it's great for you to know it; even just listening to the samples will make you think of why this record connects with as many people as it does. I don't find it the least bit overrated.After listening to the record you will find out that complaining about Corgan's ego is just stupid because his music more than makes up for that (although I am admittedly a biased fan and didn't think his quotes I've read were overtly so). Besides, what matters more is what you get. It's one of those cases where the album sales actually reflect the quality of the album. Nixing out the grunge influence of "Gish" and further expanding on wall-of-sound guitar delivery and a good mix between the heavy and soft is what you will get on "Siamese Dream". Your record collection is not complete without it. Also, listen to "Gish" and "Siamese Dream" because I guarantee you that you won't mind Corgan's vocals. They sound real on-key and melodic here. Not as much of a band effort as other efforts but still worth listening to.

Okay, so I became acquainted with PTree through a friend of mine who made a mix CD that had everything they had done back fromStupid Dream(and a couple of months before it got re-issued, too) and I enjoyed the compilation immensely. It had five songs fromIn Absentiawhich was where I started. I soon after got this and aforementioned "Stupid Dream" and at first "In Absentia" had those two overshadowed for me. This was a few months before the new album, by the way, that I heard all of this.But many, many months along the line and I have to say that "Deadwing" is far away my favorite Porcupine Tree release, worthy of five full stars. It's one of my top twenty albums of all time by this point, and for a good reason. The songs on here do go back to some of the self-indulgence in progressive rock, but that's not a bad thing. This has a big variety and contary to the title it runs quite well into flight as it gets to its climaxes."Shallow," the American single, is by far the most straightforward thing on the entire album. It's suprrisingly commercial but it's not a bad thing, as it has many of the band's strengths, including anthemic riffs and an awesome chorus. The verses kind of remind me of Radiohead, actually.Things start out with the acoustic-and-electric title track which sets the tone of things pretty well. It is dark and interesting like most things Steven Wilson. Nine and a half minutes and it entertains you that entire time. "Lazarus" is surprisingly calm for following those two tracks, but it is a pretty beautiful song with a memorable chorus. I speak of these things pretty quickly I recognize but I don't think I can even get you the whole meat of these songs in an actual review.There's other riff-heavy moments like in the wonderful "Open Car" and what's more enthralling yet in the second half is "The Start of Something Beautiful," with its bass-y synths in the beginning and then it goes to amazing melodies as well and with Wilson's general lyrics of a family dysfunction and such. I remember one night when I took a very, very long walk in the city in somewhat cold weather and I had this playing with me and it worked pretty effectively.Of course as a centerpiece is "Arriving Somewhere But Not Here," with some awesome harmonizing a la the last album's "Heart Attack in a Layby" and is almost as strong. It doesn't really bore me or seem too excessive in its nature which is both a surprising and enthralling thing in the song.They do recycle something from an older album, but since they make it that damn hard to getLightbulb SunI really don't mind that "She'smovedon" is added at the end, one of the earlier singles from a PT album. It adds nicely to the end of the album.What you get here are ten very solid tracks worthy of repeat listens, and if it's been collecting dust I suggest you pop it in your player again because when I started doing that more the album did wonders for me. I always knew it was great but only recently have I recognized in full the total brilliance and how wonderful the thing really is. How could you not praise such a recording is something that goes beyond my comprehension. It's one thing that has to be heard to be believed. I feel a bit bad that my review can't even do the record justice, but I just hope maybe you'll come across this with a similar feeling. "In Absentia" is still amazing but that's my second favorite PT album now.

You know, Beck is respectable but it doesn't mean that I enjoy all of his albums. I mean, nothing by him touches Odelay but there's still other works I enjoy (Mellow Gold, Midnite Vultures, Sea Change, Guero). However, this release is just strange and I wonder how even the biggest fans of the record can listen to each song the whole way STRAIGHT from beginning to end. Sometimes, I view this as a mixtape and One Foot as a demo collection.The biggest put-off for me is probably the song titles. There are three untitled songs that thereby screw up the rest of the track listing. "No Money No Honey" is listed as track 7 but is really 8, etc (there's two more untitled mystery tracks later, too!). And that one seems like a joke I'd like to use for a song, but it's just a guy saying that for TWO MINUTES! I kid you not.What I do like is the first two songs, "Pink Noise (Rock Me Amadeus)" and "Rowboat." The former has this cool garage-ish riff and some of his most intense music while the latter is a more steel pedal-infused old-fashioned type country song. It's also somewhat interesting on the fourth track where they have that sample about the aliens, which almost feels like something tied in with the first three date-based titles.Every time I've tried to listen to it the full way through I've had to hit the skip button before a song ends. I don't know if I think it's creatively brilliant or just outright garbage sometimes. Both sides tell me it's not perfect and both sides agree that the record has some moments. So that's a constant. There's also this pointless noise part that is hidden at the very ending of the album. There's so much you have to get past that I don't know if it's worth it for a casual. It's lo-fi trash vibe has charm but goes over and crosses the line to annoyance at times.If you get it, just beware.

And it may not even be rocket science, but "The Bends" proves that the band can make good songs even without the sonic wows that made later works inOK ComputerandKid A. For me, these albums kind of make a Radiohead trilogy. Later albums in their catalog would even borrow from these two. Hints of what is to come later are here actually, even in the first few notes of "Planet Telex," with its sort of spacey vibe. Radiohead isn't for the listener who wants fist-pumping music or something you blast out in the car. Instead, they are more like the band you'd listen to in isolation. And while some people question the band's sincerity, to me this is irrelevnat -- these songs would be great either way.They didn't like being plagued as "the 'Creep' band" and on here this shows that there's much more to Radiohead than one hit. And "High and Dry" is just as catchy if you want something instant or moving. There is no real filler here, and while "OK" might be better, I actually like this one a little more. The tracks are a bit more standout-ish for me. They do the acoustics quite well, like in the chill-out folk-ish "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" or the brilliant classic "Fake Plastic Trees," or even the underrated and gorgeous "Bullet Proof (I Wish I Was)." I love listening to this album (and band) when I'm in after a hectic day and hear their calm and relaxing music. And there is distortion on the album as well. "Just" and "My Iron Lung" use some and are both highlights of the album. The former is probably my favorite on this album and the latter is a catchy number with memorable riffs, and a line saying that the song's a total waste of time. There is some sarcastic humor in the tracks, although alienation is a big theme of the group. I really like the chords on tracks like "(nice dream)" though. No lowlights, really.This wouldn't be a bad start for your ownership on albums from the band. And compared to what came later, this might actually be the most streamlined of their efforts. Yes, it's pop music, but it's great pop music at that. And people overlook its influence, as it's been often imitated, but never duplicated. This and Jeff Buckley'sGraceare the quintessential mid-90's with impact on the Britpop scene of then.

I know it's an uncommon opinion, but I actually find that "Warning:" is Green Day's finest hour. Although it doesn't have a certain slacker charm that made "Dookie" identify with the masses, that's okay because the group got older. Where "nimrod." was the group experimenting outside of punk, it was somewhat unfocused and not one of their better records. However, they totally took a swing with the right direction on "Warning:"This record is NOT a sell-out. But then again, they are like Metallica and U2, where their success gives them many critics. But the guy from Green Day could never have cared less. This album has some of their greatest song-writing, even though not quite everyone would identify with it. Here you hear instruments in the mix like mandolin, accordion, and harmonica. They totally experiment on the track "Misery," although that one is great. "Waiting" and "Macy's Day Parade" are Green Day classics. The former has power-pop hooks that got people sold on the band in the first place and the latter is a great acoustic-style track. I think if you have an open mind for this style, you'll enjoy it. It seems like people who liked "American Idiot" would enjoy this record as well. It is a less epic and theatric album, and more easily digestible, at least for me.Definitely recommended.

I have to admit, if the Used had first come out just a couple of years ago, I'd probably hate them. They came out well before my anti-emo phase, though. And I always kind of had a soft spot for them. And I could actually understand why someone would hate them. I found them annoying the first few times around. Then the single "Buried Myself Alive" came out and I was surprised that I enjoyed that one as much as I did. I later found the album cheap used (and discounted!) so I decided to pick it up. The record is quite good, although it's nothing ground-breaking. However, this group makes pop songs, and are much easier to get into than the likes of Thursday, since the music is less self-indulgent and the lyrics aren't as artistic and ambiguous.The hidden track, "Choke Me" is fun though, kind of a different and more hardcore-type track from the group, and has one of my favorite bass riffs from Jeph. The record isn't perfect, and I'd probably give it a 3.5 to be exact, but there's enough saving grace here for me to round it up. The songs don't hide their melodramatics and this can either make or break things for the listener.Honestly, it's an album that's easier for me to listen to every once in awhile than many times in a row. That being said, it works for some and could include you. There is a nice energy in this album that makes it worth owning.

This, the debut album from Kaiser Chiefs, shows great talent and promise. I can't believe a band on their first album can write such great songs to be honest. The weak songs are actually decent, and the best songs, well, they are amazing. I just cannot believe that there is someone who I've gotten into so well. Songs like "Modern Way" are dynamic, and with its steady pace and cowbells, is hard not to fall in love with. Besides, it's got a catchy chorus.A lot of the record is. I mean, do I need to even tell you to listen to a song called "Every Day I Love You Less and Less"? I mean, that's 100% greatness, from its keyboards, and it's one of the best responses to a breakup ever. It shows that these guys are clever and you gotta respect them for that. I'm surprised "I Predict a Riot" wasn't more popular, one of the also memorable songs here. Each song is done well, and it's got like the coolest liner notes as well. I say that if you like Britpop, clever songs, and something you can enjoy, this record is for you. And I'm only a fairweather Britpop fan, so think if it from that perspective.Oh, and I can tell you I like them a lot more than Kasabian.

That title says it all. This band were hyped, but for what? It sounds like something that would have possibly been written off if it came out in the late '70s. I don't mind the rockin', but I heard it done a lot better on an album called "Appetite for Destruction" by a band called Guns 'N Roses. And while I know it's supposed to be fun, that's not what I get out of listening to these guys.Sure, there's tons of better bands than Nickelback, but this of all bands? Hmmm.. It's one of those albums that doesn't really have peaks and valleys. Sometimes it's okay but the thing isn't really original at all. However, I suppose that some people will actually love this. Considering that this style isn't being done near as much these days I say that if you want some more that you should go ahead and buy it.I just don't really like it. For one thing, that riffage seems rather lame to me, something that died for a good reason. It's a little bit hard for me to get into the lead singer's voice. At one point he sounds like Robert Smith, next he sounds like a dead ringer for Spinal Tap. They also attempt irony. However a band who does the thing a lot better of the modern day is Tenacious D. I don't really mind too many of the retro revivalists, but bands like this and Jet do nothing at all for me. That's all.

Radiohead's fourth studio album, "Kid A", is one of those albums where everybody's got their opinion. It's usually an absolute one, too. I'm probably one of those who is more on the side that absolutely loves this album. While I am slightly more partial to "OK Computer", to me that's only slightly, but there's more to say about it. While some may argue that it wasn't very groundbreaking or anything, if it wasn't a radical departure, I think it'd be a much more middle-of-the-road perceived record; the "Kid A" fans liking it less and the haters hating it less... Anyway, I remember listening to this album because before this I did not like Radiohead at all. I went to the store to see what the fuss was about, and from hearing the first note of the record, I was certainly intrigued.It is an amazing record, complete with the Nigel Godrich production. No, you won't get the more streamlined rock songs of "The Bends", but this album has a lot to offer. Starting off with the synth-laden "Everything in its Right Place", this thing is one of those albums that's nice to chill out to. Lots of vocal effects, but interesting. The next track does the vocal effects too, but this time around it's much less telligible, but interesting avant-garde nonetheless.But that's not really where the album peaks. There are two real gems from the album which make it worth owning. There's the bass-and-horn driven "The National Anthem" which will have you pressing repeat and then there's the quintessential "Kid A" track, "Idioteque". The beats are nice to hear and there's just something about it that's great. Although I thought Thom's falsetto was weird initially, it definitely fits with the music.Elsewhere, there's the near-ambient instrumental "Treefingers", which while not anything special is a nice chill-out track. As is the album closer, the somewhat theatrical "Motion Picture Soundtrack". It's interesting as it sounds like it's going to be over but builds back a little bit, creating a sort of climax, just before ending.Guitars are far and few between, which is really surprising for a band that has three members who play guitar. But where they exist, they are pretty good like in the acoustic "How to Dissapear Completely", a nice track about dreaming. It's also got Thom's easier-to-acquire vocals, in his normal tenor range. While the most commercial, "Optimistic" has a good message from the band that is also somewhat simple. It isn't as interesting as the other tracks from the record but it is okay. While I have opinions on the other track and could maybe explain, I don't think I could do it without sounding vague and repetitive.But this album is an interesting one the first time you hear it, no matter what you listen to. This is the closest to the electronic stuff that they delved into, and since this album every subsequent Radiohead album has borrowed some from "Kid A". It's disappointing somewhat that they weren't ambitious enough to try and create even more ground, but what you get here is solid and worth being in your CD player. And no, you don't really need to be intellectual to listen to it. You just need to enjoy listening to stuff while you lay down or have an open mind. One of the two. I've given people my copy of the album and they all seemed to enjoy it.

Being "too young" to really follow that much music when this was out in 1995, it was like seven years later that I finally got to hear this band. And for almost three years, the only song I knew from them was "I Got a Girl". My friend got me into this band through this and "Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb". Not a bad album by any means, but the latter is certainly a better album.I hate to say this about an artist I like a lot, but about half of the songs sound like they were required to be made by the record label. Additionally, it's a somewhat unfocused album, with songs like "Same Dress, New Day" and "Trip Along" which both don't fit well in the context and are a bit dated. Additionally there's a lot of stuff that you'll try to get yourself into rather than actually enjoy.But why exactly is this a four-star album to me? Well, there are its fair share of pretty good tracks, and the bad could be a whole lot worse. But it's somewhat listenable, even. Originally I would have just given it three stars, but "Prick" is enough of a reason to buy the album. Nine minutes long and the closest thing to metal they've ever done, it's great. Still, they don't sacrifice the generally happy tone that's usually in Tim Delaughter's songs. It's the part after the guitar solo that I love so much, although this is a reason that some may miss the guitarist, Wes. He had a Billy Corgan-type quality to playing the guitar and this was his "Cherub Rock".One other good thing here is some of the lyrics, like the melodic "Motivation". Elsewhere, "I Got a Girl", which you've probably heard, is really clever and still has not gotten old. Even if I wish people could acknowledge more from the band. I sort of like "Rocketpop", "Bang", "Piranha", and the catchy-yet-quirky "Raindrop". Also, I particularly enjoy "High", another track that shows the great guitar ability they had and Tim has a Brian Wilson-type falsetto here.More of its strengths are in the last two tracks than anything else, and unfortunately there are a lot of tracks that are barely above average. I think I'd recommend "Jesus" over this if you like the Polyphonic Spree and would like to hear what Tim did in Tripping Daisy. However, for what it's worth, it's a nice blend of psychedelic and punk-pop with occasional other things.

I've been a fan of the White Stripes for five years, and I find at least with the full-length records that they can pretty much do no wrong. I tended to embrace both the earlier blues rock/garage sound and the art rock onGet Behind Me Satan, a range which showed how versatile the band is. They sound very electrified here and that is a good thing for me. As usual, the songs are all about as good as they could possibly be.I've always thought Jack was effortless with the blues, and it's as present here almost as much asDe Stijl. The title track is probably my single of the year, with the awesome pounding bass sound of Meg's spare beat and the insanity of the instrumental music. There is a diversity here and if you hoped for Meg to do some vocal work, it can be found here. "St. Andrew" is kind of the reprise of the finger-pick "Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn," but that's a track that's more spoken than sung. Both tracks go complete with bagpipes. -- unheard of on the previous five records! The latter mentioned track goes nicely for those who like something in the "Little Ghost" vein.For me, other highlights are an amazing cover of "Conquest" which even has a siren/toy machine gun-esque bridge and I really like the chorus of "I'm Slowly Turning Into You." "Effect and Cause" shows that Jack White still has the lyricism in him. This is the sound of rejuvenation; it's like they really had a mojo workin' on this record. It's intense fun and just about anything you've liked about the group can be found here, with a few new added stuff that's also a nice change of pace. You may not enjoy it the first time around, but oh well oh well oh well (makes sense in the context of "Little Cream Soda").While I thought the Raconteurs were a kind of average yet occasionally enjoyable pop group, that band probably makes this release all the more exciting. I'm glad these guys aren't defunct, and maybe won't be soon. Not too many guys hit the mark each time like they do. And unlike most "return to form" albums, they remember what drew listeners in the first place.

I guess this was RCA's attempt to cash in on the name Lit, who apparently weren't going to be that successful anymore. First things first, why make a compilation when it's only going to have two of a band's albums? That seems rather unnecessary.I have to admit though, I would like something to be out there that gives Lit a name like their actual albums do. For one thing, they are 5000 times better than elitists make them out to be. In spite of being lumped with blink-182, they did not really sound very similar (and also were a lot more mature and clever lyrically). Maybe because they had a Green Day influence, but that is seriously the only thing I can think of.The songs themselves are pretty decent. There is only one song that doesn't appear on other albums called "The Party's Over". It's a standard Lit fair: clever lyrics that are likely more intersting than the music, although, the difference this time is that it's a lot better than anything from "Atomic".But that's one thing. They could have at least reminded people of where Lit were when they made "Tripping the Light Fantastic". That album shows that they are much more than just pop tarts, and I don't think you'd ever say that with a straight face about the album.In addition, they add two variations of songs; the "Happy in the Meantime" remix, which doesn't add much from the great original (one of the few standout tracks on "Atomic") and an acoustic "Down". I must admit, I like this version and it's a nice change of pace from the electric-based original.Also on the goodside, it does collect most of the necessary tracks from "Atomic". In fact, I may suggest this rather than "Atomic" if it didn't seem like such a cash cow attempt. There's the clever "Addicted" which will make Simple Plan fans never want to hear the song by them of the same title ever again (as well as "Miserable", which was also much more clever).But my main problem is that this adds very little. In fact I'd say that if you have Lit's albums just to burn the ones that you don't have. And even though the singles matter more to some, I thought "A Place in the Sun" was solid and lacked any real filler (although not classic). But if you don't own "Atomic", just buy this because otherwise you'll have to sit through songs that you don't really care for and make little impression. So it all depends on where you heard Lit from. If they waited for, say, a few other albums to be included in contextation, I'm sure this would be a lot more satisfying to fans like me.

You know something I notice with movies directed by Rob Cohen that have Vin Diesel in them? NONE of them have real plots in them; they are all more of crowd pleasers. This is no exception. If you like visuals, you will love this movie. But if you are looking for some actual good action movies, I suggest you look elsewhere (lots of recommended titles that I'd rather not list). Really, I found it hard to just keep on watching this because there's nothing that made me think "Wow!" when I was amazed, except that so many people actually wanted to see this. Although I don't necessarily recommend it either, XXX also is quite lame and is more about seeing the explosion than an actual coherent story. I don't think I'd want to shell out money for this.On the good side, "Sin City" just came out a couple days ago.

Like many, my first exposure to Lupe was through his verse on Kanye West's "Touch the Sky," possibly my favorite track on his second album, "Late Registration." However, what really piqued my interest was when I heard "Kick, Push" the album's first single. I liked the production, his rhymes, and the subject matter was kind of refreshing for me. I've found that most hip-hop has gone downhill and hasn't connected to me like it did in 1998 when I first started following music. There are moments, and to tell you the truth, I wouldn't even call it the most innovative album of the decade. If you want more of that, go and check out Blackalicious' "Blazing Arrow." But it's just rare that I thought I'd ever hear a record like this. For me, a dream come true.And while some artists have nice lyrics but awful delivery and production, "Food & Liquor" is not victim of such. In fact, I think people who don't even care for hip-hop would enjoy the record. There is a little something on here for everyone. And actually, I don't even know how to view certain tracks as better than others, that's how good this is. And in spite what I said earlier, it is still quite refreshing. And some of the samples I really enjoy, like in "Daydreamin'," which I last heard interpolated in Beta Band's "Squares." Also, if it seems as if too many artists these days are focused on guests and such, this should be a relief as most of the songs have mostly Lupe's flow and while there are some on here, it doesn't distract it from the quality of the album. Sometimes it even actually adds to the songs.It's not intellegence-insulting, the thing that's really drifted me away from the hip-hop genre to begin with, but it's catchy and playful enough for mainstream kids to enjoy, too. I really wonder what he'll turn out with next; this record really is THAT good. There are artists you can compare him to, but he's also unique enough to be separated from the peers. This is an actual album that belongs in your stereo and to stay there, not to be sold for countless used copies of the albums. I didn't get it when it first came out because it was delayed so much & I put interest in other artists, but I'm glad I came around to this.

And it's not only in hip-hop that this happened. In this kind of sense, N.W.A. can be seen as sort of the Sex Pistols of hip-hop. But whereas the Pistols were known more about with stage antics and whatnot, it was what was actually on the record what most people mentioned of with N.W.A. The first album, "N.W.A. and the Posse", was not anywhere as notorious as this album, and I haven't heard it, but while I feel like they try to be seen as more sincere and hardcore than they really are, what stands out is the overall message of the songs. (I'd really give it 3 1/2, but given the usual current garbage out now, I'm gonna have to round it up). It's known for the tracks which are unapologetic about the violence put on to others. While I personally prefer others, like Ice-T to these guys, the album has very little filler, so its strengths are outweighed by the weaknesses.It's catchy enough for casual listeners to sink into basically admittedly. People who haven't heard it probably do at least know who Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E are. The others are relatively talented too (in fact, MC Ren here is on par with Ice Cube). The production here isn't as good as, say, the Bomb Squad, but there's great beats on songs like "Dopeman". I like songs like "Express Yourself" and "Gangsta Gangsta", because those tend to stand out. While some may mention the "whining" of the record, to me, if an artist has a REAL reason to do so, why not just go ahead. It does talk about the ghetto life and whatnot, and while they know that they do things that are seen as irresponsible, they do not care (or at least according to the album, they don't). I don't buy into that this got people to say what they wanted to or whatever, but what I care more about is SONGS. And plenty of them are good.While ultimately there are views, etc., I disagree about, there are records that I can listen to that express those views, most notably in A Tribe Called Quest.

To be honest, I fully was aware that Thom's album was available but had no interest in buying it when it was released. I love Radiohead, but that doesn't mean I'm a huge enough Thom Yorke fan to buy his solo stuff. In fact, I'm more impressed with Johnny Greenwood's guitar playing and Phil Selway's drumming, and while sometimes Thom sounds great, I feel like sometimes he plays notes that don't fit his register.Also, this has been compared to "Kid A" and "Amnesiac" for being an electronic record. This is definitely the work of Thom and producer Nigel Godrich, but one difference is that it is less varied and arguably much more consistent than those two. I love "Kid" but I felt "Amnesiac" was hit-or-miss. Fortunately, nothing seems to dissonant or startling on here, and Thom sounds in tune through pretty much the whole recording. It is a political album, but not as explicitly so as "Hail to the Theif" was.It is 9 tracks, all of 'em electronic. "Black Swan" is probably the most user-friendly track here. I was surprised that I found this one to even be refreshing. It isn't terribly pretentious, something I fully expected out of someone from Radiohead (I love 'em, but they are pretentious). So if you keep in mind that this is Thom and not Radiohead, the fact that it's not as varied sonically and such, this will be a fun listen.

If you're collecting NIN, you may have heard some of this already. That's because for most part, two-thirds of these tracks ended up on "The Fragile". Yes, they are somewhat different, but that'd be my reason for convincing someone to get this. It is quite cheap, even at used places, so that's also a plus.The original "Day" is a great track which is kind of like My Bloody Valentine in structure. I really love the instrumental parts, even the sad-sounding verses. I also like the bridge, which is ambient with some mandolin included. Then it becomes a scat-fest until it ends. Only slightly shorter than the album."Starf***ers, Inc." is not that much different. I think it was the worst song on "The Fragile" but still quite great. There are more shouts and a KISS sample, if that helps.What really makes this worth seeking after is the "quiet" remix of "Day". I would not spend my money on those overpriced "Together" imports anyway, since this one is not too bad and gives it a nice, more piano-based feel. It's one of the greatest mixes of a NIN song and for this you will find that you'll like what you paid for.May not be in print, but worth seeking after just for that one song. Oh, and if you find a vinyl version, it has this really good remix of "Day" done by Porter Ricks. That's worth seeking after as well.

My first encounters with Shiny Toy Guns was whenever I had heard the singles "Le Disko" and "You Are the One," which I fell in love with both of those. Paired with the fact that the album was sold pretty cheaply, I figured I'd give 'em a shot, and boy am I ever glad that I did.It's really clear with the two previous demo editions that Shiny Toy Guns were trying to make this album the best that they possibly could. And with that the songs really start to pay off for listeners. The group could make songs that are trendy and superficial, little depth and even those tend to move the listener. "Le Disko" is proof of this, an electro-clash song with some intense lyrics to match the music. Carah Faye's vocals generally move the listener, and I notice some people are split between her and Chad Petree's vocals, but I'm fine with both. Her performances on "Jackie Will Save Me" and the title track are wonderful, though. I couldn't even imagine the song without her on the former; it's really what puts life in the song.And then there's some more heartfelt performances, like the awesome "You Are the One," which was good enough to get me to buy this. Just as moving as anything from the Killers and Hot Hot Heat, the track took me in immediately. Many of the melodies feel familiar without seeming so clich&eacute; or watered down. They have an interesting feel; it's a great nocturnal album. Another real highlight is the gorgeous "Waiting," which is one of the less talked about tracks from the record and gives it as much depth as the others.I can think of many worse ways to spend ten bucks than to hear something that's one-hundred percent enjoyable, music that you find hard to stand still to but doesn't make you antsy; it just makes you move. The record hasn't been out of my CD player much during the year. There is some backlash already, but that happens with every band with success.

Okay, so in spite the title, the record isn't really bad. However, in spite the glowing reviews of praise, it isn't anything extraordinary or even ground-breaking for that matter. There are too many bands to name of the past 25+ years who played "post-punk" that played in a similar vein to this group. Yet for some reason people go ga-ga on this. I suppose it's another case of the guys being British, and critics just love those kinds of bands. The comparisons to the Strokes made a lot of sense when it was out, as they merely worked better for the release time than actually had a whole lot of verve going on.There is a certain style to the tracks, I have to admit. It's fairly catchy and not that hard to get into. I particularly am a fan of the lead single "Take Me Out," with its minute-long intro having a classic melody and then it goes into its dance-rock mode for the rest of the song. While I'm kind of glad the hi-hat has been brought back into music during the type of "in" indie music of the past few years, I've heard other bands pull this off in a much more interesting manner. The tracks are fine enough, but can also be a bit redundant and can get old after awhile. There are other moments that I like and it's entertaining so I guess it can work for you. And some of those moments include things like the opening chords of "40" and the record was nicely enough produced.I suppose it will work for you but while entertaining, it's not that special at all. It seems that in its context people don't even remember the record quite as well as when it was first released.

During 1992 in the release of Broken, Reznor, was still in between the way of the top dog when rising from underdog status. Lollapalooza started the popularization of NIN from alternative fans, and it got more of a word-of-mouth hype. Enough to convert people on time, but also Trent claimed how he wanted to get rid of the O.G. fans, and this was the result.People obviously still loved Broken. It's an awesome, short, accessible album of hard-edged NIN music. Sure it's loud, but so are a million other albums out there. And this isn't really for those who don't like that stuff. And I bet it'd work to scare someone near sleeping by playing "Happiness in Slavery". That'd just be funny! But it's a great song, and the lyrics are great too, as they condemn comformity without using any hypocrisy *unlike those corporate "punk" bands today*, and it has cool sounds in it, especially the bridge part.The guitars on Broken are perfect as well. They're equally rock and syntheseised. They roar over the keyboards. While it's seen as a big difference, it's not a complete surprise for everyone. Some guitar notes on "Last" resemble "Head Like A Hole" from PHM, but it's still great, and Trent's shouts turn out great."Pinion" is a cool-sounding intro, that starts out very quiet in volume despite a rather crunchy guitar riff, and the sound doesn't get louder until the last notes, part of which even fades into "Wish". Can't go wrong with that. Trent sings fast on this one, and it turns out awesome. It's a real angry song, so it's good for if you like that sort, as well as the rest of the album."Help Me I Am In Hell" is an awesome interlude/whatever you call it. It sounds completely different from anything here, and kind of predicts the Downward Spiral/Fragile sounds on there."Gave Up" is the depression-anger sort of track. It is as just about as good as the other ones.The hidden ones, I applaud Trent for doing that. They don't quite hold up to the first tracks (while they're still great) and the "Physical (You're So)" cover isn't quite as New Wave as the original, but if you like most alternative music in general, you may like both versions. "Suck" is the rendition of the Pigface song he sung on being put on a NIN album. Haven't heard the Pigface version though. Cool intro though.It doesn't really sound like any of the other albums from NIN, and if you like to hear crazy noise, you may like the overlooked Fixed remix album. But if you like that, you should check this one out.

Of the "downward spiral" era singles, while this was not as good as one of the singles that came later, it is very good. It was a good taster for that album and includes the menacing, excellent original. It's one of NIN's greatest songs, and perhaps one of the greatest I've heard. I especially like the intensity, and even when it goes in synth-programmed mode of the "all the pigs are all lined up part", then it gets into a piano part asking, "now doesn't it make you feel better?" Indeed. Then it builds up to do the same again.The b-sides are all really good, too. Two of the remixes are of "Reptile", both actually kind of entertaining to listen to, and are even longer than the original song!. Then there's also the somewhat filler track "A Violet Fluid" which is somewhat interesting in spite that, plus a remix of "Pigs", which is a quite good track in its remixed form.Definitely one worth picking up. Oh, and the "downward spiral" re-issue is similarly good.

I am not generally a fan of remixes and don't really check them out unless I'm pretty fond of an artist. Fortunately in this case, it is great. Calling NIN industrial is a bit of a stretch, but not this EP. You get a bunch of good things for a nice price. Two remixes exist of both "Wish" and "Happiness in Slavery", the latter which has a great remix in the pounding "Slave Screams" version. The regular "Wish" remix is great as well.It starts out greatly though with a remix of "Gave Up" that is perhaps even better than the original. It sounds really insane because it is really insane. It's like listening to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music', because some people are scared to admit to liking it although it's a masterpiece. This and 'Further Down the Spiral' are great buys.

Although this doesn't leave much for the non-fans of "Closer", I think that this single is brilliant. Full of many "Closer" remixes, they are all great and worthy of repeat listens. My favorite of these is the "precursor" remix. It's a nice way to start things and is a great way to hear a more dark beginning of the album.I rarely would consider giving five stars to a single, but this is one of the few exceptions (another one is "1979" by the Smashing Pumpkins, in any form). Each of these remixes are worthy of someone who likes something like this. I can see why this was used for 'Seven'. Then there's a great Marc Bell cover which shows a great side of Trent, always new-wave influenced.It's a wonder why "March of the F**kheads" wasn't included on the MOTP single, but that is also worth buying. Pretty much, if you like the Downward Spiral, I suggest you pick up all the things done in that era because they are all worth picking up.

As many know, "Rubber Soul" was a big turning point for the Beatles and will always be remembered. It was also the first of the albums where they did not take advice from the producers, and the results were pretty good! Although their best works were still behind them ("Revolver" and "Abbey Road,") this was quite good. There is a number of hits and it shows part of the diverse creativity of the group.Some of the works here are just gorgeous, like the Greek-influenced "Michelle" and the melodic "Girl." There are lots of catchy songs throughout this record. And then, possibly the greatest track here is "Nowhere Man," an unpretentious commentary of someone who's not yet viewed as a major asset. The song's melody and message make it what it is. Yes, there's a bigger folk-rock influence like in "Norwegian Wood," but that's actually something they did quite well. Other great songs include "You Won't See Me" and "The Word," which are others that you'll sing along with and not get tired of.The only track on here that I did not like was Ringo's "What Goes On." He was a good enough drummer, but I always felt that a lot of the weakest Beatles songs were the ones he sang on. I guess it's also a bit too country for my taste, and I don't really like his voice. Maybe that's just my problem, though.Overall though, "Rubber Soul" is an excellent album that will still connect with people from now, even. And people like them 'cos the music's great, not because they "have to" like it. And you don't, but you're at less of a loss if you do.

And actually, my sister originally had a copy of it first. While there are some who do not like it I feel that song by song it is a very solid album. The hits were very catchy, yet they weren't ubiquitous, which was really nice. I have to admit that I listen to songs like "N***a What, N***a Who" and "Can I Get A..." more than the rest of the tracks, although I have an appreciation for the rest as well. The album isn't quite perfect, hence my rating, but I think you'll find it a worthwhile listen and buy.

I am one of those people who got into the White Stripes in the midst of the "White Blood Cells" hype in spring '02. While I think that they are certainly more deserving of the hype than a New York band who plays average music, the White Stripes are always above average. I found this through listening to their back catalog and I find this even through their current stuff. They clearly are not running out of ideas. Where "Elephant" was a half-counterpart to "White Blood Cells" (half because we didn't see it coming that we'd be tricked into thinking Jack was playing bass and the actuality of Meg singing lead and there being a seven-minute track), "Get Behind Me Satan" more often than not goes into some new Stripes territory."Blue Orchid" is a classic White Stripes track, and single, even. It's loud, catchy, and what's interesting is that this time around Jack uses his falsetto more effectively than any time on the first four Stripes records. At only two-and-a-half minutes, it was a nice track that will be remembered over time.The rest of the album is comparably different. I thought "White Blood Cells" was their most varied, but it's kind of hard to give that nod given the variety here. While there's also a country song in "Little Ghost", this isn't the energetic Stones-like track you may have expected on a White Stripes record. In fact it is more in line with his "Cold Mountain" contributions than anything else. It's a nice track, however.Meg does take lead again. This time it's much shorter and while not quite as good, still fun and with a good and simple message. The 35 second track is quite fun to listen to. "Passive Manipulation" is kind of benefited on album location as well. It feels fine as the predecessor track of "Take, Take, Take".Elsewhere, the mariamba-and-piano influence is notable among listening to "Satan". One of these that will be remembered for the right reasons is "The Denial Twist", a track that gets stuck in your head for awhile and is executed just right. Then there's the piano use of the single "My Doobell", possibly the most playful track on the record, but you don't expect it to come up front as much as what happens on "Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)", the closest thing to a "This Protector" you get on here. But that is also a good thing, as it still manages to be its own track, and shows Jack White's great songwriting.There are its flaws in places, I must admit. None of these are major enough for me to deduct an entire star from my rating. For one thing, that distortion that comes in on "The Nurse" is kind of annoying and unnecessary and is my least favorite song on the record. It is not quite as consistent as "De Stijl", but it's just fine. If you like the White Stripes, buy.

While some are quick to try to compare this album to Fugazi, there was no Fugazi when there was Minor Threat. Instead, this was the beginning of D.C. hardcore punk done at its best. That would seem like a stretch to some, but the tracks were not even meant to make a difference, yet did somehow anyway. If it were all about not having casual sex, drinking, smoking, or drug use, it wouldn't be the full mile of what makes it so great (although that's one factor that does). Minor Threat are capable of good songs, and you get 26 of them on this disc.And only a handful of tracks are about what's mentioned above. What's misunderstood is that "Straight Edge" was not even a scene until people liked the message so much in the song. Only forty-five seconds, it was moving enough anyway. Many of the really short songs are also the easiest to get into. And then, if you live in D.C., you know how racially divided it is there, so it's nice to hear a track like "Guilty of Being White", which is an ode at being blamed for being racist (and causing slavery) for simply being white. And you get one that they even kid themselves on the band's antics, "Cashing In", something people have always wanted to accuse Ian's future band of doing. It also is a no-BS record, which makes me love it so much. You don't even have to be punk to like it, I know that I am not!It is a compilation which was created so you could buy all of this for a low price as opposed to having to still cash out money for the two EPs (tracks 1-8; 11-15), Out of Step (15-23), and the "Salad Days" single (24-26). You get it all here, and the records are still sought after, since they've since become the punk thing... vinyl format. To me, that's what also makes it five stars is that Minor Threat have a lot of greatness in that it's just about enjoying the music. Not to mention both songs from the Flex Your Head compilation album appear here.

You know something, I've encountered many Fugazi fans who think that this is one of their best albums. But I sort of don't get it. On the surface, it should be awesome: it's got the hardcore in post-hardcore, but at the same time, I feel like it is never memorable, and that's what made stabs at it like13 SongsandRepeater + 3 Songsmuch more fun to listen to and more convincing for that matter.Is it bad? No, it's actually pretty decent. Which is probably why I still have a copy of it, in spite the fact that I like both the aforementioned records AND the later more artistic albums likeRed MedicineandThe Argument. The lyrics are still interesting like most Fugazi, and I guess that "Great Cop" does actually appeal to me. But it's one of those things you hear and don't feel a lot towards. Maybe it was harder to get into for being before my time, but so were three of the four that I mentioned that I like so much more than this record. It's just pretty midling when you get to how you really are with the songs. That actually makes giving a well thought out review for this album a bit harder for me than the ones that I love and a few that I really dislike.I suppose if you want something with more energy you'll enjoy this, and it's not like I'm doing a very good job at stopping you from it either. But I look at it more skeptically than the rest of their work. Yes, the integrity is still there but I just don't find a lot in it. Or maybe I could try to give my copy to someone who does.

I don't know what it is that I enjoy so much about "Frances the Mute," the second LP by the Mars Volta, to be honest. This is usually not a sort of record I'd enjoy. I guess I like the Fugazi-inspired at the drive-in and "De-Loused" enough for me to also be more open-minded to this sort of thing. It is prog & then it isn't. I like it somewhat less than the debut, but that does not mean that this isn't worth a listen. It is. The slower numbers tend to be more dread and depressing, but for me, the highlights are where there Latin roots come out. The first part of "Cygnus" is repeated at the end, which sort of makes me wonder if they were inspired by the likes of "Animals" by Pink Floyd whenever making this. That's a great part of the album, though. The guys do seem a little bit pretentious, but for some reason that does not bug me. And in spite the long length of the songs, you can find hooks all over the album.However, one thing that sort of bugs me is that just to stop the record label from marketing the album as an EP, they had to stretch "Cassandra Geminni" over in eight tracks. It just doesn't make sense to listen to these out of their order and context, for me at least. Track 6 even sounds like it is supposed to start somewhere from the last track. That's even a wonderful track, but I think it weighs down the album a bit. "Cygnus" was breathtaking for me, it reminded me of listening to the Refused's B-side "Poetry Written in Gasoline" on the part where the tempo began changing. And if you like the stuff to be more depressing, you can have it with "The Widow" and the beautiful "Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore." I guess there's something the band pulls off that makes the album aurally pleasing. And then there's the moving centrepiece, "L'Via L'Viaquez," which shows their Latin sound the most both in most of the lyrics and in the progressions. The group has moved the right direction on here. Someday I will try the new album.I recommend this album to anyone with enough of an open mind. It may take patience to truly enjoy the album, but it will come to you. Enjoy it.

Okay, I'll admit one thing: This album has some really great tracks. "Pride" in particular is totally classic, one of their greatest even now. Its arena rock stab works well with a really big sound and good message. Other highlights are in "Wire" and "Indian Summer Sky." The title track is actually kind of memorable and is well made musically. It is not really their most well-aged either. I prefer "War" and "Actung Baby" by miles, even the debut "Boy" to this. The songs aren't that bad but they just aren't that interesting. In spite having one of the greatest U2 songs ever, this is just an album to me, nothing more & nothing less.

What can be said that already hasn't been said? I don't think there's much. This must have REALLY seemed ground-breaking at the time: Backbeats that sometimes recall hip-hop elements and some real soaring, soulful vocals from Beth Gibbons. There's not a single bad song on here, and it's most famous for the awesome "Sour Times," which sounds at times like a James Bond theme with certain elements. Then there's "Numb" which is probably my favorite song on the album, real soulful vocals there. You get more blues-rockin' moments like on the record's closer "Glory Box." There's occasional samples which rule and sound neat like everything else. If you haven't heard "Dummy" yet you are in for a real treat. Pretty much everyone who owns it can tell you that it's well worth the hype. It is beautiful and proves electronic music CAN BE full of emotion. Even today, it doesn't sound dated at all. I like the follow-up album too, but advise this as your start.

And one of my top thirty, maybe even twenty favorites of all-time. I used to be more of a fan of the subgenre until I started getting disappointed in some of it and I was getting into more alternative/rock stuff. Even with that it has not waned my interest of this album. While there's some rapping from all of them, you also hear some hints of reggae and soul, both done well and with some excellent production. I was so glad when I heard that they were reuniting. While I like Wyclef's solo stuff alright and enjoyed Lauryn's album, it would be nice to hear more from them. The covers of Roberta Flack and Bob Marley are nicely done, but you should also listen to the original songs that they do hear; all are presented well.The skits are not really my favorites but seem to serve a purpose, and are usually just put at the end of most of the songs anyway. Discussed in most of these songs are social issues, and this record is kind of a commentary of that. It doesn't come off as pretentious in the least bit, which makes it nice. The two remixes of "Fu-Gee-La" are okay with me, particularly because that's my favorite song from the album. Then there's "Mista, Mista" which is mainly just Wyclef and the guitar. The instrumentation on this album is nice; I wish that was how it was more often (although the instrumentation of "Killing Me Softly" in parts is not all that different from what A Tribe Called Quest had several years back on the classic "Bonita Applebum"). Even the samples are nice, like the Enya one that others are also trying to sample in their songs. Pras has good rapping skills as well in spite of the fact that he doesn't generally stand out to the people as much as the other two. This album still is frequently repeated by me even today.

When Staind released 'Dysfunction' in 1999, I had caught on to the band and ended up enjoying what I heard from them. While the album didn't have much of a variety and was kind of short it was pretty good, one of the standout albums of the nu-metal subgenre. I haven't got a hold of the debut, online-only 'Tormented', but I'd like to look out for that some day. This expands on Aaron's personal turmoil and relationships. It's a pretty good album, even though far from perfect.The highpoints include the opener "Open Your Eyes" which is classic Staind. While heavy it also has its melodic points and can get stuck in your head. In a good way, too. Similarly I enjoy songs like "Pressure". "Epiphany" is the ballad that is not a "power" ballad but one that has him presenting his emotion in the best way possible.The only problem is that I'm not too crazy about the "power" ballads and I had to hear those so many times. I liked the melodies at first, but overplay made me realize the flaws of each of those songs. Some of them are too obvious and theme and just about all of them are rewrites of "Home", yet more overproduced, making it harder to listen to over and over again. "Outside" was better left acoustic, in spite of Durst, because here the emotion just isn't presented as well and is kind of bland when presented here. As are all of the power ballads.Even though I talked about more of the negative things I actually have a generally favorable impression of this album, even though I prefer its predecessor. After hearing the snoozefest of '14 Shades of Grey' though I don't know if I want to buy future Staind albums. I'd rather keep the money in my wallet for something I'd enjoy more.

Man, it's mind-blowing how good Tool has gotten with the past few albums. The "Opiate" EP was decent, but on "Undertow" there came improvement and the next two albums proved the band was at amazing things. Those records deserved each bit of success that they got. I don't know if I'd recommend this thing to someone who didn't like "Lateralus," but for everyone else: This release is just as strong as the past two. Each song on here is wonderful, even the interludes being nice enough on here. "Lost Keys" is beautiful in the music, even if I don't particularly care for the patient/doctor dialogue to be honest. The second half of this album shows growth in the band, with interesting percussion through "Right in Two" and possibly their trippiest track yet with "Intension," which is quieter without feeling forced. Another growth is in the single "The Pot." When I first heard that, I thought, "Who's that singing in the intro?" On top of that, the whole album shows that Tool's musicianship has not died down from the years. "Wings for Marie (Pt. 1)" and "10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2)" are an amazing piece together, showing a maturity and emotion through the track. True, people won't all enjoy Tool, but they're all simply missing out. Those of us who do, let's enjoy what they're indulging in the music.

You know, there was a time when I really hated U2's more "Americanized" phase. This is basically the work they did in the mid and late '80s in particular and I always felt at once like it was ill-fated and arrogant. I hadn't yet touched this album, either. And then later on I recognized some of it wasn't bad at all.The Joshua Treewas the greatest thing the guys had done by the point it was out but for awhile I always was more into the post-punk early records and the electronic later work, and some of the new stuff too. The band has shown though that they can pull that type of thing off and that it's really even entertaining at times. Most U2 stuff is.I heard a lot of bad rap about the album. So when I found it recently for only FIVE bucks used, I was somewhat skeptical. Only "somewhat" because I was aware of "All I Want Is You" which is one of my favorite U2 songs and "Desire" and "Angel of Harlem" were pretty good songs as well.I don't really consider this a studio album, if that makes any sense. It's a compilation of sorts, with some being live and some studio, and two interludes that technically aren't even U2. There's enough studio work to make a long EP or a short album, which the album could have done if that was what they wanted to. And also it may have been more effective with the length. Although I would have liked less of the gospel choir in the song I otherwise found the live "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" to be fantastic, and the live "Pride (In the Name of Love)" is pretty well done as well. Although not included I think they could have put a version of something like "Trip Through Your Wires" since the song itself sounds like something that would appear on here. They also do a B-side and a cover, but those are both awfully performed on here. "Helter Skelter" and "Silver and Gold" have better versions available and the commentary on both of those songs is pretty embarassing.Not really perfect. Also, there's other ill-fated moments like the failed John Lennon response song "God, Part II." Its intentions were probably good but everything else about the song is just failed, in general. Oh, the live "All Along the Watchtower" wasn't special either, not on par with Dylan and especially not as good as the Hendrix version. Speaking of which one of those "interludes" I mentioned was his rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner," probably the band's nod to Americanism, but I don't mind since it's a cool rendition. "Bullet the Blue Sky" (which inspired the project's name) isn't really my favorite but it's about as good performed live as it is on "The Joshua Tree."Oh, and "All I Want Is You" is just an amazing way to close the album. It's probably the song that makes the record worth owning, with a very emotional performance that shows they were pretty good with the more personal songs as well. "Desire" is the really big single from the album and is nice to listen to even now. More of a western feel than most of it but not bad. "Angel of Harlem" is a nice melodic piece reminiscent of "The Joshua Tree" even if not particularly special.A lot of the album is really in between. It's an interesting record, though. For example you do get one song with the Edge on the vocals and it's a pretty decent song, too ("Van Diemen's Land"). The only studio song that was really pretty bad was "Hawkmoon 269"; I guess it's just too bad that one was on the earlier half of the record.This record is definitely not for everyone and it's a mixed bag in pretty much any definition of the term, but I recommend this to people who are willing to get into more U2. As a guy who wasn't conceived until a few months following "Joshua Tree"'s release, there's some younger fans who may seek this. It goes in all directions but if you don't mind any of the types of songs that are in here even in spite my warnings I suggest you give it a try and you may enjoy it.

Look, I love QOTSA. I haven't heard the debut album but the three records after that were all excellent and had a great playback value. I don't consider those perfect but even the flaws were very far and few between on those records.I had some fairly high expectations as well. I was FLOORED when I heard the single "Sick, Sick, Sick" and found it very intriguing. I especially liked the guitar during the chorus as well. I wasn't expecting a full album of that song but hoped the rest would be similarly good.But it really isn't very good. There are some good songs here, like "Make It Wit Chu" and to a lesser extent "Misfit Love," but I don't like having to spend time listening to songs that go NOWHERE, and that's exactly what happens on this record. I don't know how a listener could continually sit through "Into the Hollow" but I guess tastes really are subjective, and I don't like it. The bad isn't embarassing but really kind of irritating still. I don't like listening to songs where the ideas drag as I mentioned and I've repeatedly listened to these songs hoping that they'd grow on me. They haven't.If you're a casual or new fan I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you're a fan you probably will buy or have it. And at least the packaging is top-notch, the best I've seen this year. That's something clever that I actually did care for at least once around.

No, not every supergroup fails. Look at Fugazi. And as far as grunge bands go, look at Mad Season, although they were not perfect. Many other bands as well were decent enough. Sometimes making two great sounds can make a bombastic album. However, Audioslave manage to be something that neither Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden ever were: Bland corporate rock. These songs are not all dreadful, but you get the feeling after awhile that all of these songs are too similar and while it's really good the first time, you eventually realize that these songs are all by-the-numbers. The musicianship of each member is just as good as it was before but with Audioslave you get underwhelming results.Except for the exceptional "Shadow on the Sun", there isn't really anything worthy of note as far as good songs go. Some of those were already singles. I guess I was expecting a lot more from them. In spite of this corporate rock sound I actually do have respect for Audioslave. I just can't get why I can never get into them, as I have honestly tried.For a better supergroup album, try the one from Velvet Revolver. For albums of the artists, try Soundgarden's 'Badmotorfinger' and 'Superunknown' (then complete from there) and Rage's self-titled and 'Battle of Los Angeles' albums. I honestly haven't heard their new album but I think I'm not shelling any money out on that unless it's used or strongly discounted.

Well, I realize that there are many people who like this band and CKY mainly because of what they know of from the skateboarders from MTV (something which I like to avoid, but also sometimes find amusing). Well, I happen to think that CKY are a much better band, since they seem to know what a thing called hooks are. I also get where someone calling Placebo mediocre and praising this simultaneously is coming from, because they're one of my favorite bands, and while this isn't terrible, it's not really a great album, either.And actually, I was introduced in 2002 when an awesome alternative rock program played &quot;Join Me In Death&quot;, because I enjoyed the fact that it was melodic and actually did have an appeal to me. I even remember how a friend of mine wanted to get rid of this album, and technically, I only really have it because I knew how desperate he was to get rid of it.I am a fan of some goth, like Sisters of Mercy, Type O Negative, and bands like Icon of Coil, (and my all-time fav., VAST, if you count it), but I still don't see how this does a whole lot. However, I like the tracks where Vallo uses his voice in a more deep way, such as &quot;Gone With The Sin&quot;, which makes it kind of an awesome listen.The cover of &quot;Wicked Game&quot; doesn't do much for me, and in the end, Chris Isaak's is gonna be much more remembered, because that had an interesting western feel to it, and this just sounds like a wrongly-done mall cover (no offense). It reminds me of 311's &quot;Love Song&quot; in the way that they don't completely realize what the original had for depth. But I think they included it here because of theme.Also, I find a lot of the songs to be mildly cheesy. We realize that some of these songs are supposed to be gothy, but &quot;Your Sweet Six Six Six&quot; and stuff like that seem like they tried to make goth songs, although I give them credit for not thinking Marilyn Manson and Evanescence are what it's supposed to sound like (nothing against these artists, but that's not really what goth is). Some of the tracks here I find to be rather boring. Overall, I can see why that friend wanted to get rid of it. However, I like listening to stuff with more of a boom in it, and actual hooks. People say bands like Thursday lack it, and yet I can actually get into some of their stuff. There is a lot of better music than this.

Well, now they are back on an indie label, but Lit are nothing short of exciting on their first full-length album, "Tripping the Light Fantastic". If you're expecting the sunny pop-punk of the later two albums, "A Place in the Sun" and "Atomic", you might be disappointed. Oh well, once you get used to this album you'll find it's possibly the most fun album that they've done.One thing to check out is the early recording of "No Big Thing", which is done in a slightly more rough production and not quite in the same way as the polished "Place" version. This album has all types of sounds. The metal sound you hear that they like is heard in a few songs, even. I'm glad that the band re-found themselves recently, because this is just what Lit is all about. They make songs that have a bunch of flair and talent. Songs like "Bitter" have the clear Nirvana influence; elsewhere there are songs like "Habib" that are totally unique with great Lit melodies and then there's near-surf guitar riffage of "My World", with some really good melodies from them. The riff kind of reminds me of "Warped" by RHCP. It kind of reminds me of hardcore in some spots, like when A. Jay screams on "Amount to Nothing" and its rhythm break. "Dozer" starts out a bit toned down, and while a slower moment, does not lack any distortion. They still talk about their love for the "Cadillac", if you want some of that. This album is meant for repeat listens. The sound is varied yet totally focused. In fact the mixture of that shows their ability of great song writing. You may think they were an overnight band, but this proves here that's the last thing that Lit was.I think that I like it on the same level as "Sun", but I think that now I prefer the self-titled to this. To me, that's a continuation of what they were doing here, stripped of pressure from RCA (now they're on Nitrus) and Don Gilmore. The latter makes me proud because I personally feel that's why people think they "sold out" later. They are a band of their own and on here there is grunge, metal, hardcore, punk, and a bunch of their old influences put in here. Even you elitists will be biting your tongues at this one. And maybe you'll want to get "Five Smokin' Tracks", although that's only really worthy for the remake of "Stain". The other four are demos of what have since appeared on this album. Not as "Sun"-ny as you might expect but it is very good.

While they have a third album, "Little by Little" that comes out next month, I decided I'd discuss about the roots of Harvey Danger. This album brings me memories of when I was a lot younger, because I remember one of the first songs I really was enjoying after I followed music was "Flagpole Sitta". I kind of laughed at the line "I wanna pierce my tongue/it doesn't hurt it feels fine". Now when I look back at that line I think it's a classic shot at satire.Satirical they were. Released on an independent label but then re-issued to Slash/London a year later, the debut album from Harvey Danger is not actually perfect but it shows the band in the right place. They have talent and write good songs. While some fans say that the above-mentioned song is the worst on the album, I personally think that it's just because they got burned out on it. A good song is always a good song, no matter how much it is consumed.The song you'll REALLY be listening to, though, is "Problems and Bigger Ones". This has Harvey Danger with a lot of depth and the bridge is just a really lovely part of the song. Lines like "from damage to damn control" and "we have problems yet and will have bigger ones" are reason enough to buy this album. It's the centerpiece of this album.Other highlights include the long yet catchy "Jack the Lion", "Radio Silence" (also great lyrics) the other ones are good but nothing really special. The lyrics actually outdo the music here.I'm not really a big fan of "Carlotta Valdez", the song just seems, well, incomplete or something. It never did anything for me. So then after awhile I finally decided I wasn't interested in getting into that one. It's not terrible though. But I prefer the other tracks.I'm elated now as well as they were on "Wooly Muffler", which is an example of GOOD hypocrisy: "if you've got greatness in you/would you do us all a favor/and keep it to yourself?". That doesn't happen on Harvey Danger's albums. I much prefer the follow-up album "King James Version". This shows the band at the right place as I said earlier, but that album has diversity and is even more clever than the predecessor. It makes this look forgettable.

It seems like there's two kinds of Hot Hot Heat fans: Those who think the stuff with the original lead singer and the guitarless band was the only great stuff and everything else was a sellout, and others who thought that this was garbage recorded in a dumpster because the quality wasn't up to snuff with later Hot Hot Heat stuff. Consider me neither of those. I think all of their stuff is pretty good, even if arguably this is a different Heat than you know now.This was not put in order of the release, but it's put in a sequence that makes it easiest for people's ears. It includes their two EP's and the split one with Red Light Sting. Tracks 9-12 are all the first EP, although in a somewhat jumbled order. Poor recording quality, although it shows that Hot Hot Heat were even trend-setters in 2000, when the debut EP was released. All of those have a sense of melody. Even on here it shows that Steve Bays was great just as a keyboardist, and I really like the rhythms of the drums as well. Even if it is not for everybody, if "Breakdown" had you dancing, the material here will too. The tracks with yelling are somewhat less digestable since there's no real guitar for some, but I feel like this was kind of an inventive sound. This is noisy punk without guitars and in celebration of the keyboard, with good musicianship. The first two EP's were released on the record label which has Death from Above 1979's current output, Ache, which makes perfect sense. But what Heat did is always the most fun. The potential shown here is really interesting. Matt Mardik didn't really make the band drastically different, as his voice also had a nasal edge at times.In the end, even if you hate it, a band called VCR owes this Hot Hot Heat incarnation a thankyou note. It's got the wit of "Breakdown" and "Knock" as well as more energy than the other records combined -- a bold statement coming from as big a HHH fan as me.

The Hives, while having a moderate success in the U.S., are not really known for the first album and only recently got to find out on the "Your New Favorite Band" compilation. Actually, I don't own that one. Because roughly seven months before that was released I was lucky to find this at a mall and in spite being an import it was not really a bad price at all. I wanted to know the roots of the Hives.Well, basically an even rougher version of what would come later. I enjoy that there's an instrumental in "Stomp" even if that's somewhat like a reprise of the track before it. However, the rest of the album isn't that much different from your typical garage punk. However, that doesn't mean the tracks aren't fun from time to time. Although I don't know if I could listen to this as often as I do their other two, because it's just not as consistent. That doesn't mean that they couldn't arrange songs well at the time though; they could. But it all depends on how much you'd want to buy this. I do not recommend it to the casual fan but if you love them and want to hear the beginning then by all means go for it.

You know, I don't always have to really be a huge fan of an artist to agree with them. For instance, Lars Ulrich said that this is "one of the greatest debut albums [he's] heard in a long time". In spite that I'm a fairweather Metallica fan and I don't care for his ego, I must say that is almost what I think. But I'd modify that: This is the greatest debut album I've heard from ANY artist. And this also happens to be my favorite artist of all-time and there's so many reason why. It gets compared to NIN because that's the closest thing in the mainstream that people can compare it to, even though it sounds nothing like that. It kind of reminds me of what Trent did a year later though on "The Fragile", considering the classical influence on that album that is somewhat evident here. While Jon Crosby uses samples, they aren't those that are relied on, they are just really added elements to the song. Also, the music here is a good combination of acoustic and electric guitar and the electronics give it a great feeling. There are really just way too many things to say about "Visual Audio Sensory Theater".You may have not heard VAST directly, but I'm sure that if you've watched the TV series "Angel" that you have. Four songs from this album were used for that show. While I never watched much of it, it did give me interest.It all starts out with the orchestration of the first track, "Here", which goes out with muffled strings in its guitar refrain. I love Jon's voice and he sounds young yet sophisticated in the verses. It is a great song to introduce someone to this artist of, by the way.The most popular song on this album is definitely "Touched". The sample of "Pilentze-Pe" or whatever it is called makes it really earthly, a quality that makes VAST so great. The track uses acoustic guitar in the intro and first verse. Jon's voice is really great on this particular song and the bridge makes the song as well.It's certainly a lot easier to get into than some other songs on the album. For instance, while there is a lot of passion in Jon's vocals, "Dirty Hole" may turn off some people in first listen, as sometimes it gets overpowering for people. But I absolutely love the organs on this song and the melody is great. It's a great song that is also nice to listen to when angry or something.Then dark synths come in on the electronic "Pretty When You Cry". The first single from the album, it had an interesting video for it and is quite clever although at the same time a bit disturbing. It's probably my least favorite song on the record but mostly because it doesn't fit with the album's context as well as the others.Then you get to the monk-style chanting in the song personally addressed to Jesus, "I'm Dying". Once again, Jon has a lot of passion in his vocals, on this one especially in the chorus. The atomsphere of the song just really enhances what it is. The outro's got a great classical influence.Then you get into the truly mellow territory with the cello-laden "Flames". A great song to sleep or chill out by and not one of the more overpowering tracks for people. One of just many great songs here.But you haven't even gotten to the greatest part from there on. "Temptation" shows some of Jon's excellent lyrics and also has some of the greatest melodies of the record (saying a lot). Another sample by the same people heard on "Touched". The dark feel to this song is great. I like how it is relatively quiet in verses yet real heavy and dark in the bridge and chorus.You get some Middle-Eastern influence of "Three Doors", which also shows Jon's young vocals (he was 21 at the time by the way) in a great way. I believe it's a spiritual track as are some others here, another track worth repeating. The bridge reminds me of something the Cure would do."The Nile's Edge" continues that earthly feel and kind of builds up as it goes on. Jon's voice proves to be unique here and it is one track on here you will find yourself repeating, leading into somewhat similar territory in "Somewhere Else to Be". More monk chants on this one and a great track that is relatively mellow yet angsty. That leads into the segue/transitional track which uses the same chant and has somewhat similar instrumentation.Then it gets into a more keyboard-based electronic track in "You", another sign that it was a great debut album. Even when Crosby's lyrics are trite like in "Your eyes look like they're from God", it just sounds great, especially when you get into the chorus.Sure, it may take some longer to get into it, but for those who don't like VAST, they are severely missing out. 12 tracks of pure aural bliss that can be described as "orgasmic" in a single word and while the new age and classical influences are harder for some to get into, that's just what the music itself is. There is a definite goth influence as well; I imagine quite a bit of those people would get into this album and many I know do like it. Like Reznor, Crosby also mixes electronic and rock to the tracks and Crosby does things truly unlike anyone else out there. I say it's worth it and you're wasting time if you're reading my review. "Music for People" and "Nude" (my favorite album of all-time) are also exceptional. (But I dedicated my 100th review to this album.)

While some of the more well-known underground groups are known for being relatively throwback and such, the same could not be said for Blackalicious. Their music is innovative, and should set a standard for hip-hop. They are unique and exciting to listen to. Not the entire album appeals to me, but I respect the entire thing. It's an underground album that I think more open-minded listeners should be exposed to and would appreciate. I bought this album because of the song "Chemical Calisthenics," I thought it sounded so cool how they did that with the varied tempos and raps that were precise with those beats. Besides, I found many other tracks to be aural pleasure (hehe). There are plenty of memorable moments on here as well, my other favorite probably being "Paragraph President." The energy here is wonderful and there's also kind of a maturity in here that helps. However, there are a few tracks that while I don't dislike them, they don't really appeal to me. That's the only reason why I gave it a 4 rather than a 5.As for more well-thought out reviews, look elsewhere. I meant to be simple. And want people to know of this product's existance. 98% of people who view hip-hop as low-brow have never heard this album, without a question.

...This album is worthy because of "Nobody Like You". I like KoRn and STP a lot, but that's not why I like it. It's a more melodic tune on the album. It's also interesting. It wasn't played bad either. It's probably my favorite Bizkit song of all-time.Other standouts here include the melodic "Just Like This", which, despite being a bit generic, has the chorus which helps it. "Re-Arranged" is the second-best song here. It has a good pace, and it works. I also really like "No Sex", which features Aaron Lewis. Like "Rearranged", it's got a good pace. It's pretty melodic, also.Aside those four standouts, I'm not so crazy about the rest. "Nookie" has a good tune, but it's overshadowed by it's dumb lyrics. It would make a good instrumental tune, though. This is probably the best bass tune of the album. "N 2 Gether Now" I guess is in the mediocre side, though not my cup of tea. Track 9 has has a good background and is also average.If you like Limp Bizkit, I don't see why you wouldn't like this. This is the proof that I'm not a complete hater. I honestly do think that "Break Stuff" sounds like a joke, but it's not "Hot Dog"....

You want industrial? This 1983 LP from Ministry might disappoint you on that front. It's not even the electro-industrial onTwitchand the early Wax Trax! singles won't hint you too much towards this, save the faux-Aussie accent on "Everyday Is Halloween." That's where the comparison ends. The closest things to what you may want to hear if this is what you're looking for are "Revenge" and "Should Have Known Better." Those are my two favorite songs on the record. The former was a great song that led the way for some goth-pop stuff and the latter is a sign of the industrial band that they'd later become.None of it's really that bad, it just sounds weird. I don't really think they were the best band of the style and I don't think they were probably the worst. Most of it is decent, no more or no less. Of course, if you know the later records and want the more aggressive sound, you'll probably hate this record to death. This is what people who laugh at Depeche Mode think that they're supposed to sound like. And if you do like it and are the type of fan I mentioned, you'll be afraid to admit liking it to your friends. But it's not really embarassing; the way I see, it could have been a lot worse than it was. I mean, Al may not own a copy due to being ashamed, but it wasn't a disaster by any means.If you like a more synth-pop sound from the group, this will be an interesting album to check out. However, with it being out of print, places now want to sell this as a collectible for $25. Eff that! So then I went to Hear Music (one of the few they have here) and burned this disc for a much lower price, and for just as good a quality CD.

Sure, Beatles fans would stone me to death for that one, but DM were influential and popular as well. They influenced many a goth/industrial act as well as popularized electronic music, and it's not just that, the songs are pretty catchy on the whole. The band's albums are ALL good, but they work well as a singles band too. This compilation uses the versions of the songs used as A-sides, so some of the mixes are different than you might remember them. The songs are all re-mastered here, and the treat for casual fans is you get to see the lyrics to ALL of the songs in here in the liner notes. Oh, and look at the price that Amazon's currently selling this at; if that's not a reason you should be getting this already then I don't know what would be.Oh, for the people who are already fans, all that's worth mentioning is that classics like "Stripped," "Strangelove," "Personal Jesus," "Enjoy the Silence," "I Feel You," "It's No Good" and "Home" are here. These songs are more than worth buying "The Singles 86>98," and not only that, this isn't a bad first move for your collection of the band. This was the real creative peak for the band. There is only one new song here, "Only When I Lose Myself" and that one is pretty good. It's a more mellow track from the group and I think it works fine. You could also look for a used copy of the single (or if you prefer, the sixth or so singles box set) where you can hear the Dan the Automator remix, which is possibly better than the track in here."Behind the Wheel," "In Your Room" and "A Question of Time" play in different versions than on the respective albums that they originate. This makes a nice additions for the bigger fans like myself, and young ones like myself who find it hard to get their hands on every last single and box set of the group. You'll listen to this album and it's no coincidence they have an album calledMusic for the Masses. It's rock and only occasionally feels really rock ("I Feel You"), and while it's dark it is never really whiny or overly depressing. There is real emotion to the tracks and this collection, as well as the band selling out the Rose Bowl in Pasedena were things that they used to successfully bite tongues of the classic rock fans. Even the "lower" moments from the group are stuff that most bands wish their finest material could live up to be. "Barrel of a Gun" and "Little 15" are not personal favorites of mine but work fine enough in this collection.Feeling nostalgic? Want to hear a catalog of a really great band's music? Look no further than this compilation and if not you can sell it; many people will probably want it anyhow.

I know many punks and leftists will immediately give a "Not Helpful" vote to this review, but to be honest, I don't really care. What annoys me about NOFX and Fat Mike is that the same thing that would annoy me about a punk purist: It's all about "being punk", even if it includes things that are real hypocrisy. For example, "Medio-core", about how mainstream music is boring and unimaginative. They may always stick to being punks and never went on a major label, but really, they don't sound that far from the pop-punk that the purists despise. It seems like this was a reminder to show people that they were into politics, and there was even punkvoter.com made for the people. Unfortunately, I don't always know if I could buy the punk politics and it is not a fun album to listen to at all. "The Idiots Are Taking Over" could've really been written by anyone and is awful, possibly the worst of these songs. Also annoying is the way they try to shout out on how they're punk on the album. To any outsider, it's like they're trying to convince people. Not quite as bad as Anti-Flag, but not much better, either...

EDIT: Okay, after being informed that this is what they released to END their record contract, I can say it's a lousy move at that. But then again, some artists release awful albums in an attempt of this. A Perfect Circle had at least a relevant purpose forEmotive, even though that was a badMer de Noms. Lou Reed made an actual challenging album in the infamousMetal Machine Music. NIN actually did one by making good music. Atreyu? They actually DID sell out for their move! Hopefully this goes out of print, because the band should at least realize in a few years how worthless this collection is.The band decided to leave the record label, probably a good decision of the band anyway, they feel the need to do this. They already had a re-release ofThe Curse, and this is even worse. I'm so glad they didn't do this to Thursday when they signed to Island. Don't let the record label fool you in to buying these marketing ploys.

To be honest, while I did enjoy "The College Dropout", I never fully sinked in to that one because it was so overhyped and overrated, so it was like it didn't give a listener like me the time for things like that. Also, I didn't really think it was perfect although Kanye has broken some new ground in his work, I'll admit that much. Still, as I heard "Diamonds from Sierra Leone", I was so impressed that I decided that I'd go and get this as soon as possible. Then, upon hearing from others that it wasn't the best song on the record, I was rather shocked.This time around, even the tracks with guests don't really bury Kanye from it much at all. There are still quite a bit of skits, something that others may think is a bit of an excess. But even with that, the actual songs themselves are amazing. "Heard 'Em Say" is a good example of how wonderful the thing is in production and Adam Levine sounds great here (on a side note, it seems like he's appearing on a lot of hip-hop albums. Not as surprising as on a Ying Yang Twins record, but still...). The flow is nice as well, and I think that others probably can tell you about it better than I can. But I'm making an attempt anyway.None of the songs here are bad at all. You've probably heard the singles already, both of which are hot, and then there's a lot of other great songs. I love the somewhat jazzy instrumentation in "Drive Slow" as well as the message in it. "Roses" is an example of a guestless song that is done right. The guests here are generally pretty good. Time lengths are varied, but I kind of think that's what makes listening to this quite a bit of fun. I think people will remember this every bit as much as "The College Dropout", although I admit it's a bit soon to tell. But, for what it's worth, it went above all of my expectations. Kanye hasn't fallen at all; I'd even argue that he's rising even more here.I don't always think so, but this is one of those rare cases where the album sales reflect the quality of the record. I don't think you'd have to read my lame review to know that.

And that's not my sole audience, but for everyone looking on this page. DEP are not a band that's for everyone. Not even on the first listen. Also, there are idiots who are calling it mainstream and touting how radio's playing it, but the only time I ever heard them played was on college radio, on a hardcore-type program. It's also ironic that people are saying that it's a parody of old-school DEP. They are obviously just mad that OTHER people like it. I wasn't a DEP fan at first. My first exposure to them was "Baby's First Coffin" from the "Underworld" soundtrack. I'll admit it: The screaming turned me off. After a few listens though, I allowed myself to hear the whole thing and was amazed at how much I enjoyed it.It all starts out with the catchy number "Panasonic Youth" which shows that there is GENIOUS skill from Benjamin Weinman and that the song just is everything a hardcore song should be. It is quick and to the point. Greg Puciato has an amazing range and is not one-dimensional. But I guess the people who heard them pre-Puciato are purists who won't accept that this is a different record and they have the same person writing the music as before. Then comes in "Sunshine the Werewolf" which has an amazing song structure. The first song is just hardcore but this is CHAOS. It has a memorable chorus, but after that it gets more hectic and the last minute is the absolute most enjoyable thing. Then comes in the most accessible moment "Highway Robbery", which has a great, calm guitar solo which some may scream sellout from reading. It's not so much calm as it is clean. It's a straightforward punk song more than anything else, although one with jazz-style drums.Then you finally get a moment where Puciato basically screams throughout on "Van Damsel", with one of the coolest outros I've heard as well as the fact that it's pretty agressive. It then gets to a techno/ambient sound on the intro of "Phone Home", a song that truly builds up to a climax. At first the vocals are almost a whisper and the song has the coolest chords on it. Each verse picks up and Puciato's vocals get louder. This track is just wonderful and shows you that DEP are just as good at other styles as they are with hardcore. Then it gets into "We Are the Storm" which is both the least and most melodic song here. It's kind of confusing to think of it that way, but the second minute shows Puciato at the most melodic moments in midst of the typical hardcore/precision sound. It starts and ends the same on the lyrics but is just fine. Then there's that weird intro that's the sound of machines or whatever. That's where it leads into "Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants" which is probably the most user-friendly thing on this album. Not one of the better moments but worth repeat listens. Then there's the amazing "Baby's First Coffin" which shows each side of the band perfectly. It once again has a dark sound and a nice and more quiet breakdown but is just as great as any other DEP song.I will say that "Unretrofied" is probably one of my favorite moments on this album. It's got a great ambience on the intro and outro and has a cool chord progression once again. The vocals are a little bit distorted in the verses and bridge, but that's fine. It shows a nice electronic side and does it successfully. Only purists would not like this. Then there's "The Perfect Design" which takes things in classic fashion of the album, a straightforward yet complex hardcore song.I honestly can't compare it to older works because I didn't hear anything on those. This version of "Miss Machine" contains an additional DVD that while nothing special is fine for someone new to the band like me who can hear what older songs from "Calculating Infinity" and "Irony is a Dead Scene" are more likely to sound like. The audio is kinda shoddy but otherwise it's done well. It also has the making of which shows some of the guitar/drum/vocal work from the album. There is some new players to the lineup but is done just fine. They also kept Liam as their bassist and Brian Benoit as their other guitarist from the last time, in addition to the two geniouses.In short, if you like an album to be brilliant and precise, buy it. If you want to be pretentious and whine about it, then so be it. But it's definitely not the loss of a listener like me. And I have been known to do SOME negative reviews here. (view my profile)

I usually try to decline doing reviews for albums that I haven't heard 100% of (which is generally unfair), but something needs to be pointed out. Okay, I think it's great that they can be on a major label and still be able to sell as many copies as they do. I also, however, HATE the idea of re-releasing an album which betrays fans of the original copies. Maybe they were running out of pressings at Victory, but otherwise, I'd also like to mention that...My friend who told me that Hot Hot Heat were too mainstream for him also listens to a lot of bands like this. This sounds Taking Back Sunday and Thursday based on the tracks that I've actually heard, and on top of that, they weren't even good before having success. (I'm not one of those people who thinks "success=sellout", either.) I actually even like Thursday, but you're also using the same kind of metaphors as your predecessors. I listen to some screamo, but here's a place where it is used in excess. This band lacks the individuality that bands like the Smashing Pumpkins and Fugazi had, or, more recently, stuff like QOTSA and SOAD (not indie label bands, but bands who aren't parts of trends).. You don't have to like it but I can tell you it's more easy to get into for that reason.Oh, and to the person who called me an idiot, I listen to the Dillinger Escape Plan but you missed my point completely. I meant that those artists were more than a sterotypical band of their sorts by listening to their records, have real ambition in them (yes, all), and the lyrics are also not your cut-and-paste from the style they are unfairly lumped in. Read my review of "Mezmerize" for that so we can talk about Hawthorne Heights... Also, my review for "Siamese Dream", "MCIS", and "Adore" by the Pumpkins (I have one for "Miss Machine", by the way). BTW, why would someone listen to HH if they could listen to a band with far more technical skill and one who released the DVD thing on the same day as the regular version?And since I had to go and make it less on-topic, let me backfire by saying that this thing adds seven tracks and a DVD, things that they could have put on a limited-edition of an upcoming album or something. This marketing strategy is unfair and shows that Victory is the same way as most major labels in marketing. As I said before, the music is very un-special. The members are of very average talent, and unless they stop playing by the numbers, they will die whenever this trend dies. Basically, if they were on a major label, people wouldn't like this band. Instead, they'd be compared to more mainstream bands, in the Good Charlotte way. And I like some unoriginal bands; I'd rather it be more pleasing to my ears, to be polite. There's 12 other reviewers you have the right to attack as well.Also, I'd like to tell you that there are better screamo albums out there. Buy Finch's "What It Is to Burn" or Thursday's "Full Collapse" before this. However, if you like the style so much that you wouldn't mind 3892174 bands carbon-copying it, I highly recommend this album to you. I don't know about anyone else but I couldn't possibly be more burned out on this type of music than I already am. And I thought post-"Bends"-era Radiohead bands and post-grunge bands were in excess before this..**updated**

The Green Album, Weezer's third album, came out five years after the dark emo of "Pinkerton", and as a result, people were disappointed when they came back and had another Ric Ocasek-produced album and a sort of pop-punk sound. Also, that it was only 28 minutes and it was after all those years. Or maybe even that this time around that Matt Sharp wasn't the bassist anymore, replaced by Mikey Welsh. But what Weezer prove on these songs is that quality is above quantity. Especially whenever all of these songs are pretty good.It also isn't really completely like the Blue Album, either. That one had a Pixies/Pavement sound in it, with a little bit of new wave influence and the goofiness of both. This one is more to the point, something that Rivers Cuomo's always been really good at as a songwriter. Songs like "Photograph" and "Island in the Sun" are some of the most memorable =W= songs, the latter with one of their greatest melodies. The latter is a good mix of the clean and distorted sound of guitar.It kind of goes in the power-ballad territory with "Smile", which isn't really one of my favorites here. Perhaps it's because I feel it sort of sounds like a matchbox twenty song with Rivers singing over it. But then there's songs like "Glorious Day" and "Simple Pages" which also change the pace somewhat. "Pages" close to a rap rock song, but it's also interesting even if a bit repetitive. Don't worry, it still sounds more Weezer than anything else. Also, this makes it seem sunnier than "Pinkerton" in some ways. While not maybe on par with that album, I still like this almost as much maybe.If you like simple tracks with hook and melody than I think that you will enjoy this Weezer record.

With the rock these days being so predictable, it's nice to hear a band who is willing to be as adventurous as QOTSA. They first caught my attention with &quot;Lost Art of Keeping A Secret&quot; from the last album, which to this day, I am interested in getting. This album I heard on a rock station once and never got enough of it afterward. The first three songs are the classics, though. Even my mom likes those. Also, screaming has never been very infectious on my ears, but that mold has been broken with &quot;Six Shooter&quot;, an awesome, chaotic track which you must listen to when you're angry.Also, &quot;God Is In the Radio&quot; has awesome guitar lines, as well as the interesting &quot;The Sky Is Fallin'&quot;, and ESPECIALLY the weirdest of all, &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;.Because of these things, I'd say it's this year's best album, with the only possible exception being that Wilco album. To me, they tie and are great for different reasons. If you want to have fun listening to an album, buy Songs for the Deaf.

In spite a bigger production than before and distribution to Warner Bros., "Indestructible" is very much a Rancid record. And pretty much every sound you enjoyed from them is on here. It's not even that bad a starting point from the band. It wasn't intentional, but this was my first full album from the band (found this one at a local library). I enjoyed the variety of the tracks and the band's energy and execution through the record. There is even a few songs that show a more mature side of the group that wasn't even so much present on the predecessors.How you enjoy the record will depend on what type of fan you are. If you were disappointed that LP5 was not enough in the more ska route of "Life," then I think you may find this as a slight redemption. However you slice it though, to say the whole thing's aggressive and/or the whole thing's soft is very much wrong. They do both of these things and more on the record.The record starts (title tracks) and ends ("Otherside") with a bang. The first track in particular is one of their greatest songs ever written and performed. Then elsewhere you get some nice ska on the likes of "Red Hot Moon," hardcore on tracks like the awesome "Out of Control," and you'll be singing along with catchy tracks like "Spirit of '87" and "Born Frustrated," even with the politic-themed lyrics in both. The pop-rock tracks in "Start Now" and "Arrested in Shanghai" are something I hadn't heard before in Rancid, even after going through their back catalog. It adds a nice melodic side to them and is not totally edgeless, either.Admittedly, there are a few tracks that they could've done without on the record, even if none were terrible. But they are sub-par tracks nonetheless. "Memphis" sounds just a bit too much like a re-hash "Journey to the End of East Bay" from their "...wolves" album, and I'd rather listen to that album if I were to listen to that song. "Roadblock" does nothing for me and is kind of boring.Some people will argue that this is the band's weakest recording. I don't know about that, they haven't ever made less than a four-star album by my standards, so I guess I'd feel as though I were splitting hairs on that one. I think I like it a bit more than the eponymous debut though. This album has more mmph that that one didn't always have.

What immediately grabbed my attention about this album was when I found out that it was supposed to be a parody title of Norah Jones's "Come Away with Me". And much of the work here is pretty interesting and shows that she's pretty ambitious, especially for an artist who's just started having a two-album set. That being said, it's sometimes hard to handle it the full way. I recommend listening to it in snippets instead. It does have moments ("Sari", "Let's Get Married"), but it's too varied for me (which says A LOT) and some of her messages are a little bit too much for me. If you put those points aside, it's a nice enough little album though. I totally admire the album and it's not bad, but it's also not one of my favorites.

Of the L.A. scene, I think the Germs just may be one of the greatest bands of their time. Maybe because I'm also not educated enough to know whether or not I'm actually right. But I can tell you that I do love the Germs. For one thing, I like the style in which Pat Smear plays guitar. He is what makes some of the songs what they are. Like in "Richie Dagger's Crime", possibly my favorite song on here, it works really well.Some of the recordings on here are really shoddy. Take for instance the live performance of "Sexboy" which sounds like it might have been recorded from the audience even. Actually, most rather than some and that's the most standoutish of that.Most of these songs are pretty enjoyable. Although I don't really like the drums, I find myself entertained by "Shut Down (Annihilation Man)", in spite of its nine-and-a-half minute length (and they did this 25 years before Green Day did it). The bass is admittedly repetitive, but I guess its flaws that also make it interesting, with humanlike quality. I like the random spiels of the track as well. Then there's tons of others that are lots of fun and great lyrically like "We Must Bleed". Most of it I'd say is pretty good, even if not perfect. I'm not punk but I can tell you that I enjoyed this.Another standout is the booklet. It's nice to learn about the band as well as getting to hear some of their music. There are a couple of articles on the Germs and it only adds on to the legacy.I also like the way how the early punk bands put most of their recorded output into a single disc so that we wouldn't have to spend 3x the cash. Even if that sacrifices my interest in listening to the record in a single setting sometimes. What we get is the full "Forming" single, "Lexicon Devil" single, "G.I." in full, "What We Do Is Secret" b-sides, and more.

I am always hearing critics say that the self-titled album from these guys is "the only album by [VF] that's worth owning". I get the feeling that either this recording fell on deaf ears, they didn't really listen to this, or something along the lines of trying to sound cool. But really this is the best possible way to follow up the timeless debut, and the music here is equally as well-aged. Originally, Brian Ritchie did not want to be involved with Gordon Gano's Christian songs, so the first album had none, and this one has it. Seen as a parody at first, but that's completely understandable. After all, how do you know it's sincere when put into the rest of the context of "Black Girls"? (Speaks in a real un-PC manner). However, I feel that it is one of the greatest tracks on "Hallowed Ground", a change in pace from others here and even the debut, with more of a jazz influence than before.That's another great thing about this album: The guys step outside of their folk-punk shell on this album. We get a well-done country song about a murder via drowning ("Country Death Song"), some more of Ritchie's xylophone playing ("I Hear the Rain"), as well as other really great moments. The album is far matured from the debut. While that one made me feel great about my youth, "Hallowed Ground" reminds me of just life in general and the things that go on in it. Oh, it's title track is yet another masterpiece in this somewhat short album (9 tracks total, but you get all quality).Who knew a country-jazz-Appalachian Folk-etc. type album could have balance and not seem like a gimmick! And even if you don't like it the first time, I think it will grow on you if you give it time. You do not have to be religious to appreciate the imagery in here.

Although I don't recommend this to you if you don't like "Starf***ers, Inc" or remixes in general, this is pretty good anyway. There is quite a bit of it that is throwaway, but I'd take this any day over an album of no new songs and all ripoffs.Not brilliant like 'Fixed' or as well-done electronica as 'Further Down the Spiral', this is good on its own right. It doesn't leave all the singles behind, as there's "Slipping Away", a nice variation on "Into the Void" from 'The Fragile'. You also get nice strings-for-piano tracks like the one for "The Frail".One natural problem is that "The Frail" and "Starf***ers, Inc" are the two worst songs on 'The Fragile', so that's kind of a shame because otherwise it could have been better. And there's THREE remixes of "Starf***ers, Inc." On the other hand, you get to finally hear the only-import-available "10 Miles High", as well as the cool instrumentals in "The Great Collapse", even if dated.To me the real highlight of the whole things is his seven-minute rendition of Gary Numan's "Metal". No flaws in it, with an even cooler last two minutes. This impressed me from the first time that I listened to it and is worth the price of the album alone.

I've always heard from many Radiohead fans about the quality of the B-sides being pretty good, and while I wanted to get a hold of the stuff, most of it was imports so I thought it was a sky high investment, if I were to do it. And I didn't get into Radiohead until a few years after even this compilation. And it's a great compilation, even if a little bit incomplete for some.I really loveOK Computerand was looking forward to the B-side. People who own that album already know the first track, "Airbag," which is Radiohead greatness, and with some excellent Thom Yorke lyrics, guitar effects and playing, and such. It's actually the song that inspired me to buy said album.As for the B-sides, they aren't as good as that album, but I think it's far above average, even for B-sides. I really liked the instrumental "Meeting in the Aisle," as well as the others. The songs here are actually pretty catchy, particularly in "Palo Alto," the last track on the record. It's back in print after a long time. So no longer is it "limited edition" as Amazon.com lists. And at some places it is sold at a very good price; you can get it for roughly eight bucks at your nearest Best Buy.Overall, a casual Radiohead fan may not want this, but if you're into the group already, I recommend it. And in comparison to the actual studio albums, I'd actually put it ahead of the last two LP's, as well as of coursePablo Honey(has moments but is scattershot).Dear Amazon: "OK Computer" is the title of that album, and taking it out of my title makes no sense at all. Also, I apologize for price comparisons, although I'd either be a lot poorer or would own way less music if I never did such a thing.

...And yes, I can proudly say that I was listening to this stuff whenever Pun was still alive and the album was just recently out. Putting everything aside, though, "Capital Punishment" is a nearly flawless album and one of the few great mainstream hip-hop albums of the past ten years. Listening to the album gives me a kind of nostalgia as well, since there was so much great music released back then, and hip-hop was a lot better (DMX's first album, Lauryn's solo album, OutKast's "Aquemini", etc). I remember I really enjoyed hearing "Still Not a Player", a part-remixed, part-new song that had a really catchy tune and awesome flow. A track for anyone who likes a track you can hear at the club, R&B; or hip-hop.Many talk about how someone his size can flow so fast is impressive. However, even if it were someone of any other size it would have been just as good an album. The quality of it is mainly in his delivery and the content of the flows. You'll hear it in "Beware", "Super Lyrical" (with Black Thought; the greatest track on the album), "The Dream Shatterer" and even in "Twinz", a track with Fat Joe that updates the Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg single "Deep Cover." There's also greatness like in the childhood reflection of the title track or the rising of fame in "You Came Up", one of the more catchy tracks in here. Even "Punish Me" is great, a song of a broken relationship, never getting mysogynic or anything like that.Some may not like the many interludes in the album, but I'm totally fine with those. I like the intro and how "Charlie Rock Skit" is basically a brief intro to the next track, "Fast Money." Some are kind of entertaining to hear like the two "Pakinamac" tracks. Sometimes the tracks can be pretty funny though, like in "Uncensored" with Funkmaster Flex.Another shocking quality is that a lot of the "superstar" songs are the more weaker tracks on the album, and for me even more since those were some of my favorite mainstream rappers (Wyclef, Busta).I'd say that if you like any kind of hip-hop that you will most likely enjoy "Capital Punishment", an album that is surprisingly well-aged in time. Pun may have had a short career, but in the time he delivered some of the greatest stuff around.

One thing that's interesting about Beck, other than just him, is the level of ambition he has always had. In the period of 1993-1994, he even released three albums all on different record labels. Of course, being on Geffen, "Mellow Gold" was the one meant to break Beck through.Many people always talk about "Loser", and while that's a good song, I'm honestly very sick of it. That being said, the lyrics are amusing, especially the "get crazy with the cheez whiz" line. There are a few songs that I prefer to listen to and the high points of this album are pretty high. "Motherf--ker" is one of the noisiest and rock-ish songs Beck has made and I find it amusing when his voice raises on the track. It's brilliant. I also really enjoy the final track "Blackhole" which is pretty amazing, really. It's probably my favorite song on the album, with a nice acoustic guitar leading the track, along with its quirky tune. As well as that cool bonus ending of the album that's kinda white noise-ish. "Pay No Mind (Snoozer)" and "Beercan" were singles that didn't get as much recognition but are great in their own right. The latter reminds me of some of what came on later records and is some fun.There are a couple of tracks I don't particularly care for. I found "Truckdrivin' Neighbors Downstairs (Yellow Sweat)" to be rather annoying and I felt that a track like "Steal My Body Home" was kind of failed in its execution. I like sitar in lots of songs, but it just doesn't quite fit in here.Like many Beck albums, this one tends to be highly regarded. While a great album, I tend to preferOdelayandMutations. People who don't like something offensive are better off starting elsewhere and people who like a song-structured album are better advised going withSea ChangeandGuero. It'll take little while for this to sink in for some, but for most part it is worth it.

Probably one of the most hyped indie albums of the decade, while the Strokes don't look like they made quite the impact critics believed they would five years ago, it did help them become the ultimate hipsters for awhile. And these 11 songs aren't really profound, deep, or anything like that. Lyrically, it reminds me of the obscurity of old R.E.M., and while I don't enjoy every song on here, there is definite highlights. You'll be repeating "Barely Legal" and "Hard to Explain" the most, since those two are where they get the formula right. The other songs are good, too, but those are the more instantly memorable ones. I also like the sequel "Room on Fire", although I'm kind of mixed on the new one. Seems like it's one of those times where the band was better using the formula.

While she was known for the whole Kabbalah thing for awhile, it is more full-bloomed on her latest album, "American Life", than anything else. Those who cannot stand that kind of message may be turned off from the album, and I could totally understand why someone would hate this album, but personally I don't mind. Heck, I don't even agree with her spiritually! I will agree that it is not her best. Neither was "Music". That one was okay but a disappointing direction after the magnificent "Ray of Light" which I still think is her best studio album. It was a great mix of electronica and showed everything done with a good balance on the album."American Life", if you can swallow her messages, is okay. The lyrics didn't really insult my intellegence. In fact, there are some points that I really do like. I like the title track quite a bit, a stab at how media has a lot to expect out of people. The rap is something that turns people off but personally I don't find it that embarassing. It's kind of fun, actually. Then, while not a great song, "Hollywood" is still kind of an enjoyable song, yet another song about how the media is. It's not really one that you'll be playing over and over again but it's decent. "Love Profusion" is easily the greatest blend of folk and techno. Personally I wouldn't mind if she kept on playing guitar on her albums. I think it shows an honest side of her growth even if it's not a message that everyone can swallow. It is one that I tend to repeat quite often. Also there is by far my favorite moment here, "Die Another Day", which is classic Madonna. It's the closest to electro-clash her songs have gotten and shows some new ground broken in Madonna's songs. These four songs are the "better" from "American Life"There of course is a lot of problems with "Life". For instance, I can't get over how much vocoder is used on some of these songs, notably "Nobody Knows Me". The message is a bit pretentious and I realize she wanted to make it personally but that effect is hard for me to stomach for a whole song. The choir and stuff on "Nothing Fails" is just kind of awkward for me; I don't know what it is really. Then there is "Mother and Father" which you don't want to listen to if you did not like "American Life"'s rap, because this one has more of it and is worse. Either way, there are many things not to like about "Life" and I thought I'd warn that to those who may not like the message.The rest is in between. Not her greatest moment at all, but I think she does have some relevance even after this record. I kind of am interested in what's next even though it may not be perfect. But hey, maybe it won't be on too many albums that she does this. Besides she had a lot of really worthy output in the previous years. If you're fine with everything Madonna's doing and like what you're expecting than I say go ahead and buy it anyway, but this one with precautions.

Before you see my 3-star review, I will put one thing straight: I love Tool. They are one of my favorite bands and "Lateralus" is one of my top ten favorite albums of all-time. I love "nima" and "Undertow" as well. I don't even think that "Opiate" is a bad album, HOWEVER, one thing I will say is this:This isn't terribly different from what a lot of the early '90's alt-metal artists were doing. Helmet and Prong churned out stuff like this for about as long and the results were more impressive. Helmet's lyrics were less juvenile than those on "Opiate." But that's one thing that makes this an interesting listen. It shows that they were not always a band that was about complexity and being big. I do prefer the more "pretentious" sides of Tool, though.The band doesn't really hide their meanings under any of the messages. It doesn't require thinking about what the songs are about since they are all so straight-forward in the lyrics. Sometimes you just have to look at the titles, even, to know the meaning. 2 of the tracks are live, but it works since the production is so raw. In some points, I enjoy it and find it entertaining. The censorship message of "Hush" is against the idea of sugar-coating and other moments on it are noteworthy. Some of it is not really that interesting, and while it's probably the best musically, "Opiate" is just ridiculous in the lyrics. I see that it's anti-religion and such, but this shows how juvenile the lyrics in Tool were. I mean, even on a track like "Eulogy," Maynard was much more "deep" in content.Overall, "Opiate" is not for the faint of heart and rough around the edges, but if you love Tool you may find something out of this.

I guess I could understand why some people would like this. The tracks don't have a big meaning, so it doesn't wind up taking itself too seriously (which is a contrast to modern AFI). There isn't much artistic merit, as it's run-of-the-mill skate punk. And the "Resevoir Dogs" sampling is pretty cool, actually.That being said, I don't really care for this CD. The songs don't have a whole lot of variety and doesn't have good playback value. Juvenile songs can be charming and amusing, but on here, it just makes me kind of yawn and roll my eyes at times. It's refreshing to hear a band who used to be something completely different, though, and this was literally only 1/2 of today's lineup. While it's interesting that Davey's got less of a high-pitched voice here, that actually made him a bit more distinguished, and it's hard for me to call what's on this album that. I like a few of the songs, but could have done without most of it. I think that omitting two of the songs from the CD version really worked in the audience's favor, as it wears its welcome out about halfway though.Me, I don't like the first two CD's that much. It's all uphill from there. Especially starting in theBlack Sails in the Sunsetera. Punk purists (those who deem major label stuff as "sellout") will recommend you this in favor of the last two, but really I think those are awesome. But then again, you'd have to appreciate some goth & dark pop to really "get" that one.

Well, that can be both good and not-so-good. "Nimrod." is a respectable evolution in Green Day's discography, and also the one where they seemingly threw out a bunch of ideas and put them into record. Most people who have hated them mainly do because of their popularity. It is actually not my favorite Green Day album at all, but that doesn't mean that I don't recommend it. I just tend to think that the group has more cohesive efforts than this one. It does have its highlights, though -- lead single "Hitchin' a Ride" shows a new direction and (at the time) a pretty surpring intro for a Green Day song. Actually, it was my first Green Day record, which I got because I liked "Redundant" so much (I was aware of some older stuff, but I was also very young at the time). The album's kind of short for having the amount of tracks it does, and unfortunately, there are songs that stand out above others. None of it's terrible, but just forgettable and try-too-hard at worst. Give it a try.

Which you can hear on this album. You know those albums where just about every song is basically "just there"? This is one of them. I mean, I don't fail to see Lit's merit at all. In fact, it's one of my all-time favorite artists. However, producer Don Gilmore turned this album into a milquetoast nothing type thing. The lyrics are still just as clever as they've ever been and Jeremy Popoff has some good riffage. What's lacking in this is songs with real mmmph. I can't get over how hollow the production is and there's only a handful of songs worth listening to. Those songs aren't even great. I like "The Last Time Again", which is fine; "Happy in the Meantime" shows they can make a good ballad and "Slip" is the only remotely interesting thing. "Over My Head" is decent and has backing vocals from Aersomith's Steven Tyler.This album is so lackluster and it's a shame to admit. At one point, Lit was my favorite band; I basically liked everything they did. Here, they sound milquetoast and mainly it's because the producer made it sound even more bland this time around. He also produces for Linkin Park, by the way.Seriously, you only need this if you want everything done by Lit. Buy Lit, A Place in the Sun, and Tripping the Light Fantastic. Those are actually really good albums.

..It is considered one of the greatest '90s albums for a good reason, even if it was hyped out of proportion. It didn't "start" alternative, it just brought it closer to the masses. For someone like me, that's just a great thing. Putting history aside, here's a few misconceptions from naysayers:"Nirvana's music only appeals to suicidal and/or emo kids" --> I know plenty of people who listen to Nirvana who love their lives, myself included, and although I used to hate it, my liking of this album had nothing to do with that. "Nevermind" isn't even that gloomy. If I read this review, I'd think it were a review for a goth band or something. This isn't the Sisters of Mercy. There's humor on "Nevermind", which shows that Cobain did have some high points, whether you loved it or hated it."I blame them for inspiring (insert inferior band)" --> Nice shot, but every band who makes it in the mainstream is bound to influence some people who don't have a clue or talent with their music. You may not like it for this reason but it's not that valid to why these guys "aren't that good.""The guitar playing isn't very good"--> Well, it looks like you just need to open your mind: It's YOUR problem. Just because they aren't being complex doesn't mean anything. Listen to prog-rock bands for that; fans of it annoy me to begin with. Nirvana's inspired by PUNK, which is meant to be simple, and these songs have hooks and edge in them, which makes "Nevermind" so great."it's overproduced garbage, the other two albums are REAL Nirvana" --> Sure, Cobain may have claimed to be ashamed of the production. But if you like albums such as "Grace" by Jeff Buckley which were also mixed by Andy Wallace, you suffer from HYPOCRISY. This actually brings a diversity to the band's music, where the other albums would've sounded a bit more same-y if done otherwise. I like how it's got that crystal-clear shining through, although it's probably not what Cobain wanted the album to be. It was really well recorded and that's why "Smells Like Teen Spirit" still sounds wonderful in the context of this album."it isn't metal!!!" --> Yeah, and what does it matter. Lots of Nirvana fans don't like metal anyway.I won't argue that it's highly regarded, but some of the people on this site are just being ridiculous. I also don't like how some people ignorantly judge the audience and THEN whine about how others judge them. Look at yourselves. This was influenced by the loud/soft dynamics of the Pixies, although it's not quite as quirky and a bit more pop-based. "Nevermind" is an album that is worth owning, even if people have blown its praises out of proportion. Either way, I think an even better choice would be "MTV Unplugged in New York". "In Utero" is great as well and is on roughly the same level as the album. However, the songs here seem more developed and "complete" which is why I tend to enjoy it slightly more.

Like others have mentioned this is a movie you will either love or hate. In fact, everyone I know in person has an opinion to those extremes. I find myself in the former, because this movie is easily summed up in one word: Random. Yes, random... I wonder how it was thought up but I find it rather brilliant. So what if MTV Films was a part of this, it's a great movie. I even find people hating this movie quoting it, which is something that is pretty interesting.If you're looking for a meaningful movie though, you'll be dissapointed. There is like no real point to the movie, although I find that to be part of what's so great. The title character doesn't reveal it, but he's quite skillful: Good artist, dancer, and used it as part of the support to vote for Pedro, someone he had met from his school when he had first came to the school. A part of this movie involved with Napoleon & Pedro is in my title of this review.He lives with two people: his computer-loving cousin who is almost thirty and his total jerk uncle. The former character falls in love with a woman, Lafawnda, and the latter tried giving friend Deb some shampoo, which dissapoints her, although they do end up doing a dance together for the prom.He busts his moves more than anything for the class president thing, which resulted in Pedro's victory. It is part of what's really cool, I thought, along with a speech saying that "all of your wildest dreams will come true". I mean, who wouldn't vote for that.The greatest thing though about this movie is that it's like a home-made video in many ways, although the whole thing is completely acted. This low-budgetness kind of makes it the great movie it is as it has little to do with its visuals but with its storyline/plot. It is worth seeing multiple times.

..and to tell you the truth, those things don't really usually catch my attention, unless I like the artist a lot. Yet, at the same time, I remember hearing "Stardust" and "Tiny Girl" at the time this was released and thoroughly enjoyed both songs. Some people may be disappointed that it's all covers, but if that weren't the case, they may as well have called it a Depeche Mode album. And in my humble opinion, Dave Gahan's are what completes the group. There are plenty of Gore-sung tracks I love though (especially the two from "Ultra").My favorites are the covers of "Loverman" (by Nick Cave) and "I Cast a Lonesome Shadow." I haven't heard the first "Counterfeit" EP, but I like what I've heard from it. Also, this was recorded shortly after "Exciter," so naturally, the songs here have that kind of feel. I think it's great; I even sort of love it. True, it may not have a lot of range, but range is overrated. It should only be used if the artist is going to get it right, which unfortunately isn't always the case.

I actually came across this album a couple years ago, but at the time I only really payed attention to the big hit, "And She Was." Then I checked it out again, and realized that each of these songs is catchy and solid. Sure, it's not as quirky or goofy as moments in older releases, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have greatness. It does. The album especially has a good album-ending punch with "Television Man" and "Road to Nowhere." "Road" was actually pretty unconventional compared to the remainder of the album even though it was one of the hits from the album. And yes, David Byrne sings more mid-range here. He actually does sound British at points, like in the chorus of "Creatures of Love." Quirky lyrics like "I've seen sex and I think it's okay" and "I wanna make him stay up all night" make the album memorable. It may not be an elitist favorite but it still connects to younger people, including me, a fan who isn't even 20 yet.

You know, I once saw someone say that this shouldn't be considered music, and in one way, that person is right: it's an aural explosion on record, in a way not even an industrial band could execute it. This record came out at a time I was still coloring walls, but even I could connect well with it, it is that good. The record hasn't aged a bit. The first I heard from P.E. was "Fear of a Black Planet" a few years back, and I really enjoyed that one. I got to this and was shocked at how it was EVEN better.Chuck D. and Flavor Flav have a delivery that can't be missed, and the Bomb Squad use some awesome loops and samples. The 3 or 4 interludes on here are great too, and not even those come off as filler. The lyrics are intellectual social/political message. There's not much quite like this today, in fact that might even be an understatement. Some tracks come off like siren tracks, like listening to songs like "Night of the Living Baseheads" and such. The live samples add to the energy of this record. It is a hip-hop record, but you don't have to be a fan of the genre to enjoy this. The energy could be appreciated by a rock fan, and the instrumental of a track like "Black Steel..." could be appreciated by a jazz fan maybe. It doesn't need to be limited to genres. It's a great record, period. The influence is something that's even been going on through the times, and that doesn't need to be explained or even justified.It's cheaply priced and an amazing album, even sounding fresh nearly 20 years. It doesn't even need remastering any time soon! That's all the more impressive. There is so little not to like about this record, it is recommended to everyone from me.

Before I get into the review, I must say one thing: I'm sick of people dismissing the album because they find it "pretentious." It seems people today only use the term to sound like they have a better vocabulary than they actually do, which would actually fit that word! Not just that, some of the interludes are kind of intermissions to show Tool's experimental side that had greatly grown on here. Sure, it's not for everybody, but can't you at least admit that sometimes you just don't enjoy something because you may not get it? That doesn't make it pretentious.Also, while a couple of interludes do seem ponderous at best, some of the songs are just so good that they make this album five stars. Sure, you know about the five singles maybe, but one track that's EVEN better than those is "Pus--t." 11 minutes long, it shows some of Maynard's most impressive vocals; the melody just catches you in. The song doesn't come off as the least bit overlong. I also like how the intro sounds like it'll be something kind of weird or orchestral, but then you start hearing standard Adam Jones riffs. Of course, the structure of "nema" is just breath-taking, and I find it very interesting. It has some really awesome Danny Carey drums too; there's no one quite like him. "Third Eye" is fourteen minutes long but can be suspenseful, especially when it reaches to its climaxes, descends, then builds back up. Hearing "prying open your third eye" is something that's going to get stuck in your head. Oh, and there's some really amazing melodies on that track as well. Sometimes the lyrics are kind of ambiguous, yet I have my own interpretations (I somehow think "Stinkfist" is about sex). There's some more straightforward stuff here, like the structure of said song and the slow-burning "H." as well as the sell out lyrics on "Hooker." It may seem a bit juvenile for some, but I find the track amazing. Also, some of the interludes are kind of interesting and mildly funny, like the cool futuristic organs on "Intermission" and the German-spoken recipe on "Die Eier Vor Satan.""nima" is an astounding album. I actually think they've outdone themselves with "Lateralus" and perhaps I'll even view "10,000 Days" as such, but this record is totally worth owning. If you like alternative metal, or just rock in itself, you owe it to yourself to give this record a chance. "Undertow" is also excellent.Worth the money.

Honestly, I came slow into buying this record. I was not a real big fan of Brand New's first two albums, which were fine for what they were but not my type of thing (read: it bored me) but I knew I was going to eventually come around to this one the more I heard about it. They had indie influences from all the right places on each review I had seen for the album, and some of it was enjoyable. I also later heard they were headlining a tour that had Thrice as an opening act - I'm a die-hard Thrice fan, and because of that I knew I'd rush and get their stuff anyway, even the stuff I didn't remember enjoying a whole lot.Well I still thinkDeja Entenduwas just an album, nothing great or interesting although one with good lyrics and with well put together tracks. "The Devil and God" however, is a GREAT album, at times even AMAZING. It shows a great deal of growth and you can tell the time they took off of the studio and to get these songs around really did pay off.This record is more artistic than commercial but has something to offer to all kinds of listeners. "Millstone" and "The Archers' Bows Have Broken" will appeal to the people who like a dose of something more catchy, and the former has a nice enough chorus and the drums give it a nice effect as well. The riff and chorus of "Archers" makes it a surefire hit and the chorus in particular is awesomely done. Then, on another end of the spectrum, there's totally other different songs. "Handcuffs" is an interesting tune that's done in a pretty down to earth vein, even when the track gets more of a studio-like treatment of the strings and such, with really interesting lyrics.And it's other avenues that totally move me as the listener as well. My favorite song here by far is "Degausser," which puts loud/soft dynamics of a song in a kind of dark, sinister way but also totally will relate to the listener. I like the part with the voices in the first two verses; that really sets the tone for the song. The lyrics on here are just plain awesome as well. At a little over five minutes I sometimes find myself repeating this one. I also really like "Limousine" which follows. It has several parts that later don't get repeated, until the refrain in the last two or so minutes of the song. At one moment the climax is anthemic enough to compare to the likes of My Chemical Romance, even with its acoustics in the majority of the song. And then the track later builds again (after and during refrain part mentioned), ending into an awesome guitar jam part.Then there's other sing along choruses in the record like "Not the Sun" and memorable riffs like in "You Won't Know."The most famous songs are "Sowing Season (Yeah)" and "Jesus," but I think that about half of the other songs are either in competition or are a little bit better than those two. Although the chorus of the former is pretty memorable as well as the bridge and the chords are nice on "Jesus" and I especially like listening to this one a lot. Some of the lyrics are interesting and even though it takes awhile for it to finally build up a little bit more it's a fine enough song, which shows them great at personal tracks as usual. But then again Lacey is one hell of a songwriter.Two of the tracks here work more as interludes than full songs and those are the ones I get the least out of on the record. "Welcome to Bangkok" never really goes anywhere after the spaced intro and then I never really got the point of that untitled one either. Even though I didn't mention it and it's not one of the better songs "Luca" is still a decent song. It reminds me of a mix of Radiohead's "Street Spirit" and some classic rock song that I can't think of at the top of my head.Still, "The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me" is a fantastic record and should be heard by all fans of modern music, and given they have a taste for alternative/indie stuff or even the emo they are associated with. It's a great album in any account. I've had times when I've thought twice but encourage you do otherwise when approaching to the record. I'm wondering what they'll do from here. "(Fork and Knife)" isn't a bad direction, either.

Of all the bands out today, I'd have to say that one of the most deserving is definitely SOAD. They get lampooned by people for their success or by some because those people don't understand them. Or the political difference. But not even that characteristic is as omnipresent in these songs as you may be convinced. It's more the self-titled sound than one in "Toxicity", and on here, the band prove to make even more great music. None of the material sounds that forced. When they stray from metal, it doesn't seem like they're holding back at all, just being natural. They even use accordions! Those are two of the album's greatest songs: "Radio/Video" and "Old School Hollywood", the latter even beginning in vocoder! That track is like a real standout of the album, in its quirkiness and theme of an all-celeb baseball game.Yeah, there's way more vocals from Daron this time around. Somewhat disappointing to me in that Serj is just an amazing vocalist, but I also really like it when bands have more than one vocalist. It's kind of what gives this half of the double album some character, is the varied instruments heard. "Cigaro" is a nice track with the chorus stacked over the verses, very quirky all thoughout, yet very catchy. "BYOB" shows the insane tempo changes in its politically charged track, from its thrash-inspired guitar intro to its dancy/catchy chorus, to operatic sounds and whatnot. I feel that the political lyrics in "Sad Statue" are a lot more poignant and better. There's also issues like the "Violent Pornography" which are spoken of here. After that, you hear acoustic, Latin-flavored guitar intro in "Question!". It's got a real hypnotic melody and is one of the greatest singles I've heard in awhile. The distortion kind of makes it more addicting. But one thing that makes the album, more than anything is that SOAD really gets the balance right on "Mezmerize". The songs do get real silly sometimes, though, which may be a turn-off, like the nonsensical "This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song". I like it, but it's not really close to my ideal SOAD track, the worst on the disc. But in spite this disc's rather short length, it is rather satisfying in the end. The added elements are there for you to get used to.More proof that people who stereotype them as typical nu-metal either need to clean their ears out or are just flat out snobs.

I enjoy Moby's music a lot. I realize though that many times he'll make turning point albums and basically gets criticised when he does (and ironically, for not doing it enough like on "18"). I'm one of the few who thought "Animal Rights" was actually great and enjoy the other '90s stuff. This one is interesting since he's stripping away the samples and using actual vocals in most of the songs. Then there's that other singer, Laura Dawn, who kind of shares the vocals with the album. Covering New Order was kind of inevitable for Moby, so it makes sense that "Temptation" appears here, although it's really not done as anything special. Which is kind of how I'd sum this thing up. It can satisfy, has its moments ("Lift Me Up" is one of my all-time favorite Moby songs), but ultimately it doesn't do a whole lot. It is really not terrible though like some critics may have you believe. The ambient disc, which is a limited edition thing I believe, is nice to sleep/rest to, as I did today after feeling the need to rest. It's kind of hard to say if I really recommend it or not. I don't know that it's worth a whole lot, but it doesn't really suck and some fans may like this type of thing.

Okay, so I love Nirvana. But even they were not perfect, although some would highly debate that one. The studio albums were all pretty good, two of three amazing ones at that. The bulk of the material on "Incesticide" was left off of the albums for a very good reason: It doesn't live up to what they do as a band on the records. There are some pretty good moments though: While the session version of "Aneurysm" isn't that different from the original (on the "SLTS" single) it is still fairly amusing to hear Kurt sing lines like, "Come on over and do the twist," and there's some nice enough riffs on the track as well. I really enjoy the cover of the Vaselines' "Molly's Lips," a group he highly championed. But one great thing about Kurt getting the success is on top of putting my choice of music on the map, he often would also put many of the underground bands who inspired him on the map. That's one example. Also, there's childhood stuff that's mentioned both more as reflective ("Sliver") and rather humorous ("Been a Son"). I like the sort of change in pace on "(New Wave) Polly," but recommend theNevermindversion tenfold over this.There are quite a few clunkers though. For one the record goes for a lot longer than it needs to as well, and some of the well intentioned stuff is pretty boring. "Beeswax" and "Hairspray Queen" are some of the group's worst songs, neither of redeeming value. I like the concept of "Aero Zeppelin" but not even that one's very memorable. I like Devo quite a bit but the "Turnaround" cover is a real failure. Putting "Downer" which is already onBleachwas a pretty pointless inclusion as well. It's pretty mediocre for them. The first half is a lot better than the second half, if you ask me.Time has not treated this as kindly as other Nirvana releases, and I pretty much recommend anything else over this. But, I recommend it if you want to get more into Nirvana. Just don't expect any real brilliance in this collection, as it's far and few on this release. Also, the actual albums are more dynamic which I by default prefer to this release. It's usually sold cheap and is interesting at least for a few listens.

And I don't really see why. Longtime fans call it their poppiest, and while it's definitely the mellowest, that doesn't mean that it's not noisy or self-indulgent for the mainstream. While the lyrics don't mean all that much, it adds up the eccentricness of the album, making it more fun with each listen. About the only other flaw with this album is that Lee Ranaldo doesn't sing on any tracks on this album."Bull in the Heather" is a classic, as is its video with that Le Tigre girl cameoed in it. Kim has an excellent voice on it, as well as it being loved among the fans. The outro part sounds real cool.Opener "Winner's Blues" is a real nice track, as it's an acoustic-like track, a brilliant track on this album.I just love "In the Mind of the Bourgeois Reader". It's a punk-like track here, probably the fastest one, and Thurston sounds as if he's having a lot of fun during the recording of it. Then it goes into "Sweet Shine" the only song with any real length on the album. It's a great love song.She has some pretty interesting tracks as well. Her style overall has a sexy sound to it. "Bone" is very awesome, I love the energy of the drums on it, then the chords are well-progressed. It's just a real memorable one on this album. She sings 7 of the 14 songs.'Experiental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' is something that really shines on track 12 "Tokyo Eye", a very noisy song. It's very awesome to listen to either in the car or on your stereo.This one's good for introducing people to SY. I got this January of this year, and I think it's excellent. There are some flaws, but overall, I think it's pretty good. The songs are very short, which helps, 'cuz it doesn't really contain enough epic stuff. So yeah, I am recommending it here. Esp. if you don't like the mainstream much and think that this sounds cool, like I do.

Well, this is one of those albums from the band that I actually would consider rather overrated. It's good and all, but the songs are a bit too slow for how I'd like it. And I actually *loved* Zooropa. This album, however, does have its moments."Beautiful Day" is the album's classic track, which you probably have heard. It's enough to make the album worth, as well as "Elevation", "Walk On", and "Kite"... The first two are also singles, the first being a heavier moment on the album, the second being a melodic mid-80s-style U2 track, the latter being a track that shows that they can do good without being pretentious and making an enjoyable song. "Wild Honey" is one of the easier moments to catch to as well.I am not really that fond of "Peace On Earth". That one just never did anything for me, as I dislike that one.Everything else is in between. Probably my least favorite of U2's studio albums. I hope that based on the new single from the new album, they really are getting edgier. It's obvious that with this album, they are back to trying to make a statement, which they had dropped in the 90s.

Yes, you read right. Jon Crosby is an artist who does what he likes the way he likes it. Instead of simply going by what bored fans want him to do, he doesn't mind making a record that has songs that didn't use recording proficiencies. That's what makes Nude so great. But that's only the beginning, seeing as this is an artist who's not yet approached 30 and still has some room for growth. Every single time it makes you wonder what's coming along the way. You get something electronic, acoustic, heavy, chilling, and otherwordly at the same time. This type of music is an acquired taste, but once you get into it you start to be hooked. Just give a listen to the songs and that's reason enough.It took about a month but it's my favorite album now from any artist. I mean, I liked The Fragile by NIN this much, but I think I like Nude *even* more. This album is twelve basically flawless songs. It doesn't follow the same pattern that the previous two albums did and most complainers spent way too much time listening to 'Turquoise' and 'Crimson' which weren't even supposed to be official. Nude is many things: Calm, heavy, coy, conceptual, etc. You can find something to like on this album no matter what you listen to.If you like it heavy and electronic simultaneously, which I do, "Turquoise" is the perfect way to start things off. It's got Jon's most confident and powerful vocals on any VAST album, with one of the greatest choruses. His spiritual imagery is brilliant. There is nothing else like out there. By contrast there's the piano pop of "Don't Take Your Love Away", which also has nice strings that go along with it. It shows that Jon is great when writing music as well as the lyrics. Sometimes it's simple but at least it makes sense and he doesn't try to make it something that it's not.New VAST territory is broken with "Lost" which has a nice choral sample and electronics. In addition there is an alto sax which gives a nice, soothing feeling to the song. It's really pretty and is one of Crosby's really good tenor tracks vocally. "Japanese Fantasy", while short and repetitive is really good and he does good things with his influences. There is a clever double-chorus and cool keyboards. "Candle" is a good guitar track and has a nice vocal melody. There is a lot to like here, and the stuff just never wears off. Then there's also the bass-heavy "Ecstacy" and the nice downtempo electronic track "I Can't Say No (To You)" which you can hear Jon's emotion in and it's an easy song to relate to. It's songs like this that ask for the "repeat" button on CD players, because they exist and good albums like this are invented for it.Songs like "Be With Me" and "Thrown Away" are standard VAST affairs but do not fail to impress like everything else done. The former has this cool Eastern feel to it and the latter is catchy both lyrically and structurally, which is also why "I Need to Say Goodbye" is so good. Lyrics such as "You took me for all the other fools in your life/now I don't care about your pain anymore" sound really good, showing that this isn't the emo type thing where he'd cry about loss. Instead it's kind of a "f--k you" type song and is done really well.I'm not an emo fan, but I even thoroughly enjoyed "Winter in My Heart" and "Desert Garden" which weren't too far off from that sub-genre. The former is more orchestrated, yet in a good successful way. It's also got some of Jon's more memorable vocals. The other is simple, just Jon and the acoustic guitar. It sounds really good and shows that he can make a stripped down song sound just as great as a multi-layered one. Once again the imagery of the lyrics is brilliant, search the lyrics on Google and you'll see what I mean.Some people just need to get used to what this is. It's not dark like its predecessors but not every great album is dark. I feel like I've been around those people ever since I became a NIN fan, and some VAST fans aren't too different. I mean, if you want it to be the first record, listen to the first record and don't waste your time and money. This music is done for Jon's good and I can't wait to hear what the future of VAST is. Every record is basically flawless, 5-star good. I'm sure some critical people gnash their teeth when they think of the rating for VAST records. Note that one thing about being a VAST fan to begin with is a thing called having an open mind. If you give this the time it needs, you will realize that even having to read reviews like mine is unnecessary when you can get such wonderful albums like this.

Rancid are a band I've been aware of for a long time but only REALLY started paying attention to in recent years. I actually had this burned for awhile, and I didn't realize that I didn't take to it as much as I have now! But what makes this record so great? The songs! Punk has never been about technical ability, and I always found that a little refreshing really, but Rancid may have their big '77 punk influence here, there's also kind of a style of their own on here. In fact, this record was too good for the mainstream to ignore, and it even got some MTV play and gave 'em more sales. Perfect timing too, as them and the Offspring were some of the biggest bands on Epitaph.But it can appeal to the masses and has nice enough messages. Thefirst albumwas recorded before Lars got into the band, and this one has his vocals on it. It's nice to hear the trade of his hard-edged and clear vocals and Tim's vocals which by contrast are more thin and less telligible. It's actually kind of charming. It's hard for me to pick my favorites between the first five songs, but those are not the only great tracks. Tracks like "Ghetto Box" and "Motorcycle Ride" stand out just as well. 23 songs takes awhile to fully adjust to, but once you're familiar, you won't want to stop listening to this. I am also very well aware of...And Out Come The WolvesandIndestructible, which I enjoy. The other three I'm not quite as familiar with yet but they've all been at least four-star good with me by this point.

I think it's extremely inappropriate that metalheads who have no taste for this type of music are writing reviews here. I mean, there's a reason why I don't review a lot of overly mainstream artists/albums, because people of my cohort also realize it's worthless probably andNow, for the review!"X&Y;" is possibly the best of Coldplay's three albums to date, all of which I enjoy to a certain extent. All 13 songs are good. The songs are memorable, and the first five tracks are possibly the greatest ones on the album. I love the atmospherics and structure of the aural bliss of "Square One," "Fix You" is one of the group's greatest ballads, "White Shadows" shows they have edge, "Fix You" is a slow-burner track, and then "Talk" comes in with a cool Kraftwerk riff. None of the songs are really bad, though, and even though their lyrics can be trite and simplistic, that's doesn't completely stand up as a criticism. Kind of like how the cover art is simplistic yet brilliant. Give it the time to listen to it. They might be overhyped but are one of the better mainstream artists around.

One thing that's really amazing about listening to this album is that without being told, you'd never really know when this was released. I myself was shocked to find that this was released in the early 80's as everything I know of from then is of a different ilk.What stands above it is that each of the ten, erm, twelve, songs are full of hooks as well.Who hasn't heard "Blister in the Sun"? That track was tons of fun for me when I first heard it, and it's still not getting old with me."The Kiss Off" has a great intro that follows the bare-bones sound, keeping things acoustic. It's probably known for the counting bridge more than anything.Even the less popular tunes shine as well. "Please Do Not Go" is well-written, the way that a pop song should be done. It's not bubblegum pop I'm referring to, but something with a great structure."Add It Up" gets things to what I consider the album's highlight. One of many songs Gordon wrote during high school, the a cappella intro is interesting, yet it gets better when the bass and guitar join. I love the guitar part at the ending of it. Not surprising when he wrote it; as a teen, I can at times relate to the angst of the album.Then the next song has the greatest opening line of all: "People worry. What are they worried about today?" This is also another highlight, and while a bit repetitive admittedly like much of the album, it works once again. I especially like drummer DeLorenzo's pattern on the beginning of the "have we got an army" part of the song. Five-plus minutes of pure VF greatness alone describes "Confessions".The next songs are also VF greatness. "Promise" is a typical track of teens in the fear of the high school love. "To the Kill" is a great song that refers to Chicago. The chorus is the greatness of it, however.It explodes with the next two songs, though. "Gone Daddy Gonne" is particularly interesting with its use of the xylophone and its excellent structure which gave it a reputation as a classic of the album. "Good Feeling" sounds shockingly happy on this album, yet it's beautiful. It's got the use of the violin on this track.The "bonus" tracks are greatness too. The more punk-y "Ugly" is a great, short track, while "Gimme the Car" is particularly entertaining, especially when you think he's gonna say something, but a guitar fills it in.Each of these tracks are an example of why the band stands the test of time. Anyone unfamiliar with The Femmes' music should check this out, it's more essential than the 'Add it Up' collection, as it has all of the studio versions of VF classics. Anyone will basically like this, from what I believe. These three guys know how to write great songs, and I have been a fan ever since hearing this album.

And one that will be once again frowned upon from people. It's happened with everything Billy-related since 'Adore'. Incidentally, that's probably the album you'll need the most appreciation for to truly enjoy the record. But it's like what 'Adore would have been had Billy replaced the thick, dark gothic sound for something more pink noise and shoegaze. It works really well, and the tracks flow well, even if this is not as good as Billy's other works. It sounds nothing like the indie/country/rock of Zwan, which I thought was pretty good if that was appreciated for what it was. Naturally it had a Pumpkin-lite sound since the main Pumpkins were on it. This time around that only happens for one track and it doesn't sound like Zwan either, although there's nice other instrumentation on that particular track.There are critics who accuse it of being an angst album, but the album is what it implies lyrically. It's not about the fear of the future, Billy states "I'm Ready" in one of his songs, for that. It's a spiritual and relational record that is for people who can appreciate this calmer Billy. I feel that it's not just a "play it safe" record so much as one that was meant to be there for good song writing. You'll get used to the fact that none of these songs are as ambitious as anything else that Billy's done. But get used to it and you'll have an appreciation for 'TheFutureEmbrace'.

When I heard MBV's album "Loveless" for the first time, it was an extremely questionable listen for me. I didn't understand why vocals were there when you couldn't tell what the hell it was saying. I also couldn't get over all of those critics and indie hipsters praising it as "the best album of the 90's", and I really wanted to like it because I knew that they were an influence on so many great bands who followed, like Garbage and the Smashing Pumpkins. Also, the music didn't really do a whole lot for me on the whole.That last sentence is kind of true for me as far as my regard for the thing in full songs. One thing I noticed is that "Loveless" is good for you if you have an open mind for instrumental music. Many things have always stood out to me. I still think the tracks with Kevin Shields on vocals are the best songs. When I heard "When You Sleep", I wondered how they made the guitar sound like a flute! Besides, that track shows a lot of elements that Garbage picked up on and I was able to deciper the opening lines of the verses. Also, there's "Sometimes" which is just really beautiful and rarely has been done by any other artist. It is an example of ideas that I can fully appreciate.As for others, it's more elements in songs that I enjoy than anything else. I like the main, noisy riff on "Only Shallow". For me, that's what makes the song. The interlude, "Touched", is a really brilliant point of the album even if it's not a whole lot like the rest of the album.But as I've said, I still don't think it's one of the greatest albums ever made although I realize that they were actually groundbreakers -- something I always noticed actually. The level of production is kind of surprising for "indie" and in fact really adventurous for that kind of music. But if you like dreamy, swirly, noisy, and drony music, I think you'll find quite a bit to love on "Loveless".

Yes, you read right. Sure, it's their most indulgent work to date, but there is a lot to love about this album. For one thing, it's good to know that the band has matured after 5 years. Also, this time, they don't use anti-religious themes of their older albums, which had songs that turned me off because of that (most of it against Christianity; though I guess it makes sense considering how Maynard was raised). However, some of it about hypocrisy wasn't completely bad, as sometimes that can be true of the believers, but I wish they had left that alone, although I realize many fans enjoyed that, and it's already been done. However, I did enjoy the other songs from them, most of Aenima, although I generally skipped &quot;Eulogy&quot; for obvious reason, but even the interludes were interesting to say the least. &quot;Third Eye&quot; was powerful enough to consider it a great record. Nothing on here that powerful, and not as song-based as Undertow, but still an effort that I love, and it's just as good musically. I didn't mind the other lyrics, though.Also, the music is really interesting to hear, since some songs will be really agressive and then get to a real quiet part. Take for instance, &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;, which has Danny Carey's drumming throughout (best drummer ever!) and great lyrics if you like something angry. It's still melodic, believe it or not. This is the only one where Maynard really screams on the album. After three and a half minutes, it gets much quieter, and there aren't audible lyrics for a while. It gets to that peaceful part for quite awhile, but then the heavy riffage of Adam Jones comes in, and then Maynard's &quot;hope this is what you wanted&quot; shout comes in. It's great that there is all of that in just one song, albeit one that is 8 minutes long.Which is the same length frame as &quot;The Grudge&quot;. I love how it starts immediately, and there are great lyrics on this. Even if you're not a big fan, I would still have to say that they've made better lyrics with each album, this being no exception. It's the only one here that would fit on a past release of theirs, one reason it was great to place it first.&quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; are kind of like two songs in one, something common on this album, so if you like consistency and flow, you've found the right album. It is one of the great moments of the disc. I like the &quot;celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing&quot; lyrics, and musically, the riffs are amazing, especially in the last two minutes of the latter. The first one is like a buildup track to the next, although of course there is lyrics, but distortion doesn't come in yet until you get to &quot;Parabola&quot;.That's not the only place where full songs mold together. There is &quot;Disposition&quot;, &quot;Reflection&quot;, and &quot;Triad&quot; which all flow together. The first of the tracks is interesting, and I like the guitars. The drums sound cool when it ends, then gets to &quot;Reflection&quot;, where it becomes amazing. It's 11 minutes, yet very melodic vocals of Maynard. Probably my favorite track from the album. Then comes in the instrumental &quot;Triad&quot;, which is a great song to end the album, of course excluding the weird &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot;.Everyone's heard &quot;Schism&quot;, and I fell in love with that one from the time I heard the solo section. &quot;The Patient&quot; is kind of funny hearing, as it's like a subconscious message that the band are telling you on the album, seeing as it's 13 tracks that are nearly in an 80 minute record. Not much else to say about that, as this one starts from the interlude-type &quot;Eon Blue Apocolypse&quot;.The title track is a great nine-minute track, which does a lot of things already described, but listening is where you'll find its identity.All in all, you get what you pay for, seeing as this is such a great, powerful album. Not for everyone, but still great. I can't see how too many people who don't like Tool wouldn't like it.

Many of the times I am encountered by hipsters who claim that the view of the album and what Trent sings of are generally just negative and whiny stuff. While that may be the case, I think it could be a lot worse. It is not really that self-indulgent or overly pretentious *cough*prog-rock*cough*. It is also a lot more fun to listen to than most of the "emo" of today. Other than that, this is a fun record of lots of things. Darkness is definitely there, but don't you remember you're listening to Nine Inch Nails?Yes, it's in the lyrics, as well as obviously the instrumentation. People will talk about Trent complaining as if it's in the entire 104 minutes. What you get is 6 of 23 fully instrumental tracks, all brilliant. "The Frail" is merely just an intro to the bouncy "Wretched", but others hold it on their own. There's "Just Like You Imagined" which has APC-like musical proficiency, complete with Bowie pianist Mike Garson. The whole thing really sets a good tone from the album. "Pilgrimage" is a cool track which has this cool marching chants in it, complete with a nice trumpet solo and nice marching-band drumming to conclude the song. "The Mark Has Been Made" is a bit simple, but its classical uses are plain brilliant and when you come down to it like a heavier version of what a band like Air would generally compose. "Complication" is a nice blend of electronic rock, something Reznor has always been an expert at.Those fit nicely with the songs with vocals and whatnot. You can say that it isn't catchy, but I can't really say that about such songs as "We're in This Together", a POSITIVE song about how two can succeed in doing things together, not to mention an amazing guitar solo. Then there's "The Fragile" which has its melodic chorus, repeating "I won't let you fall apart". Easily my favorite moment on the record is the ending track of the first disc, "The Great Below". This expands on 'Spiral''s ambient use but goes the full mile by using basically a full song on it. Instrumentation is somewhat simple, but the whole thing is lovely. Especially the melody of the "ocean pulls me close" thing. He concludes, "I can still feel you/even so far away", which concludes that all critics saying that this album is completely about Trent's inner turmoil are WRONG. Not to mention, the previous song "La Mer", fronted by a female vocalist and mostly instrumental, seems to have a romantic feel to it. Then there's his track to his grandma, "I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally", which he sings, "the smell of sunshine/I remember sometimes.". Similar feelings come on in "Underneath It All", which has a nice stompy, dissonant beat in it.Then the album itself starts out nice enough. "Somewhat Damaged" starts out with a kind of repetitive guitar parts, but the machine like beat delivery comes in as well as Reznor's somewhat calm vocals on part of it. He gets into the screaming parts of it, and it is just a lot of greatness. Then follows the Alan Moulder-influenced "The Day the World Went Away", which is mostly instrumental except for a verse about what's left/remains after the loss of something. It picks up nicely and the guitar plays with the scat chanting. "The Wretched" is a nice, dark, thick song. It can be taken seriously by someone like me, especially considering that when you think about it that it's different from other Reznor works. "Even Deeper" is hip-hop influenced but still very melodic in its track. Reznor's got an emotional feel in it, feeling that even when he does things that satisfy him that possibly there is some wrong. "No, You Don't" is a nice, agressive track that shows that this is the Trent we all know and love. "Into the Void" is catchy, the song that made me love NIN so much in the first place. "Where Is Everybody?" is nice electronica with Reznor's tale of loneliness and into the electro-funk of "Please", media-friendly entertaining bash of "Star****ers, Inc.", then the rest is just beatiful, save for "The Big Come Down" with its interesting instrumentation. I love this one, where he screams in the verses yet sings very melodically in the chorus.That's not to say that it isn't true at all that Reznor doesn't go about the inner demons. I just feel that people are getting really ridiculous about the whole thing. People wouldn't be saying the same thing about this record's brilliance six years later if it wasn't so great. But this album changed what I thought of music for the rest of time. I used to just like songs that were catchy/moving, but Reznor taught me that greatness lied in albums that were more of experiences than anything else. Which this is. Oh, also, he takes five years because he only releases what he feels is necessary. Unlike bands who are only releasing albums for the sake of it. This is worth $25.

Although, depending on how you see it, it may not be an actual album, being that it's mostly covers and only one song is actually new. Since the site doesn't bump reviews & I took mine of theexplicit versiondown, I may as well just post this here.The album was released on the last election day as one of many political releases at the time. Propaganda aside, it's respectable that an artist can make covers that are drastically different from the original. Too bad they forgot about hooks and good songs for most part. The majority of this is like a badMer de Noms, pretty much like what this would be if you took out the album's romanticism and melody.That being said, there are some saving grace moments that stop me from giving this an even lower score. "Fiddle and Drum" is done excellent, and it's pretty beautiful here. Shows what can happen with Maynard gone right. I actually like "Passive," even if it was supposed to be in the hands of the Tapeworm project that never saw the light of day. Some of these in addition are not too bad -- I like the "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding" remake as well.However, points get deducted in the mix with a horrid Depeche Mode remake, something I never thought I'd see coming from a band like this. Many moments here are failed and monotonous. They've done great before in covers. Remember "The Nurse Who Loved Me"? That was one of the group's better moments. To remind you how much the times suck, they also had to change optimistic gems like "Imagine" and "What's Goin' On" to dreary garbage. Not too many people I know even like this release, and I'm even talking Maynard fans. It's best off forgotten and getting as many copies in the used CD bin as the unjustly malignedR.E.M.'s Monster.I don't think we should forget about APC, just this album. Go for the first two records; those are infinitely better than this.

R.E.M.'s first of album of the '90s, Out Of Time, has the band at their poppiest. Some songs here sound like their from the 80s. While some songs turn out great, there are others that I find hard to stomach. It's not as good as any of their other 90s works, that's for sure.It starts out with the middle-of-the-road "Radio Song", with organs playing, guest rapping from KRS-One. I don't care a whole lot for it. "Losing My Religion" has good but overrated mandolin instrumentals. It is good, even as overrated and overplayed as it was. It didn't ruin the song though. "Low" is one of my favorites. It's kind of dark-sounding, and low-key. It's a real awesome track.Then it all crashes down with the Mike Mills-led "Near Wild Heaven", which I find unlistenable. Dissapointing 'cuz his backing vocals have always been real good. "Endgame" is a snoozer instrumental, and it goes nowhere, so I skip that. "Shiny Happy People" is a rather embarrasing song of theirs. And it sounds real dated as well.The next noteworthy song is "Texarkana", a beautiful, melodic track. This time the vocals turn out right and everything goes right.Then I really can't stand "Country Feedback", the music just doesn't fit with my hearing.The last track is mediocre, as are the one that I hadn't mentioned.If you like poppier R.E.M., you may like this. Also, if you're a huge R.E.M. fan, you may like it as well. However, if you are like me and tried understanding the hype, you may want it either burned or for a low used price. I wouldn't shell out $15 on this, yet I don't find enough stuff I don't like to say it's not recommended at all. I prefer the 80s stuff and Automatic..., but that's just me.

Following their EP and "Tripping the Light Fantastic", Lit later decided to sign on to RCA and record their third album "A Place in the Sun". Even though they chose an awful producer in Don Gilmore, his sound did not overpower the excellence of the record. It's actually one of his okay productions and I don't mind the polished sound at all. In fact, I don't really mind what he did here, but sometimes he makes a great record turn into mainstream fluff of the most generic kind.I remember this album in my youth in that it was probably my favorite album when it was out, and Lit were my favorite band. While I've changed some since I was 12/13, I still thoroughly enjoy the record. It's been six years later and I don't mind popping this album in once in a while, even if I've had a shift in music tastes towards more "experimental" stuff. A good record always sounds good no matter what you're acquired to.You'd be surprised to know the variety and creativity that Lit actually has. This one has "My Own Worst Enemy" and that one should be known for its great riffage and anthem of rather silly times. It was power pop at its best. It's known above their other material and probably will be known through time because it's one of those songs that you don't forget after you hear it.There are quite interesting songs. It's obvious here that they had a variety of influences. There's "Down" which has an old rock sound sort of, with A. Jay singing in a rather different way than usual. The bridge is also really great. I also enjoy the line, "f**ked up my G-whites parking parallel". Then there's tracks like the ska-rock "Happy", which are lots of fun to hear. It's great, because even when not happy, he wants to be happy. Can't you relate to that?The songs in between what I mentioned are interestingly also worth a mention. There's "Four" which starts the album in a great way and has a nice guitar solo. There's "Lovely Day" that has a hook-y melody that you'll like if you're expecting another "MOWE". I think if you get over your elitist thoughts of Lit that you'll realize that the criticism is pretty much stupidity. Saying Lit aren't punk is not that far off though; they play all kinds of rock. "Quicksand" has interesting guitar and bass lines in it, the nice theme riff gives it a somewhat different feel for the album. Not to mention, the catchy opening of "When I bring it up/you shut me out/so I keep on writing letters to myself". Also, you may have heard the heavy-but-slow "Perfect One", which is good, although not spectacular. The variety in the disc is what makes it so great. Then there's dark guitars on "The Best Is Yet to Come Undone" and then you get to the So-Cal pop-punk of "A Place in the Sun", and the screaming towards the end sounds like they were happy making the track. The lyrics, once again, are clever.I'll admit that sometimes it's better to listen to this album in parts rather than the whole, but if you think you don't like this album I think you are lying to yourself. Clever lyrics and talent rule this album and that's a good thing, because more bands like that will be remembered. Contrary to the ridiculous belief, it never really sounded too much like blink-182, just people who decided to lump bands together for no good reason said it did. While maybe not a classic, you are likely going to enjoy it. It's about girls and cars mostly but has actual substence and is clever. Also buy "Tripping the Light Fantastic" and "Lit". Even better albums.

You know, tribute albums are things I rarely ever care for. In fact, one CD that I would sell if I get the oppurtunity is this one of boring U2 covers that I accidentally bought. But this album not only has some artists who already had a name, but some of the less obvious DM influences. This is part of why I appreciate this CD. Some of the covers were kind of surprising, like "Monument" from "A Broken Frame," and also "Shame" (covered by Self, the only artist I had never heard of prior to this compilation) which I wasn't aware of before I got this. While it's clear how heavily influenced a group like God Lives Underwater is by the group, I wouldn't have known that Monster Magnet and Dishwalla were groups who got influenced by DM.It's a pretty good tribute, as well. It's really interesting to hear Locust's (not to be confused with the noisecore group) interpretation of "Master and Servant." I never have thought of an S&M-themed; song being played so mellow and playful. I really liked Failure's take on "Enjoy the Silence" and the one track I had always been familiar with was the Pumpkins' take on "Never Let Me Down Again." It's surprising that they play that one clean, especially being a B-side of the distortion-happy "Siamese Dream" era. Basically, the first five tracks are my favorites. It is more hit than miss.There are a couple points that don't really do it for me. "Monument" was never really a favorite of mine to begin with, and I don't care for the remake, either. I wish Monster Magnet would've embraced their style a little bit more on "Black Celebration" as well.Overall, if you like '90s electronic and alternative music, I recommend this. You'll respect it even if you don't enjoy it. Totally worth getting.

Well, that could be subjective, but the thing is, while it was the first of two albums during the band's stay at Island, this album is the most immediate Thrice album of the four already released. Less experimental thanVheissuand more in the melodic side thanThe Illusion of Safety, this record works perfectly well. Like many albums with Andy Wallace involved, the tracks mesh together incredibly well. For some it makes the songs sound the same, for me it just makes the record sound more increidble than it already did. The melodies here are strong and the songs are catchy enough to stick with the listener."Cold Cash and Colder Hearts" and "Under the Killing Moon" make an excellent one-two punch on the album. The first one displays a more orchestrated sound than before while still melodic, but more ambitious than possibly expected at the time. "Killing Moon" is one of the heaviest tracks on the album, and you still get some of the metallic riffage that made the band so great from the last time.The record is most known for the two singles "All That's Left" and "Stare at the Sun" which I thought would have been huge at the time. They weren't quite that but it showed that even at their most commercial they could stick to their strengths. The latter is my favorite track on the intro, with one of the most incredible openings of a song. The lyrics on the particular track prove to be hopeful.There are other heavier moments on here. If that's what you are looking for, "Silhouettes," "Paper Tigers," and "Hoods on Pepegrine" should work for you quite well. And at times the songs blend the strengths and work into even better tracks. "Black Holes and Blood Clots" is a personal favorite of mine that meshes the melodic and heavy sides successfully from the band. Then there's beautiful moments like in "The Melting Point of Wax," which furthers orchestration and is the only track of the like after the first track. The title track is pretty immediate as well and the record makes for quite a catchy listen. I usually hate when people associate the band with screamo, but on this release I admit that I sort of tend to see it. Still, if you're the least bit open-minded you'll realize it's not always a bad thing (and did you remember Quicksand?) and get into some of the songs as well.The songs here are short yet get to the point and satisfy the listeners easily. The band's lyrics are top-notch once again and have a delivery on many levels. Maybe not for someone who dislikes something that sounds like it could be big, but otherwise it's completely recommendable. My start and I recommend this as yours as well.

Okay, so I guess they're not my favorite type of thing, but the Mars Volta are guys whose music I respect a lot more than I actually enjoy it. I am particularly a big fan ofDe-Loused in the Comatoriumand that EP, but after that I've cared less and less about the band. I recognize that sometimes you want to expand your sound and be more detailed, but when you take it over the top like these guys are doing here it weighs down what may otherwise make the songs worthwhile.I gaveFrances the Mutea free pass, kind of ignoring the signs that they were a lot closer to an album like this because even with less great song writing there were still some enjoyable moments, although I would have cut that song that stretched out in 8 tracks (although that part is the record label's fault & not theirs). Some of these songs are actually good, but I am too bored by the majority of it. It's as if they try being more progressive than they actually are. I find that many of the bands either really hit with me (i.e. Porcupine Tree) or miss with me (i.e. Coheed).There's no denying that the band has talent but it's not like it's really worth it when they take over-detailed and stretched elements in favor of tunefulness. I do need some of that in a record, and that's usually what makes me like an album a lot more. It isn't the worst thing I've heard but I could think of many better ways to spend time than listening to these eight songs in one hour.If you didn't mind the more progressive tendencies on "FTM" though it may be worth a shot for you. Because it didn't appeal to you doesn't mean it won't to you either, although it's making me skeptical as to whether I should bother with what the band is doing later. If you didn't like that album I don't think that you'll like this one either.

Sometimes you hear nothing from an artist before, but you become a fan after hearing a song, album, or whatnot. While the band hadn't had much of a fan base yet during the first two albums, they came the indie hype as the third album, "White Blood Cells", was released. It's also the album that got them a major label deal and some hits. And it's the album that turned me on to this band and automatically made them favorites of mine. And it's the type of album that is meant for repeat listens. Whether you like garage, blues, rock, or indie, it's for you. "White Blood Cells" is not deep because it does not have to be, and the fact that's unpretentious makes it even better.It's Jack's lyrics and guitar riffs and Meg's similarly minimalistic drumming that makes the two stand out. Also, the fact that the tracks are pretty diverse in spite the minimalism. The opener "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" is what got me hooked on the album with its romanticism and Zeppelin-like melody, as well as the fact that the distortion worked well with the track. And that's not the only great track. "Fell in Love with a Girl" and "We're Going to Be Friends" are sweet pop tracks; the former being more quirky yet very catchy, the latter being a gentle, beautiful ballad about childhood. Those two tracks make the album accessible enough for the beginner.The album has many parts and places. There's country in the vein of "Hotel Yorba" which is still energetic and unmistakably Stripes, the piano track "This Protector" which is a nice changed pace for the album's close, and many other greats. In some ways it seems that "Little Room" could refer to the band's success or just thinking big in general, but it's a nice short number."The Union Forever" is classic Stripes, through its chords and melody and lyrics, whether or not due to Citizen Kane relevance. There's wit found on the album in "I'm Finding It Harder to Be a Gentleman", more quirkiness and greatness of "I Think I Smell a Rat" and the feedback-based instrumental "Aluminum" or the catchiness like "Offend in Every Way".However you put it, there's not really any filler in the album. There's something in here for everyone and yet it doesn't sound like the work of people compromising art. I highly recommend "WBC" as a starting point of the Stripes collection. While not as bluesy as the first two albums (especially "De Stijl") or as dark as later efforts, there's still quite a bit that stands out well on this album. It's better than anything the counterpart "The" bands have done in their time, and I enjoy the Hives a lot too, so that says something.

In the midst of Stripes hype, I'd dedicate this review to my favorite album of all-time, even though this was a predecessor of their success. It's a step up from the 1999 debut album, even though they don't have as full of energy, more interesting elements appear and there is more songs that I just love. This album is short, but gives you enough fun to where it doesn't matter on the length. This album is not really first listen, but that's 'cuz some stuff just isn't exactally what you hear today."Apple Blossom" is an excellent Beatlesque song, and I love repeating that one a lot. Jack sounds grat. They've got great energy on "Jumble, Jumble", a completely flawless song that shows their rock-like moments. It even ends with an excellent cover of "Your Southern Can Is Mine", and another blues cover, "Death Letter", which is very inspired.Zep and Beatle influences are very apparent here, though some stuff is so good you love it in the first listen. "Why Can't You Be Nicer To Me" has excellent guitar lines, and the couplets in this song are great, and simple ("people don't even know me/but they know how to show me").Truly, there's not a whole lot I can say about it, though it is excellent. Tracks 7 and 9 are fun listening to, 'cuz they're a little different from the others. The guitars show the blues influence, and the former is a cleverly written one, whereas the other's highlight is Jack's understated vocals.It's got a great opener track with the garage pop of "You're Pretty Good Looking". I love the bridge, it's what sticks out the most. Jack sounds better than he does on the first album, and you know from this one. "Hello Operator" is a step up from the debut. Meg's drums fit nicely in it, and this shows why it's necessary to have her in the Stripes. After her drum taps, the guitars continuing exploding from their break. I love how Jack sounds on this one.And also like their first album, probably the most like it, is "Let's Build A Home", which starts out with a clip of Jack as a kid singing a song, then the guitars come in, and it's in the minimal style of TWS that we all love. The lyrics are very simple ("I'm getting lazy won't you throw me a bone..."), and it definitely sounds like it's from a rock and roll album.If you followed the hype that they're at now, you're gonna like 'De Stijl'. There's no filler, and while some songs do stand out, later in listens the ones that don't end up being excellent at first actually are. If you want to look at their back catalog before they were popular, this is good for you.

You know, it's awkward. Rarely have I discovered work from an artist that makes me go back to their predecessors and then it seems like the previous work either seemed inferior or like they weren't trying enough. It's awkward, but that's how it's working for me with B.R.M.C. The first two albums I like but don't love now, even though they both came out in my indie-happy days. This album has a certain depth to it that makes it so amazing and legitimate. The songs are catchy like the last time, but they feel less empty this time around. This sound actually works for them better than the previous sound. All 13 songs are wonderful. I heard "Ain't No Easy Way" on the radio and loved it. I did not know that I was going to hear an album where 12 songs were even better. There is a certain variety, some of it bluesy, some of it rockin', all of it just plain ol' good. "Howl" and "Devil's Waiting" are probably the tracks that I like the most, but gosh, I didn't even realize before the last time I listened to this how much I enjoy it. Highly recommended. Production and songs are both great. Hmmm, I see the site lists it as an Enhanced CD album, but that's not the format mine's in. Although as far as I know, it is one of those copy protection things. Oh well, blame that on RCA and leave it to the band for these songs.

I honestly had written a review for this album in thestandard versionof the album but in retrospect I felt like I was going too far in defending the record and not enough in detail of what made the record what it was in the first place. I know I won't reach that in my review, and it really requires listening to find that one out.But now that we have the different editions, you may be wondering what's on this release that isn't on the original. None of the songs are different from standard (and to the person who said "Lullaby" is here: It's really onHopelessly Devoted to You, Vol. 6and is worth listening to), but you get awesome liner notes about each song from each band member, and it's pretty enlightening. Nick Bogardus, the group's manager, puts the foreward about the sessions and the whole ideas put through at the time. Also, the shining deluxe cover art is somewhat different. Me I own both versions because I love this so much.One thing that's great about "Vheissu" is that where previous albums were less distinguishable, Thrice improved that with each album and that problem doesn't even really exist here. Some songs have similar formulas but none of them really sound that much alike. Besides, you have to know you're really listening to an album and not a mixtape.The album starts with the sound of a morse code which I don't think was a first for a band but puts a nice twist to the song. "Image of the Invisible" is probably the most immediate song on the entire album, with its call and response verses and melodic yet heavy chorus. The bridge also gives it more character and does not sound in any way out of place with the songs."Between the End and Where We Lie" is a somewhat more poppy song from the group but not in a watered down way so much as a more lighthearted song. It sounds like it could have fit onThe Artist in the Ambulancefor most part but it also has some real nice textured drums that distinguish it from that previous album and the chorus totally moves. It shows sonic growth and is like a more sophisticated version of what they had done."The Earth Will Shake" is an awesome track inspired by field recordings, and the recording of the song reflects upon that. It is pretty melodic yet it becomes really intense as you get enough into the song. It also starts out acoustic which is the first time that happens on the album. But in the end, Teppei's awesome riffs steal the show like they always do."Atlantic" is a really mellow track and one of the few Thrice songs exploring love. That being said it's not cheesy or sappy in the least. The chords are pretty memorable and the tune is more atmospheric than anything they had ever otherwise done. It is a really gorgeous song and warrants many repeat listens."For Miles" opens with piano and a nice melody and has some darker lyrics from the album. Yet even that one's pretty hopeful. I usually disagreed and scoffed at the comparisons to Radiohead and Coldplay, thinking people were really getting carried away, yet you can hear that on some of this one. I really like Teppei's riffs through most of the songs, and it's one of the songs ending with some of the screams of Dustin, but that keeps the depth in the songs.After those two songs, you may be wondering, "Where's my precious hardcore?" Well, we've got three words for you: "Hold Fast Hope." Even that one's got a bridge nice enough to even out for some who aren't fond of music that hits you like a freight train. Although there's nothing quite like an intense song that really does open with something like "How can you be sleeping/waves like weapons crash." That would wake ME up, at least. I don't mind but in songs this length a track like this was welcome. Interesting signature in the drums and in spite being pretty heavy Dustin still sings through most of the chrous. The chords are nice in the end and in a way that kind of reminds me of "As the Ruin Falls" from the early days.The group also uses the music box in the song with the same name, and that gives the song a nice effect. It otherwise isn't a more compelling track musically, at least what's also given in here, but it still is wonderful. This is where spiritual allusions really start kicking in, although arguably they do through the whole album, even insisting, "we are sons an heirs of love." Oh, and for those who stereotype them with emo, it says "keep your chin up child/and wipe the tears from your eyes" so that's a big bite in the tongue. Its emotional depth hits.More into the Biblical themes is "Like Moths to Flame" which has always been a personal favorite although not always mentioned as a highlight by the bigger fans of the group. This in particular speaks in Peter's perspective, but I think even if you aren't really religious you'll find something in this to enjoy. Thrice is about the music but there's always a depth beyond it as well. It totally moved this listener at "You surprised me when you said I'd fall away/don't you know me/I could never be ashamed of you," and the delievery at that line. One of those with screaming in its end as well, but something like this can only be presented with that kind of urgency.The chords that open "Of Dust and Nations" are quite interesting and there's a real warmth in the falsetto of the track. It is a more melodic moment of "Vheissu" and doesn't stray too far away from the old formula if you ask me, which had some songs that weren't really heavy, either. While somewhat somber sounding at first it is really a positive track like much of the record.And nothing as encouraging as a record that this far in is still telling you to "Stand and Feel Your Worth," even if that has its spiritual and Biblical references just as well. It's the longest track on the album and is a more slow song on the record just as well. A lot of the second half is a bit slower, though. I don't think it's a bad thing in the least. And nothing moved me like hearing the coda where it screams "Awed by grace I fall on my face." Technically my least favorite song here but even that's incredible."Red Sky" end things and is more atmospheric kind of like "Atlantic" is but this one doesn't only refer to the water; it's about an actual experience on a ship and gives a beautiful image in the lyrics. Also unlike "Atlantic" it has a bit more of an up-front chorus but it works really well with the album. It kind of predicts a taste of things to come, with its verses personifying the wind and the ocean. And it's a high note for the record just as well.You get eleven tracks full of the energy and depth that drew people into the band in the first place. The sound may be different from old records but most bands who truly have integrity would either take themselves to a new challenge (like these guys are doing here) or would not continue if they couldn't continue the classic formula and make it honest for themselves at the point. It is not an easy first listen for some but it is music that goes in each part of the map. In spite added keyboards and more textured percussion it isn't really electronic. There's elements of hardcore but it's more backbone than in previous records. "Vheissu" is basically just in a class of its own. I've never heard anything quite like it and I still am not getting enough of it after a few years. I enjoy all of the band's records but I don't see anything hitting quite like this record already has. Add this to the band's winners.

It's kind of a shame that this two-disc edition of the Pumpkin's greatest hits is only available in one way now, and the less satisfying way. Either way, this disc is for just about everybody, later fans and casual fans especially. A lot of people complain about how this was put, but honestly, every single one of these songs included on the first disc was a hit. They made songs for all kinds of audiences. It starts out with the psychedelic hard rock of "Siva" and the excellent new-wave and grunge mix of "Rhinoceros", although it's not the "Gish" version, it's the edited for radio one. Same applies for the "Singles" song "Drown", which is originally eight minutes but was cut down halfway for the radio. The three main hits from "Siamese Dream" also appear, and then there's five songs from "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness". Later part is definitely for the goths, particularly "Eye". The only exclusion which seems questionable is "The End is the Beginning is the End". That track was excellent and would make haters of the soundtrack be able to listen to great music on a disc and throw the other out the window. Then there's the two hits from each "Adore" and "Machina". The two new songs are not actually anything special, but we get to hear the final Pumpkins single, "Untitled" here, as well as the "Machina II" track "Real Love".The second disc has several of tracks that are new, although many which are old. "Believe", an Iha-penned song, and "Set the Ray to Jerry" are taken from the "1979" single, while "Marquis in Spades" and the excellent "Aeroplane Flies High" had previously existed on Pumpkin singles. The treat here is you get some songs from "Machina II", and some songs that were prevously unavailable "Adore" outtakes. While simply worse than anything else on that record, "Because You Are" has a cool sound and kind of resembles a James Bond theme song while "Blissed and Gone" is just plain amazing, as you can feel the pain in Corgan's vocals there. There are also some unreleased covers, and while the "Rock On" version is subpar, the collection is what's worth it.If you want to introduce someone to the Pumpkins this would be a very good deal. It's everything that it could have been at its best. And I don't even like greatest-hits compilations that much.

And to tell you the truth, I'm a fairweather fan of metal at best, but if it's done in a way that I would like, then I go for it. I'm more into stuff like NIN and the Smashing Pumpkins in general, but listening to older works by the latter and listening to this shows that there was an influence of this on my favorite bands as well (Tool are a good example of a favorite of mine with a great Sabbath influence). There is a reason why several songs on this album, as the editorial review says, ended up on the greatest-hits album: Every single track on this album is a classic. And some artists will sometimes even release 3 times as much and not have the ideas executed nearly as well.There is nothing but talent executed on the record, and rather than sound like a trainwreck mess that is directionless (that happens sometimes with actually talented bands), they turn in for some great songs. I particularly love "Electric Funeral", a great example of a track which uses the "wah" effect to put an interesting atmosphere. I really love the bridge and guitar solo where the tempo changes in it. I assume you've already heard "Iron Man" if you're looking here. Well if you haven't then go familiarize yourself. Even if you don't like the album I have no idea how you couldn't at least respect the music for what it did. And it's quite a bit different than Led Zeppelin in fact. I love that band too, but this is darker and more metal. They've got a great bassist in Geezer Butler that hearing is part of why you'd buy this. Even the straightforward and simple "Paranoid." doesn't fail in its delivery. Then towards the end you get to the lesser known songs, and neither are any less good. Where Ozzy's vocals usually goes with the guitar and/or bass, that starts to change when you get to "Hand of Doom", one of the greatest bass tracks on the album. "Rat Salad" is an interesting track to say the least, almost like an intermission between "Doom" and "Jack the Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots". I don't know if it's very easy to say much negative about the album. I feel like while you can say hard-rock totally existed before Black Sabbath, and metal bands were around, Black Sabbath were the band where the genre finally became itself. However, it would not have mattered if the musicianship and songs weren't as good, and thus wouldn't have been near as much of an influence. And the album is just proof of that, and you are not going to need to be convinced by some person just making an attempt to say something that they think of certain albums.**Side note: Don't take many of the negative reviews seriously. Although I can't believe that some people would say some of what they did. They might be jokes but that joke stopped being funny halfway through. Skip over this and decide to buy the album if you haven't already, by the way.**

The beginning of Mode's years was kind of interesting. The periods done in each of these tracks are all notable. There's the Vince Clarke stuff, when Gore took the lead songwriting role, and the time Alan Wilder stepped in. Also interesting is the liner notes, which contain one negative and one positive review for each (well, almost) of the singles. There are some classics here: "Everything Counts" is still one of DM's greatest songs, a beautiful, yet moving track."People Are People" was made to be a hit, and even broke them through stateside. In spite what the band may say, it's a wonderful track. "New Life" and "Just Can't Get Enough" are as well, and you get a short introduction to Gore's dark lyrics in "Master and Servant" and "Blasphemous Rumors." Also, a track like "Love, In Itself" shows the group making some pretty unique tracks. Even nearly 25 years later, it sounds like nothing else. I like the samples used on there. Also, the version of "Photographic" here is, in my opinion, even better than the version on "Speak & Spell." You even get a preview at the beginning of tracks with Martin Gore in lead vocals ("Somebody"), although not many singles after would feature him. It's worth owning to hear the two non-album tracks, "Shake the Disease" and "It's Called a Heart."Of course, there's also a few low spots. "See You" may have been a hit but hasn't aged well and is hookless really. "The Meaning of Love" is kind of a mediocre attempt at re-creating a "Speak" track. The debut "Dreaming of Me" is okay, but really, DM had a lot better after that one.All in all, this is an interesting look at one of my all-time favorite groups. Yes, the later one is better ("The Singles 86>98"), but that's also because almost every song there is absolutely wonderful, but this shows who Depeche are at least as much as later stuff. That's the great thing about them: The singles collections show who they are equally as much as the albums do.

Well, if you read Rolling Stone and Spin (as well as Maxim's Blender), they both have one thing in common: Both are about image and pop culture as opposed to actual musical stuff. For awhile AP got way too trendy for me. However, this magazine is on track. Whereas many of the other magazines will only discuss things from artists that are real obvious "elitist" picks and heavy sellers, this album is for people who know of other great music.It's got a lot about goth/industrial/heavy stuff, as mentioned earlier. I have to respect them because they actually had a cool article on my favorite artist of all-time, VAST. They are interesting people who like interesting things. I imagine that I'll keep my subscription of this because it's from people who clearly know what they are doing.Even though they rarely update, Industrial Nation is recommended in addition to this wonderful magazine. I wish people would find that there is a lot of good stuff there that people aren't giving a chance at.

Some people may look at the album and complain, "there's only 9 songs." ("Genesis" is merely an intro track). But honestly, I think one thing that made hip-hop go in a downfall is unnecessary excess. That's what makes listening to this refreshing even over 12 years later. All of the tracks are great, too. Yes, it is somewhat overrated, but mainly because critics don't give other great later albums a chance, even though they are great. I don't like it when elitists won't even acknowledge "It Was Written." To call tracks particular highlights is somewhat of a stretch, since they are all great. However, probably because it's the track that I'm most familiar with I tend to really enjoy "The World Is Yours," which shows that he can make catchy songs that do not have to be disposable or nonsense. "Illmatic" is worth a listen to anyone who respects hip-hop. It's not just a "historical landmark," it is an album that is also respected for its legitamacy. Also refreshing is that while the period this was out was mostly gangsta flare, Nas was willing to talk about other interesting life subjects. And yes, even after all of these years, Nas is one of the greatest emcees around, especially of the mainstream. And he doesn't need to use many guests to back this up, nor any real interludes.

In the past year or so I have become pretty much a die-hard Thrice fan. I went backwards in their catalog and was glad to come into this one eventually, seeing as I initially ignored it (I saw ads for it but never heard anything from the band until circaThe Artist in the Ambulance.) I kind of regret the fact that I did this, but I thought I was into a different path musically back then as well.What's incredible is that the release was turned down by many punk labels who criticized that the album was all over the place and directionless. Or more importantly that a band should be either heavy or melodic and such. This is ridiculous in retrospect; even from a mainstream perspective, did that many label people never even hear of the Deftones?That aside, the songs themselves are great. I would be proud to have a debut album as well made as this. Not really hi-fi, but there's a certain edge in the earlier albums. Even though they were not as ambitious as in later releases, it is very strong for what it is. Recommended for fans of the more hardcore variety of punk. There's a lot of melody injected, so it makes good sense they later covered Minor Threat. There's not a lot similar though past that. In a genre that wallows sometimes in stupidity levels of anguish and such, they always made hopeful music even on here. The opening of "To What End" totally rules, as does the title track, and "Ultra Blue" is one of the catchier songs and possibly my favorite on the album. It seems that "T&C;" seems to be a popular favorite, which is a great track as well. In that song it shows that even when the band members were very young that Dustin (along with his effortless passion which is incredible) was still a great lyricist and that Teppei was an accomplished guitarist.It doesn't get as much recognition as later works, but it isn't bad at all. I suggest it for people who were okay with the next two albums. Arguably still their weakest but only because of what came later.

Over the years, Radiohead have released top-notch albums, that can be said. Amnesiac, however, isn't as impressive as I'd like it to be. I know I'll get a lot of [complaints] from their fans, although Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. I like The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and the new one, Hail To The Thief, don't own and haven't heard Pablo Honey, and though I like this, some of it I can't get into no matter how hard I try. Maybe because it is sort of Kid A rejects, and I respect their ideas, even though it only works on some of the tracks. There are 4 songs that I think are good. Yeah, that's all.The only one I completely hate on here is "Morning Bell/Amnesiac". It was excellent on Kid A, but this version is just discombobulated.As for the good, the good tracks are very good. "Pyramid Song" is an awesome chill song, and has one of Thom's best melodies. The song is haunting at times, and as every single other Radiohead video, the video is great."You And Whose Army" is the obvious standout track here. It rivals out even some of their best work. It shows that they are one of the most important artists of the Britpop generation. It would've been good enough to appear on OK Computer."I Might Be Wrong" is just awesome. It's catchy and avant-garde simultaneously. Thom's falsetto works great on this one. Funky guitars, sort of bluesy tune."Knives Out" is really cool too. I love the guitars, and it does make a great single. Even people who detest this album can enjoy this.As for the rest, it ranges from tolerable to annoying. It opens up with "Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box", which has sort of techno-ish beats of Kid A, nothing special, but it's alright. Kind of repetitive and whiny, but it's nothing that would turn you off."Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors" starts out with an awesome techno beat, but after awhile it gets real self-indulgent and you realize it's just nonsense about kinds of doors."Dollars & Cents" is a song that I am kind of indifferent to. It's a little hard for me to sit throught this whole song, but it's not bad."Hunting Bears" is a song I have no opinion on as well. I do think it's cool how it's the polar opposite of "Treefingers" from Kid A. Somewhat reminds me of "I Might Be Wrong". Very short.The last track is a little interesting even though it does nothing for me. It's kind of a New Orleans jazz type song, that is actually unique. The song's kind of blary for my tastes, and seems like it tries to be something else, so I really can't get into it a whole lot, though I still continue to try.It's worth it, but if you're not a fan of Radiohead, I wouldn't recommend you buy it. It's not tuneless or anything, but you may find it whiny, self-indulgent, and pretentious if you start here. It's very overrated, that's for sure, and the band's always been a little. "I Might Be Wrong", but it's Radiohead's weakest album to me.

True, people may have put her hype to an unrealistic proportion before the album's release, but truth be told, "Corinne Bailey Rae" is a solid and nearly exceptional debut record. Corinne has a beautiful voice and soothing music to go as the soundtrack with it. Being as this is just the beginning, I can only wonder what's coming next from her. It succeeds in being melodic/soulful, sunny, and heart-warming at times. She's pretty talented, and I think if you have taste for soul, jazz, pop, pop-rock, and blues, you'll enjoy this album. And perhaps you're not usually even a follower of those types of music. Me, I tend to be an alternative and electronic rock type guy, but am sold on this record.There are many highlights. "Like a Star" is a wonderful way to open the album, and the punch continues with "Enchantment" and the big, feel-good single "Put Your Records On." I tend to like the first half more, which is the case with many CD's I own, but there's still moments there, like "Choux Pastry Heart" and "I'd Like to," which actually reminds me of some moments on Lauryn Hill's solo debut album (although as an artist, she's got more in common with India.Arie).It is highly recommended, and if you feel like a lot of music out today is garbage, I suggest you check out some of the actual quality stuff, like this great release.

Upon listening to "Playing the Angel", the new DM record, I knew I was going to like it. I like every DM album; including the ones the fans usually complain about, although I'm not much of a "Speak & Spell" fan. But I knew that I liked "Exciter", and most bands who've been around as long as DM don't even have to prove themselves by trying to break a whole lot of ground. What should be considered is if the album sounds good or not, if the lyrics are good or not, things like that. And in both accounts it is excellent. I PITY anyone who doesn't like this release. They are missing out on something that I never thought I could expect out of these guys. It has quite varied sounds in it. It can be pretty edgy at times like in "A Pain That I'm Used To" and "The Sinner in Me"; especially the bridge/coda of the latter. Even those songs have little lacking in melody, another standout quality of this album.Dave Gahan's contributions are good too, notably "Suffer Well". While not extraordinary, it gets a five by my standards even with his other two because the surprisingly good material is what stands out. Sure, it doesn't seem like "Violator" now, and isn't as immediate. But once you've been blown away, the same can never happen with you immediately again.Oh, and comparing it to U2 in recent years is just ludicrous. Everything from "Songs" to here blows what U2 have done since "Pop" out of the water. Very little about "Playing the Angel" even seems forced to me. I'm kind of superficial about high-tech sound, and so I really tend to like this album. Where the production was more of the strength with "Exciter", it's in the songwriting in this one. "Damaged People" additionally is beautiful.

Okay, just like all the other posters here, I'm a Refused fan. I especially love their opusThe Shape of Punk to Come, and I recognize this sounds NOTHING like the four records that they made. Is that a bad thing? Not particularly. But it's not like experimental music is always rewarding and this is just proof of that.There is some really good moments. During the first two tracks (or halfway on the second one) I thought it would be something that I was going to totally enjoy. But if I could describe you this album in one word I'd say it's "pretentious" and that's even and UNDERSTATEMENT.Prime example: You get a 20 minute "trippy" track where a guy is just speaking through the majority song and well, the guys play some background music. And this isn't even the ONLY song that is like that either; there are two others. I guess it's not a horrible thing but it's not the type of thing I listen to a record for, either.There's highlights and it's interesting but stuff like this is the bulk of the album if there's EIGHT tracks total. The first track where they just shout is actually kind of fun and then I really like "Words Rebel and Hiss" although even THAT ONE is too ruined by being overlong and in an unnecessary way.So the way I see it it's kind of a wasted effort. Refused are and always will be wonderful but the way I see it neither Text or INC were really that amazing, but at least the latter has SONGS as the bulk of their material. I'm sure a lot of people here like praising the more obscure stuff from their collections, but that doesn't always make it better. It doesn't on the surface make it worse automatically but it's not really great music. I own it still but it's not one of the better albums I have.

I haven't heard any of the group's other albums, but I recently got around to "Bloodletting" after finding it for cheap. I had heard the title track which was pretty memorable and one my parents had listened to when I was pretty young, as well as "Joey" and "Tomorrow, Wendy." The latter is so stand-out-ish. It's disturbing yet beautiful and I don't know what draws me into the track. It has such a cynical view on the world, yet somehow it really appeals to me.However, I will give one warning: If you don't like dark music that is also humorless, you're not going to enjoy "Bloodletting." Aside from the fact that it arguably takes it self a bit too seriously, and some tracks come off as rather average on here, but there are plenty of great cuts -- particularly "The Sky Is a Poisonous Garden" and "Darkening of the Light." It is well written and performed, though.

Whenever an artist brings out a retrospective, longtime fans are destined to make complaints. But it needs casual fans in mind and the general consensus and the public's familiarity is mostly in the group's first two records. I don't disagree that the later work was great, but as far as the music that's inside here it's definitely five-star material.For die hards, "#1 Crush" and "The World Is Not Enough," some excellent singles, are available on a Garbage album for the first time. Also, there's a completely new track on here called "Tell Me Where It Hurts" which is excellent, recommended to fans of the new-wave-y tracks.The production here updates things from the cassette-quality production of the shoegaze-style debut album. There's 18 tracks and none of 'em are bad ones, not even just "merely good" ones. It's in chronologic order which is a plus for me. Most of the U.S. singles are included here, except the Beautiful Garbage ones. I too would have liked "Androgyny" and it seemed like on a local radio station that "Breaking Up the Girl" was a pretty well sized hit, but I guess with Shirley's dis-approval of the latter track and to include things on just one disc they decided to put in favor the bouncy "Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)" and the mostly spoken techno rock standard "Shut Your Mouth."The remix disc is a nice bonus and does not make a much higher price than the single disc version. Some of it is not interesting and I'm generally not a big remix fan but it can be an entertaining listen and is a nice bonus to the collection. About my only complaint is a re-recorded "It's All Over But the Crying," which was fine enough as it was seems like they just put louder percussion to make it more streamlined or something.If you're new to Garbage, this is a perfect start. And going from there, there's only four albums so it's not like you're putting much of a budget to throw on these CD's.

To tell you the truth, I also enjoy using Myspace a lot now. It took a long time for me to get used to it, because it seemed so scene-and-trend-based for awhile... Then I found some of my favorite artists on there and even got to hear unreleased songs and albums before they were out. This compilation is disappointing if you're looking for the unsigned/independent bands, but otherwise it is not really that bad. A natural problem, though, is that only the first two tracks are unreleased.The AFI song is pretty good, an outtake of "Sing the Sorrow" that would've fit on there okay. I wasn't a real big fan of the New Years Day song, however.... Then there's other songs which I already have a hold of that are decent, like the Weezer song. However, that's one of the weakest on "Make Believe" and is a bit silly. Against Me! are a nice contrast to the mix as well, acoustic-based punk done well. I'm not a big fan of AAR and Dashboard was too obvious of a choice, but both tracks are okay.A lot of these do fall in the emo/pop-punk territory, but what's disappointing is that it doesn't really use what's great about it. The Click Five can't write song lyrics to save their lyrics and when the vocals are that clear and the music isn't interesting enough, hearing those words annoys me. It's a little catchy though I admit, but that's not always a good thing. More of it is lackluster than anything else; hopefully subsequent compilations are more useful than this.I would give it 2.5, but because of AFI and sympathy, I'm rounding it up a half star.

Yes, there have been two singles collections from Mode out, and there is a single-disc version of this, without the music videos and the "short film" overview of DM. This is supposed to be a "best of," although that's what makes it a slight disapponitment: They had good enough album cuts to appear on the compilation. "One Caress," "Pimpf," "Here Is the House,": Now THAT is the best of DM of the past 25 years. The only track I really felt they could have left out was "See You." In spite showing that the band could have a hit without Vince Clarke and that they represent "A Broken Frame," I find that track bland, and it isn't the best-aged of DM's songs. It seems, in this respect, more like a "greatest hits" compilation, as none of the songs from "Black Celebration" were included, and those only got to the top 30 in the UK and did nothing in the US. Still, the other 17 make it worth it; even though I never got into "Shake the Disease," it's a fan favorite and deserves its place on here. That and the new "Martyr" are the only two tracks not to make a proper DM album ("STD" was single-only at the time). With the exception of four tracks on here (one new), everything else has been released on a Depeche Mode singles collection. It doesn't go in chronologic order like those two; it doesn't have to. Everyone needs some DM, so I don't mind this release. Warning to the new ones, though: You might get addicted & then buy everything with the band's name pretty much.Case in point: Last year, of the studio albums, I just had "Violator" and "Playing the Angel." I liked those two so much, I've ended up picking everything up, with the exception of 1983's "Construction Time Again" (which I may come around to getting).

I know, it seems a bit pretentious to give the clich&eacute; of, "if you like ____, you should check out (insert definitive band here). But I think anyone who is self-respecting and calls themselves an electronic fan NEEDS this. It is actually dangerously close to a five, and I'm sure if I heard it a little more it would get there. On top of being influential, the hooks are actually there. The first hit of theirs, "Autobahn," was edited for a single that was only a few minutes over the 20-minute album version. But here, you get a ten-minute version, which works really well. You can hear blueprints for EBM/industrial ("Music Non-Stop") and all types of electronic music, really. They talked of culture in technology and travel, the former which fits pretty well with the music. Of course, in distorted, robot-like voices. This group really DOES deserve the "ahead of their time" label. On top of influencing many sub-genres, it sounds like something that came out in the '90's. (Well, this compilation _is_ from 1991.) You can even hear where non-electronic bands like Coldplay get their ideas from. (Compare "Talk" fromX&Y;and "Computer Love"; that's an inevitable comparison).So if you want music that's innovative and fun to listen to, I recommend you some Kraftwerk. And seriously, it's not that easy to be THIS creative (or radically so in generally), yet they somehow have succeeded at such.

...is probably what this review will be. Yeah, everything you heard about the Pixies is pretty much true. The influence they've had is really undeniable, and personally, I feel that "Doolittle" just might be my very favorite Pixies album. I liked the first two albums a lot as well, but this one is the one where I can truly enjoy each track (maybe "blasphemous" for some, but I never liked "Broken Face"). True, it may not be the deepest lyrically but it does not suck in that department either. I don't like it when bands try to fake being profound in the first place, so this is nice. In fact I really love the lyrics about driving the car into the ocean on "Wave of Mutilation", which had a different version previously released as a B-side. Also, "Monkey" isn't a total obvious song but definitely has a message in it, and it's filled with the quirkiness you'll know and love in the Pixies. Also, the variety is just nice. Each track flows nicely together, and while it's a little bit different, my favorite is definitely western-like "Silver", with its eerie performance. Who says that drummers can't sing well? Well, Dave Lovering does just that on "La La Love You", although the lyrics are very simple, but due to that it's got a really great drum intro which follows the surf-style riff and the pop melody, it makes for a classic. It's kind of like "Here Comes Your Man", also on this record, with the catchy pop that is still never disposable.. And for people new to the band, this would be good to look into. There's also reggae rhythms in "Mr. Grieves", something that kind of makes it fun and a different pace. If you love Nirvana then you'll love "Gouge Away". The five-star average rating is more than justified. Start to beginning, "Doolittle" succeeds at being interesting, exciting, and pleasing for the ears, and what's even better, the record is timeless in sound. They were ahead of their time in the first place, so it's more amazing that this doesn't sound the least bit dated.

Technically, the Femmes' sixth studio album is no longer new in time, as it's reaching 13 years since its release. However, the SOUND is nothing like what you'll expect to hear. Think of the diversity of "Hallowed Ground" put with tunes that are ten times as bizarre. It's also a little bit less dark than that one. This is the result of guys who are trying something different and do well at it. My favorite track is "Amegmnon." I didn't find this record to be at all disappointing. It is interesting to hear the band use different tempos, styles, etc. There's also "Machine" which attempts a techno-industrial sound and with humorous results, "Mirror Mirror (I See a Damsel)" with completely un-contemporary arrangement. You may not like this record, but you won't find it boring. Unless you think that the artist should have distorted bass all the time, but why would you be here in the first place.I feel like this record does show the true Femmes as much as stuff like "Why Do Birds Sing?" The difference here is that they are highlighting their quirkiness, and I thought that was part of the charm of the first two albums. And they bring it back on here.

As a few others, I'm kind of new to much British hip-hop, but I feel that Dizzee Rascal did great with the first album. Several of the songs were entirely written by him, as he was also a producer of the album. Unlike so many other hip-hop albums I'm exposed to, there's no pointless talking or interlude tracks, which makes me happy. Also, the lyrics don't really make you roll your eyes. Most of it is done live, but I particularly love the sample of Billy Squire's "The Big Beat". To me, that on "Fix Up, Look Sharp" makes it one of the standouts on the album, as it actually puts a kind of funky feel to the track.There are quite a bit of hooks on it, despite the fact that it's quite original. There are a bit too many drum-'n-bass tracks, but that aside, it's a worthy record.

And I don't view that as any kind of a hyperbole. No matter how you put it, the Pumpkins stand out on their own. Once I was listening to some of the songs on the first Pumpkins show, and it seems like by the time that they released this that they were just releasing amazing stuff. As for the thing about them being the best Chicago band since Ministry, I almost completely agree. And while I love that band, I happen to think that these guys put Al Jourgensen to shame. That says a lot, doesn't it? Well, for one thing, that's just my opinion.A good thing about noting with this album is that most people seem to think that the band had two great recordings, "Siamese Dream" and "MCIS". Those are exceptional records that are actually a little bit better, but to me, not by much. If you like the hard-rock side of the Pumpkins than these three are a very good first buy ("Adore" if you like the more full-blown goth). This album has the psychedelia, metal, goth, and lots of other elements. After releasing singles from Limited Potential and Sub Pop, where do they go next? Instead of going for major label immediately, they went on Caroline. Also, if you found the lyrics on later works to be too self-obsessed (I really didn't), this is better for you because there aren't too many major themes on "Gish". It's a lot more of a humble record than it seems.It is also clear that you hear the sound of an actual band on this album that you don't hear quite as much on future SP albums. "I Am One" even has a bass solo from D'arcy! That song shows where the band was at this point and it was really a good sign of how they could jam out. If anyone wants to prove someone that all of the band members were really talented musically, this would be the track to do that with. The punch continues with "Siva", which has amazing guitar work of Billy and James. I like it when the song gets more clean and "dreamy" as well. It's like a taste of more greatness that was to come.Bass still shines in some of these songs that come later, too. A great example of this is "Rhinoceros", a good mix of new wave and hard rock that was kind of what the Pumpkins were. Once again, the guitar solo is amazing. Billy and James are such overlooked guitarists; nothing they do ever sucks. The vocals have some of my favorite melodies on Pumpkins tracks, as well. I like the way it fades out in the last thirty or so seconds, also.Other highlights appear. The ones that don't stand out as much are actually great but in the company that they are in get overshadowed, unfortunately. "Crush" is notable for its interesting playing and one interesting thing of note is that the percussive sound in the guitar solo is actually Billy's jewelry. I am glad that "Suffer" got re-tooled for the trip-hop world, and this is one of two moments where the gothic side of the Pumpkins really shines. You should also check out the great music ability that is shown on "Window Paine".In competition with the excellence of the first three tracks is probably "Daydream", where D'arcy shines on vocals, and there is some string in it. It's kind of like Cocteau Twins with less shoegaze, but don't worry because that sound is prevalent in most early Pumpkins work. It is backed by an alright hidden track, a performance of "I'm Going Crazy". A softer track and the only one on here where Billy spits out the f-bomb, it is nice to hear although it is not as great as the ten that are heard on here.And while it could be argued that this could be classified as grunge, the Pumpkins have always had more of a variety in their music than their contemporaries. It is not as boundary-pushing as "MCIS", as layered as "Siamese" or lush like "Adore" but it still sounds out. And "Machina" unfortunately doesn't have the competition that the other four records do (it's not bad, but it's spotty). While not my favorite debut record of all time (that nod goes to "Visual Audio Sensory Theater" by Vast), I still think this is something of exceptional quality. Very few records today even come close to matching this album.

Well, do you miss bands who used soft/loud dynamics, soundscapes through swirling guitars, and twisted through an ACTUAL unique sound? Silversun Pickpus are there for you, if that's what you are looking for. Yet at the same time, I don't know if it's the easiest "first listen" album. In fact, I was pretty underwhelmed when I first heard from them. I think it was the Smashing Pumpkins comparisons, and that's one of my all-time favorites. I wanted something similarly moving. It's not quite that way.But then again,Siamese DreamandAdoreare my two favorite albums by the group and the main template for the release. There's also a bit of a Modest Mouse sound. The group seems like they have quite a bit of potential. "Waste It On" has an awesome main bass riff. Oh, the lead singer doesn't really sound so much raspy, it's like the guy's got helium but he's not necessarily whining or making a Geddy Lee impression even. It's also not really a nasal mid-range often. They're the only group today who could call their success "trippy" and be precise. They came out of nowhere and are still on an independent label, and the mainstream picks them up like nothing else already. "Lazy Eye," the current single, isn't even one of the better songs on it. That one's okay, but I think it's the reason that I didn't care for the guys (and a girl) at first to begin with. Time will tell how this album and its hype turns out to be, but overall I'm satisfied and it's an overall pleasant listen. I can't complain; I got this for $7 after all. The low price and Smashing Pumpkins comparisons drew me in, as well as the single starting to grow on me.Definitely should be welcomed to fans of older alternative/indie who want something new to their collection. I can't wait to see what they do next. I imagine they're ready for something big in the future, but I just don't know if I should be holding my breath just yet.

As my title implies, that's what I feel. U2 in the '90s is kind of unnecessary to a certain extent for singles, but it's actually not as bad as it sings. You were probably always humming along to "Beautiful Day", "One", and "Mysterious Ways" in the first place. And the music itself is pretty decent overall of the collection. So, may I tell you what's wrong with it?The "new" mixes of the tracks are the biggest flaw. None do anything to enhance it, and in some cases they are actually sub-par. "Discotheque" is really kind of annoying on this new take, where the original was a great song. "Staring At the Sun" was one of the '90s U2 classics and is rather bland in this new take. "Numb" is decent but I'd rather stick with the original.... Also, the choices anyone? As far as I know, "Gone"'s remix was decent but the song had no business being on this compilation in any form. Neither did "The First Time" for that matter, a lesser song on the masterpiece "Zooropa". Then hits and fan favorites like "The Fly" are nowhere to be found, although they were singles. I can see why "Lemon" wasn't included though; that would sound out of place on this album.On the good side though, quite a bit of non-album U2 is represented. The William Orbit mix of "Electrical Storm" is amazing, one of my favorite U2 songs ever. It's a nice Britpop song. "The Hand That Built America" is decent as well, although not amazing. The other non-album tracks include the "Batman & Robin" hit "Hold Me...", which is one of the closest things to industrial that U2 did in that decade. Its edginess showed why U2 were so much more than a run-of-the-mill pop band they would've been had they gone from "Joshua" to "ATYCLB". A track they did in their Passengers moniker appears as well, "Miss Sarajevo", which is really quite interesting. In addition, it includes the three classics I mentioned in the first half, which don't require a description of the excellence.Without the flaws, this could have been a great retrospective of the second decade in U2's music. It was actually better in the 90s than the 80's in this person's humble opinion, but the compilation does not do anything to suggest that. Just take note of the stuff worth actually owning.

What can be said that the others haven't? They did a great job, but I'll repeat what they've said anyway: "Futureperfect" is just a beautiful album. The lyrics offer hope, and the instrumentals are nice enough additions to the mix. Yes, there's a few others who do the trance-y beats with the industrial sound (i.e. Funker Vogt at times), but nothing is quite like this one.It may take awhile for this record to sink in for some people, as most of these songs are 5-6 minutes long. But no moment is wasted here really. The first VNV song I heard was "Beloved" a few years back. I was taken aback on how incredible that song was. It's still my favorite VNV song and one of my all-time favorites.And that song is really not a fluke. There's the more space-y sounding songs like "Carbon" and the album speaks of its futurism without having to do with the current political climate. Ronan Harris is one of the greatest song writers of the industrial scene. Most people expect the abrasion of Skinny Puppy and Ministry when they hear the term "industrial," but this record is a different kind of horse. Where some of those artists have silly lyrics about being empty, this album never resorts to that. Ronan doesn't have a wide range in vocals but the passion can be heard and for me, that's what matters more anyway. More hopeful lyrics abound and we get other gems like "Genesis."I guess what helps for me is both the music and the lyrics. Sometimes when I'm worried and/or overly anxious, this album helps me calm down, no matter how cheesy that actually sounds. Most fans seem to viewEmpiresas the finest hour, and while that one's pretty good, I feel like this album has that one eclipsed. This fourth LP from a fantastic "futurepop" group deserves a place in your collection, if you like electronic and industrial music.

So, there are three Clash albums that I own, and of the three, I find that "Combat Rock" is the weakest of those. However,The ClashandLondon Callingare incredible albums. The former is a straight-up punk assault done brilliantly, and the latter is their experimentation pretty much all gone right. The band's fifth album was where the band members started being more conflicted, and this may not be too surprising when listening to this album.There are of course some definite highlights. Everyone knows the classics "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" and the even better "Rock the Casbah." These tracks are some of the most catchy on the album and have riffs that will be stuck in your head for awhile. There are a couple of other songs worthy of listening to on the record. "Know Your Rights" couldn't have possibly have been a better opener. With the opening lyrics of "This is a public service announcement/with guitars," it sounds like a beginning track of an album, and is a moving listen. The track has the band's political views and with some sarcasm and wit. Then there's the awesome funk of "Overpowered by Funk." I think if someone enjoyed Mick Jones' future project, Big Audio Dynamite, this album might actually be a pretty good introduction.The rest? It's a bit interesting, but not anything special. There is spoken poetry and attempts at being over the map musically once again, only this time they don't sound as into the experiments as they once were. That kind of makes it disappointing. That being said, "Combat Rock" isn't too bad of an album, and the weaker portion is actually kind of forgettable by comparison to the stronger.The album is not bad, and it's quite cheap actually, so it wouldn't be bad to try looking out for this one, even if I don't recommend it as your first step into the Clash's backcatalogue. It may be easier to listen to in snippets than in full, actually.

I'm sorry to say the last part but that is what I honestly feel. Maybe the audience of this album isn't necessarily for someone like me. I like songs that can be "more quiet" as well (look at my review for "Adore" by the Smashing Pumpkins). It just seems to me like what is done here is just kind of, well, average. That's not to say that there aren't moments I like listening to on "Morning View", there are. I mean, I think it's pretty good, but it doesn't leave much playback value or aftertaste.Songs that I particularly enjoy the whole way through include the excellent single "Warning" which should pretty much be heard by EVERYONE. I like the progression of the chords on the outro in particular. The message is good and turns out to be unpretentious. I enjoy other tracks, but not nearly to that extent. It seems that the really good tracks don't come until late in the album. For instance, it ends well with "Aqueous Transmission" which is unique for bands that they are compared to. I like the somewhat stream-of-consciousness lyrics as well. There are a lot of times here though that I respect the ideas a lot more than I actually enjoy the record.This reminds me of listening to "Good News..." by Modest Mouse in that both records, while praised among new fans, don't really do a whole lot for me. I don't think that this is bad at all, but it seems like a lot of other bands do similar ideas and pull it off in a more convincing way. And yes, to me, 3 stars is actually a favorable opinion.

Probably one of the most derided bands of the grunge era was Stone Temple Pilots. That didn't mean they did not have good songs and this shows that the critics will sometimes deride anything with the slightest possibility of being successful. Arguably they have done better (the follow-up "Purple") and the other four records are more diverse, but this still gets things going strong.People compare the group to Pearl Jam, but I'd say this record is far more Alice in Chains. A lot of the songs are still played to death on rock radio, but here you also get pretty good songs like "Piece of Pie" that the radio doesn't really touch. The pace is changed a bit on other songs, and although most songs here run past five minutes, none of them seem self-indulgent or unnecessary. Still, "Plush," "Wicked Garden," and "Creep" were meant to be hits and they are still catchy. The masses are still enjoying it for a good reason: It rocks like it should. Emotion is there. A couple songs change the overall pace here, including the ender, "Where the River Goes." That one goes on just a little bit too long and "Crackerman" comes off as a sophomoric "Sex Type Thing" and I'm not too big on "Sin," but the rest is quite good. Recommended.

If you ever heard an album from VAST, you know exactally why they're/he's so great. It's like NIN, but then not at all. It's equally as beautiful as NIN's Fragile album, but less dark and more like chillout stuff. Monks are sampled much less here than on the debut, and the orchestra is more like what it was replaced for.VAST's albums are so different, it's not even that easy to tell that both are the same. Either way, this one's pretty unique itself, as &quot;Free&quot; is the only thing that's any heavier than the debut, and &quot;My TV and You&quot; is the only real industrial song.Chants appear everywhere on the debut, but this time, it's left to only two tracks: &quot;What Else Do I Need?&quot; and the excellent &quot;A Song Without A Name&quot;. It isn't really gothic despite a high Cure influence and is more of a melodic album, doesn't sound so much like Sisters of Mercy.However, I think that everyone should own it. This music deserves to be heading on the music charts, and I think that they rival Queens of the Stone Age at times, and that's saying something. Inspired stuff, I swear. I think that someday VAST's word-of-mouth name will get him high album sales, though it really hasn't mattered recently.&quot;Free&quot; got me into this CD, as the album DID need a rocker. When I heard it on the radio, I loved the lyrics and I'd keep an interest with VAST.Crosby is also very good on &quot;The Gates of Rock 'N Roll&quot;, a song that has this interesting beat to it, and the bass lines sort of represent The The. The melody and guitars are what rock most.Don't believe it's beautiful? Listen to &quot;Lady of Dreams&quot;, the instrumental. I just love listening to that every day before I go to sleep. As well as the album, and I've just really been blown away by VAST... This is poetry, and music for people is an appropiate title if you've heard anyting by VAST before.

When you listen to this album, it's just so hard to believe this is the same group who gave usThe Score. That record was brilliant and is still one of my top five hip-hop albums that I own. Where that one had them showing a bigger range of songs and had social commentary-style lyrics, this is them making a totally different record, like it's another group maybe. Almost everything here is strictly hip-hop influenced, and of the early-'90's variety.I would argue that this is not really that classic though, unlike aforementioned album. It's just hard to believe that this group is trying to pose as thugs here, although they hadn't yet gotten to where they later went, so maybe that's forgiveable. At 18 tracks, there's quite a bit of "interludes," although "Blunted Interlude" works more as a full song than an actual interlude. And it's one of the better tracks on here. There are hints of what to come, but it's not THAT obvious. "Vocab" has some acoustic guitar that we'd later hear from Wyclef, especially solo. "Some Seek Stardom" which is mostly Lauryn Hill, was the closest thing to a taste of what was to come. It's about the only song we get to hear her SING on. That one is one of the few with a message, one about knowing where you come from.Overall, it's actually good, but just don't expect it to be overall AMAZING like what you had come to know. It's pretty cheap though, and I got mine for a nice used price. It's worth hearing at least a few times; just don't expect it to be quite as varied and groundbreaking.

'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness' was probably the most influential double album of the 90s, and arguably moreso than Pink Floyd's Wall album or the Beatles' White album (neither those artists greatest). And although I prefer NIN's Fragile album, this is more diverse and eclectic.I was first exposed to the entire album nearly three years ago, and I kept listening because every track stood out so much to me.The band's first two studio albums, Gish and Siamese Dream showed the band's ability to have many midtempos and a solid mix of soft and more rocky songs on their discs. On this album, there are several hits, yet it's also an album needed to be heard with an open ear, but surpringly, many people have caught up to opening their minds on this one. And even though Billy isn't the greatest singer to everyone, I like his vocals because they never fail to show the emotion intended in the albums.The singles aged well, also. "Tonight Tonight" has some of Billy's best lyrics ever, and is a good way to build an album up from an awesome piano instrumental. It's got many strong things in it. As well as the fact that "Zero" has the craziest guitar solo ever, even though I don't care as much for the lyrics admittedly. As well as the fact that "Bullet With Butterfly Wings" is instantly catchy and everyone knows the chorus. "Thirty Three" kind of reminds me of "Disarm", but it's distinct enough from that one to where it stands out on its own, and I still love it. As well as the fact that it has their biggest hit ever, "1979", with a bit of a new wave influence, as that one also had well-done lyrics and some memorable bass from D'arcy. One thing I remember about the time when I was 8/9 years old and this album came out was the music videos, all which were experiences. MTV actually played music videos then, and Smashing Pumpkins vids for that matter.The band's electronic side even slightly comes in on this album. That's how much it's got in it. Songs like "Love" and "We Only Come Out At Night" have elements of that, although the latter is more of its own style.Some songs, I feel, are as long as they should have been. "Thru The Eyes of Ruby" is just amazing, so that song's placement is very valid. "X.Y.U." is just explosive, one of the album's heaviest, with an amazing guitar solo, and some of Corgan's most memorable yells in music.As well as the fact that there are other ways to describe tracks unlisted. There is cool guitar on "Farewell and Goodnight" that stands out,Jimmy Chamberlain's drum talent still shines through, whether it be the memorable cymbals of "Lily" or in many other tracks on the album. I was shocked that I liked the follow-up album which lacked his drumming.So all in all, this album has almost everything. Music has influences that range from heavy rock to even classical and jazz influences, as shown in the title track.This was their most diverse album ever made, so if you look in that for an album, pick this up first from the band. However, I prefer 'Adore' and 'Siamese Dream' to this, but it's still excellent, and that's not by much that I prefer the two. I wonder how you wouldn't own this in the first place, but it's a double album, so I guess that's why. So I guess, if you see it used and have the money for a full album and wouldn't be willing to spend 25 dollars, buy this used.

And actually, the only reason I think I gave it a four instead of a five is that I prefer the three predecessor albums, which I feel were the masterpieces. But make no mistake, "Midnite Vultures" is just as good of an album. While it was intended that way, it does seem like more of a party album for Beck than any of his other releases. Besides, I love listening to tracks where the lyrics just make me smile, and that happens a lot on here. The themes on sex are really tongue-in-cheek and possibly more relevant today than the seven years ago when it was recorded. Also beware, this is like the polar opposite of "Mutations."A lot of Beck fans hate the song, but "Hollywood Freaks" is a personal favorite of mine. Especially on the bridge when he shouts "Jockin' my Mercedes/Probably have my baby/Shop at Old Navy/He wish I was a lady", I still crack up even after the several listens to the song, a slap in the face kind of lyric to the ridiculous scene of gangsta at the time. This is just one of many examples of the genius of "Midnite Vultures." The tracks are very ranged; perhaps too much for some listeners. However, the overall feel being similar may also turn some off.There's also the interesting electro "Get Real Paid", which has Beth Orton (good match for a song). Other than "HF", my favorite is probably the catchy single "Mixed Bizness." The album doesn't do much to settle down until the end of the album on "Debra", which has a standout falsetto from Beck.Besides, if you like to laugh at oversexed pop culture and have lots of fun, "Midnite Vultures" is a perfect album for you. Definitely an enthralling listen.

STP have always been a band that music snobs hated, just for being themselves. They started out with the straight-ahead hard rock of the debut "Core", then got even more commercial success with the excellent "Purple". Then, they got this, which while maybe not as good as those two definitely has the most variety in an STP album. Some people claim to hate it, and admittedly, I can sort of see why. Brendan O'Brien is a pretty hit-or-miss producer, and the production is kind of shoddy on this album, unfortunately. That doesn't mean it doesn't contain some of the band's greatest work.And in fact it does. "Adhesive" is worth buying this album for like $12 alone. The closest thing to a jazz song you'll ever hear from STP members, it's also a great sort of downbeat track in the verses, but I like the reflection in the lyrics. In a time where grunge had recently died and more importantly people were still lamenting Cobain's death, there's the "sell more records if I'm dead" line that I like quite a bit. The track builds up as it goes by. The trumpet solo is my favorite thing about it.And then there are the singles which in themselves they are pretty good. "Trippin'" is the most famous one, and while not representative of STP's trademark style, it is excellent, complete with its jazz-influenced guitar solo. "Big Bang Baby" has a clear Rolling Stones "Jumpin' Jack Flash" influence, but this is a lot closer to what that band could have been doing at the time instead. "Lady Picture Show" is a decent song and then there's "Tumble in the Rough" which is just simple and fun. Not necessarily perfect songs, but very good ones in spite that.The two instrumental tracks I enjoy a lot here too. There's the excellent somewhat funk style of "Press Play" which will make you do just that. Also great is the Dean DeLeo track "Daisy", which is proof that even if you hated STP, you have to give them credit for the talent. Elsewhere, there are other nice-enough tracks.But then there are songs on this album which I simply don't care for. "Pop's Love Suicide" is a rather blahh track, and I guess it either feels too retro for me or something. I also don't really care for "Ride the Clich&eacute;" which kind of seems directionless on an otherwise great album.So yes, there is its fair share of filler. But any of that can be forgiven with the greatest STP song ever, "Adhesive". I don't think I like this album as much as "Purple" but that one is great too. While some call it a Beatles ripoff, I don't think that it is really fair. STP have the passion of the song to make it their own stuff. And contrary to what others will tell you, I think every STP album is good.

After recording such masterpieces such as "The Bends", "OK Computer", and "Kid A", I was kind of wondering if Radiohead would "do it again". While that didn't happen either of the future times, this record does sometimes get played by me and is a competent album. It borrows from elements of other albums but to be made into the songs that they become. It's sometimes seen as the sequel to "OK" but keep in mind that that one is a much better album. It doesn't mean you won't enjoy this album, although I didn't find it perfect at all.The highpoints are the very good though. "2 + 2 = 5" starts out in classic Radiohead fashion with its verses, it gets kind of in a dark melody, but then he finally speaks up, with the "you have not been paying attention!" part, and it just keeps getting better from there. I also love the bridge part. It could have been longer but is fine how it is. "Sail to the Moon" is a really melodious song, which is kind of a laid back Radiohead song. Then there's "Where I End and You Begin" which U2 have been afraid to make in the decade, but that's okay because Radiohead seem more expert at mixing electronica and rock, complete with a cool guitar solo even if it sounds more like "Achtung Baby" than Radiohead. But Thom's vocals is where the track differs from that. "There, There" is classic Radiohead, partially from genious instrumentation of Johnny Greenwood. "I Will" is a great track which is mostly vocal-based. I usually don't like those type of songs, but it was well done here, kind of like a simple lullaby or something. Nice, clean guitar. Then there's the great mix of electroclash and rock on the classic "Myxamotosis" which pretty much makes this record worth owning alone. His voice isn't as whiny here as on other tracks. Plenty of others are worth listening to even if not a description.Then, there's still a downside. For one thing, the tracklisting seems a bit off. To me, sandwiching "Backdrifts" between "Sail to the Moon" and "Go to Sleep" makes the thing sound really haphazardous. In addition, some of these songs should have been left as b-sides. There is the directionless "Sit Down. Stand Up" which also doesn't make any sense. I've tried getting into it, but unsuccesfully. Then there's "We Suck Young Blood" which Thom's voice really annoys me on. Usually I don't mind his voice but this time the vocals are so discombobulated it could be nails on a chalkboard. I will admit that the piano solo is really cool though.Overall, I think if you are a big Radiohead fan then you should check this out. It is not as consistent as other albums, but isn't as much of a throwback as you'd expect. It is probably darker than those albums although at some points more melodic. I can't tell you that it's perfect but there's enough quality on here to enjoy it in the sum of its parts.

Depending on who you are, the first two DM records may be viewed as some kind of false start for the synth-pop group. This is not really my favorite album by the group at all, but stands as a worthy inclusion of the album. I actually like most DM albums over this, but there is stuff that brings it together.It's still kind of minimalist, but here the song-writing has improved. It's like a distant cousin toSome Great Reward, less developed and not quite as consistently good, but it's not really a bad album. It takes a little bit to get into, since apart from the singles, it's kind of indistinguishable. I'd probably give it three stars if not for "Love, In Itself" and "Everything Counts," which still stand up as Depeche classics. The former is kind of quirky in its construction but shows the band's expermentation into acoustic guitars and piano samples here and there. I like Gore's simple lyrics here. Where onA Broken Framehe seemed like he wanted to prove that Depeche could continue as the band they were, that was kind of the transistion from the beginning to here. The record in retrospect is kind of underproduced; you have to turn the volume up pretty high to hear the songs in even the sound they are onThe Singles 81>85. In this case I may recommend you get theremastered versionof the group's third LP (now, if only they'd make a standard version). There's also more Alan Wilder-penned tracks here than on any other Depeche Mode album, even if it's merely two songs.If you're new to DM, I suggest you trying one of their other albums first, but if you love what you've heard from them, particularly "Some Great Reward," I think that this would be worth checking out. Besides, it's fairly cheap as it is.

This album seems like an album people both love and hate. For me, I am closer to the love side, but then again, it's DM, and some of these tracks make the album more than worth owning. Martin sometimes sings on some of the weaker tracks, but not on this album. His two tracks are some of the strongest on the album. The only thing that brings the album down a little bit is that the instrumentals don't really do much, even the closing (unlisted) "Junior Painkiller." It has my favorite DM song, "Freestate," which has this kind of worldly and trippy feel, and shows a great maturity of the band. I think I prefer "Violator" and "Songs of Faith and Devotion", but as it stands, those are my two favorite DM albums (but I also like a few others more). While it may not have the kind of lively energy that made everything from "Black Celebration" to "Songs" great, it works perfectly fine on this record. Some mourn the loss of Alan, but for me, this group never put anything bad, and while I feel he is what turned DM into a great band, I wouldn't disregard everything else in particular. Totally worth a listen.

Okay, that's a stretch, I guess. However, I must say one thing: I am not a big fan of the genre. I usually find that excess ruins bands like Dream Theater, and that talent shouldn't be an excuse to make tracks full of musical wanking. Also, prog-rock fans tend to irritate me with their genearlization of music as simple=bad, complex=good, and an overall holier-than-thou attitude. I'll tell you what's good about Porcupine Tree and "In Absentia": None of the moments here are wasted or seem overly self-indulgent. Also, they don't pretentiously try showing you how individually talented they are; you can just hear that by listening to the songs. The group shouldn't even be pigeonholed into a genre. Simply, they are Porcupine Tree. There are elements of alternative rock, heavy metal, and some atmospheric electronics occasionally thrown in the mix.Also, other good things about Porcupine Tree is rather than having a silly, melodramatic vocalist, Steven Wilson does not have to show you his range and sounds great through this whole record. The tracks actually are focused on songwriting, melody, and have hooks. It's not just that: Songs like "Trains" and "Prodigal" are just amazing, and the album never lets down from its greatness (check out the final two tracks, "Strip the Soul" and "Collapse the Light Into Earth"). Also, the fact that the concept is used as a backbone rather than a theme is great and can actually be taken seriously. Even tracks like the instrumental "Wedding Nails" or the eight-minute "Gravity Eyelids" show some quality and don't seem overdone in any way. Also, in some tracks, the bass sounds very good, not the type used with too much distortion and yet it's loud enough in the mix to stand out, like in "The Creator Has a Mastertape."It's a wonder that something this good has virtually no success. Not everything on a major label is garbage and this is proof. A friend of me got me into Porcupine Tree with a mix tape of their songs, and I found that many of my favorites were on "In Absentia," so I recently purchased that one. Soon enough I'll be trying to catch up by getting "Stupid Dream" and "Deadwing." These tracks are all worth repeating and I can tell you I will not stop with this PT album.

Okay, so when I heardEmploymentI was hooked from the very first listen. This record has some of its qualities but what got me into it was the urgency and its resonated energy from beginning to end. It's an excellent debut record and one of the finest releases of its respective year.This on the other hand is sadly pretty mediocre. It isn't that bad, but the energy seems kind of tired by comparison. I usually try not to jump on the sophomore slump bandwagon, and in fact I'll give them antoher chance. To see that I don't view them as a one-album wonder like on this what made me skeptical. Sometimes the songs are actually decent but not that fun to listen to. And that's what matters to me. "Ruby" is great and there's some other good moments like "Heat Dies Down" but for the most part you can't help but feel they could have put more life into this record.Definitely not one of my favorites this year but nothing too terrible.

With many things, particularly an image on the back cover that can imply "career suicide", Eminem has come to release his fourth studio album (not including the two D12 albums and '8 Mile' soundtrack). Not particularly his best work, but it still has its moments. There are certain moments of the album that I do enjoy. Eminem will always have an impression on someone; that's why he is always discussed about among the people. If he didn't matter, we wouldn't. But obviously what is great about him goes far beyond the controversy. He's got quite a bit of creativity/ideas, although on this album it seems as if it's good if he takes some time away from the studio.But while the first three albums were all pretty good, this is where things go down a little bit. The best moments aren't really "classics" or anything. However, the highpoint of the album is the title track which features 50 Cent and Dr. Dre. This track may be the sole exception to that rule as it has some nice beats and the rhymes are decent. There's "Mosh" which has Em being more political than ever, even if it was a clich&eacute; during its time. While "Like Toy Soldiers" and "Mockingbird" are both decent, they were obviously lifted whereas it wasn't to this extent in previous times. "Evil Deeds" is something that would satisfy the longtime fan.The disappointing thing is that the "funny" stuff has never seemed this juvenile. Just look at the single "Ass Like That" in its triteness, or "Puke" which is plain silly. I guess that five years doesn't really change people that much, does it?... then tehre's "Just Lose It" which is the same thing he does every time he promotes his albums. Can't he use a different strategy for once? Maybe this is why it's said that he may not be releasing albums anymore. The fact that there are so many songs like this makes it a dissapointment when considering he had some great stuff, especially on his last two albums. None of them would be 5 stars in my eyes, but the predecessors are definitely better.If you are a casual fan I would not start things out this way although it isn't really as bad as others would have you believe it is. This record is barely something I recommend yet the fact that it is at all at least makes it worthy of a few listens.

Yes, you read right. Following "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness", the Smashing Pumpkins had a lot of ups and downs. Following Jimmy Chamberlin's addiction which got him temporarily kicked out of the Pumpkins, they didn't know how they continue, but in the end did just that. It is true that Chamberlin does not appear on here and that he is an amazing drummer, but what's done here is what to accept. And it's really, really good. Did you like the two songs from "Batman & Robin" and "Eye" from "Lost Highway"? Well, then you will probably really like this album. It's not really as quiet as others would have you think.And I think today that some of the people who originally loathed this album laugh now at their sentiments, because if you're not used to what's here, you're just going to have to wait to let it sink in. And it's 100% worth it. People who like music done by people who like doing music like the Smashing Pumpkins. And I think Billy's voice sounds great here.It starts very nicely with the acoustic fingerpick "To Sheila", which also has this nice percussive atmosphere in the verses. The melody is just really, really good. The track is a little bit less than five minutes yet the point is well done. The bridge is just perfect (no pun intended). Then things go into an actual rocking track, "Ava Adore". Nice instrumentation, and the only song with an actual guitar solo here. More guitar was actually done live, but on here it just sounds really cool. The gothic influence is not only shown in the music video but on this album, partially with this particular song. It's still more of a heavy trip-hop track. It's a wonder it wasn't bigger than it was. Then you get things in the pop territory a la "1979" with "Perfect". However, this one's about ups and downs where the other one was just carefree and this one's also probably a lot more new wave. It is also a nice balance of electronica and rock, as is the next song, "Daphne Descends", which is notable for its bridge.That's not even close to the end of the excitement on "Adore". You get a nice acoustic tribute to Billy's deceased grandma on "Once Upon a Time", which is more acoustic than many probably expected. Then comes in "Tear", which has orchestration via keyboards, done really well. The melody is great even though the programming is a bit hard to handle in the first couple listens, which is pretty much the meat and bones of the verses. But it gets better with time. I think it may be one of the greatest Pumpkins songs made, and that's saying a lot."Crestfallen" is a Depeche Mode type piano pop song, then it follows to the electronica of that band and New Order's style in "Appels + Oranjes". I think I read that the misspelling was so people wouldn't think it was a Pink Floyd cover. But it's the only song here that fully embraces the electronica, so if you're expecting that, just listen to this. I liked it so much it inspired the screen name I have on AOL. "Pug" is a really unique track, and I don't know anything else to say about that one.Then comes a couple of stream-of-consciousness tracks of great Billy Corgan poetry; the former is a lesser track while the latter is a nice piano track which was unchanged from its demo. About the only problem on the album is that "Shame" is a bit long, but it's still a pretty good song. The guitar part is pretty repetitive though. You do get to hear some bass playing from D'arcy, though.Then you get into a trilogy of pure greatness. "Behold! The Night Mare" has some distortion but in more of a nighttime/goth type of way. It is great for if you like goth. Also, a quite unique track on the album. It gets a bit interesting in its atmospheres and also when it just goes on the simple playing in the bridge. Following that is "For Martha" which is over eight minutes, a great tribute to Billy's mom. It's very peaceful in its piano and the chorus is just plain magical. This one is the length it is for a reason. Then it's the full-on piano ballad, "Blank Page". The piano could've maybe been written a little bit better, but it is still a pretty good song. I really like Billy's melody in this track. It may be hard to believe for some, but Billy's voice and the piano together sound really good.It isn't just for "hardcore fans". While some may argue that I'm one, I didn't exactly say that "Machina" was pristine in quality. It's also for goths and people who would prefer the Pumpkins doing more "quiet" tracks. But it's really not that quiet, save for a few moments in the album. But it is unmistakably a Pumpkins record. Billy still has a lot of ambition and fuel in him on here. It also was a matured point from some of what was on the previous records. Play this album in the autumn and you'll feel like it's the soundtrack to that particular time.

2005 saw System of a Down release two albums in the year, the second one which connects the liner notes to the first. I've been a SOAD fan for a few years now. I had huge expectations for hearing new SOAD since I loved "Toxicity" so much, and got around to buying the other albums by then. I was totally blown away by "Mezmerize," and I know it's an unpopular opinion, but to me, that's the best work they've done. Every song on there is wonderful, and while it may not have been too serious, it was kind of refreshing to hear, and only two songs were actually political.Here comes the sequel to that one, "Hypnotize." In my opinion, the other album was a lot more moving, but this one isn't too bad. The hits "Hypnotize" and "Lonely Day" are okay, but for me, they are not what SOAD are best at. The former is well-performed but to me seems like it was kind of written to be a hit more than connect with the band's artistry. The latter has some of the band's weakest lyrics, never getting in depth on what makes the day so depressing/lonely. A tale of a prostitute and drag queen on "She's Like Heroin" is okay, but that's not really one of my favorite songs from the group, either.This album is far more political than "Mezmerize," but many of the songs deal with the Armenian genocide issues. The greatest songs, for me, don't match with the other disc, but it is still pretty good. Not as quick and quirky as the predecessor, but songs like "Stealing Society" and "Vicinity of Obscenity" show the group has plenty of creativity in them and are totally exciting to hear. It is also a more bleak album than the past one, speaking of some hopelessness in "Tentative," "Holy Mountains," and "Soldier Side." That being said, all of those are great songs. While not as speedy as its counterpart, it still has edginess in the majority of the album. Like everything SOAD, not everyone will connect with it as it is an acquired taste.As for lumping the guys with n&uuml;-metal: They transcend the sub-genre. They play faster than most of the mid-tempo groups and also unlike those, they change the tempos more often and have loads of creativity. It's not just teenage angst. "Hypnotize" is definitely a worthy listen and worth adding to your musical collection. Even when SOAD don't make completely amazing music for me, it is still excellent.

While I enjoyed everything I knew from the Cure thoroughly, this DVD really put them higher as far as my respect for them than ever before. Part of the greatness is in that these already-wonderful tracks are put in the DVD, especially how they performed three albums in entirety, and what's even better is the other stuff, like the explaining of what they did. Also, the encore gave me a better appreciation for those two songs than ever before.This is especially great if you like the theme of the albums. Each of these are done greatly. While The Cure was just a trio in the 'Pornography' era, there is more emphasis with more musicians in this rendition, full of nothing but strongpoints. I especially liked the performances of "One Hundred Years" and "The Hanging Garden".The longest and the best is the 'Disintegration' set, which is done a bit different. I love the way that "Lullaby" is performed (in part to bassist Simon Gallup) and especially what's done in the first minute of "Pictures of You", one of my all-time favorite songs. "Love Song" has a nice guitar solo added as well as having more emphasis of keyboard than the album version. Which is good with me, since to me I feel that the keyboards make the song. He adds some German lingo in at the end of the already-wonderful "Fascination Street", particularly because it's the Berlin show of the trilogy.The 'Bloodflowers' material is done well too, with super long songs that were in the set to begin with. I always loved "Watching Me Fall" so it was nice to see that one done. And Robert does use the 12-string on that track. Many other great things.To me, this shines in two moments: Both 'Kiss Me' tracks, "If Only Tonight We Could Sleep" and "The Kiss". Seeing this DVD and being a guitar player, the Cure have given me a lot of ideas on that since this. Especially the former, with a classical/gothic style in its first two minutes. As well as Robert's guitar playing, with that cool scratching/sliding. "The Kiss" is a nice, agressive song and has the energy done right.In the extras is mainly the inspiration of why they came up with the trilogy idea, if that's the end, and what the direction of the Cure's future would be. While some of that seems to be answered, it's nice seeing what they say on this.I don't know how a Cure fan could not want this, as it's something to be proud of. It transformed me from thinking that they were great legends to a band that will always matter to me because of good talent and guitar.

Although I liked Orgy's debut album, "[...]--," that one had some kind of cheesy lyrics, and I felt that the whole last fourth of the album could've been taken off, as those came off as fillers for me. On here, the song-writing's better and they do not try to come off as empty sounding this time around. The production is just as good as it was last time. It is also the more melodic of the two.My two favorite tracks from this album are "Fiction (Dreams in Digital)" and "Eva." Both songs, simply, are perfect. The former was particularly recorded in a stellar way, and gets better each time. The latter is a great emotional track of the album, and Orgy have never sounded so human before. Another really great one is "Suckerface" which has some anthemic synths and a catchy chorus. Just about every song here is pretty good. This is by far my favorite Orgy album. Although this too goes on for a bit longer than it needs to, it is nearly a flawless record from them. This is not a sophomore slump, but what a group's second album should be mroe like. More tight songwriting, more maturity, less of the trickery.Buy this ANY day before the disastrous blunder "Punk Statik Paranoia."

I have been a follower of Modest Mouse from a relatively newer time, actually. When they were releasing their Up albums, I knew little about music and only listened to what the mainstream played. But during the time of 'The Moon & Antarctica' was when I finally got into the band, and I found the album to be heartfelt, exciting, and worthy of repeat listens. Then later I finally got to hear older stuff which was also great.This is pretty good, too. While the interludes entertain there really isn't much special about them. "The Horn Intro" is just that, "Dig Your Grave" was an interesting ukelele track if unneccessary, and I sort of enjoy listening to "Interlude (Milo)". However, what stands out more are the "real" songs.They have influence of that, too, such as in the entertaining "The Devil's Workday", although that song is not really special. What is great about it is from the beginning, with songs like the slow-burning "World At Large", moving single "Float On", and the afterlife-questioning brilliance of "Ocean Breathes Salty". Isaac Brock's beliefs sometimes seem a bit ridiculous to me although there is some down-to-earth feeling of the album.To me, though, the centerpiece of the album is "Bury Me With It", complete with slacker-style rants and a loud chorus. I even titled this review after that because the line is so memorable. While the verses have a near-rap and he kind of yells the chorus, it gets really melodic in its bridge.Other highlights are the Clash-like punk of "Black Cadillacs", the meaningful "One Chance" and the realization of drugs doing bad for you on "The Good Times Are Killing Me".There are a lot of songs which are a taste that I still have yet to acquire. "Dance Hall" is too chaotic for even my tastes and I don't get why the same people who dissed Trent Reznor for his pessimistic views go and praise stuff like "Bukowski", although I like how they referenced the poet/author. It doesn't seem worthy of repeat listens to me though. There wasn't a "lovely" view on lyrics like "What People Are Made Of" from 'The Moon & Antarctica', either, though. Then there are songs like "Satin in a Coffin" which are too banjo-based for my liking and I never could stomach "Blame It on the Tetons", even though Isaac Brock's vocals are fine enough there. There's something about the instrumentation I dislike so much, particularly the fiddles. And this is coming from someone who loved "Jesus Christ Was an Only Child" from 'The Lonesome Crowded West'. It's just a bit, uh, dreary for my tastes.I prefer the older MM records by far, but if you can get yourself acquired to the taste needed for this album then it will be more of a welcome for you. I prefer the tracks with Sonic Youth-like distortion and slacker type rants most of the time which was the case of this album. Usually when I don't like something it's not for these reasons but it was a bit challenging for my tastes. I wonder what they will offer in the future.

Okay, I'm glad people got the mp3 thing taken care of: These are CD quality songs that were mastered from mp3's. Also, you can still get both "Turquoise" and "Crimson" albums online to compare if you also buy the record. Beyond that, 2 CD's for under $15 is a bargain, no matter what the case is. These tracks are worth listening to."Nude" is one of my top-five favorite albums of all-time and I knew I'd get this if it had a commercial release. They are different versions of the songs than on that album, "Desert Garden" being one of particular note. This one has a better recording quality and is overall better than the "Nude" version. I also like the fully mastered version of "(I Can't Say No) To You," the acoustic guitars really stand out on there. I think "Japanese Fantasy" was much better on "Nude," it's got a stronger chorus than on this album's "All I Found Is You."But the real treasure of this albums is what's NOT on "Nude": There's two "Turquoise" songs, "Falling from the Sky" and "I Woke Up L.A.," which were pretty good even without the album's inclusion. "Dead Angels" is new even for the ones who heard the mp3's. A great, mature acoustic track with some nice Crosby vocals. Quite a beautiful track. If you like the standard VAST fare, you'll love "That's My Boy," the briefly political track and then the brilliance doesn't even stop on there. "Se&ntilde;orita" has this cool horror-movie like string part that makes it addictive, and it's totally unlike everything I've heard. I just can't get enough of VAST; if it were an inferior artist then I'd give it 5 stars, but I don't want to look too much like an Ivy League professor, so I'm giving four this time. I recommend it to anyone who loves "Nude," and for those who haven't heard it, anyone interested in Jon Crosby's unique style.

If you thought "Sing the Sorrow" was a bad sell-out album, I advise you avoid this album too. AFI could care less about punk cred, and for that I totally respect them. Some of its detractors don't even know how long the band's been around really anyway. But that point aside, I really do enjoy "Decemberunderground". It's got some elements of the current industrial/"futurepop" music a la VNV Nation, De/Vision, etc., as well as the trademark AFI songs. I like the tracks where Davey Havok screams through them, it adds hardcore intensity to a few tracks, and was one of the band's strengths. If you like the goth side of AFI, you'll love this album.The lead single "Miss Murder" has some Green Day bass with a bunch of hooks, and an addictive bridge. The intro track is really interesting as well. There's intensity of "Affliction" and "Kill Caustic" that totally pulls me in for listening. Almost everything here is a winner. I have to say that Havok is still a great vocalist, and that musically this is some of their best stuff, getting more deep than previously.My only complaints about "Decemberunderground" are that the song "Summer Shudder" sounds like Hawthorne Heights with an added futurepop influence and they seem to be the type who thinks singing about death/suicide is "deep" and "artistic". However, the good things about the album far outweigh these and "Decemberunderground" is one of the greatest albums I've heard of 2006.

It seems that a common belief to many is that most "indie" music is esoteric and hard to get into, especially if it is rooted in experimentation. But in the case of TVOTR's second LP, I'd say that it shows that bands could play the style and make it very commercial but not in a way that overshadows its creativity. It's already been well established that they aren't your average Joes, but on this release the band's ideas seem more fruitful and realized than previous.This is living proof that even on a major label, they have incredible music. A lot of my favorites tend to be the ones that lean toward more the percussion and the vocal bits are pretty awesome. There's just really so much to this album that I am probably not going to do a good job of it. But these songs are all fairly catchy, and in its middle it may be the best part. "Wolf Like Me" and "A Method" for some reason happen to be my favorite songs on this album. The bass-heavy former is just so straight ahead and forceful that it's almost really impossible not to like. The former at one point sounds like it's about to end until more of the percussion sinks in. It also matches pretty much every quality to the album that I just mentioned.And many of the tracks are pretty easy to get into, like the single "Hours" and several others. Maybe even the whole thing. Even in its slower more melancholic moments like "Tonight" it is a completely enthralling listen. It sounds like the songs were a lot of fun to make without being overly self-indulgent, and then the songs work in spades for that reason. I'm sure people will try to dispute the band's creativity but they are morons and I refuse to listen to them. Unless it's backed up with something valid, that is. The three "bonus" songs toward the end don't let down the album, either.I recommend this to anyone who's tired of what's popular and wants a taste of something else. I'm sure plenty of those people already have and enjoy this work of genius. I think it'll be remembered as a great album of the decade, and I can only wonder where they'll go from here.

"People Are People" was the "album" made for the US when the title song broke the band through stateside and served a purpose to get people into the group. However, the best one-disc representation of the group isThe Best of Depeche Mode, Vol. 1, which has a span of the group's 25-year career (by that point). You may not own those, but just get the remastered versions ofA Broken FrameandConstruction Time Again. That being said, most of this can be recommended, but this is irrelevant in 2007. I will never completely vilify anything with "Everything Counts" on it, so I won't give anything with that song 1 stars. Besides, it isn't THAT bad, but it's just not worth it considering what else is out there.

Throughout the '80s, the times saw Depeche Mode growing as a band. Alan Wilder's inclusion on "Construction Time Again" turned them from a group to a great group, the next one showing they weren't teeny-bop with somewhat shocking (for the time) tracks like "Master and Servant." This may not had any big hits, but that also doesn't really mean it's ungood or esoteric. It is neither of these. It is perceived as DM's foray into goth which went into the next two albums. This can be heard in tracks like "Fly on the Windscreen -- Final" and "Stripped," a sign of the arena-size ambitions of the group. Martin, the song-writer, sings on four of the album's 12 songs, and most of them have some great emotion in them. "A Question of Lust" is one of the highlights, a brilliant track which shows that DM have a great deal of substance and are more than a fad. I love the musical arrangements; something comes off as aural bliss about tracks like "It Doesn't Matter Two" and "Dressed in Black." While it may be dark, it's not gloom for gloom's sake, and sometimes it can be happy too. For instance, the title track is an admiration of seeing good even in the darkest days, "I can feel your warmth and it feels like home," sounds like a good-day sentiment from "Here Is the House," and more importantly, there's "But Not Tonight." 20 years later, "Black Celebration" should be viewed of as just as good an album. I kind of would like to hear what a re-mastered version would sound like. A fan favorite and rightfully so.

That's what I'd have to say about this DVD from the Smashing Pumpkins. I mean, the music was excellent, but then there's the music videos which nearly rival that quality. But there's just so much in it that you will wonder why you haven't bought it yet already if you haven't and rejoice in that you have it if you do. There are 21 music videos; one of them an easter egg. The "Untitled" video is nothing special even though nice if you're as much of a Pumpkins fan as I am. It's just a studio performance. By the way, you get it if you press the left button after being on "Extras".The commentary is a nice addition. It talks about how most of these music videos were made. The directors for respective videos appear on all of the commentaries as well as Billy and James. Jimmy is on most of them as well, save for the "Adore"-era ones. There are FOUR options in the commentary of "1979". One of them is about the funny Lost Tapes story; the other are the typical commentary, but there's one that has the audio of the performance part of the music video. Also, you get to see the outtake/documentary footages as an option for each of the music videos, as well as a "live" performance on "Rocket".The extras have the "I Am One" music video, which was basically just performance; still kind of good even though pale in comparison to the other music videos. Then there's the short film "Try" by an occasional music video Jonas Ackerlund. It's a heartbreaking story and is worth seeing a few times.Even when they weren't huge they had some great music videos. It seems like they had a lot of fun in that park on the "Rhinoceros" music video, as well as the members playing instruments. Naturally, D'arcy makes it for me in some of these because I think that she is really gorgeous. Especially when she looks a bit different from the norm. I kind of find it humorous how in the guitar solo of "Zero", it goes to showing the keyboards rather than guitar. That's the really nicely done Roman-style music video. In the times when the songs represent the themes they were really good. People who don't see Smashing Pumpkins music videos don't know what good music videos are supposed to be like, from how I see it. I especially love looking at the outtake video of "The Everlasting Gaze", seeing them all destroy the equipment (one of them with Melissa Auf der Maur in them). I could go on and on but I'm sure you're already bored.I think the only single flaw with this DVD is that it did not have "The End Is the Beginning is the End". Darned rights of Warner Bros. But in the end, you'll be more than happy that you bought this great video collection. Who wouldn't want great visuals and great options? I think you'll be happy even if you generally don't care for the Pumpkins.

One thing I can tell you about Air's fourth non-soundtrack/comp LP is that it's not really a "first listen" album. Sure, it's way more consistent than "10,000 Hz. Legend," but it's also not as poppy and catchy as "Talkie Walkie" or as immediate as "Moon Safari." This isn't one of the more happier albums from the band, but it isn't a totally dark one either, unlike the "Virgin Suicides" score. The record takes a few listens to get into it but I think that it is totally worth it. Combined with the production, some of the songs here are amazing. Having Jarvis Cocker guest on here was something that worked in his favor; his vocals complement the songs very well. The JB-sung tracks are okay, but one thing I've always felt with Air is that the instrumentals are usually the most important thing in their music. My favorite songs here are "One Hell of a Party," "Lost Message," and "Between Waking and Sleeping." I recommend it, although maybe not so much as a starting point.

Well, I know that Ministry's career was/is supposed to end in a trilogy of anti-Bush albums. I guess if you like a lot of protest/political music, then that's something that works for you. I also realize that Al has made political music throughout his career. As for me: Enough is enough. The most "new" thing about the album is more of a metal sound than most of his works, but that's not a major difference really. Some of it is good, but it's not the most memorable album and the concept wears thin as you're listening to the album. We get the point, and it won't be changed for another two years, but come on: This is nothing particularly special. As the other reviewer said, "Greater Wrong of the Right" by Skinny Puppy was a much better leftist album than the two more recent from Ministry, and I actually enjoyed "Mol&eacute;", since that was also diverse and artistically interesting. This is just more of the same and it's not even interesting this time around. Next...

Sometimes a band's better work can still be overshadowed by others. It seems that the public and the press tend to valueThe Soft BulletinandYoshimi Battles the Pink Robotsmuch more, and as great as those are, I feel that this is about on par with them. It is not quite as soundscape-ish and not as conceptual, but just as good. The record actually kind of reminds me of what Jane's Addiction would be like if they were a dream pop band.The most famous of the 11 songs is easily "She Don't Use Jelly." That one's quite clever, and while it got them known as one hit wonders it doesn't mean the rest of the songs aren't catchy, or even good. I really love "Be My Head" with its effortless pop melodies and the flop follow-up "Turn It On" is a great track as well. The songs still have a psychedelic feel and I think that if you like the later Lips works that you'll like this. It's a noisy pop record on the whole, but then there's more gentle tracks like "Chewin' the Apple of Your Head" as well.I recommend this to fans of the later work or good alternative music in general. Speaking of which, in spite being released in the "grunge" era this was actually kind of the antidote, with songs that aren't really dark at all and have a somewhat lighthearted feel. I think you too will find enjoyment here.

You know what's interesting about this compilation is that while usually this sort of thing is used for people to "sell" new fans to the band, this "best of" seems more geared towards people who are already fans of the Violent Femmes. For one thing, the main versions are not always used in favor on here. For instance, "I Held Her in My Arms" and "Lies" appear in different versions than what are on "Blind" and "3." Also, the debut classics "Add It Up" (an old B-side on an import single) and "Kiss Off" are in live versions, in favor of the original. These are both good in their own right, but it seems somewhat enigmatic to introduce casual fans that way. Also, the fact that three of these "tracks" are more or less more spoken messages than actual songs. Not only that, but "Nightmares" was a genuine college radio hit and was omitted, although so was "Children of the Revolution," although maybe I'd understand excluding a T. Rex cover. Not because it's not the greatest, but to include more original VF material.Some of that is great. There's the early demo recording of "Waiting on the Bus" as well as later fare like "I Hate the TV", "36-24-36" and "Dance, M.F., Dance," a cover from an obscure Milwakee band.That being said, some of this is for unexperienced Femmes fans. "American Music" is possibly their most famous non-debut song and arguably the one that was most successful in its time. "Blister in the Sun" and "Gone Daddy Gone" are classics and are good introductions to the band as well. Then there's the more surprising stuff like the free jazz of "Black Girls" and others. It is mostly pretty good, even if some selections are lighweight curiosities. With this in mind, I suggest you try the band's debut and, if you like this variety, its follow-up, "Hallowed Ground" (which has "Black Girls", "Jesus...", and "CDS.")But if you're a casual fan and want a more conventional approach you may want to check out "Debacle" or its sequel, "Permanent Record", which represents three albums and a soundtrack song that came out after this release.

It's been a long time that I've acquainted to this particular JEW album. I still haven't yet gotten to the others but I'm sure this one isn't just a fluke but I also listen to a lot of other bands so some stuff gets lost in the shuffle. The songs are very easy to get into and it shows that making pop songs is not always watered down and not always a bad thing. Many people have lumped them in "emo" but they are not a stereotypical emo band, although that's really varied in itself. The songs are generally really positive and in some ways I've related to them from time to time.The album has an amazing four-track punch in the beginning, the anthemic "Bleed American", the poignant "Praise Chorus" and then of course we all know the excellent single "The Middle" and then it goes into a pretty good ballad with "Your House." It's hard to believe they were still pretty young when they made an album like this. It's one of the first I really got into and I still very much enjoy it today. I can pretty much listen to this album in any mood, which happens with some stuff and sometimes isn't as easy as you could wish.Chances are if you have a JEW album you have this. If not it's not a bad place to start. Admittedly a few tracks toward the end aren't quite as interesting but it still holds strong even now.

You know what's funny is that while I listen to quite a bit of underground music I never really felt that it was very necessary to flaunt it & then bash more popular artists to draw attention to others. Still, Sour's lone album, "Exactly What You Think It Is" is overdue for a review, and sadly, since very few people even know about it, has only one review before this.The group combines industrial, electronic, pop, new wave, and stuff that's in between. It's also a bit punk-ish in its execution. The record is done in half an hour and honestly I'm not concerned with lyrical depth on this. Instead, the record is so sexy and intense that it's hard not to enjoy. The singer is female, and while the music is agressive, she only sparingly really sounds that angry to me. Not really a bad thing to me. Some of it's more structured, but I like when the weird synths come in, like the intro of "Misery."The record is not well-known as it's from a low-distributed record label and this music was basically extent from music trend maps in its 2003 bow (contrary to this site, their official site mentioned it as having had been released in Feb. of '03). That being said, if you like some nice music for long nights then I recommend this record to you. And lastly I don't care if it doesn't "truly" do it like others; it's usually not the sole reason why I'm into a record anyway.

This isn't usually the type of review I do very good at but I'll try anyway. But after playing "III" and "Vice City", I was wondering what was next. Whereas some of it isn't written to be better, this one is perhaps the best yet, as it is the most realistic of them all. There are many areas of the place, beginning at Los Santos which is kind of a ghetto. It's also where you get to do bicycle riding, something previously undone. Many other things are capabilities and seem more realistic than the last time. The missions are not quite what they were on "Vice City" but nothing comes close to matching those (as you know, this time around it's in the west coast, with more low riders, blah blah blah). Some characters reappear from "III" on this one, but it is cool for most part that you get to swim back on to the land in this time. There is a factor of muscle/fat, etc. etc., so that's another thing to try to get good enough before possibly drowning. I also like how the missions are what opens up more of the availability in there. But when you complete them you're in it for more and more fun until you find yourself sick of playing this. Like how you can go to that casino and play all those games is just tons of fun and warrants that rating I gave it, which otherwise would have been a star lower. Besides, every radio station on there is wonderful. I would talk about that except that it would be off-topic. The flying is a bit of a challenge to learn but also a lot of fun to do. As a whole I think that it is more of a great buy than anything else.

While such a comparison to the following Delaughter-led band was unknown of at the time, it is known now. Where other Tripping Daisy records mixed psychedelia, grunge, and punk-pop (look at the order) in the albums, this was kind of a different horse from the rest of the album. Although, I'd have to say that it is truly UNLIKE anything I've ever heard. There is a lot of talent in this record. It sounds more creatively free than anything you've done, and unlike previous records, the songs are good enough to where you want to keep repeating the songs.It would be hard to talk about certain songs because they all blend in together so well. It wasn't exactly chamber pop that the next of Tim's bands would be, but this shows that they are in it 100% for the music and have nothing to do with image. The instrumentation is far more varied than other Tripping Daisy albums, yet the album itself is undeniably that band. At first you'll laugh at some over-happy moments, but when you give it the time, you'll love those songs just as much. Which is part of why I like this record. In a period where rock is supposed to be depressed/angry, Tripping Daisy favors a variety of pop (the GOOD kind) and making an album rather than a bunch of songs. That's also why it's the best Tripping Daisy album. While out of print, it's worth the time & money to get yourself ripped off JUST to get this album.

Okay, I've gotta admit something: I'm fairly new to the greatness of Isis. I've been aware of their existance for awhile and heardPanopticona couple times, but since I never get access to this type of music and I saw it at my local public library I decided to check it out. And that's one case where if the record sucks well it's okay because I didn't spend anything.And this one didn't and was just INCREDIBLE. It's hard to really describe Isis and this fourth LP from them. Apparently fans think of it as a change in sound and I remember "Panopticon" being a bit darker and angrier than this record, and "post-metal" is probably the closest thing to a good description of this. But you just have to listen; something they thank you for in the liner notes (my response: you're welcome!). It's not really "progressive" but may appeal to some fans of the style. They've been compared to Tool and I love that band, but this is a really different kind of horse. The only thing I could think of is that they both use a lot of instrumentals in the songs. But that's where the comparisons end, really. The vocals are more like an instrument, but a graceful addition to the mix.Also, recently finally going to Cave In's back catalog I was impressed to see a vocal contribution from the band's bassist in "1,000 Shards." It's hard to pinpoint real highlights on here. It's seriously an instance where you really HAVE TO hear it to believe it. Also, don't expect them to ever really hit the mainstream. Tool have a more upfront sound and are focused on structure; mood and ambience rule Isis and it's multiplied in higher volume. It's not totally metal, but I heard about them defying genre on previous efforts, and that's part of what's so nice about it. Also, the songs are all pretty long with the exception of the sixth track which to me seems more like an interlude than full song. Occasionally the stuff feels better in idea than execution but when the pros outweigh the cons that's forgivable.The record's a mindtrip. I recommend it to anyone into rock that does something new today. This is like audio meditation for me.

While you may have heard Modest Mouse from seeing videos on their new album from MTV, and 'Good News...' was a good (not great) album, there is a lot of old-school Mouse that you should discover. These albums are fun and full and ambition, especially this one. This album has varied song lengths and still manages to get things done in a fun way. Some of the melodies are very drawn out ("con-vee-nya-he-he-he-ent"), although even that makes it enjoyable. No song on here is bad, like at all. You go from tracks about parking and highways to one that is really interesting with full Middle Eastern instrumentation -- complete with a fiddle solo in the outro. Then you get ten minute songs that follow with two-minute songs, etc., and they are just as much fun. The "repeat" button was invented for albums like this.This and 'The Moon & Antarctica' are both really worthy buys. There's a reason these indie people keep saying such great things about them.

When I heard &quot;Little Black Back Pack&quot; and &quot;Letters&quot;, I was hooked. Those happen to be some of the better songs on here. This is kind of bland, so I can't keep myself liking it as much as I could. It kind of reminds me of Better Than Ezra (not that that's a bad thing). There is a lot of filler here, and that's evident.However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have its moments. Other than the other two, I also like &quot;Tail of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Not Nothin'&quot;, &quot;One Time&quot;, and &quot;Tear Me In Two&quot;. Those all have strong points to them. I know that there's mainly an acoustic guitar on &quot;Tail&quot;, but it doesn't lack much direction. But I love what I've heard from the next Stroke 9 album, so I'm not totally sure what to think of it, though I kind of like it. Enough to not sell it at least. There isn't a whole lot of lyrical subtlety, either, though it is catchy. But if you like that type of thing, then buy it.

M.I.A.'s sophomore album "Kala" continues some of what people knew her to be during the first album. This is still dance stuff, filled with certain samples that range from monotonous to interesting, with all kinds of tracks. And what separates her from many at times is the bigger use of world/tribal sounds at times. I am not as big on this album as others but it doesn't mean that they're wrong or anything.The "low" (for some) rating has more to do with it being a mixed bag for my money than anything else. It's an album where a lot of the more listenable moments come later rather than in the first half. "Paper Planes" is understandably the hit here, with a sample of the Clash's guitars and awesome gunshots used in the chorus. The sound effects actually turn out clever, way more interesting than what you'd hear on a lot of hip-hop records. Add that with the Timbaland production "Come Around" and you get a nice two-punch for the album. It's probably more streamlined sounding than the rest of the record, although since she intended to enlist him the record would have perhaps sounded more like this. However, the end result is probably a lot more unique. You gotta dig the synths on "XR2" as well as it's catchy lyrics. For me it's like this album's "Bucky". But there's good enough songs at the first half, like "Hussel" which uses the tribal beat thing to a good measure. "Bamboo Banga" is a nice way to kick off the album.There's some stuff I don't really like all that much, like the many guests (kids, in particular) rapping on "Mango Pickle Down River," which lacks a lot of direction, but I suppose this remix was intended for the album's use. If there's a track I skip here it's probably this one. It's an unpopular opinion but I'm not really big on the whole with the kind of redundant ideas on "Boyz" and "Bird Flu" which kind of give me a headache after three minutes or so. Some people like those, just not myself. And some stuff is kind of just there. I like that she interpolated "Where Is My Mind" for a song but unforunately that song ("20 Dollar") is kind of boring.It is sold pretty cheap so even if you hate it there wouldn't be too big a fuss for getting it. And I do recommend "Kala" on the whole. For me it doesn't always hit but sometimes it does, and enough to keep your attention.

I remember when I was young and Busta Rhymes was one of the first rappers I had gotten into. In fact, I have three of his other albums and have heard another one. But this one seems the least consistent. "It Ain't Safe No More" was kind of mediocre but was kind of similar through quality in the rest of the album. "The Big Bang" has great production and Busta sounds great, but unfortunately that does not make the entire album.Well, I can't get over the misogyny of certain tracks, most particularly in "I Love My B----," or in other tracks. In some songs, the samples are saving graces, like the chorus of "Touch It" which puts Daft Punk in or "In the Ghetto," an interesting reflective song of youth. I actually like most of the guests on here, and some of it is enjoyable. As the main review said, Swizz Beatz should just stick to producing, he didn't add much with "New York S---" which otherwise was fine and the album could have been cut about half its time length, in spite taking four years to come out.I actually think "The Big Bang" is an okay album, but I think it has its flaws. I was actually a bit hesitant to buy it for other said reasons, but I found it for $4 used and figured I could just sell it if I decided I didn't want it. It's nothing special and I prefer the other three Busta albums I own -- "The Coming," "When Disaster Strikes..." and "Genesis."

I'm going to get one thing clear: While this may be a double album, it is not really that shocking of a release. It is also not my favorite RHCP album, as I like "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" and "By the Way" considerably more. That being said, some of the moments on here are amazing, like "Desecration Smile" and "Hard to Concentrate," the former showing that they can make the perfect pop song and the latter showing they've still got the funk in them. I don't actually get how people who didn't like the last two albums would jump over this release, but if you're okay with this sort of thing, it's totally fine. It's a little bit overlong for me and plenty tracks ring to me as just average, but it's worth checking out and not too bad of a double-album price.

Well, this is certainly one that's quite an interesting listen. Not really essential or anything, but it's worth hearing at least once. This more than signals them defying themselves from the "garage-rock" pigeonhole. Instead, they do things that can't even be described. Except that the two amazing songs here are the ones that have forms done somewhere else. The live "You've Got Her in Your Pocket" is excellent and just as tender as it was before. "Blue Orchid", the title track, is a great track which shows Jack in an interesting falsetto and almost robotic-like instrumentation. But Meg's drumming reminds you that it's the White Stripes.The other two tracks exist, and I prefer one to the other. "Though I Hear You Calling..." is a great song as far as the lyrical department goes and was understandably left off, but if you have an open mind, it's worth checking out. However, it's "Who's a Big Baby" that's just a plain head-scratcher. It doesn't sound anything like the White Stripes, heck that doesn't even sound like Meg! It is a single which shows the growth of the band in its B-sides even better than "Get Behind Me Satan" itself. However, that is a more consistently good batch of songs. This single is worth checking out for the casual fan, though.

Okay, I can't tell you it's worth buying this for eighteen bucks (I got it here when it was on a good discount). However, for a fan ofVheissuthis should come off as a treat that it is. You get two of the three B-sides released ("Lullaby" is on the sixth Hopelessly Devoted comp.). The tracks are great, especially the second track. It shows some of the band's great skills and lyrics and is a nice addition to the band's back catalog.Then there are four acoustic tracks, one already released, three not. There's "Of Dust and Nations" from the three-track AOL sessions disc and then you get an acoustic version of the fairly heavy "Under a Killing Moon," which is a nice addition. "Red Sky" is also slightly reworked on here. I prefer the more passionate and melodic singing of the original although this folk-ish version is pretty good in its own right, a difference from the textured album version. "For Miles" is not a miss either; it's a great song in its own right. It has almost a dreamy feel on this album.I recommend this to people into the band's recent output who would like to grow their Thrice collections.

I don't care what the older fans say in their complaints, a band who doesn't evolve just gets less interesting. Which is why "Subkutan" is such a great record, possibly my favorite from De/Vision. All 12 songs are great, or 13 if you include the remix of "Subtronic," a song that starts to get you movin'. There's some sort of industrial moments, like "Addict" which sounds like what Skinny Puppy may sound like if they added melody and listened to Depeche Mode. Some songs build to their climaxes, like "Star-Crossed Lovers." My other favorite moments are "E-Shock," which is musically fascinating, "Still Unkonwn," and "My Own Worst Enemy." Listen to it with an open mind; you'll get into it. They can't be a junior-Depeche Mode all the time, and they realize they're above a tribute band, which is why an album such as "Subkutan" was made. Not my absolute favorite of the year but probably in my top 10 for then.

Well, the album could work for other seasons as well, but since it's currently winter and the cover art makes me think of a nice, snowy day, I felt the pointless need to title that. Well, this is one of her most lush works that I've heard of her solo (I've never heard Kukl and know little Sugarcubes). Her "Med&ugrave;lla" album is also lush, but it's a bit too vocal-based for my tastes although intruguing.But we enter "Vespertine," which almost feels romantic in its beauty. In fact, I think love is the theme in a track like "Cocoon." The lyrics are some of her greatest, and that's saying a lot coming from an artist who is pretty consistent in that part. Every song on here is great, from the more typical Bj&ouml;rk standard "Hidden Place," to the playful interlude "Frosti," and everything in between and after. I also really like "It's Not Up to You" and "Pagan Poetry" lots. The former is really gorgeous towards the end and is an example of her good lyricism. "Pagan" is just plain sonic brilliance, I could totally picture this track in like a surreal scene in a movie. The hook in the keyboards is timeless. The song is one of the more sad on the album, though. It is an amazing album and makes the soundtrack to sleep a warm one.Totally recommended to anyone into that sort of thing.

Oh man, I can't believe how overlooked this album got. Little publicity, and not really a critical hit, this album is still very great, as it shows the band expanding what they do. This album has so much variety, I can't believe some write it off as boring. And that's what I thought of Where Have All The Merrymakers' Gone? at my first listen. Although I like it now. However, this is one of my all-time favorites, because it keeps depth, and has some pleasant surprises. However, go to your used bin or pawn shop if you must to get this.Meetings With Remarkable Men: This has things at its own pace, and the lyrics are real clever here. They meet Jesus Christ in a brunch, just before He dies for their sins, later with the avatar who says it's clear he's never got over Morrissey (how can you hate that?), then later to KIP WINGER! That's the surprises.Humility On Parade: Lyrics continue to impress, and it's a standard HD track. Actually, it's my least favorite on here, despite the fact that I like it a lot, and the track is just a bit too consistent for me.Why I'm Lonely: This one's excellent. Sean kind of sings in a whiny voice, but it gets better as it goes on, and you'll just have to listen 'cuz you'll eventually be hooked. I've always loved it.Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo: One of my least favorites, but still excellent. It is very simple, although it's got more musical growth than one might expect. It still has clever lyrics, including, &quot;The Marlboro Man died of cancer. And he wasn't a rocket scientist when he was healthy&quot;.. You'll sing along with the chorus, as well as the song's first line, &quot;not another existential cowboy&quot;Another one that's great if you give time is &quot;You Miss The Point Completely I Get The Point Exactly&quot;, a song that I can't say too much about. While it's one of my least favorite tracks here, that doesn't say much, because everything here is great. The guitars sound familiar with most other modern rock. Listen to it because it flows well with &quot;Francais interlude&quot;, a dream interlude that appears as the same track number as its predecessor song itself!Then, it gets to the excellent, &quot;Authenticity&quot;. It is the catchiest song on here, and sounds a bit like &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;. However, this is shorter, and Sean Nelson's vocals sort of distinct the two songs, and there isn't really organ use on this one.The fun doesn't stop just there. You get to &quot;(theme from) Carjack Fever&quot;, which is a song that is for those who like songs that are just crazy. This one has some pretty stream-of-conscienceness lyrics in the car metaphor, it's addictive. Sean Nelson sounds excited when he yells on this. The coolest part though is the intro.It goes from that insanity to the lovely piano ballad, the sensitive &quot;Pike St./Park Slope&quot;, which is in the style of Ben Folds. It reveals a conversation with a girl, and features excellent lines such as &quot;when I like something, it's an opinion, when you like something, it's a manifesto.&quot; That strong song follows with the line, &quot;pomposity is when you think you're right, arrogance is when you know.&quot; I completely disagree with the Amazon.com editorial review on this one. Just listen to Jeff Linn's excellent use of the violin here!This Is The Thrilling Conversation You've Been Waiting For: This pokes fun at the political-correctness of speech, and is just as witty and clever as any other track on here. It's a pretty good song, and I think it'll keep you listening on.It then follows with the strong six-minute &quot;Loyalty Bldg&quot;, which doesn't end up as boring because there's enough edge in that one.Then you get into a cover of This Busy Monster's &quot;Underground&quot;, but I can't compare that with the original since I haven't heard it, but it's edgy enough, and it starts out pretty cool as well.Expanding their musical horizon doesn't end until the album ends. And that is with the excellent &quot;The Same As Being In Love&quot;, which you'll repeat over and over again. It's as melodic as the other songs on here, as well as featuring insturments like banjo and triangle, which only help sharpen and expand the sound of the album. A great way to close things.Also, you should check out the &quot;footnotes&quot; on the lyric booklet, which are pretty funny. Some stuff doesn't make a lot of sense with where they're included, including stuff such as &quot;list of authors cited&quot;. Also, they are all good at what they play, and Sean Nelson sounds like a cross between Morrissey and Frank Black, with a menacing vocal range like that.It's a lot better than the first one in my opinion, although you should buy it because it's got &quot;Problems And Bigger Ones&quot;, and is good as well. I bet with Sean's The Long Winters coming along, indie people are biting they're tongues for ignoring this. Buy this if you like any alt-rock.

One great thing about independent labels is the compilations of artists on their record labels. This is actually a good way to find good new music, for me at least. It's kind of like a hard-rock equivalent of "Punk-O-Rama" (or now, they call it "Unsound"). The first of the series that I got was the seventh in the series. I was a really big Dillinger Escape Plan by them (still am), and was interested in a few of those bands. I was pleasantly surprised how some of those sounded and was also impressed with some of the stuff that didn't seem typical of their representation (Zombi and Zeke come to mind).As for this one, there's one disc that I enjoy and one disc that I find no enjoyment in, really. I wasn't expecting much in some of these, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear the chill 27 and also melodic Amber Asylum, who are a totally different horse for the record label. In addition, I really liked the Neurosis song, which actually makes me want to getA Sun That Never Setseventually. Nile are maybe for other people, but I personally had little taste for them. In fact, dislike is the polite way to put that one. I was kind of surprised how quickly the song on the second disc from East/West Blast Test was, are they some instrumental hardcore band or something? I liked the first few songs on there quite a bit as well.Admittedly, I generally like my music way more melodic than this is (especially the second disc). However, I did find enjoyment in about half of the tracks so it was fine enough for me. Besides, you won't be throwing that much money away if you buy this. I got it for $6.

According to Steven Wilson, this was the band's most ambitious and accessible release. I'll give it that it's pretty accessible. Many talk about howLightbulb Sunis more pop than progressive but I think in all fairness that can be said about this release too. That one had "Russia on Ice" which wasn't quite pop from Wilson.There isn't any filler (well, bar the title interlude) on this album but there's nothing real spectacular either, if you ask me. It's just a decent record, albeit one that referencesThe Bends("Piano Lessons"). The arrangements are respectable and while there's nothing real wrong with it I never really get into it. It's sort of just there for me. "A Smart Kid" is probably my favorite. This album does have that kind of dark theme prevalent to most of their albums. I do recommend this album, and for me 3 sometimes means a decent record.Calling it stupid is harsh, and I think most people will get something out of this. But me, I prefer everything that came after.

I hate to admit this, but while I love Garbage a lot, and like the three first unforced albums, this album gives me a different thought. For one thing, the album isn't near as interesting as previous Garbage albums, and while it's not really awful by any stretch, you've gotta wonder where the band who gave us the masterpiece "Version 2.0" went. I realize that they tried to do more "rocking" stuff than its predecessor, but actually, I find myself bored with some of what I hear on here.There are some great moments, however. "Bleed Like Me", while sick and twisted, is a nice change of pace on the album and I also enjoy the chord progression. There's also the grunge-but-not-derivative "Sex Is Not the Enemy" which is quite catchy, one of the few tracks I actually feel like listening to again and again. There are other good tracks, but these two are the main ones that I enjoy.For some reason, while there tends to be a certain energy, it doesn't always feel like the music from each members is going in the same direction. A good example would be "Why Do You Love Me", which was the first single but kind of weak for Garbage. And in spite of having Dave Grohl in it, I wasn't really impressed with "Bad Boyfriend". Oh, and they're well in at least their mid-30's right? Well, it would help if the lyrics were more like that... At its worst, it just seems rather forced or something, but at its best is when they make a track that can stick for awhile and is rather interesting. Maybe I was hoping for some more electronic elements, because I usually realize that with most bands I like who combine electronica and rock, I tend to like it when they use some of both, especially the former. But it's decent.It won't really turn minds of the people who didn't like Garbage before, and it seems like this will be a release that's played more by more die-hard fans than people who want to listen to something that will excite them. I'm sure it does do that for some people, but it just doesn't happen like that with me. But hearing one of my favorite bands release a slightly underwhelming release always worries me to a certain extent.
