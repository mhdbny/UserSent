Often unheard of poet, Ogden Nash, serves as a reminder that poetry itself does not need to be mushy, polite or romantic. Or for that matter psychological, philisophical or religious. Nash's poetry, written from the early 20's to the late 50's is remark on the social niceties. A critique of the love-hate relationship of men and women. A funny peek into the lives of animals. And silly stories for the sake of being silly. The uniqueness in Nash's work is not the poetry itself, but his play with words. Its clear he does not take language seriously at all which allows him to mix and maneuver words to create new ones that will create a genuine laugh. Such as: &quot;Well I have learned that life is something about which you can't conclude anything except that it is full of vicissitudes. And when you expect logic you only come across eccentricitudes.&quot; The other aspect of Nash's writing is his outlaw verse where, although things rhyme, the rythm is thown askew.&quot;I know that a year has rolled around once moreWhen I find myself thumbing a crisp new cigarette lighter just like the coven of other cigarette lighters strewn on a shelf in the garage along with the broken tire chains and the license plates for 1934.&quot;Nash's work was surely ahead of its time and I am dleighted to have come across such remarkable work. I highly reccomend this, not just to poetry lovers, but also to those that appreciate language and humor.

Orwell's classic book on thought control, mind control, body control and just about any kind of control you could think of, is a powerful book that many people hold in regards to as being prophetic. Time has passed and other realizations occur, however, this book still stands as a monument, not only in fiction, but in our understanding and use of technology as either entertainment or mass media awareness, ergo; programming. With Erich Fromm writing an afterword, which he cites many examples that displays different types of utopias/thought controlled societies, discussing the psychological aspects of a society that is shaped in such a way, reminiscing from his own book Escape From Freedom. A classic book in every way, and may best be appreciated with Huxley's Brave New World (confer Neil Postman's 'Amusing Ourselves To Death'). Highly reccomended in any study of literature.

&quot;No problem is so big that it can't be solved in 12 reels (or less)&quot;. This is a typical statement that one reads in large font opposite of a movie still that complements it. This book is funny and will make you laugh and maybe even says &quot;Huh! Thats true!&quot;, or &quot;Oh yeah!&quot; The book is not really a read, so to speak, but a gander across some 200 pages which will take minutes to complete. The title itself is a play on Robert Fulghum's (forever parodied) popular self-help book &quot;Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&quot;. Not something I would go out of my way for, however it has some insight into the world of movies and how there are some things that typify the cinematic lifestyle.

A strange story of a mans internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. This book translated by MacAndrew includes other stories beyond 'Diary of a Madman.' I confess here I only bought the book for this story and that is all I read, based on Nabakov's reference. The writing by Golgol interesting, yet confusing at times and most certainly; odd, as the story is. Quite mundane in the beginning, while the finale is quite a shocker. A worthwhile read, but nothing to hop off your seat over.

Originally an HBO production with three unseemingly related stories that all take place in the same Hotel Room. I would not reccomend this film to just anyone, but to die-hard David Lynch fans, they might eat this up. As much as I love Lynch's work, this one was tough to swallow. Although the stories themselves were intriguing, I cant say they went beyond that, nor did I see any connection between them. This film remains a strange one without the mystery and suspense of classic Lynch film.

Tolkein's now classic fairy tale of the land of Middle Earth and its inhabitants, the Hobbits, is an enchanting and mythical story of the underdog hero Bilbo. The so-called prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually a splice or intersection of the Ring in which Bilbo discovers the ring in Golem's cave. The story of Bilbo and his adventures is classic lore of slaying the dragon to win the pot of gold. With his band of misfits and hungry tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum gnomes, there is a comic ambiance to the story that helps the reader through some of the slow scenes. While this is not a must read to understand the Ring Trilogy, it certainly is a worth while read unto itself without the burden of two more books to complete the journey. Tolkein's writing is fun and witty while asking the reader to understand a few new words in his created language. There are times as well that the story slows down either for narrative purposes where the writing speaks to you, the reader, or for the group to sing a song to celebrate their happiness in the style of medieval celtic literature. While the book is reccomended and in some cases manditory, it's an overall enjoyable read.

While it was nice to see "the gang" back together again reprising their roles, it appeared immediately that American Pie 2 was a rehash of the first in lesser grade. Back home for summer from their first year as college students, the gang is out for more ways to get some action - obviously college taught them nothing. Each member is still attached to the previous episode of high school charm and humor. So much so, that they keep bringing up past events as if they would be funny again. I remember thinking as I was watching the film, those were funny moments, but why are they not funny here? I realized they were not funny because they were memories. As the moral of the story later sets in, that one cannot live in the past and cling to memories, so should have the writers considered this when writing the script. I would like to further note that I got the distinct impression that all of the actors held a sense of self-consciousness in thier acting. Most notably Michelle, the band camp girl. It was as if Michelle and the rest of the crew were going through some sort of thespian puberty; highly aware of their popularity and the comradery that they are supposed to have with each other. This did not ring through for me like the first one did. I sensed in the first one they were all true friends, as if they grew up with each other. While in this film, they were getting the job done to get paid and go home. My expectations to laugh uncontrolably may have set my ability to be highly critical of the film, and I really wanted to laugh, however, I felt that all of the humor missed the mark by a few inches. The situational humor versus the "memorial" humor is obviously the key to its success, as the first American Pie demonstrated each moment to be as funny as the next. The sequel proved that the first one is still funny, and also humor needs to take action and not to be remembered.

What can be said about this film? If you have not seen it, then go see it. Classic at every turn. Not a line or action wasted. Bogart in his most celebrated role as the suave and charismatic Rick, along with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. One of the films that makes Hollywood great! Highly reccomended to anyone and everyone. The DVD version, however, is well packaged and presented. With trailers from a variety of classic films, along with a half hour documentary on the making of Casablanca hosted by Lauren Bacall. A good transfer with quality sound, well worth the price. Whether VHS or DVD, you will get your moneys worth with this timeless classic that will begin a beautiful friendship.

This DVD release purports that there are 62% more laughs than the original. It would indicate, then, that the original theatrical release lacks 62% of its humor, which is probably accurate.I grew up with my family enjoying the original television series, yet I never got into it. But I am familiar with the characters enough to watch this movie and have an idea of what I am about to see. Steve Carell stars as Maxwell Smart, who is out for his first official duty as an agent in active duty, despite his expertise in research. He eventually is paired up with the incredibly sexy Anne Hathaway, as Agent 99. Together, they are an excellent team and work very well together. Hathaway is surprisingly on time with her comedic delivery and is able to keep up with Carell.The movie plays out entertainingly with little wasted space in the film. In light of Hathaway and Carell's excellent chemistry together, the comedy in the film is flattened by the action. I did not find myself laughing out loud in any of the scenes, although they should have been funny. I cannot pin point exactly what was missing, or maybe simply the fact I expect Maxwell Smart that humor be his character flaw, rather than a humorous situation.Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23, actually provides more of the unexpected humor in the film than anyone else. He has grown out of his wrestling roots as well as his all-out muscle-head action hero stereotype and can be taken seriously (even in a comedy).Alan Arkin rounds out the main characters as the head of control who is totally in his environment and plays it off perfectly. Surprisingly, there are some nice cameos throughout the film like Kevin Nealon and Bill Murray.Despite how much I liked the film, there is the element of comedy that is missing. Well, let me justify that. I am not sure this film needs to be as funny as it advertises. Its probably difficult to advertise this film as something that is a good action film with some light humor. With Carell in the lead, its hard to advertise he is serious in his role, despite that his character has humorous qualities. So the advertising just leaned all the way in comedy - which is where the disappointment comes in (or misrepresentation).In sum, Carell is perfectly cast as Maxwell Smart, to the point where he almost looks like Don Adams in the original TV series. Hathaway is not only sexy to watch, but shows intelligence and strength in her role. She is perfectly capable of holding the scene on her own, and also allowing the other cast to be part of the scene. She might be the one reason to see the film. If she is not already a major star, expect her to be very soon! GET SMART is a well crafted film in every way with expectantly funny bits that do not get in the way of the action (if not undermined). I do recommend the film to watch, but whether to own is at your discretion.

R. Buckminster Fuller's (Bucky hereout), designer of the geodesic dome (one can see at EPCOT), lays down the thought patterns of a successful world in this short and concise book based on his discoveries (probably more appropriate than inventions, as he said &quot;I am not tryingto imitate nature, I'm trying to find the principles she uses&quot;). It is in this book that Bucky gives the reader insight into how he thinks, and how to change ones thinking entirely, to see the Earth as a Spaceship. To feel yourself riding the Earth as a Spaceship. Demonstrating from the anceint &quot;pirates&quot; and how evolution is changed through specialization. How a wealthy nation, such as ours, cannot afford to make economical mishaps or delays on such life-giving elements as water. Moving our modes of consciousness into Einsteinian, omni-directional thinking, we can then turn to everyone to &quot;co-operate.&quot; To help others, and not gain at the expense of others. Certainly a classic in its own right, this book will change the way you think, not about life or the world, just that you change your thinking, making every action a universal consequence. There is only one Earth, and we are all living in it. Reccomended!

Sigmund Freud is not known for his easy-to-read writing style. Those that translated Freud's works have recently been under fire for being misleading or inaccurate. When I set out to read this book, I felt it neccessary to make as many notes neccesary and to dig beneath and between to bring out what Freud really meant by "ego" and "id." To my conclusion, the reason Freud is argued against so much is because of the confusion that surrounds his theories.The words "ego" and "id" are Greek, and we have carried them into the English language and then nominalized. By doing this our consciousness solidifies them as things within our brains. The word "ego" means "I" or "self". The word "id" means "non-I" or "non-self", or "it." We dont say "the I" when we refer to ourselves. But so often we say "the ego" as if to refer to a specific part or thing of our minds.The other confusion that adds to nominalization is then believing the rest of the book is about things in space. Yet, Freud specifically says, "The state of things which we have been describing can be respresented diagramatically, though it must be remarked that the form chosen has no pretensions to any special applicability, but is mere intended to serve for purposes of exposition (p. 18)." What Freud is saying is that in order to communicate clearly what is happening in ones psyche, or mind, there needs to be a working model of the psyche.That is to say, a model meaning a diagram with its parts that do not act as the psyche itself (or of reality), but shows what the psyche consists of. He does this by discerning that which is "descriptive," and that which is "dynamic." The descriptive only describes through language or imaginative use, while dynamic is more at the process that actually occurs.Now the model Freud eventually used as a diagram is not a very good model. In fact it is a bit unwieldy and clumsy and in the end served little purpose (later in he updated the model in 'New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis', 1933). Because Freud is the first to devise the model, it is primitive and modifications would be neccessary. Actually Freud seemed to have modeled what looks to be an ill-defined organ giving way to the idea that it functions like a heart would. While reading the book, I chose not to use the model he drew, but rather found it useful to create my own based on his descriptions of where things are in relation to each other. This does not mean I believe the model is a literal drawing of my mind or anyone elses, but rather a means in which we understand how one part of the psyche works with another. Similarly is Neil Bohr's model of the atom. He did not draw what he actually saw, he created a model only for communication purposes. When a group understands the parts, and the relationship of those parts, then you create a vernacular, or as Freud called it, a "shibboleth of psycho-analysis." Then we can clearly understand what we are talking about when referring to these parts.The book is only psychological in language, where Freud describes his theories of ego and id. He raises other aspects of the psyche that one may need to already understand, such as cathexis, the Oedipal complex, displacement, reaction formation and so forth. He sets out essentially how ego is created in relation to id, and by creating our ego we also create repression. It is sometimes misconstrued that ego is associated with egotistical, or egotism, or even conceit, however, Freud is aware that our ego is as much benevalent as malevalent."The Ego and the Id" was written in 1923, so the language is sometimes archaic, even in the translated form. Its more popular to be adverse with Freud, usually due to the claims Freud made regarding childhood sexuality, and that all of his theories are based upon sexual experiences in our youth. I believe if one set that opinion aside and read as if you never heard of Freud, you might think differently. I found it useful while reading not only to understand the times Freud wrote in, but to also update the language in more modern terms. If ego does not suit you, choose another word, as long as the relationships and understanding of their functions remain constant. But what you call them may reveal that Freud really hit the mark in describing the functions and processes of our minds. When you observe as he did, you will discover how memories are repressed, what your consciousness holds, what you observe in your consciousness and what you are holding out on in your unconscious. How our ego's and super-ego's (ego-ideal) serve and protect, yet hinder potential. For me, updating the language allowed me to understand Freuds work much better than if I kept his work in the past and attempted to apply it to today. I dont feel that works for any author. It would be like knowing how to fix an Apple IIe and expecting to be able to fix a Macintosh G3 computer.Freud's "Ego and the Id" is a great book to begin to understand his theories. Its a small book (62 pages) and will create the foundation of understanding for any of his other works. Having a good working knowledge of this book will also aid you in reading other authors who discuss ego functions as well as your ability to discern how the word is used in relation to Freud's understanding.

This is the first play by Arthur Miller I have read, and I inquired into mostly because of my interest with Witchcraft and the Salem trials. A wonderful play that shows the hypocrisy of a town threatened by purported withcraft. The cried of &quot;witch&quot; by anyone in this town aroused and scared everyone. The lead characters Abagail Williams along with Reverend Parris and John Proctor. I will not give any story here, for you should read it and be surprised and amazed. Nonetheless, the story lets one wonder how such a town and belief in the Bible (more so than God) can lead to such havok. The laws are simple: 1) You are not a witch until someone points the finger at you. 2) You can deny these charges, but you will be hung. 3) If you confess you are a witch, then the sentence is jail. 4) If you do not believe in withcraft you will be hung. These were the beliefs of the time, and it is demonstrated in this marvelous play. Arthur Miller tells an exciting story based on history (although he says its not literal history for there were some need for dramatic purpose), of a time when things were simple in America and Massachusettes, yet like all towns in the world, there is always something brewing in the minds of the good who want to banish evil from their homes. Highly reccomended!

Weird, weird, weird. But I liked it! Its not a jolting weird or an uncomfortable weird, rather a soothing, almost psychedelic weird that places you softly on the couch and let things roll over your brain. At first read thats what it will do, roll over your brain while you try to put the pieces together. For a large portion of it, the oddities of the characters and bizarre humor took me by surprise and in delight of what may happen next. At one point I am on the edge of my seat and other moments I am reclined not sure if want to find out. The few bits which ring out presently are some of the humerous touches that Thomas Pynchon creates. Its like a subtle stylized humor (yet realistice in one manner), and one I have not come across in any other book; a scene that can be so vivid in my mind, yet the writing simultaneously elusive and seemingly vague. I am happy to mention and conclude that the title of the book is well explained in such a way that I found it profound. I picked up this book because of a suggestion by R.A. Wilson, which seemed intriguing, and also the length was more tangible than his milestone Gravity's Rainbow. I figure this might be a good book to start before I embark on such a mission to determine if I even want to tackle it. Nonetheless, the Crying Lot of 49 remains an enigma in my mind that is something that deserves to be read again to clear up the fuzzy spots. Reccomended for those curious about Pynchon without the weight of pages to sweat over. Also reccomended to those who are interested in conspiracy theories and the like.

A nice book for someone who wants to step out of the Chrisitian binds of philisophical thinking and move ahead (or across) to a more humanistic or individual approach, instead of worldly, and use a philosophy that has practicality. This book does not neccesarily subscribe any specific school of thought, runs it down in a very simple matter-of-fact manner which is essentialy for any human to begin thinking for themselves. The aim of this little book is to allow the student to become a practictioner in the awareness of his surroundings, speech and actions and to learn, benefit and change any process that one deems unacceptable, namely the individual. A good book, to the point and reccomended for anyone looking for a change and needs a place to start.

An awesome book written in the early 1800's. Completely different than I had anticipated and much more violent than I had thought. Mary Shelly's mind at the ripe age of 19 created this scary modern myth of a &quot;monster&quot; run amuck among the townspeople, brought to life by the one Victor Frankenstein. Classic in every respect and deserves a standing ovation when you are done reading.

There are 5 audio cassettes that will take you roughly 5 hours to listen to. But once you listen to Manly Hall's lectures on Paracelsus you will be moved, inspired and amazed. Paracelsus, whose super long name I will not write here, is considered the father of alchemy. Using his experience and insight of both the medical and chemistry fields of study to understand the nature of the natural universe. This is the universe which exists without filters the mind uses to discriminate between left and right, good and bad, right and wrong. That which is left is between (the word Parzival literally means &quot;between the mountains). This essentially was known at the time as 'ether'. Today we refer to it as astral, or neurotransmitter. These lectures by Manly Hall are well thought out, clearly stated and scholarly in nature. Hall gives a comprehensive look at the world of Paracelsian thought as well as the life of Paracelsus. The only drawback to this collection is the sound quality. While sometimes, as the reviewer for the 'Alchemy' collection noted, you have to &quot;squint your ears&quot; in order to hear some of his words. Some parts were clear with little trouble understanding what Hall says, other times its muffled and gets lost. I know I dont have the best quality tape deck in my car (and listening in the car will limit my hearing as well), but it is a noticable change in quality from one tape to the next. Hall gives you a truck load of information and to absorb it all will not happen in one listening. Many are reqiured if one is out to get a full grasp of this Masters work. Highly reccomended.

I admit it. I caught the Titanic wave when the movie came out. I was intrigued by the story of the huge boat sinking in the middle of nowhere and 1500 people freezing and drowing to death on a boat that splits in half sinking to the ocean depths. Its a little better than the nightly news. Walter Lord, authority on the Titanic chronology sets out a most detailed account of the sinking, from the maiden voyage to the sinking, each accounted for on the clock. The book was full of facts, however, I felt it was dry most of the time. I am not arguing the author, just his writing. I am not all together interested in every member of the crew, nor every passenger. Least of all am I worried about every little detail or account. The appendix has a complete listing of every member on board of the ship, who died and who survived. The story overall is the same and fascinating still. The inability to answer the question of &quot;why did no one respond?&quot; still remains even though we know the whole story. Certainly the best account on the Titanics chronology available to date.

Edgar Rice Burroughs, now catalogued as a classic writer actually became instantly famous before this book with his Princess of Mars book published in 1912, while this book later in 1914. The story of a lost boy in the jungles of Africa where the parents are mauled and killed by Apes, and likewise, the son taken up and raised as one. If you are familiar either with the new Disney rendition or the Hollywood Johnny Weissemuller versions, then you just have not met Tarzan, Lord Greystoke. Both Hollywood and Disney do an injustice, not only to Burroughs, but also to the story and the writing. Embarking on this book, I expected a quick fun, high adventure story that gets to the point without finesse or care of the medium. But E. R. Burroughs gives you all the excitement with the careful delivery of choice words to put you there. There is a lot more emotion centered around this book than one may expect from a jungle adventure. Subtle, but poignant are his words and a visual clarity of the personalities and action make this a worthwhile read, and certainly a classic that can stand next to many other verbosely exaggerated popular classics (I am not mentioning Dickens).

Oedipus has certainly become famous in both the theater as well as in psychology. To just know the Freudian term does not justify the greatness of this play. As Aristotle deems this the &quot;perfect play,&quot; which still is valid in todays drama. This particular edition translated by Bernard Knox also includes photos of ancient Greek artwork as well as a head of Sophacles with an introduction to the history of the play. A great read for literature and play lovers!

Manly Hall's short work on reincarnation and astrology is a good read, however, one might not quite grab onto his ideas immediately if one reads this book in isolation to Hall's other works. I think to really benefit from this book, one should read Hall's other books on Reincarnation and Astrology for I think his ideals differ slightly than from what is written elsewhere. This way to get a firm foundation on what the author understands as "reincarnation" and "astrology" would make this book clearer. My personal take on Astrology is limiting which made the read for me more of a curious book than anything I can apply to my current studies. Nonetheless, he makes some interesting remarks regarding the two subjects. The basic premise is that the sign in which we are born in is the continuation of karmic cycles from our previous life. Thus, being born in the Ascendant of Gemini, the processes which I am working with most are of Taurean nature. Furthermore, the author suggests that if we take the time of death for a particular person and erect a horoscope at the moment of death, we can determine to some degree the kind of life the spirit will re-embody. If you are into astrology and are curious about reincarnation, this book is a good stepping stone to the subject and how to utilize information in regards to past and future lives.

To prick a thorn out of a lion's foot one will surely gain new friends and old enemies. The story of Androcles, a Christian who is about to be sent to the lions for being a heretic in the Roman Empire. A cynical, humerous, poignant, and hypocritical story of religion versus humanism. The book is intended with the introduction with Shaw's discourse on Jesus and Christianity. Although I found it dryly written, which some wit involved, he makes some good remarks on the problems of Christianity. Mainly is the devout in which they will surely go to the lions before giving up their gods. Hypocritically the Romans could care less who their gods were or whether they believed in them, so long it was not a Christian god. The introduction acts as a set-up to put one in the mind set of Shaw and to understand his point of view which makes the play that much easier to understand and funnier to read. The play itself is a wonderful entry into the classics of the thearter.

Its written with high detail and low action. Fitzgerald's now classic piece of life in the 20's set in New York, Long Island. I cant think of a more moving book than this one, however, I had realized that I felt more when I was done with book. When I had a chance to see the story as a whole that the emotions began to set in. Truly wonderful writing that is top notch among any of the writers I have read. His reading does not &quot;talk&quot; over you, but rather with you. Which is what makes the story attractive. Although many people complain about being forced to read it for school, its probably best read on your own time without constrictions. The story of Jay Gatzby, party man, millionaire, mansion owner. Everyone knows Jay. But who really knows him? Highly reccomended!

Originally published in 1929, Hall's Psychoanalyzing the Twelve Zodiacal Types is a somewhat misleading title. By reading Halls other works, one will gather he has a solid understanding of human psychology. But this book does not venture too far into the psychological world, and for the most part remains an astrology book more than a psychology book. The book is laid out typically, with each sign getting its own chapter, and in groups according to their class (i.e. cardinal, fixed, common). I feel that the descriptions for each zodiac is not too far from what you would find in other well written (and understood) astrology books. This book is concise and to the point and makes no claims of right/wrong, better/worse. The use of this book is more for those who are practicing nativities and the like and who are, perhaps, looking for an alternate means of assimilating information. The zodiacal descriptions are all based on the Sun sign which must be considered when making an accurate reading of a horoscope. While the information in the book is probably just as accurate as most other authorities, I would not say this book is a neccessity.

This 2-Volume collection published by Dover wonderfully exhibits Leonardo's works with his sketches, designs and ideas. If you ever wondered what Leonardo thought, then these are the books to get. The book is set up with the text in two columns; the left in the original Italian, and the right side in the translated English. In those words are written of Leonardo's philisophical ideas, lives of where he lived and his surroundings, his theories on color, perspective, proportion, architecture, foliage, physiology and so many other things that the Great One was curious about. Througout the book and amidst the text are Leonardos sketches, thumbnail sketches, workings of famous pieces such as the Last Supper, some anatomical drawings - and in those pages you can see Leonardo's handwriting which he tended to write backwards. The value and reference is endless, especially for the artist. This edition is reprinted from the 1833 version originally entitled &quot;Literary Works of Leonardo Da Vinci.&quot; This is a 2-volume set, which is sold seperately, but for the price, it is so worth the money. Highly reccomended!

A graphic prop book told in a prosaic vernacular of the household mechanic. 12 essays dedicated to everyday common kitchen or workbench items that brings to life the unseen or the not want to be seen. Author Morabito tells it like it is and metamorphosizes the rag into a vampiresque dependency that not just sucks, but cleans everything it touches. The knife is moved from a utensil that cuts into an imbecilic cold-hearted mystic who only moves forward without looking back and has only one pointed concentration. Each page is designed with a graphic remeniscent of medieval torture devices by Mexican graphic designer Bernardo Recaimer. As a package this book looks too enticing not to turn away, however, once one is embarked on the kitchentop journey of fancy articles into the linguistic world of poetic merchandise, one is not all that excited anymore. This book serves more as a fantasy world of Alice in the Toolshed rather than any real commentary on our kitchendary needs. After reading the first half of the selections, you will get the sense of where the author is headed (which many times the author seems to have a spontaneous direction in his writing). By the sixth essay, you will get the point very clearly that life in the kitchen happens when you are not there (or least not paying attention), which, unfortunately, the essays become somewhat repetitious thereafter. The four stars indoctrinated of this book is due to its entirely uniquness of the subject and a valid attempt at what could have been something remarkable.

Norman Kagan should get an &quot;editing&quot; credit rather than &quot;author&quot; credit. This book on the cinema of Stanley Kubrick is basically an accumulation of articles, interviews and reviews of his films and his life. Albeit some of it was interesting, the book is nothing I found original. At the end of each chapter, however, the author does take it upon himself to interpret the films in a manner in which he sees a destructive, non-sexual, non-emotional Kubrick. That of obsessive and homicidal. Attempting to make a &quot;connection&quot; in all the films which I believe is poorly attempted. I would move elsewhere to find word on Kubrick and his films.

Einstein for Beginners acts more as a visual representation of Einsteins work. An easy to read format for anyone interested in knowing Einsteins theories without the mind-boggling formulas. I would suggest this as a place to begin. A nice read, although the theories one still needs to comprehend. The author, Joseph Schwartz puts it in a perspective that both challenges and educates. Highly reccomended!

Seemingly prophetic stories of &quot;biblical&quot; proportions are trendy in the science fiction genre. With the 'Left Behind' series far ahead of many of them, you would hope people are reading these books for entertainment value and not &quot;biblical&quot; fact. One more to add is James BeauSeigneur's trilogy &quot;The Christ Clone Trilogy&quot;, with the first one here, 'In His Image'. The Story of the Shroud of Turin and the possibility that its either of Jesus, the one we know from Nazareth some 2000 years ago, or of a Knights Templar a little later in time. According to the carbon 14 dating, the Shroud enters a later period than that of Jesus Christ. But the snag here is there is some blood, a small minute drop that appears to be still living. So who's blood is it? A scientist decides to find out for himself and make a clone of the blood, and thus you have the beginnings of our story. Christopher is the product of that blood (Christ - Christopher). BeauSeigneur was a former intelligence analyst technical manuals for the military, and decided to take a swing at writing fiction. His background is fitting for the worldly affairs that take place within the political arena, however, his spiritual verse needs some discipline. While the story moves quite rapidly (time jumps in decades at a chapter), his writing does not have any life in it. Especially in the beginning of the novel which might read like some of his technical military manuals, referring to the Bible on end, DNA authorities like Francis Crick, along with the literature written on the Shroud of Turin. As the story moves past the &quot;historically&quot; accurate (speculatively interesting), and takes place in the possible future, our humble writer loses his grip on technicalities and focuses on the aim of the story. There is a lot of political jargon, so it may help to be familiar with world politics. I felt the characters were drawn two-dimensional, and the dialogue overall was flat. The book stands at 4 stars because of its informative and speculative factor as well as the main thrust of the story which is one of the better end-time stories I have come across. I look forward to reading the following sequels.

Astral traveling is becoming just the trendy thing to do on a lonely Friday night. So if you got no one to sleep with, the internet is too impersonal and expensive, well then you can astral travel and see if there is someone out there for you. The author's intention is certainly not to treat the astral plane as a dating service, but rather for the experience of losing yourself in the embracement of energy with another soul. While sex is not the same, it is a union of energy, be it atomic, molecular, or even electric. The aurhor, Marlene Marie Druhan, gives some elementary, yet clearly stated, preparations in order to achieve the out of body experience. Once this discussion is over, she moves to her experiences of astral travel, various forms of spirits and so on. To me, all of this is subjective and cannot be quantitative data as she stately puts. What she describes in some cases sound less of an astral experience and more of hallucinations. There is nothing wrong with hallucinations, however, she fails to differentiate between the astral or hallucinations. Her descriptions of possessive spirits and incubuses and succubuses seem as though the body is being pushed by other spirits own wants and desires. There is no doubt experimenting with mind expansion of any kind can be scary as it unlocks secrets chambers of the brain and body, as well as creates a unique connection with the spirit, I would hesitate to rely on Ms. Druhan's perceptions as accuate. Once we are in the astral world, there are things we can describe, however, it would be foolish to believe that others would be able to see them with you. But if you are regularly entering the Astral Plane on Friday nights, then by all means, prove me wrong. Validate what the author wrote.

Well, who could argue with the 2000 reviews before me. However, when one reads this they will know exactly how perfect this story is. Harry Potter and his unknown past abot his parents and his &quot;evil&quot; aunt and uncle who raise him. Well told in an easy format for anyone to enjoy, kids and adults alike. Potter being the most likeable character to come around in some time. From start to finish, this book is one to be treasured for quite some time. Reccommended for Everyone!

Medicine for Beginners is a historical approach rather than an aesthetic approach. It covers from whence medicine was for the shamans and healers and witch doctors. Soon, it became a practice and then a teaching and schooling. The author, although not cynical of the medicine itself, has some animosity against the trade which has become a biollion dollar a year business. Doctors has made it difficult to become a doctor (to raise prices) and insurance (to treat the rich). Since then, medicine has been really geared for those that do have money, and everyone else to pay the rest of their lives in fees (somewhat similar to the IRS and credit corps. do). Nonetheless it was a fun and easy book to read, one should not have any trouble tackling this book within a day. Out of print, it may serve as a good reference book to anyone who is reseaching medical history, but it may be somewhat out of the way as its not at the fingertips of everyone.

For fear is around the corner. For Howard Phillips Lovecraft, death was never a worry. For many of the characters in his books, death was almost a relief from the torture. It was fear and madness that was always being confronted head on. The mind of man is quite fragile when placed in situation of unexpected terror. And Charles Dexter Ward, occultist and antiquarian is no exception. Ward was a quiet man who moved into his great great grandfathers house eventually to investigate his past. Set in New England to give it the right mixture of genuine fright and eeriness. Lovecrafts masterful style, remiscent of Por, is gorgeous, rich in detail and content. Full of information on the history of New England. One can get the sense that Lovecraft knew his locales almost better than his characters. Aside from his historical geography, Lovecraft also had a very good understanding of occultism and the ancient languages of Hebrew, Latin and Greek. Well versed in many of the ancient texts. Of course, this book also brings out the controversial book the 'Necronomicon.' Some of the finest in horror written to date that will make you squeamish with fear, for the most part without the blood and guts. The imagination is more powerful than the written word, and Lovecraft knows this as well.

Noam Chomsky's book '9-11' is a relevant critique of the WTC and Pentagon disasters that will prove to be an eye opener. While I have read various bits of Chomsky's work (including a video of Chomsky's lectures), I favor his view. I have overall little interest in political science, and so much of what Chomsky brings up in this book is new to me. Yet, this did not stop me from catching the underlying theme of what Chomsky is saying: that America is, by definition, a terrorist state. This is what makes Chomsky so controversial. I believe Chomsky makes this statement purely out of objective fact of the US Code. What is purported through the media as the definition of terrorism is that which is attacked against us, or to those nations we "like." It is not a popular belief that this works the other way around. Aside from this, Chomsky addresses the the possibilities of why it happened, and what the possible consequences of "war" may be. Making many analogies to past events and relating world patterns that may prove useful in understanding our current situation. The book is short, but packs a good deal of information where little is repeated. Like most Americans, the events of September 11th had a impact that will be remembered, perhaps for the rest of your life. I highly reccomend this poignant book as it will illuminate some of the myths surrounding the events, as well as give you a keen perspective of what our country is doing without our knowledge.

One of the most famous science fiction books to date is H. G. Wells' classic War of the Worlds, which has become national paranoia in the late 30's with Orson Welles over the radio. And later in the 50's become a national hit with the movie goers. Well, neither the radio broadcast or movie rendition really took the book to its letter by letter copy, but rather improvised like most non-literal entertainers. The book begins with suspicion, suspense and wonder as a meteor passes the sky without any real notice to anyone. While the book is told in the perspective of the scientist (whose name I cant seem to recall at the moment), later, somewhere after the mid-point the gears switch and we learn what the scientists brother is doing elsewhere. For the majority of the book, once the aliens have control over the earth, which is within the first 4 chapters, things calm down and become a bit stale. Only after we come back to the scientist from the brothers story, things pick up, but mind you, they pick up slowly. I am happy I got the chance to read this book, but was a little dissapointed in how the story unfolded which is why I gave this book 4 stars. Nonetheless, certainly a required reading for science fiction fans, and even now, amongst those persuing literature.

Jewish writer and historian Elie Wisel was cut off from his childhood learning of his faith when the Nazis took him and his family away from home. Wiesel encountered a new home and new world view in which bigotry, theft, murder, and genocide existed. Wiesel's account of his experience while in the concentration camp leaves the reader on the brink of despair, which is where Wiesel had been. But perseverance and love for his father, respect and faith in his people led him away from the camp to the days of freedom only to be left with the tragic memory. That tragedy led to this compelling story of his life. Highly reccomended!!

A semi-docmentary of the life of Dan Millman with his character Dan, a young athlete in college who stumbles across a most curious gas station attendant by the name of Socrates. This book, after reading it changed my life, as well as inspired me to become a Peaceful Warrior myself. That was almost 10 years ago, but I keep coming back to it from time to time reminding myself of some of the simple pleasures in life and to remember to lose myself in the moment. The book unlocked my rigorous thinking to move on and look at things differently and more uniquely. Definately a book that is highly reccomended for anyone, but also for the beginnering philosopher to change their ways of seeng reality and life.

I was introduced to this book by a friend, bought a copy and put it down for a year. It sounded strange that a book about ancient culture of Babylon has something to say about making money. Furthermore, the back of the book purports that it is written in easy to read Biblical style language. I never found the Bible to be exactly an easy read.Nonetheless, one day I decided to read it. I was really impressed to the point of inspired! Such logical and practical sense in how to make money without first losing your shirt. In fact, you not only get to keep your shirt, but also provide shelter, clothing and food for your family on top of it! It is not worth writing the formulas or ideas in this review because it would only lose the impact. Read it so the wisdom is in it's proper context.A great book, &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;, written sometime in the early 40's, I think, continues to be an excellent resource in making money. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is having trouble saving extra for the future.

I have owned this book for quite some time and have referenced it often. It generally seemed to make sense in terms of understanding Tarot meanings and a basic foundation of learning Kabbalah. But recently, I find myself re-reading it in depth to access it better, but now find I do not agree with it as blindly as I once did.I once thought Papus (Gerard Encausse) was a pupil of Eliphas Levi, however, researching more, I realize that was not the case, but rather he was heavily influenced by Levi, and you can see that in Papus' writings. Levi wrote romantically, while Papus attempted a more serious or even "scientific" approach to the Kabbalah.This book was translated by A. E. Waite, and he does not scrutinize Papus in the way he did Levi, perhaps, because Papus wrote without any vagueness or utilize poetic devices to capture his meanings. In my opinion, Tarot of the Bohemians serves as a sloppy translation to 'Dogma and Ritual of High Magic' peppered with Theosophy and other ideas from his order of the Martinists. The result is, what I feel, one of the best laid out structures of learning the Tarot via the Kabbalah that I could find today.Most Tarot books seem to just get to the meanings of the cards and assert no justification of where the meanings come from, and this probably irks me more than anything about Tarot books. Papus starts from the seed of all things based within the Hebrew letters, specifically starting with the YOD, the sperm of all that follows. After spelling out the Tetrgrammaton and explaining its attributions, he would apply numbers to them and the positions would have their meanings until we understood clearly how 1, 2, 3 and 4 all have their part with YHVH.Then we get to what is called "Theosophic Reduction and Addition". This is simple math that any 4 year old should be able to do. 1+2=3. Yet, Papus attributes meanings to these to help develop the symbolism. So Theosophic Reduction is done simply, if you have a number, say, 10, then to reduce it is to simply add the 1+0=1. Easy enough. So a reduction is, to my understanding to reduce the value to less than 10 to have a single number, and furthermore, to reduce it to 4 or less as all numbers are made up from the 1 (even 4, which is 1+2+3+4=10=1+0=1). You might be wondering what I did. If you missed it, well, Papus sometimes meanders over points thoroughly from chapter to chapter, while other stuff he seems to skirt through fairly quickly. Theosophic Addition is to extrapolate the number from 1 to the number in question. So 4 becomes 1+2+3+4. The answer is not 10, but 1 because he reduces the 10. I am not sure why he does this, and he does not answer for large numbers like 26, which equals 340. So am I to reduce this? 3+4+0=7. Then do I add this? 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28=2+8=10=1. Ok. It all seems to work. But when you play with numbers in this manner, it seems like you can get lost with no apparent rhyme or reason. It becomes busy work for the mind. If I decided to take 26 and just reduce it as 2+6=8, then add that as 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36=3+6=9=?? If you take 9, add it, it gives you 45, so, now you are in a loop of 9's. If anyone understands this better and I missed something, please step forward and explain it to me. I feel I have understood it well enough to take it at face value and move on.Ultimately, what you need to know is that 4 and 1 are the same, in that 4 becomes 1 both mathematically (as explained above) and symbolically, as 4 becomes a transcendant number that takes the place of 1. So, for instance, the card Ace, two, three, the fourth card is a mirror of the Ace, but in lesser form. So the card is a transition card from one plane or world to another. And when you have gone through the cards, it leaves with the 10 card, which is the transition card to the next suit. And final suit card (the 10 of coins), becomes the transition card to the Major Arcana.Whether you agree that the Trumps come first or the Minors are, more or less, irrelevant, but rather the the system that Papus builds up is a logical one and can be followed well enough.Papus is thorogh and goes over his points again and again, so by the time you are done with the Minor Arcana, you have a pretty solid understanding of what he is getting at. It can be confusing at times because it breaks down into multitudes of groups of 4's stemming from the original YHVH. So yes, it is a different approach from the modern traditional mapping onto the Tree of Life, the 10 sephira. Papus does not even attribute the four elements, which is surprising considering Eliphas Levi emphasized those well in his book.When he gets into the Major Arcana, similar explanations come through, with the exception these are done with terniaries, or Triads rather than Quadrants. But the premise is the same, the fourth card is the transition card. So you would have Magus, Empress, High Priestess as your triad, and the Emperor becomes the transition card to the next realm.His Tarot attributes leave a little to be desired in the way of his describing of symbolism. His organization at this stage does not come across as clean or as well developed as the previous part of the book. Following the Major cards, he explores more of the cards as a totality. Then some articles from Stanlislas de Guaita, and Ch. Barlet, along with applications of the Tarot and various other symbolism.In sum, I find the book value in its basic principles of building up a symbolic foundation for the Minor cards specifically, and perhaps to draw some base ideas for the Trumps, but ultimately, the writing is never interesting or has a narrative that draws you in. Contradictory to the organization he placed on learning of the Kabbalistic Tarot, the book itself needs better organization.Being as it is, the book has been an influential piece in the history of Tarot and Papus has made a major contributions in both occultism and Tarot that you cannot ignore it entirely.

The set up of a horror or thriller, such as ATM, is probably one of the most important parts of the film. You can expect a chase, gore scenes, some monstrosity's, and if time permits, character development. So here we have two seemingly successful people working in finance who leave a party to bring home a good looking woman, who also works with them. One of the guys needs to stop at an ATM to get money for his late night munchies.The film seems to be set in the city. New York City (or at least something like to NYC). But apparently the only ATM is on this remote street with no one around. Pulling up to the ATM, he parks, what seems like a half a block away. Why not just pull right up to it?? I don't know anyone that does this, especially at 1 in the morning. And so, between the car and the ATM hut stands the killer. And yes, they all forgot their cell phones in the car.I just get infuriated how people find themselves in situations like this. It could be argued on the other side that what are the chances of some crazy guy looking to kill some people locked in an ATM hut. But err on the safe side when the chances are higher that strange people creep around at night in big cities. Ultimately, however, it just seems too convenient for the killer to get into place.The film does not offer much other than high tension. As the other reviewers mentioned, the question of "why" is never answered. Clearly it is not supposed to. I am not sure if thats the question the film is offering either. I think its more stating that "it can be done". If we recall the opening credit sequence, we see maps and diagrams and coordinates. All of this for the killer as a challenge for technology.I am probably being more poetic than the film deserves, but its a measure of avoidance as the film has little substance to work with. Anything revealed gives away almost too much. I can only assume that the film was green lit based on a pitch and wasn't developed further.Now that I have my gripes out of the way, I will say that the film is well done and the drama is exciting and intense. The acting is credible and well executed, so that's a bonus. It is worth a rental, but not at the current price. I would wait for the actual DVD release. It was exciting and entertaining, but the lack of the depth the film has, I cannot merit it more than 2 stars.

I can remember, before I read this book about 5 years ago, growing up always seeing this book lying around my house. Of course at the time I never inquired as to what it was, I just saw it all the time. I always associated it with some Christian book of inspiration that my father was reading, which is why I never bothered to look at it.After reading this, however, I was truly amazed with the story. I knew I knew it. I mean, the story was entirely familar. Like most people growing up in a Christian household they are likely to hear the story of Jesus. Either from their parents, church or wherever. This book surprised me with the parallel to Jesus' own life. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who knew he something better to do than just eat. So he flew higher and higher and came down faster and faster. He was learning. He was experiencing.Soon, after being kicked out of his own lang and meeting some very wise Gulls. They taught him perfect speed. It was some time before I understood what this meant. But I found out one day at an Ani DiFranco concert (learning is everywhere around you). Someone said that she was the fastest female metal guitarist, or something or other. It dawned on me then what perfect speed was. Its not the speed, its not the height, but the quality. In a word: now.At any rate, this book was one of the books that really inspired me, for many things outside of it just being a Jesus parallel. It inspired me to know that we all have more to do with our time than to work to make money to eat (ad infinitum). One of the great books of its day. Highly reccomended for those who love good stories. (Oh, by the way - if you loved this story and thought you might want to see the movie. Dont! You will be utterly bored, especially by Neil Diamonds droning terrible songs in which a short book is made into a 2 hour live rendition. A complete let down, not to mention a waste of a film).

Famed psychiatrist R. D. Laing gives a study of eleven families and thier children whom are schizophrenic. Laing gives no interjections, but rather lets the conversations that the families have amongst themselves give their own testimony. Laing lets the reader know where language patterns occur, in which he believes is largely due to the psychic split. The &quot;double bind&quot; theory introduced by Gregory Bateson, in which the child has been given mixed messages. In the cases given, the studies are all female, and the mothers are usually the aggressor, while the father the passive, and if other siblings are included, they usually side with the mother against the sibling. Shocking, sad and enlightening all together, Laing gives a great look on how schizophrenic in this light can and does occur. Highly reccomended and should be read by all psychologists entering or in the field (it is a shame that this book, like so many of R.D. Laings books are out of print). One should include with this book Gregory Batesons &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot; which includes the essay which explains the &quot;double bind.&quot;

That is to say there are logical means to schizophrenia, and nothing that confers to a physical disability. An amazing study of eleven families and the children who are hospitalized because of their &quot;illness&quot; (incidentally noted, they are all female patients). Dr. Laing and Dr. Esertons account of schizophrenia all points to the facts that this mental illness is not a physical impairment, but a distrust in a persons reality, through communication, through insecurity of beliefs and senses. Schizophrenics choose logically and intelligently under the confines of family life with the parents (who are more delussional than the patient). Although this book is primarily a psychological study, it reads like a novel.

Johnson's use of mythology and retelling the myths I find exciting, simple and understandable. He is certainly talking to the 'Everyman' where psychology may not be a prominant part in their lives, yet believes there are men and women out there looking to change internally. Explaining the Fisher King story from the Arthurian legends, Johnson demonstrates the stories ability of how man, or the masculine aspect of the psyche goes through transformation from a little boy holding on to mommy, to a man, and what it means to be a man, which is not in the traditional '50's 'man-of-the-house' type.

An introduction to the Kabbalah, although kept simple, it remains as nothing mysterious. Rabbi Kushner gives some relevant examples to our time, however, I feel there is something missing in the whole of the study of the Kabbalah. Nicely presented and displayed with pictures, this short book is just an introduction that, because its so short, it misses many of its aspects.

Ok, I watched all of the Sex and the City seasons. The first season is still the best, then progressively gets worse. While this movie might be "long-awaited" it is also too late for any good to come of it. The film itself was virtually a paid advertisement and is also was a complete mess, ruined by the simple fact that the story was over before it began.The film begins with a reiteration of the TV shows "funny" highlights to get people emotionally engaged into the world of Carrie and her friends again. Once the story gets going we soon realize that Carrie and Big have not tied the knot. So now we know the major plot of the movie. Because of this we know one of them will have some sort of commitment issue and post pone the wedding. Big surprise.Along with this, all of the girls have their own trite issues all at the same time over stupid stuff. I have resolved, at this point, that these girls are certifiably insane. None of them deserve the relationships they have, nor do they know how relationships work. They react way off the handle over a single and incidental flaw or behavior from their guys, and they shun them for months on end! These girls are some of the most irrational beings portrayed on television.This movie is only a testament to their insanity. To further this problem, the studio decided to release an Extended Version which closes nearly on the 3-hour mark! Watching this movie, I was thinking to myself, "When will this movie end?!?" It just goes on and on with no funny moments whatsoever. I feel like all of the humor is dated because the show has been off the air for like 5 years now. Although the girls have good chemistry, its really not enough to make this a likable movie. Its a waste of time on their part, the film crews part, and an insult to the audience to feel that we need this movie in our lives. The fact that a 150-minute version exists is testimony to how much bad footage exists and that they had no idea of where the movie was headed from the beginning. So I say, even if you are a fan of the show, do not ruin the memory by watching this movie. It will really make you resent the show and its characters. The TV show ended well and appropriately, and now they are beating a dead horse. Do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. If you enjoy watching insane women over react to small things, watch The L-Word, at least there you will get lots and lots of nudity among the craziness.

This book, while being a psychology book, is not for psychologists. Its essentially for everyone else; for all those whom deem themselves creative but dont know how to create. The title 'Courage to Create' epitomizes the core understanding of what is true creativity. In a nutshell, author Rollo May explains that to have courage is to move forward &quot;in spite of despair.&quot; This is where creativity is borne out of: out of despair. May then cites many examples of artists, mathematicians, musicians, and other forms where creative thought can be applied. He does not give the read a step by step process in how one can apply techniques, but empowers the reader with an attitude. The attitude of perseverance, encounter relationship, and expression of the deepest levels of our psyche. To be in constant search of ourselves is to be, in one sense, in despair and yet, to challenge that deparity is to have the courage. And by expressing that challenge, one begins to understand creativity. When we have worked and overworked ourselves, then frustration ensues where we leave our work. In this silence, our unconscious is still at work. Then we look bright-eyed and say 'Aha!'. We have created. Author May also includes other aspects that will be helpful to the reader in gaining more awareness and insight to anxiety levels and what the artist may be suppressing emotionally or cognitively. A wonderful book I highly reccomend that will challenge your limitations.

This little book, although only 62 pages, is chock full of information. Setting out from the consonantal alphabets of Proto-Sinitic forms and Ugaritic taking you through time to Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Arabic, which seem to be derived from the ancient Semetic languages of East and West and the devleopment of vowels. The book is filled with many pictures and diagrams of alphabets from ancient cultures, which help the clarity. Although the book is filled with good information, dont let the size fool you. There are lots of different lanugages and alphabets here with many names to remember. Its not exciting reading, mostly scholarly text and not any narrative to help the reader along. While this is a good book for someone who already has some knowledge of historical alphabets, I would not suggest this as an intro. Reccomended to those that already have an introuctory course in linguistics and historical alphabets.

Director Robert Hall (LIGHTNING BUG), brings you this piece of carnage, LAID TO REST. The set up is a young woman, (Bobbi Sue Luther), who plays the anonymous 'Girl'. She wakes up to find herself in a casket, not knowing who she is or where she is. She is obviously frightened and searches for a way out. She finds a phone and calls 911, which immediately connects her to the local police. When Girl could not provide information for her location, they tell her to hold on so they could trace the call. But she is captivated by something and walks towards it. Meanwhile holding the phone and, stretching further than the cords limits, ends up yanking the phone out of its socket. Fortunately for her she is unaware and never realizes the full potential of this misstep. Although the audience is firmly made aware of this, the story never makes any use of it and the character never responds to the matter either, so there was little reason for it to happen. She then sees someone through a door window. He is the funeral home caretaker who is getting his keys to open the door. The killer is behind him and kills him from behind. Soon, she escapes by squeezing through the victim and the killer to the outside world.And thats the set up on this one. There is a killer on the loose who is after the Girl and we are left in the dark about who he is. The film, sadly, never lets us in who anyone is, what their motivations are or why they are being stalked or why they are stalking. The film just wants to be a blood bath without justification. Which is fine on its own merits, but, if that were the case, there is not any style or substance to speak of.One of the major problems I had with the film was the editing. It was way too fast and even the simplest dialogue scenes had about 6 edit cuts which made me think these actors are worse than what you are seeing. There is a difference between editing to cover a mistake, and editing for style, and you can tell the difference. There was no finesse or planning in the edits, but they seemed to be cover-ups. And with so many edits throughout the movie, it had no flow, no pacing or rhythm and no real rest spots. There is probably one good shot I can comment on which was important that they gave you about 2 minutes to relax. It was a long shot from the top of the roof down to one of the characters on the ground and a car pulls up shortly after. Well done. Everything else was hurried.Now, the killer in this movie is known as Chrome Skull. Not one that will go down in the books next to Jason or Michael. He is chasing The Girl with his super-duper sharp knife which, he must have bought off the Home Shopping Network because this thing can slice through anything! In fact, it can slice skulls in half by a quick flick of the wrist. I dont think Ginsu ever made a knife this sharp.The characters in the film are all weak and moronic. No one has any backbone. No one has any good or memorable lines. They just read through them with strained emotions that is painful to watch. Terrible! In addition, film does try to clue us in on the characters. We get a glimpse into the Girl's past and we get tidbits of info on who the killer is. None of this adds up to anything, so what we are left with is a pair who probably belong together more than the film is willing to show us. The killer does not kill her (hah, no pun there). The kill wants her to live, but we dont know why. We think the Girl wants to find out who she is, but she does not. Well, when she does, it tells us nothing about her relationship to the killer. So its all pointless as to why we need to know who they are. Ultimately, all of the acting is terrible and with poorly developed characters, there is little for the actors to work with.There is tons of gore in this film, even if its not very good gore, its still there. At least they used real special effects and not CGI. But again, the editing makes the gore look bad and obvious. It was as if they person is fine one second, and then next second they have a slash the size of Texas across their chest. So, some of the logical leaps in frames need work. Although there is lots of gore, there is no nudity. It could have used some, but I suppose if I were the girl, and I read this script, I would save that honor for a more deserving film. But if I were the director, I would want someone to get naked to give this film some redemption.Despite all of the atrociousness that makes this film one of the worst films I have seen this year, it could have been pulled off if it included one quality: Anticipation. There is not one moment where I could see the action in advance that would prepare me for the scare. Everything just sort of happens. No warning. So when someone is killed, you have no idea where it comes from, who did it, or what exactly is getting cut. All you are left with is a bloody mess. So it totally diminishes the scare factor and even the horror factor in this film. I was not scared nor squeamish because I had too many questions. So, it goes without saying that this movie, because it lacks the anticipation for any set up kill, it ends up being pointless. As I said, even if the film just likes the gore factor, you still need to give people some information about what is 'going' to happen just as much as what 'is' happening.Also things like the technology are anachronistic in this film. The first phone in the film was a wall hanging phone (they still make those?). But the killer has a super duper cell phone that has speaking text! (Also the killer has this wickedly awesome car which totally takes him out of contention for classic killer). And the internet almost seems archaic the way it is handled in this film. There was no continuity of time as it seemed technology was coming from all different periods of time. Oh yeah! And the killer walks around with a video camera on his shoulder to record all of his killings (what!?). Yep! And get this - although he has the latest cell phone technology, and a great looking car, his video camera still uses tape! Umm, what happened to digital? So, again, technology is not consistent.Overall the film does not take you anywhere. Even in the final moments, which is one of the most anti-climactic horror endings in all of horror films, because the Girl is never redeemed! Why oh why did they do that!?!??!? I suppose that was the icing on this cake. It really was a dead film at that point.LAID TO REST is from Anchor Bay Entertainment, who, since being bought out by Starz, has declined in their releases of quality horror films. This film is no different and should be taken very lightly. You can certainly have fun with your friends laughing and making fun of it as you watch, but I dont think you would want to own it afterwards. Best is to rent it with some friends and enjoy it.

Although the book is about Witchcraft, Magic and the Occult, as one browses through it one should immediately notice it acts more as a reference guide rather than any formal history. Crow gives capsulated accounts of, not just the title words, but any type of secret society, paranormal experience to ancient wonders and ancient history like cave men and apes and evolution. Why this has anything to do with the title is beyond me to answer. Very little references to go by with seemingly overall irrelevant information, or the information is generalized to the point of irrelevancy. There are so many books on withcraft, magic and occultism among the other subjects mentioned on the book that I would hardly reccomend this to anyone - not even as a beginner or starter book.

Fabulous work on learning what rapport is, as well as how to establish rapport with just about anyone at anytime. The book not only is a useful guide for communication, but also acts as a great precursor to Bandler and Grinder's work 'The Structure of Magic' (or Frogs Into Princess or Trance-formations) as well as Ericksonian Hypnosis. Simple and well presented, Jerry Richardson explains different aspects of rapport in a clear and simple style with short and practicle chapters from simple pacing to dealing with resistence. Teaches you how to read body language and tools such as anchoring. An excellent book and highly reccomended for anyone thats looking for a place to start in the field of hypnotherapy or NLP.

I actually thought this was gonna be a funny film making fun of Zak and the boys on the Ghost Adventures show. It opens with the premise of a guy who narrates our way into the "recorded footage". You see them pay off some guy to say there were ghosts, the theatrics they place to make the non-happenings as exciting. As the film progressed, I had realized they were not spoofing the show at all, but it starts to really get creepy. I think thats what made it scarier for me was that I was expecting to laugh.But whats starts as little incidents of rappings, lights going on and off and the usual "what was that!?" hysteria. But then the s**t really starts to hit the fan and it becomes unrelentless. Some of the logic gets thrown askew for scare tactics, and if you are critical of the human response factor to a situation such as this, then it might take away some of the appreciation of the scares. The one criticism I have of ALL found footage film is the inability to let go of the camera for any reason. So much so that people will die holding it. I dont get the impression is used only for a light source.It takes place in an abandoned mental hospital (of course!) And like all abandoned mental hospitals, bad things have happened there and have left an indelible scar upon its psyche. So, now the ghosts who were once patients run the asylum and are more mad than they were in life.There are lots of cameras and I must have missed some of the set up, but there seems to be lots of angles besides the single camera.The "apparitions" manifest are not really ghosts, but seems physical and demonic beings of a sort. So I am not sure what they are. Despite these logical loopholes, there are some very good special effects and a bigger budget is at hand than it might appear.Overall, I found this a very good scare film in the vain of Paranormal Activity and the like, but I actually find this one scarier and unsuspecting. .Recommended!!

A book about Anybody for Somebody and tales and trials of Someone looking for Something in a land that is Anywhere, but we all have been there, I am not sure where, but its Somewhere. Anywho, Bandler also tells the story of Something in search of Anything that is Anything, and makes you wonder what that Thing is and if its Nothing or Everything. Yet, upon finishing this book, I found Somehow Something kept me reading about Anybody. Anyhow, its a fun book that goes Nowhere and Everywhere for Anyone.

I love Alan Watts' writing. He makes you feel warm, like part of the family, but does not talk down to you like a parent. This book, written in 1940, is one of his earlier works, and you can sense he is still formulating his style. While sometimes scholarly, and other times playful, he mixes the right amount of both perspectives to give the reader a profound sense of being alive. The book is called &quot;The Meaning of Happiness&quot;. While we all have at some point experienced happiness, Watts explores the meaning of what happiness is and how might it be experienced more than a transitory feeling. Happiness is defined essentially as &quot;libertaion,&quot; where one no longer has the need to be happy, or need to be mad or need be anything exept to be. In a round about way it is enlightenment (or enlightenment is happiness). In Watts' calssical style, there is no progression one must endure, it just happens. It happens as easily looking with ones eyes. This is not the happiness that we coined in &quot;dont worry be happy&quot; because this presumes that one has to worry in order to be happy. It is not the, in order to experience happiness we must experience sadness. It is the &quot;transcendence of opposites&quot;. To dispute the Buddha's &quot;all things are sorrow,&quot; Watts says all things are happy.

An autobiography of Inner Space is indeed what is happening here. Dolphin researcher turned consciousness explorer reaches heights that Timothy Leary so much admired about him. The book journeys from his youth to his research days at the dolphin labs and his scientific and personal discoveries and relays them to the reader in such humbleness that one cant help but to empathize and rejoice in his discoveries. Once his dolphin research was abolished, he took it upon himself to turn to neurology and neurological drugs, i.e. LSD-25, or as they called it &quot;Pure Sandoz.&quot; It is here where his naieve approach to drugs really comes out in his writing, as he was not afraid of them, but also had never tried them (LSD in particular). Lilly read everrything he could on LSD before trying it (study before trial, similar to magic and all forms of initiation. Today with psychedelic drugs illegalized almost everywhere in the world (a conspiracy if you ask me), Lilly never condones this method (drugs) to attain self knowledge. Lilly in his deep moments of self reflection and depression understood that it could be achieved through other means without drugs. From here, is where he finalizes his journey. A marvelous book, unfortunately now its out of print, however, if you should find a copy, it would be worth your while to pick it up. I am also assuming you are somewhat familiar with John Lilly, either through Professor Leary or Robert Anton Wilson, in which it will not be a waste of a purchase.

Crowley is perhaps giving an aphoristic title to his work in a similar manner as McLuhan and Leary has done in more recent times. An evocative slogan that can spin many ideas and interpretations. The question then being, &quot;Who is All?&quot; Also, &quot;What is the Law?&quot; And if you get that far, then you might ask, &quot;Who's Law?&quot; One might answer very literally and find that not All people agree with Crowley's thinking. Also, if this is Crowley's own Laws, then they are for him and not me. Another might answer in an equally esoteric manner and say &quot;You&quot; to all questions.This book is a commentary by Crowley himself on his own worshipped book &quot;Liber Legis&quot;, better known as &quot;The Book of the Law.&quot; For those that study Crowley with seriousness, intensity and repetitiously will find &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; in almost every text bearing Crowley's name to the point of exhaustion. While &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; is an important book in uncovering many of Crowley's meanings and points of view, it would appear he was creating a fellowship around something that should have been more personal.&quot;The Law is For All&quot;, however, offers select insight into &quot;The Book of the Law.&quot; The rest of it is work for the reader. It is not something in plain English for one to say &quot;ohhhh!&quot; after they are done reading it. It is still kept in the traditional kabbalistic coded framework for those that have already done their homework or is willing to put forth the work.&quot;The Law is For All&quot; is not an esssential guide to understanding &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, yet, can aid towards understanding Crowley's take on his experience, but I would believe that interpretation does not stop at Crowley's word. For me performing the rituals offered in other books has given me the greatest insight to &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; while &quot;The Law is For All&quot; only gives partial intellectual clues.&quot;The Law is For All&quot; then is really not for &quot;All&quot;, at least in the literal sense. I believe he was saying &quot;All&quot; meaning everyone should adhere to what was written in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, however, I also believe he was referring to the &quot;All&quot; as in the &quot;You&quot; or, rather, &quot;All of You.&quot; The &quot;Law&quot; is what is written on your heart. This book is for those that are interested in Crowley more than in Magick, in my opinion.

Robert Anton Wilson's screenplay which he attempted to have produced in a film is about the adventures of a scientist who Flashes back on LSD and experiences future memory blocks. Eventually time and space skip from one place to another to an ending I will not reveal here. Entertaining and a well written script, however, I can understand why Hollywood passed the idea. Scattered somewhat, however visually appealling it may be (even to the unconscious). More likely a better read, nonetheless, Wilson is Wilson, so if you enjoy reading Wilson, then this Wilson will be good enough for you.

Andreus Vesalius, whom I speculate was a student of Da Vinci, shows the body in all sorts of poses, while in each page you see the body &quot;drips&quot; off its skin and muscles all the way down to the bones. Some masterful work and imagination employed here! Just marvelous! Taken from his monumental work De Humani Corporis Fabrica, which is still used today in the medical fields. Also included are plates from his Epitome of the De Humani Corporis Fabrica and Tabulae Sex. Essentially this is only the illustrations, but it also includes a lengthy introduction as well as excerps from the original text. Highly reccomended to the art student and medical student for this indispensible reference. Also a great book just to appreciate some amazing art. Some of my favorite plates are of the nervous sytem in which it is a full body posed standing upright. I imagine how Andreas created this, and also realized how well he must have known the body's anatomy in order to attempt such a feat. Awesome!

Author Errol Selkirk wrote the historical perspective of sex in literature. Also prescribing different beliefs of the different times throughout history from the Dark Ages to the Information Age. Running over sex theories of Freud and Reich and loking into the works of Marquis DeSade. A fun and easy book to read, however there are some dry spots that one will come across. Reccomended to those reading the wonderful series by Writers and Readers Beginners Books.

James Joyces lesser known poetry is interesting when comparing his literary works of Finnegans Wake and Portrait of a Young Man. This book has 3 sets of poems, the first is called &quot;Chamber Music.&quot; Its made up of 36 short poems in which Joyce shows love gained and love lost. I particularly enjoyed this series because each poem is either of the lady or man speaking in a musical tone, alternately, page by page. Later after these were published a few musicians put them to actual music which apparently made Joyce quite happy. The second set, titled &quot;Pomes Penyeach,&quot; are appearingly random, although they seem to go together in a strange way when you read them. The last poem, titled &quot;Ecce Puer&quot; about the birth of his grandson and the death of his father. Very moving how in a few words Joyce gives out his feelings of happyness, sadness and somewhat resentment. Simple describes best this set of poems that Joyce collected in his early years of writing, which Chamber Music is the first work of Joyce to actually appear in print. Certainly a good addition to any Joyce lover as well as one who love poetry.

The movie that caught my attention of the medium of film that transcended entertainment as just a means of storytelling to a level of art equal to any piece of artwork or classic literature. The sheer beauty and majesty that takes your breath away through the visually dynamic composition Kubrick displays; with his keen eye for design, shape, color, movement and sound, all working together as a whole. The story is quite abstract and esoteric in many ways, but one is forgiving and understanding when they &quot;feel&quot; this film through sound and motion. The story may be interpreted in many ways, and has been done so offers symbolic spirituality, the dual between man and manchine, the origins of man and where he is going through space and time. Definately Kubrick's masterpiece as well as groundbreaking in Hollywood cinema. The DVD version is incredible with the sound. The extras are ok. A trailer, and a 9-minute lecture by A.C. Clark. I would like to have seen something with Kubrick. However, the movie is plenty.

Because of the broad scope of philosophy, one does not know where to begin in the subject. This book is a great place to start for it gives a historical overview of philosophy and its philosophers. Starting from the ancient Greeks all the way to Structuralism. Giving short and concise prescriptions of different philosophers of all the major and most influential subjects. From existentialism to the sophists to the age of reason and phenomenology. Highly reccomended for those just getting into philosophy and looking for a place to start.

One of Spielberg's best films, his next blockbuster as the follow-up to Jaws. Close Encounters, about a man (Dreyfuss) and a few others all have a calling to meet at Devil's Mountain where they will meet extra-terrestrials. Some of the best scenes full of intesity made whole with John Williams awesome score. The final scenes are some of the most memorable, and the best special effects you will see in modern cinema (comparatively so with CGI). Spielberg also wrote the script, along with a cameo of famed French director Francois Truffaut.

Piers Bizony's great work in putting the pieces together of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. Probably one of the most complex look at any film that I have come across in full detail. The book is in large format with slick pages and color photos everywhere to give you a behind the camera view of the work being accomplished. This book is highly reccomended for film students, movie lovers and Stanley Kubrick fans.

Bergman's classic masterpiece and the film that propelled him into the international spotlight. The symbolic film of a knight just coming back from the end of the Crusades finds himself face to face with Death. Antonius Bloc, played by Max Von Sydow, decides to try and outwit Death by playing a game of chess; who shall win determines the fate of Antonius Bloc. This film, however great, is not for the Hollywood types. Its Swedish and black and white (which looks wonderful in this transfer). The Criterion Edition features commentary by film historian Peter Cowie, a Bergman specialist. An annotated and illustrated filmography. Original Theatrical trailer abd options for sound and language. My motto is always get the Criterion cause you will get the highest quality available, and most likely more extras. However, Seventh Seal remains as one of the pinnacles in the history of cinema that one can hardly be faulted for lack of extras, for the film stands so tall on its own.

Eaweard Muybridges work after his success with Animals in Motion, logically would pursue humans doing tasks that would allow us to view humans in motion.With about 4700 photos in this collection, larger than the animals collection, you will see men, women and children doing just about everything short of coition. All models are nude, running, skipping, jumping, carrying pails of water. This collection by Dover, one of the finest publishers around, is a great reference for all artists, especially animators. As it can show them the muscles and movements and positions of weight, balance, footing, head movements and expressions to gain an edge on their drawings for more accuracy. The Walt Disney Animation Studios reading list highly reccomends this collection for every prospective animator.

I have read about 25 of these Beginners book by Writers and Readers, and have thoroughly enjoyed them, regardless of whether I liked one better than the other, or found one a bit more shallow. Unlike the other books, the History of Cinema for Beginners gives a full course on the introduction towering the other Beginner Books at 375 pages. Which is quite a book for beginners. As a typical cinema history book would begin, at the beginning with the pre-projectors of the Zoetrope and the MAgic Lantern. The from Edison to the Lumiere Brothers. Once passing into the wave of cinema and displaying the revolutonaries of Eisenstein and Griffith. The sorting into sections, coutries and movements. This book covers not just cinema, but also foreign cinema, America, Russian and just about every country that released a film. Maybe a bit overwhelming for beginners as the juxtaposition of movements, countries and styles may seem all too confusing. The author, Jarek Kupsc, may have wanted to express his depth of knowledge within the world of cinema, and came off a bit brash. Yet, besides this detail, I found this text complete in its account for the history of cinema. There is nothing new in this book that one will not find in other cinema history books, however for the beginner, this may be the route to go in the end.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and found the writing easy to get along with as its written in narrative form that. Anthropologist Jeremy Narby steps off the plane and into Amazonian country. Here he tries the commonplace hallucinagenic ayahuasca. This plant gives Narby incredible insight into the human soul, body and nature of life. The author then gives his experience in as much detail as he could remember, then passing along the rest of his trip with conversations and whatnot. From here, he sets out to write his book. Although the author does sort of jump to conclusions that the double serpents he sees all over ancient mythology is the double helix of DNA (i.e. the medical symbol caduceus). Although in some cases I tend to agree with his point of view, and I find much of the ancient symbols of the past to correlate strongly with our modern psychology, mathematical sciences and biology. However, in his search, he does not let go of the idea, which may or not not help his cause. The book would have received 5 stars, if he stayed on top of his subject. He began with hallucinagenics in the Amazon, then to DNA, then neurology and smoking ingredients. He writes humbly knowing what he believes wont be taken to heart very lightly. There are no answers in this book, however many questions, pertinent questions no less, which makes this such a valuble and enjoyable book. Definately reccomended. Fans of Joseph Campbell may really enjoy this one.

I have seen the Stanley Kubrick film of the same title hundreds of times before I decided to read the book. As the opening credits in the film state, &quot;Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke&quot;. Because the movie and the book were written simultaneously, I never thought the book would be much different. Once I began reading, however, I was stunned at how wrong I was, where in fact there was more than I dreamed of. What the movie could not convey, or maybe even did not want to convey was exposed in the writing. Clarke writes with clarity and passion; not just for writing, but also science as a means of expressing ones own existence. That existence being the ultimate question of man's relationship with the universe and the environment he has created for himself. The book is existential as well as mystical: scientific as well as theological: revaltory as well as inquisitive. The story follows the same track as the movie, yet with inner dialogue of the apes on Earth and their first meeting with the Black Monolith, describing how the impact of this clean, smooth, black mystery impacted their means of survival through the use of weaponry and tools. Following some 2001 years later into deep space towards Jupiter we meet H.A.L., another enigma that similarly impacts man and his ability to control his fate or destiny. For anyone who has seen the movie, the book will not surprise you as far as the generic structure of the story, yet Clarke's handling of the subject completely unknown at the time is simply startling.Published in 1968 (a year before landing on the moon), Clarke dedicates this book to Stanley Kubrick. Likewise, Kubrick made a similar gesture with his film. This new edition includes some thoughts on the year 2001, as well as a small write-up on his relationship with Stanley. Highly reccomended.

McLuhan extends his famous aphorism &quot;medium is the message&quot; into the Mess-age of high technology, electricity, light and all forms of media past and present. Citing references from Coomaraswamy, James Joyce and Eckhardt. Although not a scholarly piece like his other works, this &quot;experiment&quot; of the printed picture is undoubtedly one of McLuhans most influential works. McLuhan takes out the words and attempts to create a &quot;televisionesque&quot; montage demonstrating the effects of the media. Brilliant work!

Manly Hall's book on the hidden destiny of america is a well written and easy to read book of America as the Neoplatonic Utopia. Citing from rare and obscure references you will discover some amazing ideas of a land not born in history until some 500 or more years later. The book starts out in Ancient Egypt with Aknaten, as he declares the first democrat. Hall then states that the Greeks did at one time sail to America and got as far as the Great Lakes. The book also deals largely with prophecies. That of Atlantis, Nastradamus, Lord Bacon, Plato, and other more 'silent' prophets. The one particular aspect of this book that I really enjoyed is that Manly Hall really appreciates books and knowledge. He values them to the utmost degree (see his Great Books on Religion and Esoteric Philosophy). In the course of this literature he states that its not the facts that matter, but rather there is another point of view of history that we may not be aware of. This is just another one and to take it as gosepel truth is to miss the point entirely. Its to keep our imagination rolling and our eyes open that we can see the [personal] utopia. He goes on saying that America is the lost Utopia, or the never found utopia that so many people have been searching for or speculating in theory. Among the famous people that founded this country of whom all of which were involved in Freemasonry or other Secret Occult Societies. Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and perhaps even Christopher Columbus. It is clear Manly P. Hall knows his materials and the content within them. Highly reccomended for anyone learning about utopias, American history, Manly Hall readers, Freemasonry and Secret Society.

Dr. Timothy Leary's book 'The Game of Life' (Part 4 of his Future-History Series) is by far one of his best and most accessible. Although, like most of his books, they are chaotic and disorganized and for the most part confusing, this book catergorizes Leary's own philosophy into the scientific-occult world of Aleister Crowley and Tarot. Leary begins with evolution and Darwin, along with Mendeleyev and his classification of chemical elements. Along with neurological thoughts of the nervous system, DNA, synaptic connections, I-Ching and Hindu Mythology. This is the first part, which may seem random and non-linear, he eventually connects all of this to the system of Tarot, which is the ancient occult divination practice in which picture symbols unconsciously give your brain suggestions in e-volving your DNA consciousness while in-volving your body/mind circuitry. Highly regarding Aleister Crowley's work in his &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; and his own Tarot deck, he understands that Crowley was on a similar path, only using different language. The second part is a chapter dedicated to each Tarot card alloting it its own intelligence in the chain of evolutionary process. Leary does expand the set giving it 24 major cards instead of the standard 22. An excellent book and highly reccomended to all!. At first glance this book may look like an issue of Mad Magazine, but once studied and practiced, it all comes together. Although its hard to appreciate on its own, I would suggest reading Crowley's own &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; along with it. Also reccomended is Leary's &quot;Info-Psychology&quot; in which he explains the 24 neuro-circuits more scientifically. And for an even more accessible view and understanding of Leary's 24 neuro-circuits is Robert Anton Wilson's &quot;Prometheus Rising.&quot; These books together will give you a 3-Dimensional understanding and insight into the wisdom of the body/brain. This book also has contributiuons by R. A. Wilson.

Italian author Palazzini covers the Coca-Cola history in this short biography of a soft drink. Interesting and has fun facts, but from what understand the Coca-Cola mythology has been skewed in recent times. Yet, this little factoid does not take away from the rest of the book which looks at, with pictures, Coca-Colas merchandising effort from collectible bottles, slogans, advertisements and anything else that can be sold to the public. A good book for a beginner in advertising and an interest in Coca-Cola, as well as the collector.

Is there a devil on your back thats been hounding you to learn those numbers? Well, there is an easier way to learn and understand numbers. With Haans Enzensberger's childrens book The number Devil, its not only fun, but makes it all look easy. Sometimes it is, other times it can be overwhelming. The number devil is a story that takes place in dreamland where a child, who hates math and numbers finds out how numbers are essential to the world we live in. He also finds out that numbers are easy to understand, so long as we take the time to understaand them. Each chapter attempts to study a number. Starting with 0 and 1, then moving to others from 2 on up. Every number is a pattern and creates more patterns. Its a matter of seeing the patter that clears up the muddle of large numbers. I found this book easy to read and fun and educational. Highly reccomended!

Severin's release of The Beast in Space was remarkable in that they found the only complete print in a basement of a condemned porno theater outside Bologna. So here it is, the first time ever this is presented on DVD anywhere in the world. With that special presentation, what are you exactly in for?Without stating the obvious, the film is a mess. But thats where the fun begins. There is no real telling of what is happening, but one might surmise some of the possibilities. Ultimately this film is riding the coattails of two other films: The Beast (La Bete) and Star Wars. How you might imagine to combine these two films into one heap of psuedo-science-fiction with a touch of pornography? Its not easy, and watching this is not very easy either.The film is basically about Captain Larry (Vassili Karis) who, after beating up his enemy and having hot sex, discovers the mysterious energy force called Antalium, which is, evidently is a sexual energy. He sets up his team complete with Sirpa Lane (from the original La Bete) who all go to a planet to get more of this stuff. There they meet strange things, like horses having sex, cardboard aliens, phony light-sabers and a ugly bearded man who controls it all. After they partake in a dinner, an orgy starts to emerge and soon everyone is having a great time. The big hairy man we soon finds out is a Satyr and he is ready to put out, specifically to Sirpa.There are hardcore scenes in this version, but its really not erotic or sexually interesting. While the film is already cut-up to an incomprehensible mess, the hardcore footage does not help matters much either. Severin also released a standard unrated version sans the hard scenes if that is not your bag.The Beast in Space (Unrated Version)But this film is not meant to be high art. The best way to enjoy such a film is with your friends laughing at it over some drinks and whatever else that may help. Cause you will need help after you see this.My 3 stars is not a recommendation (in fact I really would not recommend it to anyone) nor is it on the quality of the film itself. But that its a lost film that has come to us again and it looks very good, all things considered. My rating is also simply that its a fun movie and should be taken as such. I love Severin's releases and look forward to them bringing out these dingy films from beneath the surface so new audiences can know about them as they only add to the culture and history of film.

This book is unique because its not just a book that gives a straight chronological view of the history of filmmaking. From Scholastic Voyages of Discovery series, in this book there are a set of stickers that you place throughout the book. Flip books, fold outs, transparencies, this book is a treat for anyone that enjoys films or for the beginner who is looking to learn the craft. Unfortunately this book is currently out of print, but its a fairly recent book so perhaps finding it will not be difficult. Not for the knowledgeable in film art who might be expecting new information. This book is designed for the beginner.

Cronenberg's early film from the 80's riding his wave from Scanners is an original film no doubt, and remains obscure for the most part. James Woods, in his usual fast-talking-coke-addict role that he plays so well, is a television producer for an underground station. Picking up some weird signals from something called 'Videodrome' where it closely resembles snuff. There is something Videodrome has that you dont have. Videodrome has a philosophy. From there Woods, who meets up with Blondie (Deborah Harry), spirals into a world where television and reality merge and mix where the lines of what we know to be real are not there anymore. If you catch yourself sliding into a hallucinatory trance, just sit back and enjoy it. This is one of Cronenbergs best films to date, also one of his most odd. Not for the squeamish, or those who like their realities disturbed. The DVD version is nothing to write home about; it features the obligatory trailer and character bios. Dont buy it for the extras!

I might have been too harsh in the subject heading seeing I gave it 3 stars, however, I feel that the film lacked the laughs that the trailer suggested. I really like Jason Bateman and he pulled off his role as well as one could possibly imagine, and quite honestly, so did the rest of the cast. In fact, the actors and actresses all did their job perfectly in this film, the problem lies in the script.The story is of a young man Joel (Bateman) who owns a factory that makes extract, be it vanilla, root beer or the new concoction: cookie dough. In comes the temp agent Cindy (Mila Kunis) who is interested in conning her way to meet with an employer who out seeking a 1 million dollar settlement from the extract company. Meanwhile, Joel is having marital problems with his wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig) who is not offering sex leaving Joel frustrated.Now these are the set up stories, all of which lead to very little or interesting situations. Joel's friend Dean (Ben Affleck) offers many suggestions, most of which are drug related and do little to provoke a reasonable solution or even funny moments. In fact, Joel comes off as naive by taking his suggestions in the first place. The worst situation Joel finds himself is when he hires a young guy to play a pool man to seduce his wife to test her fidelity, but even that went sour and gave no insight into the dilemma.The problem of the film seemed to lie in the fact that the characters were not developed enough, and the issues between the extract company and Joel's married life are two plots that co-exist, but never merge or cross paths. Cindy's conning scheme is only tangential to the extract company.I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did, but it just finished without anything really happening.

After at least a full year of immersing myself into Crowley's magick and occult studies, I continue to find myself coming back to this book. When I first got the book, I tried reading it and to make heads or tails of what I was reading, but to no avail, so I put the book down until a spark of light drew me closer to understanding. I remembered at one point reading in 'The Eye in the Triangle', a biography written by apprentice Israel Regardie, mentioning Crowley's fascination with mystery novels. I am not a big fan of mystery novels, but I decided to take one up (Robert B. Parker's Godwulf Manuscript for the curious), and it struck me at that point that it seemed to make sense that Crowley enjoyed these kinds of books as they are so evident in his own writing. This is the point of view in which I decided to understand Crowley - that is, to understand his work as a mystery waiting to be solved. You are the detective and you must put the pieces together. All the information is in front of you, but you must understand, interpret, infer, and join various bits of information to gain the whole picture. 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings is just that - a string of puzzle pieces that are shaken up in the box, and its up to you to put the work into it to make the connection. Crowley is not one for spoonfeeding information and this book certainly demonstrates this by having to understand numbers, symbolically and mathematically - how they relate to the Hebrew and Greek alephbet, tree of life, Chinese and Indian philosophy, and the universe: micro and macrocosm, and of course algebraic and trigonomic formulations. With this information that is put into a uniform system of systems. A good rule of thumb to keep in mind when studying (vs. reading), is that every sentence counts. Each line, number, column, diagonal, and row all have a correspondence to each other to make a relationship that, as the Gestalts would say, is &quot;greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; While this work is not for the beginner, and difficult for any novice, it is certainly a must for anyone who wants to dig a little deeper than love potions and money spells. If you can master the work in this book to the point where it is second nature, then Crowley's other works will illuminate itself freely to the trained mind. Crowley's writing is for those who want to &quot;do the work&quot; and not for the lazy person's guide to enlightenment. 777 stands as Crowley's testimony to his mastery over the subject as well as his versatility with understanding the nature of language and how it can be expressed; i.e. compressed information. I suggest to book cautiously to only those who are willing to take the task and set themselves on a journey into another world.

Presented from Holmes Publishing is a piece from famed occult priest Eliphas Levi. This small work is taken from his manuscript. No translator is indicated nor any other information about this work in general. The title reads, "The Kabbalistic Prayer Together With Occult and Religious Maxims from a Manuscript of Levi". The first part gives the prayer itself and then Levi goes on to explain the "hows" and "whats" of the ritual in his own mysterious, yet somehow, understandable language. From this are seeming random quotes or extracts from his writings that have some pertinence to the Work at hand. It ends with a page and half of his "Occult and Relgious Maxims", which are sort of one-liners for one to follow or adhere to while doing their work. At 20 pages one might find this book managable, however, that is only for those that have read Levi before or studies Kabbalah. The translation (assuming this was translated from the French) appears good and all words are spelled correctly. Levi's theories has been disputed before by his appraisers and followers, but one cannot dispute the importance of his writings.

A how-to book of Alchemy seems unheard of, but here it is! Written by Frater Albertus in the 60's, director of the (now closed down as of 1984) Paracelsus Research Society. The book acts as an introduction to the world of Alchemy, describing its process as well as the symbols employed in Alchemical nomenclature. While it may take a couple of readings to really and truly grasp it, the real learning takes place in the laboratory. Frater Albertus is clear in his meaning and attemts not to confuse the reading by falling to far into the mystical language of the alchemists. The only drawback that I personally had with this book is the M.S. of the &quot;Wisdom of the Sages&quot; installed after Albertus' own writings. The M.S. was written in 1777 written in Latin and German (here translated for you). The content is fine and dandy, however, if I wanted to read an alchemical text, I would not have bought this book to do so. There are plenty of ancient and medieval alchemical texts in print now where I can easily pick one up, however, this book's intention was to learn the art and practice of alchemy in its clearest unobtrusive language. Furthermore, the book is a little more than 100 pages, while the M.S. covers 40 of those pages - almost half the book. So this was disappointing when I wanted to read more of what Frater Albertus had to say. So if you are interested in Alchemy and want a glimmer of light into its practice, I highly reccomend this book, save the last portion of it.

A great presentation of the myth of Psyche and her trials, and integrating that knowledge with his own Jungian analysis. Tells the story well and simple, explaining what the trials in the story of Psyche are telling modern day women and men. The feminine aspects of the human have been trapped somewhere from Ancient Greece to about 1960, and is now slowly revealing itself. Johnson may have a good start and understanding of this knowledge for those who are looking for more of a balance in their lives.

...I bought the new "Masterpiece" edition as well as the newly digitized DVD version. Upon close inspection of the copies, I noticed not only a cover difference, but footage in the new one is altered. That is to say, the DVD and Masterpiece are shortened. Towards the end of the film, where Eric is about the be married to Ursala, there is the seemingly innocuous priest, who, while giving a sermon, is wagging his "phallus" up and down. Yes, you will see that in the Classics edition, but you will be cut short if you have the DVD or Masterpiece edition....As far as Little Mermaid is concerned, I hail it as one of their masterpieces because it is the last Disney cartoon to be fully hand-drawn as well as just a great movie unto itself. The three stars are towards the Masterpiece edition of the movie, and not the Classics edition. I may be making a fuss over a small issue, and it may even seem to others right for Disney to make the change, however, I just feel Disney should not be held responsible... If Disney wanted that little bit of humor in the film, then they should leave it in there.

Manly P. Hall, whose influence seems to have grown substantially since his death, wrote this little book in 1929 concerning the elementals. He begins with the four types of the Gnomes, Undines, Salamanders, and the Sylphs. Each pertaining to an element that it controls or dominates. Manly Hall goes on in disucssion about thought forms and emotions explaining, it is not important whether these are real entities in physical reality. In fact, it is better not to believe that. One reason, as explained, is that they are means of expressing a type of psychology of an age. &quot;Unseen Forces&quot; regards ghosts and spectres as a form of thought because there is no innate autonomy within the ghost, but rather move through &quot;wind&quot; of such forces. Hall concludes this book with a talk on the Guardians of the Threshold, being, the ego guarding the unconscious and gives an account of three steps towards wisdom. Much of what holds us back from attaining any type of wisdom is by holding onto the body, i.e. sins of the flesh. He states, &quot;Let us ask nothing of God until we have done our part.&quot;

The Imagineers, who have been put together by Walt Disney himself from his staff of animators, put their imagination and engineering expertise to work, making their movies in three-dimension. Anyone who visits Disney World, Florida will immediately note that not a detail gets by them where there is no cultural or graphic response to the scenery. All parts are integral, and the Imagineers recognize this. Some of the most wonderful aspects of their work is in the smallest detail, so as not to stand out, instead, it blends into the environment (like it should). The book is set up into parts of the varying departments of the Imagineers, in the stages in which they prepare a project. Like Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas' book 'The Illusion of Life' they do not fail to recognize good work from a particular artist. Even here, in the lesser known trait of architecture and engineering, the names are noted as any famous artist, which is refreshing and respectable for the artists in their own respective fields to be continually influenced by their peers. A wonderful book that is easy to read, does not burden the reader with too much technical jargon, and easy to appreciate the many pictures of their work. Certainly Disney enthusiasts will enjoy this book, as well as a prospective Imagineer.

Well, Christmas comes from Christ Mass, but thats another issue. However, Manly Hall puts together his historical knowledge of the ancients and explains that Christmas, although its meaning has not changed much, its practice has. Throughout the ages the day of December 25 has been celebrated by most religions, pagan or otherwise. Short and compact, this book will give you another light of the Christmas origin and its message.

Bourdieu's book, which is actually a lecture transcibed, is a look into the world of journalism on print and on television. Print, now being rivaled by the television news casthas to follow the steps in which television provides the material and the print media has to be there to create a uniformity in competition. If one veers, then people are unsure of what to read, and given the times and the message Bourdieu is giving, I would assume most would follow the TV news. The title of the book might be misleading in that its more about journalism than television itself. The author makes many profound obsevations as well as unveiling some of the competition that actually goes on in journalism where he asks the question &quot;Where does news come from?&quot; Answering quite plainly that the journalists do indeed choose what is news, and what isn't. A good read, a short book, however at some points dense and other points dry and repetitive. Overall highly reccomended for those interested in media theory.

A study in demonic possession is not a popular topic in too many circles, however, it still comes up from time to time in spiritual psychology. Upon doing my own research of what 'exactly' demonic possession is, 'The Exorcist' is certainly a must, no matter how exploited and distorted the matter has become. William Peter Blatty's book 'The Exorcist' stands as a compentent study of demonic possession in modern times told in story format. The crisis of Regan and her spiritual turmoil she will endeavor by the demon known as 'nowonami'. Yes, this is the backwards English she began to speak, however, in light of modern psychology, it is quite revealing about ones internal state as well as the perceptions one has of themself. The book is an easy read, and for the enthusiastic, you will go through it like a flip book. It would be difficult not to comment on the impression the film has made upon America minds, as one reads the book, one can picture so vividly the different scenes from the film. The film captures the book quite well and almost verbatim where the lines even become recognizable. Again, the only aspect of the book that was not captured in the film was the psychological end, which is too bad in some ways because now, for those who dont like to read, are left with a startling image with no 'intellectual reasoning' about what possession truly is (or might be). That is to say, they are left with feelings of 'I hope that does not happen to me', or 'I believe in God, so it wont happen to me', etc, etc. This is not to say the book is any less startling because of the intellectual content, but rather, because there is no definition of possession, the movie watcher is left with the belief that it is all based on supernatural powers of the devil and/or demons. The majority of the studies given within the framework of the story are legitimate and you can look them up in libraries and find them, which made this book so appealing to me. The story is told well, with well-defined and likable characters with some profound dialogue amongst the priests. My own understanding of demonic possession is not one displayed in this book where I felt it was probably over the top (I imagine for dramatic purposes). Nonetheless and great read and informative, I highly reccomend this novel as a great work of fiction in the last thirty years. If you have seen the movie and are willing to endure the cycle again, you will be thrilled you did. The movie, by and large, would be easier to sit through because the imagination is certainly more powerful than anything that can be projected onto a screen.

Author Paulo Coelho wrote this magnificent and simple story of a boy and his dreams. His night time dreams and his life time dreams. The boy has a dream that there lies a great treasure at the Pyramids in Egypt. After meeting with an elusive king, he sets on his journey to find not only his treasure, but to fulfill his Personal Legend. Wonderfully told, witty and inspiring. I felt I knew the character, the boy in his travels and understood his trials as well as the people he came in contact with. Coelho has written the classic story of the hero leaving his homeland to understand the world he lives in, on a spiritual adventure. This book was given to me as a gift from two close friends, and this book reminded me of the simplicity in life and appreciating each moment that comes to us, and treating each of those moments as an omen - to be fully aware that this moment in indeed a gift.

I was very excited to see the DVD of Schindler's List finally released. So excited, in fact, that I bought the Collector's Edition. To my dismay, it was not a very exciting collection.Before I get to that, I will just state that the movie is as good as ever and it has been some time since I have seen it. The quality is clean and clear, while sound is great. This is a film that utilizes the widescreen aspect and should be seen in this format (why they even offer a full screen is beyond my comprehension). Nonetheless, it is an amazing film; certainly Spielberg's finest to date.The collection that comes with the DVD does not quite meet the films quality. What you will receive in the set is a picture disc of the soundtrack. The soundtrack is from John Williams, and perhaps one of his most moving scores I have heard from him. While he instills his usual thematic sound, the music in this film has a deeply personal emotion that is carried with it, along with Itzhak Perlman's violin solos. Truly beautiful music, however sad it may sound.Along with the soundtrack is a senitype, which is a reproduction of one of the 35mm frames. I imagine they are the same pictures, one of the girl in the red coat walking along the streets. Its a nice photo, but why do I want it? What am I going to do with it?Also is a small hardcover book of images from the film. A nice book as well, but with a book that shows photos of the movie, why look at the book when you can just watch the movie? Very little in the making of the film.Finally is a Certificate of Authenticity. Now this just tops the cake. I mean, a Certificate that says this is a real AND official collector's set, because if I did not get one of these, I was going to assume this was a bootleg of some sort. There is not even a printed autograph! It just brags about the film and tells you what the set offers, which, if you did not open the set to see what was in it, you could not read this little certificate to see what was in it. Completely stupid.If that does not thrill you enough, then you will also get a little pamphlet that tells you about the SHOAH organization which you can send some money to support them. Ugh.The DVD offers some extras. No commentary, no behind the scenes footage. Can't break that fourth wall, now!! Keep it real! But you will get stories of the real Schindler Jews who have survived. You will also learn about the SHOAH organization. Furthermore is a video on Schindler's life, which is probably the best extra on the disc. The DVD is two-sided which is another unfortunate aspect which takes me back to the laser-disc days when I had to flip the disc over to continue the film. That annoyws me that I have to do that.The best part of the collection is the case, which is a plexiglass casing with the names of the list printed in gray. Its pretty cool. While all this stuff is held in a slip case, which does not hold it very well, the plexiglass case has some metal dowels to keep it all in place.In all, a poor set and for the price, definately not worth it. If I had known it was going to be a disappointing set, I would have just saved my money and bought the movie only version.The ratings are 5 stars for the movie, and 2 stars for the set, which culminates to about 3 stars overall. If you love the movie, get the movie, not this set.

I had a sense that Spielberg just made movies with big budgets and wrote him off as a big-budget director. After seeing this film I realized how good of a director Spielberg is. The finest attribute I can give above all others is his ability to tell stories in the clearest possible manner without any confusion. In Schindlers List, Spielberg demonstrates this so well intergrating the lives of Jewish Holocaust victims, Nazi soldiers, the time periods, the details of the buildings and signs. The most minute detail paid attention to. Neeson gives the performance of his career (I believed he should have gotten it instead of Hanks). The story of one Oskar Schindler, a Nazi, who saves 1000 Jews. Shot in a moody grainy black and white with John Williams and famous violinist Itzak Perlman composing a masterful moving score. This film is highly reccomended to anyone, although it is very graphic and intense at many times. Yet this violence does not in the least take away from the picture as a whole; only making the message louder. Certainly Spielberg has outdone himself in everyway and deserves to be in the ranks of some of the finest directors in history. This special edition of the film includes the Widescreen edition, as well as a limited print CD of the score. It also includes Thomas Keneely's novel of the same title, and a picture book with a few nice words by Spielberg. For the price, its not entirely worth it, unless you collect boxed sets or a huge Spielberg fan, otherwise the regular edition of the film will do.

David Lynch's best work to date is the story of a typical all-American USA town where all things seem perfect and normal. That is...until we see what a strange world it is. The boy finds a severed ear in a nearby dirt path on the way to the hospital and sets the story in motion. The cinematography has to be some of the best around, especially noticable in the opening scenes with the bright pastel colors of the town, the reds, the blues - so vivid - to give you the small town USA look. A detective mystery story told in Lynch's world where the weird only gets weirder. Dennis Hopper in one of his best roles as the wacked-out methyl junkie who holds a child hostage. If you like odd, this is your film. Not for the squeamish.

Leonardo Da Vinci's anatomical drawings, due to his extreme curiosity, became one of his most profound works to date. Published by Dover from the original text 1952. The book is set up in 2 columns and broken up into headers of different anatomical structures; either of bones, muscles, ventricles of the heart or brains. The chapters are broken into systems: nervous, cardiovascular, myological, osteological, respitory, alimentary and others. Within the text there are italicized words. These are the words written on the drawing itself, in Leonardo's usual backward writing style. Some of you might be curious, beyond the drawings themselves to read what Leonardo thought at the time. And from there is the authors commentary. For those interested in anatomy, drawing, painting or anything in the art field, this book is highly reccoemended, for it has limitless reference value. I continually look at it for my drawings. One will also notice that many of the &quot;models&quot; are of the same body or person. This is because Leonardo asked a friend on his deathbed if he could cut him up, dissect him and then draw him. The friend, of course, consented to this, and so we have Leonardo's masterpiece. Highly reccomended! Also reccomended is his Notebooks, also printed by Dover.

Although I bought this book for a different intention, I still found the book valuable, in that is went over some inventions from the past that is in everyday use where at the time of its inception, it was deemed ludicrous. Light bulbs, fax machines, teflon, nylon, silly putty, television, computers, video games and many more things that we today are so at home with. Easily written for the young adult with a style that is likeable.

Even 49 years after its initial publication, The Demolished Man still stands as a true science fiction novel. The story of Ben Reich living in a future world where mind reading is a commonality amongst a group known as 'Espers.' In a world without crime, for one can know when you will commit one, how is one to go about plotting a murder? Ben Reich has the perfect plan. This book captivated me from beginning to end when I read it 10 years ago and I continually reccomend it to those that enjoy science fiction. Author, Alfred Bester, won the first Hugo Award for Science Fiction for The Demolished Man. In my opinion this book is still the hallmark of science fiction novels, unfortunately, however, Bester himself is so unheard of in many literary circles and more so in the general public. I highly reccomnend this book for anyone who has a flare for science fiction.

Woody Allen's Best Picture Winner is one of the funniest films I have seen in some time. I cant say this is his best, for I have not seen them all (or nearly enough) to compare. However I do sense a certain sense of zenith achieved here with Allen's pictures. Woody Allen finds a charming insecure girl (Diane Keaton) whom they hit it off really well in the beginning, then begin to question their relationship. Played off really well with superb dialogue, shot in a somewhat discontinuous style. Truly and deservedly a classic by every standard. This DVD edition does not grant you with all the niceties of others, unless you are settled with just a trailer, cause thats all there is. Nonetheless, a great film for the whole family (excluding young children).

The one criticism that Zen practitioners offer in the world of Zen in the Western culture is that it has been intellectualized into absurdity. That is to say, in the Taoist tradition, by understanding Zen is not to understand it. Modern Zen in the West has taken on a psychological approach where one thinks in order to "get it", one must break it down in terms of how the mind responds while in practice. When one does not "get it" then it is written off as silly, irrational or impratical. From the writings of D. T. Suzuki, this irrationality is the root from which the practice begins. To put the student into a state of paradox because, "simply the human tongue is not an adequate organ for expressing the deepest truths". When there is no verbal expression, or thought connected with words in which to speak, then a paradox is set up. A crux that forfits the tongue and makes room for action. Suzuki who is known as the introducer of Zen as well as the foremost authority on the subject in the West writes clearly and accurately, which is impressive knowing that English is not his native language. Throughout the book Suzuki sites many examples of ancient literature of Zen Masters, monks and students who have experienced satori or enlightenment through the use of stories, anecdotes and parables. These "stories" are told as if they are historical, yet are designed to further the student into irrationality. In Western terms, it means to break the yes/no logic of the rational mind. While the book reads easily, Suzuki writes intellectually. Although it is intellectual, there is not a sense he is talking down to the reader or intellectualizing the subject. To epitomize the paradox, Suzuki is describing what is not Zen more so than what is Zen by the sheer fact that Zen is not a thing to grasp or see. By his descriptions, the only way it can be exposed most accurately is through the description of what is not Zen. The reader, after trying to pick sides of what Zen may in fact be will struggle with this. Is this Zen? Or is this not Zen? Upon giving up on the struggle, the last section of the book is reprinted in-part, Suzuki's book, 'The Training of the Zen Monk' and may come to some conclusion that Zen is not a thing or idea or philosophy, but a life to live by. Decribing the techniques and practices of various Zen disciplines, Suzuki emphasizes the strict lifestyle and loyalty to their work. I feel the word "work" best describes this lifestyle. I do not mean a job by any sense of the word, by work as in "doing with conscious intent". But because I dont practice Zen, I can intellectualize a little bit, which is why I practice yoga.

Mike Figgis' Academy Award winning film still stands after 5 years as a truly remarkable and realistic film on the true accounts of a washed up screenwriter. Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue both give the performance of their careers in some of the most demanding roles Hollywood has seen. Shue as a prostitute meets up with Cage, an alcoholic, whom both live together to share their deteriorating lives. A sad and overtly depressing film, however, not a moment goes by that you are not curious and hopeful for this desolate couple. Not for everyone, yet this film is highly reccomended to those who like something a little off-beat. The DVD transfer is really good, clean picture with nice sound. This is the 'unrated' version which means there is something of a questionable nature. However, if you compare VHS to DVD time length, you will see the DVD is one minute longer, and unless you know the film like the back of you hand, you wont notice any difference. Also there is a 'hidden feature' which when you do find it, you wont be happy to say its hidden, nor worth the while to make it so. Overall lame features, but the film is so good that one will buy it for the film and not its &quot;extras.&quot;

Beginning with a general survey of astrology, its general uses and ideas and then taking you through the various astrological systems. Historically and culturally the zodiacs are quite varied and the manner in which &quot;charts&quot; is unique also, starting with the Hindus and Burmese and moving along to Tibetan, Greek, Roman, Arab, and Aztec. This all sounds interesting, however, I found the text to be dry and focused more on accounts of the use of astrology rather than explaining the astrological system of each. In some instances, author and occult historian Manly P. Hall, does demonstrate some idea of how they are done, or how the zodiac equates with the calender and body, but it is far and few inbetween and left me yawning. Hall follows up from the different systems to a discourse on Astrology and Religion, Philosophy and Science. Drawing from his main influences, that of ancient philosophy and occultism, he attempts to bridge the gap to modern day understandings and presumes &quot;hopes for mankind that perfection of this art will raise social awareness and conditions far beyond our present limitations.&quot; Hall usually is a great read, but this one falls short compared to his other occult essays. Not reccomended for someone just into astrology, but rather for the student of astrology and astrology based predictions.

The Asylum group strikes once again capitalizing on trends and franchises of well known films. Here they tackle the Amityville House. Clearly when you watch it, our view of the house is kept vague enough to know they are just in any house as external shots are kept to a minimum.It opens citing the De Feo incident and then how the Lutzes moved in after. Thats about the only relationship this movie has to the previous Amityville franchise. Everything else is shot in "Paranormal Activity" style, ala camera point of view where the young boy seems to want to be the next "Spielberg" (actual quote). Meanwhile weird things are happening in the house that the boy either gets on video or not. The parents are ignorant, and his hot older sister is too interested in her own wants, while the younger sister seems to make imaginary friends.The acting is either over or under from the entire family. Clearly it is all scripted and, like all single point of view films, people are completely comfortable in letting out all their baggage and hostilities in front of the camera. And like all the others, people with cameras can multi-task.I might point out that the video on the phone turns from an iPod to an iPhone. Just an observation.The many "black outs" seem to be "creative" budget excuses. But they dont add to the drama or scariness of the film. In fact, the dad, who is the eternal realist, dulls the movie irreparably.It's a fun movie on it's own, which merits it one or two stars, but ultimately this is not part of the real Amityville franchise. The whole premise of ghostly stuff rests entirely on the Amityville house which, for the audience sake, does not need any real justification as its an already installed storyline. So now its just "happenings" that we can just assume its the house doing it. Now its a matter of how long it takes for the family to get scared and leave the house.EDIT: Ok, the final scenes are hilarious. Worth seeing for the dads acting alone.

Obscure in Crowley's classic style and not to be understood by just anyone, but rather of initiates, probationers, etc. He describes the purpose of the ritual as well as what to do setting it up and what to do during the ritual. Not for the restless or the restful, but indeed for all those that know - or, by Crowley's standards - think they know. Awaken thy sleep, not to the right, not to the left, but the middle and do what thou wilt.

This book, which is now out of print, published in 1986 by Harper and Row. Attributed to the authors of Hollis and Sibley, although on the book there is no credit other than in the acknowledgements. Regardless however, this is a fun book posing as Mickey's biography from his earliest times in Steamboat Willie and with Walt to the days of all his shorts and his feature film debut in Fantasia. The book also discusses Mickeys appearances in all the merchandising of the days, from watches to clocks to books to comic books, music, ornaments and then the last appearance; Mickey's Christmas Carol. Fun to read and enjoyable and sure to please any Mickey or Disney fan.

I particularly love Alan Watts' play on words in his titles, in which this case he does so well. A common phrase 'Does It Matter' is the subject in which the author explores and expresses his ideas of materialism in a materialistic age (more so now than in his own time - appearingly). Discussing his own perceptions in which the way things could be in order to get full advantage of living and being free from oneself as well as anything material. Yet, also expressing the notion that materialism, in all its greed and desires, can be viewed as spiritual and indeed be part of every persons awakening to real life.

I picked this book at a used book store on a whim because of its quirky title and even more amusing was the authors name who was attached to it. Something was not right, so I was curious to check it out. I began reading (like all my books) and soon discovered the hilarity and wit that Dr. Issac Asimov can convey. From what I understand from talking to some films is that Dr. A was indeed a Drity Old Man. The book is a guide book for the young and old alike, the male and female (but mostly male). It acts as a handbook for the pickup artist. To ogle at women with a smile. To take your hand off her knee if she asks, and to put it on her thigh. Clever and indeed insightful, even if its all tongue-in-cheek. Dr. A., and his photographic memory of quoting some wacky moments of history past is just perfect for the confidence level that one places when seeing a hot broad strutting down the street. Afterall, if she is showing cleavage, should not men look at it? What else should we do? As it states: &quot;Don't peep at girls - STARE!&quot; Other anecdotes to those who are inferier to approaching good looking women are those with morals. &quot;Many regard the matter of mammary display as a frontal attack on our standards morality. Sometimes, I tend to agree with them. Many is the occasion on which I have looked down on low-cut dresses.&quot; Dr. A's historical satire is wonderful, as mentioned earlier, is not just a remark on the confidence level one should have, that a man who peeps, leers, looks or smiles in the direction of a female, but also a gesture to the woman that your confidence equals that of the female who is looked upon. Dr. A. says &quot;[Joe] Green, having emigrated to Italy, adopted the Italian version of his name, Giuseppe Verdi. For reasons known only to opera buffs, the Italian name is actually better known today than the name he was born with in Pughkeepsie, New York.&quot; Verdi was a Dirty Old Man. And Vice-President Charles Curtis was a Dirty Old Man. Oliver Wendell Holmes was not. Asimov fans may not appreciate this book as much as his science-fiction or works of non-fiction, however, those who are looking for a genuine laugh, and those who love literature would surely find this little book a gem. Unfortunately, now it is out of print, and unless you want to pay heavily for first prints, a paperback would suit the purpose.

In this short work by Manly Hall, he digresses into the little known subject of how the ancient masters of the mystery schools go about teaching their students. Much has changed in the way of secret societies since the days of Plato and Pythagoras, however, the principles are generally the same. Silence is still of utmost importance. In the times of Pythagoras, silence was not only a virtue, but something your life depended upon. Today, you will not get crucified or burned at the stake for revealing secrets from a society, however, your integrity and Will are disseminated. Silence today stands as a virtue more than anything, but one that most people neglect. This short book also looks into the practices of the Student, Disciple and Initiate, as the basic three grades of the practitioner once they have entered a mystery school. Even today all of these attitudes that Hall speaks about have complete practicality in today's culture. It is less about environment and more about the demeanor of the practitioner. If one does not take in all of the ideas represented in this book, surely one or two of them will cling to the readers mind as not only possible, but inspirational. For those that have been practicing the secret arts for a period of time, this book may serve as a good reminder of why they are doing what they do to begin with.

This is Dore's Bible Illustrations with the complete text of the Holy Bible. I cant comment neccessarily on the printing by First Glance Books, for some of them I feel are somewhat light. However, this does not take away from the beauty of the illustrations that Dore did in the 1800's. This book is a republication of an earlier edition from the 1860's by Alfred Mame &amp; Fils, which was a religious publisher. This book is not designed for the art lover, but rather for the child or person who wants to read the Bible at home. Although the cover states &quot;With Engravings By Gustav Dore,&quot; this book is not a tribute to his work, so much as its only an addition to the Bible itself, for there is only a blurp of his biography underneath the publishers information. However, the book is hardbound with a red cover and gold metallic pages, and a gold embossed lettering on the cover. Certainly if you are a fan of Dore's work I highly reccomend this edition (which currently and unfortunately is back ordered - check out Crown Book stores), for I prefer the full text edition rather than just the illustrations themselves, as I feel the text gives so much more life and importance to the engravings.

Most of us mimick frogs by saying &quot;ribbit&quot; and when we say that we usually mean &quot;frog&quot; in the most general sense. We are pretty sure, however, that frogs really dont say &quot;ribbit.&quot; As humans we hear the sound and desparately try to make meaning out of it in order to understand it. A frog sound is then generalized into &quot;ribbit,&quot; which now stands as the meaning, while the frog itself is the symbol. We have learned this process some time ago as children. All frogs then say the same thing. In our minds we only hear one sound a frog can make. It may even be questionable that when a frog utters a sound, we can wonder if we heard the noise or our own minds uttering the sound &quot;ribbit.&quot; The reverse of this is true, that all objects that utter the sound &quot;ribbit&quot; must be a frog and therefore there is no difference made among any frog. We have been so successful at talking with other humans about the sound &quot;ribbit&quot; that we carry it over into any other animal types that makes strange sounds and generalized them into words. The squawk of a crow, the trumpeting of an elephant, or the laugh of a hyena are other such cases in which sounds have been generalized (and to some degree nominalized) into meaning/symbol relationships.The usefulness of this pattern of learning is as a stepping stone to create meaning/symbol structures in our brains for recognizing various life forms. When it is relied upon as a reality map, it fails completely because there is no differentiation involved in more complex life forms, like humans. In the realm of human interaction, it would be a mistake to speak to all humans using the same meaning/symbol structure. If every human that greets you says &quot;hello&quot; and you take that meaning and apply to the symbol of the human, your responses to the world are going to be very limited.Your ears, eyes and tactile sensations must be senstitive to varying patterns of human life when observing. I know from experience every human does not sound out &quot;hello&quot; to me upon a greeting. I also know that every time the sound &quot;hello&quot; is spoken, it is not directed towards me to respond to. I have to pay attention to where the sound is coming from as well as the particular human that expresses themselves in this form.The English language may be a more complex form of &quot;ribbeting&quot; which makes it easier for us humans to distinguish one sound pattern from another. With our vocal cords we can create a far greater range of sounds than a frog can. Because of the varied sounds, we can equally match the number of responses to that sound. Furthermore, we can respond in number of sounds to any one particular sound. A &quot;hello&quot; does not need to be responded to with another &quot;hello.&quot; Parrots have a limited vocal and neurological response repertoire, which is why they mimick the sounds they do. Humans on the other hand are able to respond fully to the situation utilizing a much larger range of responses that can alter, vary or change the behavior of the human they interact with.The one variable that allows humans to make that change is through choice, which is essentially a metaprogram of two or more consciously availalbe programs to run within the system. It is decision making at its most elite because within the program is a place that allows learning to occur from the reaction to the response. By having acute sensitivity to your senses, you can learn about reactions to your responses from varying humans, and, furthermore, you also learn about your own behaviors.The frog does not say &quot;ribbit.&quot; Does it say anything that has content value? Probably not. The frog does not impart intellectual information. For it, it is totally useless to the frog. No, the frog sends a message, both to itself and to fellow frogs. The message is not transcribable, but rather process oriented, to order, direct and illuminate to the other frogs of its secrets that it has discovered. The frog does this to interact and become intimate with its environment and become more and more involved in its own life as well as the life of others. When a frog has illuminated other frogs of its discoveries, the other frogs chant along the same song of the mysteries. Yet, the frog that made the discovery does not see itself as a frog, or think of itself in those terms. It has grown up. When the other frogs hop along and gather around to sing along, they surround it in reverence that, this is not a frog anymore, but a prince.

Personal as this may be, R. A. Wilson's account of the spiritual, supernatural, occult, magic, whatever term you want to give it, is an exciting journey through time and space as we venture through wormholes, blackholes and kaleidascopes as well. 23's and Sirius is the focus, while contact with aliens and revelations of Horus with a touch of ESP are all inclusive in a synchronistic style. Classic Wilsonian literature!

This is my all time favorite Disney film. The animation is bar none the best the Disney team has ever produced. The gentleness of the animals in the landscapes of the forest, so tenderly drawn as if they were delicate ceramic pieces. The story alone one can see the sheer beauty and patience Disney has put into this film, where the characters seem fragile, but yet have a life of thier own, growing up in the woods where anything can happen. Aside from some speculated &quot;violent&quot; scenes near the end, I would highly reccomend this to anyone, family and friend alike.

Have you wanted to know your future? Did you wonder if today will be a good day or a bad day? Ever wonder what problems you have had in the past and how to resolve them? Then you may have come across the book you are looking for. Famous Occultist S. L. MacGregor Mathers gives a short discourse on the Tarot which is a reprint of a short pamphlet printed in 1888. Personally I have always been apprehensive when it comes to divination of any sort, however, I liked Mathers approach. Although its a short treatise with a brief runabout of the history and meanings, it is implicitly implied how to set up the reading and how to read it. Stating also that oneself be the sole reader as one should own their own cards and do their own readings. Reason being, if my intuition serves me based on his other works, is the energy that surrounds the deck you hold is not tainted with other less informed beings so the message will not be dulluted with too much mixed eneregy. Unless you have your own set of meanings, then the interpretations in this book will be adequate for any beginner. Well designed book that is easy to read an informative. If you enjoy Mathers and are a fan of the Tarot, this is a good introduction.

Adrian Lyne, who directed this newer version of Vladimir Nabokov's classic love story 'Lolita' gives every effort to be true to the book. Unfortunately, being faithful to the book is its major downfall as no one in the story has any chemistry with each other and the movie fails to bring out the humor of the book.If you only saw this version of the movie and not read the book, you might think this a good film. If you read the book, chances are, you have seen the Kubrick and this version and will inevitably make comparisons of the three. The book stands on its own and one could not realistically be made into a film using the book as the only reference. Nabokov wrote the script for Kubrick, but was eventually heavily edited by Kubrick (although still given screenplay credit). The book has too many subtleties and linguistic atmosphere that gets lost in cinema and so is compensated elsewhere.Adrian Lynne chose Melanie Griffith as Delores Haze, Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and Dorothy Swain as Lolita. All of them have their own merit, but together in this film they do not seem to get along to create substantial chemistry that gives the audience any feeling for them. Griffith has a flat affect in every line of dialogue and her scene where she discovers Humbert's secret is soft and expressionless. She comes off as dismissive more than angry or outraged. She seemed far too much in control. Jeremy Irons always seemed aloof and dumbstruck, especially in the scenes with Lolita. But this reaction never came across as the character Humbert in any way as intellectual. Humbert is not passionate nor a stuffy intellect, nor does any of his foolishness come through in the performance. Lastly, Swain as Lolita was just plain annoying. Yes, the book version of Lolita had her childish whims and charms, but there was an appealing quality that is not shown here.All of the characters all seem to be going through the motions of whats on the script, but no one ever really understanding the characters and missing the comedy as well. Which, as mentioned, this is a more faithful version of the book, but it seems to me that Lynn only saw it as a serious drama and not as a comedy of characters. Which is why, although Kubrick's version is not as faithful, keeps Nabokov's style of writing in tact within the film. Mason, Lyons and Winters as well as Sellers are perfect in their roles and know their characters from the 1962 version. There is much more psychology and irony in Kubrick than in this version.Adrian Lynne, whose past works include 9 1/2 Weeks, Indecent Proposal, Unfaithful and Fatal Attraction are all sex themed stories, which makes me wonder if there was a type of exploitive quality that reduced this story to be about sex and not about Humbert Humbert's (albeit twisted) understanding of love.

Time-Life's series &quot;Mysteries of the Unknown&quot; is a fascinating and well accounted collection of strange phenomena and speculations. 'Time and Space' covers ancients concepts of time and space all the way to modern quantum physics of Stephen Hawking. To many of us, Einstein, Hawking, Heisenberg and Penrose's theories are far from anything abnormal, however, when one steps into a place and seemingly transported to another time, this science has yet to acknowledge as either true, or verifiable. Does time has a place, and does space have a time. In some cases it would seem that a particular time is intricately linked with a particular space - and that each, when linked, creates a particular memory that we can view. This is a great series, and gives good objective information from many well known sources.

Master filmmaker and artist, Orson Welles, takes you on an intriguing trip into the world of the Fake and the Real. Do you really know the difference between what people tell you and what you know to be real? Perhaps enough people have told you the &quot;truth&quot; where it seems there is no doubt as to what is really real, when all along you were given an pseudo-truth when in fact the truth turned out to be comepletely fake and no one knew about it. This idea, essentially is what this film is about. Filmed in a documentary style, mainly focusing on the life of Elmyr de Hory, one of his many &quot;fake&quot; names. Elmyr is a famous artist, except no one knows who he is because he has &quot;faked&quot; other famous artist masterpieces. In which case the &quot;experts&quot; cannot tell one from the other. So much, in fact, that the &quot;experts&quot; have argued emphatically that Elmyr's version is the &quot;real&quot; one. The well known biographer Clifford Irving wrote about Elmyr's life and his &quot;fake&quot; masterpieces. Irving known especially for the biography of the late Howard Hughes. Except one &quot;fact remained in suspicion of Irving's book is how this man comes along and is granted an interview with Mr. Hughes who has been in hiding for the past 20 years. So the argument remained that Irving's biography of Hughes was indeed &quot;faked.&quot; Mr. Orson Welles, who appears from time to time is credited as the director did indeed direct some of the film, while he &quot;faked&quot; it other times. Welles known for his &quot;fake&quot; news bulletin of the War of the Worlds also lets the view see one hour of totally &quot;true&quot; documentary of Elmyr, Hughes and Irving. This is nice of Mr. Welles, and if anyone knows about time, they will bear in mind the film runs longer than one hour.Its not a casual film of entertainment like Welles' other works, some deemed the best in film history by some &quot;experts.&quot; No, this film takes some turns of the usual Hollywood style narrative and makes an almost chaotic feast of editing where time seems to have slowed down. The only draw back to the film is the one just mentioned, that it seems entirely too long when in fact its quite shorter than one expects. Another leg Mr. Welles pulls on the viewers to have them presume as much as they want and get something entirely different.Not for everyone's taste, but certainly for either the Orson Welles fanatic, and for the person who likes to have thier reality challenged. Cutting edge by means of style and presentation of the film, Mr. Welles has certainly done it again. Unfortunately this has dropped into the back shelf of &quot;important&quot; films.

I read this some time ago when it first came and anticipated the film (which was highly disappointing). Crichtons mystery novel in the world of business and computers and sexual harassment. Tom Sanders who works for a computer company, when an old friend, female friend, comes into play as his boss. She lays down the laws that eventually work against him in this great thriller that I found a vary hard book to put down. Well written, easy and informative as well, which makes Crichton so intriguing is his factual knowledge he places within the context of the fictional world. Reccomended for mystery lovers, and those on the trail of reading Crichton.

Remiscent of Andreas Versalius, however not as complete at only 62 pages. Pietro is obviously a lesser known Italian artist from the 1600's, however his work is marvelous in itself. Showing the anatomy dissected in pose the muscles, organs and nervous system of the human body. No text accompanies these drawings besides and introductin and plate names. For the price it is well worth it for the student of anatomy and art, however if you have yet to get Leonardo's work on the human body or Andreas Versalius, then get those first.

Watts' classic book from the sixties is, what I would call, a beginners guide to realism. Not in a frame of artwork, but in seeing reality more interestingly and indiscriminately. The author teaches, in his classic almost inadvertent style, to turn the world upside down and see it as being right side up. The structuring of our eye loosen up when we change the grids of longitude and latitude of mapping our world into a freeform chaotic wonder. The simpleness of every moment.

If you want to know how much Laetita enjoys modeling, or she feels about her body, or her thoughts on dating, well then you will enjoy this book. While this book tries to present Laetitia as a three-dimensional character by quoting her and her friends, the quotes and write-ups only detract from what the book intends. Its a picture book of Laetitia Casta in all her form and beauty, in mostly every pose you can think of. Some photos are friendly, others seductive, and certainly some where you cant move your eyes from the picture. I am not concerned with how nice a person she may be, or what her agents say about her, I dont even care what she looks for in a boyfriend because thats not why I bought the book. If I wanted that, I surely could pick up any Cosmopolitan and find out anything about her. Or go on the internet. No, I just wanted to look. I wanted to use my eyes and gaze upon her shapely legs, her gorgeous breasts, and her angelic face. Thats what I bought this book for and thats what I did (ok, I did read the by-lines and sound bites, but for what end I am not sure). A good book for anyone who loves to look at a beautiful woman. Better because its Laetitia.

Its understandable how this book can upset people. Either Christians, pagans, occultists or whomever. However, regardless of the word Satan, I found this to be a good base to start out for anyone looking to understand ourselves in a new way. You could probably go over the book and replace the word Satan with God, or even with Your Own Name and the results will be similar (if not more profound). From what I can tell, LaVey is not presuming Satan to be a mythical figure from the Bible. Although he trashes Christianity, I believe he does this because Christians have a human conception of God, so therefore Satan must be human, which LaVey is showing you how to change your perception of what Satan means. The book, to me, is about questioning authority. To not let otehrs decide your fate or likes or dislikes, but for your self to determine what makes you happy. Furthermore, to question yourself as an authority. Who controls your thoughts, what controls your thoughts and how did they get there? Control them! The book has a masterialistic ring to it all, but I think the essence is in questioning what authorities are controlling your life and to be released from it. I think its irrelevant that he may have 'stole' rituals from older Orders (as other reviewers yelled about). Crowley has done that, Regardie and so many others have used rituals from the past and revised them to their liking. Picasso said &quot;Good artists copy, great ones steal.&quot; Its up to you to determine the level of ingenuity LaVey has. The Satanic Bible offers some good advice, but can misconstrued as evil (easily so) if not taken lightly and religiously. I enjoyed the book and the message LaVey sends, for I dont see it as Satanic in the childish perspective, but as a means to get the neurons firing and the blood pumping and to stretch those muscles at the corners of your mouth upwards.

I can see why all the hype when this book came out, but a better look at this book will reveal that there is nothing metaphysical besides some visual and auditory hallucinations similar to what you would find in a psychiatric hospital. Easy to read and intriguining no doubt, yet it falls short in reality.

This perhaps is the most amazing DVD set that I have ever seen! I dont think anything the major studios put out will compare in quality or content. Being a fan of the series, it is an awesome set to own every episode among the special features, as well as the signed card. This is the Limited Edition version, only 2500 were made.If you are looking here, you already know the story that went down with it and how it sold out quickly, which is why MPI went ahead and made a non-numbered version. Not sure if that will be limited, but I am hedging my guess it wont be around forever.With the story of Victoria Winters who comes upon more family problems than anything that I could even compare, we get a delicious gothic unfolding of myths, occult, vampires, wolves and other spiritual phantoms of the night that will creep us out. Not to mention the strange secrets the family seems to have hidden away in their dusty home of Collinwood. With excellent story telling, deliberate pacing, and usually campy, but adoringly so, their acting comes across true in nature.Dark Shadows is a one of a kind that wont be replicated by our current trends of culture and television and cinema (a hint at the upcoming film by Burton and Depp that is sure to strike fire in their eyes by the most ardent fans).With that said, if you bought the set and are unpleased. Amazon is currently offering (as of this writing) to buy the set back at a grand amount of $2.50!! They are so generous. I'd be willing to double that if you are interested :)

Perhaps one of the most elusive books on the occult market is Eliphas Levi's "Transcendental Magic: It's Doctrine and Ritual". Originally written in French with the title "Dogme et Ritual de la Haute Magie" (1855-1856, published in two volumes), translated literally as "The Dogma and Ritual of High Magic", revised to the current title by translator and commentator, the questionable Arthur Edward Waite."Transcendental Magic" is broken into two books, appropriately "Doctrine" and "Ritual". Both books are divided up into 22 chapters. While it seems evident to any occult student that they equate to the tarot deck and Hebrew letter/number system, A. E. Waite immediately rejects this as only coincidence by stating "that which emerges, however, is its utter confusion." Waite apparently had difficulty relating the first chapter, "The Candidate" to the Juggler (Waite was part of the Golden Dawn which alters various symbols from the O.T.O, A.'.A.'., and other occult schools). Furthermore, the second book begins with "Preparations", which Waite believes makes no correspondence to "The Candidate" or The Juggler. Waite who translated the book to a very readable and exciting version is too hung up on historical accuracy, which accounts for most of his confusion. Waite is trying to fit square pegs into round holes.Eliphas Levi, a priest of the Catholic Church, although wrote about occultism, still maintained faith in the Church. As one reads his other works, such as "The Great Secret" or "The Mysteries of the Qabalah", you will see his faith in Christianity is still evident from his exposition on the Christian and Jewish myths. "Transcendental Magic", however, still stands as his most impressive and complete work, which, as well has touches of Christianity within its pages. Any honest occultist will recognize the value of Christian and Jewish mythology as the foundation of modern occult practice. As expounded by Levi a number of times, any good Church-going Christian will know what "The Seven Seals of St. John" is referring.It may be evident immediately that a once read will not suffice in capturing the meaning of Levi's words. I found immensely valuable a dictionary of etymology and a Greek, Hebrew and Latin dictionary (Oxford I prefer for all). Levi employs many strange words that one will need to know on a continual basis to grasp entirely. These words are paradoxical in practical work: they serve to further understanding by decoding various names and they serve as symbols unto themselves that one uses to activate various states. The beginning of each of the chapters in the book of the Doctrine lists the title, a Roman numeral, a Hebrew character, and a few words in other languages outside of English. It is prudent for the student to study those words in relation to all that precedes and follows it. They don't make sentences, but they will make sense.While at first I read it from front to back, but as I was studying it, I found it more effective to read the first chapter from the Doctrine and then the first chapter from the Ritual. Essentially what you are reading is the "philosophical attitude" one must take, and then a means in which to maintain or carry that attitude through. The most confusing aspect for modern occultists is the Tarot attributions. There are many people who buy this in hopes for a book on Tarot, but they will certainly be disappointed. In most decks, it is common to give The Fool the numerical attribution of "0", the world egg, the inner and outer, evolution and involution. What Levi does is attribute 21 to the Fool, "Dentes Furca Amens" - the serpent tongue, the forked tooth (ala Shin), or liar in our modern nomenclature. Levi, however, is not alluding only to lying, but also "slips of the tongue" as in a Freudian nature and also speaking without restraint of thought. This chapter is headed with "Divination", where a diviner does not listen to their thoughts or prejudge a situation. They let the words roll off the tongue. This perhaps confuses anyone studying Crowley or Waite's deck or any popular run-of-the-mill tarot (save the Hall/Knapp and Taviglione decks).To think of this book purely as a guide to the Tarot is to misunderstand the work entirely. As Levi says in the first chapter, "The man who loves his own opinions and fears to part with them, who suspects new truths, who is unprepared to doubt everything rather than admit anything on chance, should close this book: for him it is useless and dangerous."To the student who is persistent in challenge, willing to discredit his own knowledge will find this book to his advantage. It may also be useful to check up on some of Aleister Crowley's works as he was highly influenced by Levi, and his perspective may lighten things up. Specifically Magic Book 4 and Book of Thoth which discuss some of Levi's works.

Bandler and Grinder's lecture style book is easy to read with many experiemtns to try out. Learning the ways of NLP you can do anchoring, light or deep trance inductions, reframing, and other phenomenal occurences. Also is the discussion of natural states of trance as well as phony mind readers. Putting the reader in a light trance during the intercourse of the book, internally the reader becomes unconsciously aware of how to hypnotize anyone, and when practice, all unconscious information becomes conscious. So then you know it all! Excellent book, well written with humor, wit and practicality for just about anyone doing anything. Bandler and Grinder have mastered their art to an easily accessible practice. Highly reccomended. If you have not already bought 'Frogs Into Princess,' Structure of Magic 1&amp;2,' Patterns 1&amp;2,' and 'Reframing,' you may be advised in the course of reading to read it.

Psycholigst and philosopher Sam Keen explores the inner depths and growth of the human consciousness and observes how we grow to love, grow to hate, or grow to become passionate about life. The book is set up where each chapter is a stage in a persons life. Where they get stuck or caught, how to grow, and the problems that arise out of each stage. Keen not only lets you explore your life, but gives his own as a testiment the problems anyone can have. From death, to seperation to rebirth. Told from a mythological point of view thanks to his good friend Joseph Campbell, Keen defines myth as &quot;the system of basic metaphors, images, and stories that in-forms the perceptions, memories, and aspirations of a people; provides the rationale for its institutions, rituals, and power structures; and gives a map of the purpose and stages of life.&quot; This defintion is the epitomy of the entire book which also follows its own rules. What I found most influential about this book is it allowed me to examine my own life, the loves I have gaines and lost, where I have gone on my own personal journey, and who I took with me, and who I want to take with me. There are many moments which I was dumbfounded by a stroke of inspiration and enlightenment. Other times I was upset and depressed by the hard truths and realities of our world. But by the end of the book, whether I was happy or mad, I knew that my thinking had changed and allowed me to be more sensitive to others as well as myself. As a human being, there is the obligation that we must pay to enter into society and be with other fellow human beings. To co-operate with eachother, to inspire, guide, help, and trust others, companion or stranger. The passionate life is not one full of lust and sex - no, that is far from the truth. It is one who lives every moment full of breath. One who sees the mundane as divine. To experience the sensorium of our bodies. Sam Keen has done a remarkable job hitting the nail on the head seemingly every time. This book, written back in 1982 and revised in 1993 seems more relevant today than it did at the time he wrote it.

R. A. Wilson's early book on secret orders of the old and drugs of today. Mystics and psychedelics, cops and addicts. Promiscuity and frigidity. All of these are taken into account, which is definately a scholarly look into the world of drugs and whether or not they are dangerous as well as the uses for them and their user intentions. Each chapter looks in depth into a different drug, there are 5 main drugs: LSD, Cocaine, Alcohol, Marijuana, and Heroin. After each chapter there is a story that gives a personal account of someone RAW met whom had troubles with dugs, either of addiction or some other problem that drugs helped or caused damage. Overall its an objective look into drugs, although Wilson gives some hints that he is pro-drugs (by the fact that he himslef clearly states his use of drugs). However, like Leary and Crowley, the use of drugs should be used moderately, intelligently and with a guide. The reason this book did not get 5 stars is because A) there are so many mispellings in this book that New Falcon should look it over again, or whoever edits this book should be replaced. B) R. A. Wilson, although it is quite clear in how intelligent he is, and his comprehension level is amazing, yet he takes a complex subject like the works of Aleister Crowley and explains the message behind the veil (perhaps it can be argued of what Crowley is really saying, but this is what I gatehred in the reading). Robert A. Wilson shows Crowleys work in a new light, certainly, but it was too explanatory and made Crowleys work too obvious to enjoy the mystery behind the works of the great Magician. Nonetheless, however, I feel its a good companion to the rest of Wilson's work, and by right it fits in niceley. Wilson has done a great job researching his material showing both the cons and pros of drugs which would make one not only more aware of the drug they choose (if they choose, as well as drugs in themselves), but also being aware of the circumstances surrounding them as well as consequences. Reccomended with this book is Timothy Leary's book &quot;The Delicious Grace of Moving One's Hand.&quot;

What starts out as a typical slasher where 5 teens head into the woods for a weekend getaway, turns VERY quickly into a nightmare. So quick does this nightmare ensue, that the music doesn't even have time to change tempo and for the most part is either inappropriate or ironic at best.Before you figure out what is going on, we are already down to one victim left who is soon chased. She is our heroine of the story. We don't know this at the get-go because not one moment has been spent on getting to know anyone.The ending is a bizarre twist of things which I wont reveal here, but certainly makes you shake your head and wonder what has really happened.I did not like the film. Although I give it props for maybe changing up the patterns a little, in the end, I dont think it works. There is no set up, no character development, no location to identify, and no motivation or morality to adhere. There is nothing from a narrative point of view that adds up to anything worthwhile.Technically speaking, I think it is well produced with good direction and camera work. The acting leaves some to be desired, but given its generally a low budget film, it is permissible on some level.But all the technical merits I might garnish it does not save it, but if anything, makes it a little more watchable.With that said, I did see the whole thing because of its uncharacteristic structure, I was curious to see where it would go. It seems the surprises that happened initially did not do anything for the plot, just seemed to make things happen faster. Critically, this film needs to be reworked, even if in a cliche slasher film format, it might be creepier. As it stands, it has no emotion and no intensity behind it leaving it flat and uninteresting.

This work by Blackstone and Josipovic is an adequate introduction to Zen Buddhism with some nice history. When it gets into practice and study is where I stumbled. In the discussion of the koan, the authors read off a few that I am familiar with, but then this one, which I found strange they would include it:&quot;One day he [Choa-chou] fell down in the snow and cried out &quot;Help me up, help me up!&quot; A monk ran over and lay down beside him. Choa-chou got up and walked away. (If you can guess who learned what in the above situation, you are doing better than the authors). pg 100I felt the authors should have left that out, for it made me suspicious of the rest of the book. A fun book otherwise and good for someone who knows a little more about Zen than just a beginner, for they will have a more refined view.

If you never have read Nietzsche, but are curious, then this is the book for you! Its not a Cliff's Notes, but its a concise comic story of the life and philosophy of Nietzsche. Written by Marc Sautet, this book will give the beginner a tactile version of his work, as well as something which one can have somne adequate and fundamental knowledge of who Nietzsche was. Reccomended for the beginner absolutely!

Existential playwrite Samuel Beckett writes of the absurd in this tragic comedy of two old friends who are waiting for someone named Godot. Of course they dont know who he is, nor do they know anything about him (or It), but nonetheless, they are waiting for him. Witty and charming throughout, as well as non-sensical and of course absurd. Definately a classic! This play also raises many theological and philisiophical questions as to what Godot is, many speculate it is indeed God(ot?). It would seem to fit. Highly reccomended for anyone interested in writing, plays and literature as well as existentialists.

Dr. Paul Watzlawick's book of change and communication, largely based on the work of Milton H. Erickson, dives right into the theories of the left and right hemispheric patterns in humans. Then discusses the language patterns of schizophrenics. These two major themes when studied and practiced yields a result of change. Watzlawick understands both that: all people have a set of language patterns; and secondly all people are using their brain when they speak. Knowing this will able the reader to speak effectively to a schizophrenic, or just about anyone in a theraputic sense which will allow change in individuals. This book is easy to read with a lot of information with a wonderful conclusion. Highly reccomended for those working in clinical psychology or just looking to change your self.

Schlosser's book 'Fast Food Nation' is about the effects of specialization in the industrial age. More specifically, its the product of transition of industrial turned information. Like the information age, it is primarily concerned with speed (which creates homogenization), while industry is concerned with quantity - yet they are intergral aspects of the Fast Food way. What Schlosser points is the devlopment out of the times in which it was born, that of the superhighways, automobiles and migration to the West. The assembly line coupled with high speed information output gives you the original McDonald's "Speedee Service System". From this its all down hill. While many of us suspect that McDonald's does not serve high-grade meat to its customers, and other fast food chains are bent upon profit over quality, the book stresses working conditions of both the fast food chains as well as the meatpacking and potato industry. Neither are fun atmospheres, and both apparently have their dangers. It is this revelation to the reader that the author stresses, and to make you aware of what you are eating. Perhaps in a consolidated form, it seems as if eating hamburgers will give you a 1 in 10 chance of digesting a foodborne pathogen. This is the decision the reader must ask: is all the meat bad? Do I want to support McDonalds and other fast food chains and the way they treat people? It is self-evident that companies want to make money. To what end you may ask. From reading this book, I suspect that any large corporation takes little value in their work crew, and process the work with little cost as possible for maximum profits. That is the nature of corporate life.The book is an enjoyable read that goes down easily. Some of the testimonial statements read too much like an A&E; biography, expecting the news cast or narrator to shed a tear at any moment. This, to me, takes away some of the objective work that went into the rest of the book. It is clear to the reader that there are some jabs at the fast food market, specifically McDonalds as they are consistently the largest corporation and appear to be the most corrupt from a humanistic point of view; willing to step on anyone who might take away a consumer.It seems that Schlosser may have hit the right button, as controversy surrounding the book builds, that the fast food industry are not making any rebuttals or attempting to remove the book from the shelves. I am sure that Harper-Perennial also made sure that this book is not just anger vented at a particular group made to sound like fact. Whatever you decide, the book is worth the read and cause for good conversation about how to choose your eating style. Because, in the end, from a reader perspective, its not about whether capitalism is great or terrible, or whether McDonalds will rule the world or fall, or if people who choose to work in slaughter houses hate their jobs continue to work there. All of these are in someways inevitable. If its not McDonalds, then some health food idea will come about, and demand will be too great that corners will have to be cut; provided they are out to meet the demands of the people, as well as make a profit. These two factors automatically creates and destroys simultaneously. Either high quality with low distribution, or low quality with high distribution. So it boils down to what your diet will comply with, setting aside beliefs, (beliefs are what advertising is for). In the meantime, check out this book, and talk to someone who has also read it as it will make for some good conversation.The new paperback edition includes an afterword from the author about mad cow disease. But first he includes some negative response from the proper journals, such as McDonald's own periodical. I am not sure if this is to give more credibility to his own work, or make you laugh at thier denials. Either way, the afterword seems irrelevant; after going through the lives of fast food employess, production lines of potato technology and slaughter houses. The point was heavily made in the first 250 pages, while this just seems to "beating a dead horse" (for lack of better phrase).

Ok, I do know who Bart is. But unfortunately, it was not until mid point of the movie did I know who he was.The film centers a high school kid, Danny, who wants to take a cheerleader to the prom. When she turns him down, he is then becomes desperate to find a date. He already has a tux, a limo and room, but no date. This is the essential premise of the movie. William H. Macy plays Danny's father who is divorced and also in the dating pool, always trying to give dating clues to his son. Then there is Danny's best friend Camille (Maebe from Arrested Development), who wants to go with him, but he has his eyes elsewhere.Now Bart, on the other hand, is Danny's over-sized friend who has dates and, most importantly, "has a room". This was sort of just a funny way to say, "even this big fat loser is getting a room on prom night".The film is not laugh out loud funny, but it is a pleasing film. Its entertaining without being complex or too witty, or even too original. It is what it is and does not pretend to be more than that. So, while I felt the film was watchable, this is not something I would come back to. In fact, if you are considering buying, I would make it a rental instead, you will be more satisfied with it.

This book is just a book, but a better book than its successor of the same title by Richard Osborne. Mostly because it does not hang onto the relationship between Jung and Freud as long and focuses more on the theories of Freud. In fact, what I really enjoyed about this book is that gave a good round about summary of most of Freuds theories inside each book. Certainly acts a good stepping stone for those who need to know Freud in a hurry and wants the gist of his work. Richard Appignanesi displays good understanding of Freuds work and summarizes it well and concise. Reccomended for the prodigal psychologist.

A highly erotic, exotic and curious manuel written in the 16th century is the Perfumed Garden of the Cheikh Nefzaoui. This book was reccomended to me in the readings of Aleister Crowley on one of his many discourses on sexual magic. The purpose of the Perfumed Garden is to inform the individual of &quot;proper&quot; sexual practice, the wheres and whens and know-hows and know-whos. Describing all sorts of positions (and the author comments that the reader is welcome to make up their own), to the different sizes and shapes of the male and female genitals (amazon forbids me to say those dirty nasty words). In almost each instance, the author gives a story in how to seduce a woman and what to do with her once you have. When not to fornicate and what to consider once you have. The book does have a male bias, as it is written from a male point of view, and being that of the Arabian society, men were the seekers or the hunters while women were the focus. It would appear that women have less of an option in many cases, however, there is respect given to the women as they dont neccesarily have to &quot;give it up&quot; when a man wants her, but rather the man has to &quot;win&quot; her over. It is the womans job to look as beautiful as she can (personality not included). Sadly, at least, being a male I like to think it sad, that the author does give the message that any male ample enough in their virility to make a womans eyes pop out of her head and their jaws drop to their knees can win any women. Yet, the Perfumed Garden does not by any means neglect technique, which as modern day sexologists would agree is primary for any sexual compatability from both sides of the court to exist harmoniously. A good companion to the Karma Sutra, the well known Hindu Manuel of Erotology. I enjoyed the book purely for the erotica involved, which I found completely stimulating in all areas of the body. I also found it curious and practical in many ways that it can spice anyones life, as well as make one think about size; length, width and depth...and of course, their compatability.

The Excorcist had such a powerful impact on the American psyche at the release in 1973, that it is difficult for the average person to separate those images of Regan from anything else related to the idea of "possession." Thomas B. Allen comments upon this fact, however, does little to differentiate it as well. The thrust of the book is a well documented "biography" of the events that led "Robbie" into a frenzied state later defined as demonic possession. While some of the facts are interesting, and much can be brought out of this book, it is generally a slow and dry read. Allen illuminates the mysteries that have surrounded this story that occured sometime in 1949, where a little boy began ranting and raving with maniacal noises of a beastly nature, as well as paranormal events of either psychic or poltergeist in nature. Allen does a good job explaining the most well developed and studied cases of demonic possession of psychologist T. K. Oesterreich. Essentially there are 3 stages, which seemed to be present in this case of Robbie: 1)infestation, usually of sounds, rappings, in the environment, 2) obsession, where the subject inherits the spirit, and 3) possession, the take over, or new identity. In Robbie's case, all of these elements seem to be in place, and once the biological, mental and paranormal were exhausted as a possible cause, then one had to look to the spiritual, in which we need an exorcist. This is the story that inspired William Peter Blatty's now classic horror 'The Exorcist.' While the latter has much more to offer in the way of entertainment, it is in exaggerated form. Some elements of, say, voice distortion, physiological changes, markings on the body are present in the case of Robbie, they do not go to the extremes of Regan of a full-blown physical make over.Thomas B. Allen succeeded in making the right connections about the history of the case, however, his retelling needs a spark of life to make it more interesting. Aside from this, a complaint I want to make is the about the publishing. While the pages are good quality and the printing is clean, there seems to be some confusion in the pagination. Once the story is finished, he ends it with the authentic reproduction of the diary that was written on the days of the exorcism in 1949. Following the diary is the author's endnote. Then the puzzling part - a blank page on the left side, and quarter of a page of something about Robbie that begins in the middle of the sentence. The pages follow 296-297. Then to the bibliography, sources, chapter notes, ending with an index. The page 297 seems to come from nowhere, as there is no other page I noticed that was incomplete. What is this mysterious page? Its quite possible that my copy is a fluke, but based on the page numbers, I sincerely doubt this.I reccomend this book to those that are curious of possession and certainly adds to anyones study in demonic possession a supposedly authentic case. Many of the details are still shrouded in secrecy, mystery and history. Those that were alive at the time are either dead or unwilling to talk. "Robbie" whose name is never revealed apparently is still living, but laregly unaware of the events and therefore does not have much to say about it.

Anything by these two wonderful authors and amazing animators should be a must in anyone's collection. Yet, I am baffled that all of their books are currently out of print. I am sure one will not have trouble looking at a used bookstore for a copy of this. This book deals precisely with what the title says: The Disney Villians. In their usual classic and lucid style, the authors discuss the troubles they ran while devising a villian. One that is wicked, yet appealing to the audience. Going through their catalog of movies from Snow White to Aladdin, they discuss in detail what a villian is all about, and how the villian relates to the story, style and main character of each film. Whether one should be more realistic, or have harder edges, or what kind of mannerisms will this villian have. Highly reccomended for the animator and artist, as well as the Disney book lover as these are presented so well. For the enthuseist, which I also own, there is also a more expensive version of this book, hardcover with a slipcase, signed by each of the authors and a print of the filmstrip from Snow White.

Of course the question begs, why is David Mamet teaching us how to direct? In one instance, aside from the films he has directed, his expertise and notariety is in writing the script or even the play for the theater. On the other hand, when a good writer has control of his craft, it will be written well enough for any director who takes the script and turn out similar products (either to each other, or even to the script writers vision). Yet, Mamet discloses himself as a competent teacher and director. Its a short book, but there is some good practical information that is discussed, and with student dialogue Q&amp;A to give a sort of &quot;interactive understanding&quot; of how to write and direct a film. On the other hand, Mamet is dogmatic about his approach to the craft and the student answers are all wrong unless answered, not only correct, but the way he wants you to answer them, that is, what he knows to be correct. The dilemma I personally have with all books about writing or directing is they are from a single perspective and allow very little intuition or personal style to interfere. This book is, for the most part, no exception when one has to meet Mamet's standards for what is right or wrong. Given the fact that it works for David, it does not mean it will work for everyone. The trick is to take it all with a grain of salt and skim it off the top. Take what appeals to you and what feels good and what can be applicable to your writing. Its a short book that is clear and concise which is based on lectures given at Columbia University. One of the better books on the subject, so if you feel you need a little more study before you write, I would reccomend this one (although not before Lajos Egris book Art of Dramatic Writing).

It's nice to see Andy Garcia again, even in this modest effort of a New York family who has secrets all to be revealed in due time. Generally, I found the film slow and even at times boring. But it did not catch my attention until about the final 30 minutes. I wont reveal anything here, but I found it got intense and dramatic.Would I recommend this? I think for some people who like to get a taste of New York culture outside of popular Manhattan, its not a bad film. For me, I found it mediocre and easily forgettable. If time is something of a concern and you have to be choosy about the movies you want to see, there are much better films out there.

Originally published under the title 'Anti-Nuclear Handbook' by Pantheon Books, this book is set out to raise awareness to the issue of nuclear power as it posed a threat in the eighties (and most likely today as well). While it begins quite simply explaining how nuclear power came about with the advent of Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb in which it was used in WW2, from then on it was harnassed as a tool. It seems to have caused more destruction and problems than the bomb itself has manifested. At this point in the book, it seems to trail into political stances and other world problems. The author Stephen Croall is also the author of 'Ecology for Beginners,' which is evident that the author is somewhat self righteous in his own stance, regardless of his points. The book eventually becomes bogged down with too much information that it transcends comic book beginners status and into intermediary positions. So in essence, it was not an altogether enjoyable read. While I dont know much about nuclear power in general, I would imagine this being an ideal place to begin as I would guess its a thorough and tough subject to ascertain comfortably.

Paulo Coelho writes another great story (one should read &quot;The Alchemist&quot; first) about love, God and the struggle between the two. When one leaves their home, family and childhood love for a spiritual journey, then sends word to his childhood sweetheart, things begin to tense up; human love for another, or spiritual love for God. A great story and well written, Coelho knows how to tell a story simply and clearly. Highly reccomended!

This is the first book of I have read in which Einstein wrote directly rather than the many reiterations of his works. Sidelights on Relativity is a two part book of lectures in which he gave in 1920 and 1921. The first titled &quot;Ether and the Theory of Relativity.&quot; Einstein explores the concepts given by Newton, Maxwell and Lorentz of the ether arguing the universe is not mechanical in nature. The other argument is the purely physical aspect in which the mechanical perspective seems to propose what is seen is that exists, and/or can be measured and proven to exist. That &quot;space without ether is unthinkable,&quot; that is, the effects of spce/time gives credence to ethers existence just as &quot;the undulatory surface forming the boundary between water and air alters the course of time.&quot; This, then, creates the contradiction. The second lecture is titled &quot;Geometry and Experience&quot; in which Einstein argues Euclidean geometry by noting the difference of experiencing and proposing laws of earth-measurement. He demonstrates this through the plane and the globe asking the reader to imagine the globe and a plane. While the plane is infinite in all directions, similarly one can fill the plane up infinately. This is not an all together accurate picture of our universe. Rather if we imagine a sphere and fill that up, we realize only a finite amount can fill up the space.At this point, I will say that my understanding stands at a finite point in which it would be only arrogant for me to claim I understood the entirety of the book. Nonetheless, I found this book completely readable, mostly due to the fact that there are no formulas to follow. My knowledge of relativity is limited and I have given you what I believe I understand. Its a short book with the writing clear and concise and logical; which surprised me hearing stories about Einsteins genius in which he is unable to explain in laymans terms. Highly reccomended!

A silent animated film created in 1926 by German artist Lotte Reiniger. Considered to be the first full-length animated feature at 65 minutes, what makes this so special is not the story, but the animation itself which sets itself apart from anything tradional or even experimental Disney has done in their youth. All the characters and sets are done in silhouette from paper cut outs with hinges to manipulate the peoples actions. The result is an incredible and unique look that has never been matched before or since. Reineger certainly has her work cut out for her as she mastered this format throughout the rest of her career. In this video, in addition to the main feature which is a story from the Arabian Nights, is also a commercial Reineger did for the German creme company, as well as a 60-minute documentary on Lottes life. The documentary is bit slow, but it does display many of her other works, equally obscure and beautiful. If you are interested in classic cinema or animation, then by all means, you really should see this. While watching this, I am surprised that Disney showed no signs of influence in their early experimental stages. Highly reccomended classic!

Robert B. Parker's first Spencer novel, The Godwulf Manuscript is a fun and sometimes addictive read of thievery and murder. While not high literature, this book is a classic in its own right, written in 1973, where Spencer became the typical cardboard cutout detective that we see in many B-movies. Witty and sarcastic, and many times flattened emotions to send the "I am not amused" lines of dialogue. While today this might seem blah to some readers, if read with the idea that this is the first of its kind in the back of your mind, it may be more appreciated. Aside from this, the story is well told in the simplest way without getting fancy. This series went on to some 12 novels and a TV series, 'Spencer for Hire.'For a fun quick read, those who enjoy mystery will enjoy this book.

Robert A. Johnson sets up a wonderful analysis of the Arthurian romance of Iseult and Tristan. Each chapter tells a bit of the story, then the author goes into a dialogue on the implications of the story. Also citing other more obscure examples to demonstrate what 'true' love is and what is the 'heat of the moment' love. Scraping the surface of some issues on social commentary in which some of the problems of marriage and relationships in general derive from out not-understanding of what love is. Robert Johnson's best work to date, as well as one his most lengthy titles (by comparison).

Vivekananda's book, Raja-Yoga, is one of the best books on the subject; beautifully written in a clear and concise manner. Although, like most books on Raja-yoga which discuss philosophies as well as practices, what is most beneficial about Vivekanada's book is his emphasis upon the effects of Raja-Ygoa. According to Vivekananda, when one masters the powers of concentration, then reads the experiences of the enlightened, then one will then take on that same state. When one knows in which direction to go, and can predict the state one is about to enter, then one has mastered concentration.

Without a doubt if you were to pick up this book, it would definately be for the chapter of the History According to Student Bloopers. Some of the funniest bits of comedy you will come across in a long time. Who could forget such non-sensical thinking from students such as &quot;Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.&quot; Or &quot;Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.&quot; Just a great read and even funnier when read out loud to a few of your friends. Aside, there is the popular court case transcriptions of stupid lawyers who are too busy analyzing words and not realizing their lack of common sense. There are other funny, funny chapters that will have you rolling. Its actually tough to read in one sitting because you will be too busy laughing (and the author advises you should not read it all at once). A classic in the degradation of the English language and one you will read over and over with a chuckle every time!

Although I love Crowley's writing and enjoyed this book very much, I am hardly going to claim I understood The Book of the Law. Many curious phrases that were scryed by Crowley, or, dictated, in Cairo in 1904 stating that the author is Aiwass (which is why there is no author of this book) which took three nights to write. Whatever the other reviews below may say might be right, for I believe it is vague enough for anyone to gain something from it. If you like style in writing, then this book is a good reccomendation if you disregard the content as being literal. If you are curious what all the hoopla surrounding this book is, dont be shy, its not a long book (50pgs), so it wont take you out of your way in the course of your reading. Not a neccessity in everyones library, but certainly for the occultist. My favorite line: &quot;He shall fall down into a pit called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.&quot; (p32)

Sometimes erotic, other time incestial, and more times than not this book is shocking and curious. The narratives of a boy, Pierre, and his minglings with his mothers reckless lifestyle. The book is a study of a mothers destruction after she was raped at a young age. It is also a study of the contradictions of the hedonic world how it creates problems and destroys rather than forgets. Its not always a passive life. Pierre learns about this and we see how it hampers his psyche into being passivle controlled, not just by mother, but by women in general. The lack of the father figure, and the hatred towards him allowed him to feel worthless. The second and third story, Madame Edwards and Dead Man are shorter variations on the same theme. A different type of storytelling than I am used to reading, nonetheless I found it completely intriguing (despite at times I did yawn). Once you read this, it will be one of those books that you will remember.

Equivalent to a Holy relic, this masterpiece of a book has inspired me, not only to appreciate Disney's work, but also the animators and animation in general. If you are considering entering the animation field, in particular working for Disney, then by all means purchase this book and read it thouroughly. 2 of the Old Nine Men, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, wrote this book sometime in the early eighties. I read this in the early nineties. I was such a good read it amazed. Not only what they were writing about, but how good the writing was. It was humerous, witty, profound and informative in such a way that is easy to retain the knowledge which I found immediately applicable. By far the one book that has stood the test of time beyond all of Disney's &quot;The Art of (Insert Movie Here)&quot; books. Thomas and Johnston give step by step process of how Disney complete a picture from the inception of the first idea to the finalized product on Sunset Boulevard at the El Capitan. I cannot comment on this book enough and cannot reccomend this book highly enough. Five stars is the max, but I can say, of all the books I have read, no other book has inspired me more in my readings, and no other book I treasure more than this one. I say, the earlier edition of this book may have better prints and color, but its not the pictures that matter completely (however nice they are), its what the animators pass on to another animator. Inspiration for motivation and creativity.

The story of the creation of the mammoth Oxford English Dictionary (the linguist jargon is OED). Our star players is Dr. W. C. Minor and Professor James Murray. One on board making working the rest of his life on the OED, while the other in a psychiatric hospital from the Civil War writing obsessively about the etymologyies of some 10,000 words. The most words given by any one single person. While the book lagged in some areas, overall this book was highly unique and totally interesting. Aside from the story of how Minor and Murray became good friends through correspondences and meetings at the hospital, one aspect of the book that I enjoyed the most was that it gave me a great sense of appreciation for what goes into the workings of a dictionary - in particular the OED. The book also gives emphasis on certain words which allows the reader to understand much better the language that s/he uses and to give much more appreciation into what one says. Profound in some ways, this book is most highly reccomended.

For you Good Eats and Alton Brown fans out there, you wont want to miss this. These seem to be hard to get now on DVD, but I think rarely the Cooking Channel shows an episode here and there, which is where I first came upon it and made me want to seek it out.Basically, if you feel like you are full on Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives, and other road trip food surveys, this may pique your taste buds in a different way. Of course - its the AB way. Not only do you get to learn about road food, but you get the history of both the road, the food and the culture along the way. Alton starts out in Georgia on a BMW bike with his crew (all on bikes, because he feels thats the best way to drive across the country). Alton has a fun and intimate personality that he brings. Its not the "scientific" brain that he uses on Good Eats, but certainly bring his curiosity about the history of the food or the restaurant. He doesn't seem so interested in what goes into making the food or how its made, per se (although he does investigate), its more about the experience of local food that cater to travelers. Its definitely not healthy food, but its tasty and its real.The quality of the video, as others have mentioned, is not up to par. It has a VHS quality to it which is too bad. But given that this is the only way to see it, its fine for viewing. There are only 4 episodes and each episode he spends a lot of time in a particular area, and because there are only 4 episodes, you dont get to cross the country. Not sure if that was the intention, but it seemed so. Aside from the episodes, there are deleted scenes and then a bonus disc which has 2 versions of the first 2 episodes with different cuts and with commentary by Alton, which were great to listen to.Overall its a great set. There is a book to accompany the show with photographs and writings about the journey which is also recommended.

Aleister Crowley's writing (in general) certainly is one of the most complex styles that I have come across. Quite a learned man, however one must realize to bypass the content of his words and see through them as if they were covers to different tombs of knowledge, understanding and wisdom. His Book of Thoth (Egyptian Tarot) may be his best work and seeming most thought out (aside from Magick: Book 4). To buy the book is not enough, one surely would need the card set as well to get the full effect of his descriptions of the cards. Introducing the Tarot in history as well as the inflential men of the Tarot. Highly regarding Eliphas Levi and his book Transcendental Magic: Its Dogma and History as one the best and classic works on the Tarot (also suggested is Paul Foster Cases book &quot;The Tarot: The Wisdom of the Ages&quot;). I would say that Tarot Divnitors are not advised for this book because Crowley does not use the cards to fortell anothers future, but rather as meditative devices to alter ones consciousness and peer into the unknown world, seeing the other universe - that is prophecy. After explaining the relationship of the Qaballah, he moves on to the deck itself beginning like most with the Fool. Going through all 22 Trumps and 56 Minor cards deciphering the cards himself and placing it in word symbols for you to figure out. Its not often one can understand this at first reading. Many readings are neccessary, as well as looking through many other books of Tarot and occultism to begin to unlock Crowleys 'tombs.' You will soon find yourself not reading it, but referring to it like one uses a dictionary. If one wants a fresh new look at what Crowley is talking implying in all of his sublime wordiness, I highly and strongly reccomend Timothy Leary's book &quot;Game of Life&quot; and &quot;Info-Psychology.&quot; The former is a dedication to Crowleys work on the Tarot told in Leary's style (which he equates evolution with Tarot), while the latter is Leary's own neuraliterate book which ties in with the former. The Book of Thoth is the most original book to date on the Tarot system and highly reccomended for anyone looking to understand truly what the cards mean, as well as Crowleyites and occultists in general. A wonderful piece of work!

Hugh Person, an editor for a book publisher, lost in love. But there are things that remind him. Yes, many things. Nabokov's prose and relationships of present and past is wonderful to read. His words skim like a rock over the water which creates an emotional gestalt. Like all of Nabokov's novels, his characters are uniquely naieve, obsessive and guilty; which you just have to love. This book runs at 120 pages, and is one of his earlier works. I would reccomend this to those that already enjoy Nabokov and his words of wonder.

Manly Hall's short book on the history on the authenticity of the Rosicrucians is a well documented and researched book. Originally published in 1949, Hall examines the original texts of the Rosicrucians, such as the The Fame and Confessions of the Fraternity of the R. C. Hall questions the author, the reality of Rosicrucian Order and what the intentions behind it was. Like many, by now, have understood that it is very probable that a Rosicrucian order did not exist in the 1600's at the time of the publication. But because of the mystery that surrounded it, along with its popularity of the time, many people claimed to have belonged to such an order. Yet, no real author was stepping out to claim authenticity or validity of the Rosicrucians, so, many charlatans would step out of the woodworks and claim they belonged to the order in to gain notice or money. Yet, this stil does not dispell the problem created by the original Fame and Confessions. Further problems arose when the Chemical Marriage of Father Christian Rosencreutz. Hall is not altogether convinced that these two books are related, nor that R. C. refers to Chritian Rosencreutz (or that he was a real person). What Hall does deduce through all of these problems is that it may be very likely that Johann Valentin Andreae is the most likely author of the original Fame. Furthermore, that Rosicrucianism is not a real order to be initiated into, but rather a state of being or mind that one attains. One book that Hall highly reccomends in conjunction with reading the Fame and Confessions is Lord Bacon's Novum Organum as he believes he points out the author of this mysterious book.

This book was given to me as a gift, and I was a bit hesitant to read it as I am not a huge fan of fantasy type books. Once I began reading, my own pessimism at first was shining which I had critiqued in my own head the writing, which was nothing incredible, and some of the dialogue was hokey, while the characters were less than intriguing. But as I read on I began to gain sense of what the book was there for. Its not going to sit amongst James Joyces Ulysses so why critique it like it would? I began to enjoy it. It was all about the action of the characters and the magic within that I found marvelous! In fact, the ritual in which Elric does to conjure the Chaos Lord was fairly accurate, and the response and states of consciousness that were described were well on the mark. I just found this book to be great right to the end! I dont know who I could suggest this book to besides sci-fi fans who probably already know about it, but it sits among one of my own personal favorites.

Before I read this book, all I ever hear of Derrida is that he is so hard to read. Upon reading this, I realized where this could be true. This beginners book is very well written and made Derrida's work simple to understand. Although one may need a basic knowledge in linguistics and Sassure, one does not need it all together to comprehend some of Derrida's work. Author Jim Powell gives a concise look into the dense writings of the linguist which I not only found easy, but exciting - enough to make me want to go out and read some of the material that is written about. Along with an explanation of Derrida's work is also a brief biography which gives on an idea where he is coming from. Highly reccomended! One of the best beginners book to date.

This show is about as phony as any ghost hunting show. First, Brad Meltzer. Why does he need to stand in front of a field of mathematical formulas as if to suggest he is a higher order of intelligence when nothing anyone does has to do with math? The onset of the stories sounds interesting that Brad gives in the set up. The problem is that Brad does nothing!! He sits in front of a green screen and does no investigation himself. He has this team of "experts" who are totally laughable go out and "discover" the truth. One guy is writing notes the whole time (scribble scribble). The chick usually has nothing to do. The other guy is the driver who seems like he is still learning his job.Most of the time in their investigation, they take some red herring and find themselves out in left field from where they began. So what they find ends up being irrelevant and has no solid relationship to the initial conspiracy. I am watching the Lewis and Clark episode and whether or not Lewis committed suicide or not. In the end, there was no real information brought to the table that was not already said in the beginning.Much of the show is already set up, even before the so called investigations occur. There is no real inquiry, its just published information. As the case with Lewis, clearly the idea of whether he killed himself or not is not a new one as there are a bunch of books already published. In fact, they go and talk to an author and gets lots of "yes's".The show in general comes off as series of smoke and mirrors. Lots of flashy editing, zoom cuts, sound effects, and incidental music to create the effect. Brad chimes in saying nothing important, but usually either retelling what has happened, or foretelling what his "experts" will find out. So everything is already figured out.I watch the show out of curiosity and to see how many holes are in the episode. I really dont find him convincing or that the show brings out any secret history that might already be written elsewhere. I have never read his books and can see he has some reputation in the field. But like Dan Brown - they are fiction. No matter how real the facts are by themselves, they are linked by fiction.The show has one philosophy: "Proverbs for Paranoids #4: If you keep them asking the wrong questions, it does not matter what the answer is."

Anthropologist Ashley Montagu's moving study of the now famous Elephant Man, Joseph Merrick. Based on the writings of Dr. Frederick Treves and the casts and photos of Mr. Merrick, Montagu tells the sad story of a boy who lived a horrible life due to his terrible dieases which grew progressively worse as he aged. Merrick frightened off practically everyone he came in contact with, while eventually settling in as a sideshow freak at traveling carnivals. Eventually being so disfigured and horrible, the bobbies would not even allow the show to go on. Dr. Treves, who discovers Merrick takes him in to his hospital to stay for the rest of his life which was a turning point, as now he would be looked on as a human, and not as a monster. More story than analysis of Merrick's disfigurment, however, leads one to realize the care that Montagu has placed in this tale. This book has also inspired a play, as well as David Lynch's film 'The Elephant Man' which I believe is a good adaptation. The movie puts a moral spin asking whether John Merrick's position as a carnival freak has not changed being in a hospital. That is, is Dr. Treves a carnival barker for the public media rather than for a small crowd paying to watch the traveling band of human curiosities. Montague did not comment on this point of view for he kept Merrick's dignity in tact. Also included are the original writings of Dr. Treve's as well as a few other papers on the Elephant Man at the time of his death.

Like the previous reviewer, I have never heard of Francesca Woodman until this documentary, which as well turned up on my Netflix queue. After seeing her work, I was really impressed and interested in her photographs.This documentary explores the family of The Woodmans, which is the parents, Betty and George and their children, Charlie and Francesca. This family is all about art and nothing else. The documentary seems at first to focus on Francesca who grew to great celebrity, especially in the past decade, for her unique and passionate photography in the 60's and 70's. It was, unfortunately, not until after her suicide that her art began to take notice.We listen to her friends and family talk of Francesca and the passion, inspiration and persistence of her work through photography, which at the time was still young in its idea of art. Looking at her works now, they do appear to be quite modern and has since influenced many photographers. But while alive, Francesca was thought of as fragile, alone, sad, desperate, needy or curious. She did not seem to have many friends, but at the same time her world seemed small. She had written in her diaries that she liked her photos to be small to create the intimacy between the viewer and the picture.In retrospect, however, the parents, from the way they described their upbringing of Francesca, was as if she was in the way of their ideals. They said they were not interested in having kids and it was as if they were an accident. In their travels, such as to Italy, she was sent off with some guide so the parents can experience the artistic world without nagging kids around. Francesca, at least, seemed focused enough at her young age to immerse herself in the world of art (perhaps learning from her parents). This is where she cultivated her vision when she would draw from the works of art around her.Looking at the body of Francesca's work is quite revealing about herself, especially when we learn of her relationship with her parents and what her parents were like. The majority of these photos are all self-portraits in the nude. One might say that the camera was the only thing that gave her the attention she desired. And her camera and herself was her world.After her suicide, the parents did not know how to grapple the situation and so they did what they know best - they did more art. It seems to me that the art they did was not only a means of expression, but also a crutch to hold on to. I dont see either of the parents really emoting on the issue. The mother said she avoids feeling any guilt (not to say guilty is something she should feel, but avoiding it would imply its there). It seemed they almost pitied her, rather than grieve. What I felt from the parents from watching this documentary is that the parents were in some way jealous of Francesca's abilities as an artist and at the same time selfish. George may have found a way to identify with his daughter a little by carrying on her career as a photographer (he was a painter previous to her death). The examples they showed in the film seemed similar to Francesca. The mother does ceramics. Although she is recognized internationally, I dont find them attractive by any means, however, thats just my opinion.I am being a harsh critic of the parents in their influence on Francesca, but there is always two sides to the picture. You might say the parents did exactly the right thing, because anything different and Francesca might not had the drive, focus and passion to create what she envisioned. She might be normal or just mediocre. But the circumstances were ripe for such powerful imagery to force its way out of someone in such a manner as it did. So while her art did not save her, she was able to leave behind her footprints in the world to be recognized, admired and inspired for those that review her works.The documentary is excellent and well done. It brings you nicely into this world that I never knew existed and was happy to explore it.

E. A. Wallis Budge's book on the Egyptian King Tutankhamen was written in 1923, only a year after Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb. The book goes over the history of, not only Tutankhamen, but also of the relgion of ancient Egypt, being at this time Amenism and Atenism. A good portion of the book also discusses the king Aakhunaten (his spelling, otherwise known as Amenhetop IV. Amenhetop being the previous name at the time of inauguration, if you will, in which the reigning religion was Amenism (thus tutenkhAMEN, and AMENhetop), which was polytheistic. Once gaining having his revelation that the Sun god Ra is the one and the all mighty, he changed his name to Akhenaten, changing the religion to Atenism (thus AkhenATEN). Many theologists, historians and anthropologists have argued that Atenism is indeed the first monotheistic religion in history which would predate Judaism. Many of Budge's translations of hieroglyphics into the English language has been argued and disputed times over, yet his books still makes for a good read. Can get dry at times.

This straight-to-video movie of the "hit" show Dead Like Me does not quite capture the charm of the original series. Ellen Muth is back as George Lass, the girl who died from being hit with a toilet seat that fell from space at the age of 18. The original TV show is incredibly witty, charming, funny and poignant about life and death, while this new movie, fails largely due to the lack of Mandy Patinkin as Rube. This is a glaring problem for the shows quick-witted humor and warmth. He provided the proper father figure for George.In place of Rube is Cameron (Henry Ian Cusack from Lost) who is a corporate form of the death dealer. Because Rube had "found his lights", Cameron steps in. Instead of post-its, they get blackberry's. So death has pushed the technological envelope. So be it. Others are back to reprise their roles like Mason (Callom Blue) and Roxie (Jasmine Guy). Daisy Adair who was played perfectly in the show by Laura Harris, was replaced by Sarah Wynter. Although she was fine, she did not have the same appeal. They should have just made her a new character.This movie does not really seem to find its center, in either the characters or the story, and so its meandering around various dilemmas that do not add up to much. Its great to see Ellen Muth reprising her role as George, but even she cannot make this boat float too far without searching for another life boat.The original show was cancelled after only 2 seasons, which is unfortunate as it was one of the better shows on TV at the time. It has a strong fan following which is why this movie exists, however, it is 5 years after the cancellation, so it seems really a muted point by now. The gesture is nice, but not necessary.Ellen Muth was surprising in this show, yet, its unfortunate that she has not taken too many roles after the original show was cancelled. According to IMDB she has done some work, but nothing prominent or worthy of mention.This movie is really for the fans. Its not to inspire new fans as the show is dead. If have not see the show, check that out instead!

Martin Umans book of, what I would call an intro to lightning (if there is such a thing). I dont claim to be a scientist or know much about the weather, however I found many of Umans boo fascinating as his writing was clear and easy to understand. Some of the technical aspects were a little above me, yet learning about the different kinds of lightning, what lightning does and what is typical to expect from lightning I found very...well....enlightening (sorry about the pun). I found it to be a fun book that was a delight to read.

&quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot; is more of a compendium to the documentary video released with the Kubrick Collection boxed set than a book of its own inspration. It's a trip through times past for both wife and author Christiane Kubrick as well as for the viewer who grew up with Kubrick's marvelous films. The book allows a deeper and more accessible view of the Man Behind the Camera.Watching Kubrick's films, one gets the sense that something greater than a single man is directing these movies. Looking at these behind the scenes photos I hear the words &quot;Dont' pay attention to the man behind the camera,&quot; as Kubrick plays the Almighty Oz in the production of his films.The book is presented in a large hardback volume with glossy pages; all of the photos are black and white. We see Stanley from an infant all the way through to his work on &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; The final pages also offer some pre-production sketches for &quot;Artificial Intelligence.&quot; It is less of a book to read than a book to look through, although there are small captions to each picture that Christiane gives the reader the time and place and offers a little insight into Stanley's thinking.With a foreward by Stephen Spielberg (the eventual director for &quot;A.I.&quot;), &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot; is designed for the Kubrick fan, but serves as a memoir for Mrs. Kubrick. As she mentions in the introduction, &quot;The photographs will...correct the mistaken view of Stanley as some sort of isolationist misanthrope out of Dr. Mabuse by way of Howard Hughes.&quot;

I really enjoyed this show and I liked that each episode focused on a particular subject for 45 minutes. The subjects range from Hauntings, Crop Circles to Ancient Astronauts, UFO's to Vampires and even Jack the Ripper. Each episode attempts to view both sides of the subject talking to skeptics and pro-"fill in subject" and scientists alike to get a more focused understanding of what it is about.In my heading, I wrote "approach with caution", and this is mostly due to the show's contradictions. But this happens when you watch the show in consecutive episodes. For instance, when I watched the crop circles episode, it seemed to have a bias against the fact that there is nothing paranormal about them and demonstrated when a team who does them "professionally" set out 5-hours to make one (and succeeded!). A few episodes later, it covered UFO's and showed similar crop circle pictures, some of which we know were man-made. Yet, because the show wanted to "investigate" whether or not they exist, did not even mention these people who made the crop circles.In another episode on Jack the Ripper (which for some reason the narration was muted while the music was too loud), I found this a weird subject, because he does not fall into the "is it real?" quotient. Clearly he was real, but whether any one knows who he is, is another question all together. Its a not a paranormal event, just something that is unsolved.The show does not answer much in the way of new information, but rather builds off of popular legends about said subject and hearing opposing points of view, with a leading narrative, you eventually determine which point of view you like best. Some of the investigation left me feeling like the shows producers know they have nothing to offer, but weave the information well enough to be more entertaining than investigative and informative.Does it make it a bad show? No, not really. It's a lot of fun and there is some stuff that I did not know about some of the topics which made it intriguing (like what the issue about Bermuda Triangle is - or ever seeing the original footage of bigfoot - both myths I grew up with, but never looked further). On the other hand, some things seem go against another episode so it kind put holes in the show. But definitely worth getting regardless (I know I sound like I am flip flopping). Just enjoy it on its own merits and you will be rewarded!

Famed psychologist Dr. R.D. Laing records conversations between himself, his two children (Adam and Natasha) and his wife Jutta. Brilliantly profound listening to the children speak their wisdom. The author points out that nothing is tampered with in the conversations besides some inadvertent ommissions. Also there are no after thoughts or annotations, for he felt he would like that job to someone else. Funny and charming, this book (although currently out of print)can make you appreciate children more often, and listening to them a great deal more. A good companion to Laing's 'Knots.' If you enjoyed this, I would also suggest Gregory Bateson's 'Steps To An Ecology of Mind.'

Before reading this book, I was aware already that the story was a hoax. Yet, the question that continued to plague me about this story is, "Why is this story a hoax, and who would contrive such a thing? And for what reason?" Growing up with this story in the background of my life, I was intrigued by its speculative nature as well as the thrill of letting the scare get the best of my emotions. Finally, upon reading it (along with being a little wiser than my youth), it became more and more apparent that the story was not as honest as I would have hoped. With the movie fresh in my mind, it was difficult not to make comparisons as well as use the movie as reference to better visualize the incidents. To do this became increasingly difficult because there are many scenes in the book that do not appear in the movie.The climax of the book, the white shrouded person standing on the top of the stairs, typically doing nothing else except pointing, would have lost credibility in cinema format. There are other instances that seemed not only unbelievable, but far fetched. One such instance was the green slime. What is this about? Lastly, the reading level was that of a lesser Anne Rule book with 'Goosebumps' like tactics for scariness. Aside from my criticism, there were some genuine scary moments. Mostly the moments that seem trivial and unpresuming, to me, are the most frightening because those are the moments in which you truly question your sanity. To me that is scarier than an incorporeal being floating around the hell of it (pun intended).Nonetheless, my intrigue got the best of me for the real story and so I looked up in the New York Times the incidents revolving around this. The Ronald DeFeo case was more the ravings of a drug addict who was out to score some cash. While it is true all 6 members of the family were killed lying on their stomachs with their arms above thier heads, they were not shot in the back of the head, but rather back and stomach area. Apparently he had drugged them during a dinner thus no one heard the shots from his high powered rifle. Finally, the Lutzes, along with writer Jay Anson and another partner contrived the story after the DeFeo incident and made him the culprit of a possession by spirit which "told" him to kill the family. So the motive seemed more like a sacrificial rite than a person after some money. Eventually George Lutz admitted to have made the story up, as was some of the testimony given by some parapsychologists who tested the grounds and came up with nothing of a psychic nature.The book reads like a novel, and will take you little time or effort especially if you have seen the movie. Any "true" novel that has quote after quote and is able to point out minute details of ones daily life 4 years after the fact is questionable to me. I read this out of intrigue from my youth, as well as my interest in demonic possession, which is seemed the author is familiar at least with the classic nature of possession. Unfortunately no new revelation came from this story other than some excitement of fantasy. A fun book that you will surely enjoy if not taken seriously.

Aristotles Poetics is a classic in every way and still deserves to be studied and used, not just as a piece of literature. Although Aristotle expresses the highest standards a play should have it can be used as a guide or premise in which to follow in thier own writings. Declaring that Sophacles' Oedipus the King as the perfect play, which would be a good companion to this piece, Aristotle demonstrates how every play should have these attributes, namely a 24 hour time limit to disclose the plot and mysteries of a story. Among other things, which would be too lengthy to go into any review, Poetics stands as a classic guide and should be continued to be practiced and be in any writers library.

This book by Bernard Aquina Doctor gives a nice history of Malcom X, a black leader of the 60's. A leader of the Black Muslims as well as the Black Rights movement alongside (and many times seemingly against) Martin KLuther King Jr. Aquinas lays the ground work by discussing Malcoms childhood, who his father was which would prove to be pivotal later in Malcom's life. Growing up poor and oppressed by the WW2 and the KKK among others, Malcom fought his way to the top and demanded to be heard by all. He was shot and killed at one of his lectures by one of the Black Muslims in 1965. Reccomended for those interested in Malcom X's ideas, as well as those curious about the black movement and some philosophies that went with it.

Sartre for Beginners by Donald Palmer (whom wrote a few of the 'For Beginners' books) gives a fun look at the popularizer of existentialism. Drawing from Sartre's life experiences, biography and influences to show how Sartre came to his theories. An easy read, although one must still contemplate on some level the philosophies that are presented before them. A good beginning book for anyone who wants to learn more about Sarte and existentialism in general. A good addition to the For Beginners book series.

This refers to the edition released by Anchor Bay. There seems to be a few editions released of this film, and I am not sure of how each differs from the other, but there seems to be slight variances among them.Anchor Bay, in the early days of DVD, were, perhaps one of the best companies releasing cult titles as they were usually of high quality remastering and the best versions available at the time (many times the first time available in any home video format). Needless to say, Torso certainly falls in that category as they release an uncut version for the first time to US audiences. Some of the scenes are in its original Italian because some of the original English soundtrack was lost. But you do have the option of watching with original Italian language with subtitles, or dubbed in English. Both work equally well. It is presented in Widescreen and the image looks clean.Directed by Sergio Martino tells the story of a killer of sexy coeds in Rome by using a red and black scarf that everyone is now suspicious of anyone who owns one. In the meantime, Tina Aumont and Suzy Kendall, along with other women, show off enough skin to let the audience forget about the killer, at least for a time.The plot is not deep or thickly involving, but does have its moment of curiosity. There are some scenes of excellent tension towards the end, but it is a little slow getting there, despite some of the gruesome killings. On the other hand, the killings are also never overdone as to be a bloodbath for the sake of gore, but plays within the means of the story. Of the giallo's, TORSO remains one of the classics of its genre.According to dvdcompare.com, the Anchor Bay version has 1 scene cut from it, but no censor cuts. This is not the Us released version which originally cut out scenes for its violence and gore. It includes 2 trailers, the US release and the international release, also known as Carnal Violence. Optional language tracks.

The setup is simple: two newlyweds, Mitch and Jen (Welzbacher and Prikyl) bought a house they cannot afford, so they offer a room to rent for Mitch's college buddy Danny (Lusk). He moves in and things are fun for the two guys while Jen gets her dream kitchen (she is a chef). Danny, who is looking for a girlfriend decides to go online for a date and suddenly, a hot young tramp Blair shows up in the scene.That was about the first 15 minutes. It pretty much makes no sense from here on out. The first actions and words uttered by Blair, and you already know where the movie is going. Her motives are so transparent, why no one in the film picked this up is a remarkable feat of creating the stupidest characters ever committed to film.The simple fact that Danny never checked to see if it was ok to have guests come over or stay the night. This might be forgivable on the premise that he pays rent, so should be somewhat privileged, but at least pre-empt the owners of the house, no? Wheres the common courtesy? The following morning, Blair is cooking breakfast for everyone in frilly panties. Why does Jen not say anything? Like "get dressed please?!" So in the course of the next 30-45 minutes, we are treated to two of the most spineless homeowners I have ever seen. Not only do neither of them take ownership of their home, but they let her do whatever she wants at any given moment. To the point that Mitch even invites her to stay at the house (I will spare the spoilers for just that sake).Jen has half a brain. But thats it. Mitch might have the other half. Together, however, there is still something not whole. Anytime Mitch is in Blair's presence, he looks like suddenly goes into a trance, as if Blair is a witch. And I dont mean that in a descriptive way. I think if Blair just asked for the keys to the house, she would have saved everyone a world of trouble because Mitch and Jen would have probably just handed them over.There are so many problems in this story, but the basic fact that the Mitch and Jen are so permissive lets them get whats coming to them.I gave it two stars as I thought the production values were pretty good for this kind of film. The acting flails between decent to terrible. The general tension and directing is competent. If the director has a better script and actors with the same budget, perhaps something better would have shown up.

Who was the Comte St. Germain? Although there is no certain answer for this, there is some evidence of who he was and what he did. However, still, very little information is available about him. Manly Hall pulls together his unique library of ancient books to accumulate information about him to compose a biography. Thereafter, a translation of the Most Holy Trinosophia along with a facsimile of the original. My only complaint about this book is the reproductions, which are muddled and hard to see. Not to mention in black and white, which Hall later gives a commentary which he remaks on the color of the plates. A color reproduction would have done this book much more justice. Nonetheless, Hall gives a nice commentary of the work which he explains that there are 12 chapters (the zodiac) and that each chapter is part of the cycle of consciousness, or levels. The rituals of initiation are described in both symbols and commentaries. Some of this is dense to read and designed for the astute occultist, and other parts are clear and understandable. Not for all tastes, however for those curious of the lore of the Comte, then it would be worth the price of the book to pick up, especially in its hardback format.

I think the reviewer below summed it well in his subject line saying &quot;McLuhan for the coffee table.&quot; Essentially this book is a list of one-liners and ideas of McLuhans. Snippets and paragraphs from books and articles. Could very well be for the beginner, but without explanitory notes (but with pictures); while it could also be for the person already well versed in McLuhans thoughts. Either way, I found it a great book as I find his thinking fascinating, curious and many times humerous. Well presented in large paperback format with slick paper and color photos, this book is a quick and easy McLuhan treat.

Alan W. Watts' excellent looks into the world of psychotherapy, in particular those dealing with schizophrenia, and a world of Eastern religion; Hindu, Buddhist, Zen, Tao. The main topic of psychotherapy the author reaches is on the subject of the &quot;double-bind&quot; where one is forced to do two things at once. And the only way a human can do two things at once is to split into two people. Thus we have the psychological break. Discussing the writings of such known authors as Norman O. Brown, Wittgenstein, Freud as well as J. Haley, Erickson, Laing, Reich, Watzlawick, and Greagory Bateson. Noting mainly that the result of psychotherapy is that of the East in their liberation. Liberation and a successful therapeutic treatment are one in the same. The individual is free from binds, either double or singular, yet, now and again able to relate to the others world, as well as the world of the self. Watts &quot;dances&quot; about saying that to be therapeutic, one must also initate a double-bind so the patient can struggle to break it by &quot;being himself.&quot; In which, as the subject refers to, to &quot;be spontaneous&quot; (which is in itself a paradox, as if someone were controlling you to do something without thinking). Watts concludes in his classic style discussing the liberation from the self in which words are constantly changing no matter where you are going or coming from. Vernaculars and lexicons are part of the moment, not something to be restricted in time; like all things to be - live in the moment. Reccomended for the theoretical psychologist as well as the Eastern frame of mind reader.

What is probably the best part of this film, GRACE, is the pacing. It does not set you up for any roller-coaster ride, nor does it has a million and one flash cut edits, but rather moves towards its ending with a certain tone that is more shivering than horrific.It is a twisted tale of a mother's love whose power exceeds that of anyone's imagination. After a tragic accident leaving the unborn baby lifeless inside her, Madeline Matheson (Jordan Ladd) decides to carry out the term of her pregnancy with a mid-wife. Once born, however, her love has brought back the child to life - but with unexpected consequences. Once the grandmother gets curious to see the child, things start to get a little bit more complicated.The child seems to no longer need mothers milk, but rather blood to sustain its life. Very eerie and strange what a mother will go through to satisfy her child, and here is a film that will make you wonder to what extent you might go to save your child.GRACE is well made and designed, and put together by first time director Paul Solet who also wrote the script, is a satisfying entry into the horror genre. Although there is plenty of blood in this film, it is not really a gory film, nor do I get the sense that this film is attempting at exploiting the genre in any way, which is why it came off more genuine than other horror films. I think the film could be worked out to be scarier, perhaps by building more emotional connection to the characters as they seemed a little on the two dimensional side. They had motivations for their actions, but they did not seem to be based on anything other than because the script said so.For me, this title is a better rental than buying as I dont feel like its a movie I would return to often. I might give it one more watch to flesh out my thoughts on it, but otherwise it did not leave me with a great impression, other than that it has greater potential than what is presented.

Although this book was highly informative and well written, it was not an easy read, nor an entirely pleasant one. I believe the reason mainly is for the dry and, certainly, scholarly translation. Nonetheless, it proved to be very helpful for me, and surely for those practicing Yoga of all sorts, whether it be Bhakti, Raja, Jnana or Hatha Yoga. It also includes the main doctrine of the Yoga student, as well as the disciplines involved. Within, one will also find positions in which to meditate and the diet one must take on. All in the frame of 90 pages, this book will surely enlighten those interested and will get a deeper understanding of the practice. The book is broken up into 5 chapters with some odd number of aphorisms. Along with each aphorism is the original Sanskrit text inbetween. I do highly reccomend the works of Vivikananda as well as &quot;Hatha-Yoga Pradipika&quot; by Vishnu-devananda. A book to be studied upon rather than just read, indeed!

Paul Thomas Anderson is possibly one of the best young directors to come along in some time (Where is that Quentin fellow?). His second feature film Boogie Nights says everything about his style, camera work and story telling with in-depth characters and dry subtle humor. The film about a group of out castes who are in the porno business all looking for a family, where they find comfort with &quot;their own kind.&quot; If I had any comments on the film, it would be that its a little lengthy where I did not feel it needed to be as long as it did. Some slow moments, however it does not take away from the picture as a whole. Wahlberg, Reynolds, Moore and so many others that played such a tremendous role - some of the best acting in a film. The DVD sounds and looks excellent. This is one of the first DVD's I bought, and with so many extras, one cannot go wrong in buying this. The commentary is monotnous. I would have expected to hear more interesting commentary from P. T. Anderson, but he catches a word and rambles off in another direction with a dry boring voice. Not a good speaker, but a great director. Highly reccomended!

This set of mailing labels from Avery is a nice set where you get 100 sheets with 30 labels on each sheet. While they are good for envelopes, they are the suggested size for current Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) sellers, which is what I find value in. I dont send many letters or cards out, so using it for FBA.As said, Avery is the standard in the label making department. They are not the only ones, but outside of Amazon, they are at Target, Staples, and Office Depot among others. But honestly - the price that Amazon is currently offering, at 71% off at the time of this writing, you can get 100 sheets for $[...]bucks, which is what you would pay for 25 sheets at any other place. So its the best deal you are going to get!!There are tons of different sizes for all different reasons. This set advertises that they are the "send to" address type label which is a perfect size. As usual, you might meet up with the issue of only needing a few labels for addresses or whatever project you are doing and you have the rest of the sheet to deal with. Its not always easy to feed printers and set it up to utilize the rest of the sheet.I like Avery and tend to get their stuff as they print best on the sheet and they are most accessible in a pinch.

Possibly one of Crowley's most influential works, this short book of four short stories is clearly a master in prose, poetry, language and the elusive. 'Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law' is not the subject here, but rather a symbolic IT is also a tell-tale of the fobidden knowledge for those that know and those that dont know.

David Blatners book on the history of Pi is inspiring and concise. Going through the history, East and West, where the reader the will discover all the errors in formulating this most mysterious infinite number. Blatner also discusses how to remember the number, if need be, as well as some tidbits of information where pi has shown up, either in movies or books or wherever. The book essentially avoids mathematical equations, although they are displayed to those that understand them, the book is written so anyone can appreciate the the work involved in getting to pi. A fun read and reccomended as an introduction to finding the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter of a circle.

Beginners books sets out to simplify Foucaults work and essentially does so. Sometimes almost too simple. I enjoyed the material, as I had no clue what Foucault was about previous to reading, however, I also felt the writing was a little too sparse. The pictures are nice, which makes this series attractive, yet, they filled the page often with splash words and large fonts which sometimes seemed unnecessary or only to fill a page. Regardless, the text is good and informative and reccomended for anyone who is interested in reading Foucault for the first time but does not know where to begin.

Stacy Combs Lynch has given a beginners book on Classic Music, however I am not sure what age group the beginners have to be. Although there is some interesting information here, it seems as though something is missing in this book. Perhaps its not focused enough, for the idea of Classical Music alone can be very broad. She carts down the famous composers dedicating a page or two to each of them pertaining to different eras and different classical styles. Once in a while there is be an interuption in what a particular style or instrument does. Overall the book is brief and could have been better with more information. A better book is &quot;Classical Music (Teach Yourself&quot;.

Although this book does not give a full account of Freud's works and theories, it does give a credible attempt at looking at the life, works and influences of his works. Starting out with a biography of Dr. Frued, the family affair, the education, as well as his associates. Soon looking in to the psychological theories of his works. His relationship and hardship with Dr. Carl Jung, and so many of the followers Freud had, lost and kept in his battle of Judaism and Nazism. Well accounted, fun and easy to read which makes the learning fun and easy as well. Reccomended to anyone curious about Freud without beign bogged down with technical and scholarly works. This is a good companion to Jung and Adler for Beginners. One can't also neglect &quot;A Primer for Freudian Psychology.&quot;

David Brizer's book on the introduction to Pyschiatry is an interesting perspective which attempts to show Freud running about a psuedo-land of Oz. From the ancient days of boring a hole in ones head to let out the demons to the current trend of shoving pills down ones throat. The author definately condones the use of medication over therapeutic style treatment, where medication is used in moderation and speculation. Basically this is a crash course in the history and practice of psychiatry, which for such a complex subject, you may think the author would take it at a slower pace. Yet, as an introduction, one is expected to move to another book with more detail and moderation. Reccomended for the curious and those thinking about the field of psychiatry. Also, at this point the book is somewhat dated, in which it needs to be up-dated.

So here is Peter Bagdonovich's first film which also has him in a supporting role as Sammy Michaels, said to be named after Samuel Fuller, who helped on the screenplay without taking payment or screen credit. So the name serves as an homage. Sammy is friend to Byron Orlock, classic horror film actor who is ready to announce his retirement from film.This relationship is juxtaposed with a Vietnam Veteran played by Tim O'Reily who one day sets on a maniacal course of, first, killing his wife and mother, and then later randomly sniping drivers on the highway and at a drive-in movie theater.The film is quite intriguing, even if a little on the dull side. It was released in 1967, shortly after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. While controversial for its timing, it did not garner much more attention than that. The killing spree's seem random and with little to no motivation for his actions.Other than coincidence, there is no relationship between the killer and star Orlock, which left the film wanting more, even if the mystery was engaging.***SPOILER***I felt the ending was rather anti-climactic with Orlock walking up to the killer after sniping in the drive-in theater and only slapping him like he was a bad little boy. It seemed an understated reaction considering about 5 people were shot including his secretary.In sum I enjoyed the film and Bagdonovich shows off his abilities at telling the story well, but the film needed a little more at the end to justify the actions of the previous part of the film. Certainly cult and Karloff fans already enjoy this and think those who enjoy a tense thriller might find this film interesting.

I did not see this in the theater because I am starting to despise the face of Will Smith. The theatrical poster of this film shows a huge (and I mean huge) close-up of his face that I immediately get the sense that he will sing his one-hit-wonder "I make this look good".But, as in all cases, rentals give movies a second life and a second chance. So I will give it the chance it deserves. The opening scenes, I was somewhat skeptical and put off by his character. He was a jerk, totally unlikable, and there was no comedy. Was this supposed to be funny? Was I supposed to like him? Evidently not.But once we meet the more likable Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), which leads us to his family, things begin to change. Embrey is a PR man who wants to give Hancock's image a face lift because Hancock is a reckless superhero, not to mention a drunk and a jerk - so generally speaking, the public does not like him.Soon we meet Embrey's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), and there is an immediate "something", but you are never certain what it is. And that is really the hook of the whole movie. It's what keeps it alive. I am not going to give spoilers away here.What starts out as a drunken superhero movie soon becomes something more mortal than getting the bad guys. The film gets more intimate about relationships than any Spider-Man or Batman movie has yet to touch. I am not saying this movie is better than those, but there is such a strong mythological ring to the story, that I suspect it might be ripped from the pages of of some ancient Greek story. But those Greek stories are about the lives of every human, so they have such relevance to all of us that is timeless.It is this "mythological" quality that I found in the film that makes the film transcend the ordinary superhero film. I dont think everyone will love it or see it in the same way I did, and so I am not saying it is a must see. But, at least from my perspective, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.Two final notes: Will Smith was a likable in the end as he was not in the "Men In Black mode" of acting (this does not convince me of how good of an actor he is, but more of just box office appeal - 2 different things). Second, I totally did not recognize Charlize Theron. She is a chameleon. I have more and more respect for her with each movie I see her in.

Frederick Lenz's work of a traveler and a Buddhist I found rather uninspiring as a whole. Some interesting ideas overall, but when I was done with the book I put it down and moved on. I read this book when it first came out, and I never reccomended it to anyone because there are so many other books that are better. Thats what I feel.

Like any newspaper article, events are turned into "stories." These "stories", like any silver screen biography, tells the dramatic tale of a life in turmoil. Kenneth Anger's book, "Hollywood Babylon" takes the angle of a tabloid and digs up some old dirt of famous celebrity lives and puts it into a full collection of grime, grease and oil. This collection takes a chronological look at Hollywood's finest at the time beginning in the early twenties with such big names as Fatty Arbuckle whose drinking problem got out of hand at one of his big parties after signing a lucrative deal. Moving through time to the 30's, 40's, right up to the Sharon Tate murder, which Anger recognized it was no longer "Old Hollywood."The book reads like a gossip column mixed with sleazy tabloid journalism, yet with the wit and humor of a prankster. It's an exploitation of exploited lives. To mimic tabloids further, the pages appear with large and sometimes disturbing photos of stars at their most inopportune moments.While much of the material has already had its heyday in newspapers of the times, it has a new life today where many of these actors and actresses are virtually unheard of by the general public and rekindled new interest in their films. Just as watching and old O. J. Simpson football game may have the same appeal as watching Lana Turner in her debut "They Won't Forget."The title to me is entirely fitting, as Hollywood is the "Babylon" of our society, one in which everyone has all their wants at their disposal. A place where hedonism is the religion and tragedy is only the end of a scene, for we know by the end of the movie everything will be all right. My only disappointment in the book is its cursory glance at such stars as Marylyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and many other stars that became almost a tally only to be put under a heading of how they died. "Hollywood Babylon" still fits the bill, however, as an enticing and racy read of the darker seedy side of that strange and secret society.

As I browsed through some 300+ reviews, i noticed it certainly is a love/hate relationship with this book. It is apparent who are the Jewel fans (including the obsessers), and equally apparent who is being as objective as possible although sometimes their loathing for a pop-poet is evident. I find it all rather humerous though. Personally I found the poems amusing (using the strictest of definitions, confer your OED) - instantly I noticed all the titles of the poems are the first or second lines of the poems. Although this is a poetic device, I would argue this being intentional on her part. Reading these dry montages of her life, I would take a drink of water and move on to the next to see what else she has to say. I dont have a favorite. I am not a huge fan of poetry, so its a little difficult for me to give an all together accurate critique, however I know good language usage when I hear it (i.e. Nabakov; Joyce). It is evident that her music is more inspiring for her as I feel her music and words are clearler more expressionable, refined and poetic (her first album more than her second).

***SPOILER ALERTS***What starts out semi-promising as a young man inherits his grandmothers luxurious apartment, he is being video-blogged by some hot chick on the street. He basically dismisses her and requests not to be videoed. He moves into his place and strange things slowly happen. He starts to get suspicious that people are out to get him and basically oust him from the apartment, either because they feel it is wrongfully his or some other reason. He makes noises and disrupts the other tenants in the building, constantly challenging him to quiet down. The chick he met on the street, for whatever reason she felt she needed to see him again, finds her way to the apartment. He lets her and have a wonderful dinner and commence whatever relationship with some nighttime love session. She gets up in the middle of the night to video tape his apartment and all the things in it. Then, what we dont see, she gets assaulted somehow. What was it? A ghost? Another person? We dont know what happens to her.Our mild-mannered tenant wakes up without really wondering what happened to her (or so it seemed). The whole "who is there" premise escalates to the level of paranoia as he traps himself in his apartment with handmade weapons and booby traps of his own making. He has like 12 days to establish himself as the official owner of the apartment and it took a matter of 12 days to become completely insane. Not sure that is likely, but that is what we have here. In the end, he is ultimately undone by his own boobytraps and dies by a wall of nails impaled upon himself.The epilogue: a small boy finds a laptop. Certainly, when we open anyone's laptop we go right to the incriminating videos. Right? Happens all the time. So this little boy is watching and we see the previous tenant dragging the body of the chick, apparently he killed. And this is done all spooky like with chopped up frames and blurred motion, because hi-def video cameras on today's market for some reason are able to do that kind of thing. Which begs the question - is he a ghost or is it just done for effect? Probably the latter. Anyway, as he approaches closer to the camera, he turns to it and then does something that looks like he is attacking the camera. What?!? Why is he assaulting the camera?Anyway. Stupid film.

The story of an escaped serial killer who seeks out his ex-girlfriend. In the meantime she is trying to repair her life as a recovering alcoholic who meets up with another ex-drinker and eventually start dating. The serial killer eventually paves a path of dead bodies in search of the ex-girlfriend.The title of the film, A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE, does not allude to much about the film, and certainly not what you get. It starts out with a girl being tortured, so you wonder if its another SAW or something to that effect. Thankfully, it is not, but as the story unfolds, its not any more satisfying. The acting is fair. It is not a high budget film, but this is not the issue. It is more how the story is put together. I found it to be a little "patchwork", which was a little frustrating. Moving from scene to scene appeared confusing and even some of the characters at first were undifferentiated, just in physical features.The atmosphere of the film was generally gray which gave a dismal feeling throughout the film. Granted we are seeing a type of horror film, or at best, more of a thriller, however, it did not lend itself to a gritty sense or an eerie or scary mood. Instead it left it felt one-note throughout. The emotional component just was not there on any level, so interest in the characters were left at a distance. The characters themselves could have been developed a little more if to lift the film out of its darkness, but it never rises above that.I give it three stars for a decent story if one wants to make the effort. If you are looking for a horror movie or just a entertaining gorefest, then this is not the movie for you.

I can say off the bat that I had trouble with this book. Although I learned about Schrodinger, Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, Newton, Plank, Dirac, Born as well as their theories, I found it to be a demanding subject for anyone. Although the book is an introduction, I would gather the book presumes you have some previous knowledge of (probably findamental) algebra, chemistry, thermodynamics and a solid foundation of QED. Seriously, its a good book and well written, and made hard conecpts a little bit easier to understand. Math has never been my subject so you may have better luck with it.

I enjoyed Robert A. Johnsons book on the subject of psychological femininity. I believe he makes a good point in the beginning that this does not apply to females only. I am inclinded, somewhat to believe that it implies more to males than females. Using archetypal myths of Oedipus and the Hindu story of Damayanti, exploring both their contexts and how it relates to the psyche, feminine. Not overly stimulating, however makes adequate use of psychology and mythology 'ala Campbell and Jung.

Terrence Gordon, who also wrote a book on McLuhans thoughts and life, gives a cohesive and concise introduction to this genius' work. Although the idea of McLuhan for beginners might be a contradiction in itself, one needs to start somewhere, and I suggest this one to be a great start. Citing from all of McLuhans works and some more obscure titles, Gordon makes the impression that he is very knowledgable of McLuhan, as well as his theories, being able to make analogies and modern day references for anyone to understand. This book will also give you the appreciation and depth of McLuhans work without losing the message in its compactness of thought. Highly reccomended for those interested in McLuhans works.

Chomsky for beginners is great for anyone that has picked up one of his books then tilted their head sideways in a confused state of not understanding. It breaks Chomskys work into two parts: The Linguistic Era; and the Politics and Media Era. Both are equally fascinating and well written. Profound in its clarity, this is surely a book that will make you appreciate Chomsky's thought, whether you agree with him or not. Chomsky always believed in freedom of thought, and a disgareement is just as valid and important as someone who agrees. Both should be heard. A good springboard to reading his works and not overwhelming in comparison to Chomsky's own writings (who is one of the most prolific writers today). I highly reccommend this book who wants to learn in a nutshell what Noam Chomsky is about.

Roshomon, written in 1952, is truly genius in storytelling. From Japanese author Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Roshomon (the story which I write about is titled &quot;In a Grove&quot;) deals with a murder and the trial that takes place. Essentially it demonstrates that no point of views are ever alike. The killer, the witnesses, the girl and the dead himself all testify to what 'really' happened. Of course, in such an incident, no one has any story that seems equal to anothers. Reality, is whats being demonstrated, is subjective due by the fact that no one has an all-seeing point of view. The story is simple, yet well written. It moves along smoothly and swiftly.The stories that make up the rest of the book I did not read, for this story was suggested by psychologist Paul Watzlawick who was inspired by the multiple point of view story telling. This story was also made into a film by Japanses master film maker Akira Kurosawa, which is also highly reccomended. Great story telling, and reccomeded for anyone who loves short stories with a psychological twist. Remarkable!

...I am surprised not one mentioned the Twilight Zone episode "Five Characters In Search of an Exit". Maybe this is obvious, and maybe some other reviewers mentioned it, but it should be noted that this film is a long version of that episode.The difference is essentially the object in which they try to escape, a cube that these characters found themselves in. Five characters who dont know each other, dont know why they are there, and have no reasonable exit for the place they find themselves stuck in. Yes, "Cube" is as existential as that. The cube as the metaphor for existence, while the characters ponder in various states of disarray why they were chosen to be there. This would be a highly egocentric point of view to think they were "chosen", would it not? It would appear from their lifes work that they chose, and even designed their lives to be there. Isn't that the metaphor? To be in a cubed room with 6 doors, all of which lead to another room of the same type? When life is running in circles, everything is the same. There are smags and snares that will kill you, but if you know WHAT to be aware of, you can avoid it.The five characters each have distinct personality traits and skills are utitlized to help them towards an exit. They eventually stumble on math theories based on numbers between doorways. They soon discover that these numbers are equations based on Cartesian geometry that can help one to understatd the design of the entire cube. This eventually only proves to be half right, while the larger scope is to break down a 9 digit number into factorials. If we recall Abbot's "Flatland", we can appreciate this in the sense of perception. That when the world is flat, everything is 2 dimensional. That is what the world of Cartesian geometry implies. To move forward, one needs to begin to think in three-dimensions and understand the whole from all points of view, and not just front/back. Once our young heroine discovers this, she has the ability to know where the exit is.The film in general is predictable, because the point was less to find out the exit of the cube and more to explore the existential questions of existence. Whether this be through logic, emotion or the senses, the characters begin to unravel and show their own true colors, and their own meanings. Its a sort of logotherapy set in a world by Samuel Beckett."Cube" offers many philosphical debates for the viewer who is interested in taking the time to examine its message, but if you are looking for home-spun entertainment, then you will be let down. If not from its heavy-handed philosophy, then by its monotony. I did not like the film entirely because it put the viewer in a double bind: to expect the audience to accept the alien world we are tossed in, yet if you did not enjoy the film because there was nothing to relate to, then you would be missing the point. But I expected that.

From the trailers I knew this film had something that no other 'alternative' film had, namely: a complete vision. Not one of just a good story, cool ideas, nice visuals, but was well aware of the music and 'colors' and symmetry. Darren Aronofsky's debut film 'Pi,' based on the Greek letter and mathematical formula is a superb look into a genius' nightmare. Can we really call him genius? Perhaps, perhaps not, but he was teetering on insanity. If one is insane, I would hesitate to label genius on that person (more pressure). Although it looked at the religious aspect of numbers, it more specifically was about the Kabbalah in which, like the Greek letter system, the letters pertained to numbers. The Rabbis were, here, attempting to translate the Torah into numbers to attain the &quot;true knowledge&quot;, and then chasing our wizard around town. Likewise a powerful corporation is chasing him around with superduper high speed chips for his (commodore 64?) computer to punch out numbers faster in return of his work. Although I found the math part exciting, from Pythagoras to Archimedes and so on, they were small integrals to move the drama forward. What mattered mostly was the internal world of our friendly genius. A unique resolution to low budget film making it as stated &quot;When I was 6 years old, my mother told me not to look into the sun.&quot; He did! Everything went black, then white, then he regained his vision. But he could only see the world in black and white!! This is the key element in why he enjoys numbers because there are no grey areas (and!!) that the film is shown through his eyes, in black and white. Wonderful!!! What more can a film have? I regard this film as influential with a highly electrical soundtrack that pulsates with every frame that is (almost)rythmically matched to the intensity your heart will race as things rush on. Marvelously composed, this film is like a math formula that wants to be deciphered and is fun figuring it out. Highly reccomended!!

This book is actually a second part of a trilogy beginning with &quot;The Book of Splendours&quot; and ending with &quot;The Great Secret&quot;, in which Eliphas Levi expounds his experiences of magic, qabalah, tarot and the divine and universal energies. To explain the subtitle of this book, &quot;The Mysteries of the Qabalah: Occult Agreement of the Two Testaments&quot;, is essentially there is a strong correlation between the prophecies of Ezekiel in the Old Testament and the Book of Revelations of St. John in the New Testament. As you read, you will notice that Levi quotes the scriptures somewhat loosely, however not miscontruing the nature of the text. The italicized are the scriptural, while the regular print is Levi's commentary. Within these pages are many symbolic drawings which help the reader understand some of the writings which can be abstract and elusive at times. Erudite occultists will immediately recognize some of the drawings from various tarot interpretations, qabalistic, alchemical and astrological relationships as well as magical symbols represented throughout the text. Through all of this formulaic instruction, Levi is attempting to empower the reader with special knowledge, which I will explain. First, the writers of both the Old Testament and New Testament had divine insight. That there is a universal consciousness at work in which both prophecies reveal similar experiences and visions (told in different cultural symbols). Second, the formulas at hand are a means towards the Great Work. That is, the design of the symbol is of utmost importance in understanding how one is to proceed in their Work. Lastly, that the relationship between Exekiel and St. John are only 2 examples, where Levi also gives other examples from the Hindu, Greek, Roman and Pagan societies that make for similar arguments. The writing style of Eliphas Levi is one that can easily be said of as creative and highly imaginative, but with no base in reality. Contrary one might describe it as divinely insightful, yet, ambiguous enough for any interpretation that one sees fit. Because there is no definitive quality in his writing, Levi is not for the beginning occultist or practitioner of the magical arts. While his writings are manditory for any serious magician, intelligence is duly needed when studying his works. In regards to 'The Mysteries of the Qabalah', while this being the second of the trilogy, there is no neccesity in following his arrangement, however, I would not suggest this book as a primer of Levi's works. In my personal experience, this book is not to be read, but studied in conjuction with a Greek and Hebrew Bible, and a dictionary of each of those languages for a fuller understanding as well as a to draw your own conclusions as to whether Eliphas Levi is correct in his revelation. While I am still in the course of exploring these issues personally, I enjoy Levi's work, not because I find him more right than wrong, but specifically because he sparks my intellect as well as my imagination. It allows me to keep searching for my own truths about myself and the universe.

A wonderful text for the magician and the student of occult texts. Michael Best and Frank Brightman who edited and translated this edition give a scholarly intro and many footnotes along the way which are insightful and accurate. The Book of Secrets which has been translated many times in many languages throughout the years. Totaling 5 books: herbs; stones; beasts; marvels and planets. Each giving their mysterious compenents and each elements use in magic. I speculated the use and reality of some of these 'potions' in which one can make dogs stop barking at you, or turn invisible. However, one cant help but be intrigued and curious about some of these findings. I would guess that, due to its alchemical nature of the volume, that, like alchemy itself and the language of alchemy, it is written in a similar format, one of which is written in code and metaphor than for literate meanings and intents. Each one laid out in a clear and simple formula, what the potion does and what to do to achieve those results. Best and Brightman both argue the authenticity of the book, in that is was probably not written by Albertus Magnus himself who lived in the 1200's, but rather speculated to have been written sometime in the 1600's by a follower, based on the colloquial language of the text, where many books have been attributed to Albertus Magnus for the purpose of selling the book with a popular author. Definately a good book to add to anyones occult and magick library, as well as those that study witchcraft.

Hyatt's book Tree of Lies is a fun challenge to the Self in a tongue-in-cheek way. Hyatt gives a slice of American Pie and world history and challenges the beliefs of everyone who lives by simple morals by denouncing them as anything but a lie. The book certainly stands from an aggressive viewpoint to get the reader to shake off the old skin and step into a new one, or none at all, perhaps. Some parts were dry and redundant, however, as a whole I thoroughly enjoyed this book. One of the pleasures that I found most thrilling were the ending appendixes by a few friends of Dr. Hyatt's. Introduced by Robert Anton Wilson, anyone interested in Hyatt's, Wilson's or Leary's work will surely enjoy this one. Become who you are; there are no guarantees.

A lecture that must have lasted a half hour, Rudolph Steiner's words on the Four Temperments are shallow and missing the mark due to lack of information. While I cannot really say too much about Steiner and his philosophy because I have not read anything besides this short pamphlet-like writing. For 1909, he may have understood some things of early psychology and possibly even read Freud, James and Watson, for there is definately a psychological slant to the teachings. Steiner whose majority of his work deals in occult studies does reach the limits of psychology into occultism, but not to an extreme degree. He makes some logical conclusions here and there, but not enough to add up to anything really pertinent or solidifying an idea. He reads almost like an astrology chart where one is sanguine, this or that is likely of your character. I am still skeptical on astrology, so this did not sit well with me. While Steiners work is reverred by many, I cant say this book would purport me to buy another of his book any time soon.

There is, perhaps, no authority on the subject of reincarnation with the exception of certain sacred texts, however, Manly Hall comes very close as that scholarly voice. &quot;Reincarnation: The Cycle of Necessity&quot; was written in 1980 and the information is still completely relevant. What Hall continually impresses upon the readers mind is that the belief in reincarnation is the only reasonable solution towards a better life and world.The book goes through most of the major beliefs of reincarnation throughout the worlds religions as well as cultures. Hall does some keen investigation to support that most of the religions do subscribe to reincarnation. In the case of Judaism and Christianity, he does dig a little deeper to give credence that they do support Christianity, however, this is from a theological perspective and not a doctrinal one. Hall does note that, although the general public of the Western mind does not adhere to the belief, there are no laws from the church stating it is a pagan belief either.Once this matter is put aside, Hall ventures into various topics pertaining to reincarnation from suicide, karma, free will, animal, plant and mineral spirits, to the unfolding of the human life in perfection towards the spiritual goal of nirvana. Hall writes with utmost conidence and almost cocksureness of what he says to be actual fact. There are some testimonies in the book to help you conlude that reincarnation exists, a certain amount of restraint may be called upon the reader. Nonetheless, Hall is convincing, especially after he has explained the reasoning behind reincarnation and its purpose and the attitude of the individual.Manly Hall's book on reincarnation is certainly a unique book and valid amongst the pantheon of books out there on the subject. Hall does his best not to have a particular point of view, however, for those that are familiar with him will know he was honored the highest degree in Freemasonry and that his specialty is in occultism.

This is a 3-dvd, 6-film collection featuring some of the weirdest and quite interesting cult films of the 60's. All of the films are mastered from the original 35mm widescreen negatives, so you are getting, at least, what is the best can be expected for now.Volume 1 is the double feature DELINQUENT SCHOOLGIRLS and DREAM NO EVIL. The first feature is, perhaps, the most fun and pleasurable to watch. Lots of nudity of big breasted women including Sharon Kelly (billed as Colleen Brennan) and a rare appearance of Roberta Pedron. An alternate title was used for this film as CARNAL MADNESS, which probably says more about the film than its current slate. Needless to say, the film is a thin plot of 3 escaped convicts, each with their own sexual hang-up (a rapist, a gay, and a baseball player). Once out of prison, they eventually come to this poorly controlled school for girls who wear loose fitting t-shirts and no bras practicing various physical exercises that are good for the camera, but I am not sure how good they are to stay in shape. There is a touch of comedy in this feature, but it does get pretty gruesome and serious towards the end. But you can never take it completely serious with this level of acting.The second feature, DREAM NO EVIL, deals with a type of psychic nightmare. I am not really sure how to explain this one, but it is not as titillating as the first one, so it does not follow as well (or at least, my attention to it did not). What tried to be a giallo type horror, ends up being a sort of mish-mash of strange incidents that do not add up to much. Fun to watch for its rarity, but you will probably only keep it because its coupled with the movie DELINQUENT SCHOOLGIRLS.Volume 2 features MONDO KEYHOLE and THE RAW ONES. Mondo Keyhole is directed by Jack Hill (Spider Baby, Big Doll House, and many more!) and was released in 1966. The story deals basically with a husband who eventually becomes a rapist. Not sure how these events lead to each other, but I am sure it made more sense when they were thinking about it. Needless to say, it is kind of boring and slow, while a narrator blasts off in the beginning to give you something "deep" to think about. The second feature, THE RAW ONES, is a ground-breaking film as it was the first film to test the Supreme Court's ruling that "nudity is not a crime". So, here we are basically treated to a gaggle of nudies doing various activities that are just nice to watch, but nothing amounts to anything. Important historically, but otherwise, its an easily forgotten film.To finish off the collection is Volume 3 which features THE MERMAIDS OF TIBURON and YAMBAO: CRY OF THE BEWITCHED. The first title is actually beautifully shot by writer, director and cinematographer John Lamb (Sexual Freedom in Denmark and Sexual Freedom Now). We see many great underwater shots off the coast of California (at least that's where they said they were). The story is flimsy and irrelevant. But basically its about an underwater diver who was paid to go to Tiburon to get some large pearls. Following suit is Timothy Carey (Paths of Glory) who wants the pearls for himself. It takes a long time for these guys to get moving on the story. But in the meantime, sit back and see the luscious underwater scenery. Amidst all of this underwaterness are beautiful naked girls (huh?). Yeah, these are the mermaids. They are not as abundant in the film as you might expect from a director who eventually went on to direct porn, but the restraint he showed to expose his art works out for the better. This film has an interesting history as it was originally released without nudity. Then, like 10 years later, Lamb went and reedited the film with the nude sequences and released it as "The Nude Version". Both versions are present on this set. The second feature, YAMBAO: THE CRY OF THE BEWITCHED has a better tile than a film. Sometimes I wonder if companies would just make cool trailers and forget about the film. It would be much more cost effective, and the films would be more entertaining in our imaginations and any realization. This film falls into that category. Lots of crying going on in this film. I dont mean emotional crying, but like a banshee type of crying. Lots of cultural dancing and strange voodoo mysticism. When you add all of that up you get Yambao.Each disc has some form of extra feature, a little light, but whats to be expected with these rare films. All of them come with cool trailers, some for the films themselves, but there are other films not in this collection. There is also commentary by Jack Hill and Elliah Drenner and Bob Minor.The PSYCHOTRONICA COLLECTION is a fun set to own and share with your friends. Each of these titles are available individually, but I think for the money, the collection seemed most worthwhile. I dont think the retail price of $49.99 really gives you the mileage you were hoping for, but if you can get it somewhere near 50% off for a new copy, you are in good hands.

Another series of classic Nashisms that give a hearty bellow from the gut from the surprise word-play that makes Ogden's work such a treasure. 'There's Always Another Windmill' is a collection of poems printed in 1972 (originally 1969) from Penguin Publishers, divided into two parts: Songs of Innocence and How Pleasant to Ape Mr Lear. The first a remark upon Blake, while the other Edward Lear as the has been many comparisons between the two. This being the third book of Nash's poetry I have read, and I have never been let down by anything he has written. Unfortunately this book is out of print, howevever, what is left in print is worth getting. Highly reccomended.

From Flemish director Dominique Deruddere is this strange coming-of-age film based loosely on a Charles Bukowski short story. The film is of Harry Voss, who, at the age of 12, discovering his sexual awareness. He is befriended by his neighborhood friend who wants to show him the ways of women. Together they go out, explore and try to meet women. At 12, Harry is scared, shy, uncertain to make any real advancement.The film is told in three different periods in Harry's life, as a 12-year old, then as a teenager at his highschool prom, and then later in his life when he is older and not much wiser.While some might see this film as dark, it is a great and powerful film that maintains its roots in a certain reality. It captures the essence of struggling for what someone really wants, but somehow can never have those fires kindled. Yet, the ability to continually survive seems also innate within the human.As typical with other Mondo Macabro releases, you might expect some wacky and zany film that sat underneath a pile of dirt for years before they exhumed it from some cinematic cemetery. No, this was released in 1987 and won many awards. But it was overshadowed by "Madonna, Sean Penn and Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola." Irregardless, its great to see Mondo on top of things and gives us the opportunity to see such a great piece of world cinema.The special features round out this DVD well with a "making of" featurette and a video interview with the director. As I mentioned, it was loosely based on Charles Bukowski, however, Bukowski was involved in the making of the film. Accordingly, the ending was changed from the story and to Bukowski's approval. Definitely recommended film viewing.

Timothy Leary's final media jump into the unknown world of death and technology. Famed LSD Guru, former Harvard Professor and author of some 20 books, Dr. Timothy Leary attempts to marry technology with the dying process. Before doing this, he gives a brief history of his life, the trials and tribulations. Once he discovers his own diagnosis of prostate cancer he then takes the step to make death a public and cultural issue. Attempting to have his brain frozen, or consider nanotechnology to &quot;fix&quot; himself, or perhaps have his ashes flown into space. Leary's job in this book to make the reader aware of the many ways one can die with dignity. I enjoyed this book because its the one book that Leary wrote with the most accessiblity and clearity unlike his other chaos works. The book also has an addendum from all his friends. Certainly Timothy Leary fans will cherish this book, as well as those interested in the process of death.

Lynches artwork expressed here in Hyperions book entitled Images. Although I expected to see Lynch's artwork, ones that were in exhibits or from college, the majority of it is from his films. I can admit I have seen his films enough to not want to see pictures of them (if I did I would watch the movie again). But the pictures that show his work are highly unique and from a certain point of view, quite disturbing. Whether they are &quot;good&quot; art or not I am still undecided. Reccomended for Lynch fans only, or those that versed in the fine arts.

This new tome from notorious occultist Crowley was originally two books with Evangeline Adams as its author. According to the introduction by H. Beta, Crowley was in New York for sometime and met with Adams whom they were to write a book on astrology together. Due to unfortunate circumstances, Adams took the material that Crowley wrote, reworked, omitted and added her own material and eventually became an authority on the subject. The two books by Adams, &quot;Your Place in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Your Place Among the Stars&quot; (written 1927 and 1930 respectively) are essentially the works of Aleister Crowley. This edition by Samuel Weiser brings back Crowley's original writings in their original form and in one book. In a similar format as Magick Book 4, 'The General Principles of Astrology' is bound in a nice maroon hardcover cloth book with a sigil embossed on the cloth cover in metallic gold (looks like a modified Mercury symbol). Crowley's writing at many times is elusive even for the most astute occultist, however, as in Magick 4, he is making great efforts to be clear to a larger audience. The text was written in 1915 before the discovery of Pluto, so for some astrologers that may be your only set back.In my opinion and from what I know of Crowley, the work is largely unfinished, however, what is presented is entirely a workable system. Crowley probably had the least amount of faith in astrology as a science among all the occult arts, but because he was so verse in many subjects, he is not one to let it be unexplored. Astrology seems as vast a subject as Kabbalah, as so much is written about it, that it seems that no one person can legitimately claim authority. My preference is Alan Leo's work even though much of his work is before Pluto as well. Crowley stands as a modern authority on much occult work that this was a book I could trust in giving a clear exposition on the subject.The book is broken up similarly to the many astrology books out there on the market today. Beginning general aspects of the houses, different signs to be aware of and their meanings and a correspondence with his tarot deck. Then a discourse on the meanings of the planets, rising signs, sun signs with each of their attributes and characteristics. After a large section taken up by each planey in a sign, he ends with 100 or so famous people and their horoscopes. So in my opinion, Crowley could have easily enlarged this already big work (596 pages!). In sum, the book is well presented and will look sharp on any bookshelf, and for any serious astrologer to consider this excellent entry into the large world of the study of the astros.

I cannot comment of the greatness of this film enough. Robert Redfords directorial debut deserves something to be admired. While Timothy Hutton also in his first role recieves the Oscar (as does Redford for directing, and the film for best picture). The story of a young boy, after attempted suicide and the loss of a brother, tries to get along with his parents. The mother is cold and distant, while the father attempts to bridge the gaps of love. A tender film so well told. One of the most realistic films I have yet to see. If you are taking psychology, be sure to enjoy it, you will see it quite a bit as it demonstrates many psychopathologies and family therapies that are involved. I highly suggest this film with a box of Kleenex.

Jon Platinia's book on Jung is a fair introduction. The presentation and organization of the book overall is somewhat confusing while the writing is dry and unexciting. I found myself skimming over some lines either because the writing was uninteresting, or the subject at hand. The life of Jung was interesting, but once it moved into the psychological works, it lost some of its steam. There are better Jung intro's available than this one.

Jim Powells well written book on Postmodernism is well researched and referred to. An abundance of information is here along with lots of theories through history and their theorists. Overall I found postmodernism confusing, basically due to my own ignorance on the subject, however this book brought me a little light on what it is that no one can explain, or the very least, has lots of difficulty explaining it. Some of the ideas presented here I found interesting, yet overall I was dumbfounded at some of the theories and ideas - and still am not sure I know what postmodernism is yet - other than to say I am an avid McLuhanist. If you are interested in the subject, then this might be a good place to start.

Robert Anton Wilson's &quot;Book of the Breast&quot; was his fourth book. Now printed by New Falcon Publishing under the indiscriminating title of &quot;Ishtar Rising.&quot; The edition that I am reviewing is of the Playboy Press edition which is quite different, which is why I am making the distinction. Although the text is the same, throughout the book there are pictures of Playboy Pin-Ups which add to the whole delight of the book and serves its purpose in getting across the idea of the book. The New Falcon edition is all type and a few non-Playboy pics inserted. The book on the other hand was great. Wilson makes many fine arguments about the Breast and how we should be adoring the Breast, not abandoning it, or locking it out of society as if it were the Devil incarnate which rose upon women's Breasts for men to gawk and lose their scientific rationale. Throughout history, at least from the Judaica-Hebrew inception on throughout time up until about the 20's was sex, women and any other type of so-called deviant thought was considered heretical. R. A. Wilson gives an amalgum of references and quotations and puts it together in a cohesive logical and thought-provoking manner, which I believe is his specialty. His comprehension and retension level of information fascinates me and this is one more testimony to that trait of his that he utilizes so well in his writing. Highly reccomended! I would suggest, however, that you search for this version before settling for the New Falcon edition. Although I fully support the library of New Falcon (as they one of my favorite publishers). The Playboy edition is a little difficult to find and you may pay a few dollars extra, but for the experience of it, I believe it is worth it.

The history of cinema wrapped up in some odd 50 pages by author Nigel Hunter. Nothing exciting or offensive here, just a straight up history of cinema. Although its currently out of print, its nothintg I would suggest anyone highly unless it was in a bargain bin and they were just getting into films.

This book of Information Doubling is appropriate in that he backtracks to Cosmic Trigger 1, also leading to new experiences which is a compilation of small stories dealing with the life and times of the author. Continuing forward, R.A. Wilson argues Science and its theories as a contradictory logic, discovers Korzypiski and Non-Aristotilean Logic as a means of not only changing reality, but also seeing reality as it is. A step away from Sirius, and 23's (although minute references are made, this volume focuses on Earthly problems of secret societies, from Roberto Calvi, Vatican Bank, and Joanne Hayes, as well as murders and suicides that are much bigger than at first sight. Wilson covers lots of ground here and doubles the information from the first page to the final page.

Originally published under the title Studies in Dream Symbolism, this book does not reveal anything new under sun of the dream world. Freemason and philosopher Manly P. Hall gives his take, although unique, view on the symbols of dreams. The book discusses the ancient oracles, and past dreamers of ancient Greece and Biblical tales of the psyche. There is no reference of Freud or Jung here, or even other major contributors of dreaming, however, Hall does take a logical approach to understanding your dreams. Its not written in a step by step process, or a how-to guide. Its completely informative. Basically, after one writes their dreams down for dissection, they will take something from their dream and make associations. A rabbit, for instance is fast and it hops. Its small with big ears. These are typical traits of a rabbit, so one may presume that those traits are within yourself, or how you view the world. Hall's writing style, in this book, unlike others I found messy and unorganized. I was unsure of what some of his ideas were as they were not always clear. Although I like Halls work, this was, thus far, my least favorite. I gave it three stars for his approach to dream symbolism and I personally agree that the route to understanding your dreams described here is a credible one.

Muybridges momumental work photographing animals in all different gates and poses and tests of ability. Using sometimes up to 100 cameras for a single set up to gain what is now the definitive guide for animators in understanding the motion of animals. It all started with a $25,000 bet: Eadweard Muybridge and a friend argued whether all four of the horses hooves leave the ground completely at any point during a gallop. Being funded for the project, Muybridge proved to be the winner in saying that horses do in fact leave the ground for a momentary second in their strides. The book begins with an anlaysis of locomotion, going over the walk, the amble, the trot, the rack (or pace), the canter, the transverse-gallop, the rotary-gallop, and the richochet, along with the leap and buck and kick. There are roughly 4,000 photos in this collection which claims to be the largest collection of animals in motion. It features not only horses but lions, deers, oxen, elephants, birds and kangaroos. From this development, Muybridge not only discovered that horses gallop with no feet touching the ground, but his discovery led to motion pictures, in which his photos is a very crude version of cinema today. Later he designed a viewer called a Zoogyroscope (or Zoopraxiscope) which, similar to a Zoetrope, was a carousel with slits which you look through while it is spinning to give the illusion of motion (or persistence of vision). Today these pictures are looked at for a couple of reasons, mostly as nastolgia for one to have wonder and excitement of this simple cinema, but it also is a great reference for modern animators. In fact, for those looking at animation, I can tell you that if you ask for an application to Walt Disney Animation Studios, they will give you their requirements and texts, this will be on the list. Highly reccomended for the artist, graphic, fine arts or animation or anything else you can dream of.

In Magick Book 4, Crowley gives a clear and concise commentary on the eight limbs of Raja Yoga. Here, Crowley delivers the message in lecture form (via the printed page)in his own style. Broken into two sections, Yoga for Yahoos and Yoga for Yellowbelly's, the first covering the first 4 steps (yama, niyama, asana and pranayama), while the latter exploring the altered states of pratyahara, dhyana, dharana, and samadhi. But these later chapters are not without Crowley's own interpretation through the Tree of Life and the Kabbalah. While he may expound seemingly on the latest trends in physics and mathematical formulas of the tetragrammaton, it might be well to keep in mind the states of the higher phases of yoga as they cannot be laid out in a clear objective language. This is the same reason mythology is told in a fantasy-like manner, because it is only understood in metaphorical language. Not to mention, if it was told in out everyday vernacular, it would lose its meaning as well as effect.

There are lots of books out there on the history of film, however, there are those that hit the mark quite above others. The History of Film is one of those books. David Parkinsons comprehensive book on the history of film is not only a great introduction, but also acts as a great reference or study guide. One of Thames and Hudsons World of Art series, printed on heavy smooth stock paper with color and black and white photos, one is sure to appreciate the wuality of this book. Beginning at the dawn of cinema with primitive snap-shot like cameras, with the advent of film from glass or discs, into the 20's where cinema was changed forever. There, the greats are born: Eisenstein, Griffith, Pudovkin, Porter, Lang, and so many others who contributed, not only to the art of cinema, but to the science of cinema. Once this is established, theories of film rush in and a wide variety of culture is brought forth upon the world with different forms of narrative. From Jules and Jim to Seventh Seal to Olympia to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Taxi Driver; Bergman, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Capra, Scorsese, Hitchcock, Chaplin, Huston, and Fellini. Discussing critics points of view, filmmakers take on the how the films were made as well as the influences that they would have on society and the film world itself catapulting into the blockbuster film that we have today. Also bringing out how the studios were created and who were involved in the ownership. How they broke up and how Hollywood is run today. I totally enjoyed this book and found it was well written, informative in every way. The history was kept clear despite unavoidable overlapping in time. Highly reccomended to the film student!

I read the reviews here and was intrigued by this film, so I gave it a chance. With minimal budget, I think the film was really well done. Some of the scripting and acting is amateurish, but it at least remains consistent. I might be knit-picking a bit here, but the part that really irked me the most were the scenes in the mental hospital. Mostly the doctors, who obviously have never worked in a hospital, or know any of the rules that govern such an institute. First, the main character, Natalie (Kim Tyler) is able to walk on the property and visit patients who have no relationship to her. This is definately against policy in that they need consent from the patient. Next she brings in a gift (a teddy bear) which is also not allowed to give gifts unless inspected and approved by the hospital. She ends up giving it to some other patient. Natalie would probably not be allowed back to that hospital because of that. Most of the patients are typical "crazies" who are free to walk around, which would not be the case either. Not to mention they walk freely around Natalie with no observation from the mental health workers. The conversation with the two head doctors and Natalie would never have happened, and even if it did, they would not have had that conversation revealing so much about a patient. Although the head doctor mentions "patient confidentiality", he continues at length discussing the patient who has no relevance to Natalie's life (save for her detective work, but thats only for the stories sake). He also says they dont know whats wrong with her and it would be too early to make any kind of diagnosis. This is what really threw me. If they had no diagnosis, the patient would not be in the hospital. With health care insurance knee deep in hospital policy, a diagnosis is mandated before any insurance can be given, thus any treatment. So, in sum, the hospital setting is that of a pre-war era with some knowledge of the modern hospital routine, so it comes off as ignorant.Otherwise the film, as a horror movie does its job with some decent scares, good gore, lots of attractive girls running around, nude at times, which makes for a relatively solid horror film.

What a traumatic look at a family of 1950's America. The Land of the Free is the Land of the Miserable. Struggling to keep alive thier hopes and dreams are continually knocked down by the race towards financial security. Willy Loman, a poor salesman who tragically reminds himself of the past - the &quot;good 'ol days.&quot; Unfortunately these days were not so good and the future is always better. A tragedy in every sense, Arthur Miller creates a sad look into American idealism of the 50's demonstrating that man's identiy is surrounded by his job and finances. A masterpiece!

I always found Kierkegaards work archaic in language and dense in thought. However, this book helped me work through that in laying the underpinning's of Kierkegaards philosophy in a soft tangible style that is easy for anyone to grasp and enjoy. Perhaps this book will not propel everyone to investigate further into his works, however it will leave the reader satisfied that one has some base knowledge at hand. Donald Palmer gives a nice presentation of Kierkegaard's work and life from birth to death, which adds to the understanding of Kierkegaards philosophy. Definately reccomended to the beginning student of existentialism and Kierkegaard.

Saussure for Beginners is an excellent intro to the man whom is credited with as the the creator of modern linguistics. Well written and somewhat easy. This book will surely be taken in stride if you intend to understand exactly what Saussure was saying. As a beginner myself, I found some of the theories confusing. Yet, as I found out later, it was not the writing, it was the theory itself because linguistics is a tricky subject if not approached with some caution. I dont know of any other book that would be a good introduction to the subject, not only of Saussure, but of linguistics itself. Saussure has influenced so many others from Chomsky, Lacan, Derrida, Barthes and so many others. Overall not as fun as many other For Beginners books, however there is certainly more information displayed here. I definately reccomend this book before any other books on linguistics (yes, even before Saussures own posthumous book 'Course on General Linguistics').

Gestalt for Beginners, (gestalt, which is incorporating the whole) is a great and fun book for anyone starting out in psychology or looking more into the Gestalt Theory which was made famous by Fritz Pearls. Author Sergio Sinay made a accessible approach inderstanding Pearls theories as well as close to being able to apply them. Giving a wonderful biography of Fritz from his many downs in his life to his peak moments near the end. Explaining the Gestalt approach in a lucid and simple style, I found this book to be one of the best written books in the Writers and Readers Beginners Books. Definately reccomended.

Frank Miller's work from 1990 reviving an old character from the Daredevil series Elektra, who was Matt Murdock's girfriend that died in the series sometime ago. The artwork is great, however the story could use a little more punch. Somewhat reminds me of McFarlanes work in the early part of his Spiderman series, although Miller certainly puts a more intellectual slant in his books. Reccomended for Daredevil, Elektra and Frank Miller lovers, however if you are reading the Daredevil series, I dont think this book is a neccesity, for its sort of a book unto itself.

In this short book by Manly Hall, originally published in 1931, discusses, initially, the problems of disease and how our thinking manifests problems in our lives. What may start out as a small problem many times never gets resolved. By holding it within, it infects our thinking and festers over a long period of time and eventually becomes a disease. The cure, then, accordinly, is not through medication, pills and avoidance, but rather a dissolution of those old issues by bringing them to light (consciousness) and resolving it. As he writes, &quot;If you think this fits you it probably does not; if you are sure it does not, it probably does.&quot; This is a general safe way of thinking to prevent avoidance of facing yourself and your problems. The book is designed to challenge your ego and to start correcting irrational behaviors and repetitive structures that we have developed over the years. It is an excellent book and very thought provoking, if not, action inducing.

Wonderful prose that's tongue-in-cheek throughout, Dr. Paul Watzlawicks book is a sure side splitter. Citing from real life events that exhibits silliness in our everyday lives, the author demonstrates and prepares a step by step process in which to fail over and over again and to be unhappy. This is for those that are in pursuit of being unhappy. Like the miserable and worried and the paranoid and the &quot;I'll say 'no' because I can.&quot; After reading this book, I can happily say that I am unhappy.

This short work is on the Hermetic Marriage of the Androgyne, or in other terms, the making whole of the mind and body, left and right, above and below. Manly Hall, who explains this process in extreme practical clarity discusses the history and origins of Hermetics, as well as its philosophy through anatomy. He also illuminates some examples of literature and its alchemical symbolism within. The core of the understanding is the alchemical trine of salt, sulphur, and mercury. By fusing or mixing these together, you create the elixir of life or philosopher's stone. In the end the aim is towards a spiritual life that is fused with the phsyical life. As the alchemical adage of the times was, &quot;Make fire to burn in the water, and the water to feed the fire. In this lies great wisdom.&quot;

There is no such thing as hypnosis, and this sentence proves that! If you dont believe me, just ask your self. Steven Heller and Terry Stele pulled off what magicians and heretics and witches have tried to do for centuries and were burned at the stake for. The accounts described in this book are simple, yet needs attention, care and awareness. There are some great exercises and practices in which you are not doing hypnosis. Heller and Stele both laid their cards on the table and explained that human nature cannot possibly be considered manipulation, brainwashing, hypnosis, or anything of the sort. It is language, bodily and linguil.

See Schizophrenia. See Dementia. See Hysteria. Chuck Palahniuk's newest novel &quot;Choke&quot; amusing look at a medical quack who sees the world as disintegrated and segmented, therefore needs to be analyzed like any biological disease. From here a treatment can be puesued. Yet, like the main character, Victor, his own needs are seemingly never met, as they stem from, like any good Oedipal Complex, the mother. It is the mother that holds the secret. The secret not only to his past, but also to his own psychological past that keeps interupting his sexual and social gratifications. Palahniuk has written a compelling story with a clever and witty style, one that is modern and fresh. See Fight Club. See Survivor. See Invisible Monsters. I highly reccomend this book for anyone interested into experiential insights to madness of the spiritual kind, as well as prose that has a flair for the darker side of comedy.

Ok, so the name of the film really tells you what the movie is about. It tells you who is involved, and what they are going to do. The only details not in the title is why they are making one. Maybe it should have been called "Zach and Miri Make a Porno to Pay Their Rent".But the title that writer-director Kevin Smith offers is actually an irrelevant story line and is only supportive of what the film is really about. The title is just a means of titilating the audience and get everyone all juiced up to have a mainstream comedy with the word "porno" in it. Further, when the MPAA originally ruled an NC-17 rating, Kevin Smith argued that the only reason they were giving that rating was because the word "porno" was in the title and that the film really does not focus on the porno itself, but that it shows the making of one, and that the scenes were done tastefully. So, its just a means for Kevin Smith to grandstand that the MPAA are ridiculous and are only reacting to the word porno, etc, blah, blah.In the end, the movie is only partially funny. As I said, the porno part is just an anchor for the audience to see the film. If it was called "Zach and Miri Bakes a Cake" or "Zach and Miri Make a Country Western Musical" or "Zach and Miri Make a Steaming Pile of Doodoo", the story would be the same. Would it be as funny? Possibly. Seth Rogan as Zach, who has had a lifetime crush on his best friend and current roommate works at a coffeeshop. Rogen is funny and whether Kevin Smith or Judd Apatow is writing, Rogen is going to be swearing and making lots of sex jokes. Miri, played by Elizabeth Banks, is helpless in finding the right guy for herself and instead just has lots of sex. Both of the characters come off as a trashy country bumpkins who have no aspiration in life except to pay next months rent.So what is to become of these two once the electricity is turned off? Its evident from the get-go that they want to have sex with each other, as much as they both deny it. Whether they truly like each other or that they are stuck with each other in life are two different stories all together. But now its up to them to put together their brains to come up with a way to pay for the electric bill. They cant pay the electric bill, but can buy off Amazon and have a MacBook. Why not sell the MacBook? Thats got to be at least 1000 bucks! Yeah...I know, sometimes we want to maintain a lifestyle, even at the cost of losing electricity.So the idea of making a porn is hatched and they get all the right people at the right time with enough money to make it happen. Supporting characters are Craig Robinson (from the Office) as Delaney who produces the movie; Jason Mewes (from Previous Kevin Smith films) as Lester who is an actor in the porno; Katie Morgan (a real porn star) as one of the porn actresses Stacey; Traci Lords (former porn star turned legit actress) as Bubbles; and Jeff Anderson (from Clerks 1 & 2) as Deacon, one of the actors in the porno. None of these characters are particularly funny. Nobody seems to have any quirks or even funny dialogue. The situations are not funny either. Traci Lords is wasted and used only for namesake (why bother!). So whats left?The main thrust of the story is Zach and Miri's relationship who treat their feelings for each other like a white elephant. And this is the only story that really matters (or exists). There is really no sub plot, everything else is a convenience for this story to happen. Like I said, it does not matter if they made a porno or not. Its an easy way for them to have sex and find out that they like each other more than they knew beforehand.The movie is not sleazy, even if it does rely on base humor for its comedy, but its missing something that has made other Kevin Smith films both funny and endearing. Chasing Amy and Clerks have a dimension of the characters that can relate to the other, each in their unique way that is not present in Zach and Miri. As a comedy, the idea has so much potential and who better to handle it than the Smith/Apatow/Office group? Unfortunately, this is not the time it does happen.As I said, the full title of Zach and Miri Make a Porno explains the film. When it was released, many news papers would not allow the full title and only published "Zach and Miri". When this DVD was released, similarly Wal-Mart and Target did not want the full title on the DVD cover. So yes, there are 2 versions of the title being published. But really, it does not matter if they are making a porno or baking a cake, the outcome will be the same - that its not that funny of a movie.

Famed LSD Psychotherapist Stanislav Grof gives this lecture in written form in 1983 at the Seventh International Transpersonal Conference in Bombay, India. Although only 25 pages long, Grof gives a concise, yet dense history of Western Science. Explaining the cross-overs into other branches of study, for instance Freud's theories are based on Newtonian-Cartesian physics, in which people have drives that have cause and effect. Well &quot;written,&quot; and for the most part for the layman, however, there are some prerequisites of knowledge in order to grasp it in its entirety. This book, for me, gave me a great and new understanding of what Einsteins theory of relativity means to our culture: that our way of thinking as a culture changes from A to B, to the instantaneous now A and B. If there were to be any arguments made, it would not be on this lecture in partiular, but many who writes about Western science &quot;against&quot; Eastern wisdom, is that it always seems that the West is trying to get to the East and not vice verse, which, really the idea they begin with is to meet in the middle. A good read overall, and highly reccomended. A good book to read with this is Alan Watt's &quot;The Book.&quot;

TROPIC THUNDER is finally Ben Stiller's moment to rise out of the ashes of bad comedy. Here he has virtually redeemed himself as a funny person. It is evident he put a lot of passion and thought into this film, backed by a huge budget, which, without the big budget, this film would have lost its meaning.Although I believe that Stiller has almost redeemed himself, he is still a crappy actor, and as a comedian himself, he is never funny as he over plays his roles where he is just a caricature of himself.There are 2 real gems in this film, and neither of them are comedians: Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Downey Jr as the black man in the film takes his role so seriously, that to not believe him would mean you did not enjoy the film. His mannerisms and tonality throughout is spot on, that you could not help laugh at everything he does. Just hilarious! Tom Cruise takes his role to new levels. He can sink into a few bad films - and they are bad because he takes his roles too seriously. This looked like he was having tons of fun playing Les Grossman is so over the top that you have to be in awe of his acting range. But his exaggeration is pitch perfect! I don't know anyone else who could have done it better. Watch him dance!Jack Black, the second billing of the movie, I felt his talents were completely wasted. Which is too bad. Of all the big names in this film, the chemistry seemed to work so well. Black was definitely working well with the group, but his role was of little ultimate use and his comedy was marred by his drug addicted character. I dont feel it was necessary and it was not really funny. Because he was fixated on drugs, it seemed he had no other relationship with the people and so the humor was reduced to base biological cliches.Two other honorable mentions of course is Jay Baruchel, who is a great geeky type person who fits perfectly as the scared young kid, but provides the sanity for the group of egotistical big named actors working together. And Brandon Jackson as 'Alpo Chino'. What a great name. And I loved his commercials in the beginning of the flick for 'Bust'a'Nut' energy bar. Awesome stuff!TROPIC THUNDER was written by Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive) and together they have written a great comedy that can offer repeated viewings. I gave the film 4 stars because of some minor issues I had with the film, namely Stiller. His career, I think, would serve him so much better out of the way of the camera, and instead, stepping back to write and direct. His serious and always angry style that is so prevalent in just about every comedy is way overdone and was never funny to begin with because he could never write well enough for himself. When he did write for himself, it was usually an inflated role that served himself and not the film. So I say, step out of the way Ben, you are not the star.In sum, the film is definitely recommended to all. Yeah, there is lots of swearing and even some gore in the beginning. The racial issues are all part of the comedy and should not be taken seriously.Other celebrities who makes their way into the film are Matthew McConaughey, Christine Taylor (naturally, Ben Stiller's wife), Nick Nolte, and a lot of celebs who play themselves. Just a great, fun film that will keep you laughing for the entire ride!

Possibly one of the best Beginners books I have read, Lowe and Graham give accurate and detailed information on the theories of how the English Language developed stemming from the ancestral roots of pre-literate societies to Greek, Latin, Old English to the modern vernacular. Also discussed is child aquisition of language, linguistics, as well as how the body creates noises and how we hear them as words. Simply written, the authors theron look into language and society and how it affects the minds of the people, in particular race and sex. Many of the words used are masculine forms or derived from patriarchal societies in which they appearingly repress women. Thus man is the higher sex according to modern day English. Whether or not the English language has repressed blacks and other minorities may be subjective to ones beliefs, experiences and knowledge of the language. Lowe and Graham do investigate whether the language does indeed repress minorities, leaving, for the most part, for the reader to decide if this is true or not. Well written, simple to read and loads of information for those curious to know more about the language they speak, with a solid bibliography for one to expand their readings. Highly reccomended!

Melinda (Hewitt) can see dead people. They either come to her for help or she stumbles upon these people and cant shake them, so is forced to help them. In a small town - a very small town, Melinda owns a quaint antique store, but never works for more than 5 minutes. Eventually she is interrupted by a ghost trying to get her attention where her partner/friend will have to man the store. Ultimately she is a ghost detective on the trail to find out what happened to these dead people.As the show progresses, it appears these "haunts" are not always malicious, but misunderstood. Further, it seems she has a good PR in the spirit world as they go straight to her house or place of work. And so, for a very small town, it seems replete with spirits who have yet to "crossover". A debate one might have is, what did these ghosts do before Melinda? How come they don't know what to do? Why doesn't another ghost help out a fellow ghost? How come Melinda never can enjoy a night with her friends without something happening? Ok, these are just some questions. Each episode brings its own set of questions along the way.Overall, despite the general debatable storyline, it is fun and Hewitt definitely is a likable personality in the show. While she definitely is pretty, and other other reviews say she is only eye candy, I feel she is generally toned down in the sexual exploitive area. Most of the time she is wearing clothes that cover her up. Its not towards the end of the first season that characters in the storyline hit on her and comment on her looks and you see some more clothes that outline her body.But thats neither here nor there. The story is formulaic which makes it easy to watch after a time. One does not need to see these in complete succession to figure things out, but there are peripheral stuff that happens which comes to the forefront from time to time. But so long as it does not take over Melinda's detective work. Its a fun show that can be compulsive at times, but its still a love it and leave it show. I don't find repeat value in any of the episodes and there are little surprises in each episode as they become predictable.

As Marvin Minsky desribes in his book 'Society of Mind' the Agents are small programs that achieve small tasks on their own. Once an Agent is grouped with another Agent new functions and actions can occur that single Agents cannot produce on their own. So what about a whole society of Agents?Dr. Timothy Leary, in his own chaotic style, recapitulates evolution from the first organism in which life began in the Eastern Oriental shorelines. DNA, the breath of life is always chasing the Sun Westward towards our neurological destiny. If you are familar with Dr. Leary's 24 Stage/8 Neuro-Circuit theory, then you will get a rise from this book. We have migrated from Asia to California as the launching pad into space where we will create H.O.M.E.s (High Oribtal Mini-Earths). The Intelligence Agents have already established their homes in future hive colonies. The secret to becoming an Intelligence Agent and Intelligence Increase is to SMILE (Space Migration Intelligence Increase Life Extension - the 'I' is squared).The book is designed to look like articles written from future and past Intelligence Agents, with Leary out in the wings sending you transmissions from Switzerland on his update. The articles falsely written by such neuronauts as Carol Rosin, Anise Nun, Henry Marshall, Pauline Kael, Andy Warhol, Susan Kaiser Vogel and so many others that Leary includes in the Genetic Hall of Fame (however, one must realize at some point this was all written by Leary himself). The Intelligence Agents are all working together to get you moving.Leary's style is jumbled with theories, ideas, histories, dedications, neurological data, DNA information, cultures of smaller organisms, cultures of cosmic life, evolution of organisms and individuals, occult, philosophy and metaphors compact in what seems to be a cross of 'Neuropolitique' and 'The Game of Life.' What I find exciting about this book is not so much the confusing writing, but within the chaos there is a positive code that Leary is sending to all of us, possibly decoded from his own DNA transmissions, and that code is: &quot;Move On!&quot;

While Manly Hall gives a brief history of alchemy in general, deriving its roots which seem to come from Arabia and the Middle East. As part of Hall's &quot;Adept Series,&quot; the main focus of the text is on a select few of famous alchemists. Albertus Magnus and Hermes Trismegistus did not make the list, however, thier influece is recognized. Manly Hall chose the likes of Roger Bacon, Nicholas Flammel, Paracelsus, Johan Baptista van Hemont, Thomas Vaughn and a few other more obscure characters in the alchemical world. Hall's writing is observant, yet sometimes unsure, challenging other perspectives and assumptions (such as A. E. Waite). Because of the esoteric topic there is not much literature to go by, and many times one has to decipher through code and language pattern to really determine its owner, thus giving Hall a tough job of attempting a linear chronology of alchemical history. Overall it is well researched with lots of good information for the occult historian and student that is fairly easy to read. Definately reccomended!

Manly P. Hall's Adept Series reports on the Great Work of Alchemy. Giving a brief history of the art of transmutating base metals into gold. Alchemy, from the Arabian 'al' meaning God, while chemi, or 'khmi' or 'khem' from Egyptian hierglyph meaning dark earth, or darkness, which refers to the occult or hidden aspects of this art. 'khem' became chemistry, and thus alchmey which literally translated 'God-chemistry.' This is still being disputed accoring to Hall. Moving on, the author sets on to biograph the lives of many famous alchemists like Flammel, Lord Bacon, Khunrath, Lully, Vaughn, Valentine and some more obscure professors. Although brief in its entirety, Hall gives a valid and scholarly look into the world of ancient alchemy. At some points, because of the reference to these men are so vague, Hall gives his best attempt at ressurecting a life for these men whom very little has been written due to the heretical works of the times. Reccomended!

The main thread of Paracelsus' theology is that man is the &quot;Little Universe&quot; while the Universe is the &quot;Great Being.&quot; To Paracelsus, however, this is not just a passing thought or a nice philosophy, but one to be explored, understood, and lived every day.This selction of works gives a basic overview of Paracelsus' writing and thought in a comprehensive, yet, fairly easy to digest compendium. Edited by Jolande Jocobi for the Princeton &quot;Mythos Series&quot; does a wonderful job splicing together many of Paracelsus' works together in a rather cohesive and streamlined format. The subjects range from the creation of the universe to the practice of the physician to alchemy and art in general. If one is looking for a specific aspect of Paracelsus, this may not be the book to get, however, if one just wants to read or get a trace of his writings, then there is no better book to buy.The writing is somewhat archaic, however, if one takes the time to understand what is written in the first couple of pages, then one can appreciate the point of view Paracelsus is coming from. In another way of saying this, according to Paracelsus, God and Man are intricately united and there is nothing on this Earth or the Universe that can separate the two. From this understanding Paracelsus stems all his other experiences and revelations.The introduction by Jacobi is a fairly extensive biography of Phillipus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hoenheim called Paracelsus (which means &quot;beyond celsus&quot;). Throughout the book are many engravings from various artists from his books or other various books that pertain to the topic at hand. As stated, the book offers a wide variety of subjects for the reader to chew from which may make this book limited in range as it is a book of &quot;Selected Writings&quot;, however, I believe if one is beginning to look into the works of Paracelsus, this might be the best place to start.

Rudolph Kock, graphic designer, typesetter and bookbinder put together these some 400+ signs along with a good historical capsule along each symbol. I found it to be useful when looking up a symbol and to understand some aspect of the sign, although not entirely in full, but a brief understanding of its roots. While not every sign of occultism is assimulated in this book, there is still plenty for one to be satisfied with. Most of the signs are from Early Christian traditions and those that have stemmed from that religion. Orginally these designs were woodcuts by Frik Kredel, Offenbach and Main. The font used to print in the book was created by Koch himself known as magere deutsche type. Originally published in 1930, this Dover edition is worth every penny, for the artist and the occultist.

Media theorist Marshall McLuhan does a double take on the Massage by doubling his informative view of the media world splicing effect after effect after effect. Beginning locally in the village of small tribal cultures of oratory dominance demonstrating the break of the sensorium which created a tactile society. Moving through history as if fragmented in its own way recapitulating the effects of media which broke up the senses and amputated the limbs of our physical and psychical systems. Although written in 1968, McLuhan moves right into the present times understanding first, electricity as extension of the nervous system and lucidly stating that LSD, the psychedelics of the past are equal in effects to the modern day computer as a recomposure of our being. From our computer realities, one can easily define theirs as an integrated inter-net, linking one another through digital media that is light speed. McLuhan understood the implications of Einsteinian-ENIAC models of the world and distupted the passive television view with this commercial interuption to wake up the senses. Reccomended for McLuhan lovers and those who are still watching TV on a regular basis.

This edition of the Emerald Tablet which in which Hortulanus gives commentary of the thirteen &quot;stanzas&quot; of the Hermes most famous work. The translation by Patrick J. Smith is readable with explanatory notes. There is a short introduction which attempts to give a concise history of the Emerald Tablet, then proceeds from there to read the Tablet in full, while thereafter is the commentary then notes. Not a long book, however the dialect of the times is enough to slow the reader down a bit, not to mention the dense subject matter. Its not an entirely entertaining book, but fascinating in itself is the Emerald Tablet. The notes are without references, however well written in a dry, scholarly form. Reccomended for the student of alchemy and occultism.

&quot;If there is one thing a Rolfer must remember,&quot; says Ida Rolf, &quot;is to keep in mind that Rolfing is based on the theory of gravity.&quot; This is essentially the underpinnings of the attitude the Rolfer should consider when approaching a potential client. This book which is an amalgam of the wit and witticisms of Ida Rolf more or less defines the attitude of the Rolfer, the mind-set in which one is to take as a form of preparation. Rolfing is not a therapy, nor is it out to cure any ailments, disease or otherwise - it is aimed at elevating ones health for maximum mobility. The body is desgined to move, however, there are obstrctions that we are not always entirely aware of. Although gravity is constantly at play with us every day, we do not take into account the effects of gravity on the body. In Ida's understanding, gravity means structure, which also means relationships. Not just relation of the muscles to eachother and to the bones, but the body to the earth, the body with gravity. What is that relationship? The feet has to move along with with earth, to feel the ground, rather than resist or flatten as if it were a land mover itself. Gravity can be worked 'with' rather than against, which is the whole intention of Rolfing. This book is an easy read, however, because it is thought provoking to the person who is interested in Rolfing, you may want to enjoy some of Ida's brilliance and knowledge in her work. 'Rolfing and Physical Reality' is a good companion to her major work 'Rolfing' which explains the anatomical aspects of the body that has been shifted and unset. While the latter works as a presentation for the appreciation and observations for the Rolfer, this book acts as the thread for the Rolfers mind. I reccomend one with the other and should be read in tandem.

Hyatt and Duquette put together a splendid ritual using Enochian keys and calls based on Crowley's essay. It explains the charts and tables, that Crowley 'hid' from view, in which, Hyatt and Duquette point out its mystery and explain it in plain English. Somewhat confusing in how to set up the ritual and its entire process, but overall its a clear and concise formula. One should be forewarned, however, that performing these rituals is not to be taken lightly nor to do spontaneously the moment finishing the book. As the authors condone, read it, understand it and its implications: meditate.

"Walt Disney: An American Original" professes to be the authorized biography of Walt Disney. Originally written in 1976, ten years after Walt's death, and then revised in 1994 for the Hyperion Press. The book is well written and told in almost story-like fashion tells the active life of one of the all-time greats of the 20th century: Walt Disney.Author Bob Thomas nicely builds his life from his ancestral French relatives and how they came to settle in Small Town U.S.A. Giving a sturdy view of his grandparents and parents lives, we come to understand the lifestyle and times in which Walt was born under so we better appreciate his influences. I particularly found it interesting how Walt himself can recall his own childhood with such vividness from the smells, sights and events that went on around him. Seems such a curious child but always with a hopeful attitude.Once he began working in the animation studio with Ub Iwerks, his longtime friend and extremely gifted animator as well, we can see Walt's career unfolding. The small nuances of the transitions between the Alice comedies and Oswald and Mickey always seemed vague to me, however, this book discussed those moments which became clearer. How Roy came aboard to help Walt is also better understood from this book.When Walt finally broke ground with Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse became a household name, Bob Thomas began already looking towards the theme park as Disney's ultimatum in life. As Walt began preparing the actual construction for the theme park, the author leads us to believe that everything that pre-dated the idea was all for a theme park. From this he began to neglect the animation department and the films themselves. While it may be evident in the late 50's to his death that most of the live-action films that Disney Productions made do not have Disney's hand in them, but there is no mention of how they came about either. Disney oversaw everything that went on and it would have been nice to include Disney's thoughts on various projects.If one reads "The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation" one gets the sense that Walt was thoroughly involved in all of the animated film to the time of his death, yet this is not clearly implied in this book. "Walt Disney: An American Original" begins with a conversation with the author and Walt as they are driving through the undeveloped location of the future site of Disneyland in Anaheim. It seems, then, from an almost biased attempt to demonstrate that all of Walts works were towards the parks end. If one takes a little time to catch a glimpse of what it might be like to think like Walt based on this book, the park was not the end. Nor was Walt Disney World. Certainly not Tokyo nor EuroDisney. Backtracking in his life a bit, there were moments in Walts life when he was like a ball of fire where everthing he came in contact gave him ideas and inspirations. From the feature length film to television to merchandise live-action film of just about any subject to the theme park. Walt may have made distinctions about where he wanted to center most of his creative energy, but in the meantime he seemed as if he was willing to do just about anything. Yes, Walt was a man who admired experimentation and so new ideas were never put down.So I find it unfortunate that the focus moved so heavily into the developement of the theme park and not to also include his workings with the animators in the later pictures of Robin Hood, Sleeping Beauty and others which receieve only a cursory glance. Also, his life with his wife Lilly seemed remote until the final years of his life when she must have been around the studio more often. His home life is rarely described which leads me to believe he did not have much of a home outside his studio.The other main focus of the book was Walt's relationship with Roy and their financial problems they had until the opening of Disneyland in 1955. Accoringly, they never made money of their own from the films they made due to many inconveniences such as the war, union strikes, labor costs, and dealing with the wrong people.The book offers select photos of Walt in his life, but nothing that is striking or new to the usual Disney consumer. Only one photo of the picket line in front of the Disney Studios offers a larger context of times in which Disney grew out of.It is obvious that The Walt Disney Company still exists, however, I heavily doubt it would be what Walt would have wanted provided he lived. What is most evident from this book is that Walt is a family man, and Disney is a family business. Ron Miller who married his daughter eventually came to be the CEO in the mid-eighties (the worst period in the Disney Studios history). Roy and his son Roy E. both were presidents at one point or another. Before Walt was an animator, before he was a producer and director of films and before he was a theme park entrepreneur, Walt was a storyteller first and foremost. While this is a great book and reads very well, it is certainly not a complete book. It may be said of someone like Walt that a complete biography could never be written in one book.

A marvelous introduction to the world of Occultism and Ancient civilizations and their secret societies. Manley Hall discusses different mysteries such as the Eleusinian and Dionysus, as well as occult leaders of Pythagoras, Paracelsus, Plato, Appolonius of Tyana, Virgil and some relationships in architecture and theater. Well written in Hall's usual wide range of references which add to the whole history of the subject.

Robert A. Johnson, a Jungian analyst wrote a self-help book (I would hesitate to call it psychology) on discovering your shadowside, or the being not in your everyday awareness. Some call this demons, others reflections or perhaps repressed emotions or &quot;drives.&quot; Whatever the case may be the book is a good introduction to Carl G. Jung himself on the subject of shadows, as well as helping oneself understanding and becoming aware of their own shadows that they may have repressed some time ago. Overall a short and sweet book.

A brilliant essay on the conflicts of man and his environment and how through our bout with nature it is difficult for us to see Nature has its own mind. Manly Hall explores, through various references of mineral, plant and animal texts, that these elements, or forces all have consciousness. If we are patient and observant, we are able to see that there is not only universal consciousness, but also individual consciousness. Manly Hall discloses other information on ritual practices, lores, simple observations, and ancient medicine. Short as this may be, one may feel compelled to dig deeper into the subject. One might check out anything by Christopher Bird, or perhaps some references given in the this text. Overall a great booklet, and really looks at nature in a new way allowing one to appreciate and possibly see the divine harmony in nature and how everthing, mineral, plant, animal and human are all interdependent.

Robert Anton Wilson's final part of his Cosmic Trigger Series proves that from the beginning its all a conspiracy. Even his own death was just a hoax. Can you prove normalcy beyond a shadow of a doubt? Although I found this part one of the best, I would still say to read part 1, then part 2, in that order. Wilson argues Evolution and Creationism, political correctness, Carl Sagan and of course, conspiracies. Well thought out with the reading that doubles upon itself, you will find how information adds up into another line of thinking. Certainly a classic RAW book! Highly reccomended!

Marshall McLuhan is perhaps one of the most influential authors I have read along with Timothy Leary, Alan Watts and Eliphas Levi. What McLuhan does like the authors stated is not explain in descriptive terms the media, but process oriented direction of experience. I will explain that momentarily.This book, &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man&quot; is by far McLuhan's greatest book. It is set up like any useful text with the first part being the theory, while the second part contains the practice. He explains in the theoretical part that media is the extension of man. That all things created by man have come from man's own experience. This is like a dream, in one sense, where one must determine at some point that they are creators of the dream, and therefore, all content of the dream must apply to the dreamer's existence, and no one elses. Likewise, all inventions and discoveries are aspects of human dimensions that have been created by man, and therefore must come from man's inner experiences. These inventions are ultimately what McLuhan calls extensions, as they extend our human capacity for that movement or experience. The foot can travel so fast, while the tire is the extension of the foot, and therefore can move at a much higher rate of speed than the foot.It seems that the most confusing aspect of McLuhan's theories is the idea of content versus context. The assumption of media study is to psychologize advertisments or the like. This way of approach is far from his point. He says, &quot;My own way of approaching the media is perceptual not conceptual.&quot; What he is saying is that he uses his senses to gain understanding of the media, not theoretical concepts. This is what I mean about process oriented experience, where McLuhan discusses the experience one has by, say watching television, the mode of thought one has, the patterns of thought and behavior created by television.In other words, we become the media that we have been shaped by in our culture and time. The spoken word, the written word and the telegraph, McLuhan noted, has had the largest impact on our society. Not because of their usefulness, or whether they work or not, but because society has patterned themselves after the respective media. Are not we becoming a computerized society? Does this mean we have lots of computers that run things? Or are the people becoming computer like in their behavoir and thinking? The latter expresses more accurately McLuhan's ideas.The second part runs over a select group of specific media and their implications on the human mind. The context in which they were placed in is by far the most important aspect as it predicts when a new media might arise. All media have their logical origins. If one determine the state of the world now, as it is, one can determine the way of the media. McLuhan discusses the written and printed word, automobile, telegraph, aeroplanes, bikes, routes, newspapers, automation, games, weapons, and many others that make for a highly evocative read.Is McLuhan a modern mystic? It might be a heavy title for some. If one reads well enough into his work, they may get the sense he is not talking about media at all.Understanding McLuhan's approach is about upsetting the whole sensory environment. The appeal McLuhan has had on the ages from 1964, when the book was published, is in his aphorism, &quot;Media is the message.&quot; This little phrase scratched many heads. Most of McLuhan's writings are like this. It is not about explaining it, but involving the reader to think for himself. To evoke, as in, evocative. So the conclusions must be the readers choice, either by intuition, study, assumption, or first hand experience. One thing is for certain, if you take the time to read the book twice, it will be different than the first read.I can say, &quot;if you only read one book...&quot; but those that read this book are usually of the literate group. But for me, this book has not been an informative text, but a work book, a guide, an insightful prayer book, a reference, a resource, a magical text. I cannot reccomend this book highly enough.

These symbols are more than coicidence and have little to do with Americana and more to do with A New World Order. 13 being the magic number in Paul Foster Cases essay in which he defines, by gementria and the Hrebraic numerology system which demonstrates the origins and Masonic influence of the founding fathers of our country.

Another great from Time-Life series &quot;Mysteries of the Unknown.&quot; The book 'Phantom Encounters' deals largely with ghosts, apparitions, and the scientific research that went into the verification of these entities. While science largely ignores this kind of psychic activity, many prominent scholars went on to explore the realms of ghosts and what might cause them to exist. Giving many accounts of various experiences of people, Phantom Encounters states in objective, journalistic-like manner, how ghosts may be messengers of the unconscious. Yet, without adhering to this belief, the book questions why some apparitions visit some, and not others. Why some ghosts are not pertinent to the percievers life, but to someone close by. Much food for thought, why also being entertaining as well as a great resource book.

I was a little dissapointed in this book by the fact that the authors, Philip and Kersti French told the story of the film, then discussed it, then the background of the film. The discussions about the film were minute compared to the rest. The background of the film focused majorly on Bergmans life and what was going on at the time of production that may have inspired his work, yet I dont see why one would not want to just go out and read Bergmans own biography. I loved Bergmans film, which is what interested me here, and it excited me to read about it, but the material was dry and uninteresting. There were some good insights to the workings of Bergman, but nothing to change the way you understand the film entirely.

I am surprised at how many people really love this movie and feel its a great movie. Some claiming the greatest action film, while others astounded at the special effects, some saying its incredibly emotional and impacting. For me, I felt continually hammered over the head until my senses were numb to everything going on in the film.The story, however dense or plotless you may feel it is, was mishandled and confusing. The action sequences were lengthy and generally a mish-mash of shiny metal parts. I could not tell who was fighting and for the most part, did not care. I know teenagers will love this movie and could tolerate the high-intensity-over-stimulation scenes can bring and be able to know what is going on, but from someone who is older, I found them overwhelming to the point where the action was undecipherable.The robots were more biological this time around which took away from the 'Transformers' understanding that they were cars, or at least machines, and could transform into some known image, like a humanoid or beast like machine. But when I saw the "Other Hot Chick" in the movie, and she was a robot, it became a new breed of transforming and so to me it was out of the realm of what I knew Transformers to be.The film is directed by Michael Bay who seems to put so much into one scene and have these grand panoramic sweeping shots that it engulfs the plot and through-action, that I gave up trying to sort out any meaning to the film. It looks like a cyclone of machine parts moving across the screen.The star, Shiah Labeouf, reprises his neurotic annoying character who has no other meaningful lines besides "No-no-no-no-no...." Megan Fox looks like she is in a Playboy shoot in every scene. John Turturro is the best part of the film.If I could comment on the special effects, while they are incredible, what is more incredible is that the special effects artists were able to tell themselves what characters were transforming into what, and also who was fighting who.Lastly, there were so many scenes that did not need to exist, such as the mom who ate some pot brownies and got high at Sam's school. Its not comic relief, it does nothing for the plot. The film is already 2 and half hours, why do we need this scene? Megan Fox could have been cut entirely and it would not have changed one scene in the film. Sam going to college was not necessary either. Dwight Schrute, err, I mean, Rainn Wilson, had a small and unimportant role.In the beginning of the film it was cutely set up to hear Sam have difficulty saying 'I love you' to the hottest chick in the room (Megan Fox). Later in the film, Sam is knocked out for the count and goes to Transformers heaven for a brief moment, and in that time Megan says (with all of her best emotional effort) 'I love you'. That seemed to save Sam and he came back to life at that moment. True love does indeed conquer all.In sum, I thought this was a terrible film, virtually in every respect. It had occurred to me, while watching this film, that lots of action and great special effects do not equal and exciting film. In fact, my senses were so dulled from over stimulation that I found them boring. Michael Bay had stated he was not going to do Transformers 3 and vowed not to do high budget films in favor of and independent film to prove his directorial prowess. However, temptation of the big bucks could not sway his passion for directing when he agreed to do a third part. I cant imagine what a mess that will be. I admit, I rented this movie on the pretense that it was going to be a bad film. And it was. I just needed to see how bad it was.

Truly one of the most unque sort of books I have read. Manly Hall in the opening chapter gives a lengthy discussion on books and how to appreciate them and what one should do in reading and collecting books. Paperbacks he says have sort created a novelty in publishing, as well as lost some of the finer aspects of harcover books. Granted one can argue price over quality any day. Yet many times in paperbacks much of the work is edited. Not so much the text, but perhaps little drawings, headers, borders and so forth. These, he says, are all clues to understanding the book, author, the history as well as symbols. Second he gives a list of books he feels are praiseworthy as well as ones he feels one should include in their library. Setting out earlier that one should have about 100 books for their library and set out to learn about them, the publishers, printing, dates and rarities. These 100 books should be prized books, not just Dover reprints or mass market paperbacks. As he says &quot;This author could have touched this book&quot; in which one will place more personal value on it. The books he lists are obscure, perhaps ones you would not pick, but ones he chose mostly for their historical value as well as content value. Ones that are hard to find (during the time of this books printing) as well as the originals themselves. One should choose a book to begin their library, save the money and search for it. find out the quality of the book, the condition, making sure that its in its original form (with dustjack and other accessories that may accompany it). Then he discusses when one reads a book to always have a dictionary at their side. Read for no more than an hour because your brain will begin to hesitate and slide if its strained and forced. Read for an hour, look up the words you dont know and learn the word by writing it down. Manly Hall surely has a fascination and total appreciation for, not just good books, but books in general. This book has given me a new outlook on the quality and appreciation of books today and always.

If the thought crosses your mind that you need a foot rest, then I would certainly recommend this model. Its a pretty wide (22 inches) base that gives your feet plenty of room to rest and move around, or have your feet apart comfortably. Its fairly heavy, so you know the steel can handle some weight. There is no assembly, you just pull it out of the box and place it on the floor. If you have sleek floors, it has rubber "feet" in the corners to prevent it from sliding around. The top area is covered with a comfortable, yet slightly gritty pattern that is good for shoes or bare feet.Once on the floor, it is easily adjustable with your feet just by pushing up or down. Once there, it stays snug without feeling loose. You can adjust the tightness of the foot rest with the two nuts on the inside.While simple in design, its perfectly functional and a solid piece of furniture that will outlast most furniture.

After the possession and exorcism of Regan, Lt. Kinderman finds himself in another satanic metaphysical detective case. Unfortunately, not as intriguing as the &quot;first&quot; Exorcist, there are some elements of the book that holds its own. The major problem of the book is that of the author, William Peter Blatty, who is too intent upon letting the reader know how much he knows about films and mataphysics. Kinderman is merely a tool in which Blatty spews his worldly wisdom and philosophy, which, in of itself is a good belief, however, this is not the space for that kind of information. Much of it is irrelevant to the story itself. If one weeds out the philosophy, the story ends up being rather short. The other problem I had with the book was the idea of it being sold as a sequel to the Exorcist. The only thing that makes this remotely a sequel is Detective Kinderman. &quot;Series&quot; would be more like it, as it could have spawned a number of detective stories. Nonetheless, however, it was a fun read, and the story moved along quick and less painful as the first.

Author of Nuclear Power for Beginners, Stephen Croall makes this palatable introduction to the eco-system enjoyable, entertaining and easy to grasp for anyone. It also makes many fine remarks on our food industry and health in general where ones awareness is raised to the level of conscious living. While his reference seems to rely mainly on Ivan Illich's works (Tools for Conviviality), it does express its own interests that the Earth is a living system an co-dependent no us and other creatures that inhabit this planet. Although out of print, for the beginner it may be worth searching for if they are curious about the subject. Otherwise, for those that do enjoy the Beginners series, then this one is right on!

If you have seen Kubrick's Odyssey 1, you might want to stop there. In the first Jay Weidner explains how the moon landing was a Hollywood fake for the government. Here, Weidner visits 2001 again, but basically disregards anything of the conspiracy and focuses on the occult aspect of the film. After seeing the first film, he seems to completely disregard Kubrick's intent of the film as conspiracy and instead now Kubrick was this alchemist. Which is it?Generally the few points that Jay Weidner explains in 2001: A Space Odyssey could have been explained in about 10 minutes. Instead he wastes the first 30 minutes giving a narrative of the movie as you are basically watching the scenes he is describing. He does not draw any information from the scenes, but just describes them - scene by scene. If you are watching the movie, then all he is saying is completely obvious. I have seen 2001 numerous times and it stands as my favorite film, so it was tedious to listen to him tell me what was happening in the movie.At the 34 minute mark (this film is 60 minutes), he decides to give some explanation to the film. He brings in some occult traditions, mostly alchemy as he is most familiar with it. His relationship to the Tree of Life and Kabbalah needs a little tweaking as he fudges it a little. If he knew more about it, he would have solved the issue that you cannot switch Saturn for the Sun, that section is essentially wrong. If he had gone the way of using elements (earth, water, fire, air) he might have been more successful. Not to mention he only references the Middle Pillar and basically disregards the rest of the tree.As he approaches the end of the film, we are hammered with the final sequence approximately five times in succession. How many times do we need to see this for him to explain his point? He says the floor has 64 squares, the same as a chess board. Kubrick was a chess master. But then resolves that "the monolith had checkmated him". What the heck does this mean? This was an interesting footnote, but nothing more. The floor is not checkered and there is nothing else indicating a strong chess presence. We had to watch the whole end sequence to hear that silly explanation.Watching the final sequence - again - Weidner draws upon the Cube of Space. While this was a good analogy, the monolith is, by design, NOT a cube. The cube of space is literally a cube. All sides are the same length. The monolith clearly does not fit this description.The star child at the end, as he approaches Earth, Weiner makes the silly assertion that it is thinking "There is much work to be done." WHAT?!?!?! Where did that come from? Ugh. Sweeping assumptions in his explanations which left gaps in what should have been the obvious and simple explanation that HAL is representative of the ego (Bowman's ego, the 'I' or 'eye'). Killing HAL and going through the star field was the annihilation of the ego, which follows with death in the hotel room. Then finally rebirth as the star child.It was not a total waste as he points out the sun, moon and stars being aligned (as we see the opening sequence also five times!!) were pivotal points in which the monolith makes itself present as a transformative point for human consciousness. Weidner says at some point that "the movie is the monolith". What the heck does that mean? He does not explain his thoughts and makes poetic assertions that dont mean much. The monolith as Philosopher's Stone is perhaps the best point he made. But he never expounds on this. He makes other points about some stuff, but does not thread anything together.It seemed there were so many missed opportunities to tell us something but instead just continued to tell us the story which we already know, or could tell by watching the movie. I just cannot recommend this DVD. A die-hard Kubrick fan would be irritated. Someone who never seen the film would be better off seeing the film instead. And conspiracy buff or occultist would be left wanting something of more substance. I might also point out that the production is called "Cubed Brick Productions". Heh. Get it? He even goes as far as to suggest that is what the monolith is. Ugh. Spare me.

Huxley's now classic book which gave inspiration to the rock group, is curious in that you are reading the explorations of one mans mind on mescaline. However, I cant say I found it the most exciting book I have ever read. This book certainly has its place in ones philosophy library, perhaps psychology as well. Popular with those who like to experiement with mind drugs as well.

Hyatt and Black do not describe, or tell what Tantra &quot;is&quot;. For it is not anything you could touch or see as external from ourselves. According to the authors, who display their own experiences during their practices begin to teach you, not what it is, but rather the lifestyle one lives. Like all the mystical arts, it has less to do with dogma than ritual. The doing is more important than the rules. So, when one attempts Tantra, its a breaking of old patterns and realities and forming new ones. As the author says, if it scares you, then good! It will move you out of the familiar and the old and into the new and unknown. So if you think you know what Tantra is, then think again.

Are you ready to give birth? I bet you did not even know you were in labor. Well, its time to wake up and take the test. What test you ask? The Bi-Polar Brain Test of course. Its not hard, and you cant fail either (or pass for that matter). Its a skill monitor and change and alter perceptions as you read on. What you will learn, and what I found most ingenius, is that you and I and everyone in the world are chemistry kits. We have built in pharmacies! Why go out and buy alcohol when we can produce it ourselves? Why pay lots of money for acid when your brain is primed for such a state of existence! It wants it! And so do you!! And Christopher Hyatt and Antero Alli are just the tour guides to get you to that state of consciousness. In a fun picture filled fashion reminescent of Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson with Alli and Hyatts own worldly wise witticisms that one can adore so easily. A book to run out and get at your local drugstore. Hurry,, before they sell out! Oh..I am sorry, they obviously did sell out since this book is now out of print. Well, seemingly like a lot of good books they are forgotten and the presses are held up until further notice. Check your usedbook.com store or one in your hometown, see if they got it. If they do, get it. And even more so, get Antero Alli's Akashic Record Player which is a precursor to this marvelous book!! Love It!

Unfortunately this book is out of print, and also I am writing a review under the 100.00 dollar version, which I dont own - incidentally I believe that version is signed by the two authors Johnston and Thomas. Moving on, this book demonstrates the beauty, skill and patience of the artists that worked on the film Bambi. It also shows their accuracy for realism as well as sensitivity to nature and the subject as a whole. Nothing to read here, but looking through the pictures and being in awe at the sheer beauty of these drawings, it would equal the time one would take to read an epic poem. I treasure this book for Bambi and the artwork has always held a special place for me as I am always inspired when I look at the delicate nature of the pencil lines in Bambi's neck and eyes, and his fragile legs. So innocent and pure which is the child in me that likes to come out and play. There is no finished work here, only pencil sketches of the characters Bambi, Feline, Flower, Thumper, and many others. Highly reccomended for the animation lover, as well as the animator whom will find it a great reference.

Thompson's work on the anatomy of animals, which is not over 100 years old, is a classic study of the skeletal and musculatory systems of the wild life animals. Some of the artwork is pretty, but poor oganization that makes the entire book less pretty to look at. The book shows foxes, lions, bison, horses, birds and other animals in their raw forms, with commentary beforehand, on the folds of skin, glands, nerves, size and proportions of the animals. I believe the one aspect that is missing here is the animals in motion. Thompson definately knew his material and his animals well, and this book is certainly reccomended to artists of any kind, as well as those who love to draw animals.

Lajos Egri's magnificent account and demonstrations of how to write a dramatic play is exciting and accurate. Citing master playwrites as Shakespeare, Moliere, Henrik Ibsen, and many others pointing out their high points and low points and how a play is to be constructed showing their commonalities among them. Starting at the root, and logically building up the story and characters to create a well developed play. Legri argues whether the action or the characters drive the play, it would seem the he believes that the characters are the driving force, however he also recognizes that they are one in the same, that a well developed character will alone create the action. Overall the book is presented well, easy to read and one will have a solid working knowledge to begin critiquing plays, as well as to get moving on their own stories. It would be advised to read the plays Legri refers to throughout the book, it will become more handy and points made clearer when he discusses those stories. Highly reccomended!

Assuming you have seen the movie, one might be fascinated to read a book on it. Atkinsons book might be the one to check out. Carefully detailed, this book discusses the major plots in the film, in relation to all its subplots as well as all the inuendoes that are so common in Lynch films. Not to mention the quirkiness of the characters. Overall, this book was well told and making some plausible ideas about the strangeness of Lynches world. Yet, I found it does not help me appreciate the film any better than I did the first time, or the next time I will see it.

Most of the reviewers have said well enough about how good or bad this movie is. Stallone cannot sing, no matter how well produced the film is, no matter how they silken his voice and no matter how much they embellish the rest of the music - he just cannot carry a tune. And that would probably be easily guessed by even the most casual movie watcher.Parton, as always, looks great, although I am not a fan of her music, I am a fan of her "visual style". Otherwise, the movie is pretty much a fish-out-of-water tale, by taking a New York cab driver and get him to be a country singer by hooking one of the hardest crowds around.Too many questions come up during this movie regarding plot, such as 'Are we in New York or Tenessee?' or 'How does a country club in New York survive when all of the talent gets laughed off stage?' and many others that, for the most part are not even worth trying to answer.The only thing that begs questioning is that the credits state the movie is based on the popular country song "Rhinestone Cowboy" by Larry Weiss, but not once is it played in the movie. I don't know if the DVD cut out the song for rights purposes, or if it never made the final cut of the movie. But why bother giving credit if its not even represented?Oh well. With that, the only other curiosity is that this film is directed by Bob Clark, who directed A Christmas Story, Porky's, Turk 182, among other cult films.Overall, it is a cheesy 80's flick that can be unintentionally funny, but otherwise an irritating film.

Roman Jakobson in his later years of Brain and Language studies delivers this lecture at New York University in 1980. Although this may be somewhat dated at the moment, Jakobson surely gives some wonderful insights into how language is understood by the brain, and in particular how the ears listen and then register to the brain. Written in a highly dense and technical (considering its a lecture) along with really long winded sentences that makes it more difficult to gather everything. He is certainly talking to the learned student of phonology and neurology. Citing from many examples from the 40's through the late 70's, Jakobson shows that hearing is a contralateral process. He explains this through process of aphasia and other brain disorders and some people with damaged hearing. And these works, from what I can tell are extended from Gazzaniga's work, as well as so many others who worked with siezures and split-brain operations. Definately reccomended for the language and linguistic student, as well as for neurology studies. Also reccomended is Karl H. Pribram's &quot;Language of the Brain.&quot;

Coca-Cola, the great American soft drink that suggested to millions of Americans, &quot;have a coke and a smile.&quot; Perhaps reading this well documented history of the company, you may not be smiling about Coke, but rather that this book is such a good read that its difficult to put down.Businesss journalist Mark Pedergast writes an objective account of Coca-Cola's history from its inception to mass production to symbol of American purity, with the attitude of de-mythologising some of the stories the company has sold to the public. I found the writing not only to be clear and concise, but remarkably well told considering all of the footnotes, appendices, and citations that Mr. Pendergast has accumulated to tell his tale. While the myths that Coca-Cola was developed by some poor root doctor in some chemical accident and that Coke never had cocaine in it are dispelled not to illuminate the company as a sham or to be looked down upon, but with integrity for the achievments of the company, yet, at the same time, not ignoring Coke's influence on American way of life and the individual psyche (making for it, in actuality, a better history than Coke dreamed of). Certainly, the myths that the company purports seem to be as nice as Haddon Sundblom's Santa Clause paintings where, everyday is Christmas, America is pure, and stories are taken out of history and placed in a Neverland of happy endings. Mr. Pendergast does a wonderful job of placing Coca-Cola back into American history writing how a company, such as Coca-Cola, did not arise to power by accident or love by the American people, but by greed, shrewd marketing, and religious fervor for their product.Unless one is not interested in knowing about such histories as this, or any other commercial empire, then there is no doubt one will enjoy this book thoroughly. One point I will make on this book is its title. This edition being the second titled, &quot;For God, Country and Coca-Cola: Second Edition: Revised and Expanded: The Definitive History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It.&quot; For those that are fortunate enough to buy the first edition, one will speculate and wonder about the radical and decisive change in the title. The original title reads: &quot;For God, Country and Coca-Cola: The Unauthorized History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It.&quot; Moving from &quot;Unauthorized&quot; to &quot;Definitive&quot; made me wonder why Coke changed their attitude about their own myths to the historically accurate. Perhaps this book makes that reality hard to argue.

I can remember fist glancing through it amazed at the number of women this man has amassed throughout the decade. Even more so to my amazement was the fact he was able to get all of his women to unclad themselves for his photo-lens. Not an easy task for a novice. At any rate, a great collage of his triumphs and tribulations in the young age of the seventies, how love has effected his art, the times, and women in general. I was sold on the story. I believed it till the last page. Like most romantic mythologies, the story is too good to want to know the truth, or care that another truth exists. Its art, but with a story. That is what I was sold on. Granted looking at naked pictures of women for ten minutes has its own thrill, but what the artist &quot;did&quot; to get these pictures in an eventual scrapbook of his life is wonderful. The book is perfect by itself in purporting all of these erotic adventures did actually occur, and the feelings and thoughts as the years went on with the male attachment to the woman figure seem vivid enough to give us our own recall of lovely women we have shared intimate moments with in the past. Its a tribute to the past. Its a tribute to women.

A semi-autobiographical look into the world of David Cronenberg and how he came to make films of grotsque, yet, captivating life of media, biology and society. You will read about his influences in his early childhood life and then, eventually, virtually being the only Canadian film director with a promise. Cronenberg seems humble in his writing, yet, you get a sense of high intelligence. Definately reccomended! It is a good read, moves along nicely and you will be quite fascinated by his personal accounts of his world and what inspires him.

The first Paranormal Activity was great, even after a long line of first person style of shooting. Blaire Witch set the standards and a few other competent films have followed. Paranormal the First created a new precedent of special effects, seemingly before your eyes. Whether its all post-edit computer effects can be argued, but the result is effective.The second installment seemed to rest on the hype alone and had no real follow-up from the first. I am not even sure if was the same house. Which dulls any later attempts because now the idea of what became Paranormal is not just random acts of ghostly stuff. One can get the same benefit from Discover Channel's "A Haunting".With the third installment, again, its another family. No history of anything is recalled or brought into play. This film has a larger family. A husband, wife and two daughters. Why these hauntings occur does not ever surface. The husband notices things and so this justifies him placing cameras in the house. The mother refuses to view any of it, so naturally she never spots anything. Throughout, her daughter talks to a Toby, which she believes is her daughters imaginary friend and says its a passing phase for a few weeks. We learn that Toby is the evil spirit behind all the happenings.Thats really the essence of the story. From that we are treated with some scary and creepy moments of ghostly raptures, telekinetic activity, other such nuisances. I believe some back story would create a deeper and emotional scare rather than just shock scares. My problem with handheld camera movies is that, almost under no circumstances to do these people relieve themselves of the camera for something as dire as surviving or protecting their loved ones. Towards the end, we see the mother in a situation, and the husband, while asking if she is ok, continues to hold the camera. We know she is in trouble, and he is not exactly in a safe spot either. I say "drop the camera!!" I know it's all for effect, but the realism is removed in those instances. This is not the only film that does that, but I still get pulled out of the movie or lose sympathy for the people.Paranormal still has scary and creepy moments that will sure make it a worthwhile viewing. And I say it is worth seeing. For all intents and purposes it is a well done film that is probably just as scary as the previous bunch.
