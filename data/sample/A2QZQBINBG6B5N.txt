First, let me say that I bought this book because I was frustrated with the Bible dictionaries I own when it comes to finding information on ancient rulers who are not directly mentioned in the Bible. They do a good job, as one would expect, of putting forth as much as can be known about kings, queens, and the queen mothers of Israel and Judah, but are weak in giving a good overview of the neighboring kingdoms and the genealogy of their rulers.This WHO'S WHO is written by a scholar who acknowledges that as an Assyriologist she has favored the history of Mesopotamia over other parts of the Ancient Near East. (The few entries there are on Egypt seem to be from the latter part of the first millennium. Routledge must want us to buy their WHO'S WHO IN ANCIENT EGYPT.) Entries are brief (the longest is three columns); most seem to be drawn from one or two sources, the CAMBRIDGE ANCIENT HISTORY being the dominant English language source. Leick chose not to provide translations of the names, probably because the etymology of too many of them remains uncertain. She does not reveal the basis for her English spellings which I would like to have known in case I need to do further exploring; but I assume she follows what's used in the CAH.Where my trust in the author's expertise breaks down is with the biblical persons she writes about. After acknowledging that the only source for David's biography is the Bible, she writes &quot;Saul's hostility never ceased, but his son Abner made overtures to David by marrying his sister Micah to him.&quot; Apart from the pronominal confusion of that sentence (I had to read it three times), there are some factual errors. According to the biblical record, Abner was Saul's cousin, not his son (1 Sam 14:50), and Saul's daughter who was given to David in marriage was named Michal (I've never encountered a different spelling). Leick goes on to say that David captured Jerusalem from the Canaanites (technically not wrong, but &quot;from a Canaanite people called the Jebusites&quot; would have been more precise and would have kept uninformed readers from assuming that the Canaanites existed as a unified nation); and describes Ammon, Moab, and Edom as Israel's &quot;western&quot; neighbors (all are east of the Jordan/Dead Sea). It should also probably be noted that precise biblical citations are rare in this book.Things I would like to see changed or added in a revised edition of this book: (1) include more detail in the Chronology; (2) add dynasty or succession charts for important kingdoms; and (3) reorient the maps (if they were turned sideways they could be larger and easier to read). And why are the maps in the front of the book and the Chronology in the back? They should be together in an appendix at the back of the book, after the glossary.

At long last on DVD! And nicely done, too! Finally I can discard my taped-from-PBS-with-tons-of-fundraising-blather VHS tapes. DVD extras include biographies and filmographies of the series' many stars (including one for Sebastian's teddy bear Alyosius), a production history (text, not a making-of featurette), a nicely prepared companion booklet, a photo gallery of the Castle Howard where much of the filming took place, and a tongue-in-cheek interview with the director about how success went to Alyosius's head. [One minor gripe is that the on-screen text is very difficult to read, which is too bad because there is quite a bit of good information presented in this manner.]But, make no mistake, the real reason to buy this DVD is that it is probably the best television program ever. The book, the filming, the acting, the ability of the story to make us question the way we choose to live and treat our fellow human beings is truly exceptional. It holds up perfectly. Brideshead is great art and does Waugh proud.

I remembered loving this &quot;small&quot; film when I saw it in the theater, so I knew I'd be happy with the DVD, whether it had any extras or not (it doesn't). Although Julianne Moore has made it big since making Uncle Vanya (&quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; &quot;Nine Months,&quot; &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;), and her lovely face dominates the DVD cover, &quot;Uncle Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; is truly ensemble acting at its best. Wallace Shawn as the title character does a powerful job of holding the viewer's interest, even though his Vanya is riddled with smugness, envy, self-pity, and lethargy. There are things about his performance that make you wonder if Louis Malle wasn't thinking of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; as a sequel to &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (especially since Andre Gregory plays the director who has gathered his troupe of actors to rehearse Uncle Vanya in the falling down New Amsterdam Theater in New York City). In both movies, Shawn plays a man facing a mid-life crises, plagued with self-doubt and floundering around, looking for reasons to go on.What struck me on my recent viewing of the film was how timeless Checkhov's story really is. Like Jane Austen, he has a great ability to find the universal in the pettiness of highly-controlled domestic life. In comparing Mamet's rendering with Paul Schmidt's excellent recent translation, it seems Mamet did a good job of crafting speakable lines. He modernized the play without wrenching it from its original time or setting. Since the performance we see is a final run-through, not a dress rehearsal, we receive no visual clues as to when the play within the movie actually begins. Malle's light hand in this regard only reinforces the dubiousness of the distinction between theater/art and reality (a much discussed subject in &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;).The decision to film &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in the decaying New Amsterdam Theater was an inspired one. When Dr. Astrov (Larry Pine), the play's most forward-looking character, bemoans the cultural and spiritual devastation caused by deforestation and human indifference to the environment, one can't help but think of the plight of 42nd Street itself. The New Amsterdam's resurrection--thanks to Disney dollars--as the current home of &quot;The Lion King&quot; is not without it's ironies. As all of the characters in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; are painfully aware, our futures are always purchased at a very high price. And the losses we are likely to experience as we move towards those futures may be greater than any of us will be able to bear.&quot;Uncle Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; is one of those great works of art, like Eugene O'Neill's &quot;A Long Day's Journey into Night,&quot; that makes you stop and take stock of your life.

Perhaps, like me, you have held on to the Complete Works of William Shakespeare you've had since college and are wondering if the world really needs yet another edition of the Bard's complete output. Well, the Modern Library edition of the Royal Shakespeare Company's Shakespeare has a lot to recommend it. The text is beautifully set in single column format, making it easier for actors and those who wish to read the text aloud to scan the poetic lines and to distinguish between poetry and prose. Jonathan Bates's General Introduction is comprehensive, engaging, and lively. As with the introductions to the individual plays, Bates gives special attention to the performance traditions from which these plays emerged as well as those which would shape their interpretation over the centuries. This concern for performance issues is also addressed in the "Key Facts" boxes that follow every play introduction. Here the editors summarize the plot, identify the major parts (with percentage of lines and number of speeches assigned to each character, etc.), take a stab at identifying a dates of composition and first performance, and discuss the plays' sources and state of the texts available. There are ample, but not an overwhelming number of footnotes. And these notes, Bates assures us, do not shy away from discussion of Shakespeare's bawdier puns (something that may not be true of your old college textbook). Another real plus is the inclusion of a fragmentary scene from "Sir Thomas More" based on the only manuscript known to be in Shakespeare's own hand.But the best reason to buy the RSC Shakespeare is because the editors have gone to great lengths to preserve the First Folio (1623) edition of Shakespeare. They have modernized the spelling and punctuation and have read (and corrected) the text against Quarto texts where these exist, but have not recklessly blended Quarto and Folio texts, something most previous editors have done with impunity for generations. The editors make a strong case for the Folio texts being the best versions available and respecting their "purity" makes it possible for readers and those preparing new stagings to grapple with textual variants in a thoughtful and respectful manner. It seems that Shakespearean textual critical work is finally taking on the discipline of biblical criticism. Let's hope the results will be equally illuminating and revolutionary.

This film is a fictional version of the beginnings of a group of real-life British traitors. As such, it speculates on the psychological motives of one privileged, public school educated man (played brilliantly by Rupert Everett). As a homosexual who was unwilling to pretend to be anything else, and as a student whose roommate happens to be a well-read Marxist, Everett's character, Guy, makes an easy leap to communism. This seems facile to me and an insult to both Marxists and homosexuals, but it's a trope I can accept for the sake of getting on with the story. (As the story progressed, I felt less concerned about whether the real-life spies were being fairly portrayed and just enjoyed the story as a piece of narrative fiction.)What I found most engaging and compelling about this film was its depiction of an elite and closed circle of society that most people never get to enter, but which is certainly emblematic of the way the larger world operates. Younger boys are exploited, older boys vie to be house masters and "gods" entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats. Rules are made to be bent and broken. Secrecy rules and the students hold council and administer discipline without ever seeming to consult the "real" authorities. And their fathers who sent them to this school, came up through the exact same system, and sent their sons there anyway. A colonial empire, it seems, is fueled by silence and sadism.The movie made me think of C.S. Lewis's memoire, SURPRISED BY JOY, in which he describes his own public school education. Although he was quite discreet, his depiction of the what boys in that situation go through was equally harrowing.Although most of the DVD extras are interesting, I found the audio commentary by the director and DP a little too focused on lighting and camera angles (i.e., dull!). But the transfer to DVD is excellent and the DP certainly deserves to be proud of his work.

I picked up Johnson's book on Don Quixote because the novel is large and intimidating to me and I felt I'd need some preparation before reading it. I also felt I needed something to undo the prejudices I had formed against the main character from seeing The Man of La Mancha. Johnson provides an excellent orientation to the many things going on in the novel. His scholarship is current and insightful; the extended discussion in the chapters "A Book about Books" and "Readers and Reading" were especially helpful. I also liked his explanations about how Parts I and II relate to one another (part II is clearly more than just a sequel or "more adventures"). Johnson concludes his study by revealing his own personal reading of the text. I found it plausible (it's mostly a psychological reading), but Johnson by no means suggests that his reading is conclusive or better than any other reader's reading. This is a book I plan to keep at hand as I begin (once again) to try to make it all the way through Cervantes' classic and ground-breaking novel.

Carefully researched and responsibly adapted for the screen, this film is based primarily on Richard Ellman's highly regarded 1988 biography "Oscar Wilde." (Ellman's book is out of print, but still relatively easy to find). The film essentially covers the latter part of the great Irish writer's life--his fall from grace when he is publicly challenged by the Marquess of Queensberry for having sexual relations with the Marquess's son, Lord Alfred Douglas (called "Bosie"). This is much the same turf covered by the exceptional play by Moises Kaufman, "Gross Indecency" (the script of this play is still in print). Unlike the play which consists almost entirely of trial transcripts, press coverage, and the writings of Wilde and others involved in the case, the film only turns to primary sources when needed. The filmmakers are less concerned with the legal tedium (three separate trials have been collapsed into what appears to be one), the larger issues of the decline of the British Empire, and the unraveling of Victorian morality in the face of modernity. Their primary interest seems to be the exploration of Wilde's psychology and the hold Douglas had on him. Careful to avoid the anachronistic use of terms like "homosexual" and "bisexual", Wilde is depicted as deeply fond of his wife Constance and their sons while being mesmerized by Douglas and the gay underworld of brothels and rentboys that they explore together. If the filmmakers are guilty of anything, it may be for depicting Wilde with too much sympathy. Wilde seems at times to be a saintly victim. Certainly he was more responsible for the consequences of his actions than the filmmakers suggest.This film, it should be said, is perfectly cast. Stephen Fry is as physically as close to Wilde as any casting director is likely to find; Jude Law's flawless beauty is put to good use in the role of Bosie; and Tom Wilkinson is a volatile and scary Marquess of Queensberry. The supporting actors are equally superb. The filmmakers make an odd choice to use Wilde's fairy tale "The Selfish Giant" as a recurring theme throughout the story, perhaps to emphasize Wilde's physical size, or to show that he was a loving and caring father who easily spun out fairy tales to entertain his sons. In these senses it works. But it seems to inflate the importance of that minor work within Wilde's corpus. "Lady Windermere's Fan," "The Picture of Dorian Gray," "The Importance of Being Ernest," and "Salome" are only mentioned in passing. And Wilde's great prison work, "De Profundis," (150 pages in the Viking Portable Library edition) is cavalierly referred to as "a letter to Bosie."The DVD extras are wonderful: two lengthy featurettes and audio commentary by the producer, director, screenwriter, and Fry. Although the commentators were fairly courteous to one another, it's probably impossible to do an intelligible commentary track with more than three persons.

Publishing is a notoriously conservative, unprofitable, non-linear line of business. The most fascinating parts of Epstein's book are his accounts of how he did something a little differently (&quot;thought outside the box,&quot; to use a current cliche) and helped create something truly innovative and worthwhile--like quality paperbacks (Anchor Books) and the Library of America (uniform editions of carefully edited American classics on acid-free paper). While this book is essentially an extended essay on where publishing is going (as publishing houses become lesser components in larger media companies, and author advances for the turner-outers of blockbuster titles sap publishers of their resources and makes them unwilling to take risks on more significant literary voices), there are some interesting portraits of key figures from publishing's past, such as Horace Liveright, Bennett Cerf, and Donald Klopfer.His key thesis, that the future of publishing lay in being able to obtain printed books on demand from ATM-like kiosks, is both hopeful and scary. It means that there will be no need for any title to ever go out of print, no matter how limited its audience. (Hopeful.) But will books produced in this manner be as satisfying to read, hold, and collect as any single title in the Library of America? (Scary.)

A great film, nicely transferred to widescreen. Which is crucial for this film because it cleverly takes advantage of split screen cinematography to underscore the relational and psychic splits of its two main characters--interior decorator, Jan Morrow (Day) and playboy/cad songwriter, Brad Allen (Hudson).Although I always love watching Doris Day movies (her voice, the brassiness of her hair, her wardrobe), Pillow Talk is one of the better written ones. The dialog is clever, especially the verbal sparring between the two stars as they vie for time on their shared party-line (though I wonder if anyone under 40 even knows what a party line is). The storyline is simple (Day's films never seem to have many subplots) and it's easy to see why feminists in the 70s dismissed Day's screen image as concessionary and why feminists of later decades gleefully embraced her sparkle and spunk. Adding to the fun is the gender-bending done with Hudson's character, who, as a playboy on the make pretends to be gay in order to inspire his female victim to take more [love] initiative. The fact that Hudson (the actor) was himself gay, only adds to the dramatic irony.Thelma Ritter, Morrow's alcoholic cleaning lady, and Tony Randall, one of Morrow's rich clients (and one who happens to be in love with her), turn in wonderful vaudvillian performances.Although the DVD has no extras, it's great to have this film in widescreen format...and at a reasonable price.

I bought this DVD after watching GODS AND MONSTERS, the fictionalized account of the last days of James Whale, the British director who made both the original FRANKENSTEIN (1931)and this superior sequel. According to the film historian Scott MacQueen who provides the feature commentary, Karloff disagreed with the director's decision to give the monster dialogue (he only growls and moans in the earlier film). But Karloff did an excellent job of delivering his verbless sentences and conveying the sense of pathos that surely embodies Whale's feelings as an outsider who never quite fit in (as a homosexual, as a Brit in America, as a creative artist working for one of Hollywood's lesser studios). In fact, it is the monolithic, unthinking townspeople who turn out to be the most frightening and monstrous thing in this movie.The picture and sound on this DVD are excellent. Besides the insightful feature commentary mentioned above there is an interesting original documentary (the discussion of the censorship codes and how Whale managed to dodge them was especially fascinating). If you have only seen the movie on t.v., you've probably missed out on the prologue--a scene in which Elsa Lanchester plays Mary Shelley defending her creation against Lord Byron's supercilious taunts. If you loved GODS AND MONSTERS like I did, you'll want to at least rent this DVD. Only the truly obsessive, however, will want to bother with the original FRANKENSTEIN.

A theory so plausible and eloquently argued that you want to give yourself a V-8 forehead slap. Freedman looks at the Ten Commandments (yes, he addresses ALL ten of them) in relationship to the Primary History in the Bible (the nine books from Genesis through Kings, minus Ruth). Along the way he disburses some very interesting information that will enhance Bible readers' future experience with the Bible texts: he explains the practice of &quot;the pairing of texts&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, makes compelling points about Jeremiah's relationship to the Primary History, contrasts monotheism with henotheism and monolatry, and gives a fascinating explanation of how the Hebrew divining stones, the Urim and Thummim, probably worked.I've always felt Bible readers have made the mistake of elevating the Torah/Pentateuch at the expense of the rest of the Old Testament. Freedman's thesis seems to defend the integrity of the Hebrew Scriptures as a whole. He shows how the Israelites broke each of the Commandments they received in the wilderness. Not only broke them, but with minimal adjustments to sequencing, Freedman shows that they broke them in order. This breaking of the Commandments constitutes a &quot;scarlet thread&quot; that runs through the Primary History and that ultimately explains why the Israelites suffered defeat and exile at the hands of God's enemies. But there are ten commandments and only nine books in the Primary History. Which commandment does not get represented by a specfic sinful act in a book of its own is a mystery Freedman does not answer until the last chapter. The suspense makes this highly accessible scholarly work, a bit of a page-turner.If you read this book and enjoy it, you might also like the equally fascinating but more ambitious &quot;Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds,&quot; by Donald Harman Akenson.

The thing I remember most about this film when I saw it in the theater in 1990 was its honesty. On every level. Great care was taken to accurately depict one particular community at one particular time--when AIDS was first being diagnosed as "the gay cancer," up through the mid-eighties, when attending monthly funerals was commonplace for gay men and their friends. Though HIV/AIDS had been around for a decade when this movie was made, there was no effort on the part of the filmmakers to whitewash the past. They not only show the ugliness of the disease, they show the ugliness of people's response to it. Even within the gay community there was a tendency for people to fingerpoint, accusing the first victims of being more promiscuous than themselves, or more excessive users of amyl nitrate and recreational drugs. There was fear of contamination, reluctance to touch or kiss, and even intimacy within monogomous relationships was hampered. People reached deperately for New Age cures, and Louise Haye was the reigning goddess of self-healing. By choosing to depict a five-year period, the filmmakers allow the viewer to see the lives of a group of friends evolve and deepen. Some of course succumb to the disease and die, others wrestle with their losses and rethink their lives. In the end, the survivors try to become part of the solution; they become visiting volunteers and political activists. For all its authenticity, the film is not depressing. This is incredible ensemble acting at its best. Campbell Scott, Bruce Davison, and Mark Lamos give especially moving performances, but there are no slackers in this cast.By the time the movie was released, the face of AIDS was already changing and the filmmakers were criticized for focusing exclusively on gay victims. I felt then, and I continue to believe, this is a misplaced criticism. All fiction is self-limited. LONGTIME COMPANION is the story of one small group of friends who are affected by an unknown and dreadful disease; and it shows how each of them responds to the challenges thrown at them. Yes, they were wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together on Fire Island. But LONGTIME COMPANION is not a celebration of their insular lives. In fact, by the end of the film, one of this insular group, Campbell Scott's character, is shown working as a home care volunteer who visits a Latino man. I think the filmmakers, like GMHC at the time, were aware that things were starting to change. It seems to me that the film's critics, even in 1990, had forgotten that AIDS was first announced in the New York Times as "gay cancer" and later as "Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome" before being called AIDS. But that said, we need to remember that there are many other people's stories that are worth telling, including those of people living and coping with AIDS in Africa. My only hope is that these stories will be told with all the accuracy and sensitivity that went into the making of LONGTIME COMPANION.The DVD has no significant "extras," but the transfer is excellent.

I re-read this novel that I remembered enjoying when I read it in high school because a quote from it ("roses were the only flower she could bear to see cut") was pivotal in Gregoire Bouillier's fascinating short memoir THE MYSTERY GUEST. Bouillier's debt to Woolf is broader and deeper than just a stolen phrase. Both books center around the anticipation of a party in contrast with the reality of its experience as it unfolds; and both share themes of the cruelty and triviality of human nature. Compared to other stream of conscious masterpieces (Joyce's ULYSSES or Faulkner's THE SOUND AND THE FURY), Dalloway is relatively easy to follow. I found it's structure and execution to be rather cinematice. The story is bookended with sections focusing on the title character. In the large middle section the narrative passes seamlessly from one secondary character to another like a baton in a (leisurely) relay race. The trick is to anticipate that the baton will be passed and that the point of view and pronominal references are going to shift. I put an "x" in the margin each time I observed the baton being passed (these would probably be chapter breaks in more conventional novels). I found this to be helpful when I needed to reread a section to refresh my memory on a detail. What is amazing is that Woolfe employs an objective third person narration throughout, and yet each section strongly projects the obsessions and interests of the character that has been brought into the foreground. The prose is fluid, beautiful, and free of gimmickry. The author, like Clarissa Dalloway, is in complete control of all she surveys, a master manipulator. In the end, this seems to me to be a novel about accepting (or resisting) at middle age the compromises one has made in life. And "the ladies," indeed, "come and go, speaking of Michelangelo."

I listened to this audiobook on a long road trip recently and found it held my attention from beginning to end. First, Spacek is an excellent reader who has a unique way of giving every character a unique voice--both sexes, and all ages, races, and social classes. She even manages to project the feistiness and naivte of the young narrator ("Scout" Finch, who is about 7 years old through most of the novel) without being as annoying as the character most likely was to the adults she interacted with. Spacek's warmth and sensitive reading were essential in communicating that MOCKINGBIRD is a novel about how a community understands itself: the silences it keeps and the things it will and won't tolerate. Although I read the book many years ago and enjoyed it then, what struck me as especially interesting upon hearing it anew is that Harper Lee has done something very unique, she has presented us with a dual coming-of-age story. At the same time that Scout is facing some hard realities as she reaches what theologicans used to call "the age of reason," her brother Jim is moving from childhood to adolescence (at one point he proudly displays a single chest hair), a time of troubling ambiguity. This dual perspective of reason and sexuality proves to be the perfect lens through which to observe the key events of the story, the ugliness of racism and the trumped-up charges of rape that Atticus Finch, the children's father, is called to address in his role as court-appointed lawyer for an accused black man. At times the novel veers toward preachy, and I'm sure some readers/listeners will find it heavy-handed. But somehow, perhaps because it is told to us by a child, this heavy-handedness seems easy to forgive.

This volume of stories about Wyoming contains four fully developed, character-driven short stories interspersed with what feels like seven thinly disguised local anecdotes. Yet in both kinds of stories Proulx demonstrates a Faulkner-like skill at portraying agrarian locals coming head-to-head with modernity. The final (anecdotal) story, "Florida Rental", especially reminded me of Faulkner's "Spotted Horses" sequence from The Snopes Trilogy. And like Faulkner, Proulx seems to have an underlying affection (or at least respect) for all her characters, even the ones she seems to enjoy skewering.The substantial stories that I enjoyed are: "The Indian Wars Refaught" about a troubled young Sioux woman who reconnects with her sense of identity while sorting archival material related to the battle of Wounded Knee; "What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?," about one Wyoming rancher's decline in the face of changing times, a failed marriage, and sons who've gone their own ways; "Man Crawling Out of Trees" about an elderly couple who moved to Wyoming from the East and how each of them responds in radically different ways to the rugged terrain, taciturn populace, and sense of isolation; "The Wamsutter Wolf" in which the human characters are eerily shown to behave according to wolf pack mores. Of all the stories, these four come closest to matching the standard Proulx set for herself with "Brokeback Mountain." Also worth mentioning here is "Dump Junk," a story that interestingly moves beyond Proulx's very grounded sense of reality into the realm of fantasy.All in all, this is a pretty satisfying collection of stories.

John Sayles and this movie are too good to deserve the minimalist treatment Warners gave them when they put this DVD together. There is virtually NOTHING extra--no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes featurette, no cast and crew biographies (Sayles uses an amazing cast, each of which I wanted to know more about). Ironically, considering the importance of multiculturalism as a theme of the movie, there isn't even a Spanish audio track. And when will the studios learn that theatrical trailers are NOT value-added features?I'm glad to own the film (though there was a funny blip in the middle of it)...but I think Warners could have given us more. And more importantly, John Sayles deserves better.

The pieces gathered in this collection of humorist David Sedaris's writings are all interesting, insightful (into the human condition), and funny. But behind the humor, I suspect, is a deep well of pain. Sedaris is a gay author who writes about things other than being gay; and when he writes of his own homosexuality, it is always without any fanfare. In fact, the unifying theme of these stories seems to be the pain of being "odd" or an outsider. In some cases, Sedaris's outsider status can be clearly linked to his being gay (as in the opening story, "Go Carolina," which describes the ordeal of being one of several sensitive boys in his school who is singled out for speech therapy for their lisps and effeminate speaking patterns). Elsewhere, his outsider status is due to being a northerner who moved to North Carolina, or an American who spends summers in France. On top of this, just being a member of his family seems to automatically qualify him for instant alien and mutant status. In fact, because of this many of his stories reminded me of souped up (some may say "vulgarized") versions of James Thurber's classic stories of his eccentric Ohio relatives. In fact, one story about his struggle to give up drinking, "The Late Show," reminded me of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty." As Sedaris struggles to make it through painful nights of insomnia he fashions a variety of outlandish identities for himself. While exagerated humor is a constant in Sedaris's stories, there is always something else present just below the surface that almost anyone can identify with. In flaunting his eccentricities and outsider status, Sedaris has presented himself as a universal type, a true everyman.

After being passed over for the role of Eliza Doolittle for the film version of MY FAIR LADY (the role she created on Broadway) for the more "loverly" but less vocally-skilled Audrey Hepburn, Andrews was recruited for Mary Poppins personally by Walt Disney who offered the role to her on the spot after seeing her in CAMELOT. Once given a chance to prove her screen presence she managed to turn in a number of very memorable and diverse film roles, though she is mostly remembered for her two singing nanny roles, Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp.The 40th Anniversary DVD set of MARY POPPINS s chock full of interesting extras--interviews with Andrews and VanDyke, making-of featurettes, a game, etc. I found the black and white archival footage of the Hollywood Premier to be especially fascinating. Although there is nothing critical of the movie, the Disney studios, or Disney the man in these extras--and you do feel a bit manipulated into a sense of awe--MARY POPPINS was a great achievement that took Disney many years to pull off. You can't really begrudge the man his bragging rights. (In the trivia track of the movie, the studio is quick to assert that if the initial box-office take were recalculated based on current ticket prices, MP would be the top grossing film of all time, out-performing THE LORD OF THE RINGS, etc.).The DVD extras also helped me to understand things about the movie that have always bothered me. The music, though catchy in its own way, is consciously composed based on elements of the British music hall which I think accounts for their slightly cold, alien quality (As an American unconsciously influenced by African-American and jazz idioms, I think my ear naturally craves minor chords and more complex rhythms). Also, the featurettes reveal that the books the movie was based on were really a collection of amusing stories rather than novels with beginnings, middles and ends. It was the Disney writers who consequently had to provide the overarching story line. And in bizarre and typical Disney fashion (who in their 50s today was not traumatized by the death of Bambi's mother? or Dumbo's separation from Jumbo?), it pivots on child abandonment issues. I remember seeing MP 40 years ago and being very upset by how blithely Mary floated out of the children's lives after having worked her magic--no promise to send post cards, visit once a year on their birthdays, or attend their graduations. True, she functioned as a catalyst in the life of the children's family and was responsible for turning the neglectful, business-obsessed father and women's-suffrage-obsessed mother into caring and attentive parents, but that does little to offset the bittersweet sadness of seeing Mary lift off and float out of the young children's lives forever. I remember thinking at the time, "She was just pretending to like the kids all along. Looking after them was just a job for her. How cold!"The true achievement of MARY POPPINS, however, was the way Disney combined animation with live action, something we probably take for granted today. Perhaps because it was harder to do this "back then", such sequences were well thought out in MP and never seem gratuitous. To those people who don't like to be shown "how it's done" and want to preserve the mystery, I would say, just ignore the "extras" disk. But I found the "how to" stuff fascinating--especially Ed Wynn's laughing tea party scene and the phenominal chimney sweepers rooftop dance number.The Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is worth the purchase price. You'll find yourself watching the movie AND the extras disk many times over.

I am a big fan of architecture critic Witold Rybczynski. If you haven't read his books HOME, or WAITING FOR THE WEEKEND, or CITY LIFE, this book is a good way to get familiar with many of the themes he has addressed time and again over his long and prolific career (e.g., the place of houses in people's lives, living smaller, the role of architects, the legacy of modernism, the place and meaning of ornament, the intrusion of fashion into the world of architecture, and the importance of the Vitruvian values of commodity, firmness and beauty in identifying "good" architecture). Many of these pieces were previously published in magazines and journals. Some are more thoughtful, well-researched, and even polemical; others read like Sunday magazine fluff pieces (not too many of these, though). Like many of Rybczynski's books, there are no illustrations. If you're like me, you'll find youself going to the Internet often to get images of some of the buildings, places, and people he mentions. It slows down the reading, but is necessary, it seems, to get the full impact of what Rybczynski is saying.

You either love the movie or you don't. If you're a VoD lover, the Special Edition 2-disk release is worth every cent. The film is beautifully restored to its "Color by De Luxe" and Panavision widescreen glory. (My VHS tape is on a barge making its way to the Staten Island landfill as I type this). The second disk includes karioke renderings of songs along with several documentaries and featurettes (all listed above). My favorite of these is "Jacqueline Susann and Valley of the Dolls," which has generous film clips depicting the chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking for herself and coming across as, more than anything, a highly committed and indefatigable professional writer (who used a different color of typing paper for each of her six drafts of the manuscript). It's easy to see how this no-nonsense, get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin the procratinating perfectionist and celebrity syncophant Truman Capote. (I was surprised to see no mention of their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among the DVD extras.)The missed opportunity among all the extras was the commentary track on Disk One. It was great to have Barbara Parkins (although her memories seem to have grown rather dim over the years). One would have liked to hear from Patty Duke (or even Leigh Grant) as well, though we can only guess why Fox wasn't able to make that happen. But the commentary could have been greatly enriched if Fox had nixed the use of gossip columnist Ted Cassablanca (who stole his nom de plume from a gay character in the novel) and engaged a truly informed movie critic or film historian to co-comment with Ms Parkins. Casablanca badgers Parkins for "dish" on the other actresses, Sharon Tate's murder, Judy Garland's walking out on the Helen Lawson role; and when he's not badgering, he cooing about her perfume or comparing notes with her on which actors in the film they each found "do-able." (Parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes and thought of singer Cat Stevens in England.) Both Parkins and Casablanca are surprisingly ignorant of basic facts about the film. I found myself frequently shouting at the TV screen, "Watch Disk Two--it's all explained there!"Among the things I still don't understand: Why do so many people dimiss or discount Hayward's performance as the Merman-inspired Helen Lawson? Hayward comes solidly out of "the women's picture" tradition and seems to be perfectly cast. Her singing voice, supplied by veteran big-band singer Margaret Whiting (that's Mrs. Jack Wrangler to you, Ted Casablanca), was a perfect match (raw with years of backstage smoking). But, the only explanation I can come up with is that Ms Garland's fans so much wanted to see her in another singing role they shun Hayward's performance out of perverse loyalty to Garland. (Garland died two years after the release of VoD, perhaps adding a degree of fierceness to her fans' loyalty.)The Special Edition DVD overemphasizes the camp and cult elements of the movie (the "bouncing ball" in the karioke rendering of Lawson's "I'll Plant My Own Tree" is really a red wig that ends up in a cartoon toilet on the final sustained note of the song). Such thing make for fun viewing ONCE. But the movie, the movie is a delicious treat that lasts forever.

This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively. The title refers to the reel of gay and homoerotic scenes from Hudson's studio films that he compiled for showing to his friends at parties. There are no candid home movie clips (no shots of Rock by the pool, Rock and Tab Hunter playing croquet, or of anyone dressed in women's clothes). If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen). On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson). I'm sure for some viewers these qualities will give the film a sort of underground cult classic feeling and add to its appeal. I found such effects distracting and annoying. On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld). All stones were left unturned.Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day). Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.

A nice short (115 text pages!) history of Evangelicalism in America, from the First Great Awakening to the present day. Barnard professor Balmer gives an historian's perspective on different aspects of the Evangelical movement in our national life without placing undue emphasis on the personalities behind the scenes. At the heart of his discussion is the exploration of several key ironies. First, he marvels at the fact that Americans take their religion so seriously (compared to people from other industrialized societies). It is ironic that it is in the United States, with its Constitutional imperative to keep church and state separate, that religious expression is so vibrant, various, and abiding. He attributes the freedom of religion (and the absence of direct governmental support though taxation) as being key to the ability of native-born religions to prosper and grow exponentially. He also finds it ironic that the Fundamentalists who decry scientific modernism in every form have so willingly embraced the new technologies: radio, technology, and the Internet. Another irony he looks at is the current-day Evangelical rejection of feminism. Women are sidelined within Evangelicalism and assigned the sentimentalized role of guardians of morality. This is ironic in light of the important leadership roles women held in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century church-based reform movements.This book is more handy than it is comprehensive (the endnotes direct the reader to some promising articles and books, but Balmer does not provide even a short bibliography). This book probably won't be very satisfying to serious students of American religion looking for a good introduction to the subject; but the average reader who is curious about religion and public life will find it informative. Don't skip the last chapter, "Vocabulary of Evangelicalism", in which Balmer defines the Evangelical subcategories: Fundamentalism, the Holiness Movement, Pentecostalism, and the Charismatic Movement.

In this brilliant little satirical novel, Evelyn Waugh takes on Hollywood, the British expatriate community in Los Angeles, the death care industry, romantic love, filial love, sexism (perhaps without knowing it), and American attitudes toward success, death, foreigners, art, their pets, suicide, morality, newspaper advice columns, and religion (both ancient and new-fangled). No tombstone goes unturned. Rather than summarize the plot, let me just say that the title of the book, which is an obvious reference to the standard funteral director's euphemism for a deceased person, actually takes on another meaning as well, especially as the two main male characters (Dennis Barlow, an British would-be poet newly arrived to Los Angeles, and Mr. Joyboy, a successful local embalmer) vie for the affections of the same young lady, Aimee Thanatogenos. The novel could be seen on one level as the story of her journey from being the men's love object (desired, but never really "seen") to becoming a "loved one" in the death care industry sense of the word.At the same time I was reading the book, I rented Tony Richardson's marvelous all-star film (1965). Both are equally wicked and satirical, but Richardson's film, in its exploitation of American anxieties about nuclear war, has more in common with Stanley Kubric's "Dr. Strangelove" than with Waugh's 1948 novel. In any case, seeing the movie didn't spoil the ending of the book. Both are brilliant and LOL fun.

Having enjoyed Hornby's more recent novels, HOW TO BE GOOD and A LONG WAY DOWN, I thought I'd start reading his earlier novels. Hornby has a gift for taking on big existential themes like despair and suicide and presenting them with a gentle but incisive humor that doesn't trivialize them. And he peoples his stories with a heterogenous mix of characters who seem determined to misunderstand one another but who eventually make their compromises with life without too much loss of dignity and who discover something greater than romantic love or sex--a deep sense of community, a profound and inclusive sense of rootedness in a shaky and transient world.ABOUT A BOY centers on the relationship between a young boy, Marcus, and an unattached, cool bachelor, Will, who has joined the boy's mother's support group SPAT (Single Parents-Alone Together) as a way to meet grateful but unclingy women. It is clear from the start that Hornby could have named this novel ABOUT TWO BOYS and the novel has much to say about what it means for boys and perennial bachelors to grow up. It has much to do with taking risks, opening oneself up to other people (even to those you want nothing from), honoring real losses, and taking life on life's terms. As the wise child Marcus observes, two is not enough. He believes in "human pyramids." "I feel better and safer than before," he tells his late-to-the-game real father, "I was really scared because I didn't think two was enough, and now there aren't two anymore. There are loads. And you're better off that way."A word to those who saw the movie: The book is really worth reading, so don't dismiss it if you didn't like the movie. Although I can't imagine anyone but Hugh Grant delivering Will's lines (and all of the casting was excellent), the book does NOT end with a corny middle-school talent show. Hornby uses another event to bring the story to a head and resolve its many little plot lines, one more germane to the themes of the book. All in all, a more thoughtful and satisfying ending.

This novel is one I would classify as a "tale" because it has the moral weight and simple elegance of one of Hawthorne's tales. There are few characters in this tale. And the two main characters seem to represent so much. These two characters are the narrator, Michael Berg, who begins his account with the story of how he lost his virginity at age 15 to a 36 year old streetcar conductor named Hanna Schmitz, and the streetcar conductor herself, whose life continues to interlace with Berg's. Their story spans a period of about thiry years, a period long enough for Michael to learn much about pride, guilt, shame, disappointment, and the ability of human beings to numbly accept just about any degree of indignity. At first I was taken aback by the affair between the schoolboy and the conductor (were the sexes reversed, I wondered whether most readers would have been either outraged or guiltily titilated). But, in the end, the narrator seems to come to a point where he has a perspective on how he had been exploited. Indeed, this experience of exploitation seems to parallel even greater forms of human exploitation and becomes key to understanding many of the other things that unfold in this tale. The way the story progresses is truly masterful and to describe the plot would deprive readers of their own first impressions. Schlink seems to have William Faulkner's gift to force readers to reconsider each character's merits chapter after chapter. If you can, stay away from any review that reveals too much about the storyline. Surrender to the experience of discovery and reflection.This brief novel seems grounded in major philosophical and theological issues--like the roles of conscience and the will. In fact, the stunning paragraph on pp. 19-20 about conscience ("Often enough in my life I have done things I had not decided to do.") seems to come right out of St. Paul ("I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do." Romans 7:18,19). The nature of evil and moral lassitude is at the very heart of this book. Another association: The narrator's description of his desire to achieve numbness on a skiing trip called to mind the conversation between the man and the woman about indifference in Marguerite Duras's screenplay for "Hiroshima Mon Amour" (ISBN 0802131042). This association may be especially apt considering that Renais's film involves painful recollections of the World War II experiences of a French woman who was ostracized for her love affair with a German soldier and of a Japanese man's experience of the Hiroshima bombing.The "tale-like" quality of the story also made me wonder if the reader wasn't being asked to make something of the main characters' names. "Berg" is somewhat ethnically ambiguous; "Michael" is the name of one of the militant angels; "Hanna" means "grace" and was the name of a pious Jew in the Hebrew Bible."The Reader" is a powerful story. It's one you'll want to read carefully...and more than once.

Believe it or not, it's hard to find a good commentary on the Book of Psalms. I screen for two things--books that are too &quot;spiritual&quot; and books that are too &quot;Christian&quot; (&quot;Christological,&quot; to be more precise). As far as spirituality goes, I feel fully cabable of having my own spiritual or devotional response to the Psalms. I don't need books to tell me how to feel. (One of the truly amazing things about the Psalms is that they evoke different responses every time one reads them.) Nor do I need books that explain away the uglier aspects of the psalms, such as the powerful vengeance motif found in Psalm 137:8,9 (&quot;Happy are those who pay you [Babylon] back for what you have done to us--who take your babies and smash them against a rock.&quot;) Similarly, while I enjoy hearing psalms read in church and understand that part of what Christians know and believe about Jesus Christ is based on the way the first Christians read and understood the Psalms, I do not have a compelling need to see every verse of every psalm as a one-way vector pointing to Christ.Sarna's book consists of a short introduction (20 pages) and commentary on a mere ten psalms (1, 8, 19, 15, 24, 30, 48, 82, 93, and 94). But as limited as this selection is, Sarna is able to introduce us to a good range of biblical themes and to equip us to continue our exploration of the Psalms on our own. Sarna is an excellent biblical scholar and the author of the Genesis and Exodus volumes in the Jewish Publication Society's Torah Commentary Series. He appreciates the psalms as ancient texts that share traits with other writings from the ancient Near East. Any intelligent, open-minded Jew or Christian looking for a way to deepen his or her own experience of reading the psalms need not fear that Sarna has an agenda to dismantle their faith and debunk everything they treasure. The grounding and context that Sarna provides will only enrich your psalm-reading experience.If you have never read the Psalms all the way through, start with this book. It's only 200 pages long (excluding endnotes), but it tells you everything you need to know to get started. Hopefully, one day Sarna will publish commentary on the other one hundred forty Psalms.

This book deserves all the praise it has received. It does something I've never been able to do when talking to friends: it articulates the value of reading and studying literature. You don't have to have read IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME to enjoy this book. In fact, de Botton could probably have subsituted Joyce, Faulkner, or Woolf for Proust and produced a similar study. The self-help format seems appropriate (even if sardonically intended). De Botton seems to be directly addressing (and at times challenging) the earnestness of people who turn to books to improve themselves (and who expect books to show them the best way to improve those around them). My favorite chapters were &quot;How to Suffer Successfully&quot; and &quot;How to Be a Good Friend.&quot; The final chapter, &quot;How to Put Down Books,&quot; should probably be photocopied and stapled to the door of every library and bookstore. I cautions us against bibliolatry.One tiny gripe. De Botton does not always identify the works he is quoting from. We don't need to know specific page numbers, but it would be nice to know if a quotation is from one of the volumes of IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, or from an essay or letter. In one case, I wasn't sure if the quote was Proust's or Ruskin's.

I first read A SEPARATE PEACE when I was fourteen or fifteen and was immediately drawn into the world and relationships of Devon, the fictional prep school where the story unfolds. I remember being startled and awakened because I had never read a novel where the main character (Gene Forrester) was someone who was as torn by self-doubt and envy as I knew myself to be. Although I first read the book during the Vietnam War and the events it describes took place during World War II, the book seemed to speak directly to my soul. So much so, that the first diary I ever kept was in the form of letters to Gene...because I was sure he was the only person who could understand what I felt. I reread the novel every few years and it never loses its power and honesty for me.For years I looked in used bookstores for a good hardcover edition to replace my tattered paperback. Thank you Scribners for including A SEPARATE PEACE in you Scribner Classics series of great, affordable hardcover modern classics. This is not a shoddily run off photo-reproduction of an earlier edition. It is a beautifully typeset (and carefully proofread) new setting. If you loved the book, you'll enjoy owning the hardcover edition.

Marius concludes his fine collection of essays on Faulkner by asserting, "In 1942 [Faulkner] could look back on sixteen years of the most productive greatness in American literary history." If you consider that four of the thirteen novels authored in this period -- THE SOUND AND THE FURY, AS I LAY DYING, LIGHT IN AUGUST, and ABSALOM! ABSALOM! -- would be on anyone's list of best 100 American novels of all time or best English-language novels of the 20th century, it is indeed an awesome accomplishment. If you consider the hardship Faulkner worked under during this period (always close to bankruptcy, doing degrading script work in Hollywood, enduring a bad marriage, surviving the deaths of a daughter and brother, and manifesting what was surely clinical alcoholism), the achievement is even more awesome.The sense of the greatness of Faulkner's mind pervades Marius's analyses of the texts. In spite of Faulkner's great experimentalism, Marius always assumes the author knew what he was doing and that Faulkner's ultimate choices (about point of view, character, narration, dialect, vocabulary choice) can be trusted as essential to the great storyteller's craft and intentions. The novels FLAGS IN THE DUST, THE WILD PALMS and GO DOWN, MOSES are good examples of times when editorial intervention did more harm than good. Marius also does a good job of sorting out the influences that are key to understanding and appreciating Faulkner: Darwin, Freud, Frazer, Eliot, Joyce, and Proust; and he gives teasing insights into the rivalry between Faulkner and Hemingway. (For instance, Hemingway often seems coy on sexual matters that wouldn't raise an eyebrow in mainstream fiction today; this is mostly because of the prudishness of his editor at Scribners', Max Perkins. Faulkner's freedom from such censorship stirred Hemingway's envy; Hemingway's runaway sales stirred Faulkner's.) In addition to the chapters on Faulkner's thirteen first novels, the book includes insightful essays on "Faulkner and Blacks: The Endemic Problem of Race and Racism in American Society" and "Faulkner an the Mythological World." Understood as class lectures, this book is best read from beginning to end, as much in the later chapters assumes the reader is familiar with concepts introduced earlier. Marius is clearly a gifted teacher--one who coaxes as well as instructs--and I would have loved to have sat in his class. I would also love to know what he thought of Faulkner's later work, the novels that most critics consider inferior but which to me still show sparks of greatness (and in some cases are as easy to read as Hemingway or any other bestselling author.)

McDonald and Sanders have done an excellent job of convoking the best and brightest to discuss issues around the formation and understanding of the biblical canon.(Their use of the word "debate" for the title may be a bit of an overstatement considering the respectful collegiality of the participants.) Every contributor is a highly credentialed major player in the field. The editors express disappointment that Bruce Metzger, Roger Beckwith, Earle Ellis, Brevard Childs, and Gerald Sheppard were unable for various reasons to contribute articles. While their thoughts would have been interesting, the 31 Jewish and Christian scholars who did contribute are not to be considered second string (many of whom quote and reference the five absent giants anyway).My enthusiasm for the thought contained in this 662-page book is based on having read the introduction and five randomly selected articles: "The Notion and Definition of Canon" (Eugene Ulrich), "Jamnia Revisited" (Jack P. Lewis), "The Old Testament Apocrypha in the Early Church and Today" (David J. Harrington, S.J.), "The Codex and Canon Consciousness" (Robert A. Kraft), and "The Problem of Pseudonymity in Biblical Literature and Its Implication" (Kent D. Clarke). As far as I can tell, these are new papers, not reworkings of existing materials. Harrington's thoughts on the Apocrypha, for instance, go far beyond anything he expressed on this subject in his own excellent book, INTVITATION TO THE APOCRYPHA (1999). Clarke's article on Pseudonymity answered a lot of questions I've had about this issue and I felt it did a good job of showing how a person's assumptions about a biblical book's pseudonymity (whether the practice is honorable, innocent, and licit or dishonorable, deceptive, and illicit) affects how a person is likely to judge that book's status within the canon. So far I've been impressed with everything I read. I look forward to savoring the remaining 26 articles.Editor McDonald provided four interesting appendices and the bibliography is worth the cost of the book (they seem to identify English translations of scholarly works created in other languages when possible, though I noticed they did not do so with Trobisch's FIRST EDITION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, Oxford, 2000; otherwise, the bibliography seems to be quite current).If you're at all curious about how the Bible came to be and why different religious traditions have different Bibles, THE CANON DEBATE will give you lots to mull over. Accessible, but challenging.

I bought this little book to help me understand some of the slang that bubbles through the British mini-series, "Queer as Folk." ("Snogging" is kissing; "Sod off" is the equivalent of "Get lost"; "Cor" is a mild exclamation, a shortened form of "God blind me.") Since not every British movie available on DVD is captioned for the deaf, you may want this little volume close at hand when you rent "Trainspotting," "Snatch," "The Full Monty," and other contemporary fast-talking comedies.Written in a very informal style(by a Brit who lived in Texas for two years) and peppered with cartoons, this volume is divided into seven little chapters: one on general slang and chapters on food and drink, clothing, motoring, people (a "punter" is a customer...or a better, as in the movie "Croupier"), household items, and odds and sods (miscellany). Treat yourself to a copy of this amusing book. Keep it by the telly, mute the commercials, and enjoy!

Several of Jean Arthur's comedies would make my list of top hundred films of all time: "Easy Living," "The Devil and Miss Jones," and "The More the Merrier." Other films she starred in, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," and "Shane," more frequently place high on Best Films lists. There's nothing John Oller says in JEAN ARTHUR: THE ACTRESS NOBODY KNEW that is likely to diminish the esteem and affection die-hard fans feel for this quirky and endearing star. In fact, discovering her love of reading and cats, her aversion to playing the Hollywood game, and her fierce protection of her own privacy, made me respect her all the more. She lived for several decades after making her last film ("Shane"). She made forays into television (her "Gunsmoke" episode can be downloaded for viewing); and her several efforts to perform on stage plays make for painful reading as her ambivalence and anxiety about these productions is palpable. Even co-workers who suffered the consequences of Arthur's leaving productions before the ends of their runs had mostly nice things to say about her. Oller addresses, but says nothing definitive about, Arthur's purported lesbian relationship with Mary Martin, a friendship that diminished after Martin's huge success in the televised production of "Peter Pan," a role Arthur had embodied on stage before Martin. In general, Oller does due dilligence as a researcher while steering clear of juicy (but dubious) anecdotes (though this is far from a sanitize biography). His assertions are backed up by trustworthy sources making it easy for the reader to relax and enjoy the story of Arthur's life.

Early on in this collection of enjoyable and highly engaging essays, Whitaker admits that he is laying before us the gay and lesbian authors he has been drawn to. This is a personal essay, not a Gay Lit 101 textbook. Consequently, some major gay American writers are not included: David Leavitt, Christopher Bram, Edmund White, Christopher Isherwood, Tennessee Williams, Carson McCullers, Truman Capote. Lesbian representation is slight--just Emily Dickinson (near queer, at that), Jane Bowles, and Gertrude Stein. And one slot was taken up by a writer who isn't even American (Oscar Wilde).What's nice about Whitaker's writing, though, is that it is disciplined and thoughtful. He allows us glimpses of himself (it is safe to assume that part of his disdain for Gore Vidal, the man, derives from Whitaker's own experiences as a prostitute serving aloof, self-important clients as described in his memoir ASSUMING THE POSITION). But this authorial intrusiveness is occassional, is refreshingly honest and forthright, and never veers into self-indulgence.While I might quibble with some of his assessments (Is Andrew Holleran's DANCER FROM THE DANCE really the generational equivalent of Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY?), quibbling is half the fun of reading literary criticism. I share his high regard for O'Hara, was glad to learn a little about Gertrude Stein as a writer (most critics usually write about her as a mentor to other writers), and am intrigued enough by his discussions of Glenway Wescott, Bowles, David Wojnarowicz, and Henri Cole to seek out copies of their works.No explanation is given of the captionless photographs by Iannis Delatolas that illustrate this volume. In some cases their subject is obvious (one is of Frank O'Hara's grave, others are of living writers, such as John Ashberry), in other cases their subjects evoke the characters and settings these gay authors wrote about. Whatever their purpose, they're a nice addition.Whitaker has produced another interesting book on gay culture and lifestlye. I look forward to seeing what he'll do next.

See the movie that inspired the Monkees (or at least, the producers of the monkees). This black and white, loosely structured film is a lot of fun. Shot and edited in an extremely short period of time, it seems to have benefited from being put in the can before anyone could fuss over it too much and leach it of its playfulness and originality. Unlike Dylan and Baez in DON'T LOOK BACK, the Beatles were playing characters, not trying to project their own PR images. And they seemed to enjoy doing so. While the Swingin' England costumes, hairstyles, and backdrop makes you wish someone had put up the pounds for color film, the b&w; camera work evokes the other great b&w; films of that era: Darling, Alfie, Georgie Girl, to name a few. What I found most amusing was how polite the Beatles were to the adults in the movie (George actually apologizes to a sports coach for running around on his "private property.") There are no clues that I could detect of the role these four baby-faced musicians would have in the counter-culture movement of the next half decade.The music is great, of course...but the songs were either shorter than I remembered, or have been edited down somewhat. It would have been nice if the second DVD had some outtakes (maybe they used every frame they shot) or news footage from the time. Instead, it contains countless interviews with just about everyone connected to the film. Interesting reminiscences, but enough is enough. (I doubt that I'll ever play the second DVD again.)More than mere nostalgia, this is a great movie!

Halberstam seems to have a young boy's crush on older, more masculine men. Like his sports books (&quot;October 1964&quot; and &quot;Summer '49&quot; about the world of baseball, and &quot;The Amateurs&quot; about the unnoted world of rowing), &quot;Firehouse&quot; is about a group of men who live in an insular world (an eviable subculture, almost). These are brave men who look after one another, test and tease one another, have trouble expressing their feelings (though Halberstam assures us they feel deeply), and do it all by some sort of finely-tuned Hemingwavian code of honor. What he presents is a sort of northern male version of &quot;Steel Magnolias.&quot; If you work in an academic institution or office setting where daily sniping, political intrigue, and constant back-biting are de rigueur, it's hard not to be seduced by the comraderie revealed in these pages.The stories of the thirteen firefighters from a single FDNY firehouse that lost their lives in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are carefully intertwined, a structural device that reinforces the sense of intimacy and interdependence that Halberstam so strongly evokes. Do not expect a dramatic depiction of what actually occurred on that tragic date, Halberstam is honest enough not to try and create details that can no more be recovered from the chaos of that day than most victims' bodies are likely to be found among the rubble. The story is in the simplicity of the firefighters' mission and training. We witness survivors wondering at their &quot;luck,&quot; the odd circumstances that put them somewhere else when their company was called to action. It is to Halberstam's credit that he does not presume to understand or explain these painful ironies.If you read the article Halberstam wrote for Vanity Fair on the same subject, you will be hard pressed to find additional details in this &quot;expanded&quot; version. But that's not a reason to dismiss the book. Halberstam gives us a glance at a world most of us assumed disappeared years ago. A world where honest, unpretentious people care deeply for their comrades, take their responsibilties seriously, and give of themselves sacrificially.The book is a &quot;keeper&quot; and is going on my shelf with other gender studies titles, like E. Anthony Rotundo's &quot;American Manhood&quot; and Clifford Putney's &quot;Muscular Christianity.&quot;

I picked up this book at a friend's recommendation. It is the first (but certainly won't be the last) book I've read by Barnes. Although the story putatively deals with an aging scholar's research into (and physical search for) Loulou, a parrot mentioned in Flaubert's &quot;Un coeur simple,&quot; it covers much larger issues--the relationship of art and life, the dubious nature of literary legacies, the value and role of medicine, the status of women, the importance (or lack of: discuss) marital fidelity. Barnes certainly has a great love and deep knowledge of French literature, but the writing style he adopted for this novel reminds me more of James Joyce's Ulysses with each chapter employing a different literary genre while cleverly linking across chapters to other key thoughts and themes. Its comparative brevity (just over 200 pages), however, makes it easier for the (committed) reader to master and enjoy than Joyce's masterpiece. There's a lot here to explore and think about, and the more effort readers put into it the more they'll get out of it. On my first read through, I mostly enjoyed the Flaubert trivia; upon rereading I plan to pay closer attention to the doctor/scholar-narrator in order to discover more clues about his burdens, motives, and obsessions.Although it probably helps to have read a lot of Flaubert before diving into this novel, I think the only book the reader really needs to be familiar with is &quot;Madame Bovary.&quot;

This brief study of the warehouses of Manchester, England, the textile capital of the world for almost a century, is thoughtfully argued and easy to follow. If you are at all intrigued by industrial architecture in general or grandiose visions of Victorian self-importance, you will enjoy this book. The photographs, technical drawings, and archival images in this &quot;English Heritage&quot; guide are exquisite and a joy to study. Manchester's first warehouses were built when the canals connected this city to the port city of Liverpool to the west; and they multiplied and morphed with the advent of the railroads. As Manchester became a key commercial center, these utilitarian buildings became a fascinating blend of functionality and ornament. Their public faces and ground floor showrooms were designed to impress and charm clients, while the upper floors, loading bays, and hydralic systems served the functional needs of moving, storing, and compressing wares (powerful compressors were used to expel excess air from bales of cloth).By the late 1920s the textile industry had dispersed and many of the old warehouses fell into disuse. Manchester has done much to repurpose these solid old buildings--into hotels, office space, and residences, for instance. As the authors conclude, &quot;The challenge for Manchester, as with all cities, is to continue to [make] careful and informed decisions about these buildings, recognising and giving weight to their individual importance and the contribution they make to the wider cityscape.&quot;

I never read the original (1963) edition of this ground-breaking expose of the "death care industry" (to use that industry's own euphemism), so I can't compare the "Revisited" (1998) edition to it. But it seems, since Mitford primarily addresses methods and practices, that much of the earlier work has been preserved. As other Amazon reviewers have noted, it can be confusing when trying to distinguish the "then" from the "now." Sometimes you simply have to guess based on the prices being discussed. But sadly, the reader can't help but realize that in most matters regarding the disposal of our dead, what was true then (the lying to customers about the "necessity" and "benefits" of enbalming; price gouging on caskets; secretive pricing and resistance to providing itemized price quotes and invoices; etc.) remains true today.Mitford's writing is enjoyable in its own right. Her description of what happens during enbalming is downright poetic and her witty put-downs of funeral directors (who are by turns whiney, self-justifying victims and sly exploiters of the emotionally distraught). She also gives ample evidence of being an intrepid and relentless researcher; she seems to take special delight in being able to quote some of the nasty things funeral directors have said publicly about her personally.While Mitford gives some good advice on how to plan for the disposal of a loved-one (avoid making pre-need funeral arrangements; know that most funeral homes have a "don't walk" policy which means they will come down in price if you try to walk out during the negotiations; enbalming isn't necessary or required by law; consider cremation without burial; contact your local not-for-profit funeral and memorial society), this is not "Funeral Planning for Dummies." It's more of a critique of American culture on the par with other great social activist writers of the 1960s and 70s, Vance Packard, Ralph Nader, and Tom Wolfe. Read, gasp, guffaw, and generally enjoy!

This true crime story is a quick and breezy recounting of a New York murder case that took twenty-seven years to resolve. It weighs in at less than seven pages per year, though it does not pretend to be a thorough or chronological unraveling of this off-again-on-again investigation. There is no attempt to get inside the killer's brain. The killer, Frankie Koehler, was in fact known from the outset. And when all is said and done, this cold blooded killer from Hell's Kitchen comes across as the stable fulcrum between the plodding obsessiveness of the soon-to-retire detective Andy Rosenzweig and the killer's cynically manic defense attorney, &quot;Don't Worry Murray&quot; Richman. The disparity between these two men's personalities is surreal. If there was a story in how the detective and the lawyer interacted, Gourevitch doesn't tell it. The author gives his readers glimpses of the lives of many of the key players and victims, but does not provide us with any of the texture and depth of portraiture that a truly gifted storyteller might. If John Berendt (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) is Rubens, Gourevitch is a cartoonist or quick sketch artist. He expects each gesture to speak volumes; few do. Where his brevity and superficiality pay off is in the creation of a sense of how given to chance and circumstance anyone's life is. However, to call this book an existential look at a criminal act would be more than generous. Even so, it makes you wonder how many crimes go unresolved due to lethargy, human indifference, and careerism that favors closing a case over admitting the inability to resolve it. Worth a read if you like the true crime genre and have an hour to kill.

How many opportunities is one likely to have to read a well-regarded literary author's memoirs about (among other things) his relationship with his well-regarded author father? (Has either Susan or Benjamin Cheever even come close to matching their father's achievemtents?) It was fascinating to read about this father-son relationship from the son's point of view. While Martin clearly admired Kingsley, he was not blind to his father's weaknesses (both as a writer and as a husband); and he was fully aware of their differences on political and gender issues.But these memoirs cover Martin Amis's life up to the present, the present being several years after his father's death. While Kingsley is a key figure, he is not the only relationship that gets examined. (His portraits of his mother, Elizabeth Jane Howard, Philip Larkin, and Saul Bellow are especially vivid.) And although this is not a grim book, much of what Amis recounts is about profound losses--his own loss of innocence due to childhood sexual abuse, the loss incurred when his parents divorced, the death of a cousin at the hands of a serial killer, and the loss of friendships (especially Julian Barnes's) from the furor surrounding the publication of Amis's book, THE INFORMATION. Implied losses, delicately mentioned but never examined, are those of his relationships with the women in his life.Toward the end of the book, Amis writes, "My life, it seems to me is ridiculously shapeless. I know what makes a good narrative, and lives don't have much of that--pattern and balance, form, completion, commensurateness...but the only shape that life dependably exhibits is that of tragedy." (p. 361) It is tragedy that Amis can accept but courageously, if futilely, seems to want to protect his own children from.

Warwick Wadlington not only presents thoughtful insights into an early Faulkner masterpiece, but he provides a good overview of the work of his predecessor critics, with a special tip of the hat to Cleanth Brooks and Olga Vickery. Although Wadlington summarizes the plot in one or two paragraphs, he does so only to show how silly and misguided such an effort is. Unlike the Cliff Notes that students buy to avoid reading the actual books covered, Wadlington assumes the reader has actually read AS I LAY DYING and is eager to engage with the text more deeply. He looks at the collective story of the Bundrens from the perspective of family secrets, individual vs. corporate action, and most interestingly for me, from the perspective of "sacred economics." The novel was written just as the US was going into the Great Depression and Wadlington suggests that the book, among other things, reflects the nation's transition from the unchecked individualism of the roaring twenties to the collective action of the thirties. This is a very stimulating and compact reading of a great American classic. The book includes a chronolgy of Faulkner's life and a selective bibliography.

The only statement the publiser/editors make about how this revision differs from the landmark first edition (1985) and the well-received second edition (1995) is found on page xviii: &quot;In this fully revised edition of the NIV Study Bible, the Associate Editors and I have added hundreds of new study notes, improved the book introductions (e.g., paying greater attention to the rhetorical, structural and other literary features) and enhanced other helps.&quot;A certain amount of the &quot;Evangelical defensiveness&quot; I found bothersome in the 1995 edition has been burnt off in the nicely-conceived, thoughtful re-expression of book introductions found here. Compare, for instance, these statements from the Introduction to Job:[1995 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) the date of the man Job and his historical setting, and (2) the date of the inspired writer who composed the book.&quot;[2002 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) that of Job himself, and (2) the composition of the book.&quot;While the editors have not gone overboard trying to turn the NIVSB into a &quot;pc/inclusive language&quot; text, they have restated a few things here and there that, to my sensibilities, seemed worth fixing. For instance:[1995 ed., from Wisdom Literature Introduction] &quot;The Jews sometimes speak of the OT as the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.&quot;[2002 ed., page 725] &quot;An ancient tradition among the Jews divided the collection of their holy books into three major divisions: the Law (Pentateuch), the Prophets (Former and Latter) and the Writings.&quot;These are small but welcome changes. [For those who may be following the controversy about the &quot;Today's New International Version&quot; translation, an adaptation of the NIV which endeavors to use gender-inclusive language when both men and women are clearly being discussed or addressed, the NIVSB uses the &quot;unaltered&quot; NIV. This is a good choice for a Study Bible, since serious Bible students need to confront the patriarchy of the ancient world at some time or another. The notes, rather than the translation of the text, seems the best place to accomplish this.]Although I see nothing in the introductions and notes that should be alarming to the book's primary audience (Evangelical Christians), the NIVSB now seems worthy to be used by Christians from other Protestant traditions, as well as by the general reader who may be curious about the Bible as one of the most important texts of Western civilization.The NIVSB continues to use three &quot;icons&quot; with its introductions, charts, and notes: a &quot;seedling&quot; to suggest an item that will help the reader apply something to her/his personal life; a &quot;trowel&quot; to identify items based on archaeological discoveries; and &quot;a human head&quot; to call attention to items relating to key characters. One could read the notes carefully and dispute the way these icons have been assigned throughout the text, but the editors should be applauded for their judicious restraint. To tag more notes with icons (or to introduce more types of icons) would have created visual clutter. The publisher should also be applauded for making the icons gray instead of solid black as in the previous editon; it's easy to read around them. (I only pay close attention to the &quot;trowel&quot; icons, because I am personally curious about what in the Bible can and cannot be confirmed by external evidence; although I usually skip the &quot;seedlings&quot;--because I don't like to be told how to apply Scripture to my life--these notes often discuss key theological concepts and are equally worth reading.)The typography is improved in the 2002 edition, most notably in the center column reference system. However, I still find it difficult to know where to look when I see a superscript marker in the Scripture text (To the center column or at the foot of the Scripture text?). At some points in the text, there are two superscript markers! For example, the name &quot;Immanuel&quot; in Matthew 1:23 is followed by a roman superscript &quot;d&quot; and an italic superscript &quot;w.&quot; Oddly, both identify Isaiah 7:14 as the related text. Although, I suppose, there's nothing technically wrong with stating something more than once, I think it unnecessary in a book so tightly packed with information. The unintended effect on the reader might be to erode his/her willingness to pay attention to the notes or to bother to look things up. That would be unfortunate, indeed, because there's a lot in the revised NIV Study Bible that is worth checking out.

I enjoyed the book BLINK (on how people make conscious and unconscious decisions) so much that I decided to read THE TIPPING POINT, Gladwell's first book, subtitled "How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference." Other reviews go into depth about Glsdwell's thesis that most fads and social trends behave like viruses, so I won't repeat any of that here. What I like about Gladwell is his sense of personal joy at exploring human phenomena. He challenges many assumptions made by the institutions of Western capitalism, but does this out of a genuine curiosity and a hunger to move beyond the obvious. He's never just a predictable debunker. As someone who has a professional interest in understanding what makes one style of marketing work and another flop, I found his examples from sales and marketing (Hush Puppies; the marketing of Rebecca Wells's "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood") especially helpful (though I was surprised the word "irony" did not appear anywhere in the discussion of the revival of ever-frumpy Hush Puppies shoe when it was on the verge of extinction). I found Gladwell's life-and-death examples (teen suicide in Micronesia and the failure in the US to combat an epidemic of teen smoking), less convincing and somewhat disturbing. Or perhaps, I merely found these examples disturbing because Gladwell doesn't really have a practical suggestion on how to reverse these trends. As the virus metaphor demonstrates, human intervention is often fruitless. With viruses, you sometimes just have to let them run their course. The paperback edition includes an appendix in which Gladwell discusses the even more disturbing case of Columbine-style high school shootings.

You don't need to know New Testament Greek to follow Trobisch's arguments. Although an astute reader and clever interpreter of textual evidence, Trobisch spares us the usual myopia and nit picking textual critics like to heap upon their readers. He avoids discussions of authorial authenticity that so easily put many people on the defensive. Instead, he helps the reader appreciate larger redactional issues of how the different components of the New Testament relate to one another. By making comparisons to familiar modern publishing practices, Trobisch makes his arguments easily accessible to the modern reader (for example, he shows how the decisions publishers and editors make and the conventions they establish can affect the final form of the text as much, perhaps, as those of the authors.) There's much here I'll want to re-examine when I've done more reading in this area, but on my first read-through I found Trobisch's thesis exciting and refreshing. This book has certainly changed the way I'll be reading the New Testament from now on.Trobisch's aim was &quot;to describe the history of the Canonial Edition by analyzing the oldest existing copies and tracing the edition back to the time and place of first publication. With this method, Greek manuscripts became more important witnesses than the lists of canonical writings, quotes from biblical literature, and debates about the authenticity of certain writings, translations, and so on.&quot; (p. 37) By doing this, Trobisch is able to draw some interesting conclusions: (1) that the editors of the New Testament took great care in naming the different sections of the Bible, and in doing so validated, rather than minimized, the place of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible, (2) that the sequence of the four Gospels as we have it today is a tradition of long-standing, and one that makes good sense even though it means separating Luke from Acts (his explanation of the role of John 21 in this regard is truly fascinating, p. 96ff), (3) that the &quot;first edition&quot; of the New Testament would have positioned the General Letters after Acts and before the Letters of Paul (the logic being, in part, that the first half of Acts introduces the reader to Peter, John and James, and it is only in the second part that Acts starts to focus on the missionary efforts of Paul), (4) that the editors used an elegant system of internal cross referencing to validate both the authority of the leaders in Jerusalem and of Paul (this seeming harmony serving as a unified barrier against Marcionite error), and (5)that the editors managed to straddle the potentially devisive issue of the date upon which Easter should be celebrated by including both the Synoptic and Johannine traditions. Just to name a few! And don't skip the fascinating discussion of the codex (&quot;bound book&quot;) v. the scroll in the establishment of the Canonical Edition of the Bible (p. 69-77).I must admit the flow of Trobisch's argument was so engrossing that I never really examined the endnotes. But they're there and they're detailed. The bibliography is substantial, too (but be warned, it includes a high percentage of German works).This book is truly worth the investment (both in money and in the time you'll spend digging into it). Treat yourself!

An encylopedia of Evangelicalism--a true encyclopedia--is badly needed. This book, unfortunately, does not fill that need. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, edited by Cross and Livingstone, is a serious, carefully researched, and authoritative reference work that has always been disappointing when I've turned to it for information on American Christianity in general and Evangelical traditions in particular (for example, it contains nothing on Aimee Semple McPherson or Billy Sunday). I purchased Balmer's book hoping it would serve as a supplement to the Oxford Dictionary. While it fills some information gaps, its analysis of key issues is suprisingly superficial (when attempted at all).For the most part the Encyclopedia is more an A-to-Z quick reference to the American Evangelical subculture with special attention to the last quarter of the 20th century. By comparing the lengths of articles, you can see how major issues get reduced to brief summaries and matters of minor and transient importance get inflated beyond merit. Gospel Music gets 1/3 column of text and hymn writer Fanny Crosby, 1/2 column. But Contemporary Christian Music gets 4 columns; Amy Grant, 2 columns; Michael English, 2 columns; Sandi Patty, 2 columns; Jars of Clay, 1 1/2 columns. This is not to say that the articles on Mr. English and Ms Patty weren't interesting in a dishy, People Magazine kind of way; it's just to call into question Balmer's editorial judgment. Also of note, there is a one column entry in Exodus International, a ministry founded in 1976 to rescue homosexuals and lesbians from their deviant lifestyle, but nothing on Evangelicals Concerned, a more gay-affirming national evangelical ministry founded one year earlier. The absurdity of what gets emphasized and what doesn't is thrown into high relief by the frequently cross-referenced half column article on Ronald Wilson Reagan. While it gives the date he became governor of California, it does not say when he was elected president of the United States; nor does it cite even one book or article we can turn to for a deeper analysis of Reagan's political and religious views.By way of comparison, the longest article I was able to locate in the Encyclopedia is the one on Methodism (8 columns of text). The one on Evangelicalism runs one column shorter. Considering its brevity it does a reasonably good job of giving a succinct overview of the subject. I found one statement in this article especially helpful in understanding the editorial perspective behind entire Encyclopedia: "Evangelicalism in America has largely retained [these] characteristics: the centrality of conversion, the quest for an affective piety, and a suspicion of wealth, worldliness, and ecclesiastical pretension."The complaint of superficiality and noncritical presentation of topics is further evidenced in the works referenced at the ends of articles. Often the source cited is the official organ of the church body or organization under discussion, rarely a more scholarly work. Similarly, for articles on people, the editors cite those persons' autobiographies. While I'm sure I'd find Fanny Crosby's autobiography fascinating, I would also like to know if a more analytical work written by a church historian or musicologist exists.Another frustrating thing about this book, which is perhaps common to all first editions of reference books, is the evidence of sloppy or rushed copy editing. For instance, there is a frequent bold-faced cross reference to an article on Modernism; when you turn to Modernism there is no article, but you are sent to the article on Liberalism; at Liberalism (not the exact equivalent of Modernism in my thinking) you get a short article and a cross reference back to Modernism. Ooops! There is also some sloppiness with dates: David Livingstone, who was born in 1813, is said to have made his first trip to Africa in 1741; Aimee Semple McPherson, who died in 1944, is said to have been buried in October 1994.Even with the aforementioned gripes, this book provides some interesting and lively reading. The articles on McPherson and Cyrus Ingersoll Scofield, for instance, were actually quite touching. And there is the occasional useful fact (Did you know that Goshen College has the largest collection of information on Anabaptism and the Reformation in America?). This books is perhaps best appreciated as self-directed casual reading. So if you find yourself one night unable to fall asleep for fear that the Rapture will occur before you have a chance to repent of your latest sins, this is the book you'll want to have on your bedside table.

James R. Gaines cleverly juxtaposes and interweaves the life stories of composer J. S. Bach and Prussian king Frederick the Great to depict a world in transition--from the Age of Faith to the Enlightenment (and subsequently, the Romantic and Modern eras). The point of contact upon which this dual biography pivots is a visit (make that "a respsonse to a summons") in which the elderly composer is invited to the young king's palace where he is given a challenge to extemporize a musical composition upon a theme presented by the King. The result is a masterpiece known as "Musical Offering" (BWV 1079). Gaines does an excellent job of bringing history to life, giving modern readers just enough detail to communicate a sense that the story he's recounting actually took place in another era when different customs and values held sway. (The many deaths of close family members that Bach lived through growing up and in his early adulthood are unfathomable today in developed nations; and the psychological and physical abuse prince Frederick suffered at the hands of his father would be classified as criminal.) Gaines, likewise, does an excellent job of concisely explaining musical terms and concepts. EVENING IN THE PALACE OF REASON is a lively story well told. Gaines provides a very helpful selected bibliography and discography. If you're like me, you'll want to intersperse your reading of this book with careful listenings to Bach's choral and instrumental works. I recommend having at leastBach: The Art of Fugue; Musical Offeringon hand.

"I promise you," has to be the most uttered phrase in this excrutiatingly tense psycodrama. Dripping with implausibility (people leave their cell phones on even as they are sneaking up behind people with guns who want to kill them), it is made compelling by its powerhouse acting, frequent plot twists, and paranoid visions of families challenged by relentless dark forces. I say "families" (plural) because this drama cleverly interweaves the destinies of several different families, not just the family of key character Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland), the head of the CIA's Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit. As the series opens Jack and his wife Teri (Leslie Hope) are trying to mend their troubled marriage when their only child, daughter Kimberly, is kidnapped. For this family, the events of the next 24 hours forces them to reestablish their bonds. Another family drama that unfolds is that of Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). Jack's assignment is to protect the Senator and his family from a known assassination plot. As the day unfolds the Senator slowly comes to realize how little he knows the other members of his seemingly "picture perfect" family. And playing off against these two families are the Drazens, the terrorists behind the abductions and assassination attempts...showing, I guess, that villains need love too, and have family bonds as strong as "good" people (but I guess if you also watch The Sopranos, you knew that already). And yet another family is apparent in the mix--Jack's family of coworkers down at CTU headquarters. What we have is a complete smorgasbord of dysfunctional families ricocheting through a single day, clashing and combusting occasionally, but mostly proceeding according to their own perverse logic. Everyone's loyalty is questioned at some point, friends become captors and captors friends. But through it all everyone manages to stay in touch through cell phones and satellite technology. "Patch me through," is the second most uttered phrase.As exciting as the series is, it does have its false moments. I found the frequent I love you's and I'm sorry's a little hard to take. And there's one scene when Senator Palmer manages to break away from his secret security protectors in order to conduct some business. He encounters a couple of vandals in a parking garage, spews a little presidential-timber type jargon at them, and manages to get away without a physical encounter. The scene felt like an out-take from "Stand and Deliver." Oh, and there's the de rigueur amnesia scene in which both the onset and recovery are the result of traumatic emotional shocks.Technology is ubiquitous and glamorous in this story. Gunfire virtually unending. It's tempting to say "Don't anyalyze this story. Just roll with the punches and enjoy the ride." But "24" has a lot to say about human values, the fragility of the family, the false faces we present to the world to achieve our equally false goals, the myth of individuality, and the myth that we lose our individuality when we join forces with others, and the arbitrary nature of risk and choice. Try watching the "24" episodes in quick succession. I promise you, when the ride is over, you'll have plenty to think about.

This extended journalistic essay is a fun ride. I like that Gladwell drew his examples from a wide variety of professions and contexts: the world of marketing and advertising (the Pepsi challenge), the buying and exhibition of antique art (the Getty's purchase of a fraudulant kouros), political campaigning (Warren G. Harding and Bill Clinton), rock music (the not-easy-to-classify artist Kenna), hospital emergency triage work (Cook County Hospital's introduction of a simple diagnotic protocol to determine which chest pain patients were most likely to succumb to a full-blown heart attack), orchestra auditions (the increasing use of "blind" auditions to force judges to base their assessments solely on what they hear), and police work (the Rodney King and Amadou Diallo fiascos). He augments these ancedotal findings with more scientific studies (such as findings from an extensive breakdown and cataloguing of facial expressions and work with an autistic man). The snap decisions we make, called "thin slicing," can help us make urgent, life-saving decisions, or can (under certain circumstances) guide us to make the most disastrous of choices. Gladwell seems to be fair in considering the pros and cons, but in the end his project seems mainly to be to inspire in us a sense of awe for the powerful gift we all have, one which ultimately eludes logical explanation.Great for the beach on long train ride.

If you're fascinated by the 1960s, you'll love Davis's take of Truman Capote's legendary black and white ball held in the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza Hotel in November 1966. Davis has a gift for not patronizing her readers. To those readers who were living, thinking, socially conscious adults in the 60s and can personally recall Capote's self-aggrandizing antics, she retells the familiar story in a unique and lively manner. For those readers coming to this story very much after-the-fact, she succinctly provides all the necessary background information without overloading the story with unnecessary details. What I enjoyed most was Davis's ability to convey the tone and mood of the era she's describing. Nineteen sixty-six, in retrospect, seems to have been a pivotal year. Positioned as it was at the virtual midpoint between the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers, it is neither a time of great optimism (American jingoism) nor a time of open rebellion. But clearly, the old order is beginning to fray at the seams. The anxiety people felt over not being invited to what promised to be "the party of the century" is hard to fathom today and is almost touching in its pathos. And to read over the list of "the invited" (which Davis provides as an appendix) is in a strange way somewhat comforting. Whatever their faults, these people (with the possible exception of Lee Radziwill) were at least famous because of their accomplishments or social status. But clearly the era of celebrities who would be "famous solely for being famous" was not far off, and Davis does a good job of suggesting its immanence. One can't help wondering if Capote's party didn't in some way help to bring it about. The last two chapters ("Hangover" and "Afterword") close the story with sobering accounts of Capote's artistic decline and of what eventually happened to some of Capote's famous guests. As social history or memento mori, THE PARTY OF THE CENTURY is a thoroughly satisfying read.

If you loved Lynne Truss's rant on sloppy punctuation, EATS SHOOTS AND LEAVES, you're likely to enjoy hearing her go off on the general decline of manners. Like the earlier book TALK TO THE HAND is great airplane and waiting room reading. She admits that this little book is not intended to be a thoroughgoing treatment of her subject (for those you'll have to consult her brief bibliography). But she does seem to dredge up a lot of complaints that any reader will be able to identify with. In fact, most readers will probably be distracted by their own inner thoughts and their own impulse to top her outrageous stories with some of their own. We've all had experiences with rude and indifferent store clerks and have overheard embarrassing (or annoying or frightening) cell phone conversations. Truss is a lively writer who indulges in a lot of British slang (some of which I couldn't find in my British Slang Dictionary). This book is a little less structured (and probably less helpful) than EATS SHOOTS AND LEAVES, but fun nonetheless.

It pains me not to give this movie five stars. What a magnificent failure! What fluff and froth! The perfect movie to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon...or at 2:00 am when you find yourself suddenly awake and incapable of going back to sleep. CSTM is "quicker picker-upper" Nancy Walker's sole directorial effort (she's quoted on the DVD extra, "The Village People Story," as defining movies as "nothing but little pieces of ... snipped together"). Like Mae West's 1978 box office dud, "Sextette," CSTM has just about everything you'd expect to find in a camp classic (beautiful men, clever women, music, over-produced self-spoofing dance numbers, costumes, costumes, and more costumes)...everything except wit, that is. But camp humor is most successful when directed against a staid and self-satisfied oppressive regime. And CSTM (like "Sextette" before it) was conceived when disco was thriving, acceptance of gay and bi culture was at its peak, and most people still believed "whatever people did was okay as long as they didn't hurt anyone." Double entendres just don't have a reason to exist when there is no moral overlord to subvert. By the time CSTM was released in 1980, disco was as dead as Duncan in Act 2, Scene 3 of "Macbeth." A year later, rumors of a "gay cancer" would change the mood of the gay community forever (in fact, a decade later AIDS would take the life of Jacques Morali, one of CSTM's creators).One wonders who Walker turned to for advice while making this film. It is a veritable Cornell box of filmic allusions (one thinks immediately of her own explanation of what she was doing). In defter hand, say Truffaut's, these efforts might be considered homages. But in Walker's, they seem to be more the bold thievings of a street Arab desperate to grab anything that might be sellable. Among the plundered are: Busby Berkeley (especially, "The Gang's All Here"), Howard Hawks (compare the YMCA number with Jane Russell's efforts to play games with the Olympic team in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"), "My Sister Eileen" (does anyone in Greenwich Village have an apartment the size of the ones in these two movies?), and every Mick and Judy "gee, it would be swell to put on a show" MGM musical. And then there's Marilyn Sokol, who turns in a fine performance in the Nancy Walker role of the homely-but-horny sidekick of the beautiful blonde lead. The Village People were great just being themselves. The only real disappointment was Bruce Jenner. He's not an actor and he has a high nasal voice that seems at odds with his athletic physique. One wonders if co-star Valerie Perrine wasn't speaking to Jenner the actor, rather than to his character, when she said, "It takes more than a pretty face."My one remaining question is, if "Can't Stop the Music" is finally out on DVD, can "Valley of the Dolls" be far behind? Hey, Hollywood, what are you waiting for?!!!?

Mark Morris commits &quot;double travesty&quot; in this dance set to Purcell's seventeenth century opera--he plays both Dido, the noble queen of Carthage smitten by the visiting hero Aeneas, and the bawdy sorceress determined to undermine their liaison. The gender-bending and double-mindedness of Morris's interpretation of an opera originally performed at a girl's school is fascinating and highlights the opera's ambivalence about love and the possibility of finding happiness in this world. Pathos and humor get equal play. And Morris daringly switches roles without reliance on gimmicks such as masks or costume changes. His personality changes (for the sorceress is certainly the unfulfilled shadow side of Queen Dido) are signaled only by gesture and expression. It should be noted that Morris is not the only dancer performing more than one role. All the dancers wear the same gender-neutral black tunics as Morris, even as they play the queen's attendants in one scene and witches or sailors in others. The effect is to force us to focus on what is universal--love and the tragedy of loss.Having seen DIDO AND AENEAS performed live, I can say that Barbara Willis Sweete has created a film masterpiece. She rightly places the attention on the dancers, though she effectively integrates the singers into the visual landscape. Ensemble numbers are creatively and intelligently photographed. The viewer is never cheated out of any significant dance phrase or gesture. For my money, this is the best dance-to-film adaptation I have seen to date.The DVD includes an on-screen biography of Purcell (but should have included ones for Morris and Sweete as well). There are easy-to-read English subtitles to the sung English text. This is nice to have, though I would rather this were a feature I could turn off or on as I saw fit.Overall, an exciting and beautifully done film. It's one dance lovers will want to watch over and over.

I bought this DVD after hearing one or two cuts from one of Diana Krall's CDs at a friend's apartment. I loved her smokey, hollow reed voice and jazzy phrasings. The DVD is really my first serious exposure to her work. And it's marvelous. It's like a little time travel trip back to the early and mid-60s when jazz was at its most sophisticated. Her interpretations (both vocal and on the piano) are cool and exciting without being clever or abstract. And the mid-60s was a great era for female vocalists. Krall seems to channel and blend the best of them--such as Dusty Springfield (compare their versions of Bacharach's &quot;The Look of Love&quot;), Nancy Wilson, Sarah Vaughn, and Astrid Gilberto--all without sacrificing her own astonishing originality. Interestingly, in her final encore number Krall reveals another one of her mucical personae when she gives a solo performance at the piano of a song by fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell (&quot;A Case of You&quot;). On top of giving a dynamite performance of some really great standards, she shows herself to be a generous performer, frequently and sincerely acknowledging her fellow musicians and the arrangers of the various numbers (she even brings the legendary Claus Ogerman out on stage).Besides the full concert (with some interesting footage of the streets of Paris intercut at various points), there are two bonus videos and three numbers from her rehearsal with the Orchestre Symphonique Europeen. This is one DVD that will give you many hours of pleasure. There's a lot here to enjoy...over and over again.

Being a lover of books in their most traditional form (the texture and color of the paper they are printed on, the typefaces chosen, their binding, and the dust jackets that nostalgically reflect the era in which a book was first published), I never thought I would go for any kind of e-book. But having acquired a Kindle for work-related purposes I have really come to love it. Here are some of the reasons:1. It holds a lot of text. I have downloaded 3 English Bibles, the complete works of Shakespeare, Twain, and Chekhov, plus many current novels and biographies. Now when I travel or go on vacation, I don't have to struggle to decide which books from my personal library I want to take with me. Now I can take my entire library.2. The "page" is very easy on the eyes and the type size is adjustable. If my eyes are a little tired from sitting in front of the computer all day at work, I can choose a larger font size after hours when I'm doing my personal reading. And, if I want to quicly skim large amounts of text, I can choose a smaller font.3. It's portable and easy to use. Books and magazines just don't cooperate when you put them on the reading rack on exercise equipment. The Kindle does! And if the reading rack is a little further away than you'd like, just pump up the type size.4. It's eco-friendly. There are many books I want to read but am unlikely to ever re-read. More and more, it seems selfish and wrong to "kill a tree" for my reading pleasure.5. Access to a wide range of low-cost public domain works. You'd be surprised how many classic books are available at less than $2.00. This means fewer trips to the libary and a smaller carbon footprint.6. The ability to download books instantly anytime, anywhere you can get a cellphone signal. When I'm reading, I often come across the name of another book, subject, or author I want to read about. Now, instead of writing myself a note, I can go to the Kindle store. I can either buy the book immediately or get a free sample chapter and make up my mind later. Also, the more you shop the better Amazon gets at predicting which books in its growing library you are likely to enjoy. I'm always astonished how accurate Amazon's recommendations are.7. Highlighting text. I use this more than the Notes feature. It's like underlining text with a pencil in paper books (I say "pencil" because it's easy to delete the highlighting whenever you no longer need it.)8. It's impossible to lose a book. Even if your Kindle is stolen or you drop it in the swimming pool, Amazon remembers what books you've purchased and will allow you to upload them to your next Kindle without purchasing them again. (Yes, you will have to purchase the replacement Kindle, but not having to buy books a second time should give you real peace of mind.)9. Amazon archives books you've finished reading. You can delete books from your reader to make space for new books, then reload them at a later date if you want to re-read them.

This film is more than a portrait of a choreographer. It is a portrait of his company. And of the small, not-for-profit arts institution in America. From beginning to end the viewer gets a glimpse of what it takes for such an institution to survive and remain creative in an environment that doesn't always appreciate innovation and creativity. Director Matthew Diamond (himself a former dancer and choreographer) has done an excellent job of interweaving rehearsal and live performances with archival footage and talking heads (dance critics, administrative staff, technical crew, dancers, former dancers, and Taylor himself all get their say). Taylor comes across, in turns, as impish (fabricating stories to please the press), vague (struggling to communicate new steps to his dancers), nervous (constantly chewing gum), fearful (&quot;my inspiration comes from fear&quot;), and autocratic (in the course of the film he fires one of his dancers). But most of all, Taylor comes across as insecure and vulnerable. One especially telling moment in the film comes when the company is performing in India and the sound system fails. The dancers continue dancing in silence while the crew busies itself trying to fix the problem. The music comes back on and the company is in perfect sync. Taylor revealingly says, &quot;My dance was ruined. And they were the heroes, not me. They stole the show.&quot; As one former company member put it when describing Taylor's origins: &quot;There was [Martha] Graham and then there was this big dysfunctional family, and Paul Taylor was one of them....And they all brought their own dysfunction to their own companies.&quot;The director should be applauded for the way he avoided dance cliches and dull, straight-on filming of dance performances. Especially exciting was the from-the-wings view of the energetic &quot;Esplanade&quot; that opens the film. And the most entrancing sequence is the male solo from &quot;Aureole.&quot; For this, Diamond has intercut a current rehearsal of Patrick Corbin learning the dance with three different archival versions of Taylor performing the same work. The music continues seamlessly as the visuals switch from one point in time to another, suggesting without preaching, that dances have a life of their own...and a good one has a chance of outlasting any of its interpreters. Diamond's other dance films include &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; (also Paul Taylor's company) and &quot;A Balanchine Celebration,&quot; fine and important films in their own right, though not equal to this masterpiece.

Luciano's message is both served and undermined by her mesmerizing and even-toned prose. I found myself at times wishing that she would get on a soap box and spew alarmist Vance-Packard-like jeremiads. I wanted her to denounce the predatory industries--medical, pharmaceutical, fitness, clothing, advertising--that seem to conspire to make people (in this case, men) so discontent (and preoccupied) with themselves. But Luciano is careful not to do this. The responsibility for this mad obsession with looking good (read &quot;young&quot;) must be shared. Beginning with the 50s Organizational Man, Luciano traces how men's attitudes about themselves, their place in the economy, and their relationship with women has evolved in the last half-century. Though she presents more than adequate data (statistical and anecdotal) to make her points (her descriptions of hair-replacement and penile enlargement surgeries are not for the squeamish), it is her ability to interpret the broader economic, societal, and psychological issues that make &quot;Looking Good&quot; such a fascinating read.If you read and enjoy this book, you'll probably also enjoy &quot;The Male Body: A New Look at Men in Public and in Private&quot; by Susan Bordo. Bordo's take on this subject is more personal. I find it interesting that two of the most insightful books written about men recently have come from the pens of female academics.

One girl and three guys--it does J&J one better. I always wondered why Jules and Jim bothered with "the girl" at all when they were obviously one another's true soul mates. Although WILD REEDS is not a gay film, it does have one gay character who has a couple of classmates who seem to be either bisexual or open to experimentation. The four adolescent leads in this movie are struggling with their sense of being an outsider, which seems to be a universal for boys and girls, straights and gays alike. At the same time that they are trying to come to terms with their sexual natures, they are developing a sense of their place in the world. Each of them is affected by the political issues of their day (the war in Algeria), the struggle against authoritarian school teachers, and the expectations of their families. What I found appealing about the way the characters were portrayed and developed is that each one seems to receive equal treatment, has an equal share of grief and confusion, and is equally susceptible to normal human foibles. To wish that the story lines were more resolved at the end of the film would be to ask that this thoughtful little movie be something it was not meant to be--a splashy, big-budget Hollywood film totally ungrounded in human reality.

If Augusten Burroughs ever makes a movie or gets to host his own reality TV show he might one day work his way into the center square of a future iteration of Hollywood Squares. He has the wit. He's a clever observer of contemporary mores. Add to this an ample supply of contempt for political correctness and a love for pushing the boundaries of taste. In the "true stories" that make up MAGICAL THINKING he manages to get away with virtual murder because half the time the target of his cutting satire is himself. Arranged somewhat chronologically, these stories read like outtakes from his memoirs RUNNING WITH SCISSORS. The collection begins with a story about his effort to achieve stardom at age seven when he was selected to be in a Tang commercial ("Commercial Break") and includes one about his studying to become a Barbizon model in his teens ("Model Behavior"). It includes frank stories about his dysfunctional family of origin, alcoholism, gayness, dating woes, relations with Catholic priests, boredom and frustration as an advertising copywriter, and even his "hygiene issues." "Debby's Requirements," one of my favorites in the collection, is a New York story about Burroughs' battle of wills with a domineering cleaning lady. In "The Rat/Thing" he takes the New York thing to extremes when he reveals what he will do to get rid of a rodent intruder. It's so extreme you can't help thinking he might be using his little domestic tempest in a teapot to describe something much larger--the obsessive Western mind (e.g., Bush v. Saddam). He both revels in and criticizes American obsession with celebrity culture and aspirational advertising. Shallowness (especially in gay men) is both scorned and celebrated. The collection ends on a slightly more reassuring note with several stories about a still-promising sounding relationship with a man named Dennis. I think we'll have to wait for the next collection of "true stories" to see how that one turns out.

I bought this book mainly because I saw that it had an introduction by Alain de Botton, author of THE CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY, and because I've been wanting to become more familiar with the works of Plato. First of all, the &quot;Introduction,&quot; only six pages long, should have been called a &quot;Foreword.&quot; It was clearly something de Botton had written on another occasion or without reference to the work it was going to be attached to. While it is interesting in its own right, it's the sort of thing a person could read very easily while standing in the aisle of a bookstore.THE ESSENTIAL PLATO is essentially a repackaging of a public domain work (The Quality Paperback Book Club seems to do a lot of this sort of thing). In fairness, it presents hefty chunks of Plato's works (The Republic and The Trial and Death of Socrates in full, plus selections from sixteen other works). The translation is by Benjamin Jowett, first published in 1871. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature this was a popular translation in its day, though one that was criticized by scholars. It's surprisingly modern and very readable. De Botton's introduction is followed by short introductions on Plato's Life, Writings, and Philosophy. They are uncredited, but I suspect they were authored either by Jowett or by the editorial staff of the original publisher. Each work has an extensive introduction of its own (also uncredited). While the introductions seem thorough and the information they give plausible, I kept finding myself wondering if they didn't represent &quot;old scholarship.&quot; There are no annotations, cross-references, or any other helps.Not a rip-off exactly, but I'm sure I'm going to have to look elsewhere for definitive editions of Plato's works.

What is not clear from the listing for this book in most of OUP's promotional materials is that THE OXFORD STYLE MANUAL is really TWO books in one: THE OXFORD GUIDE TO STYLE and THE OXFORD DICTIONARY FOR WRITERS AND EDITORS. Even at the combined length of just over 1,000 pages, THE MANUAL is a manageable reference work, no more cumbersome than a standard collegiate dictionary.Although, as an American, I will continue to use the CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE as my arbiter for editorial decisions, I find Oxford's manual an excellent way of distinguishing between British and American styles of English; Part II (the dictionary) is especially thorough in pointing out key differences. Also, beginning on page 244 in Part I is a list of about 500 everyday American words with their British equivalents (tick-tack-toe = noughts and crosses). Although it would be nice to have the same list in reverse (an American's undershirt is a &quot;vest&quot; in UK, and his vest is a &quot;waistcoat&quot;, something that is not immediately clear from the way the list is put together), the list is short enough for anyone to read through and become familiar with. (The CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE has no equivalent list.)In short, a good and thorough resource.

Pepsi or Coca Cola? ER or Chicago Hope? David Sedaris or David Rakoff? We all have our preferences. I prefer Coke, Chicago Hope, and Rakoff. They all have the right amount of bite for my taste. Rakoff, while sharing many of Sedaris's virtues--wit, self-effacing humor, a take-it-or-leave-it attitude about his being gay--Rakoff's essays are less rambling and have a point. Even though he could be accused of writing soft journalism and doesn't do any heavy duty investigation (he's either a fatalist or just plain lazy), he does hold a mirror up to his readers (presumably mostly middle-class Americans) and asks us to think about what we do (and why), and what our actions say about where our values lie. His essays touch on a swimsuit photo shoot, looking for edible roots and shoots in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the last flight of the grossly inefficient Concorde, a Yuppie scavenger hunt in Manhattan, penis puppets as Broadway entertainment, serving the beautiful people in a South Beach hotel, tourists who would rather stand in the cold to watch the Today Show from outside the NBC studio than take in New York's many cultural offerings, the Paris rag trade, the futility and inanity of gay Republicans, the ethical dilemmas of cosmetic surgeons, the pettiness of a "fasting guru," and the absurdity of cryonics (those wackos who want to be frozen when they die and revivified when science has figured out how to cure the illnesses that killed them and can reverse the other unpleasant aspects of aging). Rakoff asks his readers to take a good look at themselves and reflect on what they see. As Rakoff himelf says, "I have seen the future and I'm fairly relieved to say, it looks nothing like me" (p. 222). As Americans we have big dreams, high expectations. Maybe it's time, Rakoff seems to be saying, for us to cultivate a little humility.

Having signed this book out of my Queens branch library, I am eagerly waiting for my personal copy from Amazon.com.This book contains 230 photographs of Richmond Hill, Queens, many dating to its roots when it was a still quiet Long Island farm community in the late 1800s. While I wished the authors had provided a more richly contexted introduction, it is basically a picture book, and as such, deserves to be enjoyed on its own terms. (It should be noted, however, that each picture has a generous caption.) Sure to be of interest to people interested in the history of New York City's "other borroughs" and of Long Island, Victorian architecture, and Americana in general. The chapters on "A Common Faith and Temples of Education" and "The Celebrated of Richmond Hill" were my personal favorites. Former residents include, photojournalist/reformer Jacob Riis, Phil Rizutto, composer Morton Gould, Ernest Ball (composer of "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling"), and the Marx Brothers (their home still exists and bears a commemorative plaque). Babe Ruth and Mae West were known to dine at the Triangle Hoffbrau restaurant (though I presume never together). The book includes the full text of Teddy Roosevelt's 1903 whistle stop campaign speech. Besides a longer introduction, I wish the book had a "then-and-now" map. When the village was first laid out streets were given names (like Elm Street, Oak Street, etc.); after the village was incorporated into Greater New York along with the rest of Queens, streets were stripped of these picturesque monikers and came to be identified by numbers (even with this innovation, any motorist without satellite navigation will tell you it's nearly impossible to find one's way around Queens...and for those of us who live here, that's just fine).Overall, I would say Ballenas and Cataldi have produced a nice piece of nostalgia which serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in learning more about this part of Queens.

The second half of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS (affectionately known to AAers as "The Big Book") consists of a collection of life stories from people in recovery. They provide a different perspective on alcoholism and recovery than one gets from the program's "great white fathers," Bill W. and Dr. Bob, whose life stories are integrated into the first part of the Big Book. Alcoholism knows no prejudice. It's an equal opportunity destroyer. It strikes women as well as men, the young and the old, all social classes and races. The stories in the Big Book make this clear. (It even includes the story of an American Indian, quite progressive, I thought, for 1955!) But it doesn't contain the story of any openly gay men or lesbians. Augusten Burroughs's DRY fills that gap.DRY picks up where his earlier volume of memoirs, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, left off. Burroughs is brutally honest about himself and his shortcomings (in fact, you could say DRY is one long written 5th step). In fact, he's so honest with himself it's hard to believe he was ever able to muster up enough denial to keep his addiction going for so many years. But he admits in RWS to being an indefatigable journal keeper, so I guess he had notes to refer to once the alcoholic haze started to lift. Other reviewers have commented on Burroughs's dry wit, and the humor is definitely there. I found myself constantly putting little checkmarks in the margins next to bonmots I wanted to revisit (or steal and use at dinner sometime). For instance, "Alcohol time is very different from sober time. Alcohol time is slippery whereas sober time is like cat hair. You just can't get rid of it." Anyone in recovery is apt to know exactly what he means. But if you can look beyond the surface humor, there is a painfully tragic reality to these kinds of observations. The humor makes the pain palatable for the reader--as it probably did for the author himself. But I would encourage readers to let themselves linger over some of the painful passages in DRY. Recovery is slow, illogical, messy, circuitous, boring, and unattractive at times. If you're gay and think you may have a problem with drugs and alcohol, Burroughs knows what you're going through--DRY may be just the book for you. If you're a gay person in recovery, Burroughs really keeps it green!If you spend a lot of time in the car or on the stairmaster, Burroughs has recorded the entire text of DRY onto CDs. He's a good reader of his own work, though it's a pretty straightforward, nondramatic reading. It's just hard to believe he lived to tell the tale.

"Brokeback Mountain" is by far the most thoughtfully constructed, powerfully wrought, and emotionally convincing story in this volume of short stories by Pulitzer Prize winner Annie Proulx; it is well-placed at the end of the collection. Yes, it's hard to be gay in Wyoming. But according to Proulx, it's hard to be a woman (married, widowed, or single; old or young), rancher, ranch hand, rodeo cowboy, physically handicapped, a store owner, husband, parent, sibling, or sushi-chef in Wyoming as well. The story of Leland Lee's efforts to make a living and find his place in the world told in "Job History" concludes with the acerbic comment, "Nobody has time to listen to the news." Getting by in the new West, it seems, takes everything a person's got to give--and no one has time, thought, or energy to ponder what's going on in the wider world.Apart from "Brokeback Mountain, it's difficult to tell if Proulx views her characters with compassion or whether she is simply studying them with the detachment of a research scientist. Her portraits are unsentimental to be sure; at times she is as harsh and unyeilding as the western landscape, as relentless as the Wyoming wind. And it is not unusual for her attention and loyalty to shift from one character to another in the course of a single story. This can be disconcerting and frustrating if you come to these stories with the expectation that they will follow traditional story-telling patterns used in most stories intended for the magazine market. As in her follow-up volume of Wyoming stories, BAD DIRT, the longer stories are Proulx's better ones. They give her the room she needs to expose the tensions within extended family and community relations, often across multiple generations. They read like highly distilled epics. Perhaps the best of these in this volume are "The Mud Below," "The Bunchgrass Edge of the World," and "Pair of Spurs."

While I prefer the NRSV translation over the NIV, and the HarperCollins Study Bible (with Apocrypal/Deuterocanonical books) over this Study Bible, I do read the NIV Study Bible to better understand Evangelical positions on matters of dates, authorship, and interpretation.This is decidedly a Protestant Bible (the copyright holder, the International Bible Society, has made it clear that they have no intention of ever translating the Apocrypha...not even as interesting literature from the biblical period); more specifically, Evangelical from a Christian Reformed Church tradition...if you look close enough you can see the shadow of Calvin across its pages. That said, I feel the introductions and notes are well-done and helpful. Unlike the Scofield Reference Bible, it does not foist an extreme dispensationalist or fundamentalist world view on its readers. It has a number of helpful in-text charts and maps (I keep the charts on the Hebrew Calendar, Old Testament Sacrifices, and Old Testament Feasts & Sacred Days permanently tagged for quick reference). It also has a helpful 150-page concordance.My gripes: (1) Words of Jesus in red (I find this device silly and hard to read), (2) Center column cross references are marked with superscript alpha letters, the same as the textual footnote system...yes, one system uses italic and the other roman letters, but as small and light as these call-out markers are it's impossible to distinguish them, and (3) some of the book introductions are a little too defensive for my taste (the authors favor the earliest possible date for the apocalyptic book of Daniel in opposition to most mainstream biblical scholars).I understand that a revised and updated NIV Study Bible is going to be released by the publisher later this year. I'm sure I'll buy it, but I hope it rectifies some of the weaknesses of the current edition.

The pieces in this latest collection by Augusten Burroughs seem to be from various points in his life and reflect his lost childhood, dysfunctional years as an alcoholic creative for an ad agency, and his less than perfect efforts as a person in recovery to figure out how normal people make life decisions and navigate human relationships (and pet ownership). While the pieces (which I want to call "stories") are uneven, all are marked by Burroughs' trademark wit and indifference to political correctness. As with his previous books, his harshest criticisms are directed toward himself. At times this can be draining; sometimes, even creepy (as in "Team Player" where he talks about stealing a Harvard tee shirt from a hotel room, or in "Peep" where he reveals his tendency toward voyeurism). The most hilarious story in this collection is "Mint Threshold" where he describes the nadir of his advertising career, working on the Junior Mint account. The most touching story is "The Forecast for Sommer," about the suicide of one of his mother's proteges. In this story and in some of the other pieces, his mother comes across as more fully human than in RUNNING WITH SCISSORS. She seems to have authentically loved her son and to have believed him to have great potential, something that never comes across in the previously published material. She remains a deeply flawed and tortured individual, but Augusten seems to have more compassion for her plight and a more nuanced understanding of her essence than before. Perhaps this is his way of making amends to her--a sign that he is working his recovery.One interesting thing to note is the disclaimer that appears at the front of the book (and I guess all post-A-Million-Little-Pieces memoirs will have something similiar): "Some of the events described happened as related; others were expanded and changed. Some of the individuals portrayed are composites of more than one person, and many names and identifying characteristics have been changed as well."

If you're at all interested in practical ethics (Is there any other kind?), you'll be fascinated with Hornby's HOW TO BE GOOD. Told from the perspective of a woman doctor whose misanthropic husband suddenly stumbles across his own personal stash of holiness, coincidentally at the time the good doctor is engaging in a half-hearted love affair. The husband's newfound spirituality and concern for the poor sends Dr. Carr and the couple's two children into a bit of a tailspin. Everyone in the family must wrestle with what it means to be good (and to be "good enough). Like Voltaire's great satire, the puzzled heroine-narrator is forced to confront many of society's sacred cows (New Age spirituality, conventional charity, the Church, careerism, marital fidelity, the nuclear family, art, literature, and the role of pop culture).Hornby's ability to draw flawed but likeable characters infused with wit and humor (even the children) keeps this somewhat uneventful novel from ever becoming dull or pointless. In the end, I very much identified with Dr. Carr and her ambiguous feelings about everything she holds dear. Her questioning helped me question all my relatiionships--with family members, friends, significant others, my church, and my job. It's very much the kind of novel I want to pass on to a friend.

I was somewhat baffled and unimpressed by THE CHILD BUYER (1960) when it was assigned to me in high school and never bothered to read another thing by John Hersey. I bought KEY WEST TALES because (a) I had recently been to Key West, and (b) being a collection of short stories, I knew I could jump to another story if I didn't like the one I was reading.This collection of stories, more than anything, reminded me of Sherwood Anderson's WINESBURG, OHIO. I have become distrustful of fiction writers who load up their characters with endearing (or annoying) idiosyncrasies in order to make them more memorable (as much as I enjoyed Berendt's MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, I suspect he indulged in this vice a bit). Like the citizens of Winesburg, Ohio, Hersey's Key West natives are believable people experiencing a plausible share of dissonance with the world they seem trapped in. The result is often poignant, as in "The Two Lives of Consuela Castanon," the story of an obese young receptionist who resists, then acquiesces to the advances of a handsome young man not from Key West. In fact, Hersey comes close to replicating the eeriness and desperation of Shirley Jackson's "The Daemon Lover." The best crafted story in the collection is "Fantasy Fest," a story about a woman who has been contacted by the son she had put up for adoption when he was an infant. In his letter to her he suggests that they each dress up as "their own particular fantasy" about themselves and join in Key West's Halloween parade. He is confident that using this ploy they will both be naturally drawn to one another. Does it work? Do they meet? I wouldn't dream of spoiling the story for you. The longest story in the collection, "Get Up, Sweet Slug-a-bed," is the story of a gay man dying of AIDS and of the people in his life. This is no TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. The relationships are complex and unsentimental. Like Anderson, Hersey does not people his world with saintly or purely wicked folk. It's a fallen world, for sure, one peopled with sinners, many of whom act with the best intentions.Intercut with the short stories are fictionalized glimpses of Key West's history and legends. Neither Hersey, his widow, nor his editor reveals the publication history of the pieces that make up this collection, but I suspect the "historical" pieces were items Hersey wrote for the local newspaper. Taken together, they give the reader a sense of place. Key West is more that the southernmost town in the United States, a tourist destination, or a gay haven. It's a place with a history, a place that has always honored independent thinking. The historical vignettes bring more than color to this collection, they provide its spine.This collection is Hersey's swan song...and he sings it well.

This book is the fruit of a &quot;learning partnership&quot; between Professor Lawrence Kushner and playwright David Mamet. Each man reflects independently on a brief reading from the Torah which they have studied together. This is not a call-and-response presentation. On some lessons, the men make similar observations. More often, however, they seem to approach the exact same texts from wildly different perspectives. If you're the kind of person who believes the Bible is a vital, living, ever-transforming thing, this is profoundly encouraging. The Bible is as fresh as the minds that open themselves to it. They are a deep well; it is impossible to drain these sacred texts dry.The cities of refuge in the book of Numbers were those cities where people suspected of violent crimes could flee to be protected from the blood vengeance of the family and clan members of one's victims. The citizens of these towns guaranteed your safety until your case could be carefully deliberated by wiser and cooler heads. According to Numbers, there were to be six of these cities within the territory of Israel. For the authors, the five &quot;cities&quot; of refuge are the five books of the Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). In these five masterworks, students can experience the patience and loving kindness of the Creator while reflecting on their blessings, mistakes, desires, and shortcomings. Safety, the authors seem to be saying, is a necessary prerequisite to exploring the fullness of God's mind and human potential. As Mamet says in his final contribution to this volume, &quot;The 'struggle with the angel,' Judaism's struggle, is this: not that we will wrest more information from him--we will not--but that we learn to live with the information we possess--to cease seeking information and to pursue wisdom.&quot;Some readers may find these devotions to be too slight (most are only one page long), but I found a slow careful reading of a single biblical text and Kushner's and Mamet's reflections on that text to be a great way to start the day. They are short enough to commit to, deep enough to enrich one's entire day.

This DVD is worth every cent of its price if you were to only purchase it for the three cantatas that are performed here in their entirety. The &quot;gimmick&quot; of Sir John Eliot Gardiner's pilgrimage tour was to perform every one of Bach's surviving cantatas (some 200 of the 500-plus composed) on the Sunday or church fesitval for which it was composed, and in a sacred setting (often a church where Bach himself had performed it). The three cantatas performed here (Nos. 179, 199, and 113) were written for the Eleventh Sunday after Trinity, a Sunday that seems given to reflection on the typically Lutheran theme of Christian sin and inadequacy (Gardiner wisely concludes the program with No. 113, the cheeriest of the three). Performed at St. David's in Wales, the cathedral's beautifully rugged interior provides a visually appealing and accoustically perfect setting for Bach's music. Watching the soloists made me aware of just how dramatic a form the cantata is in Bach's hands. Czech soprano Magdalena Kozena's face is especially expressive. She is totally connected to her text and music; there is no coy raising of the eyebrows or pointless tilting of the head that flaw the performances of many opera divas and singers of art song. This is a music with a purpose, and its message is delivered faithfully, forcibly, and clearly. Although every soloist in this concert is wonderful, I was especially fascinated by William Towers. I have never heard a male alto before and enjoyed the rich and grounded quality of Towers's voice (something I find lacking in countertenors). If, after watching this performance, you agree with me that it is awe-inspiring, you can buy the audio CD as well (Universal Music Co., Archiv Production: 463 591-2).The Pilgrimage documentary was difficult to loacate on the DVD. But DO make the effort to find it. Watching it, you'll gain an appreciation of the magnitude of the project (mission, really) that the Montiverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists committed themselves to--to perform all the Cantatas (67 concerts in total) throughout Europe and concluding with a Christmas concert in New York City during the millennial year. Even the artists interviewed who don't identify themselves as Christians describe the concert tour as a profound religious and spiritual experience. If you like this documentary, you'll also enjoy Image Entertainment's DVD &quot;In Rehearsal with John Eliot Gardiner,&quot; a taping of Gardiner's rehearsal session for Cantata No. 63, also from the 2000 Pilgrimage Year.The DVD comes with an attractive 30-page booklet (English/French/German) of essays and librettos. Another nice touch is the on-screen captions; you never have to look away to figure out what is being said.

I could never make myself buy the DVD of Larry Clark's "Kids". While I thought it was a powerful story filmed in an interesting (if virtually pornographic) style, I couldn't shake the feeling that the actors were somehow being exploited. Also, it was disturbing to watch so many directionless teens make a mess of their lives.But "Bully" is a different matter. Though based on Jim Shutze's "novel", it is the retelling of the real murder of a Florida youth who was brutally stabbed and bludgeoned by his own "friends." As with "Kids", Clark is intent upon making sure the teens his actors portray embody the loopy logic and emotional terrain (deadpan or wistful one minute, hysterical the next)of contemporary kids--in this case suburbanites being raised by clueless parents who seem to be willfully naive about what their kids can and will do. Half of the murderers had no special grudge against the victim, the "bully" of the film's title, a fact that seems especially chilling. Although you can't accuse Clark of hiding the grisly nature of what transpired, he seems as fascinated by the "planning" of the murder as by the act itself. One painful aspect of watching this film is that Clark makes us accutely aware that there were ample opportunities for the events to have unfolded otherwise. What if, for instance, even one of the youths involved had chickened out, or had reported the plot to the police? What if the professional hitman the teens consulted (Leo Fitzpatrick from "Kids") acted on his hunch that these kids didn't know what they were doing and successfully talked them out of it? Throughout the film Clark manages to keep us in the moment by leaving the underlying issue of justice unexplored. Did Bobby (played to perfection by Nich Stahl), who had dominated and abused his best friend Marty (Brad Renfro) since childhood, deserve to die? Clearly the jury saw no extenuating circumstances in this crime; but do we? Couldn't the arguments that are made in murders committed after years of spousal abuse have been made on Marty's behalf? (The homoerotic and psychosexual tensions that ricochet throughout this film seem to support, for me anyway, the argument that Marty WAS an abused spouse and deserving of some legal consideration.)The DVD has no director's commentary, but does have extensive "Cast & Crew" interviews (if nothing else, it's comforting to see the actors speaking like thoughtful, articulate young people with real consciences and a genuine connection to life.) Be sure to catch what they have to say about how they landed their roles.

What I found most touching about INTO THE WILD was the care with which Krakauer explored the life story of his subject, Chris McCandless, a young man who chose to live an unconventional life after graduating college by venturing into the Alaskan wilderness and attempting to live on only what he found there. In Krakauer's hands, McCandless is neither a victim nor a foolhardy adventurer. In the end, McCandless is depicted as a human being, like you or me, who has made his own choices; some gave him great joy, others brought about his demise. I also liked the way Krakauer compared McCandless's experiences with that of others in American history who attempted to interface directly with Nature. And I liked that Krakauer vulnerably employed his own experience of undertaking a difficult solo climb up a treacherous Alaskan mountain as a way of helping the reader better understand how relatively normal people come to take on such risks. This is not cold or clever reportage, but a compassionate account of one young man's all-too-brief journey through this world. Oddly, I found this to be a very spiritual book.

This little volume contains Annie Proulx's original short story version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as it appeared in The New Yorker in 1997 along with the screenplay to Ang Lee's film by Larry McMurtry (The Last Picture Show, Terms of Endearment) and Diana Ossana. The screenwriters retained much of the spareness, tension, and overt and threatened violence of the original story. They even incorporate much of Proulx's unfilmable descriptions in between the characters' speeches (perhaps as cues for method actors). The biggest change from story to screen seems to be the expanded roles of the women in the men's lives--the wives, girlfriends (created from whole cloth), and Ennis's daughter, Alma Jr. This seems justified, given that the story takes place over twenty years, a period in which both main characters, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, carried out a spotty love affair but constructed their public lives according to more conventional mores. Ennis's love of his daughters is, we feel, genuine and not a substitution or consolation prize. And the fact that she can see her father's loneliness only adds to the pathos of his situation.Each writer contributes an essay about their experience bringing this story to the big screen. Proulx's "Getting Movied" was especially thoughtful and generous. The volume would have been nicely served, however, had Ang Lee contributed an Introduction. If you're a movie credits geek, this book concludes with the entire closing credits, including the sheep wrangler and bear trainer. Also includes 8 pages of black and white photos from the film.A nice souvenir for anyone who loves the movie and wants to study it more closely.

I recently finished reading Martin Amis's EXPERIENCE: A MEMOIR in which he cites Saul Bellow as a literary father figure (moreso, it seems, than his own author father Kingsley Amis). This made me want to read something by Bellow and since SEIZE THE DAY is a short novel (114 pages) from his peak period I chose to read this book first. Cynthia Ozick's introductory essay was not a very helpful introduction to the book. She quotes heavily from the novel, which is a bit of a spoiler. Perhaps it would have been better to read her essay after reading the novel.First published in 1956, the novel is about a middle-aged man in New York City who is separated from his wife (and sons) and living in a residential hotel, the Gloriana, the same hotel where his father keeps a separate apartment. I appreciated this book as a portrait of a middle-aged, middle class white male in mid-twentieth century America. One feels both sympathy for and frustration with the main character, Tommy Wilhelm. He's intelligent and well-meaning, but also weak and easily swayed by others' opinion of him and what he needs to do to become a "success." A failed Hollywood actor, he seems startled to learn, like Willie Loman, that personal attractiveness is not always enough to ensure success. His disappointment in himself is echoed by his own father, Dr. Adler, who is unwilling to give him words of encouragement (or the much-needed financial aid his son seeks). But his birth father is not the only father figure in his life to betray or disappoint him. There was also Maurice Venice, the sleazy agent who encouraged Wilhelm to drop out of college to pursue a career in pictures. And then, in the present day of the story (the entire novel unfolds in a single day like the much longer ULYSSES) there is Dr. Tamkin, a dubiously credentialed psychiatrist, who lures Wilhelm to invest in lard in the Chicago commodities market, precipitating the primary crisis of the novel. Against this tortured backdrop is the story of Wilhelm's own efforts to remain a visible and active part in his own sons' lives while trying to initiate a divorce from their mother. While some readers may perceive the depiction of the "blood-sucking" Margaret as misogynistic, Bellow's depiction of this failed relationship seems authentic, especially for the era he was writing about. Fathers' rights were few and women, even separated and divorced women, were expected to stay at home and take care of their children. And in the end, SEIZE THE DAY is a novel without either untarnished heroes or blameless victims. Even disappointing father figures can speak profound truths, as Dr. Tamkin does when he tells Wilhelm, "Don't marry suffering. Some people do. They get married to it, and sleep and eat together, just as husband and wife. If they go with joy they think it's adultery." In SEIZE THE DAY Bellow has given us a powerful meditation on what it means to pursue the soul's deepest desires and to mourn the many deaths and losses even the most optimistic among us is bound to encounter living out the life they've been given.

The key events in THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE take place in Scotland in the unsettled time between the two World Wars. In a number of ways, the title character, a school mistress in an Edinburgh girls school, is a lot like two world figures she admits to admiring: Mussolini and Hitler. While being arbitrary and authoritarian herself, she exhibits contempt for all legitimate authority. While claiming to educate her students in the true sense of the word (i.e., to draw them out), she constantly labels and confines them by her preconceptions of what she believes their destinies to be. She also manipulates their trust, inappropriately shares adult information with them, and constantly tests their loyalty. Brodie's set, as the girls are referred to by the headmistress and other "outsiders", are a privileged elite, the creme de la creme. And privilege comes with both responsibilities and risks. Spark gives a subtle reading of what it means to bask in the not-always-healthy favor of an all-too-human leader. While the novel sometimes seems to be told from the point of view of one of Brodie's students (the second half seems to belong almost entirely to Sandy, the girl with piggish eyes who becomes a nun and author of a bestselling book of psychology called "The Transfiguration of the Commonplace"), it is really told by an omniscient narrator, one capable of bridging time and making judgments no individual character with a limited perspective could ever make. It leaves the reader feeling that there just might be a power greater than the most naive victim or the most desperate, self-serving bully. This is truly a deep and disturbing book, one that should not be approached lightly or taken at face value.

And make no mistake, skinny it is! A mere 66 pages. This pamphlet is directed primarily to music directors and singers. I am neither, have no musical training, and cannot read music (so subtract 11 pages of coloratura exercises...which reduces it to only 55 pages of actual text).Since my church performs Bach cantatas frequently, I was looking for something that could give me a little background information on Bach and the musical forms he chose to work in. This book doesn't really provide that, but the carefully compiled Annotated Bibliography (of mostly English works) lists a number of titles that seem quite promising. Since I am primarily interested in Bach's choral works from the perspective of how they fit into the liturgy, I found Father Martin Shannon's chapter &quot;Soli Deo Gloria&quot; to be the most rewarding. That chapter alone was worth the price of the book.

This book by the author of "Home: A Short History of an Idea" (1986) is a more subjective and less disciplined examination of that same topic. Professor Rybczynski uses his experience as an immigrant trying to "fit in" as a lens for looking at what in means to build ones own home. The skeleton of this story is the author's own decision to build a shed to which he can retreat on weekends (for more on weekends, read the author's "Waiting for the Weekend," 1991) and build a boat he can sail away in. At some point the shed becomes more of a barn and then, when he finally abandons his plan to build a boat, it becomes a permanent home for himself and his wife. For me, the book is less about architecture, the act or craft of building, and more about morphing and the undpredictable ways life unfolds. Taken in that vein, Rybczynski's story can be appreciated as a spiritual journey with many sidetrips and gentle awakenings. He is self-critical, but not self-deprecating. And he infuses his tale with enough humor to keep the reader interested without taxing credibility. I especially enjoyed his description of his wife, Shirley, who does some morphing of her own. At the beginning (when the couple was building a mere boathouse), she is little more than an extra pair of hands; when the couple decides to make the structure they have been building into their home, Shirley suddenly becomes a full-fledged "client," full of opinions and demands.Although, Rybczynski describes several impressive architect conceived and built houses (such as Wright's Fallingwater and Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth house), it is the houses built by their owners that he most celebrates--Mark Twain's home in Hartford, Connecticutt, Sir Walter Scott's Abbotsford, Robert Lewis Stevenson's Vailima in Samoa, artists Carl and Karin Larsson's much documented Lilla Hyttnas in Sundborn, Sweden, and Carl Jung's home in Bollingen, Switzerland. "It is no coincidence," writes Rybczynski, "that Stevenson, Scott, Clemens, Larsson, Castrejon, and I were less than forty years old when we built our homes.... The process of building, for all of us, was a process of installing ourselves in a place, of establishing a spot where it would be safe to dream. We had to be old enough to recognize the particularity--and limits--of our dreams, but not too old to believe in them....My house had begun with the dream of a boat. The dream had run aground--I was now rooted in place." (pp. 190, 193)

At long last, Mart Crowley's "The Boys in the Band" is available on DVD (I can finally discard the VHS tape I have held onto for so long fearing it would warp or degrade over time). The play the film was based on was penned just over forty years ago, and the film was released thirty-eight years ago. Because the camera work, direction, and acting are so contemporary in feeling the film sometimes feels like it was made yesterday. But then, as I was watching it and enjoying it, I realized that when I saw the movie when it first came out I was about half the age of most the characters; now I'm twice their age!The film is remarkable on a number of levels. First, this story about a group of gay men was brought to the stage just a year before the Stonewall riots in New York, when the gay community led by its most frequently maligned subgroup (the drag queens) openly rebelled against police harassment, a rebellion that ushered in the gay liberation movement. Most large cities today have Gay Pride parades and celebrations in late June marking this historical event. Even with backlash from the religious right, Western society in general has continued to move in an increasingly tolerant direction. So it may be hard for younger people, or indeed, for anyone who has come of age since Stonewall, to identify or accept the level of paranoia, bitterness, and self-loathing the characters in this film sometimes display. But, allowing for the theatrical device of exageration, these characterization reflect a reality that existed. And, as anyone who came of age prior to Stonewall can attest, Crowley does a good job of capturing the compensating loyalty and humor upon which gay men (the film, alas, only tells the male side of the pre-Stonewall era) relied for coping in a hostile world. After Stonewall there was a period when "Boys in the Band" fell out of favor and was unjustly accused of perpetuating stereotypes. (Crowley himself has gone on record as apologizing for the play's depiction of the self-loathing homosexual. In the featurettes included on the DVD,however, he seems to have moved beyond his earlier embarrassment and is again taking pride in his materpiece.)Another thing that makes this film remarkable is that the producers refused to replace the original off-Broadway cast with big name Hollywood stars. Also, director William Friedkin resisted the temptation to "open up" the play for the screen. (Anyone who has seen both the brilliant off-Broadway stage production of "Steel Magnolias" and the banal film version should give a big "thank you!" for this.) Without statically filming a staged production of the play (and by taking full advantange of the skills of DP Arthur Ornitz), Friedkin was able to exploit the claustrophobia and building tension of nine people trapped in the birthday party from hell. (In fact, the only scenes shot outside of host's apartment are the character-establishing shots of each of the party guests leaving his adaptive environment in New York City and making his way to the party. These accompany the opening credits and are a luscious and all-too-brief reminder of what New York was like in the good old days.)The film has also been criticized for being too vicious, with the characters being much too hell-bent on tearing one another down. But to these critics I would respond that "Boys in the Band" is a late example of a well-established trend in 1960s theater (consider, for example, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" and "The Lion in Winter"). This mean-spiritedness is the shadow side of the much-touted American optimism and I think it has as much to do with the American culture's emergence from the buttoned-down 1950s as with anything specifically attributable to closeted gays. It wasn't just gay men who were learning (albeit imperfectly and ineptly) to express themselves in the 1960s--it was everybody. This mean-spiritedness has its roots in post-WWII playwrights Miller and Williams and its successors in Shepherd and Mamet. Its causes and effects are clearly something worth depicting and thinking about.The DVD includes three excellent featurettes (Act One: The Play; Act Two: The Film; Act Three: 40 Years of Boys in the Band) which include interviews with Crowley and Friedkin as well as the two surviving members of the cast (Laurence Luckinbill and Peter White). The director's and screenwriter's commentary is a little less gratifying (both Friedkin and Crowley speak at length on a number of interesting issues, much of which was also used to create the featurettes and consequently not new information after you've watched the featurettes. Also, Friedkin's and Crowley's comments come from separate interviews so there is no interaction between these two men who obviously respected each other and enjoyed working together. Crowley's comments on Natalie Wood's support and friendship were especially interesting and worth hearing.) But all in all, the DVD producers have done an excellent job of packaging and presenting a groundbreaking and compelling work.

Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a true sociopath and Malkovich plays him chillingly. Although I had trouble understanding the basic scam that seems to be driving the plot of this movie, I have a hunch it is not really significant anyway. The movie seems to be primarily a metaphor for modern (postmodern?) life and the seduction of an honest (but weak and dying) man by evil. Dougray Scott plays the "innocent" party. His moral struggle and agony is constantly displayed on his face. It is hard to imagine how he as an actor could produce all this intense emotion when he is getting nothing but deadpan understatement from Malkovich. But their partnership on the screen is truly eerie. And the stony coldness of the Berlin setting (with its unforgetable associations with nazi evil) only adds to the general atmosphere of creepiness. Although I don't know if his line comes from Highsmith's novel, it does seem consistent with the existential aura in which she casts her killers to have Scott's character (at his most distraught) ask Ripley, "Why me? Why did you choose me?" Ripley's answer would have done Camus proud.It's hard to picture Malkovich as the elder version of Matt Damon's Ripley (from The Talented Mr. Ripley). There is no sense of Ripley as the romantically disappointed lost soul committing murders in spite of his earnest desire to be socially accepted. Malkovich "thrives" socially--has a wife (or lover), and even enjoys harpsicord music. It's just not clear what he "gets" from all his success. That, to me, is the definition of a sociopath.DVD extras can only be accessed via computer/internet.

Somehow, I managed to get through high school and college without ever seriously reading any of the great Western philosophers. The Consolations of Philosophy is an excellent introduction and quick (I mean,QUICK) overview of six of these men. The deadwhitemales discussed are Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. The discussion is lively and thought-provoking--and amusingly illustrated. This book would serve as an excellent secondary text for an introduction to philosophy course. Even the most jaded undergraduate will want to learn more about the teachings of the philosophers covered. I found the chapters on Seneca (&quot;Consolation for Frustration&quot;), Montaigne (&quot;Consolation for Inadequacy&quot;), and Nietzsche (&quot;Consolation for Difficulties&quot;) the most engaging and challenging. De Botton's writing and thinking are fresh and remind me, for some reason, of the cultural essays of Susan Bordo (and Camille Paglia in her more reasonable moments).

The Library of America (LOA) has done a wonderful job of publishing all of Faulkner's novels in five compact, uniform editions. Besides being handsome, beautifully typeset volumes, they contain the texts of one America's most brilliant authors in versions that are as authoritative as can reasonably be expected. All five volumes were edited by two of the foremost Faulkner scholars--Noel Polk and Joseph Blotner; and each volume contains their notes on the text and a detailed chronology of Faulkner's life (In case you ever find yourself wondering when Faulkner entered first grade, the year was 1905; he enjoyed drawing and painting.) The scholarship and care that went into the preparation of the LOA Faulkner is impeccable.Within the LOA series, the novels are arranged chronologically (though the volumes were not released in sequence). Consequently, the present volume contains the last two novels (The Town and The Mansion) in Faulkner's great trilogy, The Snopes. To get the first (and critically proabably the best) novel in the trilogy, The ;Hamlet, you'll have to purchase William Faulkner: Novels 1936-1940 (ISBN 0-940450-55-0). Since that volume also includes Faulkner's masterpiece Absalom! Absalom!, it is worth the purchase price. In my opinion, it is impossible to overpraise The Snopes trilogy, and it is difficult to summarize its themes. Suffice it to say, the trilogy encompasses many genres (myth, folklore, legend, realism, epic) while provideing an insightful and scathing commentary on the American dream, society, and the tension between traditional values and modernity. (Faulkner's insights make Theodore Dreiser look like an entertainment Tonight! reporter.) Although The Town has been called a "weak plank between two substantial boulders," I have to confess a fondness for its depiction of the goofy and sexually naive town lawyer, Gavin Stevens (also the hero of Faulkner's Knight's Gambit short stories). I would also venture to say that readers' uncomfortability with The Town may also be a reflection of the fact that this part of the trilogy represents the "real world of the present"--not our mythic past which we nostalgically recast to flatter our self-image (The Hamlet), nor an expression of our "wildest dreams," what we expect our life to be like "when our ship comes in" (The Mansion). Most of life, in other words, is taken up not with valiant struggles and bold accomplishments, but with the pettiness of domestic life and trying to get along with others. The Town (published in 1957), therefore, can be seen as the flip side of Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and all the other 1950s family sitcoms. Taken in that vein, I think it's a good satire and a delectable opera bouffe between two grand operas.Daniel J. Singal in William Faulkner: The Making of a Modernist (1997; Univeristy of North Carolina Press) pinpoints November 1940 as the date when Faulkner's genius and talent began to irreversibly fade. While on a camping trip Faulkner, always a heavy drinker and surely already an alcoholic for many years, suffered brain damage when he passed out while drinking. If this is true, that means all three novels collected in Novels 1957-1962 were written during the Nobel laureate's waning years. Concerning the many passages of brilliant writing in The Mansion, Singal notes that many of these had been previously published as short stories and only reworked to become part of the novel. It is hard to imagine how The Mansion could have been better (though I'm sure there is no shortage of Faulkner scholars willing to suggest some scenarios). As far as The Reivers goes, I have long recommended this novel to friends who want to read something by Faulkner but are intimidated by the structural challenges of The Sound and the Fury or Absalom! Absalom! The Reivers is a nostalgic look at the early days of Jefferson (the key town in Faulkner's invented Yoknapatawpha County) told mostly through the eyes of a young boy. The story is linear and easy to follow, and the humor is some of Faulkner's funniest and most heart-warming. If this is Faulkner at his most diminished, most American novelists writing today should be so diminished!So buy both Novels 1936-1940 and Novels 1957-1962 and treat yourself to The Snopes trilogy. Then, after you've finished it, rent "The Long Hot Summer" and see what a mangle Hollywood made of Faulkner's richly imagined world.

This is an odd little book. The events take place in a single afternoon at the home of an American woman in France between the First and Second World Wars. The narrator, Alwyn Tower, and his hostess, Alexandra Henry, are visited by the Cullens, a middle-aged Irish couple. Mrs. Cullen has brought along her pet hawk Lucy whose presence dominates the remainder of the story (both symbolically and as another character). With its hood on, the hawk seems to represent the blindness of a class of wealthy internationals who live for food and fun, and who have made an uneasy peace with their captivity and lack of freedom.Meanwhile, a trio of servants (Jean and Eva, the cooks; and Ricketts, the Cullens' chauffeur) plays yang to the aristocats' yin. For them, flirtation, jealousy, and passion are the defining mainstays of their existence. And they don't even need to turn to alcohol to release these life forces.It's hard to know how seriously we are to take the narrator, a novelist twice failed in love. He is an astute observer and chronicler of the events, but his self-acknowledged failures as a writer certainly seem to justify the uncomfortable feelings he has toward Mrs. Cullen's captive carnivore. Although we know from page one that the Americans Alexandra and Alwyn would eventually return to America when tensions increase in Europe, at the novel's end it seems somewhat doubtful that either one will ever muster the energy needed to leave their perches in Alexandra's parlor.This short novel has some of the biting class insights of Saki's better stories. Other than that, I find it hard to compare this book to any other I have ever read. Interesting in spite of and because of its brevity. Worth reading and rereading.

A few things come off very nicely in Kermode's &quot;The Age of Shakespeare.&quot; What it lacks in detailed analysis of Shakespeare's poetry and dramaturgy, it makes up for by providing a sense of Shakespeare's time, the growth of theater in the 16th and 17th centuries (thanks, in part, to Mr. Shakespeare himself), and the many ways Shakespeare adapted his craft to suit evolving sensibilities. For the first time I appreciated Shakespeare as a business-person who used everything at his disposal in order to succeed at his chosen profession (or, at least, the one he ended up practicing after failing to find reliable patronage as a professional poet).It is apt that this book is part of Modern Libary's Chronicle Book series, as chronolgoy is key here. Although scholars don't always know the exact sequence in which the plays were written, there seems to be enough of a consensus that Kermode can make some useful observations and generalizations. For instance, plays that were written for the Globe, a large outdoor theater, are different in some noticeable ways from the late Romance plays produced for the more intimate setting of the Blackfriars theater (with its higher-priced tickets that necessarily excluded groundlings). Such claims, of course, need to be tested by a careful rereading of the plays--in chronilogical order, rather than by genre or broad categories.One warning, there are no plot summaries here. You pretty much need to be familiar with Shakespeare's plays in order to follow Kermode's arguments.The book includes a brief &quot;Bibliographical Note&quot; to direct readers to other reliable resources on various aspects of life, religion, art, and theater in Shakespeare's time.

The text of this very readable, no-nonsense, high-level view of all the key philosophies and religions that competed with Judaism and Christianity at the beginning of the Common Era runs to a mere 149 pages. I liked that Tripolitis reduced matters to the mere essentials. I've struggled with the articles in the Anchor Bible Dictionary on many of these religions and have found them difficult to follow and perplexing...and they never seem to give one a sense of how dominant any of them were during their time. Tripolitis provides ample footnotes and a bibliography for the skeptics who want to challenge her generalizations (of which there are many) if they find them too sweeping. One I might want to follow up on myself is her statement that the concept of the individual began in the era she covers (roughly from 331 B.C.E. to the 4th century C.E.). She attributes the success of mystery religions and religions promising personal salvation to this rise of individualism.Tripolitis covers the great mystery cults (Demeter, Dionysus, Isis, and Cybele), religious philosophies (Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Middle Platonism), Mithraism, Hellenistic Judaism, Christianity, and Gnosticism (both the Christian and non-Christian forms). I appreciated that Tripolitis acknowledges when information is lacking (as with the mystery cults) and that she resists the temptation to fill in the gaps with speculative psychology. Similarly, she is careful not to try to identify clear relationships between the many different Gnostic sects that emerged in the 2nd century C.E. The ultimate and lasting success of Christianity she attributes to more than just Constantine's favor. It succeeded, she asserts, because of its universalism, ecclesiastical organization, standardized canon of Scripture, and credal formulas. In sum, this is a handy book that you'll want to keep near by as you wrestle with weightier and more opinionated tomes.

Sherill Tippins has done an amazing job of finding the significant narrative threads in the chaotic convergence of creative lives that occurred in the months before Pearl Harbor when Harper's Bazaar editor George Davis and British expatriate poet W.H. Auden rented a brownstone on 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn Heights and actively recruited other creative artists to live with them. Among the co-renters were Carson McCullers who had recently published her highly acclaimed first novel, "The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter," soon-to-be famous British composer Benjamin Britten and his parnter, singer Peter Pears, unpublished novelists Paul and Jane Bowles, Broadway set designer Oliver Smith, writer Richard Wright and his wife, and burlesque sensation Gypsy Rose Lee, who it turns out was the most reliable in the rent-paying department and joined the little "creative commune" on the condition that she could bring her own cook and maid. Her fiscal reliability and drive along with Auden's willingness to take on the unpleasant role of house disciplinarian (collecting rent and other "dues" and establishing and enforcing many house rules) are probably sufficient explanation for why this menage managed to last the two or three years it did.Tippins wisely focuses her attention on the leading figures (without neglecting to name the many others who partied but did not reside at 7 Middagh--Salvador and Gala Dali, Lincoln Kirstein, George Balanchine, Erika Mann and her brothers Klaus and Golo, to name a few). One passer-through, Anais Nin, christened the dwelling "February House" because so many of the residents had February birthdays. Tippins has a good knowledge of the works of these creative people and is able to see how one of the artists intentionally or inadvertantly influenced a subsequent work of one of his or her co-residents. For example, McCullers was struggling with the novel that would later become "The Member of the Wedding" when she was able to appropriate an experience from Chester Kallman's childhood to explain her heroine's profound sense of alienation and abandonment (Kallman was Auden's lover).Tippins other great achievement here was her ability to slice through history and palpably recreate the political atmosphere in pre-war New York and to do so in a way that reflects on both British and US perspectives. She takes a good hard look at the criticism expatriates like Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Britten, and Pears faced from the British press and fellow artists who chose to remain in Great Britian during the war. She is similarly insightful in her analysis of the role the Mann family had in trying to get an apathetic America to respond to the European crisis. A lesser writer might not have bothered with these issues and chosen to report only the salacious and saleable anecdotes about the goings-on of the February House residents.I highly recommend this book to anyone even passingly interested in one of the artists who lived at 7 Middagh Street (you're sure to learn something new), to anyone who ever wondered how great works of art come about, or to anyone interested in knowing how history and art intersect. I'm sure I'm going to use Tippins's Selecte Bibliography as a basis for future Amazon.com purchases.

I've always been a fan of the Good News Bible, a modern English translation that is easy to understand but which, unlike some modern translations, also employs dignified religious language to communicate its important message. Especially nice from a Roman Catholic perspective, this translation bears an Imprimatur. The Imprimatur is basically a green light from the Catholic heirarchy (in this case from the Most Rev. William H. Keeler, DD) saying that the text is acceptable for Catholics to read. This is a peace-of-mind factor that should help make Catholic parents and teachers feel comfortable sharing this translation with the young people in their care. Also comforting is the fact that this "Catholic edition" of the Good News Translation includes ALL of the books that constitute the biblical canon for Catholics, not just the 66 books that Protestants consider to be Scripture. This means young people can read about the piety of people from the "intertestamental" period, heroes and heroines of the faith like Tobit, Tobias, Sarah, Judith, Judas Maccabees and his brothers, and Susanna. They can also access the rich wisdom of the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach (Ecclesiasticus). This edition of the Good News Bible includes the many charming and timeless line drawing illustrations of the Swiss artist Annie Vallotton that have been a part of most editions of this translation ever since the New Testament was first published in 1966.In addition to the great translation, the Break Through! Bible has many helpful features designed to help young people engage with the biblical stories and teachings: introductions to every book of the Bible (with Headlines and Factoids that call readers' attention to key themes and interesting information); "Live It!", "Study It!", and "Pray It!" text boxes that help young people apply the Bible's lessons to their own lives; "Catholic Connections" text boxes that help readers understand Church doctrine and liturgical practices in light of the Bible; full-color "tip-in" pages with illustrated profiles of Bible characters whose faith choices make them ideal role models for young people living in challenging times and vulnerable to being "seduced" by less pious pop culture icons. This Bible also includes a "Salvation History Timeline," Bible reading plans, a "Where to Find It?" guide to famous Bible passages, suggested readings for Special Occasions, a Word List, a list of the Three-Year Cycle lectionary readings, and color maps.What's also amazing, this Bible is set in easy-to-read type and is very compact considering how much is packed between its covers. This will fit nicely into a young person's bookbag or backpack. St. Mary's Press has done a wonderful job all around! Buy it! Share it! Read it! Study it! Pray it! Live it!

Dava Sobel is a natural-born storyteller. She has given herself a huge topic to cover (the discovery of a way of establishing longitude at sea, the endowment and administration of a Longitude Prize, and the pursuit of that prize by various people in the 17th and 18th centuries); she has deftly described the scientific issues that make the problem seemingly impossible to solve; and she vividly brings to life the many key figures who had a hand in how the discovery eventually played out--the good, the bad, and the petty. I think it is Sobel's unjaundiced eye, her ability to examine human nature clearly and without apology that makes this book so appealing. Time and again I found myself saying, "Notthing has changed. People are still like that!" Human beings continue to be motivated by greed, ego, and envy. We continue to bend rules when it suits our need and we continue to sabotage the best efforts of others. The 18th century practice of slandering one's professional foes in pamphlets certainly has its equivalents in blog-smears. Character assasination seems to be one of humanity's most abiding pastimes. But in the end, Sobel's story is one of human ingenuity, personal sacrifice, and total commitment. In this instance at least, the good guy wins. And with Sobel's popular account of John Harrision, the inventor of the first successful chronometer, she manages to drag this obscure inventor's name out of anonymity and give him the recognition he clearly deserves. "With his marine clocks, John Harrision tested the waters of space-time. He succeeded, against all odds, in using the fourth--temporal--dimension to link points on the three-dimensional globe. He wrested the world's whereabouts from the stars, and locked the secret in a pocket watch."There is an edition of LONGITUDE that includes many illustrations. I've seen it in stores and can vouch for its quality. But Sobel's writing is so visual and impactful that I would recommend choosing the edition without picutures. Let your imagination do the work. This is a great read.

Rob Fleming, the "hero" of HIGH FIDELITY runs Championship Vinyl, a used record shop on a sidestreet in London (and I mean records...though there is much talk of compilation tapes and some evidence of CDs in this 1995 novel as well.) His girlfriend Laura has just walked out on him, prompting him to list his top five heartbreaks of all time. Compiliing lists of "top fives" (of anything, though mostly music-related things) is a very serious pastime for Rob and his equally adrift coworkers, both of whom are, believe it or not, worse at relationships with women than Rob. What follows is vintage Hornby--fast-pased storytelling, clever dialog (with women often outshining the men), and a real honest sense of the current zeitgeist for thirty-somethings. I only got about 40% of the musical references (the ones that go back to my era and tastes--Dusty Springfield, Aretha Franklin, the Beatles), but Hornby doesn't really include such references to tax the reader's memory, but rather to make statements about the characters who care so much about slight differences in taste. The abundant humor, however, doesn't deflect from the serious scrutiny Hornby lays to bear on the Rob & Laura's (Is this an ironic Dick Van Dyke Show reference?) relationship. In the end, Rob makes a compiliation tape for Laura, one that's "full of stuff she's heard of, and full of stuff she'd play." At last he is seeing her the way she is, not the way he thinks she should be. You can't help thinking, if you're at all romantic (or at least somewhat optimistic), that Rob and Laura just might make it. A fun read!

Nuland may have written one of the most poetic and philosophically sobering accounts of the process of dying. As a practicing physician, he is very much in command of his facts. He has a reverance for the human body and acknowledges the miracle of life. He also recognizes how those in his profession can be a hindrance for people at the end of life because everything in their background, make-up, and training makes them want to rescue dying people from their inevitable demise regardless of the pain and indignity their "solutions" might inflict on their patients. Nuland writes movingly of the end-of-life experiences of family members and patients. In HOW WE DIE he achieves a delicate balance of presenting facts and statistics in memorable ways while also sharing profound stories of loss and regret along with stories that offer hope that even the most gruesome of deaths can be meaningful experiences to the dying and their loved-ones. The chapters on specific illnesses (heart disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, AIDS) are worth re-reading before interacting with anyone suffering from these conditions.

I will defer to the judgment of other reviewers who have found fault with some of the "facts" Scotti relates in BASILICA. This is a popular, not an academic, history of the building of St. Peter's in Rome. I found Scotti's depiction of the sequence of events and of the personalities at play to be consistent with what I've read elsewhere. And she does a good job of demonstrating how all actions have a multiplicity of consequences--good and bad. If she's a little guilty of playing a "what if" game (What if the popes had not committed themselves to building the grandest church in Christendom and used the selling of indulgences to help finance it, and what if a certain Augustinian monk had found less combative ways to voice his concern about the shortcomings of his church, and what if New World civilizations hadn't been pillaged and destroyed to provide silver and gold for the church's ornament...), at least she conveys a clear sense that history is a complex and intertwined thing. Also, her descriptions of the popes, artists, and architects who had a hand in bringing about an amazing worship space that took generations to complete are pointed but unelaborated (she does no "The Agony and the Ecstasy"-type of filling in the unknowable details). Everything she asserts about them can likely be supported from letters and diary accounts (even if incorporated via secondary sources).My regret is that I read this book AFTER visiting the Vatican. I'm sure I would have had a more meaningful visit if I had read Scotti's history beforehand. And as lively as her writing is, most people could easily finish this 269-page book during a 9-hour trans-Atlantic flight. Perhaps Scotti's final sentence sums up one's mixed feelings about a building that cost the world so much: "Gothic cathedrals reach up to heaven. St. Peter's--muscular, sublime, irrevocable--brings heaven to earth."

Amazon has linked this book to the page for Penguin's edition of The Decameron translated by G.H. McWilliam. After careful shopping for the "right translation," I ended up purchasing McWilliams'. And the more I read it the happier I am with my choice. When I saw that the book was also available for my Kindle I impulsively downloaded it. WARNING: This is NOT the McWilliam's translation (it seems to be a very old, public domain text); nor does it include McWilliams' excellent and conprehensive introduction.My advice to Kindle customers: When buying classic literature in translation for downloading, always order a free sample first so you be sure it's the translation you want.

I never made it all the way through Randy Shilts's book so I won't presume to know whether this film did right by Mr. Shilts. Simply put, this is great drama. The patronizing statements about made-for-tv movies don't apply here. The drama, sadly, comes from the real events that are depicted--the collective denial about the reality of AIDS as that disease first began appearing in the gay and Haitian communities, the government's (read "Ronald Reagan's") persistent indifference, the professional jealousy within the medical communities vying to be the first to identify the agent (the virus) that causes AIDS, and how human beings resist having their preconceived notions about life challenged (as when a group of gay activists insists on keeping gay bath houses open even as it became apparent that AIDS was spread through sexual contact). This movie really took me back twenty years to when I first read a short article buried somewhere in the middle of the New York Times about a gay-related cancer little realizing how much my life would change from that point onward.The performances across the board are great. I was especially impressed by Matthew Modine (I've liked him since "Birdy" and I like to see him get meaty roles as here), Alan Alda (not the likable mensch from MASH), Ian McClellan, B.D. Wong, and Phil Collins (who knew?).Aside from some cast biographies this DVD has no other "extras". Nor does it need any.

I like that the viewer is never told precisely what the ONE thing is that this movie is about. (Nor do the writers, Karen and Jill Sprecher, give us any clues in the commentary they--and film editor Stephen Mirionne--provide for the DVD.) A number of themes, however, seem to nominate themselves for this position: Happiness, luck, the power of human will, guilt, acceptance of failure, cause and effect, human interconnectedness, and the value of small gestures, to name a few.The stories that make up this film are presented as a prologue followed by twelve distinct scenes (intertitled with names like, "Ignorance is bliss," "I once knew a happy man. His happiness was his curse," "Fortune smiles at some and laughs at others," and "18 inches of personal space." The filmmakers reveal a number of their sources in their commentary (John Stuart Mill and Soren Kierkegaard, for example), but I can't help thinking that their dominant influence were characters from the Bible and the history of the church. All of the Sprechers' characters fall somewhere on the continuum of faith and it is to their credit that they can take profound religious insights and graft them onto everyday human experiences without slipping into the easy sentimentality of religious-themed shows like "Touched by an Angel." Alan Arkin's insurance company manager seems to suffer Job-like as a divorced man with a heroin-addicted son who resists his father's help, while also taking on Satan/God-like qualities when he chooses to fire an employee simply because that employee is happy. ("I'm going to take away everything," he says. "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.") Clea Duvall, a young woman who works as a maid, has the quiet but certain faith of a modest saint. She has survived a couple of close calls with death (she even states at one point, "I was saved for a reason"), only to go into a deep depression and crisis of faith when she realizes that one of her clients, a young architect she had a crush on, believs she had stolen an expesive watch when cleaning his apartment. Matthew McConaughey is a cocky district attorney who takes pride in his ability to dispense justice, only to become aware of his own cowardice and guilt. His response is to fall into a swoon of self-mortification worthy of any of a number of medieval martyr saints. John Tuturro is a recently mugged, highly routinized college physics professor who has an adulterous affair with another professor. Athough he claims his mid-week dalliance is evidence that his life is not predictable, he tells his mistress to meet him again the following week at the same place and time. The richness of the performances given by these actors, as well as by the rest of the cast, go a long way to making the story unfold long after you finish watching the movie. This is a thoughtful story, well told.

Finally, this thrilling gala performance is available on DVD! The transfer is crisp and the dances are nicely indexed so you can jump to your favorites...not that you'll want to skip even one of them. But I'm sure every balletomane will have her or his favorite. Mine is "Remanso", a pas de trois for men based on a Garcia Lorca poem. Taped in 1998, these performances feature many of ABTs upcoming stars (Corella, Carreno, Herrera, Stiefel) as well as seasoned veterans (Jaffe, Bocca, Hill, McKerrow). Angel Corella delivers breath-taking turns in his pas de deux with Paloma Herrera from "Don Quixote."Although comprised of eight separate dance performances, each segment is intercut with fragments of backstage interviews with the dancers and artistic director Kevin McKenzie. Nothing momentous is revealed, but it's nice to hear the dancers express their enthusiasm for the works they perform and for the company that have the priviledge to dance for. Introduced by prima ballerina assoluta Natalia Makarava (looking great in a maroon silk and velvet gown by Gianfranco Ferre), it moves quickly and is the type of DVD you'll want to watch over and over. Far superior to ABTs other recent offering on DVD, "Le Corsaire," in which the dancers make fun of ballet (with justification) in between-the-acts interviews...and which is difficult to watch more than once.I never understand why "fine art" DVDs offer so few "extras" (in this case, none). If you go to a live performance of a ballet, you get program notes on the music and choreography and short biographies of each principal dancer. Is that so difficult to transfer to a bonus material section on a DVD? Are there copyright issues? Anyway, don't let the absence of extras deter you, this DVD really delivers the goods. Buy it, watch it, love it.

I enjoyed the wry, self-eviscerating essays in MAGICAL THINKING enough to be curious about their author, Augusten Burroughs. In MAGICAL THINKING Burroughs dropped a lot of clues about his dysfunctional childhood, drugs & alcohol problems, indifference to education, obsessions with pop culture (and especially beauty culture), inappropriate sex partners, and crazy mother. What's not to identify with? I was intrigued, and when I picked up RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, I was halfway expecting to see my own reflection. But, that wasn't my experience. Behind the humor (one person's defense mechanism is another's survival tool!), is a portrait of a lost childhood and a sense of alienation that make's Holden Caulfield's look like a bellyache. From MAGICAL THINKING I know that Burroughs's story has a reasonably happy ending. (If not a happy ending, at least that he was eventually able to make more than Tom Collinses from the lemons life gave him.) Burroughs went through a lot (including being legally relinquished by his mother to the care of her dubiously qualified psychiatrist at age 13). While living in the psychiatrist's household he becomes the underage lover of his adopted brother (twice his age) and manages with the enabling help of his "shrink father" to scam the school system into letting him quit school before the legal age of 16. Burroughs was the archetypal at-risk youth, and it says a lot about our society that children can so easily fall off the radar screen. Read RUNNING WITH SCISSORS for the laughs, or read it as biting social commentary--but read it.

I have never struggled less reading a modern literary novel. It was virtually a page-turner. Although I didn't identify with any of the main characters--the ficitionalized Virginia Woolf who we meet at the point in her career when she is writing MRS. DALLOWAY; Laura Brown, a young mother living in post-WWII America who makes lousy birthday cakes, harbors lesbian tendencies, and wishes only to stay in bed and read MRS. DALLOWAY all day; and Clarissa Vaughn, a present-day lesbian mother and editor who is the primary caregiver to a male poet dying from AIDS and whom the poets refers to as MRS. DALLOWAY--I didn't despise them either. The patient reader will discover that it is more than the fictional Mrs. Dalloway that connects the book's three protagonists whose lives span three generations, but to say more about this would undermine one of the book's few surprises.Cunningham's prose is flawless and narcotizing. Mercifully, he does not attempt to give us stream of consciousness writing. Observations and descriptions (even about things like flowers) are never decorative and gratuitous. Shifts in points of view are subtle, but always well signalled. The reader should never doubt that Cunningham is in control of his story. (If Cunningham is embodied in any one of his characters, I suspect it is the outward-oriented, ever-busy, and always in control Clarissa Vaughn.) What I find puzzling after finishing the book is how such a well-made book can be so emotionally unimpressive. Although the book culminates around a single dramatic event and the three separate strands of the narrative are drawn together, there doesn't seem to be much of a point. (The movie made from this novel seems to have stuggled with the same issue and responded by adding an improbable closing speech for an elderly Laura Brown.) Perhaps there is no point and Cunningham is making a coy play at being postmodern; or perhaps the point is that all of us--famous authors, disenchanted 50s housewives, or modern activist types--struggle with the same banal unraveling of the hours that make up our alotted time on earth. Karma is a big cosmic joke and our own pathetic lives are the punch line.Amusing detail: Meryl Streep who plays Clarissa Vaughn in the movie is mentioned in passing in an early chapter of the novel.

If you have a good ear and mind for decoding British working class accents (I don't), or a high tolerance for misunderstanding every fifth or sixth phrase (I have), you'll enjoy this film about several families from an apartment complex somewhere in contemporary industrial England. Living in a row like unlikely peas in a pod are teenage youth Jamie and his single barmaid mum, Ste (Jamie's chum) and Ste's single (alcoholic and physically abusive) father and older brother, and an elderly Caribbean woman and her granddaughter Lea, a sassy high school drop-out(?) with a passion for Mama Cass records. (By the way, Mama Cass delivers the only fully intelligble lines in the entire movie.)It is not an easy life for any of the young people--or the adults, for that matter--in this story. Lea is self-deluded and about as lost as any young girl can be. Jamie is relentlessly teased for being &quot;bent&quot; and &quot;a fluff&quot; at school, a torment he is too ashamed of to report to his mother. Neighbor Ste is brutally beaten by his father and brother for the slightest infractions. The most touching scene in the movie for me was when Ste first shows Jamie his bruises and Jamie offers to rub his back with a soothing cream, the kind sold to self-pampering housewives in The Body Shoppe. In Jamie's hands, the cream takes on the importance of a sacred unction, a balm of Gilead.It is apparent throughout this movie that skin to skin contact-- touch--is the most primal way people communicate, establish trust, and form opinions about themselves. &quot;You're all right,&quot; Jamie's mother assures him shortly after relentlessly pummeling him during a fit of frustration. One wonders whether such words of assurance can ever undo the messages communicated by direct physical violence. In Jamie's case, perhaps. His mother's efforts to stand by her son are consistent and sincere (bouts of frustration and parental ineptitude aside). In Ste's case, it is only through the gentle, loving contact he receives from Jamie (and Jamie's mother) that he can even begin to realize that he counts for something.Amidst all this violence and pain is the omnipresent voice of Mama Cass blasting from Lea's hi-fi. This can be heard as the &quot;la-di-da&quot; voice of denial, a voice emanating from the far away world of sunshine and flowers (California) and the long-ago time of the Summer of [Innocence and] Love (1967). Or it can be heard as the hymns and creeds of a new religion, one whose chief doctrine is the power of love to conquer hate, violence, and intolerance.The film has a few loose ends that left me puzzled, but overall I'd call this a great film. I highly recommend it.

This "zero tolerance approach to punctuation" is a fun ride through the messups and missteps of others. Author Lynne Truss's basic premise is that punctuation matters. Rather than compiling hard and fast rules, she provides examples of where wrong (or no) punctuation causes confusion. And she's up-to-date in taking on email conventions like the excessive use of emoticons, dashes, and ellipses.This is probably of most use to people who already care about commas and colons, who enjoying seeing their pet peeves peeve others as well. People really trying to master grammar and punctuation might feel a little underserved.My favorite anecdote is Truss's description of a woman at a book signing who complained that she always wished she new how to punctuate and that someone would write a book that would show her how. I think we've all met this woman in one sphere of our lives or another. The willfully lost person who refuses to look at the map before them. Surely, she fits some Jungian archetype. Truss's book may not provide a comprehensive treatment of the subject, but she certainly goes out of her way to make the subject interesting even to the woefully ignorant.PS, The title is explained on the back cover.

This stranger-than-fiction account of the relationship of two key figures behind the creation of the mamouth Oxford English Dictionary truly reads like a novel. It tells of James Murray, the young scholar to whom the job of overseeing the writing and editing of the OED fell, and Dr. William Minor, an American inmate at Broadmoor lunatic asylum, who turned out to be one of Murray's most prolific researcher-writers. The story has all the elements of a juicy Victorian novel--murder, madness, men's clubs, self-mutilation, class tensions, economic struggles, and immense undertakings that only a megalomaniac or fool would dare attempt. Winchester does a good job of describing technical information (the collection and organizing of the dictionary's definitions; evolving ways of defining and treating insanity) without being opaque or dull. At the same time he employs great compassion when telling the tragic events that enveloped the story's key characters. Winchester's story telling is never heavy-handed. I especially found it amusing thew way he peppered his account with repeated statements about how everyone involved in the creation of the OED vastly underestimated how long the project would take to complete. At one point, after working for many years and always missing the publisher's deadlines, Murray confidently claims, "I have got to the stage where I can estimate the end. In all human probability the Oxford English Dictionary will be finished on my eightieth birthday, four years from now." Winchester wryly adds, "But it was not to be. Neither was the OED to be completed in four years, nor was Sir James ever to become an octogenarian." All in all, the last volume was publishe 44 years after the project began.

Finally, Matthew Bourne's innovative production of Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE is available on DVD. This is not a camp send-up of the balletic war horse, but a modern, freshly imagined telling of a tale of enchantment, betrayal, disenchantment, and release. What most people already know about this production is that the swans and cygnets are performed by male dancers, that the choreography emphasizes the aggressive rather than the graceful movements in swans' repertoire, and that the story is heavily freighted with Freudian implications as it shows a young prince's efforts to break free of his mother's hold (she's part Merry Widow and part Cruella deVil). The viewer who tries to analyze plot points too carefully is heading toward frustration and confusion. (For those who just can't let it alone, there's a helpful on-screen synopsis you can jump to whenever you need it.) The best way to enjoy this production is by focusing on the choreography and the dancing itself. Adam Cooper's nameless Swan is powerful, persistent, and unapologetic. He could be the prince's alter ego, his embodied desires, the id, or just about anything else you'd want to ascribe to him. He woos son and mother with equal conviction. Besides the moments when Cooper is on stage/screen, the choreographic hightlight of this production for me was the dance of the cygnets (pas de quatre). This is a moment of levity in every production of SWAN LAKE, but more so here where the mischievous antics and curiosity of the cygnets are played for all they're worth.The other thing worth commenting on is the quality of the filming of this live performance. I have usually been disappointed by ballets on film--presentation is often static, or feet and hands get cut out of the picture, or the camera goes in for a close-up at a point when something significant is happening in the choreography. Given the trade-offs, Adventures in Motion Pictures has done an excellent job of capturing all the key choreography while creatively managing close-ups, transitions, and montages. The colors are rich and expressive (the dance of the swans by the lake is bathed in a haunting nocturnal blue). And best of all, the film is completely free of the annoying halos and bizarre shimmerings that always seem to make their way into filmed stage productions.

Most of the contributors to this volume of essays on HBO's 5-season hit SIX FEET UNDER praise the series as groundbreaking, smart, well-written, honest, and deeply felt. I share their high opinion of SFU and find that I continue to find new things to delight in (if you can use that expression for a series that focuses on death and damaged human relations) each time I watch an episode.If you're a fan of SFU or just someone who likes to watch television thoughtfully, you'll find this volume helpful. These are not newspaper style reviews; most are essays by academics focusing on one character or aspect of the show. There is academic jargon here to be sure (in some essays more than others), but I found I could navigate it fairly easily with a dictionary at my elbow (though I had to Google "diegesis" to understand Peter Kaye's article on the music of SFU). Special attention was given to gender issues. Part III is entitled "Post-Patriarchal Dilemmas: Making Visible the Female Subject" and contains essays on Ruth Fisher (the mother whose unexpected and premature widowhood launches season 1), Claire (her only daughter), and Brenda (a complicated outsider who becomes increasingly involved with the family over the course of the series). I found Erin's MacLeod's "Desperately Seeking Brenda: Writing the Self in Six Feet Under" especially engaging--in part, because I found this character more baffling and frustrating than any other in the show. As with many of the essays in this volume, I suspect MacLeod wrote her essay at some point during season 3 or 4, but certainly well before Brenda's full trajectory was known. She seemed to have missed the opportunity to comment on Brenda's personal post-patriarchal experience (the death of her own father, Bernard Chenowith). I think the volume would have been greatly enhanced if contributors were given an opportunity to attach Afterwords to their essays based on having seen the entire series, including the amazing final episode in which viewers are shown exactly how each of the main characters faces her/his own death.Gender is also the key theme in "Part IV: Post-Patriarchal Dilemmas: Masculinities Reconsidered," with Queer Theory playing an important role in Brian Singleton's "Queering the Church," which focuses on the way David Fisher deals with his homosexuality, and Samuel A. Chambers's "Revisiting the Closet," which focuses on the experiences Russell Corwin, an art school classmate of Claire's, a relatively minor character in the series. Again, it would have been interesting to know what these authors thought upon seeing the last episode of season 5.My favorite essay in the whole volume, however, was "Playing in the Deep End of the Pool" by Thomas Lynch, who is a funeral director (from a family of funeral directors) in addition to being a skilled writer. Besides providing useful insights into SFU's portrayal of his profession, he gives the first critical perspective I've read on Jessica Mitford's classic 1963 expose of the death care industry, THE AMERICAN WAY OF DEATH, that makes sense without seeming defensive.The book includes an Episode Guide (through the end of season 4); a Film and TV Guide (baffling for what it includes--The King and I?--as well as for what it omits--where are Rachel, Rachel; Four Weddings and a Funeral; Longtime Companion; The Passion of the Christ, to name a few?); a Bibliography that doesn't include every work sited by the authors; and an Index.

THE HISTORY BOYS, Alan Bennett's play (and now also a screenplay) is about a group eight teenage boys being groomed by their teachers and headmaster to pass the examination that hopefully will admit them to either Oxford or Cambridge University, and from there to who knows what kind of position of priviledge and leadership in the larger world. It takes place in the 1980s (a Pet Shop Boys song is the most current cultural reference in the play), and it is clear that the world, like the eight boys themselves, is in a period of transition. The boys, like boys everywhere, are easily distracted by sexual thoughts and are eager to impress one another and rattle their teachers. The two key influencers on their young lives are the English teacher, Hector, and a history teacher, Irwin. Hector plays yin to Irwin's yang. He floods the boys with poetry and literary quotations, encourages them to enact scenes in French, lets them quote movie dialogue in the hopes of stumping him and winnng the pool he forces them to contibute to, and fondles them as opportunity allows on the back of his motorcycle. Irwin, on the other hand, is a more cynical influence. The headmaster has called him in to teach the boys to perform, knowing that the examiners will be looking to be dazzled by memorable eccentricities rather than swayed by the accuteness of their thoughts, breadth of their reading, or depth of their wisdom. "History nowadays is not a matter of conviction. It's a performance. It's entertainment. And if it isn't, make it so." While everyone seems to be proceeding in earnest, the audience can't help but feel all these efforts are of little use in a world that is rapidly changing. As another teacher, Mrs. Lintott, observes about the boys' futures in the closing scene of the play, "[They are] pillars of a community that no longer has much use for pillars," aptly encapsulating the play's melancholic, post-colonial mood.Readers should be alerted that there are two distinct versions of the script available--one for the play as originally performed in London and New York (2004/2005) and the filmscript for the 2006 BBC/Fox Searchlight Films release. Both are good and both tell essentially the same story. Bennett's dialogue, as always, is witty, honest, and right on the money. His themes broad and important, his characters deeply flawed but lovable nonetheless.If you're a purist, you'll probably want to buy the play script (ISBN 0571224644). It includes a 20+ page introduction by Bennett in which he gives the reader useful background information about the changing face of the British educational system over the past several decades.But the screenplay (ISBN 0865479712) has its merits too. The nice thing about the film is that it was produced using all the principals responsible for the success of the play: Nicholas Hytner directed both, employing the same cast. By the time the film was shot, the actors had internalized their parts and were able to bring them to the screen with apparent ease and confidence. As Hytner's introduction to the filmscript makes clear, the lack of "big-name" stars and his and Bennett's firm commitment to the careful preservation of all the play's best features made financing the picture a real challenge. But it seems they succeeded (a DVD of the film is due out in April 2007).Hytner's introduction in the screenplay is thoughtful and will be of interest to people who like to reflect on film adaptation; Bennett's "Film Diary" is typical Bennett, full of dry wit and bemused reflections on his unanticipated success. The script itself seems to follow the play closely (and includes scenes that ultimately needed to be cut to achieve the desired length, suggesting perhaps that the financers who ultimately stepped forward weren't exactly always silent partners). The scene directions (totally lacking in the play script) help the reader understand the many time- and scene-shifts that happen over the course of the story. But the real treat in the screenplay edition are the 43 photographs showing the cast and crew at work. This collection of stills and candid shots are clear evidence that everyone involved with this production was fully engaged and loving the experience.

This new work put out under the auspices of the British Museum has what it takes to become THE standard desk reference on the Ancient Near East. Entries are clear and concise (the longest run to two and a half columns). Also, they are good about letting the reader know which archaeological and historical issues are still matters of dispute (in other words, there seems to be no faking of certainty). Although there are no color plates, almost every page has a well-chosen and informative photograph or illustration. Maps and charts are simple and easy to absorb. The editors and their staff get major points for the quality and extent of their cross-referencing and indexing. It's very easy to spend hours following all the interesting leads and connections from one article to another. Many alphabatized reference works don't even bother with an index (&quot;The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization&quot; is an example of a work that desperately needs one); but, as anyone who has to do quick look-ups on the fly knows, an index is a great asset in any single-volume desk reference work.Information the publisher should have given to Amazon.com: (1) The definition of the Ancient Near East the editors follow is the one used by the British Museum: Mesopotamia, Iran, Anatola, the Caucasus, the Levant and Arabia; (2) The chronological range covered by the entries stretches from 1.5 million years ago to the fall of Babylon to the Persian Cyrus the Great in 539 B.C. [Yes, dates are identified as &quot;B.C.&quot;, not &quot;B.C.E.&quot;]; (3) Besides information about the ANE that you'd expect to find, this dictionary includes information on the discoverers as well--the people and institutions who made significant contributions to ANE studies. (Although I'm not qualified to judge, I suspect the Brits are over-represented.)Things I would like to see added in subsequent editions: (1) A general introduction that give the reader some context and background; (2) A timeline that relates what was happening in the ANE to the growth of civilization in Egypt. (I accept the need to limit discussion of Egypt in the individual entries, but would have appreciated a schematic that gave me a workable overview. Don't the Assyriologists ever talk to the Egyptologists at the British Museum?)Overall an excellent work! I'm glad to own a copy.

Compiled after John Lennon's death (but before Harrison's), it is amazing how this 12-hour documentary seems to capture his personality, presence, and participation. The thoughtful (and at times playful) editing of mucho miles of archival film and recent interview footage makes it possible to feel like each Beatle received equal attention. Perhaps because John was often the group's spokesperson during their heyday, he is amply represented by talkshow clips (including an interview with a very young David Frost).Because the film covers only the decade in which the Beatles were the Beatles (post-Beatles careers are not discussed or analyzed), but does so from a 30+ year vantage point, the film serves as a very interesting study on memory. The surviving Beatles remember events (recording sessions, concerts, conversations, etc.) quite differently, and there is no impartial third-party commentator to enlighten the audience. It is very much like being at a family reunion--it's the quality and depth of the relationships that count, not the accuracy of the events recalled. In some cases, however, original footage contradicts a Beatle's memory. It is these lapses of memory, the humble and honest self-assessments, the willingness to forgive, the cherishing of what exisited and was special, and a mature perspective on fame and success that make this film a joy to watch. It's gratifying that Paul, George, and Ringo did not become like the "late Elvis" (a fear they admit to in the film). Yes, they became a little mellow with age. But they didn't cease to be interesting, thoughtful, or creative.This film is accurately called an "anthology." The archival footage is generous. In most cases two or more full songs from a single concert are captured. And there are generous clips from all of their movies. Also of interest are the mini-films the Beatles made when they later tired of touring. They sent these films to television shows in their stead, allowing them to stay home with their growing families and avoid the screaming fans. In essence, they invented the music-video, a mainstay of the pop music industry today.Towards the end of Part 8, the final segment, Paul observes that "looking back, almost every song was about love. That's a very positive thing. You can't argue with that, right?" The Beatles were revolutionary in so many ways, but they were never nihilists.

After finishing Alain de Botton's biography/novel KISS AND TELL, I found myself hoping on behalf of its putative subject Isabel Jane Rogers that this work is more fiction than fact. Or at least that "Isabel" is a composite of every young woman the author ever dated and not a real individual person. Although de Botton catalogs many of "Isabel's" quirky habits (her poor sense of geography, the way she picks her nose and chews on the callouses on her fingers, etc.), he exhibits enough of his own dubious traits (for instance, he admits letting her plants die unwatered while devouring half a box of her chocolates while house-sitting for her one time) to give us a sense that in some unprovable way, he is at least playing fair.But under this delicious patina of pettiness, there are a number of more serious subjects. Such as the nature of biography itself. And whether our versions of ourselves are any more reliable than those of an outside observer. The nature of memory. And a comparison of the virtues and liabilities of the fat, detail-obsessed Boswelian biographies versus the "toast-sized", summary-style biographical sketches of an Aubrey. (Anyone who has read--or tried to write--an obituary for a family member will find the chapter "In Search of an Ending" fascinating.) And anyone who is familiar with de Botton's other works will not be surprised how he manages to draw the likes of Marcel Proust, Adam Smith, Frederick Nietzsche, Tolstoy, and Hippocrates into the conversation, as well as zany bits of pop psychology like graphology, palmistry, and magazine personality questionnaires. To support the trope that KISS AND TELL is a real biography, de Botton even provides a 12-page, fully functioning index (complete with entries on "toenails" and "sex.") As a work of fiction, KISS AND TELL isn't nearly as interesting as his earlier novel, ON LOVE, but it is an amusing book...and it will make you think about your own quirks and self-delusions.

One of the nice things about a quadruple biography is that you don't have to bear the foibles and character defects of any one of its four subjects for too long. The interplay of personalities--the supersized egos of Bob Dylan, Richard Farina, and Joan Baez as well as the more humanly-proportioned ego of Mimi Baez Farina--is fascinating. Author David Hajdu is thorough in his research (extensive interviews with many people, some now deceased), unbiased in his assessments, and reasonably skeptical when quoting the subjects as they reflect on themselves and on one another. Hajdu seems well-informed on music in general and presents the phenomenon of the 60s folk revival in a way that seems true and fair (I speak as someone who has owned and still owns most of the vinyl ablumns mentioned in the book). Long before Madonna became the daring of academics for her ability to shed skins and transform herself annually, Dylan, Farina, and the elder Baez were conciously and single-mindedly crafting their personae to meet audience expectations and assure their own success. The competition among the four is extreme. But so is the affection and loyalty (distorted and self-serving though it may have been at times). One finishes the book with a sense that the key to success is wanting it deperately; talent and good luck, though nice in their own way, are less essential. Overall, the Baez women come off better than the men. The pacifist Joan was capable of incredible cattiness in her personal relationships, but could be generous professionally (for instance, she continued to promote Bob Dylan even after he dumped her as his lover and publicly mocked her, sometimes in song). Aside from Mimi's somewhat saintly aura, there are no villains or heroes here. Unlike the writers of the protest songs of the folk revival, Hajdu does not see things in black and white. His subjects live quite colorfully on these pages--and without apology for their shortcomings and inconsistancies. This is an intriguing story told with aptly chosen and fascinating details.

Simon Vance does a great job reading Peter Ackryod's compelling biography of the English language's greatest dramatist. At a running time of 19 hours, this is no mean feat. I simply loaded up the CD player in my car and listened to a bit each time I went to the store or for a ride. Except when parallel parking, my mind never drifted. If you like audio books, this one won't disappoint.What I liked about Ackroyd's take on Shakespeare is that (1) he doesn't make claims or take positions for which there is no evidence (e.g., while there seems to be strong evidence that Shakespeare's father was a Roman Catholic, the dramatist himself seems to have been ambivalent about, if not indifferent to religion); (2) he presents the little biographical evidence that is available in a convincing way (these include records of legal battles and his last will and testament); (3) he knows British history and the history of London like the back of his hand (a time of plagues and politics); (4) he understands the nature of Elizabethan theater (its relation to other forms of entertainment like bear-baiting and mystery plays, as well as the collaborative nature of writing and producing plays, the practice of using boys to play women's roles and how venues and availability of specific actors influenced the way plays and characters ended up being written); and (5) he relies primarily on the plays and poetic works themselves to reveal Shakespeare's evolving concerns and shifting obsessions. What I took away from Ackroyd's biography is a deeper appreciation of the fact that Shakespeare was first and foremost a man of the theater--he wrote (alone and in partnership with others), he acted, and he produced plays. He was aware of tastes and trends. He experienced both a healthy and unhealthy sense of competition. He was not above changing plays to suit audience tastes and to suit different venues. He wrote quickly to meet deadlines. He researched only as much as he needed to to create a character or plot. He "borrowed" from others (and from himself). He cut speeches from plays only to insert them later into other plays. In short he was a man of deep commitment and immense creative energy. An entrepreneur and a true showman. Ackroyd really seems to know his stuff and has done a great job giving us a sense of the man who was Shakespeare. Whether you read this biorgarphy or listen to it, you'll find yourself being drawn irresistably to another place and time. A great pleasure!

This is a very slick and beautiful documentary--as you might expect considering the subject matter. And it really is about the era (the mid-60s) depicted in the hit TV show Mad Men. And like the TV series, it's part love montage, part cautionary tale. The seductive part is the array of kookie and iconoclastic (and sometimes downright potty-mouthed) creatives who reminisce about some of the all-time most memorable ad campaigns they worked on. Nike's "Just do it" slogan, we're told, comes from Gary Gillmore's last words to his executioners. "Where's the beef?" was almost rejected by the client. (These real-life creatives can make Don Draper look downright deferential. No shortage of self-confidence here.) My favorite ad person was Mary Wells, the mastermind behind the Braniff airlines make-over. Trained as an actress, she felt a need to bring theater to the business of selling. For Braniff she redesigned the planes before even beginning work on the ads. And she wrangled Pucci into designing uniforms for the flight attendants (called stewardesses in the ads), complete with space bubble helmets! The cautionary elements of the film are more subtle. They consist of statistics displayed on the screen announcing the obscene amounts of money spent on advertizing, the number or ads the average unsuspecting citizen is exposed to daily, etc. In the end, it's a little sad (and scary) just how aspirational we consumers are. And how desperately we want to be sold something--anything--that will make us okay, complete. Behind the surface shimmer, this is a very profound film.

A quick and pleasant read (REAL quick if you skip the stats that comprise about thirty percent of the text). Autobiographies seem to fall into three categories: (1) &quot;tell it all before someone else tells on you&quot; (Billie Holiday's LADY SINGS THE BLUES), (2) &quot;getting even with one's enemies&quot; (Nancy Reagan's MY TURN), and (3) &quot;Gee, I can't believe people pay me to do what I love&quot; (Xaviera Hollander's THE HAPPY HOOKER).Cynically, you could say there's a fourth category--the market-driven, &quot;strike while the iron is hot&quot; autobiography. Sosa's book probably falls into this last category, though it is presented as a &quot;Gee, I can't believe it&quot; type (but with touches of the defensiveness found in &quot;getting even&quot; types of autobiographies). Hispanic journalist Breton had done a good job of interviewing people in Sosa's life and arranging testimonials in a way that keeps Sosa's story moving. Baseball fans will probably enjoy reading what Sosa has to say about how he improved his batting technique, how he handled the disappointment of being sent back to the minor league, how he viewed his home-run competition with Mark McGwire in 1998. Young people looking for a sports hero will benefit from what Sosa (&quot;Mikey&quot; to his friends and family) has to say about loyalty to family, remembering where one comes from, learning from ones mistakes, handling gossipers and nay-sayers, believing in oneself, and giving back to one's community. People looking for a profound psychological portrait of the author or an insightful take on the business and game of baseball will be disappointed. While no-one would expect someone as guileless as Sosa to trash his teammates and fellow ballplayers, the book could have used a few more clubhouse anecdotes.

The John Knox Press INTERPETATION COMMENTARY series provides thoughtful but highly readable insights into the various books of the Bible. I haven't picked up a volume yet which disappointed me. But Carol Bechtel's commentary on ESTHER really goes the extra mile. It's chock full of fresh perspectives well stated. (Although she borrows many of these insights from the recently published commentaries of Adele Berlin and Jon Levenson, she is quick to credit her sources. And she is very selective about what she restates.)The commentary is directed primarily to Christians, and to Protestants specifically. She raises an interesting point that Christians who "get their Scripture" solely from the lessons that are read aloud as part of Sunday services, are only exposed to a reading from Esther once every three years: Esther 7:1-6,9-10; 9:20-22. This clearly is not the best way to experience a book of the Bible that is a cleverly constructed "novella" with exciting characters, court intrigues, and dizzying plot reversals. She encourages Christians to imitate Jews by reading the book repeatedly, aloud, and in its entirety. As Bechtel points out, "It is a book, after all, about the struggle to be faithful in the midst of an increasingly unfaithful culture. It is a story of courage, faith, and deliverance. It is the story of men and women working together with a God who is not always obvious, but who is always gracious."To use this commentary most effectively, you need to have a copy of the New Revised Standard Version Bible (preferrably with the Apocrypal/Deuterocanonical books) since the biblical text is not printed in the commentary. You do not need any knowledge of Hebrew (or Greek), however. Where an understanding of the Hebrew is essential, Bechtel provides clear explanations. One example, her explanation of how the Hebrew words for "enslavement" and "destruction" are homophones, serves as a very plausible explanation of why the King could have been so easily duped into signing a death warrant for the Jewish people.Although Bechtel presents the shorter, Hebrew version of Esther as the "best text," she does examine the Additions to Esther (those passages that are found only in the Greek and Latin versions of the text) in a brief Appendix.

On the surface, A Disgraceful Affair is Bianca Lamblin's account of her brief triangular relationship with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre and how that affair affected her life long after Sartre's, then Beauvoir's, romantic interest waned. Its carefully guarded sentences reveal a woman who has been deepley hurt by her mentors but who is being painstakingly careful in her effort to be fair as she sets the record straight. Readers looking for juicy tidbits will need to look elsewhere (Lamblin describes Sartre as a charming wooer but an unskilled lover, and does not waste ink elaborating).If the reader takes the facts as the author presents them--and there is nothing implausible or erractic in what Lamblin relates--what unfolds is a brief, startlingly clear reflection on what it means to evolve one's own workable philosophy of life based on the cards one is dealt and the living examples one has to choose from. After her rejection by her existentalist mentors, Lamblin consciously chose a conventional, slightly leftist, life. Her mentors' narcissism seems to have turned her away from a life focused on pursuing celebrity and getting published (aside from a few academic philosophy articles, A Disgraceful Affair is Lamblin's only published work, one she didn't begin writing until she was in her seventies and all the key figures in the story had died). Unlike her mentors, she chose to marry and have children, decisions that disturbed and disgusted Beauvoir.Those looking for portraits of Sartre and Beauvoir should know that Beauvoir (unfortunately called &quot;the Beaver&quot; throughout the book, a nickname that might have been better left untranslated) is the more fully realized. Lamblin renewed her relationship with Beauvoir after the War and continued to have platonic meetings with her for the rest of Beauvoir's life. Lamblin's depiction of Beauvoir's life after Sartre's death is one of profound pathos and emotional disenfranchisement. By that point, Beauvoir's alcoholism was quite advanced and the reader senses that the great thinker and prolific writer's death must have been a lonely, troubled, and confusing end indeed.The reader should be warned that there is a sort of craftlessness to Lamblin's writing. For me, this added to the sense of authenticity of what she was attempting to communicate. She often tells the reader what she is going to say--or why she is relating a particular incident--before launching into her account of an event. This tends to pull the reader up short. As off-putting as this might be, for me it further convinced me of the author's essential guilelessness and I ultimately judged this practice as awkward but not offensive. In addition, I suspect that Julie Plovnick's translation of the French original is a little wooden and literal-minded (for instance, she translates &quot;lucide&quot; as &quot;lucid&quot; in a context where I suspect &quot;perceptive&quot; might have been the intended meaning).Readers interested in the way people, and especially women, make meaning of the troubles life throws their way will enjoy this book. Other books along this line that I have enjoyed are Girl Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen, The Liar's Club by Mary Karr, and A Loving Gentleman: The Love Story of William Faulkner and Meta Carpenter by Meta Carpenter Wilde and Orin Borsten.

I've always been a fan of the TANAKH Translation of the Hebrew Bible (aka Old Testament), but have been unable to find a volume that had study notes for the entire translation. The Jewish Publication Society (copyright holder of the TANAKH) has nice Commentaries on the individual books of the Torah (plus Jonah and Esther), but these cover only the books mentioned and are too unwieldy for everyday use.Oxford Univ. Press has produced a great single-volume work that is beautifully typeset and easy to read. Each book has an engaging introduction and helpful sidebar notes and commentary provided by reputable Jewish scholars. These notes are organized as thought units, not as random facts and definitions. Although the TANAKH does not break down the text into subunits with section heads, the scholars providing the notes do this in a non-obtrusive manner. I find this to be a very respectful way to treat the Scripture text. (Many Christian study Bibles intrude upon the text in such a willy-nilly manner it can be hard for even a serious Bible-reader to know where the Scripture ends and the &quot;commentating&quot; has begun.)The volume concludes with 200-pages worth of essays: 7 on Jewish interpretation of the Bible; 8 on the Bible in Jewish life and thought; and 9 on backgrounds for reading the Bible (some of which are adaptations of essays found in Oxford's Annotated Bible). Like most study Bibles, the Jewish Study Bible has a timeline to help the reader get an approximate sense of when key biblical events occurred. What's nice about the JSB is that it also has a Chronological Table of Rulers listing rulers not directly referenced in the Bible; this helps the reader better place those that are. The 20-page glossary covers literary and theological terms (casuistic law, etiology, haplography, Oral Torah, etc.) as well as key names and terms from the biblical text.As for &quot;chutzpah&quot;...this can be found in the commentator's note on Isaiah 44.9-13: &quot;God rebukes [the people] for their chutzpah in questioning the means through whom God chose to work.&quot; I offer this as evidence that the authors do not confine themselves to dry, esoteric scholarly ways of expression.

I saw this version of one of Shakespeare's "war of the sexes" comedies when it was first broadcast on television in 1970. I was immediately won over to the idea that an intelligent director and ensemble could do a lot to make Shakespeare accessible to a new generation by simply setting his plays in a different era. The turn-of-the-century American setting worked perfectly. The women challenge male authority by sneaking a smoke, Dogberry and his entourage are portrayed as Keystone cops. The cast was excellent. Kathleen Widdoes and Sam Waterson were equally convincing in their gender battles, their self-righteous moments, and in their tender love scenes.What struck me on my recent viewing was just how dark this comedy gets. Claudio is easily convinced of his fiancee's infidelity and publicly humiliates her and repudiates his vows. Although everything, and everyone, is reconciled in the end, we realize that the turf between true heroes and true villains is amply populated with fools, wimps, and cads.Athough this is more of a filmed stage production than a movie version of the play, it is cleverly filmed and engaging. Personally, I prefer this version to Branaugh's filmed version (which I enjoyed immensely but felt it was less faithful to Shakespeare's text.) Unfortunately, there are no real DVD extras to this landmark production; but the performance is worth the purchase price.

As Freedman acknowledges in his Preface, this book is the written version of three talks given at the University of Michigan in 1988. As lectures, they are little more than a sketch of the elements that distinguish the three main sections of the Hebrew Bible: The Primary History (Torah and the Former Prophets), The Latter Prophets, and The Writings. He spends a fair amount of time looking at the symetry of the Hebrew canon and comparing the word counts of the Bible's different components. Freedman later expanded his discussion on the Decalogue found in the lecture on the Primary History into a full book called THE NINE COMMANDMENTS (I recommend it highly). I found the chapter on The Writings to be especially interesting. Freedman sees strong connections between Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah (where David, Jerusalem, and the Temple are idealized) and the Psalms and Wisdom literature (usually attributed to David's heir Solomon). It is also, only in The Writings that King Cyrus of Persia is mentioned. There's lots here to think about, whether you buy all of Freedman's arguments or not. And after so many years of scholarly efforts to parse the Bible into bits and pieces, it's nice to see someone who is willing to stand back a bit and look at the canon as a whole.

As in FLAUBERT'S PARROT, the stories in this collection are Barnes's speculations on what someone at the end of his (or her) life might think or do. In "The Things You Know" he presents a pair of rival widows who continue their friendship in spite of what they know and resent about each other. In "The Revival" Barnes speculates on the late-life thoughts of the accomplished novelist, but failed playwright, Ivan Turgenev. In "Vigilance" he slowly reveals the key to the deep remorse (rage?) of a curmudgeony gay man with a personal mission to suppress (or evict) coughers at concert recitals. The scenarios in these eleven stories are diverse, and the characters' dilemmas and their responses to those dilemmas are plausible. It is uncanny that Barnes (who presumably wrote these stories in his early and mid fifties) can project himself so easily forward into old age. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't find these reflections morbid. I find each of his aged characters to have some sort of enobling characteristic. Often, they seem to have an amazing ability to continue to negotiate with life, as when the wife in "Appetite" discovers that she can get some spark of life from her senile (Alzheimer stricken?) husband by reading to him from cook books, in spite of his failing mental abilities and his propensity to break out in obscene ramblings.Perhaps my personal favorite in the collection is "Knowing French," which consists of putative correspondence to the author from Sylvia Winstanley, an inmate in an "old folkery." It would be easy to enjoy this story for its surface charm, the vanity of an old woman trying to impress a published author, who tosses off French phrases while misspelling simple English words. But the fact that this is one-sided communication gives their progression an eerie quality. It makes one wonder (in an existential sort of way), if our own understanding of our life is enough. Can a life's meaning be discerned by one person's version? The story concludes with two letters to the author from the old folkery's warden, in which he twice calls her "the life and soul of the party," a far cry from her self-perception as a misunderstood and under-appreciated trouble-maker. It is in touches and turns like this that make Barnes's stories so rich and worth reading (and re-reading).

Hollywood gets mixed reviews on its ability to present plausible psychiatrist-patient relationships on film. On the tacky end of the scale are DAVID AND LISA and FINAL ANALYSIS; on the &quot;deeply moving&quot; end of the scale are ORDINARY PEOPLE and GOOD WILL HUNTING. Most, like THE THREE FACES OF EVE fall somewhere in the middle--interesting though unsubtle stories that reduce the patient's neurosis to a single mystery that needs to be unlocked by an indefatiguable professional who is egoless and has the blank personality to prove it.Sidney Lumet's adaptation of the Peter Shaffer's stage play EQUUS is exceptional for its ability to transport to film the full emotional complexity and intensity of a psychiatrist's relationship with one of his patients. And this is done almost entirely through the skill of the actors: Richard Burton as the psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart, Peter Firth as the disturbed stable boy who inexplicably blinded several of the horses in his care, Colin Blakely and Joan Plowright as the boy's religiously incompatible parents, and Eileen Atkins as a judge who has asked Dr. Dysart to take on this challenging case. This is not to minimize other contributions--the cinematography is exceedingly intelligent and unobtrusive. It's simply to say that Lumet seems to have realized that he had assembled a dream cast and made every effort to stay out of their way and to let each actor shine. Burton's performance is perhaps the best of his film career. Though intense at times, he is completely devoid of the stagey &quot;haminess&quot; that has marred some of his other film performances. Firth, as the patient, moves easily from jingle-singing dissociated boy, to surly rebellious youth, to a sort of highly eroticized mythic being. It is truly fascinating to watch. Because the psychiatrist has issues of his own, and because the story is as much about his coming to terms with his own demons as with those of his patient, EQUUS is not your typical Hollywood psychotherapy movie. It delves into the mythology and religion as well as the human condition. In the end, the film gives you a lot to think about after you've hit the stop button on your remote. A disturbing but powerful film.

This restrained urban drama about a Berlin call boy and the woman who lives across the hall from him calls to mind Thoreau's assessment, "most men lead lives of quiet desperation." Theo lives quietly alone with two answering machines (one private, the other for taking messages from men responding to his ads). Handsome, clean, and seemingly intelligent, he has no real friends. We see him make only one phone call to his mother, to make excuses why he is unable to visit her. Across the hall is Marie, a depressed record store clerk who struggles to make a life with Paul, an unsuccessful writer who seems to be living on her dime. When Paul leaves Marie (something we learn happens with el Nino-like frequency), Marie goes into a deep funk. Theo, playing the Good Samaritan, becomes concerned and slowly coaxes her out of her depression and eventually out of her apartment (after forcing the lock with a wire coat hanger). Theo and Marie have seen each other at their worst and make no effort to keep secrets from each other. This degree of honesty and mutual acceptance seems to offer a glimmer of hope to the pair...and to anyone who wonders if real intimacy is possible. Although negative patterns re-emerge for both of them, the fact that each of them has grown a little in their own self-awareness keeps this quiet but taut film from being totally pessimistic. The film is also refreshingly free of cliches about hustlers and gay men in general.There are no DVD extras, which is a shame. I would love to know more about the director and actors. Rather than grouse about the quality of the transfer to DVD, I'm going to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and say that the graininess of the print is one way they sought to convey the grittiness of Theo and Marie's lives.

Peter Barry's BEGINNING THEORY introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory is lucid, engaging, and challenging, and would make an ideal classroom text; but it's also a good one for those individuals like me who have been out of school for some time and are a little curious about how the reading and study of literature has changed over the past few decades. The book's thirteen chapters cover traditional criticism (liberal humanism); structuralism; post-structuralism and deconstruction; postmodernism; psychoanalytic criticism; feminist criticism; lesbian/gay criticism; Marxist criticism; new historicism and cultural materialism; postcolonial criticism; stylistics; narratology; and ecocriticism (the latter being the new kid on the block and usually not included in comparable Theory Introductions). Barry may not be the last word on all these subjects, but I felt he's a good starting point for just about anyone. He advocates reading carefully a few of the most pivotal texts on the subjects covered (rather than reading as broadly as possible); he succinctly summarizes each theory's tenets and practices in easy-to-absorb lists; he encourages readers to apply the theories in some way in "Stop and Think" exercises; and he provides annotated select reading lists for each chapter. This is a book I expect I'll be returning to time and again as I try to read some of the primary texts Barry recommends.

George Balanchine is remembered most for his one-act, abstract, storyless ballets and is thought to have shunned the full-evening ballets that tell a story. Yet his version of "The Nutcracker" is an annual Christmas money-maker for the ballet company Balanchine helped found (the New York City Ballet) and that company's summer season often closes with his other great story ballet, "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Indeed, the two ballets in many ways seem to be stamped from the same cookie cutter. Both dispose of their drama in the first act and use the second act to dazzle the audience with some splendid divertissements; both ignore the sacred roots of the Christian "feast days" they were created around (the Nativity of our Lord for "The Nutcracker" and the Nativity of St. John the Baptist for "A Midsummer Night's Dream"); and both are littered with ample roles for the School of American Ballet's many child dancers (in "Nutcracker" they are cast as greedy, mutually teasing, parent-manipulated brats romping around the Christmas tree; in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" they are charming, almost camp, butterflies and fairies...though one page does get caught in a custody battle between Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies.)If Balanchine resented choreographing these two story ballets, he hid his resentment well. "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is for me the better ballet. The children are well-integrated into what is certainly an adult storyline of sexual jealousy and comical mishaps. And the Pacific Northwest Ballet under the artistic direction of Francia Russell have done Mr. B. proud. Martin Pakledinaz's costumes rival those of Karinska (would it be sacrilege to admit I actually prefer his over hers?) and his set design, with it's oversized frogs and flower blossoms, playfully dwarfs the dancers, reminding us that most of the characters on stage are actually miniature fairyland creatures. The dancers all perform beautifully, with Seth Belliston's Puck stealing the show. My favorite part of the ballet has always been the subplot of the four young lovers: Helena, Hermia, Lysander, and Demetrius. They are virtually interchangeable; this is signaled by their costumes--one pair wears blue on red, the other red on blue. Due to Puck's inept intervention, the lovers' interests switch with lightning speed. It is truly amusing to watch this amorous tempest in a teapot play out. (My reason for giving this wonderful ballet video 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt the filming of this pas de quatre spoiled the energy of this scene. When all four dancers are on stage, you really need to see what each one is doing to appreciate all the subtleties of the dance. The emphasis on close-ups and medium close-ups seemed to defuse the dramatic and comic tension that Balanchine so artfully created. But this is not the fault of the dancers--Lisa Apple, Julie Tobiason, Ross Yearsley, and Jeffrey Stanton give it everything they've got.) Children will enjoy seeing Titania fall in love with Bottom who has been given a donkey's head and who finds himself unable to completely return her love because of his new found love of sweet grasses.The second act dancing is beautiful, but courtly and staid. The music draws from a number of works by Felix Mendelssohn, not just from the title work. The vocal pieces sung by Libby Crabtree and Judith Harris were especially nice. the DVD has no extras, but the 12-page color booklet is crammed with interesting information.

At Frank O'Hara's funeral, composer Virgil Thomsom turned to the poet's longtime friend Joe LeSueur and said, "Baby, I hope you kept a journal." Though clearly not drawing upon stale journal entries, LeSueur's memoir of his relationship with O'Hara (which survived the vicissitudes of its ever-changing status...friends to lovers to friends, etc.) is a nice blend of personal memories and feverish impromptu research (Brad Gooch's biography seems to have been ever at his elbow). LeSueur is neither vindictive nor pointlessly benign. He truly understood and appreciated O'Hara's central position in the explosion of art that was happening in New York in the 50s and 60s. Unlike Ginsberg and the Beat poets, O'Hara was equally at ease among literary folk, musicians, and painters (especially the abstract expressionists). To read about O'Hara is to read about the greatness of post-war New York.DIGRESSIONS is actually helpful, too. Because O'Hara often adopted a casual, off-hand, personal approach when writing his poems, it is great to have someone who was intimate with the poet to explain "who's who" and "what's what." LeSueur, however, is equally comfortable admitting when he's baffled by an O'Hara reference, and explanations (and reminiscences) are never forced.One other thing--DIGRESSIONS is an enlightening portrait of gay life in New York prior to the Stonewall riots. O'Hara and LeSueur were both openly gay, though they had quite different approaches to meeting their sexual needs. O'Hara seems to have had fewer partners, usually choosing them from his circle of friends and aquaintances. LeSueur seemed to favor one-night stands and casual sex. Perhaps this difference is one reason their friendship continued long after their sexual intimacy ended. If only LeSueur had lived long enough to write DIGRESSIONS ON GAY LIFE BEFORE STONEWALL.

Although chronologicallly the four novels in this volume (which includes Faulkner's masterpiece The Sound and the Fury) are Faulkner's first, this is the last volume of his novels to come off the presses of the Library of America. This is a landmark event in the world of Belles Lettres, not just American literature! The first volume (Novels 1930-35) was published in 1985, making the publication of the definitive texts of the novels of William Faulkner a 21-year enterprise. Kudos to Library of America and editors Noel Polk and Joseph Blotner.For those who haven't heard of them, the Library of America (LOA) is a non-profit venture with the mission of publishing the definitive texts of the best of American literature in uniform clothbound editions designed to last. (Google them to find out more about their mission and for a complete list of titles in print and forthcoming.) But these are not just handsome books or cheesy Franklin Mint style collectables. Establishing the best texts for the works selected for the series is a difficult and tricky enterprise, and the most qualified scholars are sought to take on the series' diverse authors. For Faulkner this editorial task fell to two of the most prominent Faulkner scholars around, Joseph Blotner (also his biographer) and Noel Polk. LOA does not clutter up its pages with footnotes and does not commission literary introductions for its volumes, so the casual reader may be unaware of the extensive amount of scholarship that goes on "behind the scenes." As noted in brief "Notes on the Text" to the Novels 1926-1929, "By preserving Faulkner's spelling, punctuation, and wording, even when inconsistent or irregular, the Polk texts strive to be as faithful to Faulkner's usage as surviving evidence permits. In this volume, the reader has the results of the most detailed scholarly efforts thus far made to establish the texts of Soldier's Pay, Mosquitoes, Flags in the Dust, and The Sound and the Fury" (p. 1175).Since the publisher's own description of this volume here on Amazon.com doesn't point this out, it should be noted that the version of The Sound and the Fury published by LOA includes the "Appendix (Compson: 1699-1945)" which does not exist in all editions of the novel still in print. Although this Appendix was first published in 1945 as part of The Portable Faulkner (16 years after the novel itself was published), I always found it perverse and annoying that it was excluded from all but the Modern Library edition of the novel. (After all, if readers want the experience of reading the novel in the pristine form of the 1929 first edition, all they have to do is ignore the Appendix.)I don't know what else, if anything, of Faulkner's output LOA intends to publish going forward (short stories, screenplays, speeches, letters, poetry?), but these five volumes of novels contain (arguably?) the best works of American fiction by any author. Each volume is a handy size (though some contain four novels, they are all the size of one of Faulkner's novels as orinally published), and set in large and readable type. Buy them all and you can own all of Faulkner's best work without giving up three bookshelves to store them!

I was fascinated by the level of thinking that went into the movie FIGHT CLUB. It motivated me to read Palahniuk's novel which was the film's basis. The thinking, the cleverness, was there too. And though the novel was extreme, on the verge of being sci-fi or a futurist fable, there was something quite plausible about it as well. The emotional jadedness, the fear of emasculation, the fakery by which the nameless main character lived out his life all seemed quite authentic. I was genuinely intrigued by what Palahniuk had created and made a mental note to read more by this author.STRANGER THAN FICTION is a collection of articles written by Palahniuk for a variety of magazines. If you're fascinated by the "fight club" phenomenon, you'll find some satisfying glimpses into that story's little sojourn into Hollywoodland and the popular consciousness scattered among these articles. But even more so, STRANGER THAN FICTION offers glimpses into the absurdities, shallowness, and violence that constitute the end-of-the-millennium, life-in-America backdrop for that novel: the world of amateur wrestling ("Where Meat Comes From"), conferences where writers have seven minutes to pitch their stories to agents, publishers, or movie producers ("You Are Here"), a demolition derby in Washington State for combine drivers ("Demolition"), people obsessed with building medieval castles in the late 20th century U.S.A. ("Confessions in Stone"), users of steroids ("Frontiers"), the homoerotic nature of life on a submarine ("The People Can"), and an amateur rocket-maker seeking to win a ten million dollar prize being offered to the first private group to put a rocket into the atmosphere ("Human Error"). My favorite pieces, however, were the longer ones gathered in the "Portraits" section: actress Juliette Lewis ("In Her Own Words"), gay editor and political observer Andrew Sullivan ("Why Isn't He Budging?"), shock-artist Marilyn Manson ("Reading Yourself"), and Michelle Keating, a handler of rescue dogs ("Bodhisattvas"). What you get from Palahniuk consistently is a vision of people coping--one way or another, but coping nonetheless. And in an end-of-the millennium sort of way, this is the closest any of us is likely to get to hope. As Palahniuk says of himself in "Almost California", a self-mocking description of his visit to 20th Century Fox when FIGHT CLUB was in development, "That's why I write, because life never works except in retrospect. And writing makes you look back. Because you can't control life, at least you can control your version."

If there is any doubt that Ella Fitzgerald persuasively interpreted all the greatest American jazz and pop composers of the early and mid 20th century, then all one has to do is set aside a week or two to listen to all the disks in THE COMPLETE ELLA FITZGERALD SONG BOOKS. The songwriters she covers are: Cole Porter (35 songs); Rodgers and Hart (34); Duke Ellington (40); Irving Berlin (32); George and Ira Gershwin (59); Harold Arlen (28); Jerome Kern (12); Johnny Mercer (13). Fitzgerald's voice, the orchestrations, and the production qualities are uniformly great. The Cole Porter song book was my favorite when I owned most of these albums on vinyl, but the more I listen to each songbook the more I discover new jewels from each of the composers. Beautifully packaged using reproductions of the original album artwork and liner notes (you may want to purchase a magnifying glass), this boxed set also includes a 120-page hardcover book documenting the history of the songbooks. Many, many hours of pleasure are to be found in this little red box.

Kermode makes no bones about the fact that his interest in the Gospel of Mark is literary--not doctrinal, historical, or theological. These lectures from the late 1970s are still fresh and insightful. And they are as much an exploration of what it means to interpret a literary work as they are an examination of the Evangelist's text and methods. To do so he takes side-trips into Shakespeare, Joyce, Kafka, as well as into a little-known novel by Henry Green (&quot;Party Going&quot;). These are not idle excursions; Kermode's lectures are eloquent and tightly reasoned. In the end, his position is philosophical rather than aesthetic for he asserts that to live is to interpret. &quot;We glimpse the secrecy through the meshes of the text; this is divination, but what is divined is what is visible from our angle.... When we come to relate [the] part to the whole, the divined glimmer to the fire we suppose to be its source, we see why Hermes is the patron of so many other trades besides interpretation. There has to be trickery. And we interpret always as transients--of whom he is also patron--both in the book and in the world which resembles the book. For the world is our beloved codex.&quot; And like all good philosphical writing, Kermode's lectures are worth studying closely and reading over and over again.

The good news is FROM BAUHAUS TO OUR HOUSE (1981) is a quick and easy read; the bad news is it is over a quarter-century out-of-date. Wolfe gives a good overview of modern architecture which developed between the wars in Germany and the Netherlands (mostly), by men [sic] who fancied themselves champions of the worker, scoffed at bourgoisie cravings for ornament and comfort, migrated to the United States, and isolated themselves in academic compounds where they spent more time issuing manifestoes and striking poses than actually designing and building buildings. These academic architects, for all their Marxist ideology, seemed to care little for what the common worker wanted or needed. And they never embraced authentic modernist American architects, such as Frank Lloyd Wright [who broke two of the compound architects' sacred rules by (a) listening to his clients, and (b) actually having clients]. Wolfe's presentation is swift and impactful and his opinions will be gratifying to anyone who is baffled or bored with modern arctitecture. I'm not sure I am ready to dismiss all 20th century architecture so completely (I love the Seagrams Building, for instance).The book ends with a preliminary sketch and discussion of Philip Johnson's AT&T; building in New York City. This building with a top that is said to emulate that of a Chippendale highboy has since been built (long enough for its original tenant to have moved out) and New Yorkers have ceased to comment on it (indicating, I suppose, either acceptance or boredom). Michael Graves, whom Wolfe criticizes for doing lots of drawing and little building, has actually taken on commissions and produced buildings that are defining post-modernism (for more about these, the reader must resort to Google). I suspect Wolfe has continued to write articles on architecture; it would be nice if he could bring these together with a Second edition of FROM BAUHAUS TO OUR HOUSE.

What a powerful piece of drama! Incredible, powerhouse acting and brilliant writing--loaded with subtext. It's impossible to speak too highly of this 6-episode dramatic mini-series.This story focuses on seven of the jurors chosen to serve on an especially grisly murder trial (a Sikh teenager is accused of slaying a classmate with a ceremonial sword). These jurors are a mix of people, some are eager to serve (a woman in an emotionally stifling marriage; a single mom who is estranged from her mother, but who must ask her mother to care for her daughter while she serves on the jury; a lonely older woman with inoperable cancer; a married man whose powerful sense of civic duty is more than matched by a nagging sense of underachievement); some are reluctant (a seminary student who is unsure whether he wants to continue on his path to the priesthood; a recovering alcoholic just out of rehab; a married man who lost all his family's savings due to a bad business venture he was talked). The story, like the trial it revolves around, is a study of mixed motives, changes of heart, and living with fear. In the process of revealing each characters personal daily struggles we discover just how much of the human experience is comprised of learning to endure and deal with violence. In this drama we see the defendant and witnesses badgered by clever lawyers, friends manipulated by friends, and boundary-violating in-laws prying confidential information out of their son-in-law who is serving as a juror. Even the alcoholic's AA sponsor has a touch of the autocrat about him. And the young woman who has fled to jury duty as a way of creating an adventure for herself ends up using her womanly charms to manipulate a man into falling in love with her (even though she is fully aware that she is not free or capable of taking on a romantic relationship with him). I defy anyone to watch this compelling drama without questioning their own propensity to abuse power. We are all capable of being bullies. It's just a matter of circumstances and opportunity.

I'm a big fan of Alain de Botton's writing, so when I saw that his newest book, "The Architecture of Happiness" would not be released in the US until October 2006, I ordered it directly from Amazon.uk. I read it in two or three days and was not disappointed. Botton has a great way of connecting the writings and thoughts of the great minds of world civilization to everyday human experiences. In this case, to the kinds of buildings (public and private) we build or aspire to build, or conversely, tolerate and settle for. The book is amply illustrated. As nice as these photographs and illustrations are, Botton's writing is so precise and illustrative in its own right that the illustrations are not always necessary.In contrast to "The Art of Travel" and "The Consolations of Philosophy", Botton's new book does not rely on quotations from ancient and modern philosphers and theorists to make its points. Quotations are few, but apt. In compensation, though, I feel Botton is exposing the reader more directly to his own thoughts, observations, and assessments. He is less melancholic than in his earlier works; also, less clever and cute. He's as interesting as ever; just more authentic, exposed, and confident in his own voice. As I was reading I found that the sentences I wanted to underline were mostly Botton's own, not those of someone he was quoting. One of these should give you a good idea of where this book will take you: "We arrange around us material forms which communicate to us what we need--but are at constant risk of forgetting we need--within. We turn to wallpaper, benches, paintings and streets to staunch the disappearance of our true selves." (p. 107)It's hard to remain a sleepwalker after reading one of Alain de Botton's books. An they always bear re-reading. (A sticker on the cover of the book identifies "The Architecture of Happiness" as the inspiration of the TV series "The Perfect Home." I hope it's a show that gets picked up in the US or comes out on DVD.)

The New York Public Library and Oxford University Press conspired to develop a lecture series in which some of the most interesting modern minds ponder the most ancient human foibles: the Seven Deadly Sins. The lectures were given at the New York Public Library and the authors were permitted (encouraged?) to rework them for publication. Wasserstein's SLOTH and Robert Thurman's ANGER are the latest titles to join the series (ENVY and GLUTTONY were published in 2003; LUST and GREED in 2004; PRIDE is promised for this spring and hopefully will come before the fall).Although I've bought all of the available titles, I chose to read SLOTH first (always having had a soft spot for this sin). It is not surprising that Wasserstein, an accomplished playwright, chose to adopt a persona to convey her message-that of a sloth guru, the author of a anti-self-help book entitled "Sloth: And How to Get It." The guru is so slothful s/he hasn't gotten around to forming a clear or specific sexual identity (At college, "I played sports on both men's and women's teams, and I had also danced the young male and female lead in the New York City Ballet's Nutcracker"; p. 19) Anyone who has tried all the new diet books, attended a 12-step group, guiltily read PEOPLE at the supermarket check-out line, or gotten caught up in church/synagogue, school, or office politics, will enjoy the many jabs Wasserstein delivers to institutions and champions advocating perfectability. SLOTH has the potential to become a modern satirical classic like C.S. Lewis's THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS or Ambrose Bierce's THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY. However, unlike Lewis's great work, the jokes are mostly superficial, univalent, and very repetitive. It is, in the end, a one-joke book, and you could certainly accuse Wasserstein of taking enough trope to hang herself.My disappointment (why I only gave this very funny book only four stars), is that Wasserstein only occassionally reveals a serious concern with the nature and history of her chosen "sin." When I got to chapter three ("The Concise History of Sloth"), I thought that Wasserstein at last was going to start taking her subject seriously. And she does--for four pages (pp. 24 to 28), where she gives a very brief description of how "accedia" (originally understood as "sadness") was usurped in the seventeenth century by "sloth" on the Church's list of the Big Seven Sins. But wisdom can be found among the book's many flippancies. For instance, in her chapter on "Uberslothdom" she asserts, "True sloths are not revolutionaries...Sloths are the lazy guardians at the gate of the status quo" (p. 104). Hmmm.

I bought this DVD solely because I have always wanted to see this film ever since a friend told me it is Polankski's best. I found it especially disturbing, I think, because I saw it shortly after seeing "The Pianist." The social isolation of Polanski's character (a timid but clever young man who manages to take over the apartment of a dying woman even before she dies from injuries sustained in a suicide leap), the fascist-like brutality of the the neighbors, and the ever-growing maddening tension that pushes the film forward are all elements that Polanski used effectively once again in his more recent masterpiece. This juxtaposition made me think about how even the most mundane lives are small reflections of a vaster political landscape. Of course, one doesn't need to draw these comparisons to be blown away by "The Tenant." (In fact, the film has more obvious links to "Rosemary's Baby.") The film can be appreciated as a well-constructed, flawlessly acted (Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the concierge are great) suspense thriller. I highly recommend it.

...The book is comprised of letters exchanged by a New York-based American television script writer and various personnel at a small London bookshop where she prefers to buy all her books. The bookseller tolerates her insistance on paying in US currency and stoically endures her teasing and scolding when they send her a book that doesn't quite come up to her expectations. What comes across in this twenty year exchange of letters is the ease with which making and keeping friends is possible--if one only makes the effort. In the years immediately following World War II, Hanff saw that rationed food stuffs were sent to the shop so that they could be shared among the staff. The letters of thanks sent to Hanff and the enthusiasm with which the booksellers greeted friends of the author who happened to visit the shop when taking their vacations in England shows that their affection for their American friend was sincere and deep.Don't read this collection with the expectation that you will get an in-depth view of the characters' lives. Read it as a way of discovering how simple it is for human beings to drop their defenses and treat one another with respect, civility, humor, and openness. Read it when your hope for humanity is at its lowest."84, Charing Cross Road" reminded me of Jan Struther's "Mrs. Miniver." I believe "Mrs. Miniver" was originally published as a series of newspaper articles. When collected into a book, it was rightly or wrongly perceived as a novel. Readers who see it as a novel usually have complaints about it's structure and seeming lack of plot (if this is what you desire, you can always rent the movie). Read as a collection of finely crafted observations of daily life in England during World War II, it's a moving tribute to the strength and durability of the human spirit. "Miniver" and "84, Charing Cross Road" make great back-to-back reads.

The thing about Nick Hornby you have to appreciate on some level, is that he's a true lover of music--not classics, but the stuff your contemporaries listen to and use as a litmus test to decide who they can let into their little circle of friends and who needs to be kept out at all costs. Hornby is one of the more generous and forgiving of these people. I don't get most of what he writes about music and consequently have been postponing reading his first novel HIGH FIDELITY (though I enjoyed the movie enough). The title of this collection of book reviews is Hornby's name for the group of editors at THE BELIEVER, the magazine in which they first appeared. It is a reference to a recording group known as The Polyphonic Spree. I've stalked them on the Web, heard some clips, and they remind me of the early Beatles mixed in with the Cowsills and the cast of Godspel (kinda groovy, ya know). I can imaging Horby hating them...or loving them. That's what I mean, you have to be into contemporary music to get where Hornby is much of the time. I suspect though that his editors don't feel flattered by this comparison.When he's talking about books, and people, and the human condition, I find him much easier to read. The POLYSYLLABIC SPREE is worth its purchase price just for his rabid defense of book-buying. Each month's review opens with two lists: the books he BOUGHT that month, and the books he READ. And he's definitely not a tourist in the land of Buying-and-Reading. His description of how one book leads you into another (a partial explanation to friends as to why he doesn't just read everything he owns before buying more), is right on the money. His love/hate relationship with "the little literary novel" is especially gratifying to be party to. Of one literary novel he abandoned mid-month, he writes, "I got halfway through before its quietness and lack of truth started to get me down. I don't mind nothing happening in a book, but nothing happening in a phony way--characters saying things people never say, doing jobs that don't fit, the whole works--is simply asking too much of a reader." What's great about Horby as a reviewer is that he says things you always thought, but considered a little unfair and harsh. Hornby gives these harsh opinions credibility and weight. Coming from him, these opinions sound like confident Supreme Court decisions with no room for dissenting opinions. Even when he's writing about books I never intend to sign out of the library (let alone increase the size of my own by purchasing a copy), he has shrewd things to say about genres, marketing, pop culture, and the way we read.Another thing I like about THE POLYSYLLABIC SPREE is that it reads a bit like someone playing the academic game "Humiliation" in which literature professors go around the room and admit which major classic of Western Literature she or he has still not read and for which they are (presumably) truly ashamed (mine's REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST). For instance, Hornby admits to getting around to reading J.D. Salinger's slight corpus a little later in life than the usual Salinger fan. I guess when it comes to reading schedules and reading lists, "should" has always been the operative word. What we read and how much time we choose to set aside to have our world views challenged or coaxed along by complete (though hopefully, well-informed) strangers is, at its foundation, a moral matter. I like that Horby makes me think about this.

If you're a fan of Tennessee Williams this triptych is a great bargain. The strongest of the three is "Eccentricities of a Nightingale" (a reworking of "Summer and Smoke" and one which Williams preferred to his earlier effort). Danner and Langella are brilliant. The sexual frankness these two characters exhibit may seem implausible for their social setting and the era being depicted, but somehow it works. It's as if Williams is presenting us with a hypothetical: "What if people could be honest with one another about their sexual desires and what if they were willing to engage one another in fulfilling these desires without burdening each other with unrealistic expectations?" Watching Danner's Alma is like seeing what might have become of Blanche DuBois if she had not lost her connection to reality and if Stanley had loved her and not just used her. "Dragon Country" is two short plays about conflicted couples. The DVD is worth the purchase price just for Kim Stanley's subtle performance in part 2, "I Can't Imagine Tomorrow." It's easy to see why she was such a major stage actor; it's a pity she didn't make more films. The only disappointment in this set was "Ten Blocks on the Camino Real," which feels like an amateurish high school production. The story is told on a mythic level which makes it difficult to take any of the characters seriously--in trying to present them archetypes Williams has created wooden stereotypes. This one will probably be of interest only to the person intent upon seeing everything Williams wrote. Even so, the cost of the set is less than buynig any two of the DVDs separately.

De Botton seems to have given his new book, like two of his previous volumes (HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE and THE CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY), a self-satirizing title. But like those earlier works, THE ART OF TRAVEL exhibits a strong belief in the ability of art, observation, and thinking about art to make a difference on how one experiences one's own life and place in the world. His interest in "stay-at-home" artists, first evidenced in his study of Proust, continues. THE ART OF TRAVEL is comprised of nine chapters. The first ("On Anticipation") uses the disappointment of the decadent aesthete "hero" of J.K. Huysmans's novel A REBOURS as the basis of an exploration of why the experience of travel never seems to match our expectations (at least for those of us who are well-read). Huysmans's Parisian hero had a hankering to see London after reading a Dickens novel, made preparations for his trip, but got no further than an English tavern in Paris when he "was abruptly overcome by lassitude." In the final chapter ("On Habit") de Botton identifies an author who takes Huysmans's and Proust's approach to travel to the extreme--Xavier de Maistre. The work is JOURNEY AROUND MY BEDROOM. (The man and the book exist; I checked the Internet.) De Botton, in his humorously endearing way tries to follow de Maistre's example...but his bedroom is too small (and too crowded with books, I might add...He gives us a photograph.) Instead, he uses his immediate neighborhood as a basis for seeing what there is to see when one makes up one's mind to notice the details one would notice (without prompting) in more exotic locales. Sandwiched between these two chapters are excellent essays based on an examination of the works and world views of Charles Baudelaire & Edward Hopper ("On Traveling Places"); Gustave Flaubert ("On the Exotic"); the detail obsessed Alexander von Humboldt ("On Curiosity"); the ever-peripatetic William Wordsworth ("On the Country and the City"); Edmund Burke and the anonymous author of JOB ("On the Sublime"); the late-blooming but revolutionary artist Vincent van Gogh ("On Eye-Opening Art"); and the highly articulate artist John Ruskin ("On Possessing Beauty"). As with de Botton's earlier books, there will be those who feel he has been too superficial in his examination of his sources and too quick to see their application for our lives today. But I disagree. I find that he gives the reader plenty to think about without burdening us with too much analysis. He gives us the box and opens the lid. It's the reader's job to make the connections and explore the contents.If nothing else, this book left me with the desire to read van Gogh's letters (which I own) and anything by Ruskin (which I don't own but will certainly start looking for on Amazon.com; I found Ruskin's observation about the twin purposes of art to be as true today as when he noted them: to make sense of pain and to fathom the sources of beauty, p. 233.)

A brilliant film by Jim Tushinski about a fascinating and unforgetable gay icon. Peter Berlin with his chisled abs, smooth skin, Dutchboy haircut, exaggerated (and self-altered) wardrobe, and unflinching gaze epitomized the boldness and sexual freedom that marked gay life in New York and San Francisco in the years immediately following Stonewall. Often referred to as a porn star, he surprisingly only made two erotic films. But like a true icon, he is remembered more for his still images--photographs taken by Robert Mapplethorp or himself, posters and newspaper ads for his movies, and drawings by Tom of Finland. Some of the most fascinating of these still images are the double exposures he took of himself in which, Narcissus like, he seems to be trying to seduce himself. He was extremely conscious of his ability to attract attention and managed to project both an androgynous and hyper-masculine image. Madonna could learn a lot from him should she ever deign to emerge from whatever glen she is lurking in.Tushiinski does a great job of blending a generous amount of vintage film footage showing Berlin in his heyday with insightful interview clips from people like Armistead Maupin, Jack Wrangler, Wakefield Poole, and John Waters. Skillfully interwoven with these are interview clips with Berlin himself, alive and well and living in San Francisco. At 60, he dresses the same and looks, well, like an older version of himself. Berlin is comfortable talking about himself and needs no prompting from the director. He even provides the voice-over for much of the film. He speaks about his interactions with Andy Warhol and Mapplethorpe, his inability to make any real money, and his close friends who died from "the virus." (His own HIV-negative status is probably attributable to the fact that he enjoyed exhibitionism and seduction more than actual sex.) He is not in denial about growing old. He's honest about his regrets but is neither bitter nor overwhelmed by them. He is and always has been apolitical (declining to be grand marshall of San Francisco's gay pride parade). It's hard to say why he remains such a fascinating figure. Perhaps we just admire (and envy) his unflagging, unrepentent self-love.This DVD has lots of extras, including a gallery of many of those wonderful still images. The director's commentary is way above average. Fascinating stuff, from beginning to end!

In defending the use of the name "Old Testament" for the Scriptures Christians inherited from Jews (by way of the Septuagint), van Buren makes an elegant argument for a dual reading of those works that both Jews and Christians hold sacred. "What we can and must object to, however, was the growing conviction of the church that those scriptures were originally, and so exclusively, addressed to them. In its place we have argued for a dual reading of those texts, a reading that reflects God's preservation of both the Jewish people and the Christian church as bearers of Israel's story into the future" (p. 131).He builds his argument on Jewish and Christian understandings of the aqedah, the Binding of Isaac, and concludes his volume with fresh readings of the stories of Sarah's appeal to Abraham to expel Hagar and Ishmael (Genesis 21); Esau's discovery that he has been robbed of his blessing (Genesis 27); and the New Testament story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15).Nowhere does van Buren argue for political correctness. In fact, as he presented his reasons for mutually respectful Jewish and Christian readings of the same texts I kept wondering why Christians hadn't taken this position earlier (and I mean centuries earlier). I suspect some Christians will be less convinced. But as for me, my reading of the Old Testament has changed forever.

Beautifully conceived and beautifully executed, this is truly and amazing DVD! The two-sided disk contains eight half-hour visits to the world's most beautiful gardens, plus eighty minutes of great music-only tracks, and two great behind-the-scenes segments showing Ms Hepburn at her most charming and personable.I bought this DVD because I'm a Hepburn fan and her participation in this project certainly lends the entire undertaking a touch of class. She introduces each segment, reads poetry (and Anne Frank), converses with gardeners, and makes observations of her own--usually as she drifts in or out of the picture wearing elegant Ralph Lauren outfits and swinging a straw basket or plucking a bloom or two. (Watching the episodes in quick succession, I realized how true it is that she always favors her left profile.) In some episodes, however, she is barely on screen at all. As these shows were taped the year before her death, I suspect her participation was limited by the state of her health and that she was not able to fly to every location.Although the shows would have been much poorer without Ms Hepburn, they are substantial in their own right. I found the episode on &quot;Tulips and Spring Bulbs&quot; especially informative. The bulk of the script, it should be noted, fell into the lap of the narrator, Michael York. He rose to the occasion as best he could, but some of the text he was expected to read was surely not written to be read aloud by any human being. (One amusing moment occurred when Mr. York, using his best Oxonian English, referred to George Washington as &quot;OUR founding father.&quot;)The theme that seemed to run through all the episodes is that gardening is a delicate collaboration between man and nature. As Ms Hepburn states, quoting gardener Anne Leighton (?), &quot;A garden, to be a garden, must represent a different world, however small, from the real world....Gardening offers man a chance to regulate at least one aspect of his life--to control his environment and show himself as he wishes to be.&quot;

While some may take this to be a one-joke book (wooing an international tourist economy by recreating all of England's most famous, market-tested landmarks into a more manageable, mini-England on the Isle of Wight), I find it to be a clever lens through which the reader can observe and consider the foibles of modern Western (not just British) society. On the way it raises many interesting questions: What is the role of memory in personal and national identities? Why and how do we seek to exercise control over others? How are we shaped by the roles we assume (regardless of our motives for accepting these roles)? When is what we choose to believe about reality more powerful than reality itself? And let's not forget, What is the role of sex in history?While this book by Julian Barnes does not have any of the understated poignancy that I enjoyed and expected to find after reading FLAUBERT'S PARROT, it is clever and engaging in its own way. A fun read if you can handle the artifice.

Professor Ehrmann has assembled a nice collection of Christian (orthodox and heterodox) writings from the period immediately following the New Testament and before the Council of Nicea. Although these are not brand new translations and all are readily available in other collections, the easy-to-read double column textbook format, the thematic way the texts are categorized, and the brief, helpful introductions make this anthology well worth its price. This volume and Ehrmann's other anthology THE NEW TESTAMENT AND OTHER EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITINGS are essential companions to his THE NEW TESTAMENT: A HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION TO THE EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITINGS.On the frustrating side, there is much overlap between Ehrmann's two anthologies--in fact, I ended up buying them both because it was too much trouble to compare the tables of contents to see which volume included more non-New Testament works. Also somewhat disappointing was the fact that there are no bibliographic references to the supplied texts (each chapter introduction concludes with a short list of general topic books &quot;For Further Reading&quot;). I would, at least, like to know if there are other respected translations or commentaries in print on any of these texts. Another oddity: The Didache is split into three parts and presented out of sequence (with the document's brief chapter 6 being omitted altogether). This is not inappropriate, considering that Ehrmann has arranged his texts topically so readers can read significant key documents in relation to one another (such as, The Structure of Early Christianity [Did ch 11-15]; The Development of the Liturgy [Did 7-10]; Leading the Upright Life [Did 1-5]).This is a nice, handy collection of key texts that I'm sure I'll return to over and over, especially as I read other books about the beginnings of the early Church.

In this documentary, British filmmaker Ron Peck reflects on his effort to make the 1970s gay cult classic film NIGHTHAWKS. But this documentary is a multi-layered thing. It is Peck's personal perspective of coming to terms with his own homosexuality as a youth; it is a reflection on the emergence of a gay liberation movement in the US and Britain; it is an expose on censorship, sexual politics, and the sexual mores of the gay community. Not having seen NIGHTHAWKS, I found STRIP JACK NAKED a little hard to follow at first. Peck's style for this film is to have a running commentary (himself presumably) to a rather free-floating collage of images and film clips. I wanted to know who in the film clips was supposed to be representing Peck/the narrator. But not knowing seems, in part, to be the point. In some cases the "I" is a picture of Peck as a school boy; in others, it is the "school teacher" character from NIGHTHAWKS (who, of course, was based on Peck...so the distinctions are moot). I felt as though this blending of personas was a statement in itself: while each gay person in the 60s and 70s travelled a lonely path to self-discovery, their exerpiences were astonishingly similar. Because NIGHTHAWKS was Peck's first feature-length film and funding sources were few and far between, it took many years to come to completion. And Peck notes that by the time the film was released, the gay liberation movement has already had its effect. Large scale discos catering to gay clientele had replaced the smokey little clubs that were part of Peck's coming out experience and which served as the primary setting of NIGHTHAWKS. Peck gives the viewer (especially gay viewers) much to think about. It is a reflection on dark times but is neither dismal nor depressing. His comments about himself as a gay person and filmmaker are frank and clear-eyed. He is neither narcissistic nor self-flagelating. He is both rational and wise.A nice treat on this DVD is the short film "What Can I Do with a Nude Male." This film, too, consists of running commentary (from a fictional physique photographer) over a series of images (in this case, of the model in various cliched, masculinist attires and poses). The monologue is brilliant, on the level of Alan Bennett. And the model...well, let's just say you'll want to keep your remote handy.

Riveting high energy interpretation of one of Shakespeare's more problematic comedies. The director's decision to present this somewhat sexist comedy as an over-the-top commedia dell'arte production was brilliant. Patruchio's use of physical violence to tame his headstrong finacee is somehow made tolerable because all the relationships in this play are embued with violence. And like characters in a Roadrunner cartoon, victims bounce back with vigor and always manage to give as good as they get. The troupe is incredibly in sync with one another, highly athletic, and incredibly gifted at reciting their iambic pentameter flawlessly while being twirled overhead or kicked in the groin. It really has to be seen to be believed. And who knew Marc Singer, the Beastmaster, could act?! In the end, he brings a subtlety to his part that leaves you wondering who's taming whom?Harold Clurmann's interview with the director is a nice DVD extra.

Paglia has clearly retreated from the limelight and is doing what she does best: teaching. You can argue with the book's subtitle (her pick of the world's best poems all happen to have been written in English); you can argue with her choices (at least when she gets into the late 20th century); and you can argue with the specifics of her analyses (she identifies Ralph Pomeroy's use of the word "craver" as a misprint for "craker," a type of crow); but you can't argue with her passion and commitment to careful, line-by-line reading of poetry. All of the poems discussed are short lyric poems which are reprinted in the volume (so you don't have to hunt them down). Most poems warrant 3 to 6 pages of discussion. Paglia does not ramble or reflect idly. These short essays are dense but lively, and clearly the distillation of many years' worth of teaching notes. Every sentence is a gem. Paglia provides biographical information on the poets' lives, but is not quick to assume that when a poet writes in the first person s/he is speaking about her/himself. On the other hand, where poets freight their works with many personal references, as Frank O'Hara does in "A Mexican Guitar," she acknowledges this fact while giving the reader permission to find delight in them without ever expecting to unlock all their mysteries. Her reading of Sylvia Plath's "Daddy" is worth the price of the book.I have despaired of ever seeing volume 2 of SEXUAL PERSONAE, where Paglia promised to go deeper into discussion of film and pop culture. But I was glad to have come across this little volume of thoughtful literary criticism. She definitely has renewed my interest in the Metaphysical poets, Whitman, Dickinson, Williams, and Roethke, among others.

There is little here of the pinched discomfort of educated middle-class white folk painfully disengaged from their own lives that distinguished Leavitt's first and most insightful short story collection, FAMILY DANCING. But there is still evidence that Leavitt is a keen observer of human behavior and modern life. (Although he sometimes sets his stories in another time period, I find it easiest to surrender to the ones that are firmly set in the present--even if that "present" spans a couple of decades, as in the title story of this collection.) He continues to reference the detritus of modern life (Filofax datebooks, email, automatic pool cleaners), but he does this selectively and, unlike Bret Easton Ellis and others of their generation, he does not overwhelm his readers with brand names and expect us to understand the relative prestige of every product named. His focus is on the workings of the human heart and will, though the social context of his characters is never out of sight. For me, his approach to story telling falls somewhere between that of de Maupassant and Checkhov.Leavitt experiments in post-modern story telling in "Route 80," a two-part self-reflexive story about a pair of lovers who have broken up; "Speonk," a story with three possible endings about a recently retired soap opera star's efforts to reach the small town of Speonk on eastern Long Island one night and the way his daytime drama personality does (or does not) draw reactions from the people he encounters on the way; and "The List," a modern epistolary story told entirely through the emails exchanged by gay academics, some of whom have never met.By far the most post-modern story in this collection is "The Infection Scene," the story of two young gay men who make a pact to have unprotected sex so that the uninfected partner can share in his lover's impending doom from AIDS, interwoven with a fictionalized historical account of Alfred Lord Douglas's equally destructive relationship with Oscar Wilde. The contemporary story has the ghoulishness of an urban legend while the historical story seems too confident of its own grasp of the facts to be believable. The ultimate effect (which I suspect is intentional) is to leave the reader questioning the validity and plausibility of any story. As cynical as it may seem, stories, Leavitt seems to be saying, can ultimately do little more than amuse. They cannot teach anything, reveal anything, or guide us through life. You, gentle reader, are what you choose to believe.This theme also dominates the best story in the collection, "Black Box." Here, using very traditional story-telling techniques, Leavitt chooses one metaphor (the search for fallen commercial jet's black box) to hover in the background of his story. Although certainly written before 9/11/01, it addresses the Grand Guignol aspects of human behavior that have come to the fore since the terrorist attacks of that tragic day. One senses that the lives of people caught up in the numbing banality of modern life are so devoid of meaning that there is an almost romantic surrendering to tragedy and horror. As one character observes, "It's curious how hungry, almost lustful, people get for details. Especially if there's some horrible irony, like the person had just missed another plane" (p. 101). The question seems to be, where do people turn to find meaning and from what do we manufacture it?Overall, a decent and thoughtful collection of stories, though not as unified and stunning as FAMILY DANCING.

Albom's TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE was such a good book because it was a true account of the author's relationship with a dying mentor. The best parts of FOR ONE MORE DAY are the short chapters entitled "Times My Mother Stood Up for Me" and "Times I Did Not Stand Up for My Mother" that Albom intersperses among the chapters relating the fictional story of an alcoholic ex-baseball player who tried to commit suicide. These interleaved chapters (at least some of them, anyway) are based on actual events from the author's relationship with his own (still living) mother according to what he has said in interviews and in pod-casts promoting the book. I think readers would have been better served had he planted them within a different, more personal narrative. I'm sure many sons (and daughters) could identify with what these short chapters express--the regret for the times they have resisted a parent's best-intended (but mostly failed) efforts to make the children they brought into the world feel better about themselves. The imagined story of a man in a hallucinatory stupor experiencing another ordinary day with his deceased mother comes across as a little corny and seems to disrespect the authentic feelings conjured up by the author's personal recollections. One wonders if the recent bruhaha over Frey's A MILLION LITTLE PIECES didn't scare Albom away from covering this material as a true memoir. The book, on the other hand, is brief and uplifting if read in the spirit the author obviously intended. I loved TUESDAYS and will probably take a peek at THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN, Albom's second and equally well-received book. Albom's voice is a cheery alternative in this age of cynicism, doom, and gloom. And long-winded, he's not.

Mercifully, the &quot;chips&quot; (as in &quot;fish 'n' chips&quot;) is downplayed in this well written, finely acted, high-energy period drama. The period in question is Swingin' England in 1965. The locale, working-class Manchester (in the beginning) and London (second half). The story focuses on a rivalrous pair of twin sisters coming out of high school, full of dreams and eager to buck the iron rule of their controlling grandmother...and their encounter with a soon-to-be discovered rock and roll band. The gals and the guys get equal treatment here, but clearly we are expected to delight in the way the young women come into their own in a proto-feminist kind of way. More than anything the women are caught between the need to live out their dreams and the downward pull of the family motto, &quot;'I want' does not get.&quot; But it's not as glum as you might expect. The 60s British music adds pep and relief from some otherwise tense melodrama. Not entirely plausible, it has a some of the compensatory artificiality of &quot;Strictly Ballroom.&quot; Loads of fun. All it lacked was some walk-on parts for people like Alan Bates, Albert Finney, and Julie Christie.

Although this, the first of Baz Luhrmann's triptych of &quot;Red Curtain&quot; movies, lacks the flashy special effects of Moulin Rouge (the third), it is emotionally the most honest and engaging of the three. (The middle film, Romeo and Juliet, is the weakest, silliest, and downright boring.) But what's clear from Strictly Ballroom is that Luhrmann and his cohorts (the choreographer and production designer he badgers and constantly interrupts on the commentary track) love to dazzle and douse us in saturated colors. Theatrical artificiality dominates every decision they made. Ballroom succeeds (moreso than Moulin Rouge even) because the importance of this artificiality is challenged...by the love story, by the peasant earthiness of the leading woman's Spanish family, and by the earnestness of the hero's commitment to his own dream--to bring something new and truly his own to his own little world, the highly codified and insular world of ballroom dancing.The only disappointment (and it's a minor one) is that the commentary track was apparently done at or around the same time as the commentary tracks of Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge. More attention is given to production details (and kvetching about the things they couldn't do because of the limited budget) and less about the story itself.

Four young ladies(one a bit more of a trollop than the others)looking for love without sacrificing their personal identities--part comedy, part "serious" drama. Sound familiar? WHERE THE BOYS ARE could have been the mould HBO used to create its hit series SEX AND THE CITY. But the year is 1960, so the language is not so rough and the sex happens off screen. I was pleased with how well this almost 45-year-old movie has held up (for the most part). It has some of the big-studio hallmarks (like the way women's wardrobes happen to coordinate nicely with the colors of the rooms they just happen to be in at the moment). But the lead actresses--Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, Paula Prentiss, and Connie Francis--are very appealing. This was Paula Prentiss's first picture (she provides a commentary track that is more gushy and nostalgic than informative), and her star quality is evident. Their male counterparts--George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, and Frank Gorshen--are less magnetic, but at least they don't wreck the movie. While you might want to pass on the commentary track, don't skip the featurette with Prentiss and Francis sharing their memories. (Dolores Hart, by the way, is now a mother superior at a convent somewhere in Connecticut. Hmmmm?)A fine film, still enjoyable these many years later.

This film is best appreciated if you take time to recognize what it is NOT. It is not an expose of the dark side of gay life in the 60s (think Dirk Bogarde in "The Victim," 1961); it is not a frivolous or slick Hollywood "coming out" story (a la "In and Out"); nor is it painfully earnest like so many independent films by gay directors. The film is simply a look into the life of a gay school teacher (Jim) in London in the mid-seventies (though I suspect it could have been shot in New York, San Francisco, or Sydney and been just as credible). Jim's days consist of making reasonable efforts to manage a classroom of unruly teens; his evenings are spent going to bars and discotheques where he connects (with varying degrees of success) with other gay men. There is a redundancy to this scenario that modern movie-goers may have little patience for ("Okay, we get it!" I can hear them screaming at their TV screens), but I found the repetition to be important. The teacher continues Sisyphus-like to make the daily efforts to meet someone. There are scenes in bars that seem to go on forever. Like Jim, we see nothing but a wall of men dancing together to endless dance club music. There are shots that last three or more minutes where the camera focuses solely on the Jim's eyes as they scan the room. Is this desperation? or patience and optimism? Viewers will clearly interpret such scenes based on their own histories and perspectives. Another recurring scene is of Jim driving his previous night's guest to the tube or their place of work. These scenes, too, can be seen as either depressingly repetitive or satirically comical. ("Oh, the things we tell one another the morning after," I said to myself. "Who do we think we are fooling?) The writer-director Ron Peck is clearly in command of his subject material. This is not Warhol's "Chelsea Girls" where the camera was kept running for no particular reason. As a viewer, you are confident that something is going on in this quiet and highly textured film. Those who can surrender to the film's rhythms will get something out of it. There are at least three stories unfolding here. There's the story of a gay man looking for a relationship; the story of a teacher willing to expose his personal life to his students if it will make a difference in their lives; and there is the story of a man's relationship with a needy fellow teacher (who happens to be a woman who probably has a crush on him, but clearly is uncertain how to process what she is learning about her colleague's lifestyle). In the end, the teacher seems to be a valiant soul, keeping it together and struggling, as all souls must, to play the hand he has been dealt.Although there are no DVD extras, Peck did do a follow-up film that is also worth looking at ("Strip Jack Naked," 1991).

Most people know whether they want to read the NY Times or not. This is a review of the Kindle edition. Besides the crossword puzzle, the Kindle edition lacks ads (yea!), classifieds and paid death notices (okay by me), political cartoons (tant pis), and many photographs and charts (but not all). While I've tried to find cheaper Kindle alternatives (and they exist), nothing compares to the NY Times for news coverage, especially if you're a resident of New York State and lack a good local newspaper (in print format or on-line). The lack of photos is usually only a problem in the Home, Science, and Style sections when you're trying to make sense of articles that frequently reference them. The inclusion of political cartoons should be fixable (is anyone listening?). I really appreciate being able to skim the tables of contents to each section so that I can do triage and properly plan how much time I can devote to reading the paper each day. I also like being able to easily read an article to completion without having to hunt out its conclusion in another section. One other improvement I'd like to recommend is that the NY Times editors provide readers with a word count for each article, as so many Kindle papers and magazines do, so I can decide if I have the time to read it before beginning my workday or postpone it until I have more time. This seems like an easy fix and something Kindle readers should be able to expect, given the price of the subscription. (The progress bar at the bottom of the Kindle screen, by the way, doesn't monitor the reader's progress through individual articles, but rather through sections of the paper...not very valuable from my perspective.) One other observation--inexplicably sometimes a news article (often an obituary) gets dropped from the Kindle edition. This doesn't seem intentional, but it happens. But all in all, I'm very happy reading the NY Times on my Kindle.PS, for those who miss the Puzzle, the Kindle does offer some free word games you can download.

As evidenced in the many versions of APOCALYPSE NOW and THE GODFATHER (I, II, and III), Francis Ford Coppola never stops fussing his movies. With the release of THE OUTSIDERS: THE COMPLETE NOVEL, Coppola has restored 22 minutes (mostly prologue) to his 1983 all-star teen hit. What do these extra minutes add to the film? Well, you could say the relationship of the three Curtis brothers (played by Swayze, Lowe, and Howell) is more sharply defined. Interestingly, in the original version it was the middle child (Lowe's Sodapop Curtis) who got pushed to the margins. In the new version with restored footage, viewers get to see quite a bit of this Emmy award winning actor's earliest screen acting. One key scene, a bedtime conversation between Lowe and Howell was cut, according to Coppola's commentary, because it caused snickering in previews. While it is interesting to watch and although it certainly provided information helpful to understanding the brothers' relationship, even the original theatrical version of THE OUTSIDERS did not lack for scenes of fraternal tenderness. In fact, many of the cut scenes involved one or another of the male characters breaking down and having some kind of confessional confrontation with his feelings. These guys are supposed to be "greasers" after all. Having fewer emotional displays actually makes the few that remain all the more impactful.The other big change was the virtual jettisoning of Coppola pere's lush, "Hollywoody" score, and its replacement with sizeable chunks of the early Elvis catalog. Coppola had originally conceived of THE OUTSIDERS as a sort of teen GONE WITH THE WIND, and it worked. The addition of long stretches of rockabilly music, to my ear, was distracting, and at times it even undermined key dialogue.Do I prefer the original OUTSIDERS to THE COMPLETE NOVEL version? Yes. Do I regret buying THE COMPLETE NOVEL version? Absolutely not! There are so many delightful extras on this two-disk set. Almost all of the stars, most of whom have gone on to do great things, provided interview clips and/or commentary (notably missing were Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruz, who had smaller parts, anyway). One of my favorite extras was the tour of Tulsa given by S.E. Hinton, the author of the bestselling young adult novel the movie was based on. Also fun to watch were tapes from the original auditions, including footage of people who didn't make it into the movie. I've always been a fan of this movie and enjoyed learning from the creative participants themselves what went into the making of it. But if I want an emotional catharsis, it's the original theatrical version I'll pop into the DVD player. (By the way, I also prefer the three separate Godfather movies to the chronologically restored mini-series.)

This book consists of three lectures given by Professor Rybczynski at the New York Public Library (lectures he admits to revising for publication based on the need to respond to challenging questions from his audience). While not as innovative in topic and scope of inquiry as his books "Home" and "Waiting for the Weekend," there is much here that Rybczynski's loyal readers will recognize and appreciate--the author's love of his subject, his deep and broad knowledge of the history of architecture, his high regard for the minutia others tend to dismiss, and his confidence in his own opinion. The three essays--"Dressing Up," "In and Out of Fashion," and "Style"--are an investigation, among other things, of archtects' reluctance to speak of their work in terms of style. "Architects don't like to talk about style," Rybczynski says in his introduction. "Ask an architect what style he works in and you are likely to be met with a pained expression, or with silence." (p. xi). The lectures explore the differences between arcitecture and other art forms (including interior design, cooking, and the rag trade). Of the distinction between style and fashion, he says, "If style is the language of architecture, fashion represents the wide--and swirling--cultural currents that shape and direct that language." (p. 51) In the end, Rybczynski observes, "A suspicion of style is a heritage of the Modern Movement, which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion, while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency." (p. 109) He also attributes the reluctance to speak in terms of style to archtects' fears (but I'll let you ferret out the provocative supporting quotations for yourself). The lectures are well-seasoned with aphorisms, and I found myself often lowering the book to my lap and pondering individual statements for minutes at a time as if in conversation with the author. I will leave you with just one more of these statements, "The role of details is not to complement architecture; details ARE archticture." (p. 94) All in all, I found "The Look of Architecture" to be a very enjoyable read.

I guess I liked this book because it confirms a suspicion I've been harboring during most of my thirty years of enthusiastic Bible reading--that the authors of the Hebrew Bible weren't as original as the Christian (and I suspect Jewish) community would like to believe. Although this book may for some readers dim the halo on the Sacred Text, Malchow is not on a debunking crusade. He simply points out how much of what is found in the Bible is remarkably similar to what can be found in many different kinds of texts (legal, liturgical, sapiential) common to the Ancient Near East. Nor does he waste much ink trying to prove direct dependencies. In fact, wasting ink and killing trees is the last thing you could accuse him of doing. At 88 pages (counting the introduction and bibliography), this is a lean volume that gets right to the point. It has helpful chapters on &quot;Law Codes&quot;, &quot;The Prophetic Books,&quot; &quot;The Psalms,&quot; &quot;Late Narrative Works,&quot; and &quot;The Wisdom Literature.&quot; If Malchow's statement that much of the biblical literature was written by a privileged elite (including many of the prophets) is true, it is both astonishing and gratifying that these people so often spoke out against their own class and on behalf of the poor and marginalized. This is a book I plan to hold on to and read again and again.

This book, written primarily for Anglicans/Episcopalians, is a concise and wonderful answer to Christians who give the Bible too much prominence in their faith-life, those who are perhaps guilty of practicing &quot;Bibliolatry.&quot; Without disrespecting the Good Book, Johnston speaks about the importance of reading the Bible within the context of a community of faith, and like communities of faith, the Bible is a living and ever-changing thing. I especially appreciated the distinction he draws between reading the Bible literally, historically, and prophetically. And anyone who considers the Bible to be a sacred text needs to read it in all three senses. Reading the Bible literally means to read exactly what's on the page (not to read into it things you remember for Sunday School or Christmas pageants)--to see it with fresh eyes. To read it historically means to be reasonably curious about the story behind the scene and to be willing to do a little background research to better understand the context of these ancient texts. And to explore the Bible in its prophetic sense is to be willing to understand what the text has to say about the way we apply the lessons of the Bible and live out our own lives today. One statement Johnston makes that I will continue to ponder for some time is, &quot;Bible readers in Christian communities do not so much need experts as they do adepts, skilled readers who can both instruct and inspire with their own passion for the Bible&quot; (p. 40).The last three chapters (&quot;Who is the God of the Bible?&quot;, &quot;Who is the Jesus of the Bible?&quot;, and &quot;The Word as Sacrament&quot;) are especially thought-provoking. ENGAGING THE WORD is volume three in a twelve-part series called &quot;The New Church's Teaching Series.&quot; Volume 2, OPENING THE BIBLE by Robert Ferlo, is also worth reading and deals with more practical issues about what Christians should know in order to begin a meaningful and satisfying practice of reading the Bible.

It's nice to see a simple story told well and beautifully acted. There are no explosions or audience-baiting Hollywood touches in this quiet film--unless you account Bancroft's throwing a copy of Pepys diary across the room because it was "only excerpts, not the real thing." The only liberty I felt the filmmakers took with Helene Hanff's collection of personal correspondence with a British bookstore was to imply that she was carrying a torch for her primary correspondent, Frank Doel (played by Hopkins). While any relationship can be see as tinged with erotic tensions of some sort, I always felt from the book that Helene had a good grasp on reality (an opinionated and driven New Yorker, yes, but one that I doubt would ever have seriously endeavored to cross the Atlantic in hopes of busting up Frank's marriage.) In fact, Hanff never reveals much about her personal life in the book. (Perhaps she married but the fact was never documented in her correspondence.) The movie has her surrounded by numerous coupled friends, perhaps unintentionally supporting the stereotype that bookish women are asexual and unlovable. But Bancroft resists this stereotype and presents Helene as a vital and engaging personality. There is nothing pathetic about her.One amusing moment in the film was seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Judy Dench as Mr. and Mrs. Doel watching the coronation of Elizabeth II on their black and white television...the very queen who would one day bestow titles on these two accomplished actors.Although it would have been nice if the film had been put on DVD in widescreen format, it probably doesn't matter that much. There are no sweeping vistas here, nor are there many scenes of two characters sitting across a table and conversing with one another. (In fact, they have the entire Atlantic Ocean between them.) Pan and scan works just fine.This film will not be everyone's cup of tea, but for anyone who enjoys watching a couple of veteran actors playing everyday people with great subtlety, this makes for a very pleasant 100 minutes.

From MOLL FLANDERS to PRETTY WOMAN, the fascination with the world's oldest profession shows no signs of waning. Rick Whitaker's account of his brief stint as a sex professional servicing male clientele is an honest, if slight (a mere 179 pages, with lots of white space) addition to this ever-expanding body of literature. I say &quot;honest&quot; provisionally because I believe it was Whitaker's intention to be as frank as possible. However, as a reader, I felt I was being cast into the role of Whitaker's therapist who was only being granted access to what Whitaker was ready to see and reveal about himself. Although this is not exactly a sanitized story, I couldn't help feeling that he was gingerly stepping through his story, picking episodes that weren't too grim (he wants our approval, not our pity) and speaking of his ex-profession in a way that is not judgmental (like a former alcoholic, he is &quot;recovering,&quot; not &quot;reformed&quot;). Written (&quot;collated&quot; may be the better word here, considering the number of verbatim diary entries he includes) after only one year away from Whitaker's last act of prostitution, the reader senses Whitaker's lingering vulnerability--the kind of tenderness one feels when poking a healing wound. There seems to be a plea for acceptance. I felt--again, like a therapist might--that I wa being asked to offer him my bottomless patience and unconditional good will. There is something a little sad about the way Whitaker peppers his story with quotes from the likes of Oscar Wilde and Andrew Marvell and with reminders of his love for classical music. It feels like an appeal for us to see him as a person who--though handsome and dionysiac--still has a mind, good taste, and resonant soul. And in the end, it may be these touches that make his story convincing and interesting.What you won't get from ASSUMING THE POSITION is a gleeful romp through the world of prostitution (read Hollander's THE HAPPY HOOKER for that), a gritty sense of time and place (turn to Rechy's CITY OF NIGHT), an insightful analysis of our society's ambivalent attitudes toward sex and the varieties of sexuality (if this has been written, I'd like to know about it), or a literary masterpiece (try Crane's MAGGIE: A GIRL OF THE STREETS). What you will get is a touching portrait of a life in transition. That we, as readers, have no clear picture of where this life will ultimately wind up may be somewhat disconcerting. That it reminds us that the same thing is true of our own lives, is equally disturbing. But then, isn't having one's conventional understanding of the world disturbed one of the reasons we read books in the first place?

I strongly disagree with another Amazon reviewer who said the quality of the art reproductions in Landau's biography varied. As someone who has bought a lot of art books, I thought the color plates exceptionally vivid and a more than adequate basis for studying Pollock's work in light of Ellen Landau's insightful commentary. Every major work is presented as a full-page (or double page) image. They are simply labeled by the painting's title (and an alternate if a painting acquired one in the art world other than the one Pollock gave it himself) and the date; the usual caption clutter (medium, size, present owner) are provided in an appendix.The narrative, divided into twelve chapters, is basically chronological. (Chapters are compact and can be read thoughtfully and leisurely in an hour or two.) Landau includes sufficient biographical information to help the reader appreciate the paintings. She doesn't ignore or minimize Pollock's alcoholism and character defects, neither does she dwell on them. The "evidence" and details concerning these matters are mostly confined to her extensive endnotes, along with expanded versions of key critics' comments on Pollock's work. Landau is cognizant of the influence of Thomas Hart Benton and gives it due attention(Readers who want to know more about the psychodynamics of the relationship between these two iconic American artists will want to read Henry Adams'sTom and Jack: The Intertwined Lives of Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock; see my Amazon review of that title). Readers with a lot of time on their hands who want a "womb to tomb" (to quote a favorite Pollock catch phrase) account of the artist's life are directed toJackson Pollock: An American Saga.Whatever biography you choose to read, you'll want Landau's book near at hand for the beautiful, detailed reproductions of Pollock's best-known paintings. The book's Selected Bibliography, unfortunately, includes only the works Landau consulted but did not cite in her notes. In other words, the reader will have to scour the notes to find other key works. (The bibliography in Adams's book is more recent, comprehensive, and reader-friendly).

The essays in this volume cover the first five years of the six-year run of the HBO original series Sex and the City. The first four sections of the book are comprised of scholarly articles on the subjects of (1) Sex, Sexuality, and Relationships, (2) Socio-Sexual Identities, (3) Fashion and Cultural Identities, and (4) Narrative, Genre, and Intertextuality. The fifth section contains mostly brief personal essays about the authors' appreciation of the show, and as such is the weakest in the book. I especially enjoyed Susan Zieger's essay, "Sex and the Citizen in Sex and the City's New York" in which she discusses one of the dilemma's facing third wave feminists, the conflict between identity politics and "do it yourself" citizenship. In it she observes "DIY citizenship is a consumer fantasy which always encounters the reality principle of identity politics." Mandy Merck's "Sexuality in the City" was also noteworthy. She engagingly addresses the often-discussed issue of whether Sex and the City is the product (and projection) of gay men's imagination (i.e., the producers) or an authentic depiction of contemporary women (noting that most of the episodes were penned by women).There's a lot of good stuff in these essays. While readers need to be fairly familiar with the series, its characters, and plotlines to get the most out of this collection, anyone with an interest in media or culture studies will be able to appreciate what the authors have to say. The book is indexed and has an excellent bibliography. Another fine volume in the Reading Contemporary Television series.

Pelikan is a truly amazing and articulate thinker. He seems to intuitively know what is important--whether providing a theological overview of Chrisitan history or, as here, focusing in on a single subject. What I found especially refreshing in BACH AMONG THE THEOLOGIANS is Pelikan's appreciation of Bach as a highly creative man who was truly a man of his own time. He puts to rest (for me anyway) the somewhat artificial argument about the sacred and secular strains in Bach's work. This &quot;tension&quot; ultimately does not seem to have been as big a deal for Bach as it has become for modern historians, musicians, theologians, etc. Perhaps, because Bach's sense of the sacred was much more encompassing than we highly compartmentalized moderns ever allow it to be. In any case, the fact that so many highly divergent groups want to claim Bach as their own is probably sufficient proof of Bach's transcendant greatness.This is a highly readable--though thoughtful and concentrated--book that deserves to be more broadly available. Perhaps some publisher will see fit to reissue it in paperback. I'd preorder a copy today if that was the case.

Nowhere on the cover or copyright page of this book does the publisher classify it as a novel...or as a work of philosophy, for that matter. I can't help thinking that this playful insouciance was probably at the insistance of the author. Alain de Botton has twice previously used a loose novelistic form to help readers engage with centuries-old philosophical ideas and dilemmas. His first, ON LOVE (US title), was nicely conceived and tightly executed; the second, KISS & TELL, had a darker, smarmier aspect since it included photographs of its young female subject and I couldn't shake the sense that I was peeking into someone dirty clothes basket without her consent.THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT is the most loosely assembled of the three novels (if, in fact, it is a novel). It follows a young woman's unexpected and unplanned journey into a romantic relationship (not her first) with a banker a few years her senior. Her name is Alice and the author clearly intends the reader to make connections to Lewis Carroll's young "adventurer." Secondary characters are added and dropped as needed and the novel, were it not so unique and fun, might be deemed a failure if judged by conventional standards.The arc of the story follows the predictable flow of the young couple's relationship--courtship, sexual consumation, mutual testing, failed communications, unexpressed expectations, outside flirtations, and eventual devolution. Nothing unusual or dramatic here. What is riveting is the way Botton is able to use philosophy to examine these very ordinary experiences. I think readers will have no trouble identifying with most of the thought processes recounted here and attributed to one of the two main characters. The novel (again, if it is a novel) is loaded with "Ah-ha" moments.A rundown of some of the chapter titles will give you a sense of the range of issues Botton tackles: "Reality," "Art and Life," "Story Envy," "In Love with Love," "Sex, Shopping, and the Novel," "Predictability," "Power and 007," "Religious Relationships," "Diving, Rousseau and Thinking Too Much," "Provincialism," "Passing the Guilt," and "Who Makes the Effort?" My favorite of his observations is from the chapter "Jollyism": "Gossip is an exercise in trust: a person feels free to gossip when they feel they have someone to understand their objections. It is a colluding activity; two people leave the main group and open their parcel of gossip material" (p. 205). Botton is happy to be our gossip partner and has many such parcels to open with us. If you haven't colluded with Botton already, THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT is a good place to start.

Though I'm only giving it two stars, this is not as bad a film as you'd think. And considering the price, I really shouldn't be complaining at all. After shining in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer," Elizabeth Taylor should be justified in claiming the crown as the quintessential Tennessee Williams actress. In one sense, she was a perfect choice to play the aging actress hiding behind the identity of the "Princess Kosmonopolis" in SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH. But Taylor is an actor who needs strong direction (think of what she an Mike Nichols accomplished in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF). What could have been every bit as good as the performance Geraldine Page turned in for Richard Brooks in the 1962 film is, in fact, something of a campfest--more of an Elizabeth Taylor impersonation than a true dramatic performance. (But then, is there a non-campy way to deliver the line, "Stupid, beautiful young man, that's my hash"?) As best as I could tell, this made-for-tv version of the play is closer to what Williams wrote than Brooks' theatrical release. (Back then, theater took more risks than movies ever did.) Although the Taylor movie is set in the 1950s the same as the play, it doesn't capture the mood of that period very well. In fact, when the Princess's traveling companion Chance Wayne (played by Mark Harmon) tries to blackmail her into giving him a movie contract (by tape recording her confessions about her drug use), the act seems downright implausible. When Paul Newman did the same in Brooks's film, it struck me more as a pathetic and ineffectual act, one that revealed Chance's boyish naivite and charm. In general, the remake is a conglomeration of unexplored nuances andd missed opportunities. Much of the film is shot in close-up and softened amber tones, giving it the feel of a daytime drama. (Tennessee Williams's plays are already dangerously close to being soap operas; they don't need an extra push.)As for the play itself, I consider it to be the best of the second-tier Williams plays (the first tier consisting of THE GLASS MENAGERIE, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER, and THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA). Many of the great Williams themes are here: abuse of power, the predatory nature of sexuality, the human fascination with youth and beauty, and the delicate nature of society's outcasts. What I find interesting about this play is how when the play opens we are exposed to the Princess's obsessive concern about growing old and losing her physical attractiveness, but by the end of the play this obsession has been transferred to the male lead, to Chance. The Princess is the steely survivor, Chance is the one who suffers and is destroyed (like Blanche DuBois before him) by his inability to adapt and move on. This play is definitely worth seeing. My hope is that Richard Brooks' superior (but not perfect) film will be made available on DVD (with extras!).

This book is a treasure for any Cadmus fan. While Lincoln Kirstein's 1992 monograph includes reproductions of all of Cadmus's major paintings, it only has a dozen or so of his figurative drawings. Justin Spring's book more than makes up for this lack (it has 67 color plates). The fact that he does so by taking on the seemingly narrow focus of male nudes is truly appropriate. While the paintings are often highly active, heavily detailed social satires with not-so-subtle homoerotic elements, the drawings are calmer, context-free, more admiring meditations on the male form. They are clearly the work of an attentive observer and a disciplined draughtsman. When the art world was going ga-ga over abstract expressionism and slap-dash gestural drawing, Cadmus was painstakingly working in virtual isolation. And though a number of sketches are included in this volume, it is the finished drawing that most interested Cadmus. Reginald Marsh, Jared French, Pierro dela Francesca, Michaelangelo, Signorelli, and Ingres were his dominent influences. Along with ballet photographer George Platt Lynes. And from writer E.M. Forster he acquired a philosophic outlook that would guide him both as an artist and as a man: "tolerance, good temper and sympathy--they are what matter...if the human race is not to collapse."Spring's five essays (Introduction, Beginnings, Development, Maturity, Conclusion) provide everything you need to know to fully appreciate the plates. He addresses Cadmus's homosexuality directly and without sensation and discusses Cadmus's well-reasoned reluctance to be associated with more blatantly sexual gay art (including his refusal to have one of his works reproduced in a biography of Tom of Finland, an admirer of Cadmus). Spring also identifies the models for many of the drawings; this is significant because Cadmus considered his drawings to be a collaboration between himself and his models. Cadmus's life partner Jon Anderson was his frequent subject from the late 60s until the artist's death, and it is fascinating to see how Anderson's body changed over time; the model clearly never lost his sense of comfort and ease modeling nude.Not revisionist history, just a long overdue update on a neglected but significant American artist of the 20th century. Universe Publishing (a division of Rizzoli International Publications) is to be commended on the design and quality of this book.

I bought this DVD without realizing that it wasn't Balanchine's two-act "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (for that you need to purchase the DVD of the Pacific Northwest Ballet's wonderful performance). The confusion is logical, though. Both Ashton's "The Dream" and Balanchine's masterpiece were written in the early 60's (Ashton's in 1964, two years after the first performance of Balanchine's work) and both utilize a variety of instrumental and choral music composed by Mendelssohn. It would be hard to believe that Ashton never saw Balanchine's ballet (if he didn't, he certainly listened carefully to the reports of his ballet-world spies).Both ballets are witty and respectful of their Shakespearian source. And both compress their storytelling to a single act (Balanchine tells the story in Act I and dedicates Act II to divertissements.) The confusion and rivalry of the two pairs of lovers (Helena and Demetrius; Hermia and Lysander) is amusingly extenuated in Balanchine's ballet; as is the story of Bottom's overnight conversion into an ass. But the pyrotechnics of the male leads (Oberon and Puck) takes center stage in Ashton's work. Steifel and Cornejo dance these parts brilliantly. And Titania (danced by Alessandra Ferri) is regal without being cold or spiteful (not quite the proto-feminist of Balanchine's ballet). Ashton's ballet has a sustained element of delight and never needs to resort to the tricks employed by Balanchine to dazzle the younger people in his audience (fog machines, cute ballet school students playing butterflies and fairies, and a cable to lift Puck skyward at the end of the ballet). Dance is king in "The Dream." Both ballets are great, and for me, Ashton's "The Dream" was a great discovery!Sadly, there are no extras on this DVD.

American Ballet Theatre director Kenneth McKenzie (a former dancer himself) knows how to find, encourage, and showcase great male dancers. The four featured here are a diverse group from the current crop of principals. McKenzie seems to look to Spain and Latin America for a certain kind of fiery performer (Angel Corella from Spain and Jose Manuel Carreno from Cuba represent this group here). Russians, who once dominated the ballet stage, are represented here by Vladimir Malakhov (from the Ukraine). Ethan Stiefel (the heart-breaker star of ballet-pic &quot;Center Stage&quot;) is the sole American.This film is a documentary with a short dance performance appendix. Each dancer is filmed on his home turf and speaks about the importance of his family and country of origin. Nothing too revealing here. Short clips from auditions and key roles do give the viewer a sense of the unique performance styles of each of these dancers. The dance &quot;appendix&quot; is a short work choreographed by Mark Morris to a Schumann piano quintet (mercifully, not to the rock standard &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;).The only annoying thing about this short film is that it seems to feel the need to defend the masculinity of male dancers. Didn't Edward Villella address that issue once and for all in &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;? My advice is to ignore the rhetoric and just enjoy the great dancing!

I can't overpraise this study Bible. Like its key rivals in the academic market, The Harper Collins Study Bible (HCSB) and The New Oxford Annotated Bible (NOAB), it uses the New Revised Standard Version as its text base (a good, responsible, and fairly literal translation of the full biblical canon--the 66 Old and New Testament books all Christian traditions use, plus 16 deuterocanonical/apocryphal books used in the Roman Catholic and/or Eastern Orthodox traditions). Also like its competitors, it has excellent scholarly introductions to each book, extensive explanatory notes, background articles, and maps.So why, if you already own a good NRSV reference Bible, do you also need to get this one? Because the book introductions are incredibly fresh and up-to-date. Because the study notes are insightful and well-phrased. And because, unlike the HCSB and the NOAB, the New Interpreters' Study Bible has two additional kinds of notes. From time to time, the NISB inserts a &quot;Special Note&quot; among the footnotes that makes an interesting observation on the text to help the reader appreciate the larger issues at play within the Bible as a whole. For instance, at 1 Samuel 2.9 there is a special note that calls attention to two distinct points of view in the Bible about justice/theodicy. These special notes are more information than the reader needs to understand the particular passage at hand (and as such can be easily skipped over because they are slightly indented and set off from the surrounding, more text-specific notes), but they are like little windows opening onto a much wider world...and should not be overlooked. In addition, there are almost 100 brief Excurses on thought-provoking topics like &quot;Sibling Rivalry in Genesis,&quot; &quot;Interpretations of Rahab,&quot; &quot;Suicide,&quot; &quot;Anti-Semitic Interpretations of Isaiah,&quot; &quot;The Influence of the Maccabean Martyrs,&quot; and &quot;Responsibility for the Death of Jesus.&quot; And the editors had the foresight to provide an alphabetical listing of these excurses, knowing that readers were going to want to come back to them from time to time.The essays included in the NISB mostly focus, as one would expect, on interpretive matters: &quot;The Reliability of Scripture,&quot; &quot;The Authority of the Bible,&quot; &quot;The Inspiration of Scripture,&quot; &quot;Guidelines for Reading and Interpretation,&quot; &quot;Varieties of Readings and Interpretations of the Biblical Text,&quot; and &quot;Culture and Religion Among the Ancient Israelities.&quot; The glossary is mostly a list of literary and theological terms (anthropomorphism, chiasm, theophany), but does include a few typical &quot;Bible terms&quot; that the reader may not find satisfying definitions for in a standard collegiate dictionary(such as, sackcloth, Gentile, Sheol).If you're a reference book addict like me, the NISB promises countless hours of pleasurable reading and exploring.

If readers don't want to think about love (or wince from personal recognition), they have no one to blame but themselves. De Botton's title serves as sufficient warning as to what this book is about. Young or old, straight or gay, anyone who has ever submitted to the experience of falling in love is bound to identify with either the narrator (who sounds remarkably like the de Botton of HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE) or his beloved, Chloe.As I read this book--which includes chapters entitled &quot;The Subtext of Seduction,&quot; &quot;Marxism,&quot; &quot;The Fear of Happiness,&quot; &quot;Romantic Terrorism,&quot; and &quot;The Jesus Complex&quot;--I kept puzzling over de Botton's subtitle, &quot;a novel.&quot; Was this tack something he chose as a way of preventing friends and family from offering advice and consolation (which are usually self-serving and misplaced), or as a way of preventing ex-girlfriends from seeing themselves in the relatively pleasing portrait he paints of Chloe? Whatever his intention, he has stetched the definition of the novel in an interesting way. The basic love story between the narrator and Chloe travels its predictable path in an uneventful, but quirky, way. Neither comes off as a villain or victim, though both can be quite nauseatingly cute or petty at times. Through it all they remain convincingly human and we are drawn into their foibles, insecurities, squabbles, and desires. In short, they &quot;live&quot; as fictional characters. Even the narrator's hyper-reflective attitude is not bothersome. These analytical reflections read like diary entries; but the reader has evidence that the narrator has the good sense not to let Chloe know how much time he spends THINKING about his feelings for her. And it is these reflections, after all, that make the novel such a fun and thought-provoking experience for the reader.

Roger Shattuck has provided a book that truly lives up to its subtitle: A Field Guide to In Search of Lost Time. The highly credentialed and astutely discerning author gives both the first-time reader of Proust and the Proustian scholar useful information that will help them read, enjoy, and plumb the depths of Proust's massive oeuvre. I count myself among the former group, having made a number of attempts at reading In Search of Lost Time, but always managing to stall out somewhere in the middle of Swann's Way and then jumping around the other volumes looking for amusing sections.Although certain chapters have been previously published, Shattuck has taken care to fully integrate them into this Field Guide, and readers will probably be best served by reading the book from cover to cover. Some chapters, I suspect, will be more meaningful to me after I've read more of the novel, but the ones I found most useful as a novice Proustian were &quot;Proust's Complaint&quot; (the &quot;clouding of the mind at the moment of achieving what it most desires&quot;) and &quot;How to Read a Roman-Fleuve&quot; (Check out the footnote on p. 25: it gives an abbreviated reading plan for those who aren't ready to read the entire 3,000 page novel from beginning to end). I also found the discussions about the English translations in the chapter on &quot;Continuing Disputes&quot; especially fascinating.Owners of the Random House/Vintage 3-volume Rembrance of Things Past should be warned that all citations are keyed to the 6-volume Modern Library edition of In Search of Lost Time. This is frustrating if you want to read a passage in context, but, on the whole, is not especially problematic since Shattuck quotes the passages that are most germane to his arguments. The Selected Bibliography is extremely short, but I suspect every work that made it to the list has earned Shattuck's high regard and is worth looking into.Proust's Way is a thoughtful work that any serious reader of Proust will want to keep at his or her elbow when reading In Search of Lost Time.

Much of this book seems to be a set-up for the last chapter in which Lee predicts that the 1979 Book of Common Prayer will most likely be the LAST revision of this classic of the Anglican worship tradition. He assures us that the influence of the BCP will continue to mold that tradition, but that the tradition will continue to expand, embracing multicultural influences, new views on sexuality, and the evolving dominance of nonprint media. Lee refutes charges that Epicopalians' reliance on their Book limits their expression of faith and spends several chapters helpfully explicating its various liturgies. Along the way, he provides a brief (too brief, by my accounting) history of how the BCP/1979 came to be, including discussion of the influence of the Scottish prayer books of 1637 and 1764, early efforts to reintroduce ancient forms of worship based on scholarly research on the liturgy. In the end, Lee eloquently affirms, "We ask the liturgy to bear an enormous weight of meaning. Good ritual that is capable of bearing such weight depends on a certain familiarity so that the forms, actions, and texts can become vehicles for the meaning they embody. If members of the assembly have to wonder what is going to happen THIS Sunday morning, it can lessen their ability to worship. If they have to worry about getting the words right...they may be less free to encounter the Mystery of Christ in those words" (p. 164).This book is just one of thirteen titles in The New Church's Teaching Series, a series that sets out to explain key Episcopalian positions on the practices, beliefs, and role of the church. Intended primarily for Episcopalians, I think Lutherans and Catholics will relate to many of the opinions expressed in these books. I strongly recommend the ones on the Bible: Opening the Bible by Roger Ferlo and Engaging the Word by Michael Johnston.

How does one measure a musical composer's thoughts and attitudes? When a composer does not provide the words to his own music, what are we to judge him by? And when the words are drawn from a sacred text or determined by a liturgical context? With a composer like Wagner who vehemently embraced a nationalistic gestalt, it is easy to understand the accusations of anti-Semitism. With Bach, it is less so.Consequently the brevity of Michael Marissen's 36-page essay on the subject of anti-Judaism in Bach's St. John Passion. Marissen's methodology is to briefly examine the parts of John's Gospel that have caused scholars to deem it the most anti-Judaic of the four canonical Gospels, to review the choral responses to the biblical texts in light of Lutheran theology as it would have been understood a century after the Reformer's death (Bach owned many volumes of Luther's writings as well as the Calov and Olearius Bible Commentaries), and to compare what Bach actually did with what he could have done (as evidenced by what other musicians did and by the approaches taken in such popular culture forms as the passion plays). Only rarely does Marissen turn to an analysis of the music to make his points. He does this in his discussion of cadence in relation to Jesus' sense of his own identity (p. 12-14) and in his discussion as to whether Bach used fugue to express the obstinacy of Jesus' Jewish adversaries (p.30 ff). Musical discussion within the text is keyed to the recording of Sigiswald Kuijken (editio classica 77041-2-RG, BMG Music), though an Appendix of Musical Examples lists seven other recordings of the work as well.The central essay is well argued and easy to follow. The footnotes are extensive and helpful, as is the list of Works Cited. The Annotated Literal Translation of the Libretto, which makes up the second half of the book, uses different type treatments to help the reader distinguish between Gospel text, chorale responses to the biblical narrative, and aria/arioso responses. The book also includes a 5-page Appendix on Anti-Judaism and Bach's Other Works (namely, the Cantatas for the 10th Sunday after Trinity and the St. Matthew Passion).

My native skepticism makes me distrust about one third of what I read in this highly engaging page-turner. And I suspect a careful historian or a reader who cared enough to do a little investigative research could catch author Marc Eliot on a number of factual and interpretive errors. Even so, DOWN 42ND STREET was a fun read. One of Eliot's most delicious vices is his ability to draw (nearly libelous) caricatures of many of the key players in New York's history, most notably its mayors. (For instance, this about Ed Koch's repsonse to the porn, drug, and prostitution situation on 42nd Street: "No problem, Koch insisted. Just leave everything to him. From here on in, he told one and all, it was going to be nothing but smooth sailing. After which, the smiling, gesticulating mayor, the ever-loquacious captain of the good ship "New York," led himself and the city straight into the worst political storm of his career.") The overweening journalistic style exhibits itself in Eliot's tendency to frequently end chapters with semi-mysterious cliff-hangers designed to keep us reading. It works, but I read on with a much eroded sense of trust.If you're willing to look past all that, and if you appreciate seeing large complex chunks of history telescoped into compact coctail-party-sized anecdotes, you'll enjoy this brief history of a truly fascinating piece of New York real estate. And one thing Eliot makes clear is that it IS all about real estate (i.e., money). Enormous and bizarre egos clash in scramble for profits. The history of 42nd Street is the history of corruption and neglect on the part of public officials; fear, fascination, and indifference on the part of citizens and tourists; and greed held in check by caution on the part of the private sector. In other words, there has been enough ambivalence about 42nd Street to keep Midtown in limbo (if not hell) for almost five decades. Eliot depicts this dilemma well. He also discusses what has been missing from most newspapers' accounts of the "resurrection" of 42nd Street: the fact that it was Organized Crime under the leadership of the Teflon Don, John Gotti, that almost single-handedly engineered the descent of one of the world's most amazing entertainment capitals into a truly dangerous place to be, day or night.Eliot's final assessment reflects many New Yorkers' cynicism about the Disney-ification of Times Square. With the influx of Mall-of-America type stores and a Toys-R-Us Ferris Wheel, can Ed Koch's pedestrian mall be far behind? Maybe so. But one thing is sure, 42nd Street is one street that never stands still.

Kew Gardens, a village in Queens about twelve miles from Manhattan, has been home to movie stars and Broadway performers (Charlie Chaplin, Miriam Hopkins, and Will Rogers), authors (Anais Nin and Dorothy Parker), and even Nobel Prize winners (Ralph Bunche). In many ways it has been a community ahead of its time.Author Barry Lewis is a New York native who has lived in Kew Gardens for thirty years. He teaches architecture and interior design in New York City and has contributed to a number of guide books. As a resident of the neighborhood, I was happy to come upon this nicely researched, amply illustrated, and intelligently written book on one of New York's more successful and resilient residential communities. Lewis does a good job of giving the history of the Kew Gardens and of explaining how it differed from other experiments to create residential garden communities within large cities in the early part of the twentieth century. He explains how the tone was set at the very beginning by the community's developers, Albon Man and his offspring. They sought to create a workable diversity within a harmonious whole: both commercial and residential, with both private homes and apartment buildings, and which allowed a number of architectural styles. The flavor of the community was also one of diversity (unlike its neighbor, Forest Hills, Jews and people in the performing arts were welcome from the beginning). Residents of the community will certainly enjoy reading this book. But so will students of urban planning and architecture.The book includes a bibliography consisting mostly of articles cited in the text; it would have been more helpful if it also listed a few more comprehensive works on urban development and architecture. The book could also have benefited from a glossary of architectural terms, an index, and a walking tour that would take people past significant landmarks discussed in the text.

Arguably, the three great stories of the Bible are the stories of Moses, King David, and Jesus. While some of the stories in Genesis may be easier for the average person to recount (loosely) from memory, the story of King David gets more ink from the biblical authors. With the publication of KING DAVID: A BIOGRAPHY by Steven McKenzie and THE DAVID STORY by Robert Alter, it looks like Israel's great king might finally be getting his due recognition (vis-a-vis Moses and Jesus, anyway). &quot;Part of the appeal of the David story,&quot; says McKenzie, &quot;has been the earthiness of its plot. It reads like a modern soap opera with plenty of sex, violence, and struggles for power. The relationships are intricate.&quot; David's story (found primarily in 1 &amp; 2 Samuel) reads like a season of &quot;Dallas&quot; and has inspired modern classics by the likes of William Faulkner and Joseph Heller. Anyone who works in an office, a government agency, or university is more likely to identify with David--or one of the secondary characters in his narrative--than they would with Jesus. David is as guileful as Jesus was guileless.In spite of his modest claim to be offering nothing new, McKenzie has accomplished an amazing feat. He has organized, presented, evaluated, and summarized recent biblical scholarship on the David story. He also discusses the scant, but intriguing, archaeological evidence of David's reign. He is not dismissive of the biblical record, but he deftly helps the average reader to understand the kind of reasonable skepticism that scholars have had to adopt in order to extract a plausible portrait of David from all the spin-doctoring the biblical authors and editors have put on the events they describe. The economy and clarity of McKenzie's prose and the relentless rationality of his argumentation is gripping and persuasive. He explains why scholars find certain texts &quot;apologetic&quot; and others more likely to reflect events as they might actually have occurred. McKenzie takes each major phase of David's career and methodically creates a portrait of the man. Each chapter ends with a short summary, so the reader has a second chance to decide for him or herself if the emerging portrait is credible. I found McKenzie's discussion of David's confrontation with Goliath and his brief, revisionist portrait of Bathsheba especially fascinating. The extensive bibliography directs the ambitious reader to works of primary scholarship (mostly in English) and to other literary treatments of the David story. To get the most out of this book, take McKenzie's suggestion and read or re-read the biblical texts first.

The movie BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has not come my town, but I've certainly cued into all the media buzz. So when I saw the little 55-page movie tie-in paperback with Ledger and Gyllenhaal on the cover I made an impulse purchase. In fact, I also bought Campbell Scott's audio CD recording of the story. Whether you experience this story through reading or by listening to Scott's thoughtful, nuanced performance, this is a powerful, poignant, and understated story.This story about two ranch hands who find love, passion, and companionship while herding sheep one summer, begins in 1963 and continues intermittently for many years, following a predictable trajectory. But its predictability is not the result of inept writing on Proulx's part, but on the tragic nature of two men trapped in a specific time and place. Proulx describes their situation with compassion and is careful to show her readers that these reticient cowboys are not clueless oafs, unreflective and inurred to their situation. The poignancy is heightened when we as readers reflect on how little seems to have changed since the time of the story--not the threat of violence, not the public unwillingness to allow two men to live together as intimate life partners. Proulx speaks with expansive tenderness. This story seems to be her answer to the Laramie Project. "We're not all like that," she seems to be saying. She's an amazing story-telling with an astounding gift for poetry and for capturing the way people really speak.Whether you read the story for yourself or experience Scott's recording, treat yourself to BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.

This &quot;very short&quot; (142 pages if you don't count the bibliography and indices) has turned me on to the entire Oxford University Press series of &quot;Very Short Introductions.&quot; This still-expanding series covers a vast array of religious, historical, philosophical, scientific subjects (think of all the electives you never had time for in college). I've always been turned off by the flippancy of certain popular paperbacks that purport to explain the basics of a variety of topics. By padding their discussions with low-brow humor and patronizing detail, they end up being two or three times longer than they need to be. The Oxford VSI books, however, take both the reader's interest and time constraints seriously.This VSI on the Bible, for instance, approaches its subject from a variety of angles (not just how the Bible came about over thousands of years, but how it has been interpreted by both people of faith and by Western culture at large). And the brevity of the text does not prevent the author from presenting some amazing ironies--like how the same book that has been used to oppress others (as Europe colonized and missionized the world) has served to give voice to those seeking to extricate themselves from the effects of colonialization. Two of the earlier chapters, &quot;How the Bible Was Written&quot; and &quot;The Making of the Bible,&quot; do an amazing job of explaining the basics about how the Bible came about, what exactly is &quot;the canon,&quot; and how and why one biblical voice differs from others (sometimes even within the same book of the Bible). The discussion is sane, balanced, and scholarly. Even people who have no interest in reading the Bible as a document of faith will have trouble disputing any of Riches's observations about this classic of Western literature. Well done, OUP!

I really appreciated this (very) short introduction to the Koran. As a Christian who is fairly familiar with my own tradition's sacred book, the Bible, I found it helpful in explaining how the Koran and Bible are different. The books that make up the Bible were written over many centuries, the Koran was written and compiled in less than a century (and five centuries after the latest book in the New Testament). Most Jews and Christians read their Bibles in a translation (leaving it to their biblical scholars to learn the original languages); the Koran is read and recited exclusively in its original Arabic, even in countries where Arabic is not a native language (Iran, Malaysia). The Bible contains many types of literature--poetry, wisdom sayings, compelling narratives, prophetic utterances; the Koran refers to events and stories (including some, like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures) but has no narratives of its own (not even the story of its primary prophet, Muhammad) and consists only of prophetic utterances. The Bible is quite long; the Koran is relatively short and some Muslims have memorized it in its entirety. The Bible plays a significant role in the liturgy of Jews and Christians; public reading of the Koran is not part of Islamic public worship.However, like the Hebrew Bible with its Midrashim and Talmud, and New Testament with the writings of the church fathers, the Koran has gathered around itself a enormous body of commentaries to help explain its difficult and contradicory texts. Many Islamic beliefs that are attributed to the Koran are actually based on the commentaries of its interpreters.I liked this book because it focused solely on the Koran itself. Most books I've picked up on Islam don't give this much attention to the Koran, or only refer to it intermittently. For a &quot;very short introduction&quot; there's a lot here to digest.The photos and illustrations are interesting and instructive. The book also includes a short chapter on reading Arabic transliteration, an annotated bibliography, and an index.

I have been unable to take these CDs out of my automobile's CD changer since I bought this set. It has really rekindled my interest in Faulkner. I never cease to be awestruck by this great American writer's ability to capture the distinct voices of people of all classes, races, ages and of both genders. And the three able actors who read these stories--Debra Winger ("A Rose for Emily" and "Barn Burning"), Keith Carradine ("Spotted Horses"), and Arliss Howard ("That Evening Sun" and "Wash") all do an excellent job of rendering these voices with great authenticity and compassion. Besides being examples of Faulkner's best short stories, the stories provide an excllent introduction to several families that are central to his most powerful and memorable novels ("That Evening Sun" introduces us to the Compson children who are the subject and narrators of THE SOUND AND THE FURY; "Barn Burning" and "Spotted Horses" introduces us to the "tribe" of Snopeses who are the focus of Faulkners great trilogy, THE HAMLET, THE TOWN, and THE MANSION; and "Wash" gives us insight into Colonel Sutpen, whose full story is told in ABSALOM, ABSALOM!" The selection of stories also does a good job of representing the range of Faulkner's talent and vision--the folksy humor of country people, the tragic character of the oppressed and marginalized, and the frustration people experience when their traditional values fail to equip them for the intrusion of modernity. It's all here.The CD set is augmented by several readings by Faulkner himself. (These are old recordings that were originally issued on vinyl and reissued on audiocassette, but it's great to have them on CD at long last.) Faulkner's reading from AS I LAY DYING is fast and breathless and is especially poignant in the Vardaman sections where he endows the youngest Bundren with a seer-like wisdom and nerve-rattling existentialism. The excerpt from perhaps his most difficult novel, A FABLE, and his brilliant Nobel Prize acceptance speech are stunning indictments an man's propensity to wage war coupled with a celebration of the human race's capactiy to endure and prevail in spite of depth of its folly.My only regret is that I paid full price for these CDs at a bricks and mortar store (who shall remain nameless). Get it from Amazon.com! It's the best price I've seen. And with the money you save, treat yourself to Hans H. Skei's book, READING FAULKNER'S BEST SHORT STORIES, which discusses all of the stories on this CD.

I learned a lot from this little book. For one thing, I learned that although the idea of the lectionary (select readings for different Sundays in the church year) has ancient roots, the current 3-year cycle as expressed in the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL) and used by liturgical Protestant churches is a relatively recent invention. It is a Protestant response to changes that began with Vatican II in the mid-1960s. Ramshaw does a lot to explain the philosophy behind the selection of Old Testament lessons (which can complement the Gospel text or stand in stark contrast to it), the role of readings from the Epistles, why we stand to hear the Gospel text read, and why the Gospel of John doesn't get its own year the way the Synoptic Gospels do.Ramshaw has reflected deeply and written extensively on the lectionary and other matters germane to worship. She is a very well-informed and articulate layperson. This little book should be required reading for all people who assist at worship or who serve on the church's worship committee. It should be given to recently baptized adults and new members of any congregation that employs the RCL. It answers questions clearly and concisely that would otherwise take the person in the pews years to puzzle through on their own. Each chapter ends with a set of though-provoking questions, making this a wonderful tool for small group discussions. I highly recommend it.

I chose this Italian-English/English-Italian dictionary over the others I was able to examine in a bricks-and-mortar store because (1) the print was crisp, clear, and larger than that of the mass-market size paperback dictionaries, (2) the paper is a higher-quality free sheet that won't yellow with age (dictionaries are the kinds of books you tend to hold on to for many years), (3) at 5 1/4 x 8 1/4 inches it is portable and fits nicely in my backpack, (4) the book lies open nicely and is not pinched in the gutter, (5) it covers a very generous 100K+ words and phrases, and (6) it was the only dictionary in its price category that had an easy-to-decipher pronunciation guide for the Italian terms. As someone who is trying to teach himself Italian, the latter point is very important to me. Io molto contento!

WHY WORSHIP MATTERS by Bishop Rimbo is a key volume in the new series "Worship Matters" put out by Lutheran (ELCA) publisher Augsburg Fortress. This is a series of short (under 100 pages each) but insightful examinations of important aspects of worship and liturgy (music, baptism, Holy Communion, the Lectionary, etc.). Rimbo's volume is a good starting point, because, after all, if one doesn't reflect on WHY one worships, the hows and wherefors don't matter much.This series is written primarily for Lutherans, but certain titles are likely to appeal to Episcopalians, and even to Evangelicals who are finding their tradition unsatisfying and unidimensional. WHY WORSHIP MATTERS is likely to have broad appeal because it forces readers to examine what they think is going on when they "go to church." Rimbo quotes Diana Butler Bass's description of the four kinds of congregations that experience growth: (1) those that "embrace evangelicalism," (2) those committed to becoming "user friendly" on the Willow Creek Community Church model, (3) those that adopt a psychotherapy or 12-Step style, and (4) those that are intentional about their mission. The fourth group does not represent one denominiation or theology, is neither liberal nor conservative, but is comprised of churches that are inventive in the way they blend local vision (confessional integrity) with Christian practice (liturgy, striving for justice, etc.). And it is this "fourth style" of being a church that Rimbo is clearly advocating for Lutherans.What I found especially appealing about Rimbo's take on church life, is his ability to uphold high standards (for music, the liturgy, the way we pass the peace, etc.), while also being generous and accepting of the way all Christians will inevitably fall short of these standards. "Things are never the way they _should_ be. But if we keep waiting for what _should_ be we'll miss what is real!" (p. 63). Another thing I appreciated is Rimbo's constant emphasis on the importance of community (both the church as a community of people who gather together to serve God and as a group of people who are not divorced from the larger communities they find themselves among.) "The kind of community to which the church is committed is not determined by territory, ideology, or fantasy. It is a place where each individual stands before God's judgment and mercy and where the well-being of the least dare not be ignored" (p. 51).Each section of the book concludes with a section of 1 to 5 questions "For reflection and discussion." These are genuinely challenging questions and worth reflecting on. There are 25 such sections of questions. I could see an individual taking a month to reflect on these as part of his or her daily devotions; or a congregation working through them in small discussion groups over the course of 4 or 5 weeks. Rimbo certainly gives us a lot to chew on. All for less than a cost of a movie in Manhattan!

It is never entirely clear whether author Susanna Kaysen was properly diagnosed. She went to the doctor to have a pimple examined and was persuaded to immediately check herself into one of New England's pretigious mental health hospitals...her doctor helpfully calling her a taxi. Her parents, shadowy figures throughout the book, seem to have offered no protest, and even happily paid the hospital bills. There's a lot to question here. Much later, she learns that her official diagnosis is borderline personality disorder...and treats us to the DSM-III definition of this disorder.What fascinated me about Kaynen's story is that it is very much the story of middle-class America at mid-century. The postwar mass compulsion to mime (or invent) normalcy was beginning to ring false. The forced buoyancy of the early 1960s was moving manically toward the disorder, madness, and assasinations that would make the year 1968 a turning point in American history (and therefore the history of the world). The culture at large was going through an identity crisis, experiencing its own large-scale borderline personality disorder: instability of self-image, uncertainty about life issues (sexual orientation, long-term goals, values), affective instability, impulsiveness, and even suicidal tendencies. Kaysen seems to be little more than an articulate symptom-bearer for this highly dysfunctional nation.These simple memoirs make for insightful supplementary reading for anyone who enjoys the great fiction chroniclers of American mid-century madness: Bellow, Mailer, Plath, Cheever, and Updike.The title of the book is borrowed from a Vermeer painting at New York's Frick Museum--Girl Interrupted at Her Music. Kaysen's is a thoughtful memoir and we can be happy that her music was only interrupted, never silenced.

Published at least a year later than originally announced, this volume completes the 12-volume New Interpreter's Bible Commentary (Volume 1, Genesis-Leviticus, having been published in 1994). I've really come to enjoy and rely on the broad and balanced scholarship represented in this series (although I have to admit I haven't read any of the volumes from cover to cover). Volume X has the text and commentary for The Acts of the Apostles, Romans, and 1 Corinthians, plus an excellent &quot;Introduction to Epistolary Literature&quot; by Robert W. Wall.Although the volumes are large and you'll need to dedicate 28 inches of shelf space if you intend to acquire the entire series (and you should), you'll appreciate the large, easy-to-read typeface and the inclusion of two English translations of every passage of the Bible (NRSV and NIV for the 66 books used by both Protestants and Roman Catholics; NRSV and NAB for the Deuterocanonical Books read primarily by Catholics). Besides verse-by-verse commentary, each book has a general introduction, &quot;Overviews&quot; to large sections within the books, and periodic &quot;Reflections&quot; (intended, I presume, to help kick-start many a pastor's sermon preparation). In addition, there are occasional Excursuses on a variety of fascinating topics (although there are none in Volume X, there are 4 in Volume VIII on the Gospel of Matthew). On the off chance that these commentaries won't answer every question you may have, the detailed footnotes and thorough bibliographies will direct you to all the right sources.My only gripe is that the series does not cover ALL the books of the Apocrypha as represented in the NRSV translation. There is nothing, for instance, on 1 and 2 Esdras or 3 and 4 Maccabees. My copy of Volume X came with an announcement that in Spring 2003, Abingdon Press would be coming out with the New Interpreter's Study Bible. I plan to pre-order it as soon as I can. My only hope is that this Bible will include the Apocryphal books they neglected in the Commentary. The announcment also stated that an index volume would be issued in Fall 2003. Can a CD-ROM be far behind?

I have always admired the clear, precise, detail-observant way in which Joan Didion has crafted her essays. She has a way of writing that suggests a trauma victim's detatched self hovering above her own body, carefully noting her own sense of bewilderment (or amusement) over what has befallen her. This is true whether she is writing about broad social phenomena as in SLOUCHING TOWARD JERUSALEM or THE WHITE ALBUM, or about more deeply personal events as her husband's death (and her daughter's near death) which she addresses in THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING. This last effort just earned her the National Book Award for non-fiction, a well-deserved honor. It is perhaps this clinical detatchment that prompted the hospital social worker to assure the emergency room doctor that Didion would not break down and require sedation when given the news of her husband's death. "It's okay," he says. "She's a pretty cool customer." What follows for the next two hundred pages is both an affirmation and denial of that assessment.Didion and husband John Gregory Dunne were married for almost forty years when Dunne died of a heart attack at home. In many ways their marriage was unique. Both were successful writers. And since they both wrote mostly from their home, they were together almost twenty-four hours a day, every day. They not only finished one another's sentences, they edited them as well. But it is Didion's ability to observe herself--her thoughts, her memories, her odd changes in behavior--that make her account of the year following Dunne's death so universal. And her honest and humble way of dissecting her feelings are what makes MAGICAL THINKING such a helpful book for anyone who has experienced the loss of someone dear to them. More so, I suspect, than any self-help book on grieving is likely to do. MAGICAL THINKING is likely to be a classic of the "loss memoir" genre on the level of C.S. Lewis's A GRIEF OBSERVED. I know I'll be recommending it to friends for years to come.

This is a fun musical! Why it was pulled from the theaters so soon after its original release and why Disney back-burnered this visually exciting live-action film is a mystery to me. But they've made their amends. This DVD has TWO featurettes about the making of Newsies and ANOTHER about the real turn-of-the-century newsboy's strike that the movie is based on. Also, it has director's commentary and sing-along lyrics. Some of the plot turns are predictable and Robert Duval's performance as publisher Joseph Pulitzer is a tad embarrassing. Ann-Margaret's as the dancehall performer, Medda, &quot;the Swedish meadowlark&quot; is not (though she inexplicably evaporates from the movie half way through). But the young cast is diverse and energetic. Dance sequences are tightly edited, but not in the annoying and disorienting way MTV videos are. You can appreciate the flow of the movements...and the dances and music in general support the story line and help define the different characters. If for no other reason, Newsies is worth the purchase price just for the opportunity to see Welsh actor Christian Bale (An American Psycho) sing, dance, and speak in a Bowery boy accent.

These memoirs by a talented screenwriter sometimes read like an implausible and unsellable film script. Nyswaner is so honest about his personal tragedies, disappointments, and shortcomings, it is hard to believe this self-awareness was so hard-won. He has the humble wisdom of someone who has managed to find grace in some of life's most graceless circumstances. His success as a film writer is back-story. How he as a small-town boy from a working class western Pennsylvania family achieved this success is not really explained. This is really the story of his descent into a personal hell of alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, self-loathing, and suicidal despair...and of his eventual recovery. If his recovery is not exactly phoenix-like, it will strike readers who have been through similar experiences as authentic. Nyswaner is, after all, an accomplished writer. He is no sloganeer or New Age spiritual salesman. His story ends not with blissful optimism, but on a note of cautious but grounded hope.At the heart of his life's story is his journey toward love. And key to what he learns about this powerful human experience is his relationship with a prostitute he knew as Johann. BLUE DAYS, BLACK NIGHTS begins with Nyswaner's account of Johann's funeral, so it is not "spoiling the plot" to say Johann dies tragically and prematurely and that his death is a pivotal moment in Nyswaner's journey. Nyswaner does not glamorize or vilify Johann's life as a prostitute, nor does he describe it in patronizing terms. It may be hard for some readers to believe that what Nyswaner felt for Johann could accurately be described as love. And it's clear that Nyswaner himself shares in such incredulousness. The biggest question Nyswaner seems to ask (and I believe successfully answers) is, Can love exist in relationships that are not completely honest? Nyswaner seems to be saying that imperfect love perfectly accessed opens a person's heart to deeper and more authentic levels of love. It is through facing the death and loss of Johann that Nyswaner is able to find the love he needs to care for his aging and dying parents and rebuild his damaged life.All this is to say, BLUE DAYS, BLACK NIGHTS has much to teach not just people who've been damaged by drugs and sex addiction, but also anyone who has ever failed to be completely honest with himself. It's a profoundly moving story, one I'm sure I'll read again and continue to learn from.

Someone at Penguin (James Atlas?) had a stroke of genius. The Penguin Lives series seems to takes its inspiration from seventeenth century writers like Izaak Walton and John Aubrey who churned out brief, engaging prose portraits of their contemporaries and other worthies. Readers know from the moment they pick up one of the Penguin Lives that they are not going to get a thorough-going, heavily annotated exploration of the person under scrutiny. They also know, when they check the page count, that they will not stall out midway and that they can easily finish it on a long weekend at the beach. The choice of &quot;celebrity authors&quot; to do the story-telling is also intriguing. Edmund White, for instance, may not have the final say on all things Proustian, but as a gay novelist and biographer of Jean Genet, we can be pretty confident that he will be forthright and honest when discussing Proust's sexuality and careful, appreciative, and insightful when discussing In Search of Lost Time. In fact, the balance White strikes in his discussion of the man and the novel is quite impressive. In contrast to many modern biographies that wallow in unflattering detail and leave the reader wondering how the subject ever managed to become a person worthy of being written about, White gives us a sense of what Proust was up against (personally and emotionally) without diminishing what he achieved. One piece of advice, if you do decide to buy this great little volume: Don't skip the bibliography. It's only nine pages long and White's descriptions of the books listed will point you toward some good reading (and away from some duds).

No small feat. The scenery consists of a chromium bar stool and 60-foot brick wall.Theater-buffs recognize Stritch as the legend she is. And most of us are rather pleased that her work in film has always been secondary (her best work in that medium was in Woody Allen's SEPTEMBER)...and that her heart will ALWAYS be in the THEATAH. Although this one-woman-show has plenty of musical numbers, it is mostly an autobiographical tirade, designed to woo our sympathies. As a stage performance it was incredible; as a filmed performance with many close-ups it's a bit disconcerting, like sitting on the corner stool in a prize fight. This is not to diminish the writing, pacing, humor, or the brilliance of Stritch's performance. It's just a little overpowering. At the center of her angst is her Catholic upbringing, lack of luck in love, and her struggle with alcoholism. In fact, she is so tough on herself that you almost fail to notice how tough she is on others. Just short of libelous, we get some very interesting glimpses of her fellow performers: Gig Young, Ethel Merman, Judy Garland, Marlon Brando, Gloria Swanson, and Rock Hudson, to name a few.So move your barcalounger back twelve feet, get out your handkerchief, and hang on to your hat (does anyone still wear a hat?) And enjoy a legend!.

Hornby has a great knack for creating interesting characters who are a bit flawed and amazingly ill-equipped to face the challenges life throws their way. In A LONG WAY DOWN he gathers four such flawed people at the top of an office tower on New Year's Eve, each one having come there for different reasons but all with the same purpose--to commit suicide. Martin is a vacuous and dishonored TV personality (he just finished a short prison term for having sexual relations with a minor); Maureen, the mother of a severely disabled son; Jess, a spoiled and foul-mouthed daughter of the minister of education, whose sister went missing years ago; and JJ, an unsuccessful American rock musician whose band recently split up and whose girlfriend consequently left him.On the surface, Hornby seems to given himself a writer's workshop challenge: take four people who have absolutely nothing in common and intertwine their destinies. What he has created, though, seems very honest-a study of arbitrariness itself. That the reader ends up liking this collection of sad-sacks, whiners, blamers, and Teflon-coated losers is a miracle (though probably not a surprise to readers of ABOUT A BOY and HOW TO BE GOOD). And along the way, these oddball characters charm us with their wit (or bowl us over with their appalling lack of it). For instance, Jess observes of men like Martin, "They think women are like laptops...My old one is knackered and anyway, you can get ones that are slimmer and do more stuff now." As a character-driven piece of fiction, this is a great read--fast-paced, and lots of fun.But I enjoyed it on another level as well. While I always avoid novels about writing novels, this one succeeds because none of the characters are writers, or even want to be writers. In fact, the characters are so wrapped up in their own narcissistic mishegoss that it's amazing that they ever have time to observe one another, let alone reflect on what is going on around them. And by making them non-writers, Hornby seems to be making a comparison between living and writing (not a new comparison, but cleverly drawn nonetheless). Naturally worked into the conversations, his characters reflect on the nature and power of storytelling, as well as on writerly subjects like point of view, similes and metaphors, causality, credibility, pretense, the plausibility and predictability of endings, the role of coincidence, metacommunication, tabloid prose, and reading as anti-social behavior. When Jess bluntly observes that "Everyone knows how to talk, and no one knows what to say," she certainly seems to be speaking directly for Horby himself. But in the end, it is perhaps Maureen, the most desperate of the quartet who speaks for Hornby most when she reflects on the reality of her mentally disabled son, Matty, "I only know one person in the world who doesn't need stories to keep himself going, and that person is Matty." For her, and for each of the characters in the story (and by extension, for all of us), having a story and risking sharing it is the same as having a life and living it...even though no one can never know for sure how theirs will come out in the end.

Alain de Botton may have a broad understanding of Western philosphy, culture, and literature, but STATUS ANXIETY is best appreciated when not read as an introduction to civilization's "great ideas." This book is less an introduction to philosphy than a channel surfer's peek at some interesting notions that have reared their pretty and ugly heads over the past couple of millennia. It is philosophy for the rest of us. While introducing arguments from the likes of Jesus Christ, Rousseau, David Hume, Adam Smith, Ruskin, and Thoreau, he persuades with examples from art (novelists Austen and Flaubert; painters Thomas Jones, Christen Kobke, Hubert Robert...and the painters of "vanitas" images) and from pop culture (Punch and New Yorker cartoons and advertising images). If there is any consolation in the philosphy he presents, it is that status anxiety is universal (even ascetics and anti-materialist bohemians suffer from it) and seems to be hardwired into the human psyche. What he eventually affirms is that the spheres of philosophy, art, politics, religion, and bohemia have all provided (to varying degrees) moderately successful strategies for coping with the anxiety that comes with not feeling good enough in the eyes of our neighbors, colleagues, friends, and peers, and that each of these spheres has a way of recasting the definition of success so that those who might otherwise feel excluded or judged can affirm their self-worth and assert their own definitions of "success in life."I especially appreciated his discussion of meritocracy (page 45-71). When, as a society, we accept without question the notion that all people have equal opportunities, it is easy to be smug when we succeed (acquire wealth and fame) and to become indifferent to the struggles of those who do not acquire these societal rewards. In a meritocracy it becomes almost essential to hold such "under-achievers" in contempt (as weak, stupid, dishonest, foolish, or lazy). In short, to label them as "losers." Once labeled, it is easy to dismiss them altogether. This sense that our own merits are responsible for our success (and that luck and social location do not factor in) is the fuel for the status anxiety that seems to be rampant in Western culture today. I think I appreciated the chapter on meritocracy so much because American culture seems to take the existence of merit-based systems as evidence that democracy works. De Botton is the first author I have read who has identified this shadow side of American democracy and optimism. Although he doesn't lay out an exit strategy, de Botton at least exposes the problem.My favorite anecdote in STATUS ANXIETY comes from the chapter on philosophy (p. 111): "As Alexander the Great was passing through Corinth, he sought out Diogenes and finally found him sitting under a tree, dressed in rags, with not a drachma to his name. When the most powerful man in the world asked the philosopher if he could do anything to help him, Diogenes replied, "Yes, if you could step out of the way. You are blocking the sun." The people hoarding all the status will forever be the targets of philosophers, artists, the authentically pious, radical politicians, cartoonists, and people from the bohemian counter-culture.My modest, three-star rating is due to the fact that status anxiety seems to be such a universal human experience, yet de Botton sadly excludes any arguments from non-Western traditions. (Oddly, there is not even a mention of Zen Buddhism in the chapter on religion.)

This film is a visualized version of the diary Nijinsky wrote while living in a sanitarium in Switzerland. Derek Jacobi reads from an English translation of the diary. The film, like the diary, assumes you know who Nijinsky was, the roles he created and performed for the Ballets Russes, and about his complex relationships with his mentor Serge Diaghilev and his wife Romola. Taken as a whole, this film could be seen as a contemplation on the fine line between creativity and madness. The filmmakers have done a good job of selecting which passages to use. They neither avoided nor gravitated toward the most shocking ones (the sexual nature of the dancer's relationship with Diaghliev is clear, as are his tendency toward "self abuse" and the frequenting of prostitutes). Also apparent are his grandiosity (he virtually claims equality with God) and his pathetic need to be loved by an audience. The film is populated by dancers portraying the characters that were created on Nijinsky--such as, the spirit of the Rose, Petrouchka, the blue god, and the Faun. In the context of the readings from the diary, these characters seem more than ever to be fractured parts of the great dancer's inner essence. As arty and "high concept" as this sounds, this really is a beautiful and interesting film. Don't, however, expect it to answer any questions you have about the life of Nijinsky. It is, after all, Nijinsky's version of Nijinsky. One moment he seems to be a seer in the tradition of the poets Baudelaire or Rimbaud, the next, a self-deluded fool. Either way, he was clearly a creative genius whose flame burned brightly but all too briefly (his peak years as a dancer and choreographer were from 1906 to 1913; he died in a sanitarium in 1950). If you can enjoy films that don't fill in all the blanks, there's much in Paul Cox's NIJINSKY to appreciate.

I am starting to lose patience with history writing that interprets historical events through the lens of the personal character of the key players involved. (Such history writing usually leaves me wondering how accurate the author's take on his/her subject's psyche is, or, whether things would have been different if the subject had had a good hair day or started off their day with a solid breakfast.) Hogeland's account of the Whiskey Rebellion seems to have struck a good balance between narratology (understanding characters' motives) and analysis of objective, provable facts (in this case economics and politics).Hogeland is a gifted writer. His description of whiskey making (pp. 64-66) is beautiful, almost poetic; his depictions of the frontier practice of tarring and feathering one's perceived enemies (pp. 20-23; 143-44) is chilling. His discussion of the economics of the early years of US nationhood is precise and convinciing without overwhelming the reader with theoretical concepts. In the end, Hogeland leaves the reader with a number of questions that continue to be relevant today: What rights should government have in controlling mob violence? free speech? How do national economic policies get shaped and implemented? What assurance do the poor have that government officials won't enact policies that benefit only themselves and their cronies? What moral standards should the military be held to and what are the ramifications when they fail to do so? How can individual rights be protected in the shadow of popular movements? What constitutes fair taxation? Clearly many Bill-of-Rights sorts of issues were being tested in this early conflict between one group of US citizens and their government. Hogeland does a good job of presenting this often-overlooked event in American history in a way that is both engaging and though-provoking. (The endnotes are also worth reading; they do a good job of identifying sources and making the author's case for his particular interpretations. Excellent bibliography.)

If Oxford University Press had done nothing but reset the first edition (1970) in a more readable typeface, the second edition would have been well worth its purchase price. They did this, and more.The Reading Guide (RG) in the first edition was set with the text running the full width of the page, making it difficult to read; the RG in the second edition is set in double columns like the Biblical text itself and is a pleasure to read. The first edition numbers the RG, Old Testament, and New Testament separately, making it hard for the reader to use the supplementary aids. The pagination of the second edition only distinguishes between the RG and the Biblical text and always prefaces a page number with the abbreviation "RG" if the reader is being directed to the Reading Guide. The second edition, like the first, is really two books in one. The biblical text and extensive footnotes are those of the standard New American Bible (NAB; OT 1970; revised NT 1986; revised Psalms 1991), so the translation and notes, with the exception of the Psalms, are identical to those in the first edition with the exception of the Psalms. The NAB is an erudite and largely literal translation of the biblical texts based on the best original language texts and was prepared by eminent biblical scholars (most of whom were Roman Catholic). The 525-page RG, which includes a number of well-researched and carefully presented background articles and thoughtful introductions and detailed overviews for each book of the Bible, were prepared by a different team of Catholic scholars. At times, the RG authors take issue with the translators of the NAB. These are not contentious contradictions, but refreshing alternate views on various biblical matters, and testimony to a "new openness" on the part of the Roman Catholic Church that began in 1943 with Pope Pius XII's encyclical "Divino Afflante Spiritu," and reaffirmed by Vatican II. To bridge the gap between these "two books," the editors have inserted easy-to-locate references to specific pages in the RG throughout the biblical text, another welcome innovation of the second edition. (It is perhaps worth noting here that Hoppe's introduction in the RG to the Deuteronomistic History, i.e., Joshua through 2 Kings, makes up for the lack of a comparable introduction in the NAB proper, which presents Joshua and Judges as though they are part of the Pentateuch rather than belonging among the historical books that follow them.)The publisher boasts on the back cover that "the study notes have been completely rewritten, and there are new and expanded essays and sidebars on special topics." Many of the book introductions/overviews remain quite close to those of the first edition. One wonders whether this is because they were so good to begin with they did not warrant revision or whether it is merely evidence of "editorial laziness." Is it possible that in 30 years, consensus scholarship has not evolved or that nothing new has been learned about each and every book of the Bible? (To be fair, Osiek's introduction to Philemon does reflect the ongoing discussions about how to interpret this short, but difficult letter of Paul.) The new essays are, "Biblical History and Archaeology" by R. A. Simkins, "Catholic Interpretation of the Bible" by K. Madigan, and "The Challenges of Biblical Translation" by R. D. Witherup. These are excellent and welcome additions. Simikins's and Madigan's contributions, however, lack short bibliographies which all of the other background essays have. This is a shame because their topics seem to call out for "further reading." While reading Madigan's article, in which he cites numerous early Christian and medieval landmark works, I found myself wondering if they were available in good, well-annotated modern English translations. (His essay, by the way, should be required reading for all Protestants seminary students.) As for "sidebars on special topics," there are only 18 of these, some of which are more charts than discussions of a topic. The one on the Shema, "Hear, O Israel" is disappointingly short (3 lines!); the one on "Hebrew Poetry," however, is better than most I've read on the same topic in other study Bibles. But surely, 18 such sidebars are too few. (The Contemporary English Version Learning Bible has over 100; The New Interpreter's Study Bible has 97 "excurses"; and the recently published New International Version Archaeological Study Bible has more than I can count.) The Glossary at the back of The Catholic Study Bible, while good, does not seem to have been updated in 30 years. (The definition of "fundamentalism" is pretty much confined to its American Protestant expression; surely this could have been expanded to reflect current world-wide religio-political phenomenon.)Other improvements in the second edition include a 25-page index to the Reading Guide, a 94-page concordance, and 52 text-specific maps. The latter are so well-conceived and thoughtfully executed that I doubt most readers will ever bother to refer to the 14 beautiful color maps at the back of the volume that Oxford owns and reproduces in all their Bibles.As with all editions of the NAB, I find two things extremely frustrating. First, the footnote cross-references are marked by superscript alphabetical letters. While it is easy when reading the text to find the appropriate cross-reference at the bottom of the page, it is nearly impossible to do the reverse operation because the footnote cross-reference is not preceded by the chapter and verse number of the verse being referred to. The other thing is that the NAB (presumably continuing a tradition begun with the Douay-Rheims Bible) uses a very idiosyncratic method for punctuating citations; where standard (Protestant-influenced?) bibliographic systems use colons or periods to separate chapter and verse, the NAB uses commas; periods are used to separate non-contiguous verses within the same chapter--thus "Gn 13, 2.5-8" means Genesis chapter 13, verse 2 and verses 5 through 8, or Gen 13:2,5-8, as the Society of Biblical Literature would have it.As Madigan rightly says in his essay on "Catholic Interpretation of the Bible," "since [Vatican II], Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Scriptures have been methodologically indistinguishable." This being so, Protestants should feel comfortable adding The Catholic Study Bible to their library and consulting it often.

This send-up of Hollywood makes Altman's Hollywood satire THE PLAYER look like it was shot under water by actors on valium. The pun-intendted title suits this series well. It is jammed with clever plot-twists and stellar talent (principals Jay Mohr as the Darwinian narcissist producer Peter Dragon; Ileana Doublas as the ultimate Hollywood insider, a professional sex worker whom Dragon makes his assistant producer because of her faultless nose for good--and bad--scripts; Jarrad Paul as the neurotic TV writer who hopes to make it in the big-budget action genre with his script for "Beverly Hills Gun Club"; Jack Plotnick as the ambitious but massochistic, dry-cleaning-fetching gay executive producer; and Buddy Hackett as Dragon's nap-susceptible body guard and chauffeur who just also happens to be his uncle). Add to this a number of cameos from the likes of Keanu Reeves, David Hasselhoff, Scott Wolf, Salma Hayeck, Sandra Bulluck, and "that Joe Isuzu guy" (David Leisure playing an out-of-work version of himself serving as security guard/gate-lifter at the studio lot).Originally produced for Fox TV, the series takes a jab at everyone remotely connected to "the business." As rude, politically indifferent, and self-serving as Peter Dragon is, you soon come "to feel his pain" when you see the number of spoiled brats, self-promoters, and losers he is asked to manage and/or navigate among in the course of any given day. (When he seeks spiritual counsel from a rabbi at a funeral, the rabbi is quick to offer him a script to read. "Streisand is very interested," the rabbi assures him. Dragon takes the script, asking, "Starring or direting?" When the rabbi answers "Directing," Dragon tosses the script in a nearby trashcan. Mohr's expression? Priceless!)The writing for the (unlucky?) 13 espisodes is consistently top-notch. The fun never lags. It is as if everyone involved knew Fox would not give them a second season and they had to pack everything into the first. (Everything beyond episode 6 was new to me, so I suspect Fox never even broadcast everything they had.) Although we don't ever get to see the premier of "Beverly Hills Gun Club," or the predictable Oscar snub, the story arc is satisfyingly complete at the end of episode 13 when the legal rights to the threatened script are secured and Douglas's character returns to her more honorable previous profession.I'm so glad the makers of this show believed in it enough to put it out on DVD--and with a "making of" featurette and filmmaker commentaries for several episodes. This is satire at its most outrageous--directed at such a worthy target.

This is a beautifully produced little volume of Eakins's photographs and paintings of nude males (the phrase "absolute male" is a journalistic euphemism for male art class models stripped of their posing straps). The text is thin and doesn't really say anthing new. The paintings are also likely to be familiar to anyone who has studied Eakins and have been frequently reproduced in more comprehensive catalogs. Even the photographs, called "Naked Series" because they show a single nude model from multiple angles, have been reproduced previously. Dating from the 1880s these may interest the student of early photography. While author John Esten seems to consider these to be works of art in their own right, they clearly served primarily as reference material for Eakins. This is most obvious in the swimming pictures and in one painting called "The Wrestlers" which--muscle for muscle, sinew for sinew--is based on a photograph he took of fellow art students in Paris in 1899 (pages 68 and 69).The book includes a 2-page chronology of Eakins's life and a bibliography. The latter is a very short list; it only cites 19 works, two of which are books of poetry (Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" makes sense, but I fail to see the relevance of "The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake".) Very relevant but not cited is Helen Cooper's excellent 1996 book "Thomas Eakins: The Rowing Pictures" (ISBN 0-300-06939-1). If your primary interest is a book of beautifully reproduced images, these shortcomings will not bother you.

This is a fascinating combination of documentary and taped rehearsal session. Throughout the film, conductor John Eliot Gardiner has opportunities to make astounding and thought-provoking pronouncements about Bach and his music. "The big paradox," he says, "is that Bach's music, for all its provincial origins, has more universal appeal than--arguably--that of any other composer, including the great names like Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. He combines the physical/earthy with the metaphysical/spiritual. The intellectual foundation of his art is as strong as the sensual/euphoric side of his musical output." Maestro Gardiner's enthusiasm is apparent in the way he works with his soloists and instrumentalists as they work together to craft what must have been a brilliant performance of Cantata No. 63, "Christians, Remember This Day." While this taping is pretty much a love-fest all around, there are hints in statements made by the musicians who have worked with Gardiner over the years that the Maestro was not always such a benign shaper of the collective process (one male singer compares Gardiner to a rather critical and demanding girlfriend...a rather telling analogy, I thought). As a non-musician, I was fascinated by the variety of ways Gardiner was able to articulate the subtle qualities he was looking for from his musicians' performances. The discussion of the proper way to pronounce the German word for "torment" was especially fun to witness.Another telling quote from the Maestro: "I count myself very fortunate to have grown up in a family of musicians who weren't professional musicians, but for whom singing was very much part of the way of life. My parents had a particular love of German music....I feel that having had that privilege of learning Bach's music early on, never in a church context, but always in a secular context, that it's made me have a deep affection for this music of Bach. And also, it's makes me feel his music is still to a large extent misrepresented and misinterpreted because, when done in a strict German context, often the joy of the music goes out the window and becomes serious [evangelical Protestant] music and it lacks [joy]." With this in mind, it's no wonder that the rehearsal of Cantata No. 63 was chosen for this documentary. It's one that Gardiner finds exceptional among Bach's output because it is not based on a Gospel or Scripture text, does not preach or sermonize, and is completely given over to a festive and "dance-like" spirit.In case you're wondering, this documentary presents large chunks of music and it is possible to enjoy the film as a performance piece. But DON'T fast-forward past the "talking head" sequences. The exchange of ideas between highly gifted creative artists is an exciting thing to behold.

I bought this DVD because it included a dance piece (&quot;Image&quot;) by Ben Stevensen, the choreographer who created my favorite version of &quot;Cinderella.&quot; &quot;Image,&quot; a longish solo piece danced by Janie Parker, is based on the tragic life of Marilyn Monroe. Like most ballets created for a single performer, it suffers from the lack of other dancers to play off of. The focus necessarily stays on Ms Parker, and her writhing and angst truly become too much. If a ballet can be preachy, this one feels like a marathon sermon by Jonathan Edwards.But I found the two pieces by a choreographer I was previously unaware of, Christopher Bruce, to be very interesting. Though very different from one another, &quot;Journey&quot; and &quot;Ghost Dances&quot; share an eligiac quality. Neither work is entirely plotless, but both are more about the relationships being presented than they are about the unfurling of a complete and coherent storyline. Bruce seems to have been influenced by Martha Graham, Jerome Robbins, and Paul Taylor, and shares with those three masters--when the dance gods are working in their favor, anyway--the ability to be theatrical without over-manipulating the audience. Like them he knows how to make full and meaningful use of the stage and demonstrates a love and respect for the human form. The dancers seem to hover between a secure groundedness and flight. There is room for elements of play even when the larger theme is mortality. &quot;Journey&quot; is set within a ballet class and seems to reference Robbins's &quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot; among other works. &quot;Ghost Dances,&quot; as Bruce reveals in his introduction, is about people who disappeared under authoritarian regimes and is danced to haunting South American folk music performed by Inti-Illimani. It is the concluding dance on this DVD and by far the strongest and most accessible.All the dancers are gifted and a joy to watch. They do an excellent job of combining classical ballet with modern dance--a trend most of the smaller ballet companies seem to be following.Each of the ballets is introduced by it's choreographer.

Nick Flynn has been dealt a cruel hand. This memoir tells of the author's troubled relationship with his alcoholic father, his mother's suicide, and the tendency of all the family members to get caught up in criminal activities and drug addiction...and to live marginal, unsettled lives. Flynn's father spends many of his adult years living on the streets of Boston. Father and son reconnect because the son works in a homeless shelter. The father claims to be a poet and to have written a ground-breaking novel that Little Brown is prepared to offer him $2 million to publish (or $4 million, depending on the time of day and the degree of his alcoholic grandiosity). The literary connection between father and son is something that seems to haunt and frighten the younger Flynn. In the end, he seems to recognize that he is somehow his father's scribe and that the memoir he is writing is the "story" his father never mananged to get down on paper. "That book somehow fell to me, the son, to write. My father's uncredited, noncompliant ghostwriter. Not enough to be stuck with his body, to be stuck with his name, but to become his secretary, his handmaid, caught up in folly, a doomed project, to write about a book that doesn't, that didn't ever, that may not even , exist" (p. 322).what is ironic, and somehow true-seeming, is that people who come from the most disengaged families turn out to be the ones who become the most enmeshed with their parents and who come most dangerously close to repeating their parents' mistakes. Flynn has insight to his family dynamics, but this doesn't seem to help him avoid the poinlessness of numbing himself out on drugs and alcohol or from forming anything but superficial, need-based relationships with women. He does seem to progress from open fear and hate of his father to an authentic, but realistic sense of compassion for the man who was never there for him.ANOTHER NIGHT is pretty much a chronological account of Flynn's experiences, but it is written in various styles. Some of these work nicely and bring a welcome change of pace and infusion of energy to what is otherwise a depressing storyline. In a chapter called "Same Again" he does riffs on the varioius cliches about drinking you are likely to hear in a bar on any given night. The change of genre he does in the chapter "Santa Lear" seemed less successful. Here, he depicts as drama the exchanges between a number of drunks doing seasonal work as Santa Clauses and their "daughters" (social workers?). But overall, Flynn is a keen observer with a writing style that is poetic without being florid or unnecessarily terse. I'm curious to see what he'll produce next.

This book from Frederick Ungar Publishing's Modern Literature Monographs series is clear, thoughtful, and engaging...from a decidedly European perspective. In fact, I suspect many American literary critics fail to place the necessary emphasis on European models (Strindberg, Ibsen, and Georg Kaiser). Horst Frenz helped me, for the first time, to appreciate O'Neill's love-hate relationship with the commercialism and mediocrity of American theater in the era immediately preceding the one he transformed. (Clearly his father's bitterness at being a successful actor who was unchallenged by the roles available to him created a profound wariness in his son.)Also to be appreciated is the way Horst keeps biographical details to a minimum (just enough to help the reader get a handle on the wide range plays O'Neill turned out). I felt I got the overview I desired from this brief introduction to the playwright. If I was left wanting more, it was more clarification on how O'Neill related to (and influenced) his contemporary playwrights, especially Tennessee Williams. But overall, the book's brevity is its clearest asset.

This book is Bart Ehrman's explanation to the non-technician of what he and his fellow biblical textual critics do for a living. As he says of Bible translators and Bible readers in general, "They know [what's in the New Testament] because scholars with unknown names, identities, backgrounds, qualifications, predilections, theologies, and personal opinions have TOLD them what is in the New Testament." Although the bulk of the book addresses the theory and practice of textual criticism these chapters are sandwiched between a very personal introduction and conclusion in which Ehrman describes his journey from an fundamentalist/inerrantist, to a scientific skeptic (my description, not his), to a compassionate realist who recognizes that all readers are like the scribes who intentionally or inadvertantly made changes to the texts of the New Testament over the years (to read is to interpret, filter, and process; to interpret is necessarily to change by expressing in new words). If you're not interested in Ehrman's personal journey, start at chapter 2 and read through chapter 7; you won't miss any vital arguments or illustrations.Ehrman gives an excellent historical overview of the field of textual criticism, names key persons who changed the way the biblical text would be approached forever, explains why some non-Greek texts are more valuable than Greek ones, explains the importance of the Church Fathers, differentiates between scribal changes that were intentional and those that were accidental, and explains how the nature of copying texts changed from the early days of Christianity when any half-way literate, willing person could be induced to copy manuscripts for the Christian community and the Middle Ages when a highly skilled class of professional scribes became the primary copiers of texts. Although much of this information was not new to me, this is the first time I have read such a well-argued, forthright, and complete account of the subject. Non-Christians who are baffled by Christians' infighting about the nature of the Bible will find Ehrman's account enlightening and logical. I found his examples of where biblical texts mostly likely were intentioinally changed to refute Gnostic, Jewish, or pagan objections (or to minimize the authoritiy of women) to be especially lucid and convincing. Overall, a very interesting book.

No super photography here. Minimal history. And future Oscar winner Halle Berry struggles to try to give the banal script some life. I thought watching this video would trigger fond memories of my visit to Paris and teach me a little something besides. No such luck. I hope the other videos in the "Great Streets" series are better this one. Rent, don't buy, this one.

I bought this book after watching the British television movie, "Queer as Folk," which is set in Manchester, England. The bars, restaurants, public relations offices, apartment buildings (old and new), provided an exciting backdrop to the club-hopping, trend-setting characters in that movie. The combination of modern architecture and the thoughtful repurposing of nineteenth century factories and warehouses struck me as exciting and playful.Although I have been unable to identify any of the buildings from the movie in David Hands and Sarah Parker's "little guide to [Manchester's] recent architecture," the book did confirm my sense that the people of Manchester have worked hard to be neither pure preservationists nor reckless redevelopers. Each of the 65 structures covered is represented by one or two photographs and receives, at the most, a page and a half of descriptive text. The photographs are beautiful black and white images, though sometimes it is difficult to tie the image (often a detail, such as an entryway) to any particular description within the text. The writing is delicious and beautiful in its own right, even when you're not quite sure what the authors are talking about. (For instance, this of Malmaison: "To avoid pastiche the new facade is grey-granite aggregate and concrete block. Designed to be behind the Hoyles building, sliding into a former lightwell in its V-shaped plan. This juxtaposition has informally bonded the two volumes, creating a large hard-landscaped piazza, clearly identifying the hotel's presence and purpose.") There's a lot in these descriptions to unpack, but I feel the authors have made astute observations and assessments (usually positive, though they are not afraid to deliver a well-earned jab here and there as well).As a guide, I felt it suffered from the lack of a good, comprehensive introduction (for instance, I would like to have learned more about Manchester's industrial past and to have gotten an analysis of how the city responded to the 1996 IRA bombing that was responsible for much of the city's recent rebuilding). I would also have liked to have had a map or two, suggested walking tours, and more context photos. But for it's price and size (a very compact 4 X 4 inches), I was quite satisfied with what I got.

This is not as specialized a reference work as you would suspect from the title. The six introductory articles are among the best I have read on the development of the canon, hermeneutics, and the status of biblical scholarship. These run a mere ten or sixteen columns each, yet feel comprehensive. They reveal the editors' infatutuation with statistical information (numbers of male named in the Bible vs. the number of females; the number of named women vs. the number of unnamed women; names that recur most frequently, etc.), and their interest in exploring what these statistics hint at. Clearly the editors and authors enjoyed creating this landmark publication. While the authors are not timid scholars, they seem to know when they have reached a dead end or hit an informational barrier. When the Bible is silent on an issue, they are comfortable acknowledging it.Also worth praising is the organization of the book. Part I consists of all the women named in the Bible (including the Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal books) in alphabetical order; Part II lists all the unnamed women (or groups of women, such as, &quot;Daughters of Lot&quot; and &quot;Women at Vashti's Banquet&quot;) in Bible book order (following the NRSV sequencing) by their earliest significant Scripture reference; Part III, perhaps the most fascinating section, is a compilation of female deities and personifications (such as, &quot;Asherah/Asherim,&quot; &quot;Female Images of God in the Hebrew Bible,&quot; &quot;Woman Wisdom,&quot; and &quot;No 'Male and Female' in Christ Jesus&quot;). While great care has been made in providing cross-referencing, there is no general index to the volume. Readers will need to be very intuitive (and perhaps keep a concordance handy) if they want to find entries in Part II (the largest section of the book) by any method other than Bible book order. The volume is completed by an annotated listing of &quot;Additional Ancient Sources,&quot; which directs the reader to some important texts that never made it successfully through the maze known as canonization, but which are sure to provide some interesting information on the status and role of women at different points in the ancient world.

My interest in Patricia Highsmith was sparked by the two movies based on her novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (the Matt Damon picture and "Purple Noon" in which Alain Delon plays Tom Ripley). I have read a couple of the other Ripley novels, but continue to prefer the first one over any of the sequels. In researching Highsmith on the Internet, I saw a collection of stories called "Little Tales of Misogyny" listed in her bibliography. Needless to say, the title intrigued me. Though many of the stories in "The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith" have been continuously in print, I have been unable to find a copy the Misogyny Tales.The Misogyny Tales take up about 60 pages of this 724-page collection, each tale being only 3 to 5 pages long. It's hard to know what to make of them. Each story features a female character who embodies a specific aspect of the feminine personality; Highsmith allows this quality to unravel to the fullest extent possible, always to the detriment of those who live with or near the protagonists. The titles of the indivdual stories will give you an idea of the range of topics covered: "The Invalid, or, the Bedridden," "The Middle-Class Housewife," "The Breeder," "The Perfect Little Lady," "The Prude," "The Victim," etc. As damning as these stories are of their protagonists, in most cases the reader is likely to be somewhat in awe of the misguided heroines (as we are of the amoral Tom Ripley). Highsmith draws these characters with quick bold strokes using indelible ink. The reader is not given time to warm up to any of the characters and in the end they function more as archetypes than as full-blown fictional characters. Does Highsmith have nothing but contempt for her own sex? Possibly (think of Marge Sherwood in "The Talented Mr. Ripley"). Does she resist feminist rhetoric and politcal correctness? Certainly (you need only read "The Victim" to be convinced of this). Can she write in an honest and thought-provoking way? Absolutely! In some ways her attacks on middle-class convention and mores remind me of the stories of H.H. Munro (Saki) and Shirley Jackson--ironic and hard-hitting at the same time. Even when being her most brutal, she leaves room for pathos.According to the dust jacket, Highsmith turned to writing short stories later in her life (beginning in the 70s). "Little Tales of Misogyny," interestingly, was first published in German (1975) before being published in English (1977). My only wish is that with a book of this nature (one spanning the author's entire career) that the date of authorship was given for each story. (It helps to know, for instance, that "Little Tales of Misogyny" was written during the height of the 70s feminist movement.)The book, by the way, is very handsomely typeset and bound, worthy of an author whose recognition and esteem seems to be growing since her death in 1995. Graham Greene's Preface is brief but insightful.

This documentary recounts the long, intimate relationship between author Christopher Isherwood (Berlin Stories ... which became I Am a Camera ... which became Cabaret) and the portrait artist Don Bachardy. Isherwood has been dead for over 20 years, so the documentary consists primarily of an extended one-sided interview with Bachardy (we hear his thoughts but not his interrogator's questions) as he knocks about an enviable Southern California beach house full of tasteful mementos of his life with Isherwood, reads Isherwood's diaries (voice-over provided by Michael York), and sketches a smattering of nude youths. Bachardy's speaking voice is strangely accented and somewhat affected, and is full of "ums" and "uhs." While Bachardy has charm and the details of his story are interesting, I found myself getting increasingly relieved whenever the film shifted to archival footage.While the film will possibly appeal to a broad-minded general audience, it will be of special interest, I think, to gay men (and possibly lesbian) viewers. For one thing, the film shows the way homosexuals in days past had to define their relationships for themselves. Before gay marriage (with its implied monogamy) became a cause celebre, men like Chris and Don needed to consciously craft their own understanding of what they expected of one another. Don speaks frankly about both being taken to Hollywood parties openly as Isherwood's partner/date (and enduring homophobic comments from Joseph Cotton) and about his interest in seeing men outside their relationship. Yet somehow their relationship with one another was primary and mutually fulfilling. It is also interesting from the perspective of the thirty year difference in their ages (Don was barely legal when they started their relationship). As in classical man/boy relationships, there was an element of mentor and protege. Isherwood wisely encouraged Don to pursue drawing and painting, rather than writing, and their relationship does not seem to have suffered from competitiveness. It was gratifying to see that Don had a sense of himself, one Isherwood encouraged, and that Don was no mere boy toy or trophy wife. Thirdly, this film is likely to interest gay men because of the sense it gives of how much has and hasn't changed for gays since the early 1950s.The filmmakers have done a good job of augmenting Don's story with archival footage and interview clips from people like Leslie Caron and James White. They also seemed to have a realistic sense of their subjects' standing on the world stage (they acknowledge that Isherwood was a good though not a major 20th century writer). During the course of this film we get to see a number of portraits Bachardy did of Isherwood, including some of the many he drew during Isherwood's final days. The filmmakers show but do not assess the quality of Don's work. The earlier portraits seem to have been mostly charcoal sketches or black and white watercolors (many of which were stunning); these were followed by minimalist, gestural drawings employing thick brush strokes (impactful when they hit the mark); and his current paintings are in the bright colors of the Fauves (which struck me as erratic and infantile). If he's an artist in decline, he doesn't seem to notice or mind. In the end, it is his life that's his greatest creation and it is an honor to hear him tell his story without complaint or apology.

A thoughtful, well-prepared documentary. The right balance of talking heads and archival performance footage. Directors Anne Belle and Deborah Dickson clearly took the time to understand their subject. And Suzanne Farrell's full cooperation with the process is the single most important thing that kept this fascinating film from being one more cliche-ridden, outsider's view of the demented, masochistic world of ballet. Jacques D'Amboise and Arthur Mitchell, as well as Ms Farrell herself, go a long way to disprove the theory that dancers are inarticulate when not moving through space. Their recollections and insights serve as a nice counterbalance to Farrell's emotionally-charged self-assessments. Although much of the film focuses on explicating Farrell's relationship with choreographer George Balanchine (the film's creepiest moment of pathos is when Farrell goes into her bureau drawer and takes out a billet -doux from her mentor and reads it for the camera), ultimately it is Farrell's strength of character and survival instinct that leaves the strongest impression. The final words of the film are hers: &quot;There have been no 'if onlys' for me.&quot;Although the DVD has no dynamite extras, it serves as the perfect format for this kind of film. After watching the film all the way through, you're going to want to go back and watch some of the dance sequences over and over.

It's hard to believe there was a time when the images in this book would have been considered pornographic. But if Singer's portrait of Madame Pierre Gautreau ("Madame X") was considered scandalous because he painted her with a dropped shoulder strap (later repainted in its proper position), then you can understand why these male nudes (mostly charcoal sketches and quick watercolors, but also some finished oil paintings) were kept unexhibited for so long. We have Sargent's sisters to thank that they were not destroyed outright, but carefully placed with museums for safekeeping.If text is the clothing of art books, then Donna Hassler has provided THE MALE NUDES with less than a loin cloth. But there's not much that needs to be said, anyway. The plates should be enjoyed in their own right. I especially enjoyed the charcoal drawings. They are contextless and their strong outlines give them extra punch and a sense of iconic completeness. Though well rounded and subtly shaded, they remind me somehow of Jean Cocteau's spirited line drawings. The watercolors reminded me of Winslow Homer's. All in all, a nice little book.

Like most of the study Bibles put out by Zondervan Bible Publishers, this one is targeted mainly to Evangelical Christians with a fairly literalist view of Scripture. The cautiousness of their approach to their subject is exemplified by their choosing to use the older New International Version Bible text (last updated in 1984) with its bias toward masculinist language rather than the Today's NIV (2005) which took some heavy criticism from high-visibility Evangelical preachers for its employment of inclusive language (even though the revision was quite restrained in this regard). The conservative Protestant stance of this Bible's editors is also evidenced by the fact that it excludes (and only makes passing reference to) the Old Testament Apocrypha books, including the fascinating 1 & 2 Maccabees, two primary texts known to provide some very key information on the "inter-Testamental" or "Second Temple" period (not to mention the biblical basis for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah). The exclusion of the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonicals would make this an unacceptable text for most Roman Catholics.That said, however, this Bible has a lot to recommend it. The short articles on archaelogoical aspects of the various biblical periods are well-researched, interesting, and to the point. They seem to reflect awareness of the best of secular archaeological research available without necessarily conceding to securlarist opinions. Much information is captured in easy-to-reference charts and timelines and the text is amply illustrated. The footnotes seem to be original to this study Bible and are not simply picked up from Zondervan's best-selling NIV Study Bible. The volume concludes with a helpful Glossary, Index to the articles, and Concordance--so the purchaser of this Bible will have no excuse for being confused or lost.For those who have trouble reading small print, be warned--this is a challenging typesetting. The Bible text runs the full width of the page with tightly spaced lines and the footnotes are extremely small. Also, all editions seem to have the words of Jesus in red, something I've always found pointless, hard to read, and annoying. (Aren't quotation marks and the words, "Jesus said" enough?) Although this is not likely to become my favorite "everyday" Bible, I'm sure I'll pull it off the shelf from time to time to read the insightful articles and look at the picutres.
