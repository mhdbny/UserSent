DEEP...MOODY...AND SPIRITUAL. WHEN THEY BURY ME, I WANT PSALM TO BE PLAYING AND IF THE GOOD LORD IS WILLING, I HOPE THERE IS AN ACCOMPANING THUNDERSTORM. AFTERWARDS, THEY CAN ALL GO THROW ONE BACK IN MY HONOR AND TELL LIES ABOUT ME. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC.

brilliantly romantic...ms. horn has such an elegant passion in her voice, you cant do anything but respect the power of it. she could be singing &quot;i'm a little teapot...&quot; and with her voice and the musical arrangements she could still invoke the powers of love. you will love this.

...i've been listening to jazz seriously for only about 15 years, but over that time i've explored about every type of jazz so far envisioned...from smooth to acid to contemporary to traditonal, etc.,.....traditional is by far my favorite of it all...and out of that, i think i prefer the tenor sax and the trumpet the best.ben webster is marvalous.clifford brown is a baaaad man.miles and trane of course.branford!pharoah sanders!maceo parker!lester young! okay, enough...yall get the idea......but this is my first hank mobley purchase and it's an excellent thing! it's got a little kick to it that i wasnt expecting, but i love it...from the ballads to the more uptempo swings. a friend said it reminds him of some ol' "mo betta blues"-type of sound...probably...i can see terence blanchard revising much of this material...but there's a lot more depth here and that's due to the all-stars that accompany hank on this!everyone should take some time out of their dayto listen to, relax to and enjoy the pleasures of the jazz sound!but if you only do it once a week, then this is a good one to listen to!

im a big believer in 'grown folks music'; caint a grown man get a 'soundtrack of his life' that doesnt revolve around hoochiemamas and men with way too much jewelry in they mouths???i mean, JUST ONCE!?!?on that side, sista hathaway comes thru...this is definitely nothing you'll find on the radio.but sista hathaway mighta came at us a lil TOO grown; this has little heat, no passion, not much insight...joe sample might be one of her influences, but she's too young to be considering him one of her 'contemporaries'.she doesnt hafta measure up to her daddy, but she definitely hasta show us signs of life and living.but i'ma ABSOLUTELY LOVE this album when i turn 60 tho...22 years before that happens... hopefully, young sista will find her inner voice to go along side her brilliant outer voice.

the framework for each current 'Kast album is set in place by the previous album...Stankonia wouldnt be the 100million-star album it is without these boys layin the groundwork with Aquemini. this was such an outstanding piece of work when it came out that it confused many folks who thought they knew what hip hop music was all about...'Kast put the heart and intelligence back into the music and many didnt even know it was missin until they heard this! for me, the title track is the best, &quot;aquemini&quot;: &quot;even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die, horoscopes often lie and sometimes 'y'...nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain, it's him and i, aquemini&quot;. &quot;liberation&quot; is another tight track with cee-lo from goodie mob, erykah bad-@ss-baby-mama-badu and big rube(who needs to quit playin around and put out his own spoken word joint - get it done, folk). only two albums have really captured my attention since this came out in 1998 - Stankonia in 2000 and jay-z's Blueprint this year. this is about as classic as an album can get.

You can lissen to this album anywhere...flossin in your ride...slumpin with someone you love over plums and candlelight...all by yourself as you unwind from that 9 to 5...or at your mama's house during Sunday's dinner! This album appeals to everyone, even my daddy likes this cd. E'rbody needs some Sade in their collection, ya'll can start with this one and work backwards to her earlier work. What logical explanation can you have for not having this in your rotation? You can play this between N'Dambi and Jazzyphatnastees. You won't regret it, trus'me. Peace, folk.

i always heard me some aretha playin on the radio somewhere in my mama's house when i was growin up but my first real recollection of seeing her was in the movie 'blues brothers' (a classic!)...but, alas, i came of age in the 80's, meaning i couldnt appreciate any of the true artists that gave meaning and definition to the words &quot;soul music&quot;... the 80's was the antithesis of soul - electronic, synthesized and cold.so to make a short story shorter, i started gettin my soul back in the late 1990's... and aretha has been leading the way for me ever since!aretha, gladys, isaac, al, teddy, marvin, ojays, isleys, patti, smokey, stevie... if you breathe, you should own at least ONE of each of these folks cd's... this is cornerstone music...start with this one...remove the annoying protective seal,open case,remove cd and watch the sun reflect gently from the surface,place cd into player,press play...and gitcho soul back!

SEVERAL, several weeks. now, &quot;!!!ROMANTIC!!!&quot;?...i love that song, the woman is just sultry! and the sound is that somethin' SLEAZY i can really sit back and vegetate into; buy it for that song and record it onto a mix-tape or cd with your other favorites...what i do is plug my playstation into my vcr and record six hours of my favorite songs onto a video tape...it's time consuming, but worth the effort!

kindred!this is a very very good cd... they are a neo-styled ashford and simpson! good musical concepts... good musicianship... i have never seen them in a live setting, but i bet that would be a TEN-STAR performance!!! however, i'm jus not pushed over with this studio-album overall... no fault of the wonderful artists displayed here... they do an excellent job, fareal yall... her vocals are jus a tad bit reminiscent of jill scott's (not a bad thang at all!) and his are a deep, forceful 'moan' that you dont hear coming from male artists anymore/he proly coulda been a member of the temptations back in the day (or even now! the temptations are still doin their thang!)... maybe this will grow on me over time, but for the grownfolks out there wanting somethin to bite into, this wouldnt be the FIRST cd i'd recommend them to get, but i wouldnt discourage them from getting it either... a very solid debut.

ah, i miss the jazzish, reggae-influence of her 'peace of mind' EP... that's a classic; dont think she'll ever top that for me. (still havent heard 'dexterity' yet... no local retailers have carried it and i've been too damnlazy to order it from my wish list)but this is pretty good... damngood, if you ask me.i really caint say that this is more in the vein of mainstream RnB... has more of a downtempo lounge feel to me, like, let's say you got to your favorite downtown hang out EARLY... before it got crowded and smokey and full of nearly-inebriated patrons... this might sound like her full-dressed rehearsal as lil sista prepared to storm the stage later in the night...but definitely, julie is the most consistant sounding soul sista (as far as these underground lounge divas go) than any of her contemporaries... if you liked her before, you still will.and if you havent heard of her yet, then go getchu some 'peace of mind' first and 12 months from now, when you get down playin it, go back out and get this thang herre.

ive been 'a writer' in the loosest form of the word for omose twenty years now and on occassion i'll pick up some other people's poetry and see what's what... i was standin in a bookstore flippin thru mr. young's 'jellyroll' and instantly loved it! - i didnt buy it tho - i'm cheap and i'm thrifty and 'to repel ghost' seemed to be the better buy for my money (there's like abillion poems in this thang!)...i started off pretty intrigued/fine and dandy...brotha young is hit and miss, but overall, he gives us a pretty good effort...(does his own personal background matter? i dont know... but it doesnt really make much difference to me. being raised 'well-off' doesnt prevent a person from experiencing hardship...)((umm, i get sidetracked pretty easily, so let me get back to my review/thank you!))my biggest gripe with this book is proly more a reflection of my own patience than of mr. young's writing skills...quite frankly, I GOT TIRED OF READIN ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER... i found myself moanin & lamentin as i turned each page, hopin to not see either 'basquait' or 'warhol' in print EVER AGAIN... but it never quite played out that way...i do think that brotha young tried a lil too hard to capture basquait's 'essence'... i think i'da rather seen him write about his own interpretations of the artwork, rather than try to tell the painter's life thru biographical poetry...this might have been a much better experience if it was only HALF its length... some of it reads well... other parts are more tedious... but im grown. i guess i coulda stopped whenever i wanted to... but like i said, i'm cheap and i didnt wanna feel wasteful...aint nothin worse than to trudge thru some poetry...(...tho, many people have said the same thing about my own 'writings' ...the @#%&!#&-ers!!!)...anyway...much of this is 3 to 5 star material. my overall rating of '2' is more my anti-basquait-angstisms coming into play.

...this album is the natural progression of what 70's SOUL MUSIC shoulda become...there is so much funk on this thang here that i jus might stop playin my zapp-II album altogether! (at least for a while anyway!)...man, i put an extra 30 miles on my car jus drivin around my subdivision because i kept waitin for a weak song to come on so i could go into the house - IT NEVER HAPPENED! brother cee shows his roots with this, some rock, some funk, hip-hop of course...THESE ARE THE MOST INTELLIGENT LYRICS I DONE HEARD IN A LONG, LONG TIME...this thang is somethin pure! if this dont go platinum then there aint no hope for us...for the best sense of what yall are gonna get with this, then imagine brother al green being the front man on your favorite p-funk album! that's how serious this is...enjoy it...

me and thievery corporation fell out MONTHS ago... but i gotta hand it to 'em (as well as everyone else on this project!), they all done did good! 'downtempo' was borderline lazy for me, but they done freshened it up some with this and caught my imagination again... maybe it aint all so bad afterall; looking forward to the individual releases of all the artists compiled here. get this yall and get swept up into it... i'm hard to please, and even i cant complain!

nothing over-extravagant, no million dollar special effects, no wire work...just a simple story of a modern day samurai.......set in the streets of new york......with not one asian character in the story...clint eastwood did the same thing back in the day, settin his samurai-stories within the framework of the old west...the only difference here is that 'ghostdog' retains some of the flavor that inspired it by showing and building upon it's asian influences...be warned tho: er'body aint gonna like this...it is a bit slow moving, and if you lack the appreciation of urban culture and eccentric story-tellin, then this proly aint for you...(if you're lookin for somethin just as original but more authentic then 'crouching tiger, hidden dragon' is an excellent movie...in fact, i'm watchin that right now for about the thousandth time on dvd!)the one thing i got from this movie more than anything else is how much we allow our own cultural background to cloud everyone else's...like the mafia-types in this movie sitting around perplexed as to why forrest's character calls himself 'ghostdog'...they equate it with the rappers and urban culture and then they make references to how native americans named themselves 'running bear', 'black elk' and such...and then they miss the complete irony because they have names like 'sammy the snake', 'joe rags' and 'big angie'......funny...anyway...i enjoy this...some of yall might too...later for yall...

coleman hawkins is quoted on this thang as sayin it took nearly 20 years for duke and him to get together/so this was an extremely anticipated event within the jazz-world-realms... (okay, enough insight, yall know i dont do that!) ...if you grew up lissenin to more jazz than you did r&amp;b or soul music or classical, then get this, you proly gonna dig it... if you are over 40 and you love traditional jazz, then get this...i love this disc, it is excellent american music/i jus dont make the time to lissen to this the way i would like to...i recommend this for the serious jazz heads only... start with duke's collabo with coltrane over this one/get that one first and if you really feel it, keep this one in mind for later....

...i've been lissening to jazz now for only about 14 years...i started out by buying what i thought was jazz, groups like najee, gerald albright, david sanborn, etc...; those guys are fine musicians in their own right...but, i've learned that there is a difference, somewhat, between &quot;jazzy instrumentation&quot; and &quot;jazz music&quot; if you are really just beginning to explore the core foundations of jazz and you like artists like miles, coltrane, duke ellington and such, then this cd is an excellent addition...the music here is not the straight ahead and take charge, hard edged jazz that many people find hard to get into, but it is laid-back, very enjoyable and still distinctive enough to please most traditional jazz enthusiasts.other artists worth exploring are sax player ben webster, trumpet player clifford brown and milt jackson on vibes....whether this is your first jazz cd or your one thousand and first, this is a great one to have in your collection.

...at first lissen, i thought a fight or somethin had broke out...(in my overactive imagination, i thought that maybe ella fitzgerald was bumrushin the stage in protest or somethin)...but all that happened was that ms. vaughan had knocked somethin over...(dag! that all!?!?!)...whatever mishaps or miscues occur over the course of this outting (and there are a few!) sista sarah holds it down!!she aint jus 'sassy' here, she's funny and sincere and completely professional...she's for real and honest and that is somethin that studio recorded albums sometimes miss out on...(maaan, thank god nobody with a camera or recorder was around when i was makin my mistakes!!! i couldnt be this graceful!!! it might've gotten ugly if it was me...somethin like "maaan, you betta gimme that tape!!")sometimes adversity breeds somethin beautiful...and while this is far from being sista sarah's technical best, it most definitely is one of her warmest recordings and i enjoy it more than her other so-called 'soulful' performances...yall cant go wrong with this one...

...back when i was coming up, groups like kraftwerk and art of noise were as much a part of the hip-hop community as afrika bambaata or mantronix...sadly, true hip-hop is no longer that diverse (take a moment to pour your favorite libation here)...anyway, this cd right here is pretty damn good especially honey, boss on the boat, ocean beat, the key and doris dub. this aint no where near hip-hop, there is no hard, edgy beats to be found here and it's not jazz, but some of the tracks had wes montgomery's &quot;angel&quot; feel to it....tosca keeps things interesting by introducing a variety of sounds and melodies every so often instead of locking onto any one particular beat and looping it for an entire song....if you're anything like me, and you're looking for something completely different outside of your usual listening standards, then this downtempo thing right here aint too bad a place to start.

...afrocentricism was a serious crusade for african americans in our attempt to balance the historical insight of this country to be more inclusive to all of the people it represents...a very lofty goal, but once it became an aspect of commercialism within music, it became less of a statement and more of a fad, sad, but true.but for many of us, what krs and others had to say was like life-music...it didnt just challenge white folks, it challenged the fear of white folks among many black folks and also some of our fears with each other...inclusion into the cultures of others shouldnt always equate to the dissolvement of other ones, room must be made for everyone. every american is important, as are their points of views, but it is ironic that many who cant get down with mr. kris parker have less of a problem with today's deconstructive and meaningless music than they have with his messages of outrage and upliftment......okay, where was i? oh, yeah...THIS ALBUM IS HOT! ONE OF HIP-HOP'S TOP 20 OF ALL TIME...SHOW SOME LOVE YALL....

...well, i believe all'a his cds are under appreciated, but thats jus me.i thought this was pure genius when it first dropped and time has done nothing to change that opinion.i found a crate of my ol' school cassette tapes yesterday and i been playin ER'THANG... all'a yo yo's tapes, salt n pepa's stuff... wc and the maad circle, audio two's first two tapes... schooly d, 3 times dope, del... ER'BODY! ...even isis (of xclan) and harmony (from the bdp camp)...ya know, most ol school hip hop is only good for reminiscing nowadays... the lyrics and production were good for the day, but dont always hold up under the 'modern standards'...but edutainment's different. this remains nearly as fresh today as it first did when i got it. might be brotha parkers 3rd or 4th best album of all'a em: criminal minded, ghetto music, edutainment, then live/hardcore/worldwide...i could put this on around family gatherings, just to educate the young'uns on what 'real' hip hop is about.im'a have this on cd before the weekend's out...

...this was the first mmw disc i purchased and really had a hard time enjoyin it. as far as their foray into traditional jazz, this was very average (outside of about two cuts). if i was gonna buy a standard jazz album, it would be somethin by duke ellington, horace silver, miles, etc.,.......they really came into their own, however, when they began to expand into the realm of jazz-fusion. if you are a jazz purist, then this is probably the only disc from them you would enjoy, but if your musical tastes are a bit more diverse i would suggest some of their other works.

...and that musbe me. actually brotha bradshaw's disc gets 3 anahalf stars, but i jus couldn muster the strength to round it up... why??? because SMOOVEJAZZMUSDIE!!!! (ima have that tatted on my fo'head before i meet my maker)not to mislead yall tho, cause mr. jeff does some fantastic thangs with this cd; his collabs with vocalists such as jill scott, my girl n'dambi, bilal and others, are amazing. he is definitely the future for (gawd, dont make me say it again please!) smooth jazz... hidden beach has a whole stable of jazz artists waiting to emerge and offer us they thang.i look forward to checkin to see if he has released anything else, because i will be buying it/belee me.but smooth jazz serves no purpose: caint dance to it, caint make love off'a it, caint stand to be enclosed with it when riding up and down the local elevators...(lookin back, maybe i shouldna lissent to so much bobby byrd prior to doin this review... my bad!)but this is a pretty good disc, specially the second half of it where it gets very pleasureable...it's jus, smoovejazzbedamnd aight?(when i get over that fear for all thangs smoove then ima be okay... i promise!)sm.jzz fans will be extremely pleased... those of us more 'stuffed' around the collars wont be lifted into euphoria, but neither will we be truly disappointed. jeff bradshaw has good thangs in his future and will be a very familiar name before its all said and done.

I like coltrane and i like some &quot;smooth&quot; jazz...this album for me is the perfect balance of both sounds. branford and nem bring an honest, hard-played effort to this recording...they did an outstanding job of creating some music that is fresh, invigorating and spirited but still remains withing the realms of what passes for Traditional. i cant compare this to coltrane and i wont compare this to boney james...but i think both of them would greatly appreciate much of this album. REQUIEM is an excellent cd...i enjoy it immensely. comparing this to his other recordings, this is the best one to my liking, so far.

stronger than your average 'smooth jazz' cd... has a bit more 'soul' to it; mr. marcus aint afraid of a well placed beat which is what helps keep your attention when listening to some mellow sounds... (unless you just WANT something that's gonna put you to sleep!) ...as far as smooth jazz goes, this is 5 star disc, but since i'm a very picky person and stubborn (my friends will attest!), i can only give this a 4 overall because the weight of this cd is carried mostly upon the shoulders of 3 or 4 tracks and not as evenly as i would like...i miss alyson williams and wish she would return with an album or two... she coo's oh so very lovely on the one track given to her... and marcus's version of 'til the cops come knockin' is somehots#it!to the less critical fan, this is a must have. i hope yall enjoy it.take it easy now,sum.

...i first bought this about 8 or 9 years ago, in fact it was like just the third cd i had purchased ever, tryin to transition over from cassette tapes. most of the jazz i had at the time was mostly funk or vocal related (ronny jordan, norman connors, shirley horn, etc.,...), but i was lookin to expand into the more &quot;serious&quot; stuff.alas, this proved to be too serious for me!all of that fuss over charles mingus? and this was it!?!the truth of the matter is that this was just the wrong mingus album to start my interest in.some of this is &quot;listenable&quot;, but i still cant say that i enjoy it. 'ah, um' is a far more acceptable album for us neophytes to begin with. take it slow gettin to know mingus, keep your ears and mind open and you'll find pleasure in most of the music he's made.

...i imagine God layin beneath a starless sky on a patch of dirt with a small puddle of water in the middle of it...He's bored and lookin for somethin to get into, layin on his back, one hand submerged into the pool...flippin water into the air from that hand inspires him to create the stars and then it all comes together: Genesis....this is the soundtrack to our beginnings....if coltrane's 'a love supreme' represents the spirit of man pleading to his creator, then this represents God contemplating only to Himself....very foreboding, extremely dark...i love it, but i can hardly recommend this for others to listen to. i bought this about six or seven years ago and probably havent played it more than six or seven times. it's good if you have a multi-disc player, then you could put it on full-random-mode and listen to it sandwiched between other artists. unless you are already familiar with wayne shorter, then i really suggest you try something else either from him or someone else (there is an extremely deep catalogue of jazz music to choose from), but if you are lookin for something for you to play in the solitude of your own thoughts, then this is it!...

(and she still might be one day...but for right now, at the age of 13, she's startin to act stupid over them triflin lil boys tryin to get her attention - pardon the digressions of an over-protective father...)where was i?oh yeah...maaaan, can you ever have anuff grover washington in your collection? these is some mellow-bluesy-grooves that JUST DEMANDS you lay back in the cut, thinkin about how beautiful life is, puttin things in proper perspective and learnin to appreciate the values of the things closest to you...

throw-back jerseys are all the rage...i mean, i love this guy's talent... as far as what's out there, musically, this is arie's twin brother...70's soul music remains my favorite... i dip into it on a daily basis/it's fundamental for me...if i want a stevie wonder record, however, i just go out and get it... this is no dis to brother donnie, it's jus that the production is SOOOO AUTHENTIC-SOUNDING in comparison to vintage stevie wonder, that the lyrics dont hold up as well...i love what he is saying: bold stuff that is badly missing from today's rhythm and blues material... i love the production... they jus dont match up well anuff for me...honestly, this will hafta grow on me (and aint nothin wrong with that... i'm willing to wait.)

first of all...i've never really been enthralled with woody allen... i've always thought he had some wit about him, but i never truly connected with him the way the critics and his hardcore fan base has...my impression was that he always thought more of his 'art' than was necessary and he somehow had convinced (or connived) us into believing in his vision also...BUT...this is a damn good movie...woody allen kinda reminds me of charles mingus, whereas you must have the so-called 'acquired taste' to enjoy his accomplishments.but 'manhattan' was more accessable than anything else i've seen by mr. allen... this is his 'ah um'...and now i find myself intrigued with watching his other works with a less critical eye.and any doubts i had about this movie going into it where honestly swept away with the ending of this/in his dialogue with ms. hemmingway... classic!and the film score accentuates appropriately... i'm not disappointed.

...i'm a casual prince fan, i understand most of what he is doin on his various albums, but if he aint hittin me with that r&amp;b-afterglow-funk, then he aint gettin my money! so when i tell people i love prince's music, this is the disc i am talkin about!! dont get me wrong, prince has many, many hits that folks cant help but love, but from top to bottom none of his other albums are jus plain as consistant as this one!! er'thang on this is funky, from the slow-burners to the pop-tunes to the rump-shakers!!! and he is in complete control of his voice with every note on this album, whisperin or screamin...man, i'd pay full price jus for disc #2 alone - i keep that one in my disc-carrier at all times, it's mandatory!! get with this classic not now, but RIGHT NOW!!!

...pimp c must have a helluva record collection to get at all of the samples the way he does. they got the lyrical skills alright, but young chad's production gets slept on! the neptunes, swizz beatz and others cant touch him. him, organized noize, gangstarr's premier and suave house's old production team are perhaps the only ones i can compare him to, skillz wise. this is a classic right here.

...these boys done f@&amp;ked around and got a triple-double with this! the production on here is rich and deep...you can play this on your granmama's ol' clock radio and its gonna make you sit up and lissen! it's true, tho, they aint sayin a whole lot...references to drugs and sex are integrated into damn near every verse! but they are so skilled in creating lyrical landscapes and the production is so tight that true hip hop fans wont complain too much...but if you want insight and meaning then check out mos def, talib, outkast or any of the old school recordings that are still out there. these boys only wanna keep it crunk.

...a lil on the preposterous side, but if you suspend belief (which is what going to the movies is all about anyway!) and settle back, then i think you will find yourself enjoying this...i cant help but to compare this movie to gilligan's island, tho...hanks plays both the professor and the skipper with 'wilson' playing the hapless lil buddy role...it drags about two-thirds of the way thru for about 10 minutes, but then again most movies drag for longer than that! buy this if you like tom hanks...if you can sit thru the 'perfect storm' then this is no problem.

let's see: a movie entitled &quot;way of the gun&quot;...proly not gonna be somethin spiritually redeeming...and it's not! it gets bogged down a couple times for a minute or so but only when the writers and them are tryin to &quot;flesh out&quot; the characters and some of the convoluted plot. but sometimes convolution is good! i didnt buy this expecting to see &quot;saving private ryan&quot;...i like movies like &quot;pulp fiction&quot;, &quot;snatch&quot;, &quot;jackie brown&quot; and even &quot;low down dirty shame&quot;...&quot;way of the gun&quot; falls somewhere inbetween &quot;snatch&quot; and &quot;...dirty shame&quot;. and i'm glad i saw it!

Junior Kimbrough, rest his soul, was the primary blues artist that brought my attentions back into the genre, so when i read that Buddy was getting back in touch with his southern roots, i was more than curious. There is some real serious fire going on here! I didnt know he could rock like this...shoot, he done definitely come stomping his boots all up and down The Crossroads, but he aint selling souls...he's buying! He got me hooked on this! &quot;I gotta try you girl&quot;? &quot;Baby please dont leave me&quot;? &quot;Stay all night&quot;?!?! Shoo-oot, Brotha Guy done lost his mind and found his heart.

...if you even find yourself this far into the exploration of jazz music, then you already are somebody who knows a lil somethin about what a beautiful thang this jungle-music stuff already is. you already know the reputations of the art-masters performing here...so the only real question you should be askin yourself is &quot;why havent i already added this to my shoppin cart?&quot; not convinced? imagine a basketball team with kareem, dr. j and jordan. a football team with montana, emmit smith and chris carter. imagine if michael jackson, elvis presley and madonna got together to make an album...okay, that's just dumb...but are you gettin what i'm tryin to say?!?! this is an excellent jazz album. once you've read up on it, or sampled some of it's songs, then there is no reason not to break down and get this....unless you jus wandered here by mistake because you was lookin for a brittany spears or lil bow wow cd...and even if you did: buy this anyway and enjoy it!

no great dialogue... no truly compelling bad guys... no fareal sense of a budding romance (chow and mira come off more as a modern day batman and robin, than romeo and juliette)... but this is jus a great all-around movie in the same way that 'new jack city' or 'the outlaw josey wales' was good... you watch it and you get addicted... doesnt always have to be a reason... it jus happens and this one has me hooked!what it absolutely has goin for it is how it incorporates two of my favorite plot elements: one, being a sense of a higher law/or some sort of affirmation of righteousness ...and two, the hero is jus the stylish [guy] we all wish we could be!

thought i was gonbe original and reference this thang to some fela funk... but brotha landsberg done beat me to it!daggonit... *sighs-to-self*isaac hayes owns the best four track soul album with 'hot buttered soul' and now brotha byrd has the best three track funkjazz disc.he opens this thang with some neo-nearly-psychodelica-jazz isht, 'the emperor' holds the body down and lets the mind out for fi'teen minutes plus some seconds... a definite trip (return tickets are now available!) and bobby and his horn does with 'jamie' what bob james and his keys did with 'angela/theme from taxi' - jus exploitin the helloutta his talents. it tracks in just under four minutes and i aint never wisht so hard for a song to continue/not like i wisht for this one to.but then byrd rolls out into 'the little rasti' and thats where the fela-isms really appear. and given the title of the album, im left with visions of a buncha brothas in berbers and dashikis /wrapped in kente and cotton and burlap perhaps, with they instruments held weapon-like across shoulders, waitin for the dawn to come so they can sneak attack um, kenny g or somebody...damn.you know this has jus GOTTA be a pretty good cd solely because it done got my review word-count up! cause i been real lazy/cuttin to the chase with my reviews lately.this is classic.

i started to give this disc only four stars, but only because i feared that the other reviewers might catch up to me in some dark alley one night! but i gotta be me and give this thang here 5 stars...it proly only deserves four, it's not a GREAT album or a classic album or anything... however, i really dont have any complaints with it... they say that 'acid jazz' has it's roots with these two albums and i think that's a justified statement... (side note: i think modern era acid jazz is nearly garbage tho!)...traditionalists need to stay the hellaway from this disc... on a whole, yall aint gonna like it... this was meant to be radio-friendly-music and i think it might appeal to the ladies (smooth jazz has its origins in this type of music also!)...if your jazz tastes lean toward the 'eclectic', then you might want to give this a try....

...most people hate a challenge, meaning a well scripted, intelligent movie that makes you pay attention to the goings-on.and you're gonna pay attention to this movie...not because the movie requires you to challenge your inner demons, but because so many levels and classes of people are represented here from many various backgrounds that you are bound to see a character that reminds you of someone you know!...del toro, cheadle and the under-rated guzman give the stronger performances along with christensen; together they offer the viewer characters to care about...but the ensemble cast is so vast, that not enough screen time is alotted to these fine actors...tsk, tsk....the good news is that with so much diversity and talent being offered they all come together like a good gumbo and satisfy most of your entertainment needs.

...these reviewer folks is right: this is a haunting, voyeuristic and reckless-eyeballin view into the soul of a hurt woman. i have owned this cd for about a year and i have been very reluctant to play it...not out of dis-interest, but out of reverence and respect....feel like i done peeped into somebody's diary and discovered they dirty lil' secrets...very touching...this aint to say that you shouldnt get this, but it helps if you are a deep-souled person yourself...very mature and understanding...(i barely qualify!!)...for those of yall who are meshell n'degeocello fans, lissen to her 'bitter' album and then imagine if she was REALLY, REALLY brokenhearted!!! - this might be what you get....

I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS ALBUM, BUT IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY TOP 10 FAVORITES REGARDLESS OF MUSICAL GENRE. I DONT PLAY IT ALL THE TIME, BUT WHEN I DO IT GETS PLAYED DAMN-NEAR CONTINUOUS FOR SOME DAYS AND SOME NIGHTS. THIS IS A SIMPLE PLEASURE OF MINE. MANY DONT EVEN CONSIDER IT JAZZ AND MOST DONT REALLY LIKE IT BUT...SO WHAT?...I ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF IT AND MOST OF MY FRIENDS DO TO WHEN THEY RELAX, OPEN THEIR MINDS AND GET THEIR HEADS OUT OF THE CLUTTER MUCKING UP R&amp;B.

this is the only cd i have ever replaced after something happened to the first one! i keep a burned copy of this cd hidden away now for just-in-case purposes...this reaches down into whatever soul i have left and rescusitates me... rejuvenates... uplifts my dead body from the cold ground and re-animates me/giving me life and reason to live... yall aint gotta be touched like that ...but if you even THINK you do, even a lil' bit... then if this cant do it, nothing else ever will... fareal...

...miss headley's voice is rich and full, no doubt... has hints of anita baker/toni braxton... the production is vintage-imitation-neo-soul (if that makes any sense!) and almost has that late 80's r&amp;b feel to it despite the d'angelo-ish 'vibe' it reaches for... think mary j. blige's &quot;not gon' cry&quot; - much of the album has a similiar sound as that song...&quot;he is&quot; is the jewel on this disc and it's what compelled me to buy this cd... a couple of other cuts stand up, but fail to stand out, mostly due to production than vocals... they follow the pre-set neo-soul formula for the most part tho. if you liked jaguar wright then you will proly enjoy some of this also!

sista done laid back in the experimental-cut with this yall...'sperimental like A STONE GROOVE... not 'sperimental like WTF?she channels many different influences with this, does a whole lotta hummin and scattin (not real deep with the lyrics on this album!)... heavily instrumental at times, somewhere between isaac hayes and some p-funk...this is different than what you might expect from an ashanti or mary j. blige or somethin... but come on now... we talkin bout the lovely ms. wright, yall know how she gets down! and tho this may not be the instant classic that her other releases are, this is waaay better than the regular r&amp;b gracing the airwaves now...this is a beautifully created conception... dont be shook.dirty.

if you love the man's voice regardless of his lyrics, then this is a 5 star achievement...but to me this album is lacking that special something that makes isley music so great. yeah, they have adult themes, but they just seem to be lacking the maturity level expected of romance and relationship music. try their BEAUTIFUL BALLADS CD or MISSION TO PLEASE; those are both great albums.

i meant to do a review of this album a couple months ago... if i had, then this woulda been me overhyping this man's mission... so as it stands today, im only gonna flat-line-hype it... this is a darn (can i say that on amazon?) good cd with the only problem being frontloaded with his best songs... actually, he only really kinda 'missteps' on two out of eleven of his songs...and the only reason why im no longer giving this cd five stars is because i played the heck outta it for the first four weeks and wore all the silver off...so, in essence, it STILL is five stars... just pace yourself when playing it.

this was about one of the first five cd's i ever bought...even tho i useta work in a music store when i was younger, i was slow gettin in the game...erick sermon got this brother on and did a pretty damn good job of producing this album. before i got into chico debarge, joe or maxwell, this is the guy i was lissenin' to. not as good as maxwell or d'angelo, but about as good as anyone else...this probably isnt even a five star release, but compared to who else was out then and how much i played this thing tryin to get my seduction on, five stars is the least that i could do! alfonzo is another brother lost in the &quot;but-where-he-at-now?-abyss&quot;. someone send a search party...he would profit greatly today if he had the exposure.

maybe this deserves to be better...'deserve' is the best and only song worth repeated listening...maybe because it's the only song that tank wrote and produced himself...he must owe the other producers some past favors to have let them put those mediocre beats on here...plus i got tired of tank shouting them out at the start of some of his songs (i guess he wanted us to know who to blame for those tracks)....on the upside, brotha tank has an excellent voice, kinda reminds me of some jeffrey osborne. the lyrics are a disappointment, sounds like some songs that destiny's child might'a rejected which is saying a lot!

...man, this is an excellent romance story! there is a good balance of honor, love, respect and restraint between the two lead characters...the chemistry is good.and as a bonus:they kick bad-guy butt!in addition to the central romance, we also get sub-romance and detective story-lines...and this is an action movie! (although there are only 3 or so real fight scenes - it satisfies sufficiently).jackie chan and jet li still remain for those of yall needing to suspend your disbeliefs with less thought or emotional input.

somewhere between curtis mayfield and maxwell, shuggie otis rules supreme!i first heard of him as he played back up for etta james on one of her live cassette tape performances (with eddie "cleanhead" vinson) that my sista let me copy... (i was about 22/23/24 years old so now yall know i been a geek for a long time now... but i love bein a geek... :P ...so there!!!)anyway, to make a stupid story short, this is some excellent "before-you-go-out-and-get-it-crunk-music" (hole in the wall 'crunk'... not teen club 'crunk'!) or "lets-me-and-you-go-back-to-my-place-and-chill-over-drinks-music" (brown liquor 'drinks'... not add sugar 'drinks'!)whatever... this is some good responsibly grown style stuff and i love the heck outta it....later yall!

...this man will huff and puff and blow your stuff down! radio will never play this and it is a bit conceptual, maybe like combining some of john coltrane's love supreme with some of pharoah sanders' work. it could take some getting use to by most people; i might even listen to it once every couple of months myself, but the purchase is worth it if only for bluiett's renditions of &quot;precious lord&quot; and &quot;wind beneath my wings&quot;. amba hawthorne's vocals on those tracks would make mahalia jackson sit up and take notice; i wish she had contributed more. but all-n-all, this is jazz related soul music and bluiett delivers.

i'm 34 years old...i grew up on late 70s and early 80s r&amp;b and soul music and then aggressively got into hip-hop. hip hop music was the music that began to expose me to the jazz classics that seldomly became sampled in the artform. i'm grateful for that and i have been an avid collector of jazz music for 15 years now. i buy music randomly and at the spur of the moment and from many artists i have never heard of...so yes, i do own a whole lot of musical garbage! but sometimes i get lucky...like this album here. this was my first ben webster album (of which i now own five) and this one still remains my favorite. this is music for a grown spirit...it is indeed warm and quiet and lush. the first track &quot;sweetheart...&quot; is a little campy for me, but after that every track is a gentle, romantic dream. this cd is ideal for loving and/or relaxing. it definitely appeals to the lover in me and fits in nicely between my isaac hayes cd and maxwell cd. in fact, i think i'm gonna go play it now, pour myself a drink and see if i can't talk someone into a back rub. buy this as soon as possible, you'll enjoy it.

...D musta fell into a coma and talked to the spirits, because this is an other-worldly effort right here...communing with the spirits of groups like BLOODSTONE and PRINCE, D'angelo done come forth breathin dust! this is even smokier and slinkier than his previous cd. I ALMOST DIDNT LIKE IT! because in the five years between his releases, lesser artists had brained washed me into liking what they were doing...BUT I'M AWAKE NOW! never again will i fall off...soul music is a powerful thing and it's revolutionary in the proper hands. this cd is a classic.

maybe he sounds a bit like gil-scott, but that's it! his label compares him to that poet and to the likes of isaac hayes and other soul and neo-soul artists... S - T - R - E - T - C - H - I - N' thangs a bit... however, the brotha gots a good voice and he on that ol' smooth-tryna-talk-some-woman-outta-her-goodies vibe...but if you are familiar with the CD from 'phat cat players' and the song they had "sundress", then i think this is that exact same guy! and if you like that particular song, then you gonna love this whole damn album because EVERY song has that exact same feel/vibe to it: steady low beats/lush smooth talkin... the atmosphere it provides is the main reason it gets a five star rating, the material isnt exactly groundbreakin, but when you need to get your mack-hussle on, then this is the disc you want playin....

(bilal could have used this type of cohesive production work on his album! i hope he kept in touch!) no overly-slicked out production for mass consumption...no TIRED @SS RAPPER SAYIN THE SAME OL' ISH HE DONE SAID ON ERBODY ELSE'S TIRED @SS TRACKS, MOANIN AND GRUMBLIN LIKE HE THINK HE WANNA BE CUTE OR SOMETHIN...(sorry, had to get that one out!)...this is jus tweet doin what she been called to do: make some fareal quality music so fresh and original that you think she done invented r&amp;b all by herself...this aint 'neo' or 'retro', but she rekindles somethin from the past, some real emotion or somethin, and smears it all over this cd...if you jus needin somethin to compare this to, then think of aretha franklin re-makin all of brother d'angelo's first album! this is a big album for me...i hope yall join in...

...i really dislike &quot;smooth&quot; jazz. most of it is not really as smooth or as jazzy as it is just plain old boring. this is the one category of music i get burned on the most whenever i purchase any...especially the ones that claim to be &quot;the greatest combination of hip-hop and jazz&quot;. there's no hip-hop at all on this cd, but the tracks here are all a shade shy from being funky and laid-back enough without being drowsy. whether you &quot;sittin back in the cut&quot;, &quot;jus' chillin'&quot; or &quot;jus' gon' marinade&quot;-this is good pre- and post-date music to conversate over...or WHATEVER it is you do.

Everyone knows that "Jurassic park I" was a classic, and with any sequel to a classic it becomes difficult to match the plot, effects, etc... (the original star wars trilogoy being the exception, and the alien sagas running a close second)... Jurassic park II was great until it got state-side then it went downhill quickly! For my personal enjoyment, this installment was much more pleasing...nothing new really happens, it has some cheap thrills & some laughs and that's about what I expected anyway. This was worth the purchase. Don't get this before you see the first one!

...my initial review only gave this girl here 3 stars...i jus wasnt feeling it at first...i had bought alotta junk cd's that week and wasnt being impressed with none of it!!but a few days ago i was sittin back lissenin to the Time (morris day, jimmy jam and em) and some old Prince...and for some odd reason i jus felt compelled to give sister Rebekah another try...dont know why, but i liked it a lil bit better that time. She didnt come across as some big, purple-passioned, paisley [person] but something about her reminds me of Prince. imagine Apollonia with insight minus the overt sexual flirtations!this wasnt a bad disc to begin with, but initially it was very hard for me to get adjusted to...this is no where near as good as Alana Davis, but i enjoy it more than i did Res' cd...if her production was a lil less alternative, then i might have enjoyed this the way i did when i first heard Esthero's disc...Rebekah is very insightful, spirited even, but dont get this expectin somethin near r&b;, soul or even neo-soul...but keep your mind open and be honest and you might find some pleasure in this....

&quot;...hold up, slow up, stop, control...&quot; big boi utters this verse on the stankonia album and i think he is referring to each of the four albums they had created. this is the one that got er'body's attention and i agree with another reviewer: you can argue which album you like the best if you want, but the truth is that each one is an obvious extension of the previous one STARTIN WITH THIS ONE RI'CHERE! you cant pick one over the other, that would be like choosing your favorite word in a sentence...every word in a phrase has importance if the message is to be understood. an outkast album is better enjoyed within the context of all of their albums! that said:this album by itself is a classic! if you aint got this in your collection then somethin must truly be wrong with you....outkast came thru combining the best of acts like kool g. rap and public enemy with ice-t and n.w.a. and they didnt just do it by bombarding us with beat-heavy funk, they added intelligence and spirit! this album is just as fresh today as it was several years ago and will still be fresh years from now! now that's a classic!

i was wildly impressed with this for the first couple of tracks...and then just mildly impressed...and then i was like &quot;ehh, it's aight... &quot;the only problem for me was that all of the remixes began to sound the same to me... it felt like i was hearing madlib over-enforce his sound onto the original recordings and he began overshadowing the fantastic pieces he presented instead of rightly complementing them...and tho i truly like much of this, it's the 'UNTAINTED' version of these songs that has my head in the clouds...props to madlib tho... as a jazzfan, i thank him for his enthusiasm... i'm just glad to see true hip hop heads still lobbying for the cause of the jazz experience!peace.

...this was a real let down...i dont read as often as i should, but i coulda started with somethin a lil better than this...there were too many characters with not enough depth to them...and the women in this are jus sad! i know many women who are very similiar to the ones portrayed here, but they aint everywhere i turn and they dont dominate my life on a daily basis like they do the male leads in this book...i know writers are supposed to provide intimate details into the lives of their characters, but there is jus too, too...too much drama! everybody got a scheme or an angle and they keep tryin to get 'ahead' of somethin or someone...what this book really needed was a good barbecue where er'body coulda got together and drank some kool-aid and some beer or somethin...these folks coulda used a good time...and me too!

Mr. Kimbrough done come thru with the dirt on this one. This aint just blues music, it's soul music right in there with Isaac Hayes and nem. It's hard played and honest and that's the true pleasure of it.

...brother warmdaddy is an excellent artist; his music on this cd is both spiritual and spirited/deeply felt. if his last name was marsalis he'd probably be the most accessable one; he has even played with wynton and i can feel some of the influence. the sound is mostly jazz-blues: slow, deliberate and mainly mellow. wes only mis-steps, in my opinion, when he goes a lil' uptempo...but over-all i think ben webster would be proud. brother anderson enjoys the traditional jazz sound, but this is his garden and he smears his mud all over it!

i bought this on a whim when it first came out, but didnt really play alot of it...it really got ignored because i was too busy tryin to build up my jazz collection at the time! i forgot i even owned it, but had rediscovered it last summer when i was clearing out some space in my cd racks and have been playin it at least once a week (a major thing!) ever since then...this is great date music or music to just sit back and relax to...soothin...mosta yall gonna feel this...

i stumbled upon this cd completely by chance...(she kinda looks like the woman im in love with/but that's beside the point... but that MAY be what first drew my attention/but i babble...)umm...completely fell in love with her 'sound'... she's a human mash-up of the middle east, india, hip hop, reggae and r&b...; i dont know whether to belly dance or break dance!(well... breakdancing might be a lil bit over the top... the 'hip hop' influence is very subtle... mostly some well placed, smoothed out 'scratching' sounds)but i'll buy omost ANY album that covers 'i put a spell on you' and as an added extra bonus, you get her rendition of 'a man's world'... fyi - only 3 or 4 of these songs are in english... the rest is either arabic or hindi or some transmogrified verbal concoction of other-worldly conversations or sumphn...im not bi-lingual... i can barely master this american dialect... ebonics be my mangled amalgamation for assonic communication of choice, butchall already know that right?umm,NATACHA...yeah...the sista sounds good... enjoyin this a whole lot better than M.I.A.'s album... this is just a good ol' fashion cd to me...beautiful.

this disc contains many various elements and styles and influences of music...that's always a good thing, artistically speaking...i like jazz...i like hiphop...i like drum and bass...i like tribal rhythms...i like good vocals...and to be honest, this cd has it all...but no one particular element dominates enough to make the various songs strong enough to stand up, let alone stand out...for the most part (outside of the roots' involvement) this makes me feel like i've been watchin an hour of &quot;barney&quot; or seseme street...this disc does settle down into somewhat of a groove at track #8.from there on, it's not too bad...but the reality is, that this disc will only make a return to my player whenever someone stops by and asks me what it sounds like...or if i need some sleep...

...res is definitely alternative!!i wasnt really feelin this when it came out...and most days i still dont...HOWEVER, this cd has grown on me....not much, but anuff to make me upgrade this release from 3 stars to 4.i cant really claim to have a favorite song here, it's all much different from what top 40 will ever play.i like esthero's album and this is reminiscent of that....this is a good album to enjoy for those days when nothing is really inspiring you or just when you feel like hearing something different when you get bored with everything else.i'm hard to please, but i'm open-minded...sometimes...give yourself some time to grow into this...a month or so from now, you might be asking yourself why you dont play this more often.(or maybe you'll make a coaster of it...who knows.)

maybe i've heard too much music... maybe it's the head-cold i have... or maybe i jus dont get it... this woman has an excellent voice (as many artists nowadays!), but i am not overwhelmed... i havent seen her live in concert as many other reviewers have so i dont have that as a guide, but jus going on her cd, three stars is all i'm feelin... this is a good release, in the same vein as heather headley - obviously these women are destined to be the next 'big thang', but when you release your best track for your first single it feels like a let down to listen to the rest of the cd......or... maybe it's jus me... :P

BLU'S VOCAL SKILLS ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND THE ONLY REAL REASON TO BUY THIS CD. HIT EM UP STYLE AND SWINGIN ARE THE TWO TIGHTEST TRACKS ON HERE, MOSTLY BECAUSE THE PRODUCERS MATCH THEIR MUSIC TO HER UPTEMPO SINGING STYLE. THE SLOWER JAMS SUFFER ONLY BECAUSE THE MUSIC ISNT LUSH ENOUGH OR FULL ENOUGH TO ACCOMPANY WHAT BLU IS OFFERING. SHE IS AMAZING; NOT THAT JIMMY JAM &amp; TERRY LEWIS AND TRICKY ARE SLACKING...BUT MORE/BETTER INSPIRATION ON THEIR PART WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY MADE THIS A 5-STAR RECORDING.

...folks are sometimes scared of jazz, i know this...and combine that with the words "afrobeat" and i guess folks jus dont know what the heck to expect... i think people expect a 'national geographic' special to jump out they speakers or somethin... i dont know; i cant explain it...yes, fela was a true activist... but i'm not gonna muse about his political experiences right now... i'm jus here for the music! i want yall to focus on that for the moment, because fela anem done did a powerful thing with this album... initially, i was turned onto the afrobeat sound when i discovered the music of his son, femi... and now i am truly converted to the sound... this rendition of the jazz sound is relaxing, uplifting and fulfilling all at the same time.cannonball adderly would have fit in rather well playin in this band... as would have anyone, from charles mingus and duke ellington to najee and kirk whalum...any serious (or beginning!) jazz fan needs some afrobeat in their collection; this aint too bad a place to start!

...there are some shortcomings in the sound quality on a couple of songs and if you are a serious Al Green fan then you probably already own most of the material on this release, especially on disc 1, but come on now...THIS IS THE BEST COLLECTION OF HIS MATERIAL TO DATE!...you have the meat of most of his classics and the gravy of some of his lesser-knowns. HERE I AM (COME AND TAKE ME) is an ultimate slow-burner for me, PLUS: HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART? RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW? this album is butter!

brother delf's 1992 release 'PONTIUS PILATE'S DECISION'!! [...]. there are ten tracks on it ranging in playin time from two minutes to twelve. delfeayo's musical ability straddles somewhere between wynton's and branford's, maybe even bridging the two. he brings his own style however and if you like the marsalis bloodline, then this will not disappoint! as for musashi, i havent heard it and didnt know it existed, but i will be adding it to my collection whenever my funds will allow!...

...and prince is definitely a nut! he scurred the hellouttame by startin this off on that smooth-jazz-vibe...(gave me chills, not the 'impressed' kind, the 'nightmare' kind!)...so after two songs i did the mature thing: i hit stop on my cd player, took a deep breath, prayed, loosened up and then i started this over with an open mind! (that's why i increased my original rating from one star to two!)i said, "okay, prince is on another level now...i gotta approach it a lil' differently now."then i lissened to the whole thing from front to back...then i did it again...........that 'open minded'... is over-rated!!!i didnt really mind the lyrics, i thought that was the best part, the synth-voice got to grating my nerves tho! but the thing that got to me the most was that the music itself was so unoriginal!!! this would have made an excellent boney james cd, boney is cool, but come on now: prince? doin smooth jazz!?!?yes, he is a nut!! but maybe this is what some of yall been waitin on cause some of yall are truly ecclectic fans, more so than me...(still, it's better than olu, tho!)...

...first of all, let me say this: I WOULD PAY TWICE AS MUCH AS THIS CD IS WORTH for track #1 alone!!! three times as much!!! 'loran's dance' - that is an awesome uptempo jazz tune and i been lookin for it since forever!! cant find it nowhere else online or in town...the entire album is excellent, specially if you like your jazz on that underground hip-hop vibe...several of the tracks are lyrically laced. and although i enjoy me some hip-hop aint noway i would think of playin this on my honeymoon!.. cam got some smoove-jazzed out pieces on here fasho, but overall, this is strictly for the bachelor party!...(honeymoon? riiiiight...like i said, cam is on somethin! somethin good, too!). yall already familiar with cam are gonna feel this...if you a newbie to this, then check out his 'mad blunted jazz' also...that disc is somethin serious!.....

this is like buffy the vampire slayer on steroids! i mean, there are splashes of blood of course (hence the term: vampire movie), but i didnt think this movie was 'gory' at all... now the effects with the way the 'reaper' mouths opened was unexpected, but AMAZING! i think the gore-factor is less in this movie than it was in the first blade movie...the only problem i have is only giving this movie 4-stars... i give the first blade 4-stars also, but blade two is far better than the original...the story line was pretty good, the effects were damn near great and overall this is just an excellent film... i look forward to the next one!

...omost well cast...the cinematography is excellent...and "ali" delivers THE BEST FIGHT SCENES i have ever seen in any movie to date!the major problem is that this movie is really all-gravy...very lil meat to it...they touch on most of the important twist and turns that ali encountered as an adult, but they do not go into any depth into those issues...example: the failure of his first two marriages, ali and his wives are shown loving and caring for each other, some tension arises - nothing openly major - and then BOOM: they divorce in darn near the very next scenes!); also ali's relationship with malcolm x seems deeply brotherly at first - ali is shown at one point running to warmly greet malcolm and then in the very same frame turns a cold shoulder to him and runs off...we know that this scene is s'pose to be reflective of the differences within the nation of islam, but the two central men at this point do nothing to discuss how this affects them...okay...basically what i'm sayin is that there is NO MONUMENTAL DIALOGUE IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!...jamie foxx does an excellent job as does jon voight and nona gaye with what they have to work with, but for a movie that lasts well over two hours i expected more...

hey now...i have to stand up for those of us who &quot;dont get it&quot; because we didnt love this movie...i get it... it's kinda cute... i think the concept for the movie is excellent... i jus cant get into the actual performances that the actors give us.this movie isnt 'confusing' as much as it is 'dis-jointed' and that kept me from gettin emotionally attached to any of the characters displayed here.tom cruise's face remains covered for much of this movie so i cant say his 'acting' prevailed and carried me thru the flaws.penelope cruz wasnt given enough screen time...cameron diaz almost has that 'glenn close quality' with this; more of her 'spurned lover' routine woulda been nice.kurt russell gives a descent performance but nothing to brag about, i liked him better in 'big, trouble in little china' (uh-oh, are yall using my taste in that movie to rationalize my opinions now? probably!).overall, this is a very well-made average movie... anyone wanting to compare this to the works of classic writers (such as kafka) proly doesnt read enough... no movie that i have ever seen has ever compared to the book it is related to (hopefully, tom hank's 'road to perdition' will break that trend).maybe if the hype hadnt been so great, my expectations mighta been a bit lowered and i coulda enjoyed it more....

first of all, understand this: babygirl had some demons to purge from her spirit and that's never an easy thing to accomplish for anyone, so i support her on that and i understand that the music presented here is a reflection of what she has went thru and has come to a personal understanding with and that she wants to share that with the universe...i get that...and lauryn, i got your back... do you, babygirl...however...(and this is the unpleasant part)... this is not as entertaining as it should be! my voyeurism does not extend into the realm of spiritual agony, even when she is in a 'joyful' mood she sounds dank and dire!i dont wanna hear that!!i have a deeply spiritual side, but mahalia jackson, yolanda adams, aretha franklin and even some son house satisfies those needs... 'unplugged' pains me to great ends... and it tests my endurance for my ability to enjoy the more ecclectic 'visions' that many artists claim to have...and it's not that her warbling vocals is the true problem, the fareal problem is that damn guitar of hers!!! come on lauryn, you coulda broke down and had somebody come in with a drum machine or some congas or even a tamborine or two jus to break up the monotony!! and having a band to back you up wont break any 'convenant' you have made with your creator ... and the fareal honest truth is that none of the songs seem nowhere near as honest as your monologues with the audience between songs, in those dialogues is where the REAL lauryn shines the strongest!!less is definitely not more with this release... we're not seekin illusions from you, ms. hill, jus some good music, good performance and the feeling that you care about your fans as much as they care for you....

(laughinmyassoff!)anyway,big boi proly has some of his best lyrics to date, the only drawback i have with his side is that it's just not enough of him; his verses could have been a bit longer and his guests just dont come off as suitable rappin-partners (not jay-z, ludicris, ceelo - none of 'em!) ... plus, his production jus seems to be just a bit off to me; i think he woulda been better served had he allowed ORGANIZED NOIZE to produce a few tracks (a &quot;gettin the gang back together&quot; sort of thing)......but that's jus me...if i had done this review a couple months ago, i proly woulda only gave this release 4 stars MAXIMUM! ...but that woulda jus been me hating on 'em... expectations were HIGH AS HELLLL for this release and i'm sad to say that i wasnt able to cope with this thang right away... big boi's side had to grow on me a lil bit... and it's still an awful hard thing to do tryin to get used to hearing the one do his thing without the other...but fareal... this thang aint nothin but gnatbootie still... tight, yall!i'm lovin it!dirt.

maaaan...where to start...hmmmm...okay...first i'll say this, this aint the most stellar of debuts, but it sho is close! lina gotsome good vocab skills, combining various parts of badu, the jazzyfatnastees, hip-hop, some blues and some old-old school jazz. it's o'most too much going on, but she carries it off quite nicely. this pro'ly deserves at least five stars, but i like my slow-burners and there's not a true ballad on this disc...and that's about the only fault to be found here. this is a whole disc similar to blu cantrell's &quot;hit em up style&quot;, but lina aint tryin ta hurt a brother's credit rating, she might put him in his place, tho...but she gets love from me....on second thought, ignore the measly lil ol' 4 stars i gave her and make this a 5 star instead!

this is pure mysticism!!somethin raw in her voice hooks you with a clarity for life and love... if you love your female jazz vocalists, then this is somethin necessary, like a lung... if you're unfamiliar with dinah and would like to get to know what she is about, then get this... there is maturity here that you will sometime need in your personal life; that's not to say you MUST have it, just sayin that you SHOULD....

they done up and did it!!!!somebody done gene spliced some atoms from craig david and chico debarge and come up with brother jones!- but it's a formula that works for him... ballads is definitely his strong point and he should stick to em... them 'uptempo' grooves remind me more of a michael jackson comeback than anything truly so fresh/so clean...but i aint hatin yall, fareal,...- this is a pretty good showing for the r&b; community!i agree with the majority of other reviewers; the hot tracks for me are 3, 4, 5 and 6 (for now - still weighin that one!)... then it kinda bogs down a bit and you find yourself lissenin,...you might even find yourself a bit bored (I DID!)... REBOUNDS VERY NICELY with the last track... track 12 is a good slow-burner fasho...a 'classic'? nowhere near it... but it has it's place and time, which is an area that many cd's fall short in - you jus play them because they somethin new! and most times i wish an artist would jus shorten their albums and go for quality, but this album needed about two other smooth tracks behind 'i hope it's you' to really have filled this one out, i woulda even settled on some remixes.this is really a strong 3 and a half-ish cd, but i give donnell the push upward because he stays consistant, plus he be wearin them hats somethin fierce!

...whoever got my cassette tape of this, when i find ya, i'ma whup yo 'butt'! my attempts to replace this here in louisville went in vain, because apparently that one cassette i did own was the only copy they shipped to this state!!...this aint as funky as the group mix (that 'society of soul' thang!), but this got me over for a minute...s.o.s. need to quit playin around and get back properly! if the dungeon family cd is any indication, then things look hopeful! this is pure-straight-garage-funk-band-r&b;, not your everyday radio version, so dont be lookin to shake it fast with this...jus that soul-noddin' music for you to slump back and enjoy!

...initially i wanted to compare ms. anders to sade or some extremely polished version of les nubians or somebody...but then she jus seemed to emerge into her own person...steppin from some shadows and morphing into someone solid...talk about laid back...this is that grown folk's chill...get with somethin fermented and someone to share it with and you got somethin beautiful about to happen!fareal, folk, i aint playin!honey's voice is butter...smooth and refined...half silk/half sugar...depending on your disposition, this will either put you in a well induced state of sleep or arouse you somethin fierce...you cant lose either way...

this has been the most engrossing thriller i have seen since &quot;seven&quot; was released! the production/cinematography is outstanding... the plot is rewarding... and the acting is compelling. if you like thickly atmospheric storytellin then this is somethin you need to look into...

the way 'fat cats', 'pimps' & 'takin these' flow one into the next, this provides hip-hop with some great story tellin not heard since ice cube's 'amerikkka's most wanted'...not hard-core or gangsta, just some classic material by one of the west's most slept on groups....

well...not as good as the first one... but a whole helluvalot better than the copycats...a couple of the cuts seemed kinda harsh and forced together... not all hip hop transfers easily into a jazzy format... the more jazzier the original song, the more success they have with their renditions...but still, overall, you can have you some good cognac moments with this one!

"ed norton miscast"? no way! his weasle-ness set the perfect mood for me... i kept expecting him to succumb to lechter's mindgames - i thought ed's character would eventually give in and do something sinister/crossing over to the dark side... i think that was a major key in why i loved this movie. and to my surprise, i even like this one better than 'silence of the lambs'!!!(cant believe i said that!)and even the tattooed sub-villain's presence is priceless (even if it is a direct copy of norman bates from 'psycho'!).i love this movie... well directed, well acted... well done.sum.

this is proly one of the most complete of all hip hop albums ever made. the production is realreal good and they spit some pretty tight lyrics...but its all just so damn consistant and doesnt really stray away into anything that takes away from it.a very solid release that will be hard for them to follow up on, but with ?uestlove off venturing into various projects right now...you never know, they might live up to the challenge....i'll be waitin, fa'sho.

...my friends know i'm proly too picky when it comes to my music and they know i aint never really been a big fan of the artist-formerly-known-as-soulchild (he jus 'musiq' now)...so er'body is jus SHOCKED that i am diggin this cd...i aint talkin bout greatness here, but aint no denying that 'halfcrazy' is a pretty good tune and the track behind that, 'time', is my ish! in fact, aint nothin but about 2 songs that i really aint feelin, so that constitutes a pretty hot release for me...there's not a lot of real development in his style but he shows some maturity on this album and cant nobody really knock that...the philly boy done did good...i'm a convert now and lookin to here more from him in the future...

pointblank:unless you've been considered a little bit 'odd' or 'eccentric' by those closes to you, you proly have no business buying this cd...i mean, there are some jazz artists that some folks jus dont get (monk, mingus, shepp, mr. ra) and they proly never will...but if you ARE one of them 'nutnuts' (as my mama might say)who like a lil more adventure in their musical preferences, then by all means......knock yourself out with this!contents:20% cry of my people...18.7% i have a dream...12.8% mingus...a whole days dose of vitamin c....05% the sub-sahara...negative X over C divided by the space/time continuum...the gulp of light rays being swallowed by a blackhole...22.3% daaaaayum, that's good...and a miscellaneous ammount of midnight......uh...nevermind...najee is over in the next aisle.

...my daughter is fourteen today! she likes the acts like b2k and ashanti and nelly... and that's fine, but she needs to have some music with some FAREALNESS about it sometimes, not just the current 'act' but somethin 'substantial &amp; lasting'... twenty years ago, i thought i'd still be playin my 'new edition' albums... but there is a thin line between 'nostalgic' and 'eternal' and my job as her daddy is to make sure she discovers it.she doesnt yet have the love for stevie that i do, but i have hope in her... she is already discoverin a love for aretha franklin, curtis mayfield and some others, so it's up to me to make sure she has access to 'the classics' as her taste developes and matures...but forget about her for now... i am still part of the ruling generation and this is a cd i love to lissen to. i bought this at first for sentimental reasons, but this ish is still good! music to grill out, chill out or whatever else it is you like to do...

i bought this not expectin 'die hard' or 'rush hour'...i wanted a good ol' fashioned movie, well fashioned and devoid of computer enhanced action sequences! and that's what i got...the plot is nothin new (crooked men doin crooked things hopin to reach that point where they can go straight - yawn, been there/done it), but i'm a fan of de niro's and of norton's ('fight club' is my ish!) and i got what i wanted from this...much better to my likin than 'the thomas crown affair' or 'entrapment'...'the score' woulda fell into the same mode as those movies if angela bassett woulda turned out to be a world-jetting, ex-c.i.a. operative turned jewel thief-informant-double agent! she doesnt...she's just a airline attendent lookin to settle down with someone she can trust and love...i'm cool with that...for those of yall that liked de niro in 'ronin', yall will proly enjoy this one just as well...

pluses: some heavy-earth-movin-cranium-crushin-ancient-civilization-spiritual-beats leavin they marks in the mud of your soul like elephant foot! her voice!-angie got the vocabs to hush an enraged man or push a quiet man to some vengence!restores some of my faith in neo-soul music....negatives: you can tell 'mahogany soul' has been deeply influenced by some of the greater true-soul artists, i'm feelin her thoughts more than her soul with this...the writing is quality, but it's not resonating in my heart after the song is gone! also, some of the production keeps reminding me of d'angelo's 'voodoo' and that proves a distraction to what she is doin...but that's not a bad thing-to be compared to d'angelo's album, 'voodoo' is still tight!overall, i think i enjoyed her first album more, but this is gonna get me thru the winter fa'sho! ms. stone has given us a near classic with this...she helped to set a high standard with 'black diamonds' and that's a difficult thing to follow up on, but go ahead sista with your strong self and keep doin whutchu doin, dirt gotcha back!

...most of this disc had to grow on me, like that hand-like parasite from the alien movies...and after awhile it did just that!!! they grabbed me by the throat and told me to pay attention!!! they on some jazz-fusion stuff, not as hard as herbie hancock's 'rockit' but related...in fact, they probably can be considered the next generation art-of-noise (a group i use to love back in the day!)...some of the music here really stands out, i'm glad to have this in my collection...

this thang here is a track meet!willie bobo is the starter's pistol setting this thing off... i like them, but carmen mcrae and astrud gilberto kinda stumble out the gate, but dinah washington picks it up and IT'S ON from there on out! the batton is handed on to sista nina (rest her soul) and there remains little speculation as to how this race is gonna end... some real flawless music from there on out......UNTIL...tony scott's thang... i love the mid-eastern feel of this joint, it's just out of place with the rest of this, which is understandable because this disc IS just made to showcase the original artists that the downtempo producers used for their remixed version...other than that, my only real complaint is that the tracks are sooo short - the vast majority being under 3 minutes (this might account for the pricing)... but for 5 bucks you really cant beat the quality and the vocal diversity this thing offers.this is 'sunday sophistication'... if you dont really appreciate traditional jazz vocalists then you should probably move on, but i strongly recommend this for true fans and anyone sitting on the fence.sum.

i've been describin this one to my friends as 'boyz in the hood' meets 'snatch'... i dont know how really accurate that is... but THIS MOVIE IS GOODSTUFF regardless...the subtitles linger long enough for you to both READ AND KEEP UP with the screen action... a rarity for subtitled movies.but this is some gritty (sometimes humorous) stuff...has all the aspects of great entertainment: believable actors, a credible script, sex, violence, love... ...well... maybe not love... but some serious infatuation...i had to burn me a back up copy in case somethin ever happens to my original... that's how deep i am with this!classic!

thats soooo daggone disappointing...*sighs to self and shakes head back and forth*brotha gil is jazz artist, point blank... classically trained... he has jazz sensiblities and he overlays his music with his black arts movement/poetic commentary.approach this with your 'hiphop off'. dont come expecting public enemy/hard beats underlying 'tear the club up' mentalities.this aint it.this is music... craft... intelligence... ...jazz.gil addresses symptoms of 'the struggle', not just who the cause of it is, but how it's affected us in the present day; he speaks on drug addiction, poverty, jazz, our children and our place in the future. ...honest & brutal... no savagery. no molotov cocktails. no black steal in the hour of chaos...(not overtly, anyway!)this bridges the gap between jill scott and miles davis...open your mind; enjoy.

i've been wrestlin with this cd for about a month now...and it's okay...no, it's better than okay...i just aint feelin this the way i'd like to. her voice is alright, but this album just feels a bit dated, like it shoulda came out in the late 80's and i hafta blame the production for that! it took a month for n'dambi to grow on me and maybe karen will too in time...this isnt a bad purchase/i dont regret buyin it and i'm glad i did...this woulda been the sh!t if it coulda came out 5 or 6 years ago when neo-soul was really catchin on, because this only suffers due to that &quot;been there, done that&quot;-syndrome.but if you like rachelle farrell's latest disc, then this one just might please you like that one, too.

...kool g. rap did this the best. it's hard to listen to an entire album that does a poor job of balancing its &quot;hard edge&quot; without humor or insight. kool g's 'live and let die' did an excellent job of pulling you into his crime sprees and sex-capades...jada kinda struggles with this....mosta the beats are pretty tight; 'knock yaself out' caught my attention and i cant hate on him for the radio friendly track 'we gonna make it', in fact that song is the one that compelled me to buy this....the guest artists on here didnt do a whole lot to improve things for me either, but i think in time jada can get it together if he can expand his lyrical content.i know he had beef with bad boy, but they mighta been a better fit for him.

if you cant see the appropriateness of quoting the rapper rakim in the review title for sun ra's poetry, then you might not want to check this book out - its definitely for the eclectic creative collector types more interested in the process of creative literature more than the academic pursuit of it (although, this book would be a great resource material for the studious academia, especially those interested in music and poetry).as a writer and artist, i find the works of sun ra very inspirational, something i keep close by when the other sparks to my creativity arent getting the job done. i mean, you're not gonna find yourself sitting over brie and wine reciting these poems to your lover (or maybe you will, if you're anything like me and you're just one-weird-individual) - the value of this collection is 1.) - its source and 2.) - the feeding of any gnawing spiritual need manifesting itself within you.if the collective works of ishmael reed and octavia butler got together to procreate a life form, this would be it.this collection could never run for president, but it would definitely make a good addition to the supreme court.(and yes, i have been away from amazon for a while - its been years since my last review; does that make me a bad person?i really try not to be...)

...back when gangsta rap was a style of expression, before it became a division of some rap-mega-corporation...like b.e.t. being owned by time-warner...this album was as furious as it was fun to listen to. cube came full-tilt with all the negative aspects associated with rap music: sexism, drug references, violence, etc.,...okay, all'a that shtuff is played out now, but the difference is CUBE REELED US INTO HIS STORIES AND WE FELT LIKE WE WAS A PART OF THEM DESPITE THE RAGE BECAUSE UNDERNEATH IT ALL WE COULD HEAR THE HUMANITY(GOOD OR BAD) AND AN UNDERLYING SENSE OF HUMOR!...in &quot;you cant fade me&quot; the issue of paternity is raised, cube drops his beer(the best sound effect on any record!) and you can almost literally hear him lose his grip on sanity before contemplating a retaliating act of immorality...then he snaps back to reality. no matter how offended we became by some of the lyrics, cube's rhymes kept us entertained and involved. nowadays, rappers have lost that art of storytelling because 1)they're more worried about representing how hard they are and 2) it just aint that much art left in it now anyway...but there are a few exceptions-mos def, outkast, fieldmob, talib.... this is still a classic album from one of rap's better lyricists. check out his 'kill at will' ep and the first half of his 'death certificate' cd-pure artform!

"bird in the hand""mans best friend""alive on arrival"- them 3 songs, rollin one behind the other, might be the best sequence of songs on any other rap album EVER!and actually, the entire first half of this album is pure classic... cube was always at his best when describing the social/urban conditions existing in america... (for his best social/political commentary, i'd hafta go with his work on the lench mob's album).but the three songs i mentioned above have continued to sound fresh and relevent over time...i have no problem comparing his commentary on this album with the likes of gil scott-heron or the last poets.libations for the lossof artists 'with somethin to say',conveying messages...

let me say this right off the bat:she got four stars from me strictly because she gives me somethin new to lissen to! (and that is no longer even true because i gave this cd to a friend of mine as a house warming present!)but i'm "ranting"... not "hating"...this disc isnt bad... it starts off slow with the first song but picks up rather nicely. i was actually quite happy with the music... toe-tappin & finga snappin ensued...but sista india does do that "lauryn hill thing" and get a bit gratuitous with her righteousness... BUT THAT'S HER THANG YALL so dont ack like you didnt know...some of the lyrics i actually like better than her first album, it's just after awhile it's all the same message - not that the message is a bad one/it just sounds like this shoulda been made by an 'arie-wannabe' and not by the up-and-coming queen herself...as a fan, i just hafta hold out until she finds her voice in variety while still maintaining the vision she has for herself...four stars is generous, but still this effort is stronger than three...

...this aint what i was hopin for...i was wantin some of that 'funky ride'/'slum beautiful' type of funk - a whole album of slump music...well, i didnt get it....BUT THIS IS STILL A POWERFUL ALBUM!!! it may not go down as a classic, but it's good anuff fa me! they build on the production they started with from goodie mob's 'world party' and slimm calhoun's 'the skinny' cd's...fast, furious and fun beats that you aint gettin nowhere else in hip-hop.this is a disc for true dungeon family fans and not just outkast fans or goodie fans...in fact, i like the hooks they sing more than most of the lyrics, but they all hold they own here: witchdoctor, ceelo, rube, society, even bubba sparxxx spits a few bars.my favorite tracks are follow the light, trans df express, on&amp;on&amp;on, forever pimpin, 6 minutes, white guts, rollin, curtains, they comin, and crooked booty...that's omost the whole album...damn!

...if yall ever wanted to see a fat man do a complete back flip, land on his toes, then slide down into hiphop spin move then yall missed it!! yall shoulda been in the record store when i saw this cd on the shelf!!(...) girl...where you been!?! a brother like me missed you...anyway, the wait was worth it...i love this girl's voice!and it's true, maybe this disc isnt as 'deep' as her first one, but i think that's because she seems to be havin some fun here instead of dwellin in some bittersweet, meloncholy mood.the overall sound is reminiscent of 'blame it on me', but definitely with a more laid back groove.but maybe i'm jus biased because i really love her voice and she could proly sing 'kumbaya' or 'row, row, row your boat' and i would like it. but for right now, i'ma play the silver off this thing, wait for her next one and then wear that one out too!

i knew of mr. shepp, but had never heard anything by him before... this was strickly an impulse purchase... (a habit i indulge waaay too often!)...but this is proly one of the top ten purchases i've bought over the past 3 years. i'ma pretty eclectic kinda cat... it can be strange, off the beaten track, 'weird' even... just as long as it feels 'honest' and 'human' to me, then i can get into it......and this is surprisingly both honest and human.bits and pieces of clunky poetry... about 5% cheesiness... 100& flawlessly mortal.how tight is this? the writer for the last cut 'quiet dawn' lets his ten year daughter do the vocals... her voice is shakey, you cant make out everything she is saying, it startles you at first... but after about ten seconds, with brotha shepp's artistry strongly backing lilsista up, this becomes the best most brilliant track on the album!if anyone knows where i can find lil waheeda (well, maybe not so little now!), let me know... that sista got a dozen roses waitin to be delivered to her!

...i dont know very much about electronica, most of it dont even appeal to me, but back in the days when i was coming up, kraftwerk (or at least this album) was considered as much a part of the hip hop soundscape as anything else. hip hop wasnt just about rappin, back then it was an outlook on life, not just how you expressed what you saw (or wished you saw) in life. i couldnt pop-lock now to save my life, but back then, we danced offa this...it was a classic. and still is.

charles mingus: you either love him, hate him, wish you loved him or really dont know what to make of him yet...that about sums him up...but on this recordin right here, i really find myself lovin him!!the first few seconds kinda started off janky...they had me scared again, 'oh no, not another complete townhall recording!'...but that first track is somethin gorgeous fareal...... this first track would be that show's ...[kickin] soundtrack!track two sounds like the f.b.i. gettin ready to come serve you a warrant or somethin...they hats tilted down in fronta they eyes, hands in they trenchcoat pockets, chompin down on cigars...if you start hearin that track outta the blue, my advice to you is to RUN!!! they finta come serve you...the third track sounds like the soundtrack to a cra@khead convention or somethin...but it's real cool, you gotta lissen to it to understand what i'm talkin about...the rest of these tracks you gotta figga out for yourself what they sound like and the best way for you to do that is by GETTIN THIS CD.....like......RIGHT NOW!!!(quit playin around!!!)bruh ron.

this thang does it for me! thanks you madlib, otherwise aint no tellin when i would have discovered the works of brother andrew hill; his 'illusion' is vying for the position of my all time favorite jazz piece... over duke el's 'in a sentimental mood' and charlie parker's 'night in tunisia' ... there are many excellent songs on this thang! a few most jazz fans are familiar with already, but if you are NEW to the artform, then PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!! begin with this... it is a treat for any dirty-jazz-head like me.peace yall,brotha ron.

...this is the cd that actually made me get up and go make me a pot of fresh greens for the first time. ham and hot peppers and shtuff...it was good! anyway, i really dont know how to categorize this cd...it's different from even contemporary blues standards...o'most tracy chapman-ish or n'degeocello-like but funk free. it's gritty without growlin' and fun without being all the way campy...does any'a that make any sense?...&quot;sweet black angel&quot; &amp; &quot;just a closer walk with thee&quot; are the stand-outs. the rest of the cd kinda sways around ragtime, hip-hop and maybe the songs from HBO's multi-cultural fairy-tales cartoon. it's eclectic and might take some gettin use to, but still, the biggest drawback is that i would have prefered one or two more songs...the interludes can stay...just more music woulda been nice.

'cello is coming from and bringin with her some love and some wasted love...but with her spirit all up in this, this release is a beautiful thing to hear and behold.her despair and pain here is so honest and clean that the overall effort ends up upliftin me...and actually even turns me on! the soul is a sexy thing when displayed in the real, and meshell done laid her's out rather nicely.

oh yeah!this was a tight flick yall... "the sixth sense" was predictable to me and i had pretty much figured that out from the beginning... but this movie!?!?! the others!?!?!? man...normally you sit back and try to super-sleuth durin the lulls in the movie, but they dont really offer you many opportunities to do that with in this one...very suspenseful...BR>well acted...and actually pretty scary!!! my 13 year old spent the night in her mama's bed after seein this one...(and she had jus seen '13 ghosts' two weeks ago and was braggin bout how good that movie was...but she loves this one even more! FROM A 13 YEAR OLD YALL!!!)the ending was a complete surprise to me and had me completely perplexed up until the final few frames... this is a great date movie, but i gotta get this one for my collection as soon as possible...

i admit it...charles mingus has always intimidated me...i have other music by him, a live disc that even his die-hard fans have criticized and a compilation of blues and ballads that i only enjoy in spurts......nothing that i have bragged about to others...just kinda ho-hum...but mingus has always remained one of those musicians that i have felt compelled to dig into to find out what all of the fuss was about...i'm glad i kept diggin and didnt stop with those other recordings because this is some truly enjoyable music being played here! for those of yall with similar encounters with mingus as i, or if you are just looking for that first album of his for you to get into, then let me recommend this one for you; you'll either be satisfied and stop with this purchase or very pleased and urged (as i) to dig deeper into his other classics...

(soapbox session #1)...i been a hip-hop fiend for over 20 years (WHOA, SH!T, I'M GETTIN OLD!!)...and yeah, the Golden Age is over...we aint gonna see that slew of emcees comin out like they use to with their own sound, lyrics and production. that era is dead. today, you pretty much hafta belong to a &quot;label&quot; - a certain group of producers who will stamp their &quot;sound&quot; &amp; &quot;approval&quot; to your project, thus justifying you as an artist. that's so sad. &quot;labels&quot; aint hungry...they jus wanna maintain whatever prominence they have already reached, mostly at the cost of creativity.that's not the case here!! this is some authentic stuff...they got some strong hip hop beats and they actually rely on a &quot;dj&quot; to provide their music and not a &quot;producer&quot;...and Gift-of-gab is a strong emcee...this is tight and now i have to own their full lenght cd...yall should proly get it too, unless youre wantin some super-glossy, over-flossy top 40 hip-pop, then maybe you better off with the above-ground stuff.

this is about one of the best all around cd's to have come out within the past 5 years! this is within the same realm of artists like Joe and Chico Debarge or maybe even R. Kelly and K.C. &amp; Jojo...but for me, better...more consistant and heartfelt. it's all good r.n.b ranging from tales of hustlin' and lust to love and commitment. THERE IS A WHOLE, WHOLE, WHOLE LOT OF MUSIC YOU CAN DO WORSE THAN BY PURCHASING IT, BUT THIS CD DELIVERS! it wont disappoint you, even when it slips which isnt often. they got some skills and they succeed in making the best of them.

...i'm jus no good at pickin up a 'simple' read...i seem to thrive on difficulty...and this book was certainly difficult! but not because of how it's written or the language...this book challenges our pre-packaged assumptions of what &quot;real&quot; literature should be about...the lead character omost has as many flaws as myself, but he is not an 'evil' man or even a 'wrong' man...he's jus someone livin his life within the realms and realities of where God has chosen to place him...the culture clash will throw you to the floor! but not the obvious one between african and european societies...i'm talkin about the riot of forces existin within myself debatin, arguin and/or jus bein plain indignant as to which side of the cultural fence i really find myself on...revolutions within a society pale, falter and fail immensely in comparrison to those that occur within yourself...

...ackshully, i want'd to use a lil stronga language than 'darn' but amazon be done had a fit then and hauled me up on some charges... it's 2005 and my resolution was to be 'case free' for AT LEAST 6 months...okay... thats waaay off topic... my bad.lizz fields (not to be confused with lizz wright/which i've accidently done on a couple of occassions) has been a bright spot amongst some of my more recent purchases.she dint start off that way tho! ... i thought, "daggone... not ANOTHER phillysoulsanger... sh(oo)t!!! they shakin that tree a lil too often now!" i was quick to compare her to a younger jill scott (like jill is all'a the sudden ancient or somethin!), but they DO sound awfully similar at times... but is that such a bad thang, i mean REALLY now???? ... so after i got off my high horse and played this thang for more than a couple of days, i really became impressed with this lil sista's skills......"purrtydarngood" comes back to mind...the production has grown on me and i think that might be the only real thang preventin me from givin this five stars, but everythang on this is muchmuch better than what you'll find on your fm radio stations or video channels...neo-soul has become such a bad word nowadays... but it still remains one of my most favorite sounds. the problem with 'neo-soul' has more to do with the 'gimmick-try' of it and not the honest down to earth artform it should be.this aint that "late night lounge/girl, you gonna mess around and meet my mama" smoothness im accustomed to, but you can still lay back in the cut with this... maybe get a lil dreamy eyed all by your lonesome or reminisce on some romantic-ish with your favorite lil somebody-you-like......lizz does her thang on this... you caint expect her to give any more than the heart and soul she displays with this release.AND PLUS SHE SPORTS AN AFRO on the cover... and yall KNOW how im a such a sucker for that!peace.

&quot;opera&quot;... this cd has the same fascination with me as actual opera singing: my attention is held jus long enough to decide that what i'm lissenin to is good, but at that point i feel the need to move onto somethin else... this got some serious stereo time for about three days and that was that (about 3 and a half stars actually)... the 'suzuki' disc is far more enjoyable than this one, but if you have a quality multi-disc cd changer then you can probably find some room in it for this once you set it for 'random play'...

of all of the jazz that i own, this is perhaps my overall favorite...not because it is avant-garde or ultra-cool or tryin to be cute: this is just original, down to earth music that pays homage to the tradition and culture of its influences.i use to play this for my child, who was a year old when this came out, hoping to instill in her a sense of purpose and spirit.like true hip-hop, jazz wasnt created for its own sake to propel its own glories into the psyche' of music purists....all music doesnt have to be pretentious or popular or artsy to be accepted; this is just an extension of culture to how people use to live and celebrate the things around them good and bad. marsalis reflects those elements nicely with this.

im the first reviewer hunh? ...thats a big responsibility, cause yall gonna hafta live and die with my advice solely to advice you... daggone... the pressure is mounting...but sumbodygotadoit...build an ark is a california jazz collective... i had never ever heard'a em till i purchased the cd (luckily the store i get my music at allows you to lissen to the albums before you buy them!) ...i proly shouldnt have used 'garage' in my title description, cause that might imply 'funk' or 'soul' to many people, when actually these cats is cool and laid back with how they approach their music; no pfunk 'funky' but no where near 'smooth' jazz status either. more 'tribal' with their sound/semi-spritual or bohemian in their approach.drums and flutes are their primary instruments.i'd reference them along the likes of archie shepp's 'attica blues'... soel's 'memento'... fertile ground's 'seasons change'... alice coltrane's 'journey in satchidananda'... yeah, pharoah sanders would fit right in with these folks, mosdefinitely!18 tracks; 63 mins and ten seconds of music with only one real mistake, their rendition of 'pure imagination' (blaaah! that's right, the willy wonka and the chocolate factory song! keep havin annoying visions of gene wilder and that big purple hat of his!!!! what was they thinkin???...like i said, BLAAAAH!!!) ... this would have gotten five stars from me, but a couple times they seem to push the envelope towards 'boring' than 'creative'... but not a bad purchase overall, if you dig the eclectic.

i have watched well over my fair share of garbage movies... luckily, this aint one'a em.then again, 'red siren' will NEVER win any awards either!maybe my reason for lovin this lil movie so much has somethin to do with psychology. 'cause i had rented it first, but the dvd had glitches at what i thought to be two key parts of the flick and i had to skip those chapters, missin out on what was bein said or done. dammit.so, whats the first thang i do??? i get online and find out that amazon has it for under ten bucks... shoot, i owe the movie rental place TWICE that much in late fees!so i went on and bought the damn thang, naturally.but i enjoy this movie primarily for the same exack reasons that the others didnt: it asks the viewer to be acceptive of the discrepencies and just sit back and watch already. i watch real good; i should be paid to do it, but that's another story.um, but yeah, i like it. doesnt come off pretentious in any way. it jus does what it does without begging for forgiveness.(catering to the needs of others is somethin else i do real good. i hate that about me sometimes, but such is life, right?)'the professional' WISHES it was this movie! that was a good flick until the hitman turnt into 'old uncle molester'... that disturbed me.but if you liked movies such as 'the replacement killers' or 'long kiss goodnight' or, um, any of the new star wars trilogies then you'll love this one too.

ALANA OFFERS A DIVERSITY OF SOUNDS ALL UNITED BY HER SOUL AND SPIRIT. R&amp;B WITH ALTERNATIVE AND JAZZY VOCALINGS. SHE MAY NOT BE EXACTLY FROM THE SAME MOLD AS JAZZYFATNASTEES, AMEL LARRIEAUX OR N'DAMBI BUT THEY ALL USE THE SAME SPOON. A SOPHOMORE ALBUM WAS DUE A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK BUT I DONT KNOW WHY IT NEVER DROPPED. THE LYRICS ARE GOOD AND THE MUSIC AND THE VOICE...NOTHING IS OVER-HYPED. ALL THE SONGS ARE DEEP AND HAVE A MESSAGE BUT ITS ALL PERSONAL AND NEVER PREACHY. THINK ALANIS MORRISETTE WITH SOUL OR FIONNA APPLE MEETS ERYKAH BADU.

i bought 'ethnomusicology 1' strictly based off'a how cool i thought the album cover and name of the disc was... and plus a dj was involved too???? well, you know me, I HADDA HAVIT...my emotions at that time were mixed... i'd love it for a little while... then would loose interest just as quick. after two years of flipfloppin, i eventually settled for the 3 dollars the book and music exchange was willing to offer me for it.yeah. i sold out.i think i had another gunn cd, but i cant for the life of me remember what i did with it... either that, or im dreamin i had it...either way, this one more than makes up for it!a real strong four and a half stars fareal...and yep, the dj is still there... not sure if its the same one tho. the dj on the first 'ethnomusicology' was pretty damn good, if i remember correckly... the dj's role with this project is much less obvious - pretty much muted and not used as effectively as he coulda been and omost hinders the final track.the overall mood of this disc is reminiscent to me of the branford marsalis quartet's 'requiem'... not as strong, but just as musically diverse.this cd keeps mr. gunn in the game.i'm eagerly awaiting further releases from him now and will proly go back and check out some of his other previous works.this is nice and well worth the time and energy.

...my "true" jazz collection back in the early 90's consisted mostly of shirley horn, grover washington jr., some terence blanchard, courtney pine, stanley clarke and marcus roberts...any other jazz that i owned was proly some fusion or smooth jazz/jazz-funk stuff...stuff that i really dont get into much anymore...but i remember gettin this on cassette when it came out and it was like the crown jewel of my jazz collection! when i wasnt playin my public enemy, de la soul and ice-cube cd's - when i wanted to lissen to somethin "grown", then i played this damn-near to death! i really credit this album (along with ones from the above mentioned artists) for nurturing my growth into the realm of (not jus jazz, but) good, quality music...period!and so the addiction began...

...i feel sorry for performers who get locked into the images they create of themselves, especially when they fans start becomin critical of any changes...he was on cable promotin this album as his most 'grown' or 'mature' (in a millie jackson type of way i guess)...but i see what he was sayin...but the reality is this: jus how many different ways can the same artist sing about the same material over several albums?mystikal pretty much follows thru with the same formula as he did on the other ones - givin us 3 or 4 real tight cuts and 3 or 4 so-so cuts and 3 or 4 you jus wanna skip thru (mostly due to poor production)...he's the busta rhymes of the south, whereas he has mad-charisma and personality and it jus gets hard for him to musically live up to the hype that is set up around him...uh...and anyway,...this aint too bad...he pretty much gives us the same as he always has...(i'm jus waitin for him to release a 'greatest hits' cd!)...

there are many, many different sounds on this cd other than a real honest blues effort...but mr. burnside's voice provides that thread that connects and binds.that's the good news...unfortunately, it's mostly all overproduced, manufactured for the party college crowd...that's not a bad thing, but i hate to see a musician of r.l.'s talent be the lamb sacrificing his good name for the sake of profit.blues-wise, the best tracks on here are &quot;wish i was in heaven...&quot;, &quot;my eyes keep me in trouble&quot;, two of the three hidden tracks: &quot;black mattie&quot; &amp; &quot;laugh to keep from cryin&quot; and &quot;bad luck city&quot; which has a strong hip-hop kick to it---cash money millionaires might find themselves making these types of tracks 30 years from now!fat possum has a strong stable of good, hill-country juke music...this isnt one of them, but the tracks i do enjoy made it worth the purchase.

...you know how it goes, you hear a few good things about some cd, but nobody you know owns it, you keep pickin it up...only to tell the cashier at check out that you aint gonna get it right now...so you buy only the stuff you are sure about! (but your decision not to get it keeps naggin at you...naggin at you....)dont lie yall; yall know yall did that too...well, i finally broke down and got this and this is more gorgeous than i ever thought it would be...my only regrets are buyin the cd's i picked over this...the blend of jazz and electronica is damn near perfect, i cant believe this hasnt made it's way to more main stream outlets. i dont know anything about moby, but i love dj cam's 'mad blunted jazz', tosca's 'suzuki', anything duke ellington, john coltrane or miles davis and isaac hayes...i have about five hundred cd's now and this is one of my top twenty!! get this yall...it's worth it!

first off, this isnt 'genre-busting'... i dont know where i'd go to classify this, but it's earthy, full and rich... very layered and has a lovingly nappy texture. organic.if i still believed in 'neo-soul' then i'd say that this would either be 'the origin of it' or the 'elevation' to it... guess that jus makes it 'soulful'... not as 'jazz heavy' as what you might expect coming from the st. germaine camp...ummmmm, soel's album is comparable to archie shepp's 'attica blues'... contemporary to groups such as fertile ground, the pharaohs (extinct early 70's souljazz group/the roots of earth, wind and fire), gil scott-heron, alice coltrane...or imagine if cinematic orchestra, roy ayers, isaac hayes , george clinton and fela kuti all came together to create an album......yeah, that might define it for me...i buy 5 to 8 cds a month, at least, and this will go down as one of my top ten purchases for 2005... a great weekend album to lounge around with cultured friends.peace yall,dirtyboy.

this is an excellent jazz cd that incorporates traditional and contemporary styles with jazz an ounce or two of hip-hop. mr. bartz is all over the place with this ranging from ballads to reggae to some hard bop! at the time, amazon has this in limited supply, but if you can get your hands on it you'll enjoy it.

...i have factory speakers in my neon(cockroaches of the car industry-they everywhere, damn) so you know that i aint vibratin' the concrete so much...but i sho' as hell try to bust a speaker, if not an eardrum, playing this cd. it's one of those RARE, RARE, RARE old school hip-hop cds that remains just as fresh today as it did back then. ten years from now, outside of outkast, i'm not gonna remember who i was listening to in 2001, but i'll still be listening to this!

...i loved his role in &quot;o, brother where art thou?&quot; and that is what prompted me to pick up this disc, the brother has skills...he just didnt showcase them here in a proper fashion.his blues joints on this are tight...and although i love me some hip-hop(and his raps aint all the way bad) it takes away from what i was expecting. he has another cd based on his &quot;o, brother...&quot; character which is probably more of what i want to hear; i will be gettin that cd soon.this isnt a bad cd, just not what i was expecting...hard to be up for some serious blues and then not get it; that's a true heartache!

...much love to nicolette for providin me with the coolest album title in my collection!but:i wish someone in my head WAS payin rent, maybe they could have advised me to stop bein so damn eclectic and for me to buy somethin i REALLY been wantin, like eric b. &amp; rakim's 'paid in full' cd....damn....anyway, she aint bad...comparin her to billie holiday is a stretch, but not entirely far-fetched...i'm feelin that comparison. nicolette has that dreamy, wispy, whispery vocal-delivery-thing down pat, she excels when she reaches down into that gut and pulls out them buttery, guttery, guttaral, near-lustful moans...i dig that...the biggest flaw for me is that the production is so damn sparse; her voice is cute and all but a few extra bells and some hand claps mighta helped this out...not no p-funk or anything...but some 'snap' woulda pushed this thru for me.

i love their name... their covers... album names... the way they market themselves... THEY SHOULD BE SOME FOLKS I DIG. ...and i've tried.bought a couple albums...did a review or two...recieved harsh criticism as feedback from a TC member...(so, they are lissenin to what yall hafta say, believe that!)but time and time again ive been... UNDERimpressed with their work... (just as they're underimpressed with me in my previous assessments of them)...however... with all that said and done, this might be they most solid effort in my unprofessional opinion...i didnt purchase this album, but i got to lissen to it before hand... and i camethisdaggoneclose to buyin it....i couldnt make myself do it just yet. gonna hafta sample it some more i think. but prognosis is good.as i said, IM NOT A DIE-HARD FAN of these boys, but i think they have mad-talent!...i'm very eclectic when it comes to the music i enjoy and their only failing has been not being able to produce a solid enough record that appeals to ME.i guess whatever it is that appeals to me is the same reason that their 'truer fans' seem to be a little less thrilled about it.but for those of us lookin for somethin new and outside of our usual inclinations, then this might (or might not!) do it; but it's worth the money if you're feelin experimental and open to somethin different.not as 'loungey' as their other work to me... and as an interested party, i appreciate that.see, old dogs be learnin somethin new er'day.

'whats a telephone bill', 'munchies...', 'cant stay away'... !!!! ... !!!! ... !!!! ... yall dont hear me tho... this is some classic funk thats gonna still be stankin like that up until the Rapture yall... stop missin out, yall know yall need yall daily doses of funk and this thing here fills the bill nicely...

most times i like my music soulful or jazzy or sometimes completely gutter!this album combines jus about everything i love about people who make good music...breakin it down into its basic components, i say this disc is 50% some coltrane (body and soul), 40% some k.r.s.-one (ghetto music), 10% some p-funk (chocolate city) and some extra-secret-percentages of james brown/maceo parker and public enemy!(mos def, jaguar wright and common DO make appearances on this!)...i omost never completely tell folks that they should buy one cd or another, but all conscious minded people should own this!this will be enjoyed in private moments or at social gatherings equally (depending on the quality of people you roll with!)....

...this cd has its moments, but just as you settle down to enjoy one of them - BAM - they up and mess somethin up! taborn is talented as are the other two members in the trio, the only problem is that they do not play cohesively...on the majority of the songs, they all seem to be playin against each other and not together. it's omost like they overlapped 33 songs over 11 tracks (lissen to one, get two more free!)...i imagine them all colliding in the hallway on their way to the studio, sheets of music flyin up into the air and no-one taking the time to sort things out before they began recording....they do calm down some for the last 3 tracks, but gettin there was rough.

honesty and love are two hard things to come by even seperately nowadays, especially in music, but Dave gottem joined at the hip on this one. If he had dreadlocks or hailed from britain, he would have been all over the magazines labeled as the next saviour of soul or neo-soul, but alas he's just r&amp;b-a regular brother from the streets.

where most new artist have a 'voice' (viv green; heather headley) that shines best with better production, goapele offers us a 'sound'... her voice has... um... 'atmosphere'... establishes a mood between seductive and relaxed... most of the tracks here blend seamlessly, one into the next, which ends up being the only drawback to this disc... you do crave for a bit of diversity (but not until after you done wore the cd out!!! plus, that's why they make a multi-disc cd changer!!!)add this to your collection... it'll come in handy one day!

Chris Williams was definitely a man for the streets and the everyday-man. nowhere near crass, but honest and sincere and deepfelt: the 1990's version of teddy pendergrass, who was a definite influence. a whole lot of soul gets served up on this disc and there is not ONE track on here to be negatively critisized. i know you use to have this on tape cassette and you loved it, so stop being hesitant and get this on cd already!

AVERAGE...the dialogue isnt engrossing and the character studies arent as deep as i expected... (cept for the pregnant chick, i liked her character and wish the movie woulda involved her a little more)i mean, i was STUNNED with just how UNSTUNNING this movie actually was...im not even gonna get into the 'why he gotta be a pimp?' argument...(but why?!?!? - us industrial bakery workers dont have a story to tell? - mixin this water with flour is rough business maiyne!)but tho hustle and flow is kinda predictable, i wasnt dissappointed; it's worth watching... once. anything morethan once might prove a little difficult tho.good luck.

...most combos of jazz and hip hop fall way too short of expectations, it's too much of one and not enough of the other.dj cam's 'mad, blunted jazz' probably is the best cd out there to really fuse both together and create something truly original....this album runs a close second, but it's not really jazz music so much as it is rap instrumentals played with jazz instruments.it's smooth jazz with a kick! excellent music to sit back and slump to; conversate with a friend/politic with a partna/spit game to co-ed over this...play this for any occassion and enjoy.

"they dont make em like this no more..."well... you can throw that phrase out the window, because they DID!!!this is the movie, that if i were still a kid, i'd be done tied a bath towel around my neck like a cape, dashing thru my mama's house pretending the broom was a sword... making swooshin' sounds as i hacked a man down!this movie is so good, it brings back memories i aint never had!ahhhh, what coulda been!but it's not too late for us... we got this movie to fuel our imaginations... this is original-star-wars-type-classic... you gotta get this.sum.

...i'm really just getting into &quot;downtempo&quot; music, so i'm kinda new with this, but damn! i dont wanna ever fall asleep while driving again!! every song starts off potentially great, but does &quot;downtempo&quot; mean &quot;repetitious&quot;, also? if you want to really, really, really relax then this cd will definitely do it...and i might play it again one day soon, but not by myself. some company is definitely required if you plan on doing anything else besides taking a nap. ON THE PLUS SIDE, HOWEVER: the songs that have vocals are pretty good, if the majority of the album was like this i mighta gave it closer to 4-stars.

i'm not a big fan of most contemporary blues singers, prefering that stuff they got goin' on in the mississip; pr'oly at best a 3anahalf-star rating, but seriously, Taj got that deep-from-some-gutter type sputter/growl goin' on and when he sings them love songs of his, it's some real hot stuff. &quot;here in the dark&quot;, &quot;fanning the flames&quot; and &quot;love her with a feeling&quot; are THE MOST SENSUALLY HOT BALLADS FROM ANY MALE ARTIST OUT THERE, R-N-B OR OTHERWISE! neo-soul cant e'en come close to the dirt and desire in those cuts! this is the artist that D'angelo will be inspired by 10 years from now.

THIS IS JUST A PURE PLEASURABLE LISTENING EXPERIENCE. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE JAZZ RECORDINGS...I HAD THIS ON CASSETTE BUT I FOOLISHLY LET A &quot;FRIEND&quot; BORROW IT...HE SAYS HIS DADDY (A FORMER MUSICIAN WHO USE TO PLAY WITH CANNONBALL ADDERLY) LOST IT!! YEAH, RIGHT....ANYWAY, I'M GONNA GET THIS ON CD ASAP...IT'S PRETTY GOOD. NOTHIN' SMOOTH, JUST JAZZ.

...it took a woman who mastered her artform from 25 years ago to get me to appreciate the music being made today!! i was all &quot;neo-souled-out&quot; until i discovered this woman!! ms. mason is in the same mode as isaac hayes, but much of her style reminds me what erykah is doing now...this is much better than my millie jackson, betty wright or marlena shaw cd's...it should be punishable by law that urban radio stations dont devote some of their airtime to more music like this....

Pru's ability as a poet is not at question here; she is a gifted writer...but...her style just doesn't cross over musically. i enjoy a variety of sounds and styles, this just ain't one of them...but then again, maybe i'm just one of them &quot;simple&quot; people that another reviewer refered to. Meshell Ndegeocello and Cassandra Wilson offer &quot;deeper&quot; experiences for me; Syleena Johnson provides that gut-bucket funk, but if you like Pru may i suggest Alana Davis or Adriana Evans...their albums are very excellent.

...mary been carryin that 'no more drama' banner since this cd came out! the exception is that besides puttin her heart and mind into this album, she truly put her SOUL into it!!! yall can feel it!!! whatever nonsense was brewin in her life at this time lead to some truly inspired craftsmanship between her and puffy...she sings the blues honestly on this and you can feel it in her voice that she still has that hope and confidence that things are gonna work out..., mary tears it up!!! no lie!...this is my favorite...when she says "i'm the only woman" i believe it and yall will too...

you know... despite what is all said and done, this is nowhere near 'hiphop'... closer to some idris muhammad or some early grover washington than anything associated with hiphop... brother common does lay down a tight freestyle (feels like a freestyle anyway!) and Q-tip does alright, he coulda done better... but this has a greater neo-soul feel through-out it, more than anything else... the entire cd's got that 'earthy' feel to it/not bass heavy... just sets a groove/has a 'feel'...d'angelo's version of &quot;i'll stay&quot; sets off the whole album for me... it's a must have for that reason alone!this aint gonna appeal to the traditional jazz fans or even most 'smooth' jazz fans... this falls somewhere inbetween, but slightly akimbo (i love that word, fareal yall!)...roy doesnt try to mesh urban sounds with jazz stylings (or vice versa!)... those mutations seldom work... what he did here was take the overall concept of 'good-music' and decide to have some fun with it... and it works!

...christian mcbride is okay, but not a particular favorite and i just about love er'thing else that brother ahmir done put his hands on, from his roots work to them jazzyfatnastees (an extremely hot cd!)...but this cd is just plain boring! it feels like nobody was really willing to step up and assert themselves on this or they were afraid to suggest anything too experimental (hypocrits!)...i was so hyped to hear this, i bought it the day it came out - a week later i think i pawned it....dont get me wrong tho, i think this is an excellent concept, i just hope the next time they get together they challenge the audiences of both hip hop and jazz and avoid the middle-of-the-road-material.dj cam has a great hiphop-jazz disc heavy on samples and drum machine called 'mad blunted jazz', that's a great disc. also, the hidden beach has a very decent cd that covers jazzy renditions of hip-hop classics. and for more original stuff check out medeski, martin and wood - especially their mid-1990's work.

i'm sorry, but mary j. aint been the mary j. that i prefer... i like mary better with some drama! whats wrong with some good ol fashion drama anyway???and for that matter, what is wrong with some good ol fashion passion!!?? amerie is very reminiscent of ol-school mary j. bringin us that devoid-of-real-issues-summer-love-fun... i aint got no problem with that... (will i be playin this cd late into the year? - proly not, but in the warmer months? yes!!)an excellent debut!

thank god for the international film channel... they have 'samurai saturdays' where they show asian classics such as this. im hooked now and hafta get my collection started.this is my new addiction.the versions i saw were all originally in black and white, but recently they aired the third installment and it looked like someone had ATTEMPTED to colorize it... i thought it was god-awful, but that's not enough to keep me from gettin this collection. it did detract some, but the story lines are so good, i cant resist.i hafta have this. american cinema falls waay short of this type of story telling.

...there is such a diversity of sounds on this cd that i cant e'en begin to think straight...but mostly that 'latin-jazz-funk-s#it' boils, bubbles and stews up under er'thang!this borders between some nightclub music with women in high-heels and long skirts (with side slits!) out on the dance floor shakin they thang under some pulsin red lights...or...some music to clean your house to when you couldn afford to go out that night!the female vocals on this done pierced a hole in my head with they loud, strong voices...roy ayers does his thang here (but only a couple of songs! - dag!)...my man, jazzy jeff tears up his cut (wish it was longer, he needs to come out on his own now that his production squad done pushed jill scott into the atmosphere!)...this is some tight work...i've had this since it came out and i still make sure to get this out and play the dust offa it, usually on my sundays when i play my 'reverence' music (gotta have a day set aside for some 'reverence'! - cant be thugged out and gangsta-fied alla the time!)...later for yall,bruh ron.

havent written very many reviews lately... mostly jus because i havent been inspired to do so, although there are many albums out there that im feelin right now... ...chalk it up to laziness. it wouldn be the first time.been spendin vast amounts of my free time scroungin thru the various local music stores lookin for somethin... ...me-definitive... done picked up a whole lotta funkadelic, some underground rap (mf doom, haiku d'etat, some jon doe remixes, etc), not anuff jazz as i would like (open for ideas, yall)...anyway... ...i was finta get john legend's cd when i come across this thang herre and you know me, rather go with the 'unknown quantity' than the 'next new hyped sensation'... no disrespeck to john l, tho... i'll getchu next time dude, i swair on a stacka apples!now, how do i describe this thang herre??? ...dont know.how bout: low-key-earth-level-nearly/non-neo-soul music?(shoot, that works for me!) brotha aint got the bestess/smoothess voice, but he has his own sound and is pretty darn masterful with it. ...let's call him the male version of amel larrieux! i think thats a real good comparrison yall....some sunday music; not gospel, not sacred, but definitely self-respective. the brotha's alright with me.

looks like folks either love it or hate it... mostly, looks like they jus disgruntled with the sound quality... and yeah, it could sorely use a sonic upgrade!'free your mind', 'maggotbrain' and 'standing on the verge' are the holy triumverant of funkadelic records, in my book. pure and uncommercialized... nothin experimental feelin at all... jusbeautiful, garage band jam. no preservatives added.the masters of funk at their zenith.

yes... this is indeed 'short' in length...BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER THIS WAY... meshell was definitely in a loving mood when she composed this album; the songs kinda merge quietly into the next, omost giving it the feel of one huge entire song... the forty minutes pass, but you feel satisfied with the experience.i wish many more artists would go back to shorter lengthed albums... the filler is a killer, fareal. but meshell came lean with this one... and i have absolutely no regrets about that!this is beautiful...imagine a musical melding of pfunk's &quot;i'll stay&quot; with bob marley's &quot;turn your lights down low&quot;... sistagirl did a good thing with this one yall; get it!

THIS WOMAN DEFINITELY COMES CORRECT WITH THIS ALBUM...SHE HAS A VERY POWERFUL VOICE ON A CHAKA KHAN-TYPE LEVEL; I ABSOLUTELY HATE &quot;KEYS&quot;, AND MUSICALLY EVERY TRACK SEEMS VERY REMINISCENT OF SOME OLDER R&amp;B CLASSICS...IT KIND OF DISTURBS ME TO BE DIGGIN INTO ONE OF HER SONGS AND THEN TO FIND MYSELF DISTRACTED BY THE ENGINEERING BECAUSE IT SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO SOMETHING ELSE. NO SAMPLING CREDITS ARE LISTED, BUT STILL....ANYWAY, LATANYA MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR ANY SLIGHT FLAWS ESPECIALLY ON THE SLOW-BURNERS. NOTHIN EXPLICIT, BUT DEFINITLEY HEATED, COMIN THRU WITH THE CHANTE'-MOORE-ISMS.

...an honest effort from a young woman with potential, but...the production effort is just lazy! maybe that was the intent, but it hurts more than it succeeds. probably just a 2-star rating, but i like the fact that she is trying to do something unique and that alone makes her rare. my piano-playing daughter loves this immensely, so what do i know?

...it is raining fiercely outside, and although i thoroughly enjoy the rain...instead of just being gray, today just seems gloomy....and then i put this into the cd player!!this is a studio album, but with the warmth and joy that these men are playing with, you'd think that you were in some exclusive night club...nothing here that i would consider avant-garde, just some jazz men enjoying their chosen craft!hamiet bluiett on baritone sax leads this four man ensemble, joined by nasheet waits on drums, jaribu shahid on bass and ed cherry on guitar. they put in work and the outcome is some of the best true jazz that anyone living has recently made.mr. bluiett's style is like taking coltrane's skill and applying it to miles davis' sensibilities!! a true pleasure.

i bought this cd back around '97 and absolutely fell in love with it. to this day, this remains the all out best intergration of hiphop and jazz. some of everything gets sampled and mixed (jeru to duke ellington) to create an album that continues to remain fresh. beware of some of his other offerings, but this album here is that lick!

...this is an excellent r&amp;b album (as far as r&amp;b goes); ms. wright has a very good voice and the production is pretty tight omost on some neo-soul-type vibe. the only problem i have with this is that the majority of her songs revolve around 'situations' - how she reacts to the people who come in and out of her life/relationships...but no emotional depth; she sings soulfully, but not from it and that's the type of stuff i usually fall over...if yall like shae jones' stuff or maybe blu cantrell, then yall gonna love this!!...
