Having given up in defeat after attempting to wander through other alleged &quot;histories of modern Wicca&quot; that turned out to be nothing more than the author's pet fantasies, I asked a well-known Wiccan author and teacher what would be her recommendation. She recommended this book. She wasn't wrong.This book is every bit as good as the positive reviewers say it is, so I won't comment in that area. What I fail to understand is the vehemence of this book's critics, especially those who seem fixated on defending their favorite authors. Hutton is not terribly kind to some authors, yes. But the negative reactions seem to indicate that some people take the words of those authors as a kind of &quot;gospel.&quot; Is that wise?What I do find fascinating is that even though some of the great sacred cows of Wicca/Paganism are done away with, other, even more surprising facts raise their heads. Why is it, for example that even in the most repressive of times, the Goddess will not be effaced? If She will not be worshiped in the churches, then She appears to the poets of the Romantic era. A country cleric, for no good reason, becomes infatuated with Pan and erects a statue to Him in front of a church, simply based on a mis-hearing of the shouting of a group of villagers. There are many such oddities scattered throughout the book. Doesn't it strike anyone else as very odd that the Old Gods and Goddesses keep manifesting themselves, in multitudes of ways, no matter what?The histories of the &quot;major occultists,&quot; are interesting, but behind Hutton's exploration of the lives of people like Graves, Gardner, Crowley, Dion Fortune, Mathers, et. al., there is a subtle running stream of continuity. The Old Gods manifest throughout Hutton's history; not in the traditional common ways that many Wiccans and Pagans were taught, but in even more mysterious glimpses, working through historical figures who have otherwise been forgotten, dropping hints and ideas in old books that somehow magically are picked up by the right person at the right time and read...Perhaps in this book some of our Wiccan and Pagan idols are knocked off their pedestals. Some survive the fall and some do not. But if you look behind all this remarkable scholarship and read the facts that Hutton has put here, you find an astonishing record of how the Old Gods, working behind the scenes, continue to manifest themselves by any means necessary.Is this too religious a view of this book? Probably. I'm sure Hutton's intent was never to show such things. But he has, will he or nil he. It's there to be seen.

A very unsatisfying sequel to the wonderful &quot;Heroic Trio.&quot; The movie is dark and quite frankly very depressing. Three of the most likable major characters die horribly. Defeat and darkness seem to be the major themes here. There are also other problems; the villain is unbelievably silly, even by HK action movie standards. Master Kim, the villain, spends much of his time in the movie talking to a severed head. Michelle Yeoh is barely in the movie, and much of Anita Mui's screentime is limited to domestic scenes with her husband, who apparently has forbidden her to be Wonder Woman now that she has a child. Maggie Cheung has to carry a lot of the plot (such as it is) as a result, and she's definitely not up to the task in this movie. Instead of appearing scrappy and self-reliant, as in Heroic Trio, her character in &quot;Executioners&quot; comes off as shrill, mean-spirited, and not very bright.But I don't know if anyone could have worked with this ruin of a plot. Even by HK action standards, the plot is lacking. Several of the most interesting plot threads that began in Heroic Trio (the fact that Wonder Woman and Invisible Girl are sisters, for example) are dropped completely or handled poorly in this movie. The characters are denied the depth and humanity they could have had. The actresses (for the most part) do the best they can with the script (except for Cheung, who really is not very likable here), but the overall pessimism and ugliness eventually overwhelms them - and everyone else in the movie.Overall, this sequel is very disappointing. I can wholeheartedly recommend &quot;Heroic Trio,&quot; but not this movie. Fans of the first film would be well advised to give this one a pass. There's really nothing to recommend this depressing, sludgy mess.

Ayers' first album, "Joy of a Toy," was more or less a solo effort, but "Shooting" was recorded with his band of the time, The Whole World, and the input of the other members of the band diversifies but doesn't dilute the Kevin Ayers sound. It would be tempting to say that this is what Soft Machine might have sounded like if Ayers hadn't left the group. Ayers' songs are given subtle and tricky arrangements, and alternate with almost Sun Ra-like instrumental freakouts (notably "P*sser Dans Un Violon," which goes on too long, and "Underwater," which doesn't). A very young Mike Oldfield adds guitar and bass playing here, notably the fabulously freaked-out guitar solo in "Lunatics Lament." Lol Coxhill adds suitably demented and interesting (but never overbearing) electric sax and woodwind work.Ayers' songs, as usual, seem almost casual on the surface but on closer inspection reveal an intelligence and direction that bring him fairly close to his contemporary and friend, Syd Barrett. Ayers' dark, luminous baritone voice is his own, however, and his worldview, although sometimes a bit demented, is not burdened with the overtones of paranoia and fear that edge Barrett's work. Ayers' pastoral and carefree view of life informs everything he writes, but don't be decieved by the surface. There's a lot going on underneath, and repeated listenings will reveal more.The extra tracks are terrific. One could argue that "Hat" might go on too long but it gets irrevocably stuck in your head, as do many of the songs here. The remastering is quite good.Kevin Ayers is something of a forgotten jewel in the British crown of eccentric rock, but he has been a hidden influence on many, including Robyn Hitchcock and Julian Cope. The reissues of Ayers' first four albums (arguably his best) are more than welcome, and anyone interested in a very different yet accessible musical view of the world will want this CD.

Imagine, if you will, that Jefferson Airplane and King Crimson had met and decided to form one group. That'll give you an idea of what this Dutch rock group of the 70s was like, but you need to experience Earth & Fire first-hand. They really deserve attention on this side of the world.Earth and Fire, led by the charismatic and beautiful Jerney Kaagman, were quite a success in the Netherlands in the 1970s. They began their career as a psychedelic group with progressive-rock leanings on this album, and scored big in the charts with their singles "Seasons," "Ruby Is The One," and "Wild And Exciting," all of which are on here. This was their first album, from 1971. Their melodic brand of psychedelic rock shows signs of developing further, and it did.From this album forward they became ever more exploratory, putting out the outstanding prog albums "Atlantis" and "Song of the Marching Children." Songs from both those albums are featured here as bonus tracks, and all are worth listening to for fans of strong female vocals and psych/prog rock.Unfortunately, Earth & Fire collectively lost their minds in the mid 1970s, becoming a smarmy sub-Abba disco act. The last two songs on the CD, sadly enough, date from this era of the band, but if you stop the CD right after "Song of the Marching Children," no harm done. The inclusion of these harrowingly awful songs is the only thing that keeps this CD from being a 5-star outing.On this, their first album, they come out dazzlingly fully formed. Granted, their grasp of English was none too sturdy, but Jerney Kaagman's soaring alto overcomes the language barrier, and the band (anchored by brothers Chris and Gerard Koerts on guitar and keyboards) is as good or better than most of their European and British counterparts. Mellotron orchestras, grand Hammond organ flourishes, and powerful guitar riffing abound.If you're a sucker for psychedelic/progressive, this will definitely do it for you. I've owned this CD for about three years now and it's never too far from my player. It's nice to see it's available. If you're a fan of Jefferson Airplane, the Moody Blues, King Crimson, or psychedelic and progressive rock music in general, you will find a lot to like here. Recommended.

Thoughtful and vigorous solo piano recording from a very underrated performer/composer. After a few rotations you begin to note that Weston nods in the direction of Duke Ellington and Thelonius Monk, but it's not a bow of worship, just a tip of the hat before he takes off into his own territory. Weston concentrates on composition and performance, and both are excellent. His mastery of the highest registers of the piano, especially on &quot;Tangier Bay,&quot; is excellent. He can also pound out dense tone clusters or finesse sparse chords with clarity. The man has precision AND soul, which you very seldom find in one person. His compositions here are fat with melodic ideas, and even when he chooses to be ornate, he's never ostentatious. His improvisations are witty, graceful and involved, but never self-involved to the point of excluding the listener. Definitely one of the finer solo jazz piano CD's I've heard. I have no idea why this man is not more well known than he is. The CD does contain one short track, &quot;Kasbah Kids,&quot; which is a bit irritating, but it's supposed to sound like kids playing, and kids irritate me, so maybe it's successful on that level! In addition to this, the final track, &quot;Sahel&quot; with its spoken word interludes between the piano explorations, may sound a little bit dated to some people, though it doesn't sound that way to me. Do not let these minor criticisms stop you from enjoying this very fine record by a musician who definitely deserves to be more well known.

At this point in his career, I have no idea why Miles Davis was playing at all, except perhaps to make money. There's not a single composition on here that's worth hearing; hell, there's hardly anything on here that you'll remember five minutes after the CD is done. Sterile and brainless, this is perfectly representative of the albums he made up until his death. Miles, to be honest, is just going through the motions here. He didn't care about this album, and neither should you.Particular bile goes to the production, which is perfectly harsh and antiseptic, very 80s and very annoying.Overall, this is something no one should inflict on themselves, especially a Miles Davis fan. He had lost it completely by this point.

Until I got the CD release the last time I'd heard this was as an import album in the 1980's. I was shocked at how much of this album I remembered, and I was also surprised at how good it was. I went through a serious T. Rex phase in the 1980s and I feared that maybe my good opinion of it at the time was all nostalgia. Nope! The songs are very glam, very new-wave, and quite of their era, but Marc's unerring sense of style and his way with a hook keeps them from sounding dated.The last release before his death, "Dandy in the Underworld" found Marc coming back strong after frankly subpar albums like "Zip Gun," "Zinc Alloy" and "Futuristic Dragon." His love of 1950's rock is never more evident than here musically, and he was still relying too much on the standard "boogies" that had served him well since Electric Warrior days.But here he reined in most of his more excessive tendencies, kept the songs short, sweet and catchy, wrote some classically Bolanesque dumb-but-smart lyrics, and updated the production, creating the "New Wave" a few years in advance. (Compare this with the first couple of Cars albums and tell me there's not a similarity.) As a result this stands up well alongside "Slider" and "Electric Warrior" - not the exact same, but worth hearing on its own merits.Marc Bolan was a true rock star, and this is, no doubt about it, a late 70's rock star's album. The difference is that this is a good one. It reminds you of why there were rock stars in the first place, it reminds you of why they were cool, and it reminds you - as if anybody needed the reminder! - that Marc Bolan was cool, in any era.

This is a fantastic CD for the student of reggae. Augustus Pablo creates low-key but intense reggae instrumentals. He combines the tough street sound of early reggae with his own mystically-oriented jams and the weird sonorities of the melodica to create something that is distinctly his. Not many people in any field of music can say that.The recording does suffer from the circumstances in which it was recorded. They didn't have the best recording equipment, and occasionally Pablo's melodica is a hair out of tune. There is also something of a sameness to this CD, with too many songs in the same key following one after another. It could have benefited from more careful remastering and perhaps a resequencing of the songs.But this shouldn't stop you from buying the CD. Pablo's music still has the power to lure you into listening to it over and over again, because as sparse as the music seems sometimes, there are actually many subtle things going on here that deserve a careful listening. And the arrangements and performances are top-notch in spite of the slightly dodgy recordings, with the best reggae musicians of the era featured to great effect.Overall, I would recommend this for both serious students of reggae and for those who want to mellow out with something that's musically respectable yet easy on the ear.

In essence this is a sixty-seven minute and 43 second-long pagan religious ceremony, held on an alien planet, performed by metahumans who may or may not have been descended from earthlings. At least that's what it sounds like.You could get picky and specific, and say, yes, they've been listening to Amon Duul II, Can, and early Ash Ra Tempel, but there's a fearlessness to this that makes the Boredoms more spiritual contemporaries of these bands than mere imitators. The Boredoms are no longer interested in breaking things or rattling walls; they've already done that. The Boredoms want Heaven and they want it Now, and if they cannot enter it they will create it by sheer will.It's hard to describe this kind of music. &quot;Vision Creation Newsun&quot; is an Experience in a high sense. It is Magick. There is focus and intent, and that intent is pure transcendence. The best way to experience &quot;Vision Creation Newsun&quot; is to sit down in front of your stereo and commit yourself to it completely, just throw yourself into the dazzling, dizzying alternate universe of sound that they present. You will soon understand why there are no titles. The music does not need titles. It just *is*. That is all you need to know.

This remaster of the first Amon Duul II outing is well worth re-buying. I already had the previous CD reissue, but this version is eye-opening. The aural muddiness and sometimes excessive reverb on the first reissue have been stripped away and the volume has been brought up. It's like looking at a painting that's been restored.Perhaps the best thing I can say is that I found new things that I hadn't heard before, and I've listened to this album many, many times. There were times I found myself saying, "Wait, was this on my other CD?"It's not often that you can take something that was cool to begin with and make it even cooler. My previous review of this CD still stands, but with this remastering I'm even more enthusiastic about it. This is an essential document for anybody who loves psychedelic music. If only more of the great German psych bands' albums were remastered this well! A big "danke" to Amon Duul II for their remastering and reissue of this terrific music.

This is Amon Duul II's first album, and it's everything that the American psych/freakout bands promised but could not deliver. These guys are so lysergic that they make the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane, their american contemporaries at the time (1969) sound like coffee drinking office secretaries by comparison. Furiously surging, ebbing and flowing, the music combines elements of garage rock, avant-garde, psychedelia, and just plain all-out weirdness. The end effect is like being submerged in the ocean of an alien planet. All the lyrics are in German but it doesn't matter; what matters is that you will be swept away. This band should be ranked far above most of their American psych contemporaries. Truly psychedelic music, not for the faint of heart, but spiral into the Duulian atmosphere and you may never return.

I don't have a problem with rough-sounding blues. If they're authentic. But the formula of all these Fat Possum releases brings up some uncomfortable questions.Most Fat Possum releases follow this formula. Find an old drunk guy in Mississippi who can play guitar. Record a gang of raw, under-rehearsed songs in one afternoon, and stick on an extended sampled dance remix with hip-hop/Beck-style moves to hook the kids in. That's pretty much the Fat Possum formula, for which they get a lot more praise than they deserve.What we're supposed to believe, of course, is that the rawer it is, the more authentic it is. But the truth is that T-Model Ford, at least on this record, ain't much by anybody's standards. Most of these songs are blues standards, badly played, and barely reworked to avoid copyright issues. The few originals are half-completed at best, and &quot;If I Had Wings&quot; should never have been recorded. And I think we could all have done without the sound of T-Model blowing his nose.This record is pretty tawdry and lame. I can dig Andre Williams, Howlin' Wolf, early John Lee Hooker, Blind Willie Johnson; I'm no stranger to rough, raw blues. But there's something innately phony about this record that scrapes my nerves raw.&quot;You Better Keep Still&quot; is as calculated as a Britney Spears record, and there's more than a faint whiff of exploitation about the whole thing. It isn't helped by the disco remix by the supposedly hip alterna-dude remix artists. It also isn't helped by the fact that T-Model is really not very good, even by the admittedly relaxed musical standards of country blues.I'm not a blues purist by any means, but this record, like a lot of Fat Possum recordings, smells like a cynical, postmodern, exploitative white boy's vision of the blues. It's almost as if someone who hated the blues decided to form a band that would finally kill off the blues, and chose an ancient, senile drunk to front the band in order to divert any criticism and to fool rock critics into thinking this was somehow &quot;the real thing.&quot;And that, quite honestly, is what I think is happening here. This is an anti-blues record. It's the sound of a sick old man being exploited and a rich white boy laughing his way to the bank. I have no time and no use for this piece of garbage, and neither should you.

Stiff, uninspired &quot;jazz rock fusion&quot; at its worst. This doesn't even bear comparison with the band heard on the first three Soft Machine albums, largely because it isn't the same band. The only member left is keyboardist Mike Ratledge, and he lets newcomer Karl Jenkins create most of the alleged &quot;music&quot; on here. The playing is efficient, predictable, spiritless and dull, and the compositions are purely mundane exercises in jazz rock. On top of this, the production is dry and ugly, making it perfectly clear that this version of the Softs had nothing to say and were saying it in the most unpleasant manner possible. If any record ever deserved the phrase, &quot;A Must To Avoid,&quot; this one certainly does.

Wayne Coyne's self-deprecating liner notes on the inner sleeve are pretty much proven true by the music on this disc. Much of it sounds like the Replacements if the Replacements had taken too much acid instead of drinking too much beer. That being said, there are some good songs on it, like &quot;One Million Billionth Of A Millisecond...&quot; and &quot;God Walks Among Us Now,&quot; but largely this is the sound of a band in search of a clear identity. It's not comparable to the band's classic CDs like &quot;Clouds Taste Metallic,&quot; &quot;Hit to Death...&quot; or &quot;Soft Bulletin,&quot; but it is an interesting glance backwards. The song choice on here is remarkably poor, as well, but Coyne says in the liner notes that some of what he considers the &quot;best&quot; of the early Flaming Lips songs aren't included here. We could all have done without the ultra-lame cover of Led Zep's &quot;Thank You&quot; and the completely aimless &quot;Michael Time To Wake Up&quot; and &quot;Hell's Angels Cracker Factory.&quot; In short, this shouldn't be anyone's first exposure to the Lips, but it's OK for fans who want to complete their collection. Not great...just OK.

The first Hawkwind album (released in 1970) was basically a Dave Brock album with assistance from his friends. However, Nik Turner on sax, Terry Ollis on drums and DikMik on sound generating devices would make it to the next record, &quot;In Search of Space,&quot; as official members.The back of the original release states, &quot;This is the beginning. By now we will be past this album. We started out trying to freak people (trippers), now we are trying to levitate their minds, in a nice way.&quot; That tells you a lot about the music on here. Although it lacks the sonic and rhythmic heaviness (known as &quot;blanga&quot; among Hawkfans) of later releases, it makes up for it with sheer psychedelic freakery and trippy sounds galore. DikMik's contributions are especially interesting when one considers that he was not using a keyboard synthesizer, but rather a set of industrial sound generating devices that he modified to make these unusual sounds.The music is jamming hippie freakery and shows hints of Hawkwind to be. &quot;The Reason Is/Be Yourself&quot; in particular sounds very Hawklike in its middle section. Tribal pounding on the bass and drums commences, and Huw Lloyd-Langton's Hendrix/Clapton influenced guitar flies overhead while DikMik makes growling, burbling and swooshing noises from his tablefull of electronics and Nik Turner wails and honks on sax. The rest of the album consists of similar mysterious and sometimes downright peculiar sonic workouts. The exceptions are the first song, &quot;Hurry On Sundown,&quot; which is a bluesy folk number, and the closer, &quot;Mirror of Illusion.&quot; This last song combines the LSD-swirl of the previous tracks with Brock's folky tendencies to make something that sounds a lot like what Hawkwind will become on their next album.All of it sounds like the work of a band that's developing a sound, but it's fascinating to hear in its embryonic state. As it stands this is a great piece of psychedelic rock music. There are many Hawkwind fans that don't care for this one because it doesn't &quot;rock out&quot; as hard as they're accustomed to, but they're wrong. This is a good album and an auspicious beginning to what would become a 30-plus year career.

What can you say? There's no great art here. There's Teresa Graves, a long, tall good-lookin' woman, catch phrases (&quot;You're under arrest, sugah!&quot;) and lots of afros, bellbottoms, and butt-kicking as Christy Love cleans out a nest of drug dealers - her way. There's nothing innovative here, and definitely no great acting, but this was only an ABC TV-movie meant to introduce the short-lived TV series. Now, of course, it looks like tacky 70s kitsch, and that's exactly what it is. Great fun but don't pay a lot for it, and don't expect too terribly much.

With a voice as smooth and inoffensive as white bread soaked in skim milk and a piano style that rarely strays outside the cocktail lounge, Diana Krall has herself locked into a formidable market niche. But you can't really mistake this for jazz.She can continue to make albums like this as long as her voice holds out, and with as little effort as she expends on singing, that should be about for the next 40 years or so. She sings everything in the same formless, murky alto, creating the comforting sameness that executives need after a hard day at work firing people and cutting budgets so they can afford their salaries.This is a cruel and evil recording, slick, faceless, manipulative to the Nth degree, perfectly tailored &quot;jazz&quot; for people who know nothing about, and in truth probably would hate, real jazz.I have heard far too many people compare Ms. Krall with other great artists, but the one person she most deserves comparison with is Perry Como. But even that facelessly bland crooner pales in comparison with Ms. Krall's emptiness. She is almost Zen in her absence of personality or style, but Zen is never quite as terrifying. There's something of the android about her that chills the soul.As a marketing gimmick, as smooth muzak for the &quot;adult pop&quot; market, this succeeds, but you have to wonder how evil people have to be to create something like this and pass it off as &quot;jazz.&quot;

One of the few five-stars in my book. This was the second Waits album I bought and it has remained with me lo these many years later.Waits' songwriting has already been rightfully praised by other reviewers. What I want to talk about is the music and arrangements that create the atmosphere that sustains this album. The accordion on &quot;Blow Wind Blow&quot; that sounds like it was lifted straight from a 1930's era Popeye cartoon. The clanking, squawking, grinding guitars and the eerie wobble of the Optigan, a toy organ that Waits uses in ways its makers never intended. (The rooster on &quot;I'll Be Gone&quot; is actually from the Optigan.)There's more I could mention. The Albert Ayleresque intro to &quot;Temptation.&quot; The dark, spare resonance of &quot;Yesterday is Here&quot; which sounds like it's being played by a bum with a broken guitar at a deserted railroad crossing. &quot;Please Wake Me Up,&quot; (a plea not to be awakened during a dream) drowned in waves of wobbling pump organ with Waits' vocal sounding as if it was recorded over the phone. The frightful apotheosis of &quot;Straight To The Top (Vegas)&quot; and &quot;I'll Take New York,&quot; which sounds like the soundtrack to the crucifixion of a bad lounge singer.Nothing is normal here, which fits in with the theme of dreams. And underlying everything is the same kind of sorrow that motivates the best American music; the blues, in short. It's about wandering, whether in your mind or in reality or both.If you have to be lost, it might as well be with Tom Waits, who can tell a shaggy dog story better than anyone.Tom Waits is an oddity, complete unto himself, and probably one of the greatest artists America has ever produced, although most Americans don't realize it. This is one of his best and most completely realized pieces of art.

This is probably the best of the Hawkwind compilations. It contains a decent overview of the band's work, and it's a pretty good selection, although I wonder why they only put the single version of &quot;Psychedelic Warlords&quot; on instead of the longer version. I am glad they included &quot;Hurry On Sundown,&quot; and &quot;Urban Guerilla,&quot; which are (to my ears) two great Hawkwind cuts. This is really a good intro to the band for someone just discovering them; it covers most of their early stuff and dodges the occasionally iffy later work entirely. The only complaint I have is that the live version of &quot;You Shouldn't Do That&quot; is not the best quality it could be, but with a lot of the early Hawkwind albums going missing these days (or only being available as pricey imports) this will do. Overall this is not an essential release for the fan, but as a best-of, it's just fine. And even a dedicated Hawkwind fan who has all the material on the original albums might find this useful to turn their friends on to them - or just to play really loud on your car's CD player.

A transitional album for the Dead, in between the wilder psychedelic years and the return to roots music that followed. Strong songwriting and playing and good production make this one of the Dead's more successful studio albums. However, as usual, the live versions of all of these songs should be heard as well. Much of the Dead's studio work serves as a template for what the songs turned into live. That said, this is a fine album, with the exception of "What's Become of the Baby," which quite honestly could have been left off the album entirely and few would have cared.This CD features the 1972 "remix" of the album, as every Deadhead knows. The reason for this is because no one could find the original mix of Aoxomoxoa, according to interviews with Dead archivist David LeMieux. Rhino, in conjunction with the Dead, decided that it would be better to release a strong version of the 1972 mix. The alternative would have been to release a straight album-to-CD digital transfer with inferior sound.The included extra material, to my mind, more than makes up for the lack of the original mix. The studio jams and outtakes add a lot to this album and show that the Dead were powerful musicians, something that often gets overlooked outside the circle of Deadheads. Overall, this remaster is worth having, especially for those who aren't Deadheads per se but want to get a grip on what the Dead were all about.

Overall a very crude and amateurish deck. If you are interested in hermetic Tarot, the Crowley-Harris deck is truly all you need. This deck, with its clumsy, off-kilter, amateurish art and complete lack of color (and yes, that is important when working with a Tarot deck) is not worth bothering with. There are any number of better Tarots that address hermetic material and concepts. I fail to see why this badly drawn, poorly drafted, confusing deck would attract anyone. The Crowley-Harris deck and the Cicero and Wang decks are still available, and are far superior to this colorless, crude mess.

Rand doesn't have characters; she writes archetypes of the gods of her own personal Objectivist universe, and sets up stilted, histrionic situations where they bounce off one another clumsily like bumper cars at a second-rate carnival.There aren't any likable characters in this book, and no one comes even close to displaying anything like humanity. The plot, hackneyed as it is, groans under the weight of pseudophilosophical pretention that Rand heaps on it.In a way this book is very much like the newly-revived religious classic, &quot;What Would Jesus Do,&quot; in that both books are not meant to entertain the reader, but rather browbeat the reader into accepting the religious tenets of the author. In &quot;WWJD&quot; it is born-again Christianity; in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; it is Rand's &quot;Objectivism.&quot;In both cases, the burdensome theology heaped on the reader's head makes both these books absolutely unbearable. I forced myself to finish this book - twice - because I had friends who sincerely thought there was something to Rand's philosophies, and something good about this book. There isn't.I beg you, dear reader, spare yourself this mutant monstrosity of a &quot;book.&quot; Twenty minutes after starting to read this, if you are any kind of normal person at all, you will experience an overwhelming urge to pitch it across the room and go find something better to do, like clipping your toenails or calling your mom.Follow those urges.

Astoundingly overrated, Stevens is a weak singer-songwriter who sounds here like a pastiche of James Taylor and Brian Wilson at their very worst. Lyrical conceits fall flat, and the overtones of born-again-ness are teeth-grating. The tunes are lackadaisical, half-composed at best. Nothing here has any energy, and I can't detect any real emotion or commitment here.I am at a loss to explain why this collection of mediocre-to-bad songs, performed and sung with a half-a$$ed attitude and no energy, has gotten so many good reviews from so many people. There is absolutely nothing here. Buying this is like buying a blank CD.

Pitt, never what you would really call an actor, turns in a performance here that is nothing short of amazing, if you rule out the fact that no police department in the country would hire someone with Tourette's who appears to neither shave nor bathe very often.The storyline has all the depth and literacy of the last fourteen slasher movies you saw, which is appropriate because this is basically a fancy slasher movie.Morgan Freeman basically provides the only element of sanity in this movie. He often looks at Pitt in disbelief as though he were thinking, &quot;They pay you to do this?&quot;Putrid, disgusting, formless, meaningless, and needlessly excessive, this is an example of modern Hollywood at its worst. Avoid at all costs.

Terrific remaster by Tony Visconti of this classic album. I have no idea what the negative reviewers are talking about; there is no "drop out" on Mambo Sun. The cover art was never much to begin with, even on the original album - and I have an original US copy of the album, thanks. The poster shot of Bolan from the album is not here, and yes, the lack of lyrics is slightly disappointing. However, you get priceless notes on the recording of the album from Tony Visconti. There are also extra photos of Marc and the band, and the illustrations from the album's inner paper sleeve (hey, we didn't get that in America!!). To me this makes up for the lack of lyrics. I know them all by heart anyway.Enough of that; what you should be worried about is the sound. The sound is absolutely terrific. I compared this with my Japanese CD and the difference was night and day. It was as if a layer of fog had been lifted from the music; everything is sharp and clear. I was surprised at how much of Bill Legend's drum parts and Steve Currie's bass I had been missing out on all these years! And the peculiar details of Marc's guitar playing really come into focus. (Make sure you check the liner notes for Visconti's comments on Bolan's musical quirks.)Of course the album itself is a classic. How can you argue with a CD that has both "Get it On" and "Jeepster," both brilliant 70's rock songs? Not to mention Bolan's mystical eldritch side, encapsulated in "Cosmic Dancer," and "Monolith." And the wistful "Life's A Gas," the charmingly inept "Lean Woman Blues," and "Rip Off," which is still pretty strange today; all this adds up to a great album, then and now. Bolan both invented and transcended "glam rock" on Electric Warrior.The bonus tracks sound equally good, but are mostly useful for T. Rex fans like me, who want to hear what the songs were like when Bolan was working out the details in the studio with the band. It sounds like recording this album was a lot of fun. Bolan laughs and kids around a lot, and as a result the bonus tracks convey his innate charm and enthusiasm. The outtakes also show us interesting stripped-down alternate versions of familiar songs, some with alternate lyrics.Overall, this 30th Anniversary reissue is highly recommended. Bolan's albums have not always gotten the best treatment in the past when they were reissued on CD, but Visconti's remix is a must-have, and worthy of Marc Bolan's legacy.

This was my first exposure to Neruda's poetry and it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. It seemed nonsensical and adolescent, like a teenager who thinks he's smarter than he actually is, writing poetry to impress his 9th grade English teacher. I was ready to conclude that Neruda was not worth wasting my time on until I got on here and discovered all the other one-star reviews berating the quality of the translation. For now I will reserve judgment on Neruda until I read a decent translation. This is a dreadful book.

From the Bo Diddley-influenced &quot;Voice Poetry&quot; to &quot;European Echoes,&quot; this is some brain-frizzling stuff. Even though Ornette uses electric guitar and electric bass here, this can't really be compared to the other &quot;jazz fusion&quot; that came out in the 70s. This is more personal and very individualistic. Where most fusion bands were trying to sound like John Coltrane gone electric, Prime Time and Ornette drew on basic rock/r&amp;b forms here, and then bend them beyond recognition. If you're a big fan of acoustic jazz, chances are you won't like much here. However, if you have an open ear and are familiar with bands like Captain Beefheart and Pere Ubu, you will immediately click with this. Ornette sounds great here and it's fascinating to hear him playing over, under and around the electric guitars, bass and drums. On the liner notes Ornette says the music is &quot;...not jazz, classical, rock, or blues...it is pure Harmolodic where all forms can exist in the now...&quot; This is exactly true. The music on here is unclassifiable and if you pay attention to it, it unfolds before you in strange beauty. One of Ornette's best, I think.

"Texas Flood" was a sensation when it came out for several reasons. One is that the music scene at the time was drowned in droolingly stupid synth-pop, and Vaughan was the absolute antithesis of that. Second, he was discovered and endorsed by John Hammond, who discovered a number of great blues and jazz artists. This gave SRV the stamp of approval from the "old guard," something that a lot of people who were doing the same thing that SRV was lacked. Third, he was in the public eye as the guitarist on Bowie's then-popular "Let's Dance" album. Finally, he really was a pretty hot guitarist.However, Stevie Ray Vaughan never - EVER - transcended his influences, and the current high esteem in which he is held nowadays is more reflective of his tragic death and his high public profile than his actual playing ability. There were, and are, several other guitarists who were playing the blues at the time this album was recorded who were as good or better than SRV. Stevie Ray happened to have the good luck to catch the public eye at the right time.That being said, this album is probably his least excessive and most enjoyable album. He wears his influences on his sleeve, and there's nothing here you haven't heard before from Buddy Guy, Albert King, Jimi Hendrix, Freddy King, or a number of other guitarists we could all mention. The difference is that he played as honestly as he knew how with less fuss than on later albums."Texas Flood," is a good, but by no means great, white blues-rock album. It's not the greatest blues guitar album ever made by any means, and SRV was not the best blues guitarist in Texas, but it is a good album.Stevie Ray Vaughan's greatest contribution to the blues was his humility. When he did have the public eye, he was careful to give credit to his influences and point out his favorite players. This educated people (and guitar players) who were unaware of the history of the blues and its players. In some cases (Buddy Guy in particular) it brought their careers back from the dead and reintroduced them to a whole new, appreciative audience. He also opened the door for other modern blues guitarists.SRV also reasserted the value of American roots music in a time when the music scene was overwhelmed by some of the most miserable music ever recorded. He used his pop stardom to communicate his love for the blues, and that is no small achievement. The hundreds of SRV imitators and wanna-bees who followed in his wake are evidence of his ability to communicate that love.The realistic truth is, though, that there were other guitarists out there - Tinsley Ellis, Jimmie Vaughan, and Bugs Henderson for example - who were doing the same thing that SRV was, at the same time, and it was luck that SRV made the bigtime. This album shows how good SRV was, but if you compare it to his peers, it shows that he was only good, not brilliant, and certainly not a genius in any sense of the word.Stevie's gift was to be an entertainer and to wake people up to the beauty of the blues, but to call him a genius or a pioneer is to do him an injustice, and he, I think would be embarrassed by some of the hype that is heaped upon his head. Enjoy this album for what it is - a very solid blues-rock album - and use it as a springboard to explore the blues. But using SRV as your be-all and end-all of blues guitar isn't good, and it's not what he would have wanted.

This is my first exposure to Masekela's music, and it was a huge letdown.&quot;The Lasting Impressions of Ooga Booga,&quot; sounds very pop and very loungey. Perhaps at the time it sounded much more progressive than it does now, but that doesn't evade the fact that nowadays it sounds fairly tired.And it's absolutely painful to hear Masekela obviously missing notes on the trumpet and playing, well, not to be too blunt, very poorly indeed. His tone is blaring and his pitch is none too sure. And in spite of the alleged &quot;African&quot; nature of the record, I hear a ton of western influences, not least John Coltrane and Miles Davis compositionally.Overall, I was somewhat less than impressed with this, and I can't recommend it. Perhaps Masekela's other records are better, but based on this one I would have to say you'd have to prove it to me first before I plunked down any more money.

This is Roxy Music's most overtly "rock" album. Part of the reason for this is that the group was writing less complex material. Whether this was as a reaction to their prior art-rock leanings, an attempt to become more commercial, or because Bryan Ferry was hearkening back to his soul and pop roots is immaterial; it's probably a little of all the above.Another factor in this was that the band, at this point, had a very strong power trio at its core. Guitarist Phil Manzanera and drummer Paul Thompson (who is not called "The Great Paul Thompson" by fans for nothing!) were joined by studio bassist John Gustafson. His heavy, muscular bass playing seems to drive Manzanera and Thompson to new heights, especially on "The Thrill of it All," "All I Want is You," "Casanova" and "Bittersweet."Musically the album is a fairly varied affair, ranging from hard rock to swirling psychedelia ("Out of the Blue" with Eddie Jobson's flanged violin/keyboards, is classic) to more-or-less straight blues and almost-country stylings. All of it works, even the odd "Triptych," which seems to be Ferry's attempt at writing a hymn.One of the more interesting things about this record is that it is one of the most ripped-off of all Roxy Music albums. For example, Duran Duran built their entire career around rewriting "The Thrill of it All." And the creepy "Bittersweet," with its deliberately maudlin Brecht/Weill opening and the jarring 1930s-Berlin-on-acid section, was stolen lock, stock and barrel by Roger Waters (and bloated beyond endurance) to create the last quarter of the Pink Floyd's "pity-me" epic, "The Wall." As in most cases, the original leaves the imitators looking pale. And whether he means to or not, Ferry out-Elton Johns Elton John with "A Really Good Time," which probably should have been a hit in America. Not to mention "All I Want is You," which is one of the great lost power-pop gems from a band that nobody would suspect of power-pop.All in all this is a grand record. It's stylish, smart, sharp, and yet has a heart. In an era where rock was often bloated, dunderheaded blues jams played by shaggy guys who hadn't bathed in a while and wore dirty jeans onstage in an attempt to appear "authentic," this record (like all Roxy's records) stood out. And to this day it doesn't sound dated at all. A great accomplishment and still one of the best Roxy Music albums.

With the current trend for &quot;sacred steel,&quot; it's interesting to hear steel guitar from the &quot;other side of the tracks.&quot; Hop Wilson apparently didn't like touring, and spent most of his musical career playing in Houston, Texas. The recordings featured here are pretty much his entire output.But what an output it is. Hop's lap steel guitar playing is by turns wildly demented and plangently sweet, sometimes within the same phrase. The lap steel adds a different tonal color to the proceedings, and Wilson has a terrific singing voice, perfect for blues, with a mournful edge even on the faster numbers. Drummer Ivory Lee Semien and an unknown vocalist take the mike on two other numbers, but I prefer Wilson's own singing, though they do a fine job.The &quot;recorded in a bar at midnight&quot; ambience, combined with the occasional amp crackle and buzz, gives you that feeling of presence lost on many modern sanitized blues recordings. The band is loose but tight, and you get the feeling they are into what they're playing and know the material well.Professional blues critics have compared Hop Wilson to Elmore James, but I frankly don't hear it except on &quot;Be Careful With The Blues,&quot; where Wilson lifts the &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; riff and makes it his own in an instrumental. Wilson is less frenetic than James, and throws a lot more variety into his music. As much as I love Elmore James, a lot of his material relied on that &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; riff and stayed in the same key. Wilson has no such limitations.Overall this is a great, downhome, funky recording of a little-known and underappreciated bluesman. I would recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates the real live blues.

A good half of the songs on this album are in the key of G; sit down with the guitar and figure them out yourself. Why? Because Roger Waters wrote a majority of them, and came up with the lyrics, which are beginning to show the vile pomposity that made &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; impossible to listen to. Waters' second-rate junior college philosophy class existentialism, and his attempts to be up-to-date by pointing fingers at social problems just like the punks of the day, sounds terribly dated now, as does the meandering, aimless and dull songwriting. The best thing about this record is David Gilmour's singing and guitar playing. Other than that, there is very little to recommend it.

The book is quite a rollercoaster ride. It's mostly a showcase for images and ideas, tons of them, thrown at you a mile a minute. The breaks in the narrative, and even the Sumerian mythology dissertations, didn't distract me. I even liked those parts, and felt they gave more substance to the book than it would have otherwise had. Granted the &quot;language is a virus&quot; riff was copped straight from William S. Burroughs, but Stephenson played it well.The characterization and plotting reminded me very much of an anime, something that other reviewers have pointed out accurately. Unfortunately, I don't care for anime very much. Most anime is thinly plotted and poorly characterized, and Stephenson's book suffers from the same problem. To be honest with you, the character I sympathized the most with was the cyber-dog.Stephenson created an interesting world that I liked spending time in, but he didn't seem to know quite what to do with it, and overall &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is overwhelmed by its author's florid imagination. Sadly, Stephenson followed this tendency in his subsequent writing instead of focusing on learning how to write plots and characters. His work since &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is imaginative, but didactic to the point of being incomprehensible, and plots and characters are low on his priority list.&quot;Snow Crash&quot; is by far Stephenson's best work, and because of this it remains the only one that most science fiction readers know him for. Hopefully one day Stephenson can get his imagination under a bit more control, learn more about plot and characterization, and produce more humanistic and less manic work. Until then, this is his best, and it's worth reading.

Dear Guys:There comes a time in the life of every band where going on would be a horrible mockery of everything they once stood for, and REM has reached that point.Being compared to Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb is not a good thing. Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb write schmaltz. Schmaltz is bad. Schmaltz is for chubby yuppies who sit in Barcaloungers and drink cocktails. I don't really care if the postmodernist critics who infest rock publications like leprosy have ordained that Schmaltz Is Good and Pop Must Be Smooth And Creamy. They're wrong. Schmaltz is, and always has been, Evil. It's a drained, enervated, sickly form of pseudomusic.REM is now performing Schmaltz. Hang it up, guys, please, before you get as embarrassing as Pete Townshend and Mick Jagger. REM's time is done. You had a damn good run and made some brilliant albums. But that's all over. Michael, you go on with your solo career; I can see you becoming a sort of cross between Scott Walker and Morrissey, playing the occasional gig with a 90 piece orchestra, lounging on a barstool and making world weary observations while the spotlights shine off your head. Pete, join another ROCK BAND, all right? You're not a jazz guitarist. And you need to learn some new licks. Mr. Mills, perhaps you should become a professional arranger and studio musician.But no matter what you decide to do guys, please don't do anything called REM any more. I have too many good memories of what you used to do, and who you used to be, before you became what you are now - which is not REM. It's no fun any more, and you know it. It's over. Please don't beat a dead horse and embarrass yourselves. Say goodnight to it and let REM rest in peace. Sincerely,A Fan From Day One

Unpleasant, dark (as in, poor lighting!), and needlessly violent, this is not at all the definitive Batman film that many fanboys would like to make it out to be, and in fact is one of the worst screen versions of the Batman since George Clooney donned the cowl.Bale, as Batman, is a failure. As Bruce Wayne he hardly seems authoritative, or, indeed, very interesting. His "Batman voice" just sounds as if he just had some sort of throat operation. Bale has always been a stiff, inexpressive actor, and he is never more so than here. His Batman is so unhuman that it makes you wonder why Gordon trusts him at all; the viewer certainly doesn't. This Batman's outbursts of hyperviolent, uncontrollable rage - a trait completely counter to the original comic book version of Batman - are the final touch in making this Batman, and Bale, very dislikable.The flatness that Bale brings to the screen makes Heath Ledger's Joker that much more of a contrast. Ledger's Joker is not an Oscar-worthy performance. To be blunt, he's chewing the scenery at a level that would have been hilarious if it were not for the fact that he died shortly after making the movie. Ledger's performance is not one for the ages, as too many claim. It is easy - far too easy - to play a psychotic, over-the-top villain. It takes little acting skill. The hype that has surrounded Ledger's performance here has to do with his death, not his skillfulness in the role.In all truth, his performance is no better or worse than Jack Nicholson's in the Tim Burton Batman. Yes, Ledger brings a collection of tics, glares, twitches, and cackles to the part that are somewhat entertaining - but that can't be counted as acting. The hype that Ledger explored his "dark side" for this role is just so much urban legend tripe. He's overacting, in a movie that was written for him to overact in. The Joker gets all the obvious water-cooler-quote/internet-worthy lines. The combination of Ledger's overacting and the obviousness of the script becomes tiresome.Maggie Gyllenhaal seems lost in this mess. She seems the only real human in a movie full of phony, hyperextended male egos. The less said about Aaron Eckhart's completely predictable Harvey Dent/Two-Face, the better. He provides a third, completely unnecessary, hyper-egotistical psycho for the script, and as such serves as a fifth or even a sixth wheel, slowing the script and providing unnecessary complications and false drama.The action scenes are, as usual these days, too loud, too long, too violent, and too hard to see. Everything is always too dark.To sum up, this is an unpleasant movie that panders to its fanboy audience and makes up for its severe shortcomings through bluster, volume, and just plain ugliness. It's unworthy of the Batman legacy. And it is unworthy to be counted among the best superhero movies. In spite of all the hype, The Dark Knight does not hold a candle to the Marvel superhero movies - Spiderman and Iron Man outdo it in almost every way. In spite of the fact that few people will agree with me, I would not be able to recommend this movie to anyone. Overhyped, underacted, and badly written, it's a mess.

And it all begins with an orgasm. Accompanied by space noises. At least that's what it sounds like. Which is highly appropriate for a band that was intent on ecstasy and its spiritual meanings, without being heavy-handed enough to say so.At this point the band consisted of Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth with a cast of characters who would disappear by the time of the second album, except for reedman extraordinaire Didier Malherbe. Recorded in a barn on a movie camera, the sound is rough but not too rough. Don't let that stop you; this is one of the most essential psychedelic records, period.After the orgasm we get Daevid coming in strumming away on an acoustic and telling us that we are the Magick Brothers and Mystick Sisters of the title, which is the basic message throughout. The music matches the message; Allen, Smyth and cohorts flip through folk-jazz, proto-fuzz, tape collages, psych-rock, free jazz and floating whimsy, without once sounding pretentious. There's a loose feeling to the music that shows its improvised origins, but once you listen closer there is a subtle focus and an open sense of fun, just as in all of Daevid Allen's Gong output.Yes, it is whimsical, but underneath the whimsy is a message. The famous Pothead Pixies make a cameo appearance, by the way, in &quot;Gongsong.&quot; At the end it all sort of floats away rather than ending, which is perfectly appropriate for Gong.&quot;Magick Brother&quot; is really a sketchbook for what later Gong would become, but like any good sketchbook it's filled with a lot of fascinating ideas and great images. It's very psychedelic, very &quot;high,&quot; and very loose and free. I find myself returning to this CD over and over again in the years since I originally bought it, and I am rewarded with something new every time. Quite worthwhile for anybody who has an adventurous musical spirit.

Like all the rest of Rand's fiction, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; clonks along like a 1956 Chevy pickup with flat tires on a dirt road. It exhibits as much literary grace as a hippopotamus on waterskis, splashing didactic Objectivism in its wake and nearly drowning laughing observers in waves of pedantry.I first read this book at age 15 and at the time it certainly seemed brave and inspiring. I read it again at age 25 and was far less impressed, and the last time I tried to read it I couldn't finish it. The plotline is painfully simple. The dialogue has no trace of authenticity, or any of the rhythm of normal human speech. The characters are cardboard cutouts with little or no subtlety. The less said about the agonizing length of the book, the better. Nothing happens but talk for enormously long stretches, and then when something does happen, it seems anticlimactic, because the characters have already signaled what is going to happen. And afterwards they analyze each event in excruciating detail, never forgetting to put a nice Randian Objectivist spin on everything.Rand could have taken a lesson from Robert Heinlein. Heinlein was another objectionable, obnoxious person with a semipolitical/philosophical axe to grind, but Heinlein knew that you couldn't talk your reader to death. So he had the good grace to put in the occasional explosion, alien invasion, or sex scene in between his philosophical rants. He also had a sense of humor, which Ayn Rand's books completely and absolutely lack.This is primarily a very dull book. It appeals to misunderstood adolescents because it addresses their concerns: being misunderstood, wanting freedom, wanting to be the big hero who triumphs over all through sheer force of will, etc., etc.But those who have left adolescence behind, who are not as self-absorbed or as self-righteous as Rand and her characters are, will not find much to like in this book. The positive reviewers in the &quot;Synopsis&quot; section above harp on how much Rand's novels have sold, but if large sales guarantee high quality, then V.C. Andrews must be the new Shakespeare.I advise anyone with good sense to give this book a pass. There are thousands of other good books you could read, including the New York City Telephone Directory, before you try to tackle this unreadable, lumpy mess.

I expected much better after reading the high-flown praise here and elsewhere. What we have here is a band that is influenced by Pink Floyd, but unfortunately post-Dark Side Pink Floyd, when Roger Waters' unrelenting pessimism and melody-free &quot;music&quot; destroyed them. Steven Wilson is not really that impressive a guitarist, although he does do a passable Gilmour, and his voice is quite thin. The record is drowned in reverb, and the compositions are ponderous, humorless, overblown and ultimately numbing in their excessiveness. The heavy metal moves the band engages in make them sound more like Queensryche (another band I can't stand). Basically, this is pompous 70s stadium rock masquerading as prog, which it isn't. If you really are dying to hear a recreation of the 70s Floyd sound, Kula Shaker's &quot;Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts&quot; is much closer in spirit and execution, and it's a lot more fun to listen to. Wilson can't really write a workable tune to save his life, and his portentous lyrics are a stone drag. In short, you can live without this one.

If heavily armed aliens came to Earth and said, &quot;Give us a reason why we should not wipe humans off the face of the planet,&quot; I would play them &quot;Angels&quot; from the first disc of this two disc set, and they would leave in shame. It took me a long time to come to a point where I could appreciate Ayler, but this CD, which is among the finest work he ever did, helped a lot. Ayler seemed to believe that every sound that could be made should be a part of music, and this is why he includes &quot;noise&quot; in his playing, along with lightspeed solos, blasts of enormous tonalities, and pure sheets of abstract sound. His melodic statements are simple but played with such force and conviction and such rawness that it demands some sort of reaction from the listener. You will either think you are hearing God's own music or the worst sort of devilish noise; there are no halfway marks with Ayler.This CD set really shows Albert Ayler at his best, combining musical ideas to create the essentially spiritual sound that he heard in his head, a sound that was meant to inspire his listeners to transcendence. This is not easy music to listen to because it violates nearly every rule of not only jazz but music as it is normally played and heard, but it is terribly, terribly important to listen to this music. Why? Because Albert Ayler's music is one of the most pure expressions of the human spirit ever recorded. If you listen to this, I mean really listen, and not try to use it as background music - if you give it your full attention, put aside your preconceptions about what music should or should not be, and open your mind to the sounds on these two CDs, you will be changed. And for the better.

Apparently Michael Stipe has decided he wants to be Natalie Merchant, and so here the band (who sound profoundly disinterested in these weak, watery, limp songs) presents us with an album full of whine. I liked Michael Stipe a lot better when I couldn't understand him. It's long past time for REM to break up, and this record is proof positive. I used to be an REM fan, from &quot;Murmur&quot; onward, but now I can't even listen to their old stuff, because their last 3 albums have been so embarrassingly bad. Give it up, guys, shake hands and call it a day. It's better to quit music altogether than to do stuff like this.

This is essentially a bootleg of BBC shows. Eno made some live appearances with a band called The Winkies in his post-Roxy Music career, before a collapsed lung cut his early live career short.The songs here are mostly from &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets.&quot; In a live setting they lose a little of the atmospheric and eerie qualities they have on those two albums, but they gain a sense of sheer fun and eccentricity that makes up for the loss. Brian Eno rocks? You betcha.The CD is short, and the sound quality is rough in spots. It would be nice to have a &quot;legitimate&quot; version of these shows, but so far it hasn't come to pass. The energy and sheer craziness makes up for the rough sound quality. Overall this is essential for the Eno fan, and a lot of fun for anybody into interesting rock music. The CD is currently listed as &quot;out of print,&quot; but like many of these semi-legitimate releases, it'll probably pop up again. Get it when you have the opportunity.

As you might expect, this sounds a little like a combination between early Soft Machine and early Gong, primarily due to the presence of Daevid Allen, Gong's master loony. Daevid doesn't sing, but he plays some truly odd - and sometimes quite awful - guitar solos, and contributes to the overall attitude of fresh-faced looney whimsy. Robert Wyatt's drumming and vocals are of course utterly brilliant. Kevin Ayers contributes a couple of songs, and there are early versions of songs that would later appear in other forms on Soft Machine albums. Recording quality is adequate and the band seems under-rehearsed, which is forgivable as this was a rushed session set up by the infamous Giorgio Gomelsky to make a demo tape. It was never intended to be released to the public, but of course it was. This isn't just for Softs and Gong completists, but it sure helps if you are one. There are some great psych-pop songs on here, but it is obvious that both Daevid Allen and the Softs' best work was yet to come. Still a worthwhile diversion.

This is yet another reissue of the band's demo recordings, made by Giorgio Gomelsky before the band was signed. At this point, Daevid Allen (of Gong fame) was very much a part of the group. Unfortunately, on this recording he is the band's weak point. He plays with a lot of energy and takes a lot of chances, but it would have been nice if he had tuned his guitar every once in a while.Overall, though, this is a minor quibble. Robert Wyatt's drumming and singing is, as usual, excellent. He sounds young and full of fire, and it's a joy to hear him here. Ayers contributes his bit as well, adding a bent pop sensibility and his inimitable musical viewpoint. Ratledge, for his part, is surprisingly restrained as compared to subsequent releases, but he does quite well.This is a far cry from the jazz fusion the Softs would eventually be known for; it's far closer to demented British pop music, with most of the songs being relatively short, but nonetheless intense and innovative. This record is an absolute must for people who appreciate Wyatt, Ayers, Daevid Allen, or the early Soft Machine, and would be recommended for anyone into the more eclectic and demented side of British rock of the 1960's.

Lou's first Arista album was an unfortunate harbinger of things to come. This was probably the dumbest album Lou Reed ever wrote; the lyrics are abysmal and the music is bland.It's just impossibly stupid. Not stupid in an entertaining way, like Iggy Pop or the Ramones; stupid, as in continuing to wear your polyester leisure suit to public functions and thinking you actually look good in it."Temporary Thing" is the only song on here that's any good; to be honest, it's the only song on here that I remember. Lou's done a lot better than this. In all his time on Arista he would only turn out one certifiably good record, and that was "Street Hassle." This isn't as awful as "The Bells" or "Growing Up In Public," but it's not much better.

More focused and even more trippy than their first album, &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; features the 13th Floor Elevators at their best. The songs are eerie, rambling, and potent, so powerful that they overcome the lo-fi production that plagued the Elevators throughout their career. Roky Erickson's vocals are sometimes eerily reminiscent of Robert Plant. This is a heavily psychedelic album and shows a San Francisco influence; at this point in their career the Elevators had played in SF and shared stages with the Jefferson Airplane, among other 60s psych groups.The difference is that the Elevators mean every word and note. They were really trying to &quot;break on through to the other side,&quot; unlike some psych groups who were just in it for the money. As a result &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; is spookier and edgier than most psychedelia. At times it approaches Syd Barrett territory. Highly recommended.Recording Quality Geek Note: The import version on Charly has better sound than the Collectables reissue, but not by much. This is because the master tapes for all the Elevators' albums remain undiscovered - or their location is undisclosed at this time, nobody's sure which. It's way past time for somebody to go on a search for the master tapes and do a remastered version, because this CD (as well as the other Elevators' albums) deserves it.

This book is a good introduction and explanation of Ceremonial Magick. Everything is laid out precisely and clearly, and by reading it, I became absolutely sure that Ceremonial Magick was NOT the path for me. But I came to understand the mindset and the practices of the ceremonial magickian by reading this very accessible and user friendly book. It contains some very good explanations of practices that every practitioner of magick, whether Ceremonial or not, can use, and is very helpful as a reference even if, like me, you choose not to walk the challenging path of Ceremonial Magick. A worthwhile book.I would like to add to the young lady who wished to use this book to &quot;cast spells&quot; on her ex-boyfriend: there is such a thing as the Law of Three, which states that you will get back three times over whatever energy you send out. I suppose you will learn from experience what magickal backlash is all about. Enjoy the lesson.

The Strawbs started out as a folk group. With this album they began to evolve toward a more &quot;progressive&quot; sound, undoubtedly spurred on by Rick Wakeman, who guested on this album. &quot;Glimpse of Heaven,&quot; which leads this CD off, is a perfect example; it begins as a pastoral folk piece and evolves into a much quicker middle section, with Hammond organ flourishes, then returns to the folky beginning.This first song sets the pace for those to follow. Although the album is not repetitive or dull, there is an overall &quot;feel&quot; to the album that is very representative of its time (early '70s). Lyrical themes tend toward the mystical, and the use of sitars, banjo, dulcimer and tabla, along with Wakeman's creative keyboards, add colors to the music that pull it out of the &quot;folk ghetto&quot; that a lot of similar bands got trapped in.Dave Cousins, the main songwriter here, was never afraid to be earnest or romantic, sometimes to an embarrassing extent, but his occasional missteps are offset by the contributions of John Ford and Richard Hudson, who not only provided perfect accompaniment but contributed songs of their own.Some few of the songs have not dated well, but there are many magical moments on this album, where the vocal harmonies of Cousins, Hudson and Ford mesh with the modernized (and sometimes fairly psychedelic) British folk structures of the songs to create a truly distinctive sound.On a personal note, I have a great deal of affection for this album. It was helpful to me when I was trying to break away from my heavy metal youth, so I do wonder how well this review will relate to people in general. However, I do think that this CD is a lost classic, and anyone who enjoys Clannad, Lorena McKennitt, and other modern progressive folk music will find a lot to like here. I personally love this album for what it is; excellently performed progressive folk, sometimes with hippy overtones, but always sincere and always credible. I am really happy to see this back out on CD, as I have gone through two vinyl copies already. For fans of quiet, intricate, emotional music, the Strawbs &quot;Witchwood&quot; should not be passed by.

Originally released in the US as &quot;Expresso I&quot; with a different cover, this is jazz fusion that has little, if anything, to do with Daevid Allen's version of Gong. The outstanding elements here are Allan Holdsworth's guitar playing and Pierre Moerlen's drumming. The tunes are, well, OK, but somehow I can't get excited about them. I should say here that personally, I am much more a fan of the Daevid Allen era Gong. This is the post-Allen Gong. That may color my view of the album. It's not a bad album in any sense of the word. It is a lot better, as jazz fusion, than a lot of jazz fusion that came out at the time. It's lighter, the musicianship is impeccable without being overbearing and pretentious, and there is a sense of fun that most jazz fusion lacks. But in the end, I have to admit, like most jazz fusion, it leaves me a bit cold. Maybe I would have liked this better if it had been called &quot;The Pierre Moerlen Band.&quot; Then again, maybe not.Recommended for jazz fusion heads. People looking to make another journey to the planet Gong, however, might want to borrow someone else's copy first.

I have lived with this album for a number of years; I bought it when it came out. The thing that bugs the everlasting hoo-hah out of me is the fact that Steve Albini made Polly Jean's vocals nearly inaudible, mixing them far below the rest of the band. I don't know if this was deliberate on Albini's part; I wouldn't put that past him. Any guy that names his band &quot;Rapeman&quot; probably has problems with women. In any case, this would have been a great second album, if you didn't constantly have to jack the volume up and down. You're either straining to hear it or you're turning it down; nothing in between. That's annoying, but I don't blame it on PJ Harvey; I blame that on Steve Albini, the then-producer. It would be nice if someone would remix this entire CD and re-release it. Until then, keep your hand near the volume knob. And it would be a pity if you didn't; this has as many strong songs as &quot;Dry&quot; did. You just have to dig them out from under Albini's poor production skills.

I appreciate this deck because of its Pagan symbolism. I will admit that up front. I also appreciate the artwork, which others have criticized. I find the artwork to be quite good, and more importantly, very true to the traditional symbolism of the Tarot. As a result, this deck is pleasing to my eye and to my mind, which makes readings more fruitful.I fail to understand the criticisms leveled by some that the art is not &quot;dark&quot; enough. Certainly the Ten of Swords still holds its power. The symbolism of The Devil, of course, has no horned boogeyman with ridiculous medieval overtones, and maybe that's what some of these people are referring to. However, the actual symbolism of the card, the idea of being in bondage to something that is negative, is still intact.Overall I find this deck eminently useful and very well done. I would recommend it highly as a first deck, or as an addition to a collection. Either way it is highly commendable.

The American Godzilla looks like Dennis Rodman in a lizard suit, despite the much-vaunted CGI trimmings. Jean Reno and Matthew Broderick are totally wasted with this vacuous plot. Maria Pitalo, as Broderick's girlfriend, is irritating beyond words to say. I kept hoping she would end up getting eaten, or stomped or something.The thing that destroyed this movie for me was the ham-handed, brain-dead, typically American &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the Godzilla legend. They cheated him out of his fire breath, and they gave him a sex change. The addition of Jurassic Park/Aliens style little Godzillas that chase everyone all over the place was...well, just dumb.Independence Day was fun and stupid. In that movie, Emmerich and Co. took all the biggest cliches of UFO attack movies and created a loving, loud and ridiculous tribute. Here, they miscalculate. There's too much stolen material (particularly from Alien and Jurassic Park), and they obviously don't &quot;get&quot; the Godzilla legend, nor can they figure out what to do with it. They failed to understand the truth that in every Godzilla movie, Godzilla is the hero and the main point of interest. Here, Godzilla is just a monster, and the movie tries to distract us with subplots and people. Emmerich &amp; Co. didn't understand that nobody really cares about the humans in a Godzilla movie; they're secondary, only there to react to Godzilla himself.I was totally disappointed and irritated by this poor attempt at a Godzilla film. Fortunately, after this movie's disappointing box office performance and critical reviews, the studio dropped Godzilla like a radioactive rock. Toho quietly revived the fallen and disgraced King of Monsters, and brought him back in fine style with &quot;Godzilla 2000,&quot; which I would recommend wholeheartedly over this terrible, boring, annoying movie.

And all the boys with motorcycles want cars!&quot; (H. Wiggin)The Shaggs are beautiful. Their music is beautiful. It's utterly uninfluenced by anything earthly. I can't believe how many reviewers here don't &quot;get it.&quot; Sure, Betty, Helen and Dorothy Wiggin don't sound all smooth and pretty-like. If you want smooth and pretty, there are lots of other CD's for you. Go ahead, buy Jewel or Mariah Carey or Pearl Jam. Be mediocre, certainly there's enough mediocre music out there to satisfy you.But the Shaggs are in no way mediocre. The Wiggin Sisters are for real.They are YOU....The Shaggs were you, but instead of retreating into their shells they picked up their instruments and made a lovely racket....the Shaggs glow eternally, hovering far above the filthy land of mediocrity, three angels in knee socks with cheap imported guitars.And &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; is their blessing on us all. Those who know, know. They smile with Wigginlike serenity. Foot Foot is indeed their pal. Those who don't know will never know; as Rumi said, &quot;It Is What It Is.&quot;

This CD has everything the other YLT CD's lack; melody, energy, a sense of humor, wit, and heart. I don't understand why their other CD's can't be this good. The rest of their catalogue is interminably drony, lackadaisical, ironic; they sound like they don't care if they're making a record or not and don't want to make an effort either way.Here, they sound alive, funny, and committed to making music. Their cover of &quot;Speeding Motorcycle&quot; is the best one, hands down. &quot;Emulsified&quot; is a riot. &quot;Yellow Sarong&quot; is the perfect evocation of the psychedelic 60's. Even their cover of the Kinks &quot;Oklahoma, USA,&quot; though it doesn't hold a candle to the original, is full of heart and honesty.This is a great CD, in short. Why don't they approach their own music with this kind of joy and conviction? I don't know. I bought four Yo La Tengo CD's in an effort to see what all the fuss was about, and after giving them all a fair try and keeping them around for a year, this is the only one that I can honestly say I like. And to be fair, I like it a lot.This is probably the only Yo La Tengo CD you'll ever need. And you do need it, if you like good pop music.

Jonathan writes rock and roll songs. They could have been written in the 1950s or 1960s, but there's also a sense of timelessness about them. Like Ray Davies, Jonathan doesn't write about Big Subjects. He writes about everyday clothes, cappucino bars, love, and occasionally Bermuda or Vampire Girls for fun. And like Ray Davies, his focus on the everyday, combined with his big heart, makes him one of the best rock songwriters ever.This is a grand collection of the music he did for Rounder Records. Jonathan sharpened his focus and honed his craft during his time on Rounder, and this terrific selection of songs shows that. Most of the music here is Jonathan as a solo artist ("believe me, it's better that way") putting his heart out there, as open as the sky and beautiful as the moon. The material ranges from the rockin' (Parties in the USA, Dancing In The Lesbian Bar, Fender Stratocaster) to 50s-style country (Reno, The Neighbors) to wistful balladry (The Girl Stands Up To Me Now, You Must Ask The Heart). Every song on here is a gem waiting to be discovered.There's not much any reviewer can say that can match the songs themselves. Jonathan's interviewers and attempted biographers all find a guy who hasn't got much to say about his life or his music. That's because his life is his music, and his music tells you all you need to know about Jonathan. His music is clear and honest and speaks from the heart, and in the final analysis, that's exactly what music is supposed to do. To Jonathan's credit, that's what he's done since the Modern Lovers days, and that's what he says he'll do "until it stops being fun." Let's hope it stays fun for a long, long time.

My wife and I watch &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; on TV every year, but not because we're religious. This has to be one of the most inadvertently funny movies ever made. Charlton Heston is at his most biliously histrionic. Yul Brynner manages to be cool even though he's stuck wearing a miniskirt. But they're not the ones you should watch for.Watch out for the details. In the beginning of the film when a well-oiled, buff Moses brings the spoils of Africa, he introduces the very black and very hot &quot;Princess Therbis&quot; who is introduced to the Pharoah. She cuts her eyes at Heston and states in a low, sexy purr, &quot;He is wise...and strong.&quot; The way she says it, sounds like Moses conquered more than territory. This bit of unexpected innuendo is especially hilarious considering Heston's current standing as Mr. Super Conservative White Guy.Look out for Anne Baxter as Nefretiri. She's the only one in the movie who &quot;gets it.&quot; It's obvious she can't take this hokum seriously, so she turns Nefretiri into a Bettie Page-like sex kitten, a hoochie girl of ancient Egypt. She lounges lasciviously. She undulates snakily. She purrs and growls her lines mercilessly. She oozes RAW SEX. And boy, does she have some lines. &quot;Oh Moses, Moses, you stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!&quot; is just one. When Moses returns from the mountain all gray and done up like Wolfman Jack, Baxter/Nefretiri pulls him aside and slathers herself all over him for old times' sake. &quot;Your wife...does she smell of myrrh as I do, or does she have the odor of...sheep?&quot; Baxter is outrageous, one reason to watch this camp classic.Other reasons? Count how many times Heston says &quot;BONDAGE.&quot; Count how many times you see shirtless buff male slaves being whipped by equally buff male Egyptians and wonder... Watch Vincent Price ogle and leer his way across the screen. Edward G. Robinson in blackface, his New York gangster accent as out of place as a pork roast at Passover. Of course Yul Brynner saying &quot;So it is written...So It Shall Be Done!&quot;The special effects and sets are extremely spiffy for the '50s and still look pretty good today. But the real fun of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; is to watch it as though it were a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. It's hilarious. And one final thought: is it just me, or is it slightly weird that DeMille supplied the voice of God?

From the point of view of someone in 1922, this must have scared the daylights out of people. We now are a lot less frightened; gore-driven horror films and hyper-realistic special effects have inured us to a lot of things that would have scared our great-grandparents into unconsciousness.But even now, Max Schreck's performance is sublimely creepy. His Orlok/Nosferatu is not the suave sexual vampire of post-Bela Lugosi times. He's an incarnation of sickness and disease, whose totem animal is the plague-carrying rat rather than the bat. He seems to carry the miasma of the grave, of rotting wood and mold and things that have decayed too far to even have the stench of death any more.The other actors' performances are sometimes laughable and hammy, no doubt about that. Greta Schroeder only seems to get into her character at the end, while Gustav Von Wangenheim, well, his performance is just plain odd and sometimes guffaw-worthy.But Schreck, as Nosferatu, drains the inadvertent humor away, and makes you watch him every time he's onscreen. He makes your skin crawl looking at him. It's brilliant work for an actor in that period, handicapped as they were by the absence of sound and color. Schreck seems to use these handicaps to his advantage, almost as if he knew they were there. It's a very prescient role, in a sense; he set a tone, and put across a unique vision of the Vampire, that has never been matched or equaled.The association of Nosferatu with the Black Plague is clearly drawn. Nosferatu does not offer the vampire life as an eternal party where one never grows old. He offers a vision of the vampire as someone who is ill unto death but cannot die. He draws the life from others to keep himself at the edge of survival, while causing others to die from the disease he cannot let himself succumb to. He points up something the other vampire movies do not address; the survival of the vampire is a trade-off. He trades the Devil your life for his. This makes the vampire worse than a simple predator. It makes him diseased in both mind and body, and willing to spread that disease. Schreck's Nosferatu puts this point across with chilling power.Yes, the restoration is as good as could be expected, especially considering this movie was thought to be utterly destroyed at several points in its history. And I don't have a problem with the new music, although I can see why some people prefer to play gothic rock while watching it. (Nick Cave, in particular, would go well with this movie.)But the real reason you should see this is to watch Max Schreck, to watch Murnau's direction (which is an artistic statement in itself), and to sit and think about the question of what Nosferatu represents. Nosferatu will not scare the pants off you. But in the night, in the wolf hours, he will lurk at the back of your mind. And what he represents is more frightening than anything his descendents have been able to show us.

This was actually the first Velvets album a lot of us ever heard if you were growing up in the mid-70s, as their original albums (except for "Loaded") were all out of print and impossible to obtain in most areas of the country. I first heard it in about 1976 on 8-track tape. I remember listening to it in my dad's car, which was the only 8-track tape player in the house, idling the car with the window open so I wouldn't die from gas fumes, listening to "What Goes On," and thinking, "So -this- is what all the fuss is about."This isn't the furiously aggressive Velvets of the John Cale/Warhol/Factory days, as others have noted. With Cale's exit from the band, and the addition of the far more pop-oriented Doug Yule to bolster Reed's move back toward more basic rock and roll, some people regard this as a watered-down version of the Velvets. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's true, the songs sound different without Cale, but the new versions of the songs reveal different aspects that were sometimes lost underneath the ferocious howl and drone of Velvets Mark I. This is the version of the band that Jonathan Richman saw and fell in love with, and it's not hard to hear that influence in his music, as well as the music of most of the lower-key post-rock bands these days."Live 1969," also gives us a chance to hear Sterling Morrison and Lou Reed play guitar. Sterling, who was terminally underappreciated, really shines here with his tough, blues-based solos and solid backing for the songs. And of course Lou Reed's anarchic, fuzz-zapped guitar is perfectly on target, whether he's grinding out buzzsaw solos or rattling jagged rhythm guitar.It would be nice to have this remastered properly and in one complete package, instead of broken up over two CDs, and it would be nice if it had real liner notes instead of a dated essay by Elliot Murphy (anybody remember him?), but in this life you can't have everything, and these two CD's contain a lot, even in their current state.

Most people, when they think of jazz organ, think of Jimmy McGriff or Jimmy Smith and their blues-jazz workouts. This is completely different. Larry Young created an ensemble around himself that works to create unified pieces of music in a modern jazz style that owes more to John Coltrane than Jimmy Smith.Young works with the ensemble in a very giving way. He does take impressive, Coltranesque solos, but this is no &quot;Look at me, I got a big B-3&quot; organfest. Everybody here is a capable soloist, and everyone takes turns being brilliant and being supportive. Young didn't even write most of the tunes, wisely letting his bandmembers contribute their compositions. And those compositions are good; angular and modern without being strained or pretentious, and melodic without being cloying.There are a lot of jazz critics who claim that this is the best jazz organ record ever made. I can't say that, because I haven't heard every jazz organ record ever made (and because I still have a soft spot for Jimmy Smith's &quot;The Sermon&quot;). But this is definitely right up there among the top 10.&quot;Unity&quot; is definitely not just another jazz organ jam session by any means. If you're a fan of progressive jazz played by sensitive and well-spoken players, you'll dig this CD. This is the good stuff.

This is Hawkwind in a late 70s-early 80s hard rock mode. I never can actually think of &quot;Shot Down In The Night&quot; as really a Hawkwind song, but the boys do a damn fine job of it. After that it begins to sound pretty much like Hawkwind. There is a very late 70s-early 80s sound to the recording that really put me off at first, but once I got past that I found a lot here to like. Granted, it's not &quot;Space Ritual&quot; or &quot;Doremi,&quot; but the Hawkwind that did those albums will never be again.The versions of &quot;Brainstorm&quot; and &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; here are lusciously guitar-heavy and build up to a very satisfying roar; they deserve to be heard in their own right. The sound quality is also very decent, unlike a lot of other live Hawkwind albums. My major complaint with this is the aborted version of &quot;Silver Machine,&quot; which is ended with an explosion just as it takes off; I wish they had just left it off completely. Why it was included is a mystery to me.Overall you could do a lot worse. I wouldn't think this would be a CD for the beginning Hawkwind listener, but for a fan this provides a good look at where they were in 1979. And people who enjoy 70s hard rock in general will find a lot here to like. Not indispensable, but solid nonetheless.

This is really a huge mess of an album. The cover bodes ill; Lou wearing more makeup than he has since "Transformer" days, apparently distracted from gazing into a mirror, and looking as though he'll glance back at the mirror any second and get lost in the mystery of his own gaze.That's pretty much what's happening here. Lou seems to be trying to pull off something here, but it's impossible to figure out what; the sped-up voices, the fake jazz inflections, the dreadful studio-musician glaze, the bad lyrics and unemotional singing, all add up to the nadir studio recording of Reed's Arista years.I am a big Lou Reed fan, but I am NOT willing to cut him this much slack. "Transformer" and "New York" stand in stark contrast to this as testimonials to what he's capable of when he's really trying. Unfortunately, through most of his Arista years, he wasn't trying very hard. It really shows here.

Stephin Merritt's songs are sad and incisively perceptive. They also have melodies that cannot be removed from your mind. At first I was thrown by the music, which consists of various cheesy 70s and 80s synthesizers and drum boxes driven through numerous effects - something like if Abba had been produced by Brian Eno with help from Butch Vig - but once I got used to Merritt's soundworld I was immediately hooked. Definitely worth spending a lot of time with.

Side One, or the first six songs on the CD, are pretty cool. They're not always completely successful; &quot;Que Vida&quot; contains some inane lyrics, &quot;Orange Skies&quot; is a little too close to pure schmaltz for me, and occasionally Lee's overprecious enunciation is unintentionally funny. But overall their sense of experimentation and the great melodies win out, and on &quot;Seven And Seven Is&quot; and &quot;She Comes In Colors,&quot; they hit it out of the ballpark. If they had stopped there, &quot;Da Capo&quot; would be a great 60's psychedelic pop EP.Unfortunately, there's &quot;Revelation.&quot; All right, I have to be fair; when the sax player takes over halfway through, some cool stuff happens, but that only lasts a few minutes, and otherwise you have to put up with Arthur Lee doing a bad Jim Morrison/Mick Jagger impersonation, guitar solos that make the joke solos from the Bonzo Dog Band's &quot;Canyons of Your Mind&quot; and Dr. Hook's &quot;Cover of the Rolling Stone&quot; sound like Jimi Hendrix, and a drum solo that, frankly, should never have existed.Overall I can't say this album is worth it. You would be better advised to get &quot;Love Story: 1966-1972,&quot; which contains the six good songs from this album, as well as the good stuff from Love's first album and all of &quot;Forever Changes&quot; (which really is as brilliant as everyone says it is).As a side note: I'm surprised that &quot;Revelation&quot; gets nods from people as being &quot;the first&quot; side-long jam epic. It certainly isn't, and even if it was, it's probably one of the worst examples of a &quot;jam&quot; I've ever heard.&quot;Revelation&quot; was isolated on the second side of the original vinyl album, and sure it looked impressive, but it's only 18 minutes long, not very long in &quot;jam&quot; terms. The Velvets' &quot;Sister Ray&quot; is seventeen and some change and they managed to include &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; on side 2 of &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; as well.It's nice that there are people who are such fans of Love that they will attempt to revise the history of rock for their sake, but saying that &quot;Revelations&quot; was the first &quot;sidelong jam&quot; is just completely wrong. I suppose it's hard to come up with reasons to justify &quot;Revelations,&quot; though, so the fans get points for trying.But let's be clear: Butterfield Blues Band's &quot;East/West,&quot; which happened in 1966, was the first rock/jazz jam-out, and it was the one that inspired a lot of people (including Cream, Arthur Lee, and Hendrix) to try and integrate the improvisation of jazz with the energy of rock.

&quot;Yellow&quot; is a pretty song, although a little light in the lyrics department. The rest of the album, unfortunately, sounds exactly like &quot;Yellow.&quot; The same formula applies; a wash of acoustic guitar, winsomely morose lyrics, medium tempo...and pretty soon it becomes hard to tell one song from the next...and pretty soon, you're not interested enough to keep on listening. I hate to admit this but I used the &quot;skip&quot; button on this one more than once. There simply isn't enough going on musically or lyrically to make this more than an occasional listen. I'm particularly puzzled by folks who claim their lyrics are &quot;deep,&quot; because they're nothing of the sort; the lyrics are barely there at all, and revolve around borrowings from the Morrissey Book Of Wistfully Morose. And musically, I'm bothered by the fact that &quot;Yellow,&quot; and the rest of the songs on this CD, are basically rewrites of Radiohead's &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; from &quot;The Bends.&quot; I think this CD is a great example of a band who landed a record contract without enough good material to fill up a CD. Maybe on their second CD they'll actually write more than one good song, but knowing the state of Britpop these days, I seriously doubt it.

I was excited when this came out, because I'd heard there was &quot;new material&quot; on it. Being a fan of the Fripp/Eno albums, I expected something interesting. The &quot;Healthy Colours&quot; material was a total disappointment. It was then, and it is now, just a bunch of noodling. To be more precise, all the &quot;Healthy Colours&quot; pieces sound (a) too Eno-dominated and (b) incomplete and lackadaisical. The high points here are the tracks reprised from the other two Fripp/Eno collaborations. Which brings up the question, why not just buy &quot;No Pussyfooting&quot; and &quot;Evening Star&quot; instead? And the answer to that is...well, you probably should. This can be missed.

Let's get rid of some myths about this great CD.First of all, &quot;Free Jazz&quot; is NOT CHAOS. Listening to this all the way proves it; &quot;First Take&quot; is the same piece, and if you compare &quot;Free Jazz&quot; and &quot;First Take,&quot; you will see similarities and structure. So let's get rid of the idea that this was &quot;totally improvised&quot; first. There is an underlying structure to this piece, and you can figure it out if you try.Secondly: it is NOT ATONAL. What is happening here is that several different melodies are going on all at the same time, but each melody that each musician plays is meant to interact with the melodies the other musicians are playing. There are no chords, and there is no ESTABLISHED, FORMAL tonal center. But just because there is no FORMAL tonal center, doesn't mean there isn't one.Third: It is NOT AMELODIC. There are lots of melodies here. If you listen to it, you can find lots of melody. They may be odd melodies, but they are there. In particular, everything that Eric Dolphy plays and everything that Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman play makes perfect sense melodically. You may not agree with their tone choices or with the concept of &quot;harmolodics&quot; that underlies this piece, but listening to it, you will find melody.Fourth: IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO. The other reviews compare this music to higher mathematics and imply that listening to this is impossible unless you're an intellectual. The best way to approach this music is with NO PRECONCEPTIONS, including the preconception that you have to be an &quot;intellectual&quot; to appreciate this music. &quot;Free Jazz&quot; is a futuristic version of the early jazz bands, where everyone played solos all the time over a melody that was not played but generally understood. The only difference is that here, there are several melodies, all of which interact, and the piece is set free from strict 4/4 time.The best way to listen to this is to forget what everyone tells you about it, and just let it happen in the room. Let it play all the way out, even the &quot;dissonant&quot; parts, and listen to it. Listen for the funny parts, the humorous asides, the way Ornette's wry lemony sax contrasts with the dry growl of Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet and Don Cherry's rounded trumpet. And please, don't miss Scott LaFaro and Charlie Haden having a bass conversation, or the way that Billy Higgins and Ed Blackwell interact with each other; these four people are counted among the best on their instruments, ever, and what they do here counts.Don't treat this as abstract, intellectual, &quot;weirdo&quot; music. Listen to it without any preconceived notions. Don't compare it to anything else. Let &quot;Free Jazz&quot; be free; that's part of the meaning of it. Just listen. Then listen again. Then you'll get it. Promise.

Spacemen 3 are one of the most overrated and overhyped bands of the 80s. Everyone seemed to want them to be the Second Coming of the Velvets, but they truly lacked the imagination, the melodic sense, and the sense of drama. That being said, this is probably their second best album, but only in the TAANG! edition. Its major flaws are that the songs are mostly all in the same key, and their drones are not really that interesting. Pluses: &quot;Walkin' with Jesus&quot; and &quot;Take Me To The Other Side.&quot; But in all honesty, Spiritualized is a much, much better band. And the near total absence of any drums does not help at all here. Even the Velvets needed Moe Tucker slamming that bass drum to keep in line. Without any earthbound roots, too often the Spacemen dissolved into empty, purposeless blizzards of feedback. Overall the CD has a numbing effect. Listen to it once a month and you'll get something out of it; more often than that, and it'll seem dead boring.

My first reaction to this was &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; The &quot;new sounds?&quot; They're all taken from Can records from the 70s. The production? Obviously influenced by Eno/Lanois and, again, Can. Innovative, it's not. The contrast between Tricky's voice and Maxine's is the thing I liked best about this, and the lyrics are often clever and interesting. But ultimately this CD was killed for me by the repetitive nature of the tracks. I don't have a problem with repetition; Can, Neu, Eno, Terry Riley are all in my CD collection. But if you're going to use repetition in music you need to make it interesting. On a lot of the songs here it sounds like Tricky put all the machines on automatic and just let them run. Once he gets his groove set, he doesn't modify his loops or samples; he just lets them go on without him, which eventually lends a dull, samey feeling to the record. This CD could have benefited from every track being shortened by two to five minutes, and a lot more of the vocal interplay between Tricky and Maxine would have been welcome.A lot of the people who were fascinated by this CD are not people who listen to a wide variety of music, which I suppose is to Tricky's advantage; people who don't know any better think he invented this style. But he didn't. He is an adept synthesist and a good thief; which is not bad, David Bowie has built an entire career on being the same. But as far as being an innovator, he isn't.

The good parts of &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; are amplified a bit here; there's better lyric writing, the contrast between Tricky and Maxine's voices are played up, the sampling and programming draws on a wider range of sounds, and the production is ace. But the same thing that hurts Maxinquaye hurts this one as well; the unchanging repetitive nature of the songs. If you're going to do a long repetitive piece, you HAVE to mess with the sonic density and texture of the piece to keep it from being numbing, or even worse, snooze-inducing, and once again, Tricky fails to do that. As a result, like Maxinquaye, this could have benefited from having anywhere from one to five minutes lopped off of every single song. I don't have anything against long songs or repetition, but when the repetition isn't going anywhere sonically and doesn't have a purpose, what's the point? Check out Aphex Twin, early Tangerine Dream, later Hawkwind, Harmonia, Can, and Eno to hear repetition done right.This could have been a four-star CD with better editing and more sonic innovation. But ultimately it fails in its mission, and by the end of the CD it trails off in a miasma of sameness. Too bad.

Waters without Gilmour is melody-free and as mean-spirited as they come. Conversely, Gilmour without Waters is brain-dead and tedious. This record is vastly overproduced and under-composed. Somewhere along the line Gilmour even lost his beautiful guitar tone, and traded it in for a sterile-sounding roar. It's hard for me to tell one song from another on this record; the only emotion I feel is a vague sense of relief when Gilmour stops singing the dreadful lyrics he and his girlfriend concocted to bridge the gaps between aimless meanderings. Roger Waters wasn't the Pink Floyd, but this is proof that David Gilmour isn't the Floyd either. Just bloated, brainless corporate rock, as psychedelic as Quaker's Oatmeal and a lot less interesting.

There's nothing more awful than a comedy that isn't funny. Apparently the folks who made Galaxina were going for a kind of space-movie parody with sex, but there is exactly ONE funny bit in the movie. The bikers on the distant planet who worship Harley Davidson by bowing down to a motorcycle and going "Vroom! Vroom!" That's it. It lasts about 10 seconds, and pfft, end of funny. Quite honestly, has there EVER been a funny space-movie parody besides "Galaxy Quest?" Ever? Nope. And this one isn't either. The jokes are so bad, and so labored, and take so long to arrive, and are delivered so badly, that it's agonizing.The sex part? THERE ISN'T ANY. Not unless you count the scene in the space bordello, which is neither sexy nor funny. So the movie fails on both counts; it's not funny, and it's not sexy. It just sort of flops around from disconnected scene to disconnected scene. All the guys in the movie are slimy cheeseballs with open shirts and ASCOTS. And then there's Avery Schreiber. Avery Schreiber. Who told this guy he was funny? Can we sue them? Was he funny? Ever?And what was this movie shot on? I mean, the whole film is blurry. It's out of focus all the way through. I've seen MP3's with better image resolution than this movie.The only thing that might make this dreadful failure worth watching at all, for even five seconds, is Dorothy Stratton. Poor Dorothy. She can't act, of course, but she is beautiful, even in the sublimely stupid outfits they put her in here. And she goes through this thing like a trooper, doing exactly what she's supposed to, which is act like a robot.Trust me, this movie's not even good no matter how many of whatever substances you imbibe. It's too awful to even make fun of. It's just plain awful. Unless you are absolutely obsessed with Dorothy Stratton or you have some weird need to collect every bad science fiction movie ever made, avoid this like the plague.

From the flat out spooky opening chords of "Eko Eko Azarak," this CD seems to come out of the speakers and flood the room with a thick, dark, smoky presence that is almost tangible. On top of this, the songs stick in your head for days; a neat trick for doom/stoner metal, which often tends toward sameness. This is advertised as "Electric Wizard Mark II" on the liner notes and indeed it is; as heretical as it may be to say this, I find Mk II to be a more focused band with better musicians than Mark I. There, I said it. I found their earlier releases somewhat monochromatic at times, but with the addition of Liz Buckingham on second guitar there's a lot more going on in terms of the density and the sinister way the instruments intertwine around each other like giant cosmic serpents mating in the void. (Yeah, I said that and I mean it, deal with it.) The flow and fury of this is easy to get caught up in and I find it hard if not impossible to extricate myself from it. And best of all, I don't want to. I want to luxuriate in this wickedness like Baudelaire in an opium den with an exotic woman and a bottle of absinthe.

What else could the dedicated kaiju fan want? Well, OK, only one thing is missing here: the cheesy &quot;Save The Earth&quot; song from Godzilla vs the Smog Monster, but in the liner notes they explain they didn't have the rights to put that one on the CD. Otherwise, every major theme from every major Godzilla movie is right here, in both glorious mono and stereo, plus a monster battle, and of course &quot;Mothra's Song,&quot; complete with lyrics for same (in THREE languages!) in the liner notes. (In reference to which, beware: the minds of small children can easily absorb and repeat this song ad infinitum...)The writing and orchestration here is indeed worthy of serious attention. Akira Ifukube wrote some great themes, and under a lot of pressure as well. There are some fine moments here and anyone interested in film scoring would do well to pay attention to Ifukube's work.But the real fun with this disc is seeing how many childhood memories it brings back of camping out in front of the TV, eyes glued to the screen, waiting breathlessly in between commercials to see whether Godzilla would triumph over his numerous enemies, watching plastic toy tanks melt under his breath and balsa-wood skyscrapers splinter under his assault. The recent triumphant return of the _real_ Godzilla in &quot;Godzilla 2000&quot; ensures that our favorite radioactive dinosaur will continue to delight kids of all ages for years to come. May there be many more soundtrack CD's to come.

This is, in my opinion, THE theremin recording to have in your collection. Ms. Rockmore's touch on the instrument is unbelievable. Her command of dynamics and pitch on this notoriously difficult instrument is impeccable, all the more considering that this was recorded when she was 76 years old! We can only wonder what it was like to see and hear her in the 1930s and 1940s, when Ms. Rockmore played the Theremin as a soloist with symphony orchestras.On this recording, she is only accompanied by the sensitive piano playing of her sister, Nadia Reisenberg. The result is a quiet, intimate recording that ably showcases Ms. Rockmore's ability to serve the music through the instrument she so obviously loved. Ms. Rockmore treats the music with the touch of a true virtuosa. On any instrument, a performance this good would be amazing. On the theremin, the music attains a magical quality that's impossible to describe in words.This is far from a novelty recording, and should be in the collection of any serious music lover.

There are a lot of pagan authors who write books that are simply rearranged versions of the knowledge that they acquired from other books, with the result that their books are either overly academic or completely 'fluffy.' Evolutionary Witchcraft is neither of these. T. Thorn Coyle is a serious, longtime practitioner in the Anderson Feri tradition, and she also brings her work with Sufi tradition into play as well. Evolutionary Witchcraft is a book for people who wish to go beyond 'Wicca 101' and start to peer into the mystery that is the Self in relation to the Divine. It is a book that will take people who are witches much farther down their path. It is a quantum leap ahead of most books on Witchcraft and Paganism. Engagingly written and powerfully motivating, Evolutionary Witchcraft is not for the unserious or the beginner, but for someone looking to deepen their path and their relationship with the Gods, it's a must-have.

Andre Williams has survived more than most of us ever will. In the 50s and 60s he worked on the fringes of the rock/R&amp;B field, issuing sleazy records like &quot;Bacon Fat&quot; and &quot;Greasy Chicken,&quot; and working as a producer. A stint in Ike Turner's post-Tina band helped him acquire a severe drinking and crack habit that landed him on the street. He struggled back from addiction and began making records again in the 90s.Far from being 50s R&amp;B records, Williams' current CD's are skull-cracking exercises in the kind of depravity that the late Screamin' Jay Hawkins used to indulge in. &quot;Silky&quot; is a triumphant, raging comeback of filthy-minded (and filthy-mouthed) garage rock that sounds like the musical equivalent of the wildest night you ever had, multiplied by 10. He drawls and growls his way through songs like &quot;P*ssy Stank,&quot; &quot;Bring Me Back My Car Unstripped,&quot; and the frankly frightening &quot;Agile, Mobile and Hostile,&quot; with impressive panache, especially considering he's 65 years old. This is music to get drunk and pick up strippers and steal a firetruck and rob a bank to.Back in the day, there used to be preachers who would refer to rock and roll as the Devil's music. Andre Williams' &quot;Silky&quot; is exactly what they had in mind. Listen now, repent later.

Without this record, Eno's &quot;Another Green World&quot; and Roxy Music's &quot;Avalon&quot; would not exist. Less frenetic and more meditative than their earlier albums, vocalist Damo Suzuki subsumes himself into the band sound, becoming another instrument in the band. He, Jaki Liebezeit, Holger Czukay and Michael Karoli create the first &quot;soundscapes&quot; in modern rock. Eerie, beautiful, funny, and so multi-layered that every listen reveals something you missed the last time you heard it. This is a CD you could listen to for the rest of your life, and you should. Essential for all biped primates.

Basically this is THE album that every late 70s, 80s, and 90s college-rock, avante garde, and &quot;alternative&quot; band stole their ideas from. On this album, Can invents the music that would be stolen from them by the Fall, U2, David Bowie, the Talking Heads, and a lot more bands who get more credit than they should for doing what Can invented here. Compositions, musicianship, (especially the drums) production techniques, and attitude at least 20 years ahead of its time. This stuff will still sound exciting and strange in the year 2099 as it does now. A real must-have CD.

An eerie album of uncertainties and shadows, made darker somehow by the occasional bombastic moments, and capped off by Syd Barrett's frankly frightening &quot;Jugband Blues,&quot; one of the most truthful documents of mental illness ever recorded on any media. If you call yourself a Pink Floyd fan and you don't have this CD, you're not really a Floyd fan. This contains some of their best and most experimental work and deserves to be more popular among Floydians than it is.

After the loss of Barrett the band took some time to come back together, and &quot;More&quot; is proof that they were, with Gilmour, coming together as a band once again. Not everything on here is great, but there are some really lovely songs, such as &quot;Green is the Colour&quot; and &quot;Cymbaline,&quot; and an overall meditative atmosphere...except of course for the proto-metal stomp songs, which sound more like embryonic punk rock than anything else. A very diverse and underrated album. I agree with other reviewers that I would certainly rather listen to this than endure any of their albums after &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot; It is a pity, though, that there is no legitimate Floyd album that captures the heights that the band used to hit when playing extended versions of &quot;Cymbaline&quot; and &quot;Green is the Colour&quot; live.

Cut to the chase. The four stars are for the first disc, which is the only time that the live Floyd of the early 70s was heard properly on a non-bootleg album. As horrifying and anarchic as anything Sonic Youth or the modern industrial bands ever did, and almost (almost!) as powerfully psychedelic as Amon Duul II. The second disc is completely dispensable, except for Waters' beautiful &quot;Grantchester Meadows.&quot; Gilmour's &quot;Narrow Way&quot; is aimless noodling, and the less said about Mason's and Wright's solo pieces, the better. But man, that first disc...

On a Today show interview in 2001, Ringo Starr was asked &quot;Are there any of today's musicians you would like to work with?&quot; Ringo's laconic reply was &quot;No.&quot; Listening to this remastered version of &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; it's not hard to figure out why; after working on this with George Harrison and the other musicians on here, what else would you need? There really isn't any music this good being made by any current &quot;rock groups.&quot;This is an elegant, ornate album, with many, many brilliant songs. George would never hit such a pinnacle again (although many of his solo albums have great songs). Apparently being denied the opportunity to have his songs put on the Beatles' albums was beneficial to George in the long run.&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is expansively melodic and richly detailed, and the remastering does perfect justice to these moody, atmospheric songs. That should be recommendation enough to get it. The extra songs, including George's revision of &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; are nice but ultimately unnecessary; the essence of this CD is still George's original album. It was his declaration of independence from The Beatles, his introduction of his new self into what was then a new decade, and most touchingly, his declaration of love for his Lord Krishna. We may not share his beliefs, and some closed-minded souls may have a problem with the richness of the production in this postmodern era, but the passion and beauty of George's music comes through powerfully all these years later. And in comparison to the work of most so-called &quot;musicians&quot; these days, it still outshines all but a very, very few.

This is an edited version of a soundtrack to a movie from the 1960's, "Tonite Let's All Make Love In London." The soundtrack from this film has been released in a variety of covers and under a variety of titles over the years, but essentially, they are all the soundtrack to "Tonite..." with some of the spoken-word pieces from the original album edited out.The versions of "Interstellar Overdrive" and "Nick's Boogie" on here have already been released by a number of record companies on a variety of labels, notably as "In London: 1966-67." The remainder of the music on here is from a nearly random assortment of artists. The only notable performances, besides the ones by the Floyd, are those of the Small Faces and Allen Ginsberg.This is not an indispensable recording by any means. If you can find the Floyd's selections by themselves on another CD, you'll probably want to pick that up instead. However, if you haven't heard these versions of "Interstellar Overdrive" and "Nick's Boogie," and you're a fan of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, you might well enjoy this. And it's not terribly expensive.The contributions from the other groups are frighteningly normal in contrast with the Floyd's performance, and demonstrate how different from their peers the Floyd really were.As it is, this is not an indispensable recording. It's interesting to listen to as a general indication of what was going on at the time, but outside of the extended pieces by Pink Floyd the rest is pretty inconsequential. This version of the CD may currently be out of print, but rest assured, it will probably pop up again soon under a different title.

A lot of people are unnecessarily afraid of Ornette Coleman because the words &quot;free jazz&quot; and &quot;avante-garde&quot; have been applied to his music. But his music is quite approachable. This album is a great place to start for people who are new to Ornette. This album caused a stir in 1959 when it was released, with jazz critics exploding in wrath. The reason for all this furor? Ornette chose not to use a chordal instrument on this music. No piano, no guitar. He and Don Cherry harmonize to imply chords, and occasionally Charlie Haden (bassist supreme!) supplies the occasional three or four note chordal riff, but mostly the music consists of melodies (and very melodic solos) played over an implied structure. Ornette's tone is sharp and lemony on the sax, while Don Cherry's cornet tone is sweeter and more rounded. They state themes and then toss melodies back and forth, while Haden and drummer Billy Higgins interject and support. The music on this album is like listening to four intelligent, funny people having a conversation. The musicians are obviously listening to each other and bouncing ideas off one another, which is exactly as it should be in jazz. The music is played with wit, soul, and emotion, and in spite of the skeleton crew instrumentation, the melodic and rhythmic ideas are of such quality that you can listen to this CD many times, and get something new out of it every time. How many records can you say that about? I wish more of the new jazz artists would base their creations on this kind of innovative, interesting music, instead of rehashing the same old swing and bop cliches as they tend to do. Ornette's &quot;Shape of Jazz to Come&quot; is still as relevant as ever. Listen especially closely to Charlie Haden's bass playing on this CD and note how far ahead of his time he was; there wouldn't be a more innovative jazz bassist until Jaco Pastorius came along twenty years later. This is indeed the shape of Jazz to Come; hopefully one day the rest of the music world will catch up, because I guarantee you the world will be a better place when they do.

This movie is not a literal reading of Washington Irving's story, and only the most naive moviegoers would expect it to be. What it actually is, is a very clever update of the classic Hammer horror film formula.Hammer Film Productions produced excellently creepy British horror films in the late 50s, 60s and 70s, most of them involving Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (or occasionally Vincent Price) and truckloads of actresses stuffed into &quot;buxom wench&quot; costumes. The Hammer formula was to take a well known story - usually something by Edgar Allen Poe - load it up with sex, gore, bosoms, and weird plotlines - and let it loose.The presence of the venerable Mr. Lee himself at the beginning of this movie is a dead giveaway; this is Tim Burton's tribute to the classic Hammer Horror films. As such you're not meant to take it too seriously. Like the original Hammer horror movies it emulates, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is strictly for entertainment. Slightly gruesome entertainment, yes, but since when have horror movies been tasteful? And bear in mind the Hammer films were also criticized for the heapin' helpin' of gore they provided as well.However, Burton goes Hammer one better by giving us a complex storyline that would be well-suited to a detective movie, with suspicion swirling around everyone. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane is delightful. His Ichabod Crane is always balancing between wanting to fall over in a faint at the horrors he sees and wanting to investigate the weird happenings he comes across in Sleepy Hollow.I never thought to use the words &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;Miranda Richardson&quot; in the same sentence, but it happens here. Christina Ricci has been criticized in other reviews for giving a subdued performance, but her primary purpose in this movie is to look sweet (which she does) and fill out a corset and some low-cut gowns (which she also does to perfection). In short, she plays the same type of role as Hazel Court used to in the Hammer Horror films this movie recalls. That doesn't require acting skills so much as it does a soulful gaze and major cleavage, both of which Ricci has in abundance.To sum up, this movie is a lot of fun, and should not be taken terribly seriously. Burton does manage to throw a few barbs at fundamentalist Christianity, and at times he seems to have a definite sympathy for what appears to be a version of Wicca that some of the characters practice. However, this is really nothing to get riled about; once again, refer to the Hammer Horror precedents for this movie (The Curse of Frankenstein, The Horror of Dracula, etc.) or The Wicker Man (another Christopher Lee film) for a similar sideways look at Christianity, twenty to thirty years earlier.This movie works as both a suspense flick and a respectful but tongue-in-cheek tip of the hat to Hammer Film Productions. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you want a good evening of horror film fun, rent this, Vincent Price's &quot;The Fall Of The House Of Usher,&quot; and &quot;Horror of Dracula,&quot; and have yourself an evening of 19th century horrorifics. You'll be glad you did.

This is basically a novelty record, for the most part. It's a little frustrating, because underneath the sugar coating and the self-conscious wackiness, there are some interesting ideas and sounds here, as on &quot;White Pepper Ice Cream.&quot; But they never allow themselves to actually stretch out, and instead of going for something really interesting, Cibo Matto settles for being just cute and funny.Nothing wrong with that, but in many places this CD comes off as being very self-consciously cute and very self-consciously funny, and too much self-consciousness is very bad for cuteness or humor. After a while the cuteness begins to sound forced and the humor a little strained, and it stops being fun. Something else that doesn't help is the unfortunate tendency the girls have to let their machines run them, instead of them controlling the machines. Most of the songs on here are too long and too samey; they find a groove and a sound on each song and lock it in. It's like they're too inexperienced to experiment and play with the sounds they can make. A good remix would have done wonders with this album.As it stands, this is a cute fluffy CD. But you can't live on cute and fluffy forever. Cibo Matto is going to have to grow up a bit and get darker if they want to be more than a novelty.

I am a long-time REM fan, from their first album. I might as well be straightforward; this is yet another snapshot of a band sliding downhill fast, a slide that started with "Monster," and has only gotten worse since then.Basically, this sounds like an "adult contemporary" group from the 1980's. I personally don't believe that Peter Buck or Mike Mills are on here at all, I don't care what the liner notes say. Mills and Buck had a distinct personality and presence on their older material. I can't tell that they're on here anywhere. There is an anonymous, even soulless, quality to the music on here.The one overwhelming presence is Michael Stipe, emoting embarrassingly maudlin lyrics over some extremely overproduced and over-orchestrated music. The tunes are not memorable, and oh my God, are they SLOW. Hey guys, if you hadn't noticed, rock music has made a bit of a comeback. Really! It's OK to have audible guitars and drums, and to play at tempos approaching, oh, a fast walk at least, instead of this geriatric amble.But even if they had picked up the pace, there's still no good songwriting to be had here. At best it sounds like second-rate Fleetwood Mac from the 70's, and at worst...well, Air Supply.It really is time to hang it up, guys.

This is possibly the most boring piece of crap movie I have ever seen. It's about a baby-faced tub of lard who picks a series of girls up off the street, dragging them back to a little green cinderblock room where he kills them in the least convincing manner I've ever seen, with pathetic amounts of fake gore and spectacularly unconvincing special effects, while his horribly ugly mom watches from a little window surrounded with clothespins(?!?). He then wraps their heads in bandages and throws their bodies in a warehouse. THERE IS NO OTHER ACTION IN THE MOVIE OTHER THAN THIS. That is all he does, over and over again. For 81 miserable minutes. THAT IS ALL THAT HAPPENS. There's not even any good nudity.This must have been made as some sort of tax write-off. Maybe some mentally ill millionaire paid these people to make this sad waste of digital media happen. You could spend hours trying to figure out why anybody would make this piece of cinematic fecal material, but it would be as much of a waste of time as actually watching this alleged movie. Either way, watching this movie should be counted as Torture under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. I heartily recommend that someone at the U.N. buy every copy of this movie as well as the original master copy, and burn them with fire. Then round up the producer/director and imprison him, her or them for life. In solitary confinement. It would be better if this movie never existed. It makes Manos: The Hands of Fate look like high art.

The day after Tony Randall passed, I pulled out my DVD of "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao," one of the oddest movies in Randall's long career. It's also one of my very favorite movies of all time.The plot is pretty simple. Dr. Lao, a strange Chinese gent, comes riding into the dying town of Abalone, Arizona on a yellow donkey. A catfish in a bowl rides behind him. He comes into town to stage his circus.His arrival comes at an interesting time. Clinton Stark, the town entrepreneur, is at loggerheads with newspaper publisher Ed Cunningham. Stark has just made an offer at a town meeting to buy out all the property in town stating that the water main is collapsing and the town doesn't have enough money to repair it. However, Stark's real motive is that the railroad will be coming through town and he can turn a mighty profit on selling the land to the railroad. The townsfolk are just about ready to sell out; Stark's offer sounds good and Abalone is in the middle of nowhere. Editor Cunningham is suspicious, and so is Angela Benedict, the town librarian. Ed's in love with Angela, but she's still wearing her widow's weeds for a husband eight years dead.Into all this rides Dr. Lao, who sets up his circus...a circus of the mind where no one who walks through the tent flap remains unchanged.I will tell you this: this is a corny movie, and everything does turn out all right in the end. The special effects won an Academy Award in 1964, but they are stop-motion effects (from director George Pal) and the makeup and effects are limited by time and place.And yes, there's a kid and even a dog. Don't hold that against this film. In its defense I will say thatit was written by Charles Beaumont, the writer responsible for a number of classic Twilight Zone episodes. And there are more than a few edgy and even frightening moments here, far more than anyone should expect from a "family" movie in 1964.For example, the completely frivolous Mrs. Cassin goes to visit the seer Apollonius of Tyana to get her fortune read. Mrs. Cassin's character is that of a beauty past her bloom, a snobbish, gossipy and silly old lady who still fancies herself the belle of a long-forgotten ball. Having her fortune read is a lark to her. She ventures into Apollonius' tent.The first time you see Tony Randall as Apollonius, you think, "Oh jeez, Tony Randall in a blonde wig, mustache and beard." Yes. True. But his face. Randall's Apollonius looks infinitely old, infinitely tired. In essence the corny-ness of the makeup is destroyed by the way Randall holds himself and speaks. In spite of yourself, you find yourself believing that this is an infinitely old and sad man who sees the future, and maybe doesn't want to.Mrs. Cassin, flustered by Apollonius' faraway attitude, eventually ends up taunting him. Her true nastiness emerges as she finally says, "I paid you! go on then, tell my fortune!"In one of the most chilling moments in the movies (and I will defend that statement), Apollonius tells her:"Tomorrow will be like today, and the day after tomorrow will be like the day before yesterday. I see your remaining days as a tedious collection of hours full of useless vanities. You will think no new thoughts. You will forget what little you have known. Older you will become, but not wiser. Stiffer, but not more dignified. Childless you are, and childless you will remain. Of that suppleness you once commanded in your youth, of that strange simplicity which once attracted men to you, neither endures, nor shall you recapture them...When you die, you will be buried and forgotten, and that is all. And for all the good or evil, creation or destruction, your living might have accomplished, you might just as well never have lived at all."Randall says this without judgment or malice, in an infinitely sad and infinitely empty tone. If you do not feel the icy wind of fear across your soul when you watch this, you're not paying attention.Mrs. Cassin rushes out of the tent weeping. When Angela Benedict, the Librarian, finds her, Mrs. Cassin's face snaps back to its usual phony cheerfulness, and she chirps, "Oh, it was quite interesting. Do you know, he told me that I shall marry Mr. Stark!"Ah, Angela Benedict. Angela is played by Barbara Eden. A young and quite luscious, brunette, Barbara Eden. Before Jeannie. Benedict is clinging to her widow's weeds to avoid the attentions of Ed Cunningham, to avoid rejoining life. And Angela Benedict ventures into the tent of Pan.Yes, Pan. the Great God Pan. Once again the shortcomings of the makeup(according to our modern technology) are overcome. Pan begins to play his pipes and dance around Angela. She loses her balance. The music gets wilder. The tent is gone; we are in a forest. She loses her focus. Her schoolmarm's dress becomes undone at the neck. She sweats. Her hair falls out of its bun. Pan's likeness changes; he looks like Ed Cunningham, but Ed Cunningham with horns and hooves, half-naked, powerful, laughing, taunting her, enticing her.There's no sex, not even a kiss at the end of this scene; only a very young and very, very beautiful Barbara Eden clinging to a convenient tent pole, or is it a tree in the forest? coming undone, sweating, gasping, and completely under the spell of Pan. And again, if you don't find this scene intensely erotic, you're not paying attention.In short, folks, even though this film is corny and has technical flaws according to our 21st Century standards, it is far outside the boundaries of 1964, and touches on things that no other movie has. Suspend your disbelief and see this movie.I will leave you with this, from a scene where Dr. Lao is talking to Mike, who is Angela Benedict's son."Mike, the whole world is a circus if you look at it the right way. Every time you pick up a handful of dust, and see not the dust, but a mystery, a marvel, there in your hand - every time you stop and think, 'I'm alive, and being alive is fantastic!' - every time such a thing happens, Mike, you are part of the Circus of Dr. Lao."

Granted, John Mayall's vocals are just this side of terrible; it wasn't until his Silvertone releases that Mayall's voice became anywhere near convincing. But that's not what you should be buying this for. You should be buying this to listen to the excellent group playing, and of course Peter Green's guitar. Peter is a more subtle and more soulful player than Eric Clapton, and his instrumental here, &quot;The Supernatural,&quot; is the blueprint from which Carlos Santana has built nearly every solo he's ever played. Even though this CD does contain one of the worst versions of &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; (here called &quot;Dust My Blues&quot;) ever recorded, this CD is well worth having for fans of blues guitar, period. Peter Green is the man who B.B. King said gave him the chills, and he never said that about Eric Clapton - or any other guitarist for that matter.

There is a reason why this was one of the worst-selling albums of its day.It's awful.It consists mostly of pseudo-baroque pop written by the Giles brothers. The music is sluggish and overfamiliar, and it reminds you of too many things you've heard before. It comes off as bunch of Veddy British Fellowes trying too hard to be whimsical and fey, and failing miserably.Occasionally Robert Fripp will play something that sounds distantly like a King Crimson riff, or some musical passage will come into view that is almost interesting, but then some silly narration comes in or some musical cliche will intrude and it sinks from sight, never to be seen again.I personally can't figure out what they were trying to do here. Were they trying to be pop? It's too slow for pop music and there aren't enough hooks. Were they trying to be psychedelic? There's nothing mindblowing or innovative going on. Were they trying to be funny? Well, sorry to say, it's not very funny. The Bonzos had them beat hands down at that game. Were they trying to be brave and carve out their own niche in music history? Well, maybe that's what we should give them credit for with this album.And they did carve out a niche. People who put out a debut album this bad seldom go on to do anything good, so the fact that King Crimson grew like a strange rose out of this pile of, let's be polite, fertilizer is indeed notable.Even if you're a Fripp fan, a psychedelia fan, or a 60's music enthusiast, you are not missing anything at all by not having this in your collection. And collecting it would be the only reason you'd want it; listening to it would be a terrible mistake.

The songs don't really begin or end, they sort of drift into the room and drift out. The vocals are extremely undermixed. Too much bass and drums. Too many slow songs, no energy, all pothead music, people just too stoned to do anything and laying around staring at the TV type music. Unmotivated, unmotivating, dull, sleepy. Listless. The rap bit in the second song is annoying but fortunately it's undermixed, like all the rest of the vocals, so you can barely hear it. And this goes on for almost AN HOUR AND A HALF.Some advice for D'Angelo: (1) CD's usually have songs on them, try to write some next time. (2) Stop smoking so much pot, it's affecting your music in a bad way. (3) Mix down the bass and drums, or if not, try to get them to play on the beat. (4) BUY A SHIRT ALREADY, OK!?

Let's face it. If you don't have all these songs already, you probably don't like music. But if you buy this CD, which is essentially the record company's mix tape of &quot;everybody's favorite&quot; Beatles songs, you probably still don't like music. These are songs that most everyone can sing from memory. Why Capitol decided we needed yet another collection of Beatles hits is a mystery to me. Oh wait, I figured it out...THEY DID IT FOR THE MONEY. Why would you even consider buying this rubbish? Save your money and buy the original albums. Or better still, buy something new, by a new band, who need the money far more than Sir Paul, George or Ringo ever will. If Lennon was alive he'd tell you the same thing.

The real complete history of Rickenbacker is found in Richard Smith's &quot;Rickenbacker: History Of The Rickenbacker Guitar,&quot; which I would recommend over this book. This book, like most of the Bacon and Day books, is fine, as far as it goes; the only problem is that they never go quite far enough. There's never enough hard info in a Bacon and Day book, and that's true of this one as well as all their others. I will say one thing though, lots of terrific pictures. But that's about it. If you want to know the story behind one of America's foremost guitar companies, you need to pick up Smith's book. This is mostly useful as a picture book.

Obviously, Don Byron loves klezmer.I am not sure I do.A lot of this CD seemed, well, needlessly obscure. The weird Messaen-like opener clashes harshly with the music that follows, and goes on far, far too long, and is heavy with the portent of political meaning. The comedy routines are incomprehensible on two levels; one is because they're mixed down below the music, and secondly, well, because they're largely Yiddish comedy, and if you're not Jewish...you won't get it, because it's mostly in Yiddish. That's not putting anybody down, please don't get me wrong. It's just that the comedy routines in another language are a bit disconcerting, like watching a Telemundo comedy show and wondering what everyone is laughing about, and feeling vaguely uncomfortable because you don't get it.On the plus side, the playing here is immaculate and witty. The musicianship is at a tremendously high level, and there's a lot of good music here. But you have to get through some bad and/or incomprehensible jokes to get to it, and man, the "Prologue" and "Epilogue" are just funereally gloomy.If you can bypass, understand, or bear with the comedy routines, there's a bunch of good music here, but for a lot of listeners I would suspect that this would be hard to "get" properly without first educating yourself on who Mickey Katz was, the time period he lived in, the history of the bad old pop songs parodied here, and learning a whole lot of Yiddish. And, no offense to anyone, that's a bit more work than even I want to go through when listening to a CD.I really don't think this is as effective as "Bug Music," by a long shot. I understand why Byron finds Katz interesting, and I understand why he thinks Katz is important, but the music should have been the focus, rather than the alternately schmaltzy/incomprehensible comedy routines and song parodies.As it is, this is an interesting CD, brilliantly performed, of a perhaps undeservedly ignored American composer...but I doubt seriously I'll be listening to it a lot.

This album is a masterpiece because it contains beautifully written, played, and produced pop music. The lyrics are heartfelt and yet knowing, and the music is a swirl of shining beauty. Comparing this band to Coldplay is frankly insulting; Coldplay only wishes they could write a song as absolutely wonderful as &quot;Heavenly Pop Hit.&quot;If the Chills were a &quot;second tier act,&quot; that was no fault of theirs; when this record was originally released, their United States record company had no idea what to do with them and gave them no promotion. I was lucky enough to see them live on a brief tour of the U.S., and Martin Phillips and co. were every bit as good live as they were on this record. The Chills should have been one of New Zealand's most famous imports; album after album of great stuff, and this one is possibly their best.The reviewer from Switzerland has snow in his ears. This is one of the great lost rock albums. Miss it, and it's your loss.

This is a brilliant piece of work, a run-up to the greatness that is "Picaresque," and some of the Decemberists' best work so far.But if you want a really interesting listening session, put on "The Tain" and then follow it up immediately with "Pictures of a City" by King Crimson off their neglected album, "In the Wake of Poseidon."Interesting, no? I wonder what else Colin has been listening to besides Black Sabbath?Regardless, "The Tain" is more proof that the Decemberists are rapidly becoming one of the more impressive bands around. They are not locked into anyone's formula and don't follow anyone's rules but their own. In an era where so many bands follow lockstep with one another ("Coldplay, meet Starsailor, I saw you both going through Radiohead's Pink Floyd rarities collection!") and so many others go whoring after money and popularity, the Decemberists' singular disregard for anything except their own artistic vision is beyond refreshing.

Yo La Tengo is one of the most overrated, underachieving bands in the increasingly lost morass of "indie rock." For years now they have gotten by somehow, making music that is primarily a lame pastiche of their rock-critic influences, and out of all those albums they've produced only one that's honestly worth listening to.This isn't it. This is more of the same drony, Neu-meets-the-Velvets-on-Nyquil junk that they've been anesthetizing people with for years, with not a single interesting thing about it. The tunes stay within a five-note range, the lyrics are entirely colorless and forgettable, the instrumentation is the same old buzz/twang/drone they've been using for years. The songs blur into one another, and it's impossible to tell them apart, not only from each other, but from the songs on their previous albums. Calling this CD "monochromatic" might be too interesting a word to use for something this boring and numbing.Why do people continue to assert that YLT is a "great band"? Beats me. There's no proof of it here.Incidentally, for those curious, the one great record that YLT has done is "Fakebook," and they didn't write any of the songs on that one. There is a lesson in that.

A gob of songs taken out of context and plopped carelessly on one CD, like the mashed potatoes in your school lunch plopped on your tray by a hairy-legged cafeteria lady. Why this was ever issued in the first place is a total mystery to me, and why it was re-remixed and reissued is even more of a mystery. Keep this monstrosity out of your house.

I freely admit that science is not necessarily my strong suit. I have nothing against it, but I often get lost around a mental corner. I have to admit that this is what happened with this book. The author conveyed his enthusiasm for the subject and for maverick scientist Luca Turin, but to be honest, I didn't quite understand what all the enthusiasm was about, and I am not sure I liked Turin as much as the author did. I got a little tired of Turin, actually, long before the author did. The aspect of the science of scent was interesting, to a certain extent, but after a point I found myself skipping passages that seemed to go on too long and get too mired in arcane scientific specifics. Overall I don't think this is a general readership book as much as it is a text that could be useful for someone in the field.

I had no idea who Steve Burns was, but I am a Flaming Lips fan, and when I read that they were working with this strange fellow from a children's TV show, I got curious. I followed the link to Steve's website, listened to the songs, and decided I had to have this.The music is expansive, open-hearted and nerdy in a good way, and occasionally reaches liftoff, as on &quot;Mighty Little Man,&quot; which deserves all the good stuff said about it. Sure there's a Flaming Lips influence; there's a lot of that going around these days, which is why Dave Fridmann (producer) stays busy. Occasionally, &quot;Songs for Dustmites&quot; sounds like an alternate-universe Flaming Lips, one without the melancholy of Wayne Coyne's overall vision. The beeps and swooshes frame songs that are more upbeat and hopeful than Wayne Coyne's, and Burns' voice is probably a bit easier for some people to handle than Coyne's Neil-Youngish yawp. However, there are also songs that don't sound like the Flaming Lips at all, as in &quot;&gt;1&quot; with its prominent fingerpicked guitar, and the moody neo-folk-space-jazz of &quot;A Reason.&quot; And to be fair, the influence of the Beatles and David Bowie (especially early Bowie of the &quot;Space Oddity&quot;/&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; era) is at least as present. (there's also a spot on &quot;Troposphere&quot; where he sounds like a dead ringer for David Cassidy! but don't tell anybody.)Overall this is a thoroughly charming and intriguing CD, and I can tell already it will reward closer listening. This is the best debut CD I have heard this year. I have a feeling we're going to be hearing more from the newly un-green-shirted Steve Burns.

This was recorded in 1952 (or thereabouts) and although it's just called "Sonny Terry," Brownie McGhee is on here too. However, the focus is pretty squarely on Sonny, so I guess the title is legit.On the negative side, there are a lot of duplicated songs and the sound quality varies widely. On the positive side, "Sonny Terry" has much less of a sanitized feel than the later Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee releases. There's a sense here that they're not aiming this at an audience of white folkies.Sonny's harp playing is terrific, and he sings in a tough, down home style that speaks volumes about his roots. Brownie McGhee even plays electric guitar, in a much different style than many of their fans are used to hearing. It's pretty clear that Sonny, Brownie and the group are all having a good time, too; on "Harmonica Rumba" this is particularly evident.The instrumentation is different here than on other Terry/McGhee releases as well. As mentioned, Brownie plays electric guitar instead of acoustic. On some takes there's even an organ player (!!) and on almost all takes there's a drummer.As a result, this rocks a lot more than some of Sonny and Brownie's other, more folky material. To put it bluntly, this CD doesn't have that Pete-Seeger-Presents smell to it, which is just fine by me.Very worthwhile for someone who already has Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee CD's in their collection. I don't know whether it's a good place to start if you've never heard them before. However, if you want an insight into what Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee were like before they cleaned up their act to join the "folk boom," this is exactly the thing. Wonder what this CD would sound like if it were properly remastered, though...

If you've been hearing people name-drop Sun Ra and you wonder what the deal is, this is a great place to start. At first listen it may sound like big-band jazz, but then you start noticing the oddities; the dual baritone saxophones, the way the Orchestra jumps out of standard jazz structures and into pure modality, Ra's odd chord choices...but you'll hear them for yourself. Gradually you realize that this is not ordinary jazz. On other excursions (i.e., albums) Sun Ra can snatch you rather abruptly from Planet Earth, but here he does magic to tempt you into boarding. And then before you know it, you're cruising the spaceways. If you are a Sun Ra fan you know how delightful this is; if you are not, this may change your mind; and if you don't know who he is, why, step up and meet the Man from Saturn!

At first listen this sounds pretty exciting, but after a few times through their influences begin to weigh in rather heavily. The two-guitar attack is very reminiscent of Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd's work with Television, which is not a bad thing, but it's been done. The vocals are a very astute combination of Iggy Stooge and Richard Hell.The songs tend to get samey, but I think this is a result of the production, which is calculatedly "raw." A touch of reverb wouldn't have hurt, guys. The "singing through a megaphone" effect that they stick on Julian Casablancas' vocals doesn't help either. The production, basically, is really deadening to the ear, which detracts from the songs. This is too bad, because the songs are (mostly) quite strong and the lyrics bear listening to several times. The guitar work, despite being derivative, is right on the money throughout.I wish I liked these guys more than I do. They have the right attitude and the right moves, and I suspect they may even have their hearts in the right place, but there's an aura of calculatedness that throws me off, and the production is really not all that good.If they survive the hype, the Strokes may develop into a great band; the seeds are certainly here. If they don't "Inside The Music" themselves out of commission with hype, drugs, groupies and what-not, they will put out a determinedly great CD. This isn't it, but it's worth hearing.

The legendary Herald sessions are (partially) presented here, remastered and sounding great.These 1954 recordings have Lightnin' on electric guitar with bass and drums, something that wouldn't happen again for a while. The album that this CD reproduces, &quot;Lightnin' and the Blues,&quot; didn't sell, incredible as that may seem now. The market for Lightnin's style of blues was disappearing among black audiences, and record companies were too dumb and/or shortsighted to really try to market the blues more widely than among that audience.Fortunately for him, Lightnin' was &quot;discovered&quot; a few years later during the &quot;folk blues&quot; boom of the 1960s, where sanctimonious folkies looking for the &quot;pure blues&quot; recorded any bluesman they could find - as long as he was playing acoustic guitar. Lightnin', never one to pass up an opportunity to make a few bucks, pulled out the acoustic and obliged, to the tune of about half a million albums' worth of material.Unfortunately, the vast amount of acoustic material Lightnin' cut tends to overshadow his electric guitar work, which is at the center of this CD. His electric guitar playing is raffish, offhanded, sly, sinister, and altogether engaging, exactly like his songs.Lightnin' recorded with bass and drums subsequent to this, particularly for his Prestige/Bluesville sides, but the drummer and bassist on those recordings were altogether too polite and stolid. Here, his accompanists push him, and Lightnin' pushes back, distorted amp and all. This rocks, seriously, and bear in mind this was in 1954, when rock and roll music was largely pudgy white fellas with well-pomaded quiffs playing accelerated versions of swing music. Lightnin's hairy, rough, driven take on the blues here is years ahead of its time, probably one reason why &quot;Lightnin' and the Blues,&quot; didn't sell like it should have in its day. In later years, listeners realized how great this album was, and collectors swooped in, soaking up the short supply of original albums, and keeping most people - even Hopkins fans - from hearing this important work.Here, however, we have the entire album plus extra cuts, in terrifically remastered digital form. Even if you have every other Lightnin' CD out there, you need this one, and if you have never encountered Lightnin' before, this is a great place to start.

This CD, Pharoah's first, shows him saddled with mediocre backing musicians and still very much overshadowed by his influences. Only occasionally do you hear the full throated cosmic-chaotic roar or the floating Zen melodicism found in his later work. It isn't surprising that this release didn't generate much critical interest; there's frankly not much here to hold one's attention. It is pleasant and occasionally interesting, but not anything more than that. It's probably best that this is out of print; it is of marginal interest only to dedicated Sanders fans who want to hear what his sound was like in embryonic form. He showed great promise here, but it was only promise.

After hearing Unicorn a friend once said to me, &quot;This makes me feel like I got too high.&quot; I had to laugh, because even though I love this album, I could see her point.This is Marc Bolan at his most exotic. It's acoustic hippie music, unabashedly so. The lyrics are so convoluted and peculiar that they're basically uninterpretable, and the various accents and pronunciations Bolan lays on them makes them even more arcane. Yet they seem to make their own internal sense in the highly peculiar context of this odd little album.The music is melodic and pretty, in its own strange way. The tunes are not complex, but Bolan and Steve Peregrine Took layer them with myriads of sounds. Toy pianos, harmoniums, various kinds of stringed instruments, ethnic percussion, and whatnot embellish all these songs and add a layer of homespun strangeness.I like to listen to this all the way through in one sitting, because breaking it up seems to ruin the mood. In a sense, all the songs here seem as though they are thematically connected, although on reading the lyrics they're not. There's just a unified feel to the whole album, which is why I don't want to dissect the songs in this review. It needs to be heard all together.This CD is not going to appeal to everyone. People who prefer the hard rock of &quot;Slider&quot; or &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; will be utterly flummoxed by this music. It's unabashedly fey and very English and bears no relation to &quot;rock&quot; in any but the most vague sense.But &quot;Unicorn&quot; is peculiar and delightful, the kind of music that very few people are brave enough to make any more. If you can put aside your modern cynical facade and enter Marc and Steve's world of faeries, mystic hinds, unicorns and other airy fairy &quot;nonsense,&quot; you may find yourself charmed and delighted. A keeper.

A female vocalist whose pitch is extremely wobbly and whose grasp of English is on par with her facility in ancient Phoenician. A guitarist and organist who can only play rehashed cliches from the worst, most bombastic British blues-rock bands, and can't even do that very well. A bassist and drummer who, well, the less I say about them the better off we all are. Songs that are so bad they sound like parodies of a progressive rock band. Combine all this together and you have the unfortunate experience that is Analogy.The capper is the cover, on which four of the ugliest people you have ever seen in your life are absolutely stark naked. The fact that the female vocalist is also nude is offset by the incomprehensible awfulness of the four guys, which totally destroys the "aren't we all beautiful here in the Garden of Eden" vibe they were apparently attempting to create.When people say they hate "hippie music," this is the kind of stuff they were talking about. Avoid this at all costs.

It really is hard to be a naysayer. To her credit, Irene Sage has a beautiful voice and is an exceptional live performer. Even on CD, it's obvious that she throws her whole soul into what she does and sings with all her heart.However, the unfortunate truth is that this CD is weighed down with songs that are mediocre at best. Like many New Orleans rockers, Sage is overfond of dramatic vocal gestures, and relies far too much on standard rock and funk cliches musically. There is also a good bit of overproduction on this CD, making it sound far more slick - in a bad, '90's way - than it really should.Like a lot of New Orleans artists, Irene is still in search of a definitive identity. Is she a belting balladeer? A white soul/funk chanteuse? A rock singer? She tries all of them here. Any or all approaches might work if (a) she stuck with one consistently and (b) the songwriting wasn't so uninspiring. I'm all for artists being diverse, but simply taking a bunch of songs and throwing them against the wall to see which ones stick is never a good idea. Very few artists can pull that off successfully, and I'm sorry to say that Irene is not one of them.Finally - and this may be nitpicking - the CD cover combined with the title is really a little disturbing.I wish I liked this CD better than I did. I've lived in New Orleans for a long time and I've followed Irene's career for a while, and she has always struck me as an inspired performer with a great voice, no matter what she did. But the scattershot musical approach, the over-reliance on cliches, and the subpar songwriting sinks &quot;Come On In.&quot;

Tight, rocking live show, not half as overblown as &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Animal&quot; or &quot;Lou Reed Live.&quot; Meaning that here, old Unca Lou was not yet in danger of parodying himself or his music as he did on his other 1970s live albums.He also had yet, at this point, to make an impact in America beyond the Velvets fanbase, so on this set he actually worked at playing a good show for once, singing instead of shouting/reciting the lyrics, and avoiding most of the mannerisms that marred his later work. Here he's performing with focus and directness. In other words, this is a pretty terrific live show, and better than nearly all of his other live albums.The much-reviled Tots (who got a lot of bad press in England simply because their names weren't Sterling, Doug, Maureen or John) do a fine job here of approximating Mick Ronson's arrangements of Reed's then-current &quot;Transformer&quot; album without hitting the overblown rockstar postures of the Wagner/Hunter era Reed band. The version of &quot;Berlin&quot; here is surprisingly effective, and &quot;Walk It Talk It&quot; is better than either the Velvets' version or the version on Reed's first solo album (the travails of which are hilariously outlined on the barely-literate liner notes on this CD).The interview is funny, not just because Reed says he hopes Doug Yule is dead, but because the interviewer then reveals he went to school with Yule, forcing Lou into the position of trying to make nice with the interviewer while retaining his bad-boy rock star posture. Aside from the novelty factor, the interview isn't all that, and after the first time you hear it you'll probably hit the skip button. It should have been stuck on at the end after the actual music, rather than breaking up the flow of the show as it does.But enough of the critical stuff. If you're a Lou Reed fan, you'll want this for sure. If you were a Lou fan but gave up on him after some of the admittedly dreadful junk he did in the late 70's and '80s, you might want this anyway to remind you of why you liked him. And if you're a newcomer, you'll want this after you get Transformer, simply because it's actually one of the better Lou Reed live albums period.

Richard Smith's book is simply the best available on Rickenbacker guitars. The Rickenbacker story is presented directly and simply. Of course there are lots of insanely cool pictures of Rickenbacker guitars. An invaluable source of information for the collector, or for the normal guitarist, a great book to just plain read. I gave this four stars instead of five because of the spelling errors that reoccur throughout the book. As opposed to the Bacon/Day Rick book, this is not just a quick gloss of the company's models but an indepth look at the company. I hope Smith updates this book every so often. As it stands it is the best reference on this subject in its field.

There is really no reason this double-CD set should be out of print. Slim Harpo was one of the most popular bluesmen, period, denting the top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic. Granted, there is a very good &quot;Best Of,&quot; but to get the full range of Slim's talent, you need to hear this 2-CD collection.Slim Harpo was highly influential. The Who copied his &quot;Got Love If You Want It&quot; and renamed it &quot;I'm The Face,&quot; a song you can find on The Who's &quot;Meaty Beaty Big &amp; Bouncy.&quot; The Moody Blues named themselves after one of his instrumentals. A quick listen to &quot;Tip On In, Part 2&quot; will shock any Creedence Clearwater Revival fan who thinks Fogerty (great as he is) invented that swampy sound.Not only was Slim influential, he was one vital guy. He changed with the times, as this set shows. He was equally adept at blues, ballads, and rock and roll, and in the later part of his career was exploring the beginning roots of funk. (James Brown had Slim open for him on tour - that should tell you something!) To this day, you can hear bands in New Orleans doing &quot;Te Ni Nee Ni Nu&quot; and filling up the dancefloor when they do. He wrote most of the material on this collection, much of which is still in the repertoire of blues bands everywhere. Slim was always developing his sound and never got stuck in a musical rut, like many of his contemporaries did. If he had not died before his time, no telling what he would have done.As it is, even though he left us too soon, he left us with a lot of great music, and this is one of the best collections of his music. It's simply criminal that this is out of print. If you get a chance to get this, do. And maybe someone will get sense enough to put this back out one of these days.

There was a time (and it was a better time than the one we live in, at least musically) when Lightnin' Slim was known all through the south. He and Slim Harpo ran neck and neck for the title of "King of Louisiana Swamp Blues."In our wicked times, Lightnin' Slim is almost unknown, and this CD has gone out of print. Crack open your wallet and pony up the cash for a used copy if it's here, because if you're a true blues fan, you will - I mean WILL - want this. Lightnin' Slim played the real, low-down blues with no watering down or juicing up. It's so stripped down that on half of the tracks here there isn't even a bass guitar, just Lightnin', a harp player (usually Lazy Lester or Slim Harpo) and a drummer. And that's all he needed. Hard, hard blues about bad women, bad whiskey and bad luck abound, with nasty guitar sounds and cutting harmonica riffs. If you dig the Fat Possum style blues releases, here's where they got the idea. Only Lightnin' Slim was doing it back in the 40s and 50s.The CD spans his whole career and includes many of his great songs like the title cut, "Nothin' But The Devil," and "It's Mighty Crazy." Everything on this CD is 100 percent solid, serious Louisiana swamp blues, adorned only with the patented Excello echo that adds an eerie feel to the slower songs.It's criminal that this is out of print and so much garbage that passes itself off as "blues" is floating around out there stealing people's money. Find this CD and get it; you won't be sorry you did.

The first thing you hear on this CD is Wolf's unearthly moaning/humming. It gradually increases in volume until it becomes huge, frightening, and distorted. The reason it's distorted is because his voice is overloading the mike. The sound you hear is the mike fixing to blow up. You're hearing the elements of the microphone being rattled by Wolf's gigantic voice. They didn't have equipment that could take the Wolf full-on. Similarly, no one CD is going to contain all of the Wolf; he was just too damn big. But this CD has all the stuff that sent people like Mike Bloomfield and Jimmy Page scuttling into their bedrooms to try and cop the licks. What they never could imitate was the raw pure attitude of the Wolf, a mighty, mighty man among men, &quot;300 pounds of muscle and man&quot; as he says on this very CD.This CD has all the classic songs on it. If you know anything about blues you probably have this CD. If you're learning about the blues, GET THIS IMMEDIATELY. It makes nearly all modern &quot;blues&quot; artists sound completely pale and anemic. If you want a real laugh, drag out the Doors' first album and compare Jim Morrison's &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; with Howlin' Wolf's version on this CD. Then ask yourself who REALLY &quot;ate more chicken than any man ever seen.&quot; I think the answer will be painfully obvious. This is everything the blues should be: raw, dangerous, edgy, filthy with distortion, snarling guitar from Hubert Sumlin and Pat Hare. Raw visceral blues that does not compromise and takes no prisoners. If blues was liquor, Howlin' Wolf would be straight whiskey. Buy this CD and get drunk.

So says the man on &quot;You Can't Judge A Book By Lookin' At The Cover.&quot; He's right. Turn this UP. Get it to the point where Bo's guitar is vibrating your entire house. Let it shake all the dust out of the floorboards. Make your neighbors call the police. This music is worth a night in jail.Seriously, it could be argued that this guy was the forerunner of so many things. None of the British rockers of the 60's would be anywhere without Bo Diddley. The Who and the Stones in particular owe him a great debt, not just for the rockin' Bo Diddley beat but for the macho, right-upfront lyrics and vocals and the total rock-and-roll attitude. Not to mention the huge sense of fun that permeates the whole Bo Diddley experience.And that guitar! It's safe to say that nobody ever played electric guitar like Bo Diddley. He just turned on every effect available to him and turned it all the way up. It wiggles, it throbs, it bumps and it vibrates. And if you think the White Stripes invented minimal rock and roll, dig Bo Diddley. Some of this stuff is just his guitar and some maracas! Lean, mean, and ready to rumble.There are so many classic songs and so many innovations on here, it's impossible to pick one out and praise it too much. I'll just point out here that, among other things, Bo invented rap on &quot;Say Man,&quot; and that his use of rhythms that head straight back to Africa predate &quot;world fusion&quot; by about, oh, 30 or 40 years. Or the fact that he was one of the first rock musicians to have female instrumentalists in his band. I could go on and on, but you get the point.You cannot go wrong with this CD. I don't care who you are or where your head is at or what kind of subgenre of rock you dig; Bo Diddley had an influence on it. In many ways he was the &quot;Originator&quot; as he and his fansites claim. You owe it to yourself to pick this up immediately if you haven't experienced the one and only Bo Diddley. All your rock heroes (and heroines) already have!

Undeniably rich and ornate album, unapologetic in its reach and grandeur. Renaissance hit one of their high points here. Annie Haslam's vocals are right on the mark, the songs are melodic and memorable, and the instrumentation is complex without being obscure. Piano and organ dominate, and classical structures abound.People with a low tolerance for symphonic prog rock and long songs are advised to stay away. But for those who have a secret craving for the days in the early 1970s when bands were trying their best to turn away from being pop hit machines and create something better, this is a fountain of beauty and grace."Pretentious"? Yes. Everything that the punk rock revolution of the late 70's was trying to overturn? Yes. Fantastically beautiful and worth hearing again and again? Yes indeed.

OK, let's be blunt. This is not &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land,&quot; but it's pretty darn good. It may be the best book of its type (novelized spinoff of a successful TV series, that is) that I've read.The odd thing about this book (and the second book in this series as well) is that while I was reading it, I could almost see it play out as an episode in my imagination. The plotting, the characters, and the dialogue are very, very consistent with the series. In spite of the fact that the book is allegedly done by Peter David &quot;from outlines by J. Michael Straczynski,&quot; some of the dialogue seems almost certainly taken from unpublished or unused B5 scripts. There are many instances where Vir or Londo says something that has the ring of Straczynski's writing to it. Not to short Peter David in any way; his writing is quite adept and vivid, and keeps the story moving.I ripped through this book in a day; I couldn't stop reading it! I can't really say that about most books I read, but for me this one was a real page-turner. I thought the world of B5, although I'm not one of those fans who dress up as Minbari to go to science fiction conventions, and for me this book was an entirely satisfactory and very interesting expansion on one of the many unfinished storylines of Babylon 5. I would recommend this book unreservedly for any B5 fans, and even for those who are not familiar with the series (and shame on you if you aren't; it was the best science fiction series ever, and I've seen 'em all) it will prove a fascinating diversion.

Once again, as in the previous book in the series, I had absolutely no trouble seeing this played out in my mind's eye. The characters and dialogue are again very consistent with the TV series. The book moves swiftly and there are several striking scenes, impressive even if I had never seen the series. I was fascinated by the growth and the depth of Vir Cotto, who I always thought was an underused character on B5. Unlike other reviewers I thought that the treatment of Vir Cotto, and the changes he goes through here, were entirely consistent with the character and with the B5 storyline.One of Straczynski's recurring themes (and his imprint is all over this book) is that sometimes good people must do horrible things in order to accomplish what must be done for the good of all. This book explores that theme deeply. Vir's interior dialogue and the conflict between his heart and mind, as he does what most be done to save Centauri Prime, are well written. The book is darker and more sober than the first volume in the series, but the subject matter deserves the treatment. There are parts of the book where the action seems a bit hurried, but this does no damage to the overall storyline.As with the first book, I ripped through it; I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. This book is entirely worthy of the Babylon 5 imprint, and like the first in the series, it's probably one of the best spinoff-of-a-TV-series novels I've ever read, if not the best. I highly recommend it for B5 fans, and even for those who are not familiar with the series, it's a great page-turner.

Jim Burns was a true original in the world of the electric guitar. Burns guitars were like no other, and he was rightfully compared to Leo Fender. Both men had the same questing, innovative spirit, and both were utterly ingenious in their approach to creating electric guitars. Paul Day's &quot;The Burns Book&quot; is a wonderful tribute to and overview of these British guitars, and features comprehensive info on the Bison, the Hank Marvin models, the Jazz Split-Sound, the Scorpion, the Steer, and other beloved (at least on British shores) instruments. There is also some information on the Baldwin years, when American organ manufacturer Baldwin bought out Burns, and on Ormston and Hayman guitars, both companies that Jim Burns was associated with.Overall this is a fantastic book, especially for fans of rare guitars. The unfortunate thing about this book is that it is somewhat dated. More information about the Burns company and Jim Burns has surfaced since it was initially published, and the Burns Company itself has staged a comeback, with its unique guitars finally being available again in the United States.It is way past time for this book to be revised and reissued, with more (and better quality) photographs. Until then, this book will have to suffice, but it's still a great overview of a unique man and his innovative, distinctive guitars. Highly recommended for guitar junkies.

Zebra. To some people in New Orleans, the name still brings back shivers of horror. To others who identified with the hair-metal/prog-metal/bonghit crowd, they were a godsend. Beginning life as a Led Zeppelin/Rush cover band, they managed to conglomerate their influences into a few albums' worth of derivative, overblown stadium rock that remains popular with people with large hair, small brains, and no taste everywhere they played in the U.S. (mostly Louisiana and New Jersey).I have to give them credit for surviving. They continue to play live and make their version of music even after all this time. That takes some sort of dedication, and they deserve some praise for doing that. If you liked their previous albums, you'll like this one; it has all the hallmarks of their previous work. If you didn't like them back in the 80's, well, you definitely won't like them any better now. Their flaws (overblown grandiosity, sentiment passing itself off as emotion, and an absolute inability to create anything original musically) remain the same.But you have to give them their props; they're still out there, giving the big-hair crowds exactly what they want. And this CD is exactly what their fans want. Whether you will run to the stores to get this or run screaming the other way depends solely on where you were musically in the 1980's.But either way, somehow I don't think it'll make any difference to the un-killable, staunchly unevolved dudes in Zebra. I can see them playing the exact same stuff to the exact same crowd until they all succumb to old age or hairspray poisoning. Dude! RAWK! etc., etc. Bring your bong and a lighter, man...

I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band. All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception. Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I. A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band. If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total. If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like &quot;Painful.&quot; But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia.

Candye has had an outrageous life and an outrageous career, and judging by this sharp, expansive and swingin' CD, it's not over by a long shot. Candye sets herself up as a classically bawdy belter in the mold of early Della Reese, Ruth Brown and Big Maybelle, with a little Rusty Warren thrown in. And it works. For me there's not a bad song on here. It's absolutely the best CD to put in when there's a party going on. Even when the CD slows down for some questionable material (Didn't We and Highway of Tears) her big, warm voice carries it along anyway.A real surprise of a CD; I was familiar with Candye from her previous career in the, ahem, adult entertainment industry but had NO idea that behind the big beautiful exterior there was an equally big, beautiful music talent. Anybody who likes swing and blues, a little on the salty side, will dig this immensely. Candye might be the Toughest Girl Alive but I've always had a soft spot for Tough Girls. They've always got more substance than those prefab teen cuties.

A lot of bands from the 60s are making semi-comebacks these days through reissues of their albums and critical reappraisal, but quite frankly not many of them were as good as the Butterfield Blues Band. It's a complete mystery to me why Eric Clapton's early work is held in such reverence when it so obviously pales in comparison with what Mike Bloomfield did with the Butterfield Band.&quot;East/West&quot; was the Butterfield Blues Band's masterpiece. They had already shown on their first album that they had a definite command of the Chicago blues idiom. Here, they open up and branch out without losing the edge and drive of their first recording. The two long workouts, &quot;Work Song&quot; and &quot;East-West,&quot; are so far ahead of what anyone else in rock was doing (including the Beatles) that it isn't even funny. This was recorded in 1966, when most bands, if they played the blues at all, were thrashing around doing impersonations of British musicians impersonating the styles of American musicians. In 1966 it was unheard of to have extended solos unless you were playing jazz, and even then you could expect to be razzed by people with short attention spans.On &quot;East/West,&quot; the Butterfield Blues Band cheerfully dispenses with most of the reigning thou-shalt-nots of their time and proceeds to kick down the walls. This is a trend-setting recording that had more impact than people are willing to acknowledge, and it still rewards the listener. A lot of bands stole liberally from this album and have never paid back their debts. Don't you owe it to yourself to check it out and get the real stuff straight from the source?

I think that the positive reviews of this album have more to do with the happy memories it brings some of the reviewers than its actual musical content. Listened to today, the humor is heavy-handed and unfunny, the skits are annoying, and Flo and Eddie are unbearably irritating, whether they're singing or attempting to make jokes with a very snide and unpleasant Zappa. A self-satisfied, smug feeling of &quot;Aren't we so clever, making fun of pop music!&quot; permeates this disc. It's mean-spirited, snide and unfunny. I like a lot of Frank's work, and when he was at his best he could be very funny. This isn't his best work. Most unforgivably, the Mothers sound very tame and rote, with valuable playing time surrendered to the tiresome Flo and Eddie, whose appeal eternally escapes me. I gave this a chance long ago and it hasn't grown on me since. Give this a pass and get one of Frank's classics instead, like &quot;Hot Rats&quot; or &quot;Apostrophe.&quot;

This one was a real letdown for me. This is basically one of Frank's &quot;comedy albums,&quot; and like all of the albums where he concentrated more on being funny than making music, it's not too good. It hasn't aged well at all since the 80s, although I do give it two stars for some of the more astute lyrical jabs. The production is harsh, sterile, and ugly, with very dated synth and guitar sounds that sound like something off a Bon Jovi or Poison record. This is not helped by the presence of Steve Vai, who is, let us be honest, probably the most annoying, overrated guitarist since Eddie Van Halen.Overall, this is one of the few Zappa albums that you could live entirely without. There's so much else that Frank did that deserves your attention more than this. He was indeed one of America's musical pioneers, but you can't tell it by this CD.I am told that this CD has been remastered again since I bought my original Ryko copy. (I think that would make three CD &quot;reissues,&quot; the first one, the Zappa-supervised re-issue, and the non-Zappa supervised re-re-reissue.) But unless they recorded over all the synthesizer and guitar parts and replaced the songs (most of which recall &quot;Sheik Yerbouti,&quot; only less fun and more preachy), it's still not worth getting.

This is probably one of the most abysmally bad science fiction books I've ever read in my life.I can't figure out if Caidin was trying to be nostalgic and write in a 1930's pulp-fiction style, or if he thought he was trying to update '30's style writing to the present day, but in either case, the book is an astonishing failure, like trying to build a nuclear reactor out of styrofoam, wood chips and Elmer's glue.The book is quite frankly racist, to begin with. It's embarrassingly racist. No racial stereotype is left unmolested. You would think that someone at the publishing house would have spotted this gigantic faux pas, but apparently they were blithely blind to it. Secondly, the author is frighteningly enamoured of technology in general, and rhapsodizes for literally paragraph upon paragraph about things like polished mirrors, laser beams, and obscure parts and pieces of World War II aircraft. His techno-fetishism finally becomes hilarious. "Oh look, a bolt! Wonder how many pages he could write about it?"Third, the plot is a huge mess with no point. Fourth, the characters have about as much depth as your average business card. Fifth, the book is sexist as well as racist.But let me be positive. What good things can I find to say about this book?Well, it's easy to read, except for the parts where Caidin starts going on and on about technical details of Messerschmitt ME 109 aircraft. And, um...it's funny, although inadvertently so. And the hardback copy I found, had a copy of Phil Nowlan's original 1933 "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" novelette bound in the back.The sad thing was that Nowlan's novelette, which was originally offered as a prize for mailing in your cereal boxtops, was far more interesting at 31 pages than Caidin's entire novel. And since Nowlan's "Buck Rogers" is being sold here at Amazon without the dead weight of Caidin's book attached to it, you now have no reason to buy Martin Caidin's "Buck Rogers: A Life In The Future."Thank whatever gods you believe in that this enormous mess of a book is out of print. And if you see it in a used book sale at a library, like I did, LEAVE IT THERE! I wish I had...

You would think that with this band, this would be a great disc, right? Sadly, it's not all that great. Lou and Quine were at loggerheads at the time. As a result, Quine's guitar is oddly muted and minimized on much of this. As much as I love Lou Reed, and I do, he will never be the guitar player that Robert Quine was. This CD suffers, as a result, from Lou's lack of guitar skills - even on his own music, by his own standards. The second thing that makes it a not-buy is Lou's refusal or inability to sing. He simply shouts his way through all the songs. The third reason to give this a pass is that there are no dynamics. All the songs are played as loud as possible, meaning that ear fatigue sets in a little over halfway through. It begins to sound very samey after a while. Lou's best live set remains the semi-bootleg "American Poet" album. Even for a Lou Reed fan, this is not a must, I'm sorry to say.

This best-of rips the lid off of David Hasselhoff's career. Here, on this collection, is the music that has influenced Bono, the music that Radiohead plays on their tour bus, the music that has brought about the sweet lovemaking that has caused birth of literally dozens of German children. The voice, the face, the shining star of delight that is the glamorous glaze of his gaze. Oh sure, you have your Charos, your John Teshes, your Yma Sumacs, your 98 Degrees, but they all pale before the open edifice of raw, steaming talent that is David Hasselhoff. And on top of all the heaps of infectious songs ("Hot Shot City" is particularly good), the incredible, unbelievable quality of Hasselhoff's edematous voice, on top of EVERYTHING, there is one more thing: the cover is designed so that David's eyes follow you all around the room, no matter where you go. Buy one to play, one to frame, and one for all the people you love in your life. NOW. Did I mention the song "Hot Shot City?" It's particularly good.

The way some people write about these guys, you would think they're the second coming of Neu! or the reincarnation of Kraftwerk. Well, I wish they were. I want to like this CD a lot more than I do, but I've had it for a few months and not played it more than a couple of times. The music is just too static. Even with Neu! or Kraftwerk, who these guys obviously show a debt to, the music evolves and there are little details that jump out at you on repeated listenings. On this CD, though, what you hear is pretty much what you get. It seems a lot more detailed and intricate than it really is. There are some appealing things on here and some good ideas, but they are not explored in enough depth to make this a really essential recording. It does make good background music, but if I wanted good background music, I have Eno's ambient recordings for that. Overall I found it disappointing after all the hype I had heard about this band.

As much as I love Gong, I can't recommend this. It's really a collection of odds and ends, many of them very poorly recorded indeed. When I say &quot;odds and ends,&quot; I really mean it; for example, the version of &quot;Tried So Hard&quot; here sounds as if it was recorded by a cassette off a television speaker. And do you really need re-recordings of the little gnome voice saying &quot;Gong! La planete gong!&quot; from the beginning of Camembert Electrique?Unless you're an absolute fanatic who must have every beep and bleep Gong recorded, you can probably live without this. I've had this for a number of years and I don't listen to it that often at all.

Not quite as demented as &quot;Tago Mago&quot; or &quot;Monster Movie,&quot; this is the album that made them stars in Germany. It's largely a continuation of the ideas pioneered in &quot;Tago Mago,&quot; where the band was layering manifold drum rhythms intercut with sparse guitar buzzes, eerie keyboard effects, and ultra-minimalist bass throbs. All is topped off by the incomprehensible but compelling vocals of Damo Suzuki. And like &quot;Tago Mago,&quot; this is still a good 20 years ahead of its time, and has been stolen from by myriad artists who have taken credit for innovations that were not theirs. Can deserve to be far more well known than they are. Find out where your fave alternative artists REALLY stole their licks from, and get your brain massaged in the bargain. Buy this CD.

If this doesn't win all kinds of blues awards, I want to know why.Precious Bryant is the genuine article; she lives in a trailer in Georgia, and this CD was recorded in the living room of a friend's house. Nothing but her voice and her guitar.That's all there needs to be. Precious is a dynamic, adept guitarist; she sounds like two players all by herself. Her fingerpicking is precise and funky and motivates right along. It's probably some of the sharpest solo blues playing I've heard in a while.Her voice is as good as her guitar playing. She has a conversational, sly delivery, and even on the more &quot;down&quot; numbers it seems there must be a grin and a wink behind it all.This is happy blues from a woman who is completely disinterested in commerciality. The whole recording has an &quot;out on my front porch with a little glass of whiskey&quot; feel. Precious Bryant just wants to have a good time playing music and make sure you have a good time listening to it. She succeeds.I would recommend this recording to absolutely everybody. The only people who wouldn't like this CD would be people who would be too crabby and mean to enjoy it anyway, and who cares what they think? You, on the other hand, need some Precious in your life.

If possible, this record contains even less energy and personality than the previous YLT CD's combined. Not a single song stands out or stays in your head any longer than it takes to play the CD. You've heard this all before, somewhere else, from bands that did it better.The eternal question with Yo La Tengo is: How many times can you rewrite the Velvets' &quot;I'm Sticking With You?&quot; The answer: As many times as your record company (and your fans) let you get away with.I tried. I gave Yo La Tengo four CD's worth of my money, and out of those four CD's I only kept one. This is the one that hit Ebay first. Draw your own conclusions.

On this 1993 release, Our Favorite Grrlz from Osaka take on more of a rockish stance and get a little grimy. The production is stripped down like a hot rod and ready to race, with no superfluous overdubs. Shonen Knife still wear their influences on their sleeves, those being 70s power pop, Ramones and British Invasion groups. However, all those influences are whirled through the Shonen blender and thus we come out with bubblegrunge songs about concrete animals in the park, drinking so much tomato juice that you turn into Tomato Head, and searching for a good Italian restaurant that offers mushrooms with the spaghetti. We also get a plea to save the trees and a portrait of a cat getting high off catnip, as well as the just plain pretty &quot;Another Day,&quot; which sounds something like if the Beach Boys were Beach Girls and they were from Osaka and met the Shangri-Las. Sort of. In short, another confusing and wonderful slice of life from Shonen Knife, coming from a place a little sideways from our reality, but no less appealing for all that.

At the time this was issued, Miles seemed definitely afraid of being left behind. Not that he would ever admit it. He'd been listening to Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone, among other things, and had obviously realized that the time he had spent putting down and/or ignoring late period John Coltrane and Albert Ayler was dangerously wasted. Jazz had moved past him at an alarming rate and he was trying to catch up. He did all his catching up in one fell swoop, on this album. Miles dealt with electricity and free jazz all at the same time.That's what scared, and still scares, a lot of people away from this album. Miles jumped headlong into the future, or what he thought was the future. His listeners, who still long for &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; or at the very outside, &quot;In A Silent Way,&quot; were dismayed and outraged. Miles, famously, did not care.In retrospect, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; may not sound as revolutionary as it once did. The music is obviously a series of jams edited together with varying degrees of success. There is honestly not much difference between &quot;Pharoah's Dance&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; harmonically, and both of them go on too long with no clear direction. There are moments of inspiration, but honestly very few of them have to do with Miles' playing; the interaction between the various members of the band provides the enlightenment, as it would in almost all Miles Davis recordings beyond this point. Together the two songs are an interesting exercise in piling diminished and minor chords on top of one another, and trying to solo over same, but overall it's an experiment at best.The second CD is much better than the first, with more coherence and direction both harmonically and improvisationally. Miles plays better on this disc, and so does everyone else. Again, it's hard to really tell the compositions apart, but at least this time it's not because of harmonic sameness. The songs begin and end fairly arbitrarily, which would be appropriate for a project that basically consists of jams edited together.&quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is not as innovative as many people believe it to be. What happened here was that Miles Davis, a major jazzman, dived headlong into electric jazz and free jazz after ignoring both for far too long. His fans and listeners at the time were as far behind the times as he was, and therefore were either shocked to death or hailed this as an act of &quot;genius.&quot; The truth is that it's neither shocking, nor genius; it was a canny move by Davis, and brought him back into a music scene that was beginning to forget who he was. It also provided him with the opportunity to explore electronic and free sounds. And you can never rule out that at least some of Miles' motive was to make people mad; he enjoyed infuriating people and going against their expectations, and at this point, Miles was saddled with more expectations than most jazz artists. This was a great way to alienate the bop dinosaurs and stuffy nosed critics once and for all, which would take the weight of tradition off his back and allow him to move forward.The only trouble was, Miles himself was not sure of where he should go after this, and after a lot of rehashes and misdirections, ended his career hiring Sting to play on his albums and covering Cyndi Lauper tunes.All that out of the way, Bitches Brew is pretty essential for exploratory jazzers, especially the second CD. I personally think that Miles' live CD, &quot;Dark Magus,&quot; is much more representative of the sound he was trying to make here. It's equally formless but more focused and more fierce. As it stands, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is an important recording, and maybe an essential one, but don't make more out of it than it is.I also have to mention that there are surprising musical similarities between the music on this album and the music of a German band, Can. Can were playing live at the same time Davis was, and I wonder sometimes listening to this if Miles encountered Can on one of his many tours of Europe. Perhaps; perhaps not. But listening to this and listening to Can's &quot;Tago Mago&quot; back to back might cause you to sit back and think a bit.

Hideous mishmash of linguistics, hypnosis and pseudo-psychology written by two college students in the 1960s who had no experience or degreed work in any of the mental health sciences, and both of whom engaged in conduct that is very possibly unethical, both at the time of the book's publication in the 1960's and subsequently. Bandler, in particular, has had a checkered career that the reader should research before investing in this book, or in any of the "ideas" that comprise NLP.The book consists of a series of self-invented formulas that use bits and pieces of linguistics and psychology to present "concepts" that were already laid out clearly by other authors years before. The book uses these pseudo-scientific diagrams and many unnecessarily complex, wordy explanations in order to (a) confuse the reader and (b) impress the easily impressionable as to how intelligent they are.This book belongs in the same category as L. Ron Hubbard's books on Scientology or Werner Erhard's "EST." Bandler and Grinder based this book on their observations (which were apparently not very good) of Milton Erickson's psychotherapeutic techniques, which are outlined in much more comprehensible detail in other books. This book, however, is hogwash.

This is one of the few CD's that I just have no hesitation giving five stars to. &quot;Gravikords, Whirlies &amp; Pyrophones&quot; is a recording of people playing unusual and home-made musical instruments, performing familiar and utterly alien-sounding compositions on them. If you have any ear at all for music this CD will keep you fascinated for days, and reading about the artists in the accompanying book is equally entrancing.A great many books and recordings of experimental musical instruments are painfully dry and boring, written (and recorded) from an academic point of view. This book/CD set isn't, and as a result it's highly entertaining. I can guarantee that as a listener you have never heard anything quite like the sounds you will hear on this disc. And far from being a collection of funny noises, all of the pieces on here are compositions, with beginnings, middles and ends, actual rhythms, and melodies. This CD/book set is an eye-opener and a mind opener, and it's very inspirational. It made me want to go out to the garage, fire up a bandsaw and make my own instruments.And I will guarantee you that nobody can keep a straight face during the rendition of &quot;New York, New York&quot; on the Car Horn Organ.

This is probably the best place for neophytes to Sun Ra to start. It contains music that is both reasonably &quot;in&quot; and completely &quot;out,&quot; and the extraterrestrial &quot;Space is the Place&quot; is both dissonant and catchy simultaneously. The band is inspired and inspiring, with &quot;Images&quot; and &quot;Discipline&quot; sounding something like Duke Ellington if Duke had been from Alpha Centauri. &quot;Sea of Sounds&quot; is a sound sculpture that can't exactly be described; it must really be experienced. &quot;Rocket Number 9&quot; is an oddity that closes off the album in a not-so-serious way, dropping you back down to earth after the extended space excursions of the other tracks. This is music that is absolutely great to listen to with your eyes closed; it invites your imagination to conjure up all kinds of imagery. In spite of the fact that this is very much oriented towards free jazz, there is a great deal of structure here; it's just not obvious structure. Even more importantly, there is a warmth and a communal joviality in this music that is missing from a lot of free and avant-garde jazz, a sense of play and amusement that makes &quot;Space Is The Place&quot; a lot more accessible than most free/avant jazz allows itself to be. Highly recommended for either the advanced space traveller or those still contemplating boarding Rocket #9.

...This is a fantastic movie. There are indeed slow parts, but the movie makes up for it with the cinematography. The look of the movie is fabulous. The performances are terrific, if sometimes limited by the script, and the amount of story material it had to cover in a relatively brief time. I cannot think of better casting choices. Juliana Margulies is ravishingly beautiful and yet brings a dignity and grace to her role, Joan Allen is appropriately malignant, and Anjelica Huston, well, I was won over by the time she was riding with young Morgaine and explaining to her, "The Goddess is everywhere..." Wicca 101 on primetime TV!Forget the nitpickers, folks. This is a WONDERFUL movie. Pick it up.

I am a big prog nerd and a big Crimson fan. But the stuff here (one would be hard pressed to call it music) is an unending continuous racket that will induce nothing but a pounding headache in the listener within a very few minutes. Calling it "aimless noodling" would be unnecessarily kind. Avoid this at all costs, even if you are a fan of the recent Crimson. I can listen to Albert Ayler and Sun Ra at their most extreme, but this dreadful mess is totally irrelevant to any kind of "music" whatsoever. [...]I've been a Fripp/Crimson fan for many, many years and believe him to be an absolute genius, but this CD is totally unlistenable earsplitting racket.

Crowley's work has little to do with &quot;hating God&quot; or &quot;being your own god&quot; or &quot;the whirling of the electric void,&quot; etc., etc. This is a book of mystic poetry, allegedly dictated to Crowley by a supernatural being of some sort. Like much of Crowley's work, there is sublime beauty here, interspersed with sheer nonsense and the man's obnoxious egotism. However, it is the basis for a great deal of magickal thought and theory. Crowley was obviously a man of insight, and, it must be said, a great magickian, but he was hampered by his need for attention and his addictive nature. All those qualities are here displayed in this book, which is why it draws its share of demented worshippers as well as wise people who can objectively study it to discern his insights. And make no mistake; the book does take study, and thought. It is worth reading, especially for the student of occult thought, but remember to take your extra-large grain of salt with you at all times when venturing into Crowleyland. That being said, the Invocation of Nuit is purely beautiful. Aggravating but profoundly enlightening.

Now, perhaps, Neu will get the recognition they deserved for so long. The legitimate reissue of these absolutely essential albums on CD will surprise many listeners, because they prove without question that Rother and Dinger virtually invented much of what passes for &quot;new wave,&quot; punk, and ambient/new age.Regardless of this, what is the Neu! sound? On this, their first album, it's largely the manically driven, pulsing drumming of Klaus Dinger that anchors everything, while Michael Rother plays guitars and synths. But this is only the primary element of their sound; over the top of this Rother and Dinger overlaid numerous instruments and noises, aided not a little by producer Conny Plank.It is a bit dismissive of Dinger to state that he &quot;only&quot; played drums; he played a number of instruments, including what he claims is an electric banjo on the bizarre, Sonic-Youth like track, &quot;Negativland.&quot; Rother, for his part, is often simplistically dismissed as the &quot;softer&quot; member of the group, but in several places on this first disc he demonstrates a very aggressive guitar style and a willingness to play with sound and noise that belies that claim.The music is not dated at all and is still mostly without parallel, even in today's music scene. The driving rhythms overlaid with sound effects, guitar and bass, create an atmosphere where every song is as much experienced as listened to. From the opening thrust of &quot;Hallogallo&quot; to the final creepy whispers of &quot;Lieber Honig,&quot; this is a CD that every serious rock fan needs to listen to. And listen to repeatedly; it reveals more on subsequent listens.There are a lot of albums that are called &quot;classic,&quot; and there is a lot of hype flowing these days about so-called &quot;Krautrock,&quot; but Neu!, like their contemporaries Faust and Can, live up to their legend. Definitive, worthwhile, and necessary.

From the first howled notes of "Old Dan Tucker," a song that nobody over the age of four cares (or should care) about, to the end, this is Springsteen's crassest yet. He simultaneously taps into the "O Brother Where Art Thou" soundtrack crowd and continues the fake-populist stance he's taken since "The Rising," an album that did nothing but crassly capitalize on the 9/11 disaster in order to bring back what was frankly a failing career.Seeger's name stuck on this album is especially insulting. The songs have little to do with Seeger, and Seeger always had the courage of his convictions. Springsteen, on the other hand, has shown that he's perfectly willing to fake a populist stance in order to reap the financial rewards and renew his career.I used to like and respect Springsteen. No more. This is the bottom of the barrel, and shows that in the long run he's no more principled or worthy of notice than any wanna-be abusing a cover song on American Idol.

It's sad to look at what REM became on this album, a disappointing follow-up to the equally disappointing &quot;Monster.&quot; Again, no melodies to speak of, badly constructed songs, and most pathetic of all, attempts at hip-hop moves that sound white-boy, wanna-be inauthentic. &quot;Monster&quot; proved that REM isn't a punk band; &quot;New Adventures&quot; proves that they can't be a modern &quot;funky&quot; down-wit-it band, either. What happened to just being yourself, Michael?I half suspect that Bill Berry didn't really have an aneurysm; he just heard the final mix on this album and decided to get out before it got any worse. Finally, this album is TOO LONG. They didn't write enough music to fill up the time, but then again they barely managed to write any songs at all on this one. For a long-time REM fan like me, this is a bitter pill to swallow, and I didn't.

Thoroughly daffy Japanese punk-pop from the only punk-pop band doing anything interesting. This is mainly a re-recording of some of their early singles with the lyrics translated into English, and for old-time fans the updated sound may throw you off. But the better production helps them, and the insanely catchy songs and bubblepunk riffing overcomes any and all initial resistance. For newcomers to the world of Shonen Knife this is a pretty good introduction. Fans of Green Day, the Ramones and the Beatles will find common ground here. How many bands can you say that about? Of course inspirational lyrics about massive consumption of candy and the wisdom of saving the buffalo from extinction (despite its ugliness) don't hurt anything either. Peace, Love and Shonen Knife!

Willie Dixon was a great songwriter. He is quite often overrated as a performer because of the quality of his songs, and this recording, like all his solo recordings, shows exactly why he was a great songwriter - but not a great singer or performer.Dixon's voice, never much to begin with, is strained here, but he manages a conversational delivery that almost works. I say almost because some of these songs, particularly the old ones that he reworks here, would require a much more impassioned delivery than he was capable of to make them work.The production is clear, but the instrumentation and arrangements are acoustic, and midtempo/slow songs abound. The &quot;new&quot; numbers on this album sound alike and break no new ground in any sense.There's a reason this CD is out of print. I gave it three stars out of respect for Dixon's accomplishments in the field of Chicago blues (not Delta blues, people; totally different genre) and for the musicians' contributions. But in all honesty, if you went your entire life without hearing this CD, you wouldn't be missing a whole lot. I've owned it from the time of the first issue on vinyl and I haven't played it more than a half-dozen times.Willie Dixon's songs were best performed by other people, particularly Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Buddy Guy. This recording, sad to say, is definitive proof of that.

This was shot on the cheap, and some of the acting is hammy, as other reviewers have pointed out. But it is indeed atmospheric, and occasionally genuinely creepy-looking.The person who makes this interesting, though, is William Schallert as the villain, Dr. Mears. You may not know him by name, but you've seen him on TV a million times.Schallert has spent much of his career playing genial, inoffensive storekeepers, friendly pipe-smoking dads, wise uncles, nice grandpas, etc. on things like the Patty Duke Show, Dobie Gillis, Matlock, and Highway to Heaven.Here, he does a really bang-up job playing against his usual character. He's a creepy, neurotic, wormy, indecisive, snivelling villain, the total opposite of the usual frenzied Mad Scientist types in science fiction flicks of this era. He's said to have done something awful &quot;during the War,&quot; but it's never specified exactly what, which actually makes him more creepy. His evil plot is not to &quot;take over the world,&quot; but to use alien tech to make himself a billionaire!He also sports longer hair than most people were allowed in the 1950s (outside of Bible epics), plus a very Beatnik-looking mustache and goatee! One gets the impression that he goes back to his room in the Professor's house and plots using alien tech to take over the stock market while listening to Charlie Parker and Lester Young.This is definitely not the best science fiction flick ever, but it really deserves your attention. The director and the actors do a lot with what they have to work with. One wonders what this movie would have been like if someone had been able to get some serious financial support behind it; with the right budget and a little script rewriting, &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; might have had some serious competition in the &quot;brainy sci-fi movie&quot; department.As it stands, Man from Planet X is a cool little movie. Get it and enjoy.

Aside from the novelty hit "New Age Girl," there is absolutely nothing on here worth hearing twice. Not quite rude enough to be punk, not quite smooth enough to be pop, a sort of lukewarm neither-nor 90's "alternative" act. Like most New Orleans rock bands, they have no definitive identity, and lapse into near-parodic regurgitations of their influences throughout. Probably best filed under "Where Are They Now?" ... Only for people who are strangely nostalgic for the mid-90's.

A bunch of people, none of whom are terribly famous or very good at what they do, get together to knock off yet another Cleopatra Records &quot;tribute album&quot; to a multiplatinum group.Cleopatra Records, which has done more than its share already to molest the Pink Floyd legacy (their wretched &quot;best of Syd Barrett&quot; cd still reeks), tries to cash in once more by repackaging a previous release of Pink Floyd covers. The original, I believe, was a 2 disc set, which didn't sell. I suppose the reasoning was if they trimmed it down to a 1 disc collection, somebody who's a fan of one of these groups might buy it.Give yourself a break and pass on this sadness, and let these folks (and Cleopatra Records) lapse into the obscurity they deserve.

I like Belle &amp; Sebastian in spite of myself. I realize their flaws but at their best (as on &quot;Boy With The Arab Strap&quot;) they fill a niche that no other band can, and do it with wit and style.Unfortunately almost all of that wit and style are missing here. To sum up, the Stuart Murdoch songs on here are pretty good, if very gloomy; not his best but certainly not throwaways. The problem with the Murdoch songs is that they sound a lot like Belle &amp; Sebastian &quot;doing&quot; Belle &amp; Sebastian. That is, there's a certain amount of self-referential, unintentionally self-parodic stuff going on. The lyrics are not as sharp and witty and in some cases the new songs sound like old ones. &quot;Nice Day For A Sulk,&quot; in particular, is simply a rewrite of &quot;The Boy With The Arab Strap&quot; slowed down with different lyrics. In short, the Murdoch songs are acceptable but not great.The songs by the other band members, on the other hand, are largely awful. The guy with the groaning, tuneless voice and the labored classical guitar who does &quot;Beyond the Sunrise&quot; should immediately take up accountancy, BECAUSE I NEVER WANT TO HEAR HIM SING AGAIN. EVER. The Isobel-sung songs are hampered by her voice, which is frankly quite weak, and &quot;Family Tree&quot; is too wispy even to be called twee. It dissolves into inanity before it even reaches your ears. I may be in the minority but I think the band will get along fine without Isobel Campbell.Overall this album is a real disappointment. It's scattered, unfocused, has at least one truly awful song that never should have been recorded, and even the best material on here is not up to the standards of their earlier work. Don't make this your first Belle &amp; Sebastian purchase, and even if you are a fan, give this one a wide pass.

It was 1970. Nothing had changed, as the hippies hoped it had. The sweetness of Woodstock had been killed by Altamont. The Left in the U.S. and U.K. was dissolving in confusion and anarchy. Genial, all-for-one rock bands had been replaced by ugly, egotistical Rock Stars. The Beatles broke up, and they broke up ugly. Charles Manson was on trial and the hideous details of what he had done were being revealed every day on the news worldwide. Nixon was in office, and Kent State showed that there were quite a few people who wanted the hippies dead. The war was not only still going on, but getting worse; The My Lai Massacre occurred in 1970. The gentle drowsiness of pot and the mind expansion of LSD had been replaced by the nasty jitter of cocaine. The dream, as Lennon announced, was over.Into the void came Black Sabbath. Their music had nothing to do with hippie idealism and everything to do with 1970 and its illness. They were blunt, unrefined, and powerful. There was also an emotionally scarred feeling to the music and lyrics. They hoped for love and peace in the same way a drowning man going down for the third time hopes for a life raft. And they sounded, overall, just plain evil. They weren't, of course; in actuality they were just four guys from Birmingham, a run-down steel town in England with a lot of struggling middle-class people. But they sounded evil, with Iommi's detuned guitar and his preference for slow-motion, ominous riffage, Bill Ward's heavy, but finessed drumming, and Geezer Butler's active, fist-hard bass. And then there was Ozzy. &quot;First it was the bomb, napalm, vietnam, disillusioning,&quot; he sings in &quot;Hand of Doom,&quot; stating the whole theme of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; album.This is an album about disillusion, disintegration, fear, and anger. It's basically someone reacting to the world around them with shock, and retaliating the only way they know how; with music that reflects what's around them. That is why &quot;Paranoid&quot; is one of the classic rock albums. As long as the world remains a place where innocence is violated and dreams fall to ashes, &quot;Paranoid&quot; will express the feelings of those who watch in horror and feel the need to do something, anything, to exorcise their fear. The War Pigs are still out there and they're still out for power.

&quot;India's Master Musician&quot; is a showcase for Shankar at his fiery best. Like other reviewers have commented, if you buy this CD for meditation purposes or as background music you're going to be severely disappointed, because on this CD, to use a bit of guitarist slang, Ravi &quot;shreds&quot; unapologetically. He obviously is in control of his instrument here and wants to show it. Yet he does so without sacrificing taste and style.This would be a great CD to introduce someone to Indian classical music. And strange as it may sound, anyone who is a fan of jam bands or jazz improvisation should immediately connect to this. The music here, although coming from only three instruments, shows a lot of pure energy but is also quite subtle. You can listen to this and get something out of it on a lot of levels.I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in exploring Indian music, or Ravi Shankar, for the first time. The (relatively) short pieces combined with the high energy level and the excellence of performance make for a must-have recording for anyone.

Recorded when most of the band was high and/or in jail, TSMR is understandably kind of a mess. The press jumped on it with both feet at the time and declared it awful, as did many of the less progressive fans of the band at the time. However, I think this was a necessary stage in the development of the Stones and really one of their more experimental albums. Many people cite the Beatles as an influence on here, but the overdriven and hyper-reverbed chords that open &quot;Citadel&quot; sound like pure Syd Barrett to me, and &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; also seems more than a little influenced by the Madcap from Cambridge to these ears. And if you pretend &quot;2000 Man&quot; is on a Kinks album, say &quot;Something Else By The Kinks,&quot; it's an interesting exercise. But who knows? I always wondered if the whole album wasn't a little bit of a parody of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; instead of an attempt to make their own version.What is true is that there's very little of the scroungey rock rebels of the first albums here. Poor old Brian Jones puts in a terrific performance here, adding all kinds of instrumental flourishes. It's his creepy mellotron and electronics that turn &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; into what it is, and his use of &quot;non-rock&quot; instruments (especially on the underrated &quot;Gomper&quot;) helps make the album sonically quite intriguing.Granted that Bill Wyman's &quot;In Another Land&quot; is awful, but it's comically awful. And in any case he's forgiven, because on the rest of the album his bass playing is phenomenal.The standout tracks, as others have said, are &quot;Citadel,&quot; &quot;She's a Rainbow,&quot; &quot;2000 Man,&quot; and &quot;2000 Light Years from Home.&quot; But overall, this is really worth spending time with. None of it is as awful as the Stones' fans (and the Stones themselves, apparently) believe it is, and there are more than a few genuinely interesting musical moments.Lyrically, underneath the psych gloss, you can definitely hear a bunch of scared young men thinking about the trouble they're in and being a bit paranoid about it. &quot;Citadel&quot; in particular stands out in this respect, with the acid-edged imaginings about confinement in steel towers and Jagger's uncharacteristic pleading, &quot;Please come see me in the Citadel.&quot; Is he speaking from his futuristic city? or from a jail cell? (Which was a real possibility for both he and Richards at the time.)In any case, it was an experiment for the Stones, and overall it didn't seem to work for them. This was partly because of how the album went against their &quot;image,&quot; and partly because they were not as skilled at psychedelia as the Who, the Beatles or Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd. But I still think this is a very worthy album and I find it very addictive in its own strange way. But make up your own mind, give it a fair shot, and I think you will find a lot to like here.

It's hard to believe that this album was scrapped. A lot of bands put out albums that were much worse than this. One has to wonder if Paul Rothschild should have just taken a few valiums and put this out at the time it was recorded, because this is very, very good.This is a terrific document of a band of seriously dedicated guys playing the music they love, as authentically as they can. These guys weren't kidding; they paid their dues on the South Side of Chicago and were accepted as peers by none other than Muddy Waters. The performances here are raw but not sloppy, and the band is as tight as a tick. Most of the songs on here are played at a quick clip, but there's a lot of bite and venom in these performances, an air of urgency not dissimilar to something you hear on Buddy Guy's early recordings.It's sad to think that the Yardbirds got so much praise (and still do) as being white interpreters of the blues, when this collection shows clearly that the Butterfield Blues Band was much, much better than anything the British blues movement would offer for several years. Why the Yardbirds got the press and historical props and the Butterfield Blues Band doesn't is a total mystery. Maybe they didn't wear enough paisley.There is no paisley or patchouli on this one. It's just hard, tough blues, nasty, with teeth in it. Forget that half the band was white guys and dump every preconception you have about hippies, white blues, etc., and listen to this for what it is; a seriously cool recording of a very hot band hitting their stride.Finally, I want to add that the recording quality of this album is not &quot;execrable.&quot; It sounds every bit as good as any other album recorded in 1964 (! ) and a whole lot better than most. As a matter of fact, I think this is a much better produced record than anything the Yardbirds ever did. It's certainly much more authentic blues. A great document of an unjustly forgotten group.

This, the Softs' first legitimately released album, was recorded on the cheap during the band's tour of the US, when they were the opening act for Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix's manager Chas Chandler got them some studio time, and the band set up and recorded their live set right there in the studio. Despite "producer credits" the band more or less produced it themselves, which explains the occasionally raggedy sound.Now, here's what you should be paying attention to. Robert Wyatt's singing and drumming, totally unlike anyone else's in rock, full of energy and finesse. Kevin Ayers' eccentric bass playing and songwriting. And last but not least, Mike Ratledge's distorted, fierce organ playing. The band somehow combines whimsical English prog with vicious electronic experimentation, with a very strong free jazz influence.There are more "songs" per se here than on subsequent Softs albums, and they are outstanding. Wyatt's "Hope for Happiness" opens the CD with a free-floating vocal improvisation and then slams into a frenetic meditation on fighting despair, interrupted only by Ayers' milky-ocean bass meditation "Joy of a Toy" before slamming back into "Hope" and finishing up with a freaked-out organ finale. "Why Am I So Short?" finds Wyatt poking fun of himself, his ego, and the level of pop stardom he enjoyed, which segues into the deranged "So Boot If At All," a keyboard-based improv that sounds even more radical than what Keith Emerson was doing with the Nice at the time. "A Certain Kind" adds an almost neoclassical note and features a truly lovely Wyatt vocal."Save Yourself" is a song that dated from the early days of the band when Daevid Allen was involved with the group, and is much more jazzy than the version on "Jet-Propelled Photographs." Everything flows into one vibrant, ever-changing movement after that, with high points being Ayers' odd, almost proto-punk "We Did It Again" and the crown jewel "Why Are We Sleeping?"It was all pretty eye-opening in its day and still is now. Soft Machine later degenerated into a rather boring jazz fusion group after Wyatt and Ayers left, taking their eccentric senses of humor with them. But this is the Soft Machine at its best, in my opinion, and not to be missed.CD Nerd Info: The One Way CD seems to have been taken from a vinyl master and offers no significant improvements over the vinyl. There also seems to be a vocal track missing from "Hope for Happiness," when I compare this CD with my original vinyl version. However, the rest of the CD seems intact and the sound is decent, so if the One Way release is the only one you can find, go with it. But I suspect the twofer CD "Soft Machine Vol 1 and 2" might be a better buy. In any format it's highly recommended for the adventurous listener.

I have a confession to make. I'm 40 years old and my wife bought this for me for my birthday because I love animation, and because Roger Ebert spoke well of it in his reviews. My wife and Roger Ebert were not wrong. I sat spellbound for the whole film. There is so much to like about this film that it is hard to know where to begin praising it. The animation is exquisite, with attention to tiny details in every scene. The characters are believable and appealing. The American voice actors are exactly right for the parts they play, in particular the late Phil Hartman as JiJi the cat and Janeane Garofalo as the artist Ursula. Of course Kirsten Dunst voices Kiki exactly the right way. The storyline is as strong as the animation, and this video will reward multiple viewings on all levels. Note the details in the animation, as in the dust blowing off the street when Kiki takes off, or Kiki using her feet to bounce her off buildings when she tries her unsteady flying skills. Pay attention to Ursula, the independent, strong and yet kind female artist, who manages to be a great character and a terrific role model, as is Kiki herself, capturing the experience of being 13 without cloying sentimentalism or straining the imagination. Look at the town she settles in and note the details of this mix of all the cities in the world. Wiccans and pagans can also note that this video presents a very positive view of witchcraft and witches, unlike so many other movies that attempt to deal with magic. The storyline is involving and compelling, and oddly enough, quite realistic in the way the characters interact and express themselves. No matter whether you're 4, 14, 24, or 40, this is an unqualifiedly great movie and a masterful work of the animator's art. I would recommend this movie without hesitation to anyone. Any movie that has both witches and zeppelins in it can't go wrong with me, but I know that this movie will appeal to anyone with heart and imagination.

First of all, this writer's real name is Dario Salas Sommer and he's from Chile. He claims to have knowledge of the secret teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, an ancient Egyptian mystic. Interestingly enough, there is another John Baines, an Englishman, who is REALLY an Egyptologist, but has nothing to do with these books. That's not a good sign.The second thing that should make you lift an eyebrow is the fact that Mr. Salas is a bit of a cottage industry in his native Chile and elsewhere, as the Founder and Spiritual Master of the Dario Salas Institute For Spiritual Science. Which undoubtedly you can gain enlightenment from. For the right amount of money, of course.There is nothing in this book that cannot be discovered in other, older, and more legitimate works. The material in this book that isn't in other older works is not worth reading, because Mr. Salas has MADE IT UP out of whole cloth.Give this one a pass. Try The Kybalion, by &quot;The Three Initiates&quot; instead.

This is a review of the entire series.I cannot fault Robin Hobb as a writer of characters. There are a number of characters in the Liveship series, and almost all of them are fleshed out. It is easy to identify with, sympathize with, and hate the characters; some, like Kennitt, you can do all at the same time.However, this is one of the downfalls of the book. There are too many characters, and even though they are well drawn, their purpose is not necessarily always clear. There are some characters who exist only to provide further obstacles to an already obstacle-ridden series. After a few hundred pages, I found myself thinking, "What, something ELSE is going wrong with Wintrow's (or Althea's, or Paragon's, or Kennitt's, or Malta's, etc.) life?!?" As a result some of the characters become annoying rather quickly, like Davad Restart, whose death comes as a relief because any time he shows up in the book, something awful is about to happen. Grag Tenira is fleshed out and made sympathetic only to be used as a lovelorn sap. What was the point? The protagonists had enough to deal with already!It also became hard to distinguish the villains from one another. Page after page of depraved slavers, rotten shipmates, bad first or second mates, evil merchants, etc., etc., blurred together, and the sheer volume of them almost became inadvertently funny. "Look, a slave owner," I thought to myself. "I wonder how many paragraphs it'll be before he does something depraved or wicked! Ah, a first mate, wonder how long before he beats up (molests, brands, scars, attempts to murder) someone?"There were also subplots that were frankly completely aimless and annoying. I cared not in the least about the sea serpents. It would have been enough to use up a chapter to establish that they were sentient and that they were searching for something. Having the "tangle of serpents" have the same conversation, over and over and over, for agonizing page upon page, was too much. After a certain point I began to skim, or even skip, the serpent chapters entirely. They really weren't interesting, especially not when compared with the storyline involving Kennitt, or the storyline involving the Vestrits and Vivacia.This is a series that needed to be severely edited, and I mean severely. There is, if anything, too much detail and too many characters. When the writing gets into a rhythm, when the characterizations and plotlines of one story arc really begin to gel and draw me in - that was the exact point where Hobb would derail the flow and go into another dreadful sea serpent dialogue, or spend endless pages describing the details of someone's dress or someone's heraldic insignia or a society ball, or some other piece of florid and ultimately insignificant detailing. Hobb did it well, mind you. The distractions and details are well written. But there are far too many of them and in the long run they damage the overall storyline by pulling the reader away from characters they care about and preoccupying them with minutiae.I have to admit that at several times during the series, I started to skim and even to skip chapters. In short, I got bored. I am not a person with a short attention span and I have waded through some immense books, but there were parts of the series that were just unbearably long and tiresome.This could have been several good individual novels. The story of Kennitt, Emma and Wintrow could have stood on its own as a separate volume, as could the story of the Vestrits. The plot about Brashen Trell and Althea eventually became histrionic, but I guess it could have made a decent fantasy/romance. And the sea serpents that turned into dragons - well, I could have lived my whole life without reading yet another fantasy novel involving dragons. Dragons are one of the more played-out conventions in the fantasy genre, and unlike other reviewers I found nothing particularly enlightening or interesting about the way Hobb handled this overworked and over-written-about mythical beast.Overall I wanted to like this series. There were times when it was exciting and engaging, and then...another miserable sea serpent dialogue, or another 10 pages with the spoiled Satrap emphasizing what a horrible, horrible, horrible person he was. And wait, in another 100 pages, you'll get to stop the storyline you're loving and get *another* chapter detailing what a dreadful, awful person the Satrap is! (Did I mention that the Satrap is really a horrible, depraved person? Well, don't worry, another 100 pages will *really* convince you! But first you have to have your required dosage of 50 pages of Waterlogged Reptilian Angst.)To sum up, this could and should have been three separate novels with ONE storyline each. Then perhaps a fourth book to draw all the threads together. As it is, the Liveship books are not epic, as they would like to be, but simply unwieldy and cluttered, and ultimately more aggravating than satisfying.It's hard not to say enough good about Hobb's ability to make great characters, but it's difficult to find anything good about the shambolic tangle of plot that she inflicted on these great characters.

It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about trucking. This is real honky-tonk country music. There's no airbrushing, no poofy hair, no designer cowboy hats, no rewritten 70s California folk rock songs passing themselves off as &quot;country.&quot; Wussies who dig Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, and other such pale milkweeds are advised to stay away; this stuff will be too strong for your blood. This is country as it was meant to be. Songs about women, coffee, and truckin', dang it. As completely honest and out-of-style as Dale's hair-tonic endowed haircut and the tattoo of the state of Texas on his arm.If you're sick of these poseurs with their fake fluffy pop passing themselves off as &quot;country,&quot; climb into the cab with Dale, fire up, and get rollin', friend. It'll do your heart good.

I'll preface this by saying that I am a Pagan. I was definitely hoping for a lot from this book, and I was sorely disappointed.To be honest, most of the stories are thoroughly mediocre, and some are purely abominable. Maggie Shayne's "Anytown, USA," which starts the book, is an example. "Anytown" is almost frightening in its adherence to cliche and histrionics. A minister's wife, who of course is physically and mentally abused by her husband (Rotten Men! Rotten Christians! Now everybody: Boo, hiss!) finds her inner strength and faces down a town full of nasty ole rotten witch-haters at a school chorus festival. Shayne lets no point remain anything less than obvious, and hammers each moral lesson home with a verve betraying her background writing scripts for soap operas. I almost stopped reading the book after this first story.The second and third stories were not much better: a half-written, half-plotted cyberpunk object, and a "Love Story" based tearjerker almost made me throw the book out again. Charlotte Brisbon's "Psyche's Tears" was better; at least there was something going on that seemed semi-realistic, and the characters were actually fleshed out. "The Spelling Error" by Jen Sokoloski is nothing more than a romance, but a good one. "Tambourine Moon," by Zelena Winters, was a significant step above the rest, with its depiction of a Gypsy mother trying to reconcile with her daughters. I'm not sure how to take Celia Moon's "The Letter," which is more about marriage, family, betrayal and healing than anything else. I can't say it's one of my favorites, but again, the characterization is good, and the message, for once, is not bluntly hammered home. It still reminds me too much of the stories I used to read in my mother's "Woman's Day" magazines. Valerie Taylor's "The Reluctant Psychic," seems incomplete; the story needs a larger treatment. As it stands, it's fine, but it seems quite incomplete. "A Solitary Path," by Evelyn Vaughn, is quite good. Witty and fanciful yet realistic, her Tobi is a character I liked and would follow into a novel. Rosemary Edghill's "The Iron Bride" is the bright spot in the book; an acerbic mini-mystery that is less about witchcraft and murder than it is about power and responsibility. Definitely the shining light in this collection.Overall, this collection suffers from several flaws. One is the excessively preachy tone taken by several of the stories. Second is the political correctness angle; men in these stories are either (a) absent, (b) Evil, or at best untrustworthy, or (c) dying. Third: most of these stories are romances in one form or another. Looking at the author profiles in the back of the book, I note that many of them make their living writing romance novels. Too much of their daytime work leaked over into the stories they wrote here, and not always with good effect. I find it hard to believe that the editor could not have found authors who write outside the romance genre to contribute to this book. I also wonder why no male authors were included.In summary, this is not an indispensable book. If you like your fiction heavily on the romantic side and don't expect too much, this book is...acceptable. But if you're looking for some real literature about modern-day witches and how they live and work in real life, this isn't going to work for you. It definitely didn't work for me.

Dreadful patched-together thing, assembled from a Russian movie which was cut up to include el-cheapo Roger Corman style sequences featuring Faith Domergue (who appears almost comatose) and Basil Rathbone (who leans on things a lot). The rest of the cast is Russian, and the rest of the movie is dubbed, very clumsily indeed. The film has an overall reddish tinge (outer space is inexplicably fire engine red) and the DVD was mastered from a really terrible film copy. The plot points are horribly obvious, the special effects are garbagey, and the film moves at a glacially slow pace. I can only imagine what it was like before Corman cut it to its current length!That being said, the robot IS cool, as is the air-car. The vision of Venus is hilarious, especially considering what we know now, and the idea of calling the robot &quot;Robot John&quot; and addressing him as if he were a particularly stupid child is peculiar to say the least.Overall this is pretty dang awful. I like bad movies but...this might just be irredeemable. If the MST 3K crew were still working, this would be perfect fodder for them, and with a sufficient amount of beer and three witty friends, you might be able to have a fun evening. But there are much better bad movies out there than this one to make fun of.

Like all of Rand's books, &quot;Anthem&quot; is loaded down with her self-created &quot;philosophy.&quot; Fortunately for those of us not suffering from insomnia, you can actually read this book without falling stone cold asleep in the middle of chapter two. This isn't because it's such a great book; it's because it's so painfully simple and transparent you could almost have written it yourself. If you will, this is her &quot;Cat In The Hat,&quot; but where Dr. Seuss wanted to get kids to read, Rand here wants to get people who are ignorant of her &quot;philosophy&quot; to agree with it. It's less a work of science fiction than it is a religious tract for her cult.There is nothing in this book that is new, original, or particularly interesting. It stands mostly as a classic example of Cold War paranoia, comparable to J. Edgar Hoover's books on how to fight those dirty godless Reds at home or McCarthy's radio and TV interviews about how the &quot;Communist menace&quot; has infiltrated society.The best thing that can be said about this is that unlike &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; or &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; it is blessedly brief, and Rand's sentences, paragraphs, and plotlines don't become as ridiculously murky as in her other works. But that's pretty much all you can say about this book.I find it interesting that the only people who seem to take this book seriously are Rand cultists and heavy metal band drummers who write bad concept albums about the book (see Rush's &quot;2112&quot; for details).In the final analysis, &quot;Anthem&quot; is a quaint artifact of Cold War paranoia, and nothing more.

Genuinely mysterious and absorbing, this is one of the more striking works to come out of the &quot;psychedelic&quot; sixties. On many of the songs, Buffy teamed up with Peter Schickele (yes, P.D.Q. Bach in his other life!) on songs that featured primitive but effective electronic experimentation. &quot;God is Alive, Magic is Afoot,&quot; is one example, as BSM sings across/over an eerie musical backdrop that the listener gradually comes to recognize is a heavily treated recording of her singing the same song. In spite of the experimentation, it's spine-chilling and beautiful.At the same time, Sainte-Marie kept her folk roots and her social consciousness intact. The voice-and-acoustic &quot;Suffer the Little Children,&quot; with its commentary on capitalism, would not sound out of place on her earlier albums, and the downright sensuous &quot;Guess Who I Saw In Paris&quot; is one of her best love songs.The real fascination here, though, is how far afield Buffy goes. In &quot;Keeper of the Fire&quot; she provides a Jorma Kaukonen like guitar solo with her voice on the ride-out, and &quot;Poppies&quot; is outrageously trippy and far ahead of its time, reminding the listener of an early version of Enya or Loreena McKennitt.The album was not a commercial success in its day, primarily because it was so &quot;out of character&quot; for what Buffy's fans wanted. But thirty-odd years later it still sounds subversive and strange. The album combines Buffy Sainte-Marie's natural warmth and power with eerie and transcendent moments quite unlike anything else out there at the time (or now). Very much a lost classic, &quot;Illuminations&quot; is not just for folkies. Anyone with an interest in psychedelia or the unusual will find a lot to like here. One of her best and well worth having.

I have to approach this from a musical standpoint, since I'm a musician and not a belly dancer. (And a good thing too, who wants to see a 40 year old bald guy belly dance?)Musically, what we have here is a fusion between Arabic music and more modern sounds. Ramzy uses traditional instruments along with the occasional synth and drum machine. At first I was bothered by the occasional intrusion of the synthesizer and the drum machines, but then as the music progressed I forgot they were there. Ramzy wants to introduce the modern elements, but he's pretty firm on keeping the Arabic element upfront. For the most part, this works, and it's quite possible to get caught up in it. He is a fantastic drummer, and all the musicians on here are more than competent.I have to admit this doesn't attain quite the high level of spirituality and sensuality that more traditional Arabic music does, at least not for me, although &quot;Aazab&quot; comes very close. However, I'm not sure that's what Ramzy was aiming for. It seems that he's trying to bring Arabic music to a wider audience, as well as providing killer soundtracks for bellydancers everywhere, and in that he succeeded.I personally wish the production was a bit less...perfect, I suppose, and that the musicians had gotten a little more carried away and a little less careful. There is a wildness that's essential to a lot of Arabic music that appeals deeply to me, and Ramzy only occasionally hits that wildness here.But it's quite possible I'm expecting too much from this CD. It's also true, in spite of all I have said, that I listen to it and I like it, and find something to dig every time. So perhaps it would be best to ignore my reservations and listen to it for yourself. After all, whose opinion are you gonna take; mine, or the 40,000 or so gorgeous bellydancers who love Ramzy's music? I thought so. Me too.

Take a song that should never have been tampered with. Turn it over to idiots who make &quot;music&quot; by chopping up bits of other people's songs and calling the stuck-together mess their own. Glaze it with a lot of techno-trickery that's going to sound painfully dated in five years, no, make that two months. Release it to the public, and put the resulting money into Mick and Keith's already overstuffed bank accounts.I would say something about how utterly crass this proves the modern-day Stones to be, that they would allow one of their best songs to be ravaged and prostituted this way. But I think we all know now that what's left of the Rolling Stones is nothing but a corporate touring machine.This is sad.Don't you have something better to do with your money, your time, and your ears?

Mostly acoustic, and surprising, versions of familiar songs here. Bolan is playing live on American radio. At this point he was in the odd position of being a total superstar overseas, but a complete unknown in the USA. As a result he is at his most charming and (for the most part) unpretentious. He runs through what were then non-album tracks (which would be a total no-no for an &quot;unknown&quot; artist in today's &quot;music industry&quot;), explains that &quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; is about reincarnation, and plays slashing, efficiently rocking acoustic guitar. It's altogether engaging.On the second CD, Bolan straps on an electric guitar and is accompanied by the rest of T. Rex on &quot;Elemental Child,&quot; &quot;Jewel,&quot; and &quot;Hot Love.&quot; &quot;Jewel&quot; gets a bit excessive, but again, Bolan's enthusiasm and love of just plain rockin' out save the day. The CD ends with some ragged-but-right recordings that include a very unexpected version of Carl Perkins' &quot;Honey Don't,&quot; and an early version of &quot;Get it On,&quot; called &quot;Get It On Blues,&quot; which contains some classic doesn't-make-sense-but-somehow-does Bolanesque lyrics.(I should remark that on both CD's, the first 2/3rds of the material sounds great, but the last third is rough sounding. Understandable, considering all of the source material is live American radio broadcasts from the early '70s.)This CD is something that you'll definitely want in your collection if you're a Marc Bolan/T. Rex fan, and it's fascinating to hear this side of Marc. It might surprise people who are only familiar with &quot;Get it On&quot; and the currently popular &quot;20th Century Boy,&quot; to hear Marc get down on acoustic, but Spaceball shows that Marc had a lot of music in him, and could get it across on a stage in front of jillions of screaming fans or sitting with his beat up Epiphone acoustic in front of a hippie radio station's microphone. Worth listening to.

Many claim that this book was channeled from a spiritual entity, or entities. It may well have been, or not; in her introduction to the book, Fortune states with admirable honesty that she doesn't know if it was channeled or if it came from her subconscious on overdrive. She does lean toward the &quot;channeled&quot; theory.I am sorry to say that, although I am a student of the occult, I find much of this book incomprehensible. This does not invalidate the worth of the book; perhaps I'm not &quot;ready&quot; for what it offers, or perhaps it would only make sense to someone who was involved in the same magickal tradition that Dion Fortune was involved in.In any case I can say for sure that this book is not for the casual student of the occult, nor is it even for the average person who reads Dion Fortune's works and learns from them. To be honest, this book mystifies me completely, although I have to admire the thoroughness with which Fortune and/or the Entities create their cosmology and the apparent &quot;rightness&quot; of some of the more comprehensible statements in the book. That is what the three stars are for.However, I have to be honest and say that I don't understand what she's getting at (or what the Entities are getting at) here, and I seriously doubt the general reader will either. Nonetheless its cryptic nature makes it an interesting curiosity, and perhaps much more than that to those more adept than I in Dion Fortune's tradition.

Lou Reed's career has as many low points as high ones. This is one of the lowest. Bland, anonymous studio musician rock with lyrics that are so over-the-top that they become unintentionally funny. Eventually, though, even the humor factor wears off and it quickly becomes unlistenable.The scam, at the time this came out, was that this was REALLY Lou Reed - no, REALLY, the REAL Lou Reed, talking about his REAL life. Really! Honest! Of course anyone who believed that would also want to invest in Lou's shares in the Brooklyn Bridge or his offering of great real estate in South Florida.The best thing about this album is the cover. Nothing else on here is worth bothering with. Most of Lou's output on Arista records showed him at his least interesting, and this one unfortunately is one of the worst (only surpassed by the truly abysmal "The Bells," which no one should be forced to listen to).God bless Lou Reed, but give this one a pass.

Commercial and overproduced, Renaissance's last album is not their best moment. It seemed to bear little resemblance to the neoclassical group that did "Scheherazade" and "Ashes are Burning." The sound is very 80's, digital, and dated, and the songs sound like leftovers from the Motels or any of the subpar synthpop bands of the decade. Annie Haslam's voice is the only thing of note here, and it's wasted on these dreadful songs. You would be better advised to buy any of their first four albums to hear them at their best.

This is an excellent book for any student of mythology, and in particular Northern mythology. But it should be said here that this is simply "Gods and Myths of Northern Europe," retitled and in hardback instead of paperback.The book, of course, is fascinating. Davidson was very knowledgeable, but more than this she was a good writer, and this is not a dry text. It is not simply a retelling of the Norse myths, either; Davidson explores the possible meanings and purposes of the Northern beliefs, comparing what was known at the time from archaeological studies with the rare written materials which have come down to us. She notes wisely that much of what we have on the Northern religions comes from those who were observers or from those who were hostile to the "heathen" religions, and carefully pares out what can be known from speculation or romanticization.In its time this was a very influential text, and unlike many older historical reviews it still conveys a lot of good information in a very readable manner. It is highly recomomended for any student of mythology and the Northern mysteries.

Ame Son were one of the first progressive/psychedelic bands in France. Most members of the band played with Daevid Allen of Gong after Allen was denied entrance to England due to visa problems, which basically ended Daevid's tour of duty with Soft Machine. When Allen was with them, they were known as Bananamoon, and after Allen's departure to form Gong, they renamed themselves Ame Son.The music on "Catalyse" is very much like a cross between early Gong and "Jet Propelled" era Soft Machine. The shorthand explanation would be psychedelic improv-jam rock with jazzy overtones provided by the flute of Francois Garrel, while guitarist Bernard Lavielle provides appropriately fuzzed-out bliss. Vocals are rough but in most cases mercifully brief.The music is rewarding and inventive, but the recording quality distracts somewhat. Recording quality is about what you would expect for an album of this time and place; American and British musicians in the 1960's had trouble getting recording engineers and producers to understand their visions, and the troubles were tenfold for French and other European psych/prog rockers. Spalax's typically lackadaisical CD "remastering" does not help much in this regard either. To give you a point of reference, the production quality is about the same as it is on 13th Floor Elevators albums.If you can get past the rough recording quality, "Catalyse" is a bit of a jewel in the rough for Gong fans and for anyone who likes psychedelia. Ame Son was important in the history of French rock for being one of the first bands who broke out of the three-minute pop song ghetto, and deserve attention on that basis. Not a masterpiece, but not bad either; it takes a few listens to understand what's going on, but overall it's worth it.

The late John Campbell tried hard. Nearly killed by an auto accident in his teens, he began learning blues guitar during his recovery. He was plagued by a heart condition that killed him in 1993, cutting short a career that was gaining ground at the time of his death.Campbell could be a strong songwriter and performer, and there are times on all of his records when this cuts through and you hear the raw, real element that comprised the talent of the man. However, he weighed himself down with a deliberate assumption of a "Hoodoo man with a hellhound on my trail" stance, and all too often the songs and the image approached a kind of parody of the "tortured bluesman."His voice, in particular, betrayed this. Campbell seldom sang in his natural range, forcing his voice into an unnatural attempt at a Howlin' Wolf growl that often sounded strained and a bit pretentious. His music, more often than not, relied heavily on Lightnin' Hopkins' influence, to the extent that he even played the same kind of guitar with the same kind of pickup that Hopkins did, not to mention using many of the same riffs and turnarounds. A further failing was that underneath the blues affectations, Campbell seemed to have learned more from rock versions of the blues than the real artists themselves. His version of "When the Levee Breaks" sounds nothing like the original Memphis Minnie song, but is lifted lock, stock and barrel from Led Zeppelin's version. The problem here is that Campbell was not as good a guitarist as Jimmy Page, or even Memphis Minnie; the attempt comes off as ham-handed, an embarrassing exercise a lot like listening to a white college student stumbling through his versions of the blues at a local coffeehouse. His version of "Saddle Up My Pony" is similarly Zeppelinized. And the world did not need another version of Tom Waits' "Down in the Hole." Particularly misguided was Campbell's decision to try and sing like Tom Waits, which meant that we're listening to a white man who tried to sing like a black man, trying to sing a song like another white man who tries to sing like a black man. At that point the inadvertent self-parody becomes almost too great to bear.The originals do not fare much better. Campbell loads the lyrics down with cliche'd images of playing cards with the devil, hoodoo, voodoo, being "evil," dogs fighting in the street, guns, whiskey, bad women, and whatever other cartoon versions of the blues he could dredge up, all accompanied by music that is more or less lifted from Lightnin' Hopkins (and as mentioned before, Led Zep and other 70s rockers).Campbell was at his best when he wrote more honestly and without cliche, as on "One Believer," the previous album to this one. As a performer he could be powerful and purposeful, and almost lived up to the legend he tried to create around himself. But "Howlin' Mercy" is not his best album or his best work. Here, he fell into too many cliches, both of his own making and those of others. But frustratingly, even on this record, here and there his genuine talent shines through.If Campbell had lived longer, he might have been able to shake off the ghosts of his influences, which limited his voice and choked his talent. As it stands, Campbell is a perfect example of the white bluesman trying too hard to step into the shoes of giants, and falling short despite his best efforts.

Basically this is a lot of stuff tossed into one big pot and stewed together. There's no apparent logic to the selection, and some of the sources are a bit dubious; on the first CD in particular I hear vinyl noise, and the recording quality varies, sometimes from song to song.BUT...there is some awful good stuff on here, and at a very hard-to-beat price for three CD's that are around an hour each. There's no way to tell when this stuff was recorded; I suspect it was from the 50's and 60s, when John Lee would basically record for anybody who fronted him some cash. As a result some of these recordings have a real guerilla blues, down-home sound.The first CD mostly consists of John Lee by himself, his big ole foot slamming into the floor, his distorted, honking, blaring guitar, and him growling, singing, mumbling and sometimes shouting over the ensuing racket. This is John Lee at his most primitive. The sound is raw, but if you aren't used to raw-sounding blues recordings by now you shouldn't even be listening to the blues. The recordings are generally clear; it just sounds rude, crude, and vicious. About 3/4 of the way through the first disc a band consisting of snare drum, bass and piano begins to accompany him. Some of these recordings are pretty trashy, but for the most part they work.The second disc is John Lee with a band. John Lee is not easy to play music with because he tends to turn a 12-bar blues into a 13, 16, or 9-bar blues at will. The unnamed band accompanying him doesn't sound bad at all, but occasionally they have to scramble to keep up with John. Still, they connect with John more often than not and rock out. There are some strong songs and performances on this disc, and some lesser-known songs that will be interesting to blues scholars.The third disc is definitely from the early 60s and features John Lee with a band again. It seems like the band is a little bit better connected with him than on the 2nd disc. It almost sounds like most of the material is from the same session as the second disc. No way to tell, because there are no liner notes. On the inside of the box is a small 2-page insert which basically gives you the names of the songs on each disc and a couple of pictures of John Lee from the late 50s or early 60s wielding an Epiphone electric.Overall I would say this CD is worth having. It's not expensive and there's a ton of material on here, and most of it is of good quality. More importantly, the performances from John are strong throughout.Fans of cleaned-up, sanitized, digitized blues will not be happy with this, but for people who regularly listen to imitators like Jon Spencer, here is the real, rough, crude, barfightin', low down dirty article. The two missing stars are for the absolute lack of sequencing and the total absence of liner notes/musician credits. The three stars are for the fact that it's a big fat hunk of John Lee Hooker's music at a dirt cheap price, and the performances are definitely worth buying this for.

There was a book my wife wanted once called &quot;Murder in America.&quot; It had stories about infamous murders and pictures to go with them, mostly crime scene photos which left nothing to the imagination. I could not help but read this book even though it made me shudder and feel filthy, somehow.I feel the same way about this album. It's weirdly compelling. Cave's histrionics (and he is quite histrionic, let no one deceive you) are not as grating as I expected, but leavened with large doses of very black humor, and some lyrics that will not leave your skull no matter how hard you try to scrub them out. He is a good songwriter and a great singer, acrid and uncompromising in his approach. On a lot of the songs here there is a sense that he is almost compelled to write and sing these songs by something within himself that he cannot quite understand, and that fascinates me to no end.This is my first exposure to Nick Cave; it will certainly not be my last.

This is a hard CD to review. On the one hand, if this was all I knew of Freddie King, I'd say it was very good. On the other hand, if you know of his recordings for King/Federal, this definitely pales in comparison.The songs are largely covers, which is strange as King showed himself, in his earlier recordings, capable of writing blues classics all on his own. Some kind of hilarious cover-tune nadir is reached when they take John Fogerty's country tune, "Lodi," and turn it into a fast shuffle. Freddie insists on singing, "Stuck in Lowdown again," instead of Lodi, thus accounting for the song title "Lowdown in Lodi."Another minus: the instrumentation and recording reeks of the 1970s; no reverb, flat drum sounds and (shudder) strings a' la' B.B. King's "The Thrill is Gone" on some songs. Leon Russell made sure his keyboards were right up there in the mix, too; not so much that they overwhelm Freddie King's guitar and vocals, but he's definitely trying to prove he's there.Another drawback is the 70's funk touches on some tunes, which make it sound like Freddie's trying to encroach on Albert King's 70's territory. The problem is that the musicians here aren't terribly funky. Albert had Stax's house band when he went toward the funky blues, where Freddie here has to contend with guys who sound like they would be more at home on a J.J. Cale record.Overall it's really shocking how much this resembles an Eric Clapton record from the 1970s. If you were to find someone who had never heard of Freddie King, and play this album and any one of Clapton's mid-70's albums back to back, they might be forgiven for thinking it was all the same guy.But...Freddie King performs magnificently. His vocals are in top form and his guitar playing is stellar. I feel like a curmudgeon for even pointing out the flaws in this, simply because none of the blame for the flaws lands on Freddie. He does what he does best, which is sing and play guitar like an angel.So, let's sum up: this is not as vital or as essential as Freddie King's recordings for King/Federal records, not by a long shot. But if you prefer your blues on the rock & roll side, are fond of mid-70's Eric Clapton, or are curious to hear how Freddie King evolved/devolved (according to your opinion) during his Shelter Records period, this would be a good choice, because it would be a lot easier to get through this than the original three albums that this is drawn from.This may well be the best of the Shelter Records years, but don't confuse it for the best of Freddie King. That title goes to CD's like "Let's Hide Away And Dance Away," and "Freddie King Sings," both of which you should get before you invest in this.But, again, Freddie King is in top form vocally and instrumentally here, so it's a very hard call. Anyone who is a Freddie King fan, but hesitates to invest in his flawed later work would probably find this CD to be all they would need of his music from the 70's. And those who fell in love with Freddie during his nonstop tours with rock stars in the 1970s will dig this deeply. I would still recommend the King/Federal work over this, but "The Best Of The Shelter Years" still has its strong points.

This book might -- MIGHT -- be of use to the beginner or the casual practitioner, but anyone who has been involved in paganism or wicca for any length of time will not find much here that hasn't been covered elsewhere. And, I am sorry to say, covered in more depth. The illustrations are nice, though, and for someone who is not very familiar with wicca or paganism this might be helpful, but ONLY as a start down the path. If you're further on down the Way, there's not much of any interest here, sad to say. And what is it with Llewellyn and spelling errors? This book is loaded down with them. People, Microsoft Word includes a spellcheck function - USE IT.

The Alchemysts, in spite of what you may read in the editorial review, are a pretty mundane and dated-sounding post-rock band with more of a New Wave sound than a 60's influenced sound. Think early U2, Wire, etc., but with more thrashing and far less imagination. Their vocalist basically just shouts his way through the songs, and the songs, such as they are, are pretty much indistinguishable from one another.Simeon (of Silver Apples fame, if you can use the word &quot;fame&quot; in relation to the Silver Apples) layers analog electronics over what the band is playing. Unfortunately, the sounds he makes (which seem to range only from &quot;bloop&quot; to &quot;bleep&quot; in tonal variety) have nothing at all to do with the &quot;songs.&quot; He just seems to start making weird noises after the band starts, and quits playing when they quit, with no apparent regard for what the band is doing. Not that the Alchemysts are doing anything interesting to begin with.Overall this was a thoroughly disappointing CD. It's monotonous, irritating, and ultimately boring. I am no stranger to electronic music or psychedelic music, nor do I have anything against mixing heavy rock with analog electronics (see my Hawkwind reviews), but this stuff just doesn't cut it. It's not even remotely mind-expanding or innovative. I can think of about a hundred obscure psych gems you should get instead of this one. Give this a pass.

This is Amon Duul II's masterpiece. Furiously molten guitar playing, weird and disturbing vocals, roaring chaos contrasted with fragile delicacy, naivete bouncing against cynicism, overlaid with a glitter of lysergic glamour and undergirded with a humanity and heartfulness their American and English counterparts could not muster. Possibly the greatest psychedelic rock band of all time; certainly the greatest psychedelic rock record of all time. I am not kidding. On a par with Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd and the post &quot;Priest Driven Ambulance&quot; Flaming Lips.

Less lysergic but most lovely album, with Renate Knaup's vocals making their presence known, and the band working to make a slightly more &quot;accessible&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; sound. Of course it was neither, but as a result the compositions are more organized and only hover a bit above the ground, as opposed to previous albums where they were bound for distant reaches of the universe. A good introduction to Amon Duul II, and a nice in-between stop for Duulians who have already taken the big mystical interstellar journeys, i.e. &quot;Yeti,&quot; &quot;Phallus Dei,&quot; and &quot;Tanz Der Lemminge&quot; with them.

This is a decent hard-bop blowing session, but Jackie McLean's sax work is what's outstanding here, and that only occasionally. For a session recorded in 1965 this sounds awfully dated in comparison to what other trumpeters, say Don Cherry and Miles Davis, were doing at the same time. Don't get me wrong, it's a good quality hard bop record, but it's not anywhere near a &quot;jazz classic.&quot; The original liner notes, from the original 1980 (? ) release, are positively some of the worst liner notes I have ever read in my life, obsequious, snide, and insulting. If you buy this - and if you like hard bop, you might want to - just IGNORE the dreadful liner notes. Don't even bother taking the insert out of the CD case. To me this recording sounds terribly commercial and not all that exciting. It is unfortunate to note that this 1965 date sounds exactly like a brand new record from the Wynton Marsalis &quot;Nothing After Bird&quot; retro-camp, which says more about the lack of imagination of today's jazz artists, and isn't meant as a slight on Morgan, McLean, and company. At least when they recorded this, it was semi-hip.

Now that Mr. Hawkins has departed this plane of existence, we can only rely on recorded evidence that such a being existed. &quot;Cow Fingers &amp; Mosquito Pie&quot; is enough evidence of strangeness to provide Scully and Mulder with hundreds of years' worth of investigation material. From the original and alternate takes of &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; to the final screams of &quot;Alligator Wine,&quot; this is indeed a stunning trip through the mad mind of Screamin' Jay. Dare to experience the completely politically incorrect version of &quot;I Love Paris&quot;! Thrill to the eye-destroying sight of the &quot;Yellow Coat&quot;! (&quot;what stands on two legs and looks like a goat/It's Screamin' Jay in that Yellow Coat! &quot;) Bang your gong to &quot;Hong Kong&quot;! The only thing this lacks to make it perfect are the immoral, I mean, immortal, &quot;Constipation Blues&quot; and &quot;Feast of the Mau Mau,&quot; but those are available on Rhino's excellent &quot;Voodoo Jive&quot; Screamin' Jay compilation. Pick this up and dig Jay's take on country-western music with his thoroughly ill version of Gene Autry's &quot;Take Me Back To My Boots And Saddle.&quot; Sounds like his horse probably has six legs and three eyes. Truly essential mind-destroying early rock/R&amp;B, and a fitting tribute to the man without whom Marilyn Manson (and every other shock rocker) would be playing &quot;Lady of Spain&quot; on the accordion.

Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer are utterly brilliant. This movie is actually about the soul's journey after death - Blake's death represented by &quot;leaving Cleveland,&quot; the mundane world or life as we know it, and entering a kind of Hell (the town of Machine) where the Devil (Mitchum as Dickinson) rejects him. Like Dante he picks up a Virgil-type guide, Gary Farmer as Nobody (read the real William Blake's poems sometime and look for the Nobody reference) who guides him through hell, defending him from the other damned souls who wish to consume him, until he can pass through the ocean of light to...where? Brilliant, brilliant movie.

At the time this came out it was pretty startling. Nobody played keyboards like Keith Emerson and his virtuosity, then as now, was astounding. And then, as now, the way he uses that virtuosity is highly questionable.This album is hard to listen to. "Grating" would probably be a good way to describe the whole CD, to be honest. The songs are not good, and that's being kind. Most of them are clumsily constructed, and were undoubtedly designed to showcase Emerson's keyboard skills. Lame psychedelic cliche conglomerations suddenly crash into exotic keyboard forays that sound like (no surprise) Emerson Lake and Palmer, which with no grace morph back into inept psychedelia. Most songs bludgeon you with needlessly extended endings that become inadvertently funny.Another thing that makes this difficult to listen to is the fact that Emerson is obviously the most accomplished musician on the record. The other bandmembers [do not play very well]; there were American garage bands (The Electric Prunes come to mind) who had better command of their instruments than Lee Jackson, David O'List and Brian Davison. They can't keep up with Emerson, and it shows. David O'List's vocals and guitar playing, in particular, are spectacularly bad.The whole thing seems like a keyboard-oriented, psych/prog version of Spinal Tap - only they were apparently serious. Even the cover is forebodingly awful, four ugly guys apparently naked and wrapped in gauze, simpering up at the ceiling.Overall, "The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack," is of absolutely no interest to anybody except historians and Keith Emerson completists, and I will bet that there are some of those who wouldn't have this in their house. You probably shouldn't either.

Not one of the best ones. The production on this is very strange, with odd dropouts in volume throughout. This makes listening difficult, especially since nothing on here is really loud. Or fast. The tempo is medium and the volume is low, and quite honestly, it tends to drag.The song choice is disappointing, too: I mean, really, &quot;Careless Love&quot; and &quot;John Brown's Body&quot;? There was absolutely no reason to record these mummified old folksongs, which are both best left forgotten - in these versions or any other.There seems to be a big lack of energy here on Jimmy's part. Quentin Warren and Donald Bailey are on top of things, but Jimmy seems to be thinking of his new Verve contract and the big bands he'd be working with over there. But whatever he was thinking about, it sure wasn't this session.Overall, I'd say don't get it. There's some decent music on here but it's very disappointing by comparison to his other albums. If you're looking for an intro to Jimmy Smith, &quot;The Sermon&quot; is it. I'd recommend this only to completists.

Messaien wrote &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot; in a Nazi prison camp. This work was first performed by half-starved prisoners on broken instruments, to an audience of arrogant Nazi prison camp guards and officials, and the people they had enslaved in the name of the Third Reich.The work that Messaien composed in the face of this titanic evil was not a work of anger or bitterness. It was not a work of resignation to an inevitable fate or a hymn to depression. Messaien chose to represent, musically, the end of all things, as described in the Book of Revelations in the Bible. In its austerity and its serenity, the Quartet informs the Nazis: You are in control now, in this place, at this time, but your control is not absolute. Your Reich will not last 1000 years. You may attempt whatever you like and kill millions, but your time will be done, and you will be banished to nothingness.Messaien hid his message behind the context of the Book of Revelations, which he interpreted not in the fashion of modern day &quot;born again&quot; fundamentalists, but in a mystical way, as a spiritual event that had resonance in his time. What was Hitler but an Anti-Christ, a beast attempting to set himself up as a God? Messaien called upon the power of the Word and set it to music, a music that was intended to work as a memory of redemption, a reminder that evil cannot, and will not, triumph over good no matter how profound the evil may be. It is also the sound of a man calling on his God to avenge the evil that has overtaken the world. If the Nazis had truly known what Messaien was telling them, they would have shot him.Musically, Messaien was forced to write the Quartet for the instruments he had available to him. He also had to take into account that the instruments were half-broken; for example, the piano that was used in the original performance was missing strings and therefore there were notes that it could not play. Messaien wrote with all this in mind, and with his subject matter in mind.The Quartet is definitely a 20th Century work. Messaien had been writing works outside of the accepted &quot;classical&quot; form for some time, but here he abandons time signatures, uses extreme chromaticism and wide tonal variations, sweeps of dynamic range, and unexpected, perhaps unprecedented, tonalities and atonalities.But he did all this with focus. So many 20th Century composers made music that seemed an academic exercise. Messaien, here, uses every musical expression in his power, every type of music that he knows how to write, every sound that he hears in his head, to write the Quartet for the End of Time, in the service of God and Man and Freedom. This sets the Quartet utterly apart, in my mind, from any other piece of 20th Century classical music, and elevates it to a higher level than nearly any other 20th Century music. Only the musician Albert Ayler would come close to expressing the kind of intense spirituality combined with overwhelming musical technique expressed here.I can only add here that this performance, by these artists, is and has been the definitive performance of the Quartet for the End of Time, and that they bring this music to life with conviction and clarity.It feels cheap and commonplace to tell people that they should &quot;own&quot; this piece of music; it is far too majestic to be &quot;owned&quot; in any sense by anyone. The Quartet for the End of Time is one of the most profound works of art that the human race has ever produced. You should have this, not out of any sense of acquisitiveness or one-upmanship, but because it provides a doorway into the heart of God and the heart of humanity that is nearly unparalleled in the history of music.

I imagine Mr. McLaughlin is not really fond of this record; he probably feels embarrassed about it. It's definitely a product of its time and place (late 60s/early 70s) and the aura of cannabis and lysergic products hovers around it. But it's a lot better than he might think. Many of McLaughlin's fans decry it, but they're off the mark.Sure, it's definitely not anything that resembles his other work. It's not fast and precise like Mahavishnu. It's not particularly Indian-influenced, and it's not really very jazzy. This is more of a Krautrock record than anything else; in many ways it reminds me of German acid-rock bands like Agitation Free or Ash Ra Tempel, who were doing a similar improv-space-rock at about the same time this was recorded.The guitar playing is wonderful. McLaughlin uses a muscular, abrasive tone here that doesn't sound too dissimilar to 70's era Robert Fripp; the reliance on tritones and minor 2nds in the thematic statements doesn't hurt that comparison. The difference comes in McLaughlin's harsher tone and sly choice of notes, which is clearly influenced by late period Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, and other free jazz saxophonists. He plays arcane riffs and abrupt, chromatic melodic lines as though they were perfectly normal acid-rock statements, and it works beautifully. Make sure to pay attention to how he uses the wah pedal.McLaughlin lays back on the blinding speed for most of the CD, preferring to snarl and howl. There is the occasional fiery spray of electricity but nothing as overwhelming (or as frankly excessive) as his Mahavishnu work. The compositions are relatively simple, but they hang together, and the band is consistently with him and responsive to him. Larry Young is great, and Buddy Miles and Billy Rich provide a consistent rock-solid foundation for Young and McLaughlin to freak out over.I'll be truthful - I enjoy this more than I do much of McLaughlin's Mahavishnu work, which sounds somewhat sterile and overbusy in the cold clear light of a new century. "Devotion," on the other hand, has less technical finesse but a lot more guts and expressiveness.In summary, "Devotion" is a CD that any acid-rock or Krautrock fan would love. Jazz fusioneers will definitely have a problem with it, but anyone in the mood for an intelligent guitar freakout will find a lot to like here.

Scooby and the Gang are updated a bit in this one; Fred and Daphne's relationship is not as stereotypical as before, the bellbottoms and ascots are gone, and as other reviewers note, the video makes gentle fun of the whole Scooby-Doo genre. But otherwise, I find that this is classic Scooby-Doo. I didn't find this video to be excessively violent or too scary for kids, especially considering that a lot of kids' animation such as Dragonball Z and Pokemon is a lot more violent and scary than this. I was pleasantly surprised at the positive, though somewhat inaccurate, depiction of Wicca; for example, one need not be an hereditary witch to be Wiccan. However, the overall positive view of Wicca far outweighs the occasional goof on the writers' part. I note that some parents were disturbed by the fact that the movie even mentioned Wicca or witchcraft, which is sad, because it shows we still have a long way to go before true tolerance of non-Christian religion happens in American society. It's sad to think that there are still grown adults who haven't learned the lesson of tolerance that an animated dog already knows. Other than the fact that Tim Curry makes a great villain (like we didn't already know that!) and the fact that some of the monsters are &quot;real,&quot; the remainder of the movie is very much like your typical Scooby-Doo episode, with Shaggy and Scooby goofing around, Velma figuring things out, Fred being the action guy and Daphne pretty much standing around being The Cute Girl. The animation is very fluid and fun to watch, and the supernatural scenes were spooky but not excessively frightening, especially by comparison to the other animated stuff that's out there that's allegedly for &quot;kids.&quot; Scooby-Doo and the Gang are still among the most popular cartoon characters ever, and this video, in spite of the undeservedly negative reviews elsewhere, will please any Scooby fan of any age.

Crowley is a maddening author, full of wisdom and insight and equally full of outrageous lies and obnoxious egotism. This is one of the examples of the latter; it's basically just extremely bad poetry pertaining to his particular teachings, at least the ones he was trumpeting at the time he wrote it. If you want to find out more about Crowley, &quot;Magick Without Tears&quot; and &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; are far more enlightening and inspired than this book, which is quite frankly tripe, and very rank tripe at that.

Take a little Vincent Price, some Little Richard, some Paul Robeson, squeeze the blood out of an alligator and mix it up with some old swamp water in a dirty dish. Thus from the void sprang Screamin' Jay. This Rhino compilation definitely contains much of his best work, although it does lack the completely bizarre &quot;Take Me Back To My Boots And Saddle,&quot; (found on the equally respectable &quot;Cow Fingers &amp; Mosquito Pie&quot; collection). Mr. Hawkins has departed from our plane of existence but from what I can tell, he will have lots of fun in the afterlife. This compilation rocks in a way that makes other 50's rockers - hell, other 90's rockers - look like mere weiners by comparison - weiners that Screamin' Jay could jab a fork into and toast over demonic fires for all eternity. Screamin' Jay was a man among men, one of the true American rock and roll originals, and he will be missed. Buy this now and unhinge your mind for good.

I should say here that I am not a comic book reader on a regular basis.This book took me by surprise. It made me realize what I loved about the Man of Steel when I was six years old and spent every penny I could beg from my dad on buying Superman comics. It made me realize, also, what Superman means to me now, thirty some-odd years later, and how there is still resonance and life for this great literary creation (and I'll back that up with detailed arguments if I have to) all these years since his creation.Superman, here, is a man, and a man of conscience. His greatest power has never been his strength or his speed or his invulnerability. It has always been his conscience, his need to set things right, to save lives, to basically "do the right thing." In "Superman for All Seasons," his humanity and his conscience are brought out and emphasized. It is easy to lose sight of those two attributes, and even DC has lost sight of them before. Not here. They are front and center, for your attention. And you should pay attention.Loeb, Sale and Hanson put Superman/Clark Kent back in his roots, showing his life on the farm, his first love, and the tragedies and triumphs that make him who he is. He is not simply a "big blue boy scout" here. He is a man of conscience, and someone who broods a lot, and someone who doesn't have all the answers. But what he does have, he gives freely, and he does his absolute best at all times. Other readers have commented on the differences between Batman and Superman, but they all come down to this: Batman is motivated by vengeance. Superman is motivated by responsibility. Responsibility is underrated. Vengeance is more sexy, but what quality would you rather have in a fireman?This is a "corny" story. It's about responsibility, and caring for people, and doing the right thing. And yes, there's even a dog. I hate to use the word "values," since it has been co-opted by people who have no interest in the true matters of the heart, but this story has them. It's worth reading if you're six or if you're forty-six, regardless of whether you care about comics or not, simply because it finds the heart - the essence - of this hero, and it reflects the heart of what is good about Superman. And by extension it shows what is good about the society that created Superman as a literary figure.I cannot recommend "Superman for All Seasons" more highly; it is essential for students of American culture, for people who still dream, and for people who want a good story well told.

Terminally underrated band records an album of covers. Which would be unremarkable in itself, but this is the Church. They don't perform the covers so much as insinuate themselves into them until they possess them. Example in point: the opener, "The Faith Healer," which was played pretty broadly by originator Alex Harvey, becomes frankly creepy and strange in the Church's hands. Goffin and King's "The Porpoise Song," is known to most people as a Monkees song. Here, The Church make it an opiated, languorous gem. "It's All Too Much" is entwined with walls of flowing feedback, with added quotes from Eddy Grant's "Electric Avenue" and The Pretty Things' "Sorrow" thrown in over the jam at the end. "Friction" is very faithful to the original. I wish they had made it more their own, but it is a good cover. The same is true of "All the Young Dudes," but on Hawkwind's "Silver Machine" they redeem themselves by attacking the song with abandon. The closer, Neil Young's "Cortez the Killer," is opulent and fierce, replacing Young's ragged wastedness with a disorienting haze that somehow hones the sharpness of the lyrics.Overall a very fine album. "Box of Birds" should not be mentioned in the same sentence with most cover albums. In many ways it stands by itself as a great example of what the Church are capable of.

The irony of Robert Johnson's superstar status is hard to miss. He was almost completely ignored by the music-buying public of his day, even in the market his records were aimed at. Yet in the present day, he's practically the only country blues artist most people know about. On one level, this is because of relentless championing by other blues artists, not least Eric Clapton. On another level, Johnson's fame rests on the fact that he was able to write, or more properly pull together from his various mentors and influences, his songs and make them complete unto themselves. His songs have made an impact, and have been covered time and again by countless artists. That counts for something.Part of who Robert Johnson was as a singer and songwriter is obscured by his legend, which has been retold so often it borders on cliche. But even after the hype has been dismissed, this box set shows Johnson as a powerful, innovative, soulful blues man, a great performer and a great songwriter (in the context of blues songwriting) with his own unique sound.Johnson was not without his influences, and if he had lived he would have told you that himself. However, the interesting thing was that he managed to transform his influences and personalize them into his own vision of the blues, a blues that was one of the first steps away from country blues toward city blues - a vision that would eventually become Chicago blues.It has been fashionable in blues circles to put Robert Johnson down recently, and to gripe about how Johnson's influences should be as well known as he is. This is a valid point. However, Johnson became an influence himself, and as such, he still deserves a good deal of respect. This box set, which contains every recording he is known for, is a just tribute to a brilliant singer, songwriter and performer.The remastering is surprisingly good, considering the sources. Johnson's voice and guitar playing come through vividly and illustrate his wealth of talent. The only possible drawback to this box set, for the casual listener, is the number of alternate takes included. They show that Johnson was an adept performer, because a lot of the alternates are similar to the &quot;released&quot; versions. This showed that he was no closet bluesman or flash-in-the-pan, but was adept at entertaining an audience. And to this day his guitar playing is astonishingly fluid and innovative. However, the repetitiveness of the alternate takes can become trying to people who are not students of the blues, and for the casual listener a single-disc set would probably be sufficient.This box set, is, and remains, a worthy overview of a talent that received its due far too late. I would advise the listener not to be put off by people who would place Johnson's influences over him, but to listen to Johnson on his own merits. My guess is that he'll win you over, as he has generations of listeners.

When I was just a little boy, my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV. From lovable, humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound, no better television show for childhood could be found. Now that I am older, I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV. This Collector's Set Edition, so carefully restored, can once again be purchased, to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew, ages four and six, just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks. I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime. So let's lift a toast to Underdog, a hero for all time, and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme.

The Flamin' Groovies are one of the most overrated bands on the planet. They had a few good songs, but none of them were great, and their albums, like this one, are mostly dutiful, functional rock'n'roll. Lester Bangs and other rock critics in the pre-punk 70s loved the Flamin' Groovies because they were alienated by prog-rock and art-rock. The Groovies sound pretty mundane and uninspired nowadays, but I guess in the 70s people who weren't into pomp-rock were searching for anything that sounded halfway decent. And that pretty much sums up the Flamin' Groovies; halfway decent. If you lived your entire life without hearing the Flamin' Groovies, you wouldn't really miss anything important.I found it interesting that another reviewer compared this band with Big Star. Regardless of the fact that Alex Chilton never did anything good besides Big Star, Big Star were a great band and put out three terrific pop-rock albums, all of which were more inspired and interesting than anything the Flamin' Groovies ever did.

Naoko, Michie and Atsuko once again grace our dismal planet with another communique from Shonen Knife Planet. If you can listen to this CD and not develop a goofy smile on your face, you are certainly completely humorless. Musically there's a little more Cheap Trick influence, and the power-pop moves definitely work for them. This is also the last CD to feature bassist Michie Nakatani, who has decided to retire from the Knife, and she acquits herself admirably with the songs she contributes here. For the uninitiated this is a good place to start, and the Shonen Knife fan will already have this. Pure power-punk-pop that outdistances even such practitioners as Green Day and the Groovie Goolies, and you can't argue with lyrics about sending postcards and drinking hot chocolate. Not to mention the song about waking up with fish eyes and having everyone ask you about your &quot;new views.&quot; Totally zany and fun. Bang your head to &quot;Konnichiwa&quot; and you will know the true meaning of &quot;rock out.&quot;

This isn't an &quot;official&quot; release. This is a release from Dave Anderson, who played bass on one, count 'em, one Hawkwind record; In Search Of Space. (And there are some people who dispute that; the bass on ISOS sounds a lot like Lemmy to me.) This is some kind of tape of the band he got from somewhere, and is not approved by anybody legitimately in Hawkwind. Anderson is quite a card, apparently; he was with Amon Duul II for one whole album also, and created a band in England in the late 70s/early 80s which he called &quot;Amon Duul,&quot; even though he was only in the band for one record. As a result, the members of Amon Duul had to reunite and put out a record to avoid Anderson laying claim to the name. So as we can see, this is a pretty questionable recording, both sonically - and morally. Hawkwind has gotten hosed enough; don't buy this record. Have to admit that the record has a cool title though.

&quot;Tiger By The Tail&quot; is one of the best country albums of the '60s, and maybe of all time. Unlike a lot of country albums from that period, it's not just a collection of singles and their B-sides. &quot;Tiger&quot; works as an album consistently all the way through, exploring a variety of moods and sounds without straying too far from Buck's solid country roots.There are almost too many good things about &quot;Tiger&quot; to list. The instrumental and vocal contributions from everyone are top notch. The Buckaroos never overplay and they never underplay, and all the nights on the road playing together had honed them into what was nearly the perfect country band of the era.Don Rich, the unsung hero of the Buckaroos, really shines here. He takes lead vocals on a couple of songs and does a great job, and his lead guitar and fiddle work are classic. Buck used to tell Don Rich that he ought to go solo, but he consistently refused. Rich died in a car accident in 1972, and his quality musicianship here leaves us all to wonder what might have happened if he'd taken Buck's advice and tried it on his own. Nearly anyone who's a serious guitarist could pick up some cool moves from Rich's playing.Buck himself is in great form here. His vocals are sincere and direct, and his harmonizing with Don Rich (and with himself, through the then-miracle of overdubbing) is pristine without being antiseptic. Buck has a quality of heartfulness in his singing that makes every song sound like he absolutely means it. That quality is all over this record.If you like country music at all you'll want this CD. If you like guitar playing, you need to hear Don and Buck play lead. If you like good songs, there are lots of them here. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this CD.

A pretty motley collection of singles that Merrell Fankhauser was involved with in some way, stuck together in one package and called by the name of one of his bands. This could have just as easily (and more truthfully) been called &quot;Merrell and the Exiles,&quot; or &quot;Merrell: The Early Years.&quot;Overall this is a very disjointed sounding record; production values vary widely from song to song, which is to be expected, because the songs were recorded at widely different times from one another, in different studios, and even with different bands.That in itself doesn't account for the two star review; what really sinks this record is the general awfulness of the songs. The songs are mostly a mishmash of every popular 60's band you ever heard of, with very little musical innovation. The lyrics are absolutely horrible, loaded down with cliches' and easy rhymes, and all about &quot;girls.&quot;There were any number of bands across the United States who were writing songs like this in the 1960s, and they disappeared into obscurity. These songs are no better, and by comparison with many of the garage bands playing at the same time, Fapardokly a/k/a Merrell and the Exiles don't really come off any better. On some songs, they come off considerably worse by comparison. But most of the songs are amazingly average, pleasant enough but completely derivative and unmemorable. There are no &quot;Pushin' Too Hards&quot; or &quot;I Had Too Much To Dream Last Nights&quot; hidden here. Just very average (and sometimes not even that) singing and playing on some very average songs. The liner notes and photos of the bands verge on Spinal Tap territory.This recording makes me wonder, frankly, what the big fuss over Merrell Fankhauser's music is all about. There's very little here that would make me come back to this CD to listen to it again. Painfully average.

This CD has absolutely nothing to do with any current trend in rock and roll music. For the most part it sounds as though it came from some alternate universe where Canterbury rock (early Soft Machine, Caravan, Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers, Gong) never died out. GZM is compared to Zappa by many critics, but that comparison is inaccurate; they're straight out of Ye Olde Canterbury School of Prog Rock, only their songs are shorter. Even on the relatively straightforward &quot;Poodle Rockin'&quot; (which sounds something like early Roxy Music) they manage to insert a Robert Wyatt-esque dog-howl intro. You see? I have to go back twenty years just to find analogues for this band's sound. Not that they're retro; no slavish Beatles imitations a la Oasis. Tremendously melodic, sometimes with two or three melodies within a song, each one a melody that a lesser band would die for; expert musicianship that is never too showy; and insightful yet peculiar lyrics - all this goes in to making up the indescribable package that is &quot;Spanish Dance Troupe.&quot; You really need to have this. No, REALLY.

The first CD in this 2-cd set is quite rough to get through. Smith's tone is extra-gooey and lacks some of the muscularity and grit he would adopt on later releases, and the fact that the first CD mostly consists of slow ballads and sappy standards (really, isn't it time to retire &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; and &quot;I Can't Give You Anything But Love,&quot; from the jazz songbook?) doesn't help at all, at all. Except for &quot;Walkin',&quot; there's really not much to recommend the first CD unless you really like hearing Jimmy Smith as an excessively plummy, occasionally semi-Monkish balladeer.The second CD, on the other hand, is a different story. Jimmy hits the ground running with &quot;Indiana,&quot; and never lets up. Guitarist Eddie McFadden has a lot to do with the pace and the verve of the second CD. He pushes Smith and spars with him, and as a result drummer Donald Bailey begins to get inspired. They start interacting, and it becomes jazz, as opposed to the first CD which is just Jimmy Smith noodling through some ballads, with the other two men sounding frankly bored or absent.I see by the liner notes that this two-fer CD was originally much different on its original LP release, with a different track listing. Perhaps it would have been best if they stuck to the tracks on the original release, rather than giving us the entire recording as they do here. As it is, there is one CD of absolutely terrific stuff, well worth buying...and another CD of what is basically hyperactive lounge music. Fortunately all the good material is concentrated on disc 2. Disc One would probably make a good coaster for your martini.

Of the two bands that try to bring a bit of that Floydian mystique into modern music (Porcupine Tree and Kula Shaker) I definitely prefer Kula Shaker. Kula Shaker's most obvious influence after pre-Darkside Floyd seems to be David Bowie, but they don't seem to take themselves very seriously, which makes them much easier to take than many of the current crop of would be psychedelic space cadets. They also know how to write a catchy tune, or more correctly, quite a few of them. And with Bob Ezrin's production help they not only approximate, but capture with a good deal of sincerity, some amazingly classic 60s/early 70s sounds. Definitely one to listen to if you are a boomer who believes Nirvana ruined everything, and for the rest of us, a guilty pleasure, but rewarding retro-psych space candy nonetheless. I like it much more than I want to let on!

This video gets four stars not for its execution (frankly, in spots it makes Blair Witch Project look like Citizen Kane) but for its subject, the mysterious Sun Ra and his Arkestra. The movie basically consists of Sun Ra talking about his philosophies, interspersed with interviews with members of the Arkestra and film of the Arkestra rehearsing and performing. However, the sound quality of this film leaves a lot to be desired; I haven't seen the newer version of this video/DVD and I hope they remaster the sound, because there are some dynamic moments here with the Arkestra.Those of us who were too young to have experienced Sun Ra in person will appreciate this documentary for the wealth of information it provides about the Arkestra and the exciting shots of Sun Ra and the Arkestra in concert. Unfortunately, the makers of the film never let the band play one song all the way through, so we never quite get to see Sun Ra and the Arkestra at full blast. However, the segment in the middle of the film where Sun Ra is sitting at his piano composing and then does a version of &quot;Round Midnight&quot; is utterly priceless. It's an all too brief glimpse of the way this compositional giant worked. The rehearsal and performance footage is equally invaluable, because it shows how Sun Ra conveyed his musical ideas to the band, and how the individual personalities fleshed out his music to create the astonishing &quot;cosmo sound&quot; of Sun Ra and his Arkestra.There are several problems with this film. The photography is grainy; the film looks like a PBS documentary filmed by college students in the late 70s, and the sound is terrible. They never identify which of Mr. Ra's compositions the band is playing in the concert segments (although &quot;Astro Black&quot; and &quot;We Travel The Spaceways&quot; are excerpted at the beginning and end of the film). These technical flaws are offset by the fact that it's one of the few documents of this underappreciated American composer that we have.Sun Ra was an amazing and interesting man, and if you are a fan of Sun Ra, the performances by the Arkestra and the interviews with the band and Mr. Ra far outweigh the film's considerable technical shortcomings. For newcomers to the omniverse of the self-proclaimed Man from Saturn, this film may only be completely mystifying, but then again, I have the feeling that Sun Ra wouldn't have minded that either. Four stars for content, two stars for execution.

It's a bit misleading to call this &quot;Choose Your Masques.&quot; They should have called it &quot;Choose Your Masques Tour.&quot; All that aside, this is a good recording of a live show from the brief period in the 80s when Nik Turner rejoined the band. The sound is much better than on Collectors' Series Vol. 1, all the instruments are audible and the balance is good. But enough with the technical details. Does it achieve Hawkwindness? Is there BLANGA? Yep. The first CD starts out a bit proggy, but by the 2nd CD the band is in full Blanga mode and attains enough altitude to leave the atmosphere in the way a live Hawkwind recording should. Nik Turner is appropriately hilarious and over-the-top here, and he can afford to be; the band is very solid and at times quite vicious, especially on the second CD. And why isn't Huw Lloyd-Langton more well-known as a guitar hero than he is?This is an excellent CD for the Hawkwind fan; most of them will want to have this. Good 80's blanga. For the newcomer, this might be an OK intro, but the Sacred Texts (In Search Of Space, Doremi Fasol Latido, Space Ritual) should be perused first by novice space cadets.

This was a terrible letdown. I had always hoped for a more complete document than &quot;Live 79,&quot; but this is NOT it. This is an audience recording, in mono, that sounds like it was done on a cassette. A decent cassette recorder, mind you, but still cassette quality. The highs are distorted, when they're there at all, the lows are boomy, and the whole recording sounds muddy. The performances here are not quite as energetic as the ones on &quot;Live '79,&quot; although they are adequate. There are more of Tim Blake's synth pieces here than on &quot;Live '79,&quot; which would be a great thing, if the recording wasn't so awful. It's a shame that the recording is so lo-fi, because if you can manage to bear with the many, many flaws in the recording, there is some good stuff here; it's just impossible for me to get through the sludgy recording quality. With all the programs out there that are available to fix and enhance recordings like this, there is really no excuse for this to sound as bad as it does. Somebody was just too lazy to fix it properly. Overall, this is definitely one for collectors only or obsessive completists. The only thing to recommend buying it is if you want an approximation of how Tim Blake sounded with the band, and even then &quot;Live '79&quot; is a better document than this. Maybe one day we'll get a good, complete live show with Tim Blake, with good sound. This, however, isn't it. A shame, really.

This came on HBO one night and I watched it until the end. I was totally fascinated, and no, not just by the toplessness. These are real people, with stories to tell that are worth hearing. As a "guy," it was highly enlightening to me to see how women view their breasts, and how they view all the issues, ideas, fantasies, etc. that are associated with them. Their stories were sad, happy, triumphant, and, yes, maybe occasionally a bit titillating (excuse the pun).The story of the woman who had a mastectomy hit me the hardest. At first, I admit, I flinched at the sight of her scar. But as I listened to her story and realized her triumph, I started to understand things about women that I'd never understood before. It was an invaluable experience.Another thing that I liked about this documentary was that even though it was given from the female point of view, it was not exclusionary. I didn't have the feeling that I was a male intruder trespassing on forbidden territory, as I do sometimes when I see some female-oriented films.After the initial shock/buzz of seeing so many different types of women with no shirts on, it wears off. The thing that draws you into this movie and keeps you there are these women's stories. In the end this becomes a very human document, a short visit with some fascinating and beautiful people who have a lot to say. Anybody looking to this for titillation will be mostly disappointed, but anyone with a brain will learn from "Breasts."

In my reviews I tend to criticize Llewellyn, but publishing this book is one of their better moves recently.DeTraci Regula knows a lot about her subject, and the book is thoughtfully and beautifully written. There's a lot of information presented here, and it's presented in a clear and direct manner. She teaches well, but avoids being didactic.The various aspects of Isis are examined in a very readable fashion, and many excellent exercises, prayers, and rituals are included. This is a book of great depth, and the more time you spend with it, the more you will get out of it. I am rereading it now and I am astonished at how much I missed the first time around.One of the things I enjoyed most about this book is Ms. Regula's writing style. She seems to invite you into the book and walk with you through the chapters; it is almost as if you were visiting a temple of Isis and she was your guide and tutor. She has a lot to say and she says it with grace and warmth.I would recommend this book very highly, both to those who are already acquainted with the Goddess of 10,000 Names and to those who are simply seeking information about The Lady of Words of Power and her worship as it continues today.

The Motherpeace Tarot, as some have stated, has not aged well. The hyper-feminist views expressed in the book, and to a lesser extent in the deck, turn off a lot of people, both women and men. The sentiment that &quot;if women ruled the world, things would be better,&quot; is nice, but it is not borne out by the careers of women like Margaret Thatcher or Elizabeth Dole. However, if someone agrees with the political views of this deck, it may work for them.But putting aside the politics, the problems I have with this deck are many. The drawings are crude and occasionally clumsy. More important to me than anything else is the way the symbolism diverges dramatically from the traditional Tarot symbolism. This is where I think this deck falls short for me. The &quot;traditional&quot; symbolism of the Tarot is there for a purpose, and it's part of what makes the cards useful for divination. If you change the symbolism radically, you are really not using a Tarot deck any more; you are using a deck of cards to perform divination, but you are not using the Tarot.The traditional tarot symbolism is important because it is based on archetypes, which work with the unconscious mind to contact the Divine and produce a reading, which is then interpreted with the conscious mind. If you introduce a new set of images there is no guarantee that this deck will relate to the subconscious archetypes in the human mind, and no guarantee that you will be able to make contact with the Divine in order to produce a relevant reading.I am told that people have used this deck with some success, and I am sure it is possible. For me, however, this deck violates the traditional Tarot symbolism too much to be useful. I feel that anyone considering buying this deck needs to keep that in mind.

This is probably the most worthless album REM ever put out. The songs are badly written, mostly constructed around punk and grunge cliches. Most of the songs have no real melody, and the ones that do have melodies sound exactly like previous REM songs. REM, in spite of their protests to the contrary, were never a punk band, and this album proves it. This was the beginning of a long downturn for REM from which they have not yet recovered; in this reviewer's opinion, they should have broken up after &quot;Automatic For The People.&quot;

There are only two songs that have ever brought me to tears. One is Sandy Denny singing &quot;The Quiet Joys Of Brotherhood&quot; on this CD. This is a transcendentally beautiful piece of work. Sandy sang with all her heart. Possibly her best solo album, and certainly something that you absolutely NEED to hear. Most of today's more accomplished female vocalists (Natalie Merchant, Sarah McLachlan included) were strongly influenced by Sandy Denny. Get this and find out why.(For the curious, the other one that brings me to tears is &quot;Songbird&quot; off Emmylou Harris' album &quot;Quarter Moon in a 10-Cent Town.&quot;)

This would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Basically a bunch of ex-metallers, burnt-out L.A. studio musicians, former bass players for David Lee Roth, and other detritus of the music industry gather together to make a quick buck knocking off their versions of the Pink Floyd's greatest hits.I can't think of a single reason to buy this, unless you're a family member/girlfriend of one of the people on this CD. And even then I'd ask you to reconsider.

This is a good book, but it is not exactly an easy book to use. The various sections are not clearly separated from one another, and the book really almost reads as one continuous piece from beginning to end at first glance.The method of Kali worship outlined here is very traditional and very particular. There are many Hindu terms used, even in the English translation, where no explanation is given, and this is not particularly helpful either.In short, this is really a book that is designed for the person who wishes to worship Kali in the way that the authors do, and the book probably goes well with their teachings. It will not be useful to someone who is not already familiar with Kali worship and Hinduism, and may in fact confuse them terribly.The problem with the book and the teachings within is that they are not practical for the person who has to deal with everyday life. Very few people have the time, or can make the time, to do these worship exercises in the way this book recommends. The poetry that appears throughout the book is beautiful, but it is difficult to read, given the line by line translation of the text, which is given first in Sanskrit, then in phonetic Sanskrit, then in English.Overall, I must admit, I found this book to be a disappointment, and I certainly would not recommend it for someone who is just being introduced to the Dark Goddess. This is a book that is very definitely oriented toward a particular type of Kali worship, and very specifically Kali worship as it is practiced and taught by Shree Ma and Swami Satyananda. If you are not a follower of those people or that particular path, this book may not be what you are looking for.If you are a follower of Shree Ma and Swami Satyananda, this book of course will go well with your studies - and you will also have the benefit, I suppose, of other material provided by them that will explain some of the terms not translated in the book, as well as the reasoning behind why the rituals are conducted in this way.However, without this knowledge, this beautiful book is quite difficult, and I suspect even if one was a student of the teachers named above, the lack of any sort of layout, section, or chapter separation would be daunting. Perhaps it would have been better to release the book simply with the English translation by itself, and provide a separate section with the Sanskrit and the phonetically translated Sanskrit text.For someone discovering Kali I would probably recommend Lex Hixon's &quot;Mother of the Universe&quot; before this. This book is primarily useful for disciples of Shree Ma and Swami Satyananda; others will find it difficult.

Come on, people, this album's not as good as all that. It's too long and too derivative. Can they do a song that doesn't sound like ten songs I haven't heard before? Can we get out of the key of G and stop doing all those sincere strummy songs, just for once? All this &quot;No Depression&quot; stuff sounds the same to me anyway, and none of these jokers have half the talent that Gram Parsons (who invented the genre years ago) did. This album included. Most of this sounds like outtakes from John Cougar Mellencamp albums, and that's not a compliment. I fail to see how this garnered all the five star reviews; to me it's a lot of rehashed, boring stuff.

You would think with the people involved with this - Peter Holsapple of the dB's, Vicki Peterson from the Bangles, Susan Cowsill from the Cowsills - this would be a guitar-pop gem. But...it's not.Most of the songs have clumsy lyrics that don't sing or scan well, with Holsapple's work being a particular offender in this department. Peterson's songs are the best ones here; her unerring ear for melody and harmony and her sparkling guitar playing do a lot for this CD. But the major problem here is the overall blandness. There's nothing on here that is particularly new or interesting sounding. The CD sounds like a reissue from any number of post-REM/dB's/Athens bands from the 80's. The production, which is flat and dulling, does not help in the least.The most distressing thing is the lack of original ideas here. For example, it has to be said that one song is a dead ripoff of a Richard Thompson tune, while "Invisible Boyfriend" is just a traditional Irish melody set to a remarkably pedestrian lyric.I wanted to like this CD a lot, since I like the participants' work in their other bands. I gave it a fair shot, but the unmemorable songs, the clumsy lyrics and the strangely flat production make this one of the most disappointing CD's I've ever endured listening to. They could do so much better than this.

In the light of current events (at this writing, the Occupy Wall Street movement) this movie seems more than prescient. Moore deconstructs the American love affair with what we revere as "capitalism," and points out exactly how it comes up short. In spite of what we are told, we will not all become millionaires, and the wealthy do not want us in their treehouse. Moore tells us this, not without compassion. There are some elements of haranguery going on, yes, and Moore remains a somewhat annoying presence at times, but overall this movie is too important to quibble about things like that. If you watched it before, watch it again. If you haven't seen it, now's the time.

The first two CD's in this set are previously unreleased live recordings from a variety of venues, and they're pretty thrilling. Rahsaan takes standards and his own originals to higher levels, using his high energy and sharp musical wit to transform whatever he plays. His fiery deconstruction of the otherwise saccharine "I Say A Little Prayer For You" must be heard to be believed. The third CD in the set is the long-lost "Natural Black Inventions: Root Strata," an album that Kirk recorded for Atlantic where he played all the instruments. This album is so far ahead of its time that most people still haven't caught up with it. Of course it didn't sell, but thanks to 32 Jazz, you can discover this supremely psychedelic and yet completely earthy jewel for yourself.I Wouldn't recommend this as an intro to Kirk, simply because it's too big. A newcomer would be better advised to start out with "The Inflated Tear" and work from there. However, for the Rahsaan Roland Kirk fan, "Dog Years" contains a lot of surprises and delights. As a document of what Rahsaan sounded like live, the first two CD's are more convincing than other live Kirk albums despite the sometimes bootleg-ish sound. The addition of "Natural Black Inventions" makes it a must for the Kirk enthusiast.

This is something of an odd pairing, since the bands have little in common other than being lumped under the "glam" category by unperceptive music critics. This is, however, one of the few chances you'll get to see what a live T. Rex show might have been like in the Electric Warrior phase of the band. And it goes without saying that there isn't much footage of Roxy Music when Brian Eno was with the band. On that basis alone it's worth seeing.The T. Rex set is interesting because the five songs selected illustrate Bolan's rise and fall deftly. This may have been unintentional, but it's interesting. The set starts with "Jeepster" and "Life's A Gas," with the basic band from the "Electric Warrior" album. Marc Bolan is elfin, sexy, charming, and rocking, and it's not hard to see why he became a star based on this. Sure it's a little sloppy, but this is T. Rex, it's not like it's King Crimson (to use a contemporary). From the "Electric Warrior" songs, the DVD goes to "Ride a White Swan" and "Jewel," which features T. Rex during their transition from an acoustic hippy act to electric pop stars. No drum kit, just Mickey Finn on some percussion, and Bolan launches off on an ill-advised but funny guitar solo on Jewel. In spite of the sloppiness it's still engaging. The same can't be said of "20th Century Boy," which is downright depressing. Bolan looks sick and bloated, and worse still, seems to be posing and taking himself far too seriously as a Rock Star. The rest of the band looks drugged and unwell. It reminds the viewer that Bolan hit a bad period, and that "20th Century Boy" was one of the last of his singles to make any serious impact on the charts. A sad and disappointing finish to the T. Rex segment.The Roxy Music segment is nothing but great. For one thing, it's funny to see early Brian Eno. For the past 30 years or so Eno has painstakingly cultivated the image of the coolly intellectual sound scientist. Here, he's dressed like a gay toreador on acid, hops around the stage shaking his booty when he's not making outrageous noise on a synth, and wears more makeup than Tammy Faye Bakker. For the record, he has on the same outfit as on the inside cover of "For Your Pleasure," which is where most of the songs come from.The band is definitely on, and they tear through versions of "Do The Strand," "Re-Make/Re-Model," "In Every Dream Home A Heartache," and "Editions of You." It's hard to describe how good this is. Roxy replicates the songs admirably onstage. Ferry looks the perfect dandy, his white suit contrasting with the crude look of the club they're playing in, taking organ solos and doing a little mugging. Phil Manzanera burns on the guitar, jumping up and down as he plays, and as usual Andy MacKay varies between Ace Cannon/King Curtis wailing and Albert Ayler freakiness. The last two clips, "Virginia Plain," and "All I Want Is You" are from other shows. "Virginia Plain" seems slightly slower than the record and more restrained somehow, but still comes off well. "All I Want Is You" is from the band's "Country Life" album and features an Eno-less group, with Ferry much more suave and less frenetic in his fascist tank commander outfit and pencil-thin mustache. The song, however, is brilliantly performed and closes out the Roxy Music part of the DVD nicely.All in all I would say this is definitely worth it for the Roxy Music part of the program. The T. Rex part of the program suffers from the inclusion of "20th Century Boy," but then again, the rest of the T. Rex selections show Bolan and Co. at their most engaging. A worthwhile purchase especially if you are a fan of one or both of the bands. Its historical value is inarguable, and musically (especially with Roxy) it's great.

I have seen a lot of anime, and I have put up with the usual disconnected and/or stupid storylines and insipid and/or ridiculous characters, but this one is absolutely the worst. The characters are named after desserts. The basic plotline for all the very short bits (I can't bring myself to call them stories) on this videotape go as follows: Carrot Glace, who looks like an undernourished version of Goku from DZ, is horny. He goes after the first girl he sees. He gets in trouble with an Evil Wizard. The other four members of the team, which include a dominatrix, a chick who pretends to be a dominatrix, a gay wizard who waves a card around meaninglessly, and your typical Big Dumb Strong Guy, fish him out of his trouble. .... None of these Evil Wizards are very frightening or even remotely interesting. None of the Sorcerer Hunters are interesting in the slightest, they're all carbon copies of other anime characters you've seen before, minus any observable personality. Carrot Glace, who seems to be the main character, is purely annoying on a level hitherto unknown to man. He makes Spritle and Chim-Chim seem like mental giants by comparison.There is so much other good anime out there right now you could watch. There is absolutely NO reason to insult yourself with this exercise in complete and total idiocy. This is not only the dumbest anime I've ever seen, this may be the dumbest thing calling itself &quot;entertainment&quot; that I've ever forced myself to watch. I kept thinking, &quot;Surely it must get better.&quot; It doesn't. I beg you to spare yourself this wretched mess.To add insult to injury, ADV has tacked on TWENTY MINUTES -- yes, I said TWENTY MINUTES, I timed it - of coming attraction previews. That proves they knew how lame this is. Why they even bothered to release it is beyond me.Avoid this at all costs. Please. I wish I had.

It's important to recognize that Coltrane was a spiritual player, and many people who approach his music nonspiritually (especially the later works) completely miss this point. Nels Cline and Greg Bendian do not. This is not an empty shredfest but almost a rechanneling of Trane for a new century, done by two players who absolutely know what they're doing and absolutely hit the mark. This CD basically made me believe the electric guitar could be a valid instrument again.

Well, I bought it when it was new in 1998, and I keep going back to it trying to give it a chance, but &quot;Out There&quot; just leaves me cold. Part of the problem here is that Jimmie's &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy turns into &quot;less is less&quot; here. There's just not enough music. I understand laid back, and I understand not being cluttered, but there's a lot of completely empty space here with no vibe at all to it. Instead of sounding &quot;ragged but right&quot; it sounds like he was too tired to finish the songs.The much-vaunted B-3 does NOT substitute well here for a bass guitar. Jimmie spends more time not-playing than he does playing, and as a result the lack of a bass guitar makes the music sound more empty. If you're going to go the &quot;organ trio&quot; route you have to play more on the guitar, using more strongly voiced chords and thickening the tone to fill in the aural space. Jimmie barely plays any chords on the whole recording, and although I admire his philosophy of restraint, through a lot of this record it sounds less like restraint and more like he was either unable or unwilling to actually give the songs a good treatment.Not that the songs are anything to write home about. With the exception of &quot;Feel Like A King,&quot; the writing gets more and more drab and cliche'd as the CD rolls along. Of course blues is not noted for being original in the lyrics department, but most of the lyrics here sound like Jimmie could barely be bothered to write them. And if that was the case, why not just make an all-instrumental album? No shame in that, certainly less aggravating than the throwaway lyrics displayed here. Any good lyrics on this album come from other writers for the most part.Even worse, the energy level on this CD noticeably drops with each song. The first number, &quot;Feel Like A King,&quot; is great, but as we get past &quot;The Ironic Twist,&quot; the music starts losing energy rapidly, culminating in the sluggish, dismal, never-should-have-been-recorded song, &quot;Astral Projection Blues,&quot; which is quite honestly one of the worst songs I've ever heard on a major-label record in my life. It drags the album down to an almost unbearable level, which isn't helped at all by the throwaway instrumental &quot;Little Son, Big Sun,&quot; which also could have gone unrecorded.&quot;Little Son...&quot; is an aimless bit of bluesy fingerpicking which anyone in the world could have done, and it goes nowhere. These are the last two songs on the album and they definitely leave a sour taste in the listener's mouth, because quite frankly they're terrible. You mean to tell me that with Dr. John and Nile Rogers hanging around, they couldn't have come up with some better-written, livelier-performed material to finish off the CD? I don't believe it.Jimmie Vaughan is a good talent, but this and his previous release shows that he is essentially directionless, and needs a real live band (not just a gang of friends goofing with him in the studio) to motivate him into doing the kind of playing he did with the Thunderbirds. As it stands this album sounds disinterested and half-finished. Laid back is OK, but out cold is not. Let's hope Jimmie actually wakes up for the next one and puts some effort into it. This lackadaisical stuff is the kind of music that kills careers. Somebody buy this boy a Mr. Coffee machine before it's too late!

Willie Dixon as a songwriter and arranger was near-genius. Willie Dixon, as a performer, had problems, not the least of which was his lackadaisical voice. This recording is interesting in a historical sense, but nearly all of the songs here were done better by other artists in the Chess stable.It may seem hard to say that about Dixon, but wishful thinking will not make these recordings more important or interesting than they really are. A few cuts on here are flat out novelty songs and could have languished in the vaults, or been issued on compilations sandwiched in between much better songs (as on the Willie Dixon box set).Overall, proof once more that Dixon's talent was in songwriting and arranging, but not as a frontman.

I hoped for a good exposition on the history of Paganism and Witchcraft. Instead, I got a book that was very typical of what Llewellyn is releasing these days. Ms. Moura's idyllic view of the Indus Valley civilizations is not accurate, and does not agree with the archaeological evidence. It isn't possible, from the archaeological evidence, to determine exactly who or what the Mohenjo-Daro civilization worshipped or believed, nor is it possible to say how they lived. In fact, one structure that Ms. Moura identifies as a &quot;temple&quot; is believed by a great many archaeologists to be a public bath. This kind of pick-choose-&amp;-fabricate interpretation of archaeology is the kind of stuff that frankly makes Wiccans and Pagans a laughingstock among serious researchers. Ms. Moura's interpretations of archaeological evidence get more convoluted and peculiar from that point, and evolve outward into pure fantasy by the middle of the book.Other reviewers have pointed out the more specific flaws in the history and science of this book. I was disappointed to note the innumerable typos, typical of Llewellyn books, and even clumsy grammatical errors that made parts of the book impossible to interpret - or to take seriously.At one time, the Llewellyn symbol on a book meant something, and in their back catalogue Llewellyn has a great many triumphs of publishing in the Pagan/Wiccan/Occult field. Unfortunately, in recent years, the desire to make money has taken hold at Llewellyn, and they have published a great many books that are unreliable, full of errors, and even dangerous, not to mention badly edited and poorly written. It is terrible to see how far down Llewellyn has fallen in their pursuit of the almighty dollar. Although Ann Moura seemingly means well and does not obviously mean to misguide or misinform, &quot;Origins of Modern Witchcraft&quot; is more of a work of fantasy than fact. If Llewellyn continues to publish books of this poor a quality, they will erode what little credibility they have left in the Pagan/Wiccan community. It would be a shame to see that happen. But it's also a shame to mislead and misinform people by publishing inaccuracies and outright fantasies about Wicca and Paganism, so perhaps the loss of credibility is the price you pay for sacrificing integrity for money.

In a country scene where we are deluged with people rewriting '70s Fleetwood Mac songs and singing them with phony country accents over backdrops created by studio musicians and ProTools, this guy stands out from the dull Nashville Garth/Shania clones and shames them all with his down-home songwriting and fiendish guitar playing. I docked this one star for the fact that it's too damn short; 35 minutes of this guy is definitely NOT enough. Junior is a walking encyclopedia of 50s and early 60s country and rock styles, but the amazing thing is that he manages to invest them all with his own wryly humorous twist. Even on the depressing ballads, like &quot;I Want To Hear It From You,&quot; and &quot;Parole Board,&quot; he manages to maintain a sincerity that carries these songs through, where other artists would simply sound maudlin and contrived.The insanely stellar guitar work can't go without mention. He's like Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant all in one body, and is probably one of the wittiest guitar players I've ever heard. The things he does with the lap steel (NOT TABLETOP STEEL, thanks very much) neck on his dual-neck monstrosity are worth your attention alone. Never mind the lightning quick regular guitar leads and fills, which leave a lot of what passes for guitar playing these days in the dust.To sum up, if you like REAL country music, Junior Brown is your man. If you are sick of homogenized, synthesized, syrupy phony country created by record companies to sell units to overweight sleepy yuppies, Junior Brown is the perfect antidote.

This was the first Pharoah Sanders CD I ever bought, and I guess it accomplished its purpose; it made me want to hear everything he did. On that level this CD is a success. But on another level, it's not satisfactory, because mostly it focuses on Pharoah's lyrical side and his more or less straight-ahead work. That's only a part of Sanders' music. A new-age fan might love this CD but then be utterly frightened by albums like Karma and Thembi, where Sanders takes you on a trip through meditative music to furious free jazz energy and back again. Pharoah's free jazz energy work is just not fairly represented here. I love his multiphonic screaming sessions just as much as I love his lyrical, meditative side, and it's a shame this collection chooses just to focus on his mellower work. It shortchanges a really great artist, which is why I can only give this recording three stars. This CD is a good starter, and for some people it will be sufficient, but for those with adventurous souls, buy &quot;Thembi&quot; or &quot;Karma&quot; and jump in the deep end, and leave this for those who can't swim yet.

Jaya Lakshmi is pretty devoted to Krishna. I don't have a problem with that, and I don't have a problem with devotional music. However, sad but true, devotional albums tend to be boring and bland.Jaya Lakshmi is neither. &quot;Ocean of Mercy,&quot; to me, is nothing less than excellent psychedelic folk music. It's probably the best psychedelic folk album I've heard in a long, long time, although I'm pretty certain Ms. Lakshmi herself might have a problem with my description of it as psychedelic.But psychedelic it is. Layers of beautiful vocals float on waves of 12 string and flamenco-styled guitar, sarod and other Indian instruments, and trippy keyboards, with very careful use of programming in the drum and percussion department. The music is lush but lucid, exotic without being alienating and lovely without any sense of being cloying. Jaya has created a sound here that is quite capable of taking you away into her world. And any music that can take you away into another world is psychedelic in my book.The songs here are versions of Sanskrit chants and songs honoring Krishna. I have heard Krishna chants and songs before, and believe me, in their raw form, they are not half so melodic and gorgeous as Ms. Lakshmi makes them sound. I suspect that she has contributed more than a little in the melody and harmony departments to touch them up along the way, and is probably too humble to admit it.The end result is that not only do they sound fabulous, the songs get stuck in your head. I find myself playing this CD an awful lot, and even more interesting, hearing it in my head a good bit as well even when I'm away from a CD player.I am quite infatuated with this CD. It is lush, sensual-spiritual, and the music is as beautiful and clear as Ms. Lakshmi's green eyes on the cover of the CD. Whether you're into yoga and Krishna or not, it doesn't matter. Jaya Lakshmi's &quot;Ocean of Mercy&quot; is a flat-out gorgeous piece of work. I would imagine that Jaya's goddess namesake is well pleased.

My friends, if my mother's prayers are somehow heard by the Main Man Upstairs and by some unbelievable chance I make it to Heaven, I do not expect to hear the sounds of orchestras playing Mozart or choirs singing Bach. I know in my heart that the Staple Singers' music will infiltrate every micrometer of Heaven.This is powerful stuff. Every single word that Mavis sings, every thought expressed in these songs, is still absolutely relevant to our times, as relevant as they were in the 70's. People still can't get along. The races are still fighting with each other. There ain't enough love in the world. This world would be so much better if we would all work together for the good of each other. Those messages have not dated. And those are the messages that the Staple Singers give.A lot of people say those messages are corny in these days of Nine Inch Nails and the desperate empty mechanical clamor that is most of the music of our time. The Staple Singers' music puts the lie to all that, it makes post-modern cynicism and mean-spiritedness seem weak and irrelevant.But not only is this deeply spiritual music on a level that few artists ever reach; it is also a deeply funky music, with roots in the Delta fingerpicking bluesmen that Pops Staples learned his craft from and the burning gospel choirs of Mississippi churches where the Staples learned their art. Ray Charles took church music and made it funky; the Staples took funky music and put it back in the church. Christianity has lost so much by divorcing the mind from the body, the heart from the spirit, and insisting on a bland asceticism that profits no one. The Staples Singers come from a tradition where everyone is granted the same compassion, where the body of the worshiper and the urge to move and dance is accepted, where the whole human is God's and not just the socially acceptable, &quot;nice&quot; aspects. Mavis' voice is alluring and soulful, not &quot;heavenly&quot; as it is commonly percieved - which only means that our perception of heavenliness is all wrong.Every single song on here is a gem. The vocal arrangements, powerful multiple call and response statements between the band, the singers, and Pops' guitar, the bass and drums that vibrate you on an irresistible level where you have to move; there really isn't much like this music anywhere else on earth.I don't care if you're a Christian, a Pagan, a Buddhist, Jewish, or a flat-out stonewall atheist. This is some of the best music humans have ever made, and it contains a profoundly positive spiritual message that is completely free of exclusivity or schmaltz. This music is a vision of a better world and encouragement to make it happen.Or as Mavis Staples says, &quot;Are you ready? Come go with me.&quot; Where to? &quot;The city in the Sky.&quot; Listen to this and you'll be ready to head there too.

Great double-feature for a dull evening: two classic "guys in rubber suits" monster films featuring much destruction of toy cities, improbable plot twists, and hysterically bad dialogue.

25 Year-Old: This band is amazing! Have you heard these guys?43 Year-Old: Yeah, I have. This is a good band for sure.25-Year-Old: You're not as enthusiastic as you should be! These guys are doing something DIFFERENT!43-year-old: Well, not really. The jump-cut editing and the noise bursts combined with the freaky jamming remind me a lot of Faust, especially on Faust's first album.25-year-old: Are you saying they're imitating Faust? And who's Faust? You mean DJ Faust?43-year-old: NO. Faust was a band of insane German hippies who made some really interesting records in the 1970's that influenced a lot of people. Go look up &quot;So Far&quot; by Faust on Amazon. And Deerhoof is not imitating Faust, that's not what I'm saying.25-year-old: So what ARE you saying, you old coot?43-year-old: Watch it, kid, you'll be my age someday. What I am saying is that Deerhoof has the same sense of uninhibited experimentalism that Faust had. They sound like they just don't give a flip what anybody thinks and they want to play whatever they want, which is really cool in this corporate rock era.25-year-old: So you *do* get it.43-year-old: Of course I do. Listen, punk, I knew about &quot;noise rock&quot; before you were even dirtying your diapers properly. Back in my day we used to call it &quot;art rock&quot; and that's what this is. It's good art rock, with a lot of energy and freakishness. Plus, I like the singer and her weird &quot;The animals will testify against us on Judgment Day&quot; pronouncement on the first song.25-year-old: That's the second song.43-year-old: Whatever. I don't consider 30 seconds of bells and burping a song.25-year-old: You don't think rap is music either.43-year-old: Don't get me started. Let's just be glad that Deerhoof is a great band that we can both agree on, OK?

This is the Bonzos' fourth, and final (in their original formation) album. It received a lot of bad reviews at the time it was released (1969) because a lot of reviewers didn't perceive it as being as &quot;funny&quot; as their other albums. Humor figured a lot into the Bonzos' work, to be sure, but Neil Innes and Viv Stanshall were also good songwriters and lyricists, and this album was meant to focus on that aspect of their work. It was also a &quot;concept album,&quot; based around Innes' idea, &quot;What if we thought we were sane, but we were actually insane and didn't know it?&quot; Out of this loose concept came this album. It also reflects the Bonzos' lives at the time, which were not terribly happy. They were poorly managed and had been touring incessantly with nothing to show for it. Their management was so dreadful that when one of the bandmembers' wives had a miscarriage while they were on the road, they neglected to tell him until after the tour was over, so as not to interrupt the bookings. And in spite of the touring, they made no money.In the face of all this, the Bonzos reacted by making an album which was more focused on their musicianship, and which reflected the chaos that was their lives at the time. Neil Innes contributes two heartfelt and lovely songs which rival Ray Davies in their winsomeness and nostalgia (Quiet Talks and I Want To Be With You), while Stanshall takes his razor wit to the entertainment industry (Look At Me I'm Wonderful) and lust (Tent). The sardonic &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot; is a comment on all the sleazy pubs and bad gigs they played, and Stanshall's &quot;The Odd Boy&quot; is his funny, but somehow sad, tribute to everyone who was ever an outcast at school. &quot;You Done My Brain In&quot; and &quot;Busted,&quot; which bookend the album, are reflections of their dazed and pummeled mindset, but they also show that they had not lost their sense of humor or their resilience; no self-pity here. And &quot;Mr. Slater's Parrot,&quot; dedicated to their sax player's cantankerous bird, is a classic Bonzos take on 20's jazz. All in all this is a surprising and revealing album. The Bonzos could have made another &quot;Gorilla&quot; or &quot;Tadpoles,&quot; but they chose not to; they chose to take a chance and reveal a bit more of themselves without losing the humor and sense of whimsical adventure that marked their other albums. This is another forgotten classic, and deserves to be heard by anyone who is interested in the immense fount of creativity that was British rock in the 60s.

The Bonzo Dog Band is probably best known for starting the career of Neil Innes, who wrote songs for Monty Python and co-created (in spite of what Eric Idle may say) the Rutles. But the other talent in the band was the unjustly ignored Vivian Stanshall, a comic genius of the first order. Together with the rest of the Bonzos, Stanshall and Innes created a band that was like no other. &quot;Urban Spaceman&quot; (known in England as &quot;The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse,&quot;) is their second album. Their first album, &quot;Gorilla,&quot; was devoted to recreating hot jazz of the 20s, a bit like a 60s version of Squirrel Nut Zippers. This album is where they branched out and began reinventing - and poking fun at - rock and roll. The title track, &quot;Urban Spaceman,&quot; is the most well-known, but there are many satirical jewels here, and some very freaked-out stuff as well. Listen to their take on the British blues boom, the sardonic &quot;Can Blue Men Sing The Whites,&quot; and marvel at their recreation/parody of early Pink Floyd in &quot;We Are Normal.&quot; (Extra points if you know who Bert Weedon is.) &quot;Humanoid Boogie&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Zelda,&quot; are great rock songs, as well as being sly parodies of several different genres of music. And &quot;11 Mustachioed Daughters&quot; is just plain spooky, really, ending the album on a very odd note. The Bonzo Dog Band was one of the most unfairly ignored groups of the 60s, and this is one of their best albums, if not the best. The Beatles were real fans, as were the members of Monty Python, who worked with the Bonzos before they became Monty Python. Paul McCartney produced the single, &quot;Urban Spaceman,&quot; and he featured them in &quot;Magical Mystery Tour,&quot; as well. This is a forgotten 60s rock classic, and a very funny album to boot. It has stood fantastically well against the ravages of time and has many delights to offer. Long live the Bonzos!

In the name of all that you hold holy, DO NOT BUY THIS.I read a bunch of hype - and that's all that it is - in indie music rags about Magical Power Mako and how wonderful and psychedelic he is. They had me sold. I was ready to hear the man they compared to Syd Barrett and Roky Erickson and immerse myself in his sound-universe.Much to my horror this CD only barely resembled music at all, let alone the works of Barrett and Erickson. The music is tremendously badly recorded, with extreme tape hiss, flutter and wow evident. It goes beyond lo-fi and even no-fi. Most of it sounds like it was recorded by a cheap cassette deck in a garbage can across the street from where the music was being performed. I am NOT exaggerating; this is one of the worst-recorded things I've ever heard in my life, and I've heard some desperately bad stuff.There aren't any songs per se, just uninteresting riffs repeated over and over that segue aimlessly into insanely poorly recorded acoustic guitar with someone moaning in the background, which is in its turn abruptly interrupted by a big muzzy noise of some sort, perhaps a washing machine with a mike stuck into it. To make matters worse, in spite of the fact there are "songs" indicated on the cover, the CD plays like one long track from beginning to end. You can't skip over anything or even forward through it effectively. Not that there's anything worth skipping to, or even listening to here.I am not a guy who needs slickness in my music. I have heard badly recorded and bizarre stuff before and dug it. I like many, many strange things. This isn't strange or psychedelic, it's pure and utter garbage.There are certain artists who are undeservedly obscure, no doubt about that. So by extension there are "artists" who are deservedly obscure, who absolutely should be ignored, no matter what any indie rock critic or British magazine says about them. Magical Power Mako's "Music From Heaven," is deservedly obscure. If this is music from Heaven, you might want to arrange to go to the other place instead.

It starts off with a live version of &quot;Brainstorm&quot; which is pretty good, but just as it gets up a head of steam the whole thing sort of drifts into a...uh...reggae song? And a bad reggae song at that! Which deflates all the impetus they've built up, so even when they try to segue back into &quot;Brainstorm,&quot; the energy is lost. &quot;Alchemy,&quot; the following track, is better, even if it is basically a rehash of &quot;Hassan I Sabah,&quot; but then all of a sudden everything comes crashing to a halt with &quot;Love In Space,&quot; which is dreadful, awful, and cheesy; lounge music for the Starship Enterprise. After that nothing really takes off, although I have to give points for the &quot;Rat Race/Aerospace Age Inferno/First Landing On Medusa&quot; medley; it rocks.But even that is shot down by the silly &quot;I Am The Reptoid,&quot; which is followed by the even sillier &quot;The Nazca,&quot; with a cosmic female voice announcing New Age platitudes over a mushy synth track. The rest of the CD gradually runs completely out of energy, terminating in &quot;Diana Park,&quot; which is dreadful fake-Santana noodling. Even dedicated Hawk fans won't find much to like here, and non-Hawk fans will find it unlistenable. Better luck next time, guys.

Poor Arthur...stuck in a dead end job, living in a little house, making ends meet (just barely). His kids are dissatisfied with their lives and with him. Arthur's beloved country, which used to be a world power, is fading in influence, and the people who are supposed to represent the citizens in government are now just venal and corrupted lackeys to the rich. Arthur finds comfort in thinking of the past where everything seemed so orderly and safe, but everything is different now; it's changed, but not for the better...hm, sound familiar?&quot;Arthur,&quot; unlike most other English rock albums of the day, is about real people in the real England of 1969. Not paisley hippies wearing swirly frocks, but the people that Ray Davies knew and grew up with, the people who get up and go to work each day and keep things running while the swirly-frock people twitter and glitter.Rock music in 1969 was all about escaping, either escaping through fantasy and drugs (the Who) or through sex and drugs (The Rolling Stones) or through just being rich, arty and drugged up enough to avoid having to deal with reality at all (The Beatles). The Kinks' &quot;Arthur&quot; is the absolute antithesis of all that was going on in pop music in 1969, and as a result it was almost inevitable that people wouldn't understand.Too bad for them. Ray Davies' songwriting is at its absolute best here. He is an acute observer of the human condition. He might make gentle fun of the ordinary guy who buys a hat like Anthony Eden &quot;because it makes him feel like a lord,&quot; but he is never cruel or vindictive toward the ordinary people who make up the landscape of &quot;Arthur.&quot; Davies is not afraid to excoriate the rich and powerful who take advantage of the Arthurs of the world, as he does in &quot;Yes Sir No Sir,&quot; and &quot;Brainwashed,&quot; but he's never a doctrinaire revolutionary, as so many rockers were in those days.Davies also has something that most of his songwriting contemporaries lacked: compassion. This album is loaded with the idea that you have to cut people some slack, that you have to understand them and love them the way they are. No matter how difficult things are, family is family, and in order to make it work you have to make allowances for people, and try to do the best you can for each other. That's the underlying message of &quot;Arthur,&quot; and it's more effective than a million &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; chants, in the long run.Oh yeah: this album rocks, too. Dave Davies is truly brilliant here; &quot;Arthur&quot; is a shining moment for him. His fills, his riffing, his leads, his singing: all are dead-on perfect. John Dalton, who joined the band on bass after the accident-prone and road-burnt Pete Quaife left, continues the tradition that the Kinks had of hiring butt-kicking bass players, and Mick Avory drums up everything from skiffle rhythms to jazz to straight-ahead rock.This is one of the Kinks' best albums, but more than that, it's one of the best rock albums, ever. It sounds more pointed and relevant as the years go by, instead of less. How much art can you say that about?On the CD nerd commentary front, this Castle Communications reissue is the one to get; it's been remastered splendidly and contains a slew of extra songs. Most of the extra songs are Dave Davies' tunes, many meant for a solo album that never quite materialized. They're well worth hearing, as is the rest of this splendid album.
