I purchased this alarm to replace an old alarm that began chirping frequently. After taking it outside (on a power cord) where it continued chirping in fresh air I realized it reached end of its life.This new alarm has a helpful notice right on it which explains what the beeps mean:1) When everything is working fine and there is no problem it is silent2) When it detect CO levels it emits 4 beeps pause 4 beeps pause (red light flashes rapidly)3) When the unit malfunction malfunctions it gives 3 chirps every minute (red light flashes 3 time a minute)4) When it reaches the end of line if chirps 5 times every minute (red light flashes 5 times a minute)This unit is light and fairy small (smaller than the unit it replaced) and it is a plug-in only unit (no battery back up). Photo of the alarm next to the ruler attached.The important notice for installation that CO alarms (unlike smoke alarms) should be installed low in the room. If the detector is placed in a long hallway (more than 40 feet or 12 meters) each end of the hall way should have a detector. They should not be placed near a fan as blowing air could interfere with detection of CO. Putting the detector in direct sun light will shorten its life. Humidity and dusty area also interferes with detection so the alarm should not placed in the bathroom, garages, unfinished attics.Maintenance: The instructions recommend vacuuming the unit cover once a month using a soft brush attachment. Do NOT perform wet cleaning. It also recommends frequent tests test/silence button. The test emits 4 beeps, pause, 4 beeps, pause sequence for 5-6 seconds. The test is recommended to be performed once a week.This detector has a 7-year limited warranty, so this is how long I would expect it to last.You can locate the manual on www firstalert com and look for the model number CO600. This will bring up the product page with 4 tabs: Features, Specification, Download manual, Package image.Ali Julia review

I read this book out loud during a very long 7 day drive to keep my husband and I alert and entertained during a long ride. I loved reading this book! It is written in beautiful language, with a lot of humor, and gave us insight into a great man. I was particularly impressed in how he self-taught himself. The persistence and diligence with which he learned to write and debate well was very inspiring. His constant work on self-improvement really impressed me. Reading this book turned what could have been a tiring ride into a very entertaining one.The autobiography is unfinished, he did not include his pursuits of electricity nor did the book contained his thought on the Revolution. I enjoyed it so much that I wished there was more!I highly recommend it.Ali Julia review

I am an experienced quilter, who enjoys creating quilts and is interested in the history of quilt making. This book contains no illustrations or instructions on making quilts. However, it contains a very detailed and interesting history of quilts and quilt making. I learned a lot of small new details that I did not know before and enjoyed reading this book very much.The book was written n 1915 and starts with a brief explanation of quilt making. Then it starts its journey into the history of quilt making. The roots of quilting and weaving are dated back by their appearance in ancient art work. For example, the images of a loom appear in 2650 B.C. The old piece of patchwork can be found in a Museum of cairo and dates to 960 B.C.The book traces the appearance of patchwork during Trojan War, Middle Ages, Renaissance. Appliqu&eacute; makes it appearance in Florence (described as cut work). There a very lengthy chapter on history of quilts in America, which I found very interesting. There is an interesting chapter on quilt block names. I never gave the block names much thought but the author organized them by themes such as political, religion, sky. and it gave me a fresh new way to think about the blocks I know and love.I found the book educational and enjoyable. Great trip into history!Ali Julia review

I like drying some delicates outdoors, drying outdoors makes them smell so nice! Before I purchased this hanger I would need to get my drying rack onto the deck and then put it away when things were dry. With this hanger it is much easier and just as effective for my purposes.I am attaching a collage of 5 pictures under customer photos at the top of the main product page.Photo#1 shows a close up of the hanger extended with the hanger on it. It is sturdy and easily supports several cloth hangers.Photo#2 shows a closed hanger when it is not in use. It is slim and practically invisible.I was very impressed with the assembly instructions that came with the hanger. Not only were they clear about small details, they also included a paper template which allows you to mark the screw positions very easily.Photo#2 Shows the assembly of the hanger. The two parts come apart easily when the metal support is slid out of the notch. You can see the notch in photo #1, which shows the hanger open. It is towards the top, on the right hand side of the main slit.Photo#4 has a ruler next to metal support and shows that the metal support arm is 13.5" long.Photo#5 has a ruler next to hanger when it is closed and shows that it is 17.5" long. It is 2.5" wide.For easy mounting I separated the two parts of the hanger. Then I found the stud, marked screw locations with the paper template, and drilled the pilot holes for the screws. Then I drilled in the screws half way working only with the bottom part of the hanger. When I had about 1/4 of inch clearance left, I snapped in the second half of the hanger and tightened the top screw. Then I tightened the bottom screw. After that I slid the metal back through the notch. I am not the handiest person around yet this whole process took about 10 minutes (most of it was measuring and making sure the hanger was in the comfortable position to reach).To dry things outside I use a nifty hanger that automatically locks after you hang it, so the wind has no change of blowing off the hangerWhitmor 6027-533 Designer Plastic Clip and Drip Hangers.I have been using the hanger for several weeks and I am very pleased with it. It is well designed, unobtrusive and does exactly what I needed it for.Ali Julia review

After a back surgery it was painful for me to squeeze hard with my hands, and I found OXO Good Grips Garlic Press is the one I could use without being in pain. This is a lever-style garlic press and it lets you mince cloves with minimal pressure. In addition it has an ergonomic grip that is very comfortable in my hand.To prolong its life I don't wash it in the dishwasher, I wash it by hand using the build-on rubber cleaner. The press flips backwards and the red plastic head aligns with the press to clean it.To make it easier for me to press (and it is probably easier on the garlic press itself too) I peel garlic cloves before pressing them.I have read a number of reviews that report that the press breaks at the hinge, but I have been using mine for over a year and it has been fine so far. I also read in one of the comments that OXO replaced the broken press even past the warranty period, so if the press break I will follow that advice and contact the company.If you have weak hands or a medical condition that makes it difficult to squeeze the handles this is a particularly good garlic press to have, it really helped me enjoy cooking with garlic even post surgery.Ali Julia review

I am an experienced quilter who loves Elly Sienkiewicz style of quilts, and owns a number of her books. I enjoyed this book, and already done a project inspired by the ideas presented in this book.This book is aimed an experienced quilter who owns "Baltimore Beauties and Beyond", her first book in this series. Many of the projects in this book reference her first book for detailed instructions. This book will not teach you how to do it, it is the source for inspiration and ideas.So given my background I enjoyed this book, however it might be frustrating if this is the first book by Elly Sienkiewicz that you have purchased.

I need a timer not for cooking, but for helping keep on a schedule to avoid long periods of time sitting without getting up. I have a lot of problems with my back, including several surgeries, and one of the things the doctors recommended me is to avoid sitting for a long time without getting up for a few seconds every 20-30 minutes. I often get absorbs at work, not noticing how quickly the time passes, so I was looking for a simple timer that I can easily set to 20 minutes and reset over and over again.It works very well! I use it either using a little stand, or the magnet on the little stand, or often by juststuffing it into my pocket. It has been realiable and so far has been doing this 18 hour a day job on the same battery.The buttons are big and simple to operate, the numbers are large and easy to see. Simple and perfect!Ali Julia review

I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues. I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy, are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years, and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand. They operate very smoothly, they lock very smoothly, much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used. And they work! I can cut through some thick branches with ease, despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner.

This is a very simple sprinkler. You control it by increase or decrease water pressure by how wide you open the spigot of water to which the hose is attached. How much of the area is covered depends on how strong your water pressure is at its max. The biggest area I can get is about 10 feet square. And, of course, anything less is obtained by just by turning down the water flow.This sprinkler works well for spot watering. I have two small areas in the front lawn that I need to water, so I move the sprinkler a few times to get the entire area covered.Since it has no moving parts this is going to outlast all my other rotation and oscillating sprinklers that I use in the back yard. The only down side of this sprinkler that it is very light, so if the hose does not want to lay flat (which is often the case) this sprinkler will not stay flat, it cannot fight what the hose wants to do. There is a little loop of metal at the very tip which can be used to pin the sprinkler to the ground. If you push a nail through the hole and into the ground at a slight angle it will provide some resistance to the twist from the hose.I bought a square and circle of this sprinkler. Frankly, it appears to me that they water the same shape, mostly controlled by how the wind blows. I am attaching a photo of this sprinkler next to a pen, so you can see the relative size of it.This is a good economical solution for a small area.

I purchased a small base quad cane after back surgery to help me walk up the stairs. If you need a cane for walking up the stairs it is very important to get the cane with a small base so all four legs will fit onto a step.I was taught how to use this cane in a rehabilitation facility. The cane is unstable if you use it the wrong way. The four leg base is not symmetrical. On one side two legs are spaced a little close together, on the other side a little more wide apart. It is very important to have the wide part AWAY from the body. The base can be switched based on whether you want to use right handed or left handed. This positioning makes a huge difference.When the cane came from the factory it was set for the wrong hand, and if I did not have my lesson on stability I probably would have used it as is and would have been unhappy with stability of the cane. I hope this helps someone else!

I wear size-7.5 in a regular shoe and got size-8 Sloggers. My feet are not super wide, but not narrow either. The Sloggers are a perfect fit. I have been wearing Sloggers for a couple of weeks now. They are very comfortable, and I have been wearing them not only in the garden or washing the car, but when I have to do quick errands in the rain. Yesterday, it was pouring and I actually wore them to work, so I was in Sloggers for about 12 hours! I had no problems at all. I was as comfortable in the evening as I was in the morning. My feet were NOT hot and sweaty despite not taking them off for such a long time.Sloggers are a bit heavier than I expected. They are made of rubberized material top and bottom. No openings anywhere, so they are very good for walking in wet grass. Surprisingly, my feet do not get too hot despite having no ventilation in the shoe. The sole of the shoe is nicely textured. I am attaching a photo which shows the top and the bottom of the shoe. Next to the shoe I positioned a ruler so you can see how high the back of the shoe rises. The back is not totally open, it has a slight rise which help to keep your foot firmly in the shoe. The bottom of the show has some padding, so it provides nice support for the foot and is responsible for very comfortable feeling. And of course they are very easy to put on and take off, which is very handy when your hands are covered with dirt from the garden.The second photo I am attaching to this review shows my foot wearing the shoe, hopefully this gives a better idea of the look and fit than just the shoe by itself. In a close-up you can see a bit of room in the back - the difference between size-7.5 foot and size-8 shoe.The men a work made fun of the shoes, they thought they were ugly (what do they know?), but I think they are cute plus very comfortable and functional.

I noticed a recall notice for AmerTac LED nights which effected night lights sold between March 2009 and January 2011. I went to check my AmerTac lights that looks exactly as the one pictured here. I've had them for over 3 years without any problems. The one in the bathroom is always on, unless I have the light on and it was only barely warm when I touched it.The back of the light has a UL sticker and the model number is 71352, 120V 60HZm 0.3W.I like them because they provide just enough light not to be in complete darkness, yet not too bright so if I have to get up in the middle of the night they don't wake me up to the point it is hard to go back to sleep.

When I originally bought Koolatron P25Koolatron P25 26-Quart FunKool Cooler, Dark GreyI did not buy the pricey AC adapter which is made specificity for Koolatron. That was a mistake. The Radio Shack AC adapter was not powerful enough to handle Koolatron and immediate shut off.The Koolatron Multi-Purpose adaptor, however, works fine! We use it to pre-cool Koolatron before leaving home before the trips (it is a little slow to get cool) and use it in the hotel room when needed.The Koolatron adaptor can be used to both cool and heat for those units who have both heating and cooling option. Which function is working depending on how the adaptor DC plug is connected to the cooler. So when you plug it in check what setting you are using to avoid unpleasant surprises.During the last year the price on this adapter fluctuated between $27 and $34.99. I found a nice tool that allows me to see price history of Amazon items. If you search on Amazon price history and select the one with the word 'camel' you will see the tool I find very useful in my shopping. You can see the history of products and send you an email when the price reaches the level you are interested in.Overall I am pleased with this adapter.Ali Julia review

I bought a Toro Power Showel and I need a 100 feet power cord. I found that the hardest part was not shoveling with the power shovel, but dealing with the power cord. I have a number of back surgeries and problems, and I hoped this electric caddy would make it easier to deal with the cord.The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control and it requires a lot of bending. However I came up with a solution which works beautifully for me. Below is the description of what I came up with along with several customer photos to illustrate the solution I describe below.I used a small water hose caddy to coil the electric cord. I put the electric caddy on a chair, which meant I did not have to bend to coil the cord. One leg of the caddy support is on the chair seat, the second leg of the caddy support is on the back of the chair. The chair provides not only the lift to a convenient height but stability so the caddy does not wiggle when you crank the handle. (picture attached) The electric cord on the caddy felt much lighter and easier to maneuver.I found that the Toro power shovel was stable without having to lean it against a wall when I put it a big plastic storage bin. The caddy with the electrical cord fit nicely on top of the shovel in the bucket (picture attached). This way when I bring in the snow-covered shovel and electric cord the snow melts into the bucket.Update:I found a better solution - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review

I travel with a lot of gadgets that require recharging, so the first thing I check out in a hotel room are the outlets. With Outlets to go I don't have to worry if there are enough and if they are positioned conveniently.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos under customer reviews that I will be referencing in this review.This power strip has a dual-side design, each side has two outlets (Photo #1 and Photo #2 show both each side next to a ruler). The strip if 6 inches long, just under 2 inches wide, and weights 6 oz (photo #5 shows the strip on postal digital scale). The cord is 10.8 inches long (see photo #4) and wraps around the the strip length and plugs into itself when not in use (see photo #3). This makes into small neat bundle without sharp points. All these features make it perfect for taking along when traveling.The outlet on the strip are very well spaced out. Photo #6 shows two of my Sanyo Eneloop recharges side by side fitting perfectly next to each. Photo #7 shows my Samsung Galaxy Tablet charging next to the Sanya Eneloop recharger with plenty of room to spare.This is such a well designed strip that I now use it not only when I travel but also everyday for the rechargers I use every day. I used to do my charging on a circular charging schedule, but with this strip in play I no longer have to worry about the charging schedule.Excellent product! I highly recommend it, and not just for travel!Ali Julia review

I have several set of weights, but use heavy-hands the most.I like Heavy-hands for many reasons1) One set of weights that can be made heavier or lighter as needed. Adding/removing weights is easy, and they take up a lot less room than if you had all those individual weights2) The handles are made out of soft neoprene-like material. It feels good in your hands, they don't calluses. The neoprene material also absorbs any sweat, and thus reduces changes of dropping the weights.3) The shape of the weight has a handle that goes over your hand. This also decreases the chances of one dropping the weights. This shape might also be of help to those with limited finger dexterity.Very good design!

I use rotary blades for decorative cuts used in art quilts. I own both Fiskars and Olfa cutters, as well as several blades for each as I needed a variety of cuts of my artwork. All rotary cutters are used on quilt quality cotton fabrics.Both Fiskars and Olfa provide a high quality rotary cutter, but Olfa appears to require slightly less pressure to create a clean cut. I would attribute it to the sharpness of the blade and possible to the shape of the handle of the cutter itself.I re-sharpen my straight edge rotary blades, however with pinking blades you have to buy new ones as they become dull. A new sharp blade makes work easier!

I use this tape to attach Paypal labels to plastic and paper envelopes, as well as package up cardboard boxes. It works well in both applications. I find it easier to use the tape without a tape applicator. I cut the tape with scissors, and store it with a small glossy paper tab under the end of the tape so it is easy to peel the end of the tape each time.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.This tape is a good bargain. I plan on using it again in the future.

I found this book very helpful as I was learning kayaking. This book covers a large variety of topics with detailed cartoon-like illustrations as well as some photos. I am attaching a sample page from the book to show you what a typical explanation looks like. I found explanations to be a great reminders/re-freshers of the kayaking classes I took on the water. I read the book several times as my skills improved and every time I was able to find something new and useful.Here are the chapters of the book:1. Equipment2. Basic strokes and techniques3. Advanced strokes and techniques4. Surging5. Rescues6. Waves7. Winds and weather8. Tides and tidal streams9. Navigation10. Arctic origins of the sea kayakingThis book is not just a manual for learning how to improve your kayaking technique and tips on outfitting your boat. This book covers kayaking history and shares author's passion for the kayak. I enjoyed every page no matter how many times I read it! I recommend this book.Ali Julia review

I wear glasses when I work at the computer and always get smudges at the bottom of the glasses, as I must be touching them without even knowing it. I notice the annoying smudges because it becomes more difficult to see, so I always have a cleaning cloth next to the computer.This microfiber cloth does a much better job than tissues or terrycloth towels I used before. Once a week or so I wash the glasses with water and dry them with this cloth (they surprisingly absorbent). Otherwise I just wipe the hand oils from my glasses several times a day. These cloths do a nice job cleaning the glasses.If I drop the glasses or get dirt on them other than smudges from my hands I take care to remove grit by washing the glasses to remove the grit to avoid scratching the glasses by pushing it across the glass with the cloth.The cloth is large enough (6 3/4" x 6 3/4") to comfortably put it on both sides of the glasses lens for cleaning. The cloth can be washed. The package includes a pouch. I usually do not use it at the computer, but if I go somewhere where I would need to use my glasses it makes it convenient to put the cloth in my purse.There was only one thing I did not like about this cloth: it comes with a small pouch that does not have flap. Keeping the cloth clean is very important to avoid getting the dirt on it which will scratch the surfaces of the glasses, so I was surprised that it came with such poor pouch. I swapped it with a pouch that came with a polishing cloth for silver that does not get as much use.I am attaching a photo to customer photos which shows the cloth next my reading glasses for size reference.Overall, this cloth does a good job at a decent price.Ali Julia review

I purchased this walker after back surgery and used for every step for several weeks. It was lightweight and with tennis balls on the front feet slid nicely on different surfaces (rugs, hard floors, paved road).One major flaw the the walker had originall is that the foam hand grips were hard, and my hands became raw and red within 10 minutes.However, I came up with a cheap solution. I bought a small piece of black pipe insulation similar toM-D Building Product 50154 Indoor/Outdoor Pipe Insulation - Black (Pack of 40)at the home improvement store, and taped it to the top bars. Not only did it make the grip nice and soft it also increased the area I can use as the grip, and sometimes I held the walker close to me that the original grip position.With this slight improvement I really liked the walker. Although until I came up with this innovation I was very concerned that I would not be able to walk as much as I needed for my exercise after surgery, not because of my back but because my hands would become raw first.

This product lived up to my expectations. It works well, and there is no mess to clean up once it did its job.The way this product works is that you feed the CD through it. CD goes into one side, comes out of the other side. This device scratches CDs with numerous little holes. It does not shred the CD, it makes the data on the CD unreadable. There is no mess, no shards, nothing to clean up. The device is not too loud, and appeared quite durable as I have been using it fore more than 6 months on weekly basis and it has not given me any problems.I tried reading these CDs and DVDs on several computers and it not possible. After running my discs through this, I have no qualms about throwing out my old backup discs.

After my back surgery I am not able to twist and do the wiping the old fashioned way. I learned about this tool in the rehabilitation facility, so to get it right away I had someone purchase it at local Medical Supply store for 2 times as much as Amazon. I wish knew about this tool earlier so I could have bought prior to surgery.No, it does not work as well as doing it with a hand, but it sure beats asking someone else to do it for you.You will have to experiment with various techniques to find what works best for you, prepare to use a lot more toilet paper, many many swipes, and sometimes get your hands dirty. But it does the job.Updated a week later:I decided to buy a second toilet aid so I would have one in each bathroom. I purchasedIdeaworks Long Reach Comfort Wipeand it works much better! It grips the paper better then Self-Wipe, the rubbery head (rather than smooth plastic of Self-Wipe) gives you a better wipe, it uses less toilet paper, you never get your hands dirty because of how the ejection button works.Long Reach is a simpler, cheaper alternative, that is engineered better! Based on the comparison with the other product I am reducing the stars for Self_Wipe from 4 to 3.

I love keeping things organized, and this tool rack really got my basement much better organized.There were a lot of details that I was not sure about when I purchased this unit. To high light these details I am attaching 13 photos organized in 3 photo collages under customer's photos. Each photo has a unique number that I will be referencing in this review.The rack arrived in a huge box which looked a bit intimidating when I first saw it, I was not sure if I will be to carry it all by myself. Photo 1 & 2 show the package next to a chair for size reference. It turned out to be rather light, as the rack itself only took a small part of the box. I had to take it out of the box to carry it down to the basement.Photo 7 shows all the parts before I assembled them. It is best to assembled the rack first, and the flip it and add the coasters. This makes it easier to assembled it. I pounded on each leg (and coasters) with a mallet to make sure there is a good tight fit (Photo 8). Photo 12 and 13 show the lock mechanism for the legs between the two levels of the rack. The lock keeps the legs in the proper orientation for assembly.One thing I could not tell from the photos was the mechanism for holding handles on the front and sides of the rack. Photo #9 and #10 give a good view of them. The U shaped holders are pretty loose and the oval shape holders need to have things inserted from the top. I expected the U-shaped holders to have a squeeze mechanism which some of my other broom holders have. And in order to insert handles from the top you need to have enough clearance above the rack, which was a problem for some longer tools.Photo 11 shows the coasters. Notice that two of them have locks and two of them do not. In order to make locking of the wheels easy and convenient the wheels with locks to onto the front of the side of the rack. The coasters arrived with the locks locked, and all four feels looked almost identical. I read some reviews that mentioned that the rack did not roll well, and I wonder if the locks on coasters remained locked. When locks on the coaster were unlocked I am able to roll the rack pretty easily. When I lock them, it move but with difficulty as only two wheels roll well.Photos 3,4,5,6 show the rack loaded with the tools from different angles. I like the construction of the bottom shelve, it really catches the tools well and keeps them separated. The top has different size holes for different tools, and I found that helpful, but wish there were more big holes.Dimensions:The width (side to side) of the top shelf is 34"The depth (front to back) of the top shelf is 13.5"The width (side to side) of the bottom shelf is 37"The depth (front to back) of the bottom shelf is 20"The rack is 35" (i.e. from the floor to the top of the top shelf)The summary of minor flaws:1. I would have preferred a squeeze mechanism to hold handles on the front and sides.2. Instead of oval holes, I would have preferred some other closure that did not require so much overhead clearance3. I would have preferred more big holes on the top shelveOverall, I am pleased with rack. I find it easy to move around the basement (I keep the coasters unlocked). All my tools fit and I have some room for expansion.Ali Julia review

Gilmore sprinkler gives you a lot of control of how far the water shoots and the shape of the circle. I have been using it now for two weeks, and I am very pleased with its performance. This is my first sprinkler of this type so I got a bit soaked figuring out how to set it up exactly as I wanted, so I am adding detailed instructions and photos of the controls.My goal was to set up a 220 degree semi-circle, leaving a small wedge where I can exit the basement and approach the sprinkler without getting soaked. The distance of how the sprinkler head rotates to the left or the right is control by two red levers around the head. The lever on the RIGHT hand side control how far the head rotates to the LEFT, and the lever on the LEFT hand side controls how far the head rotates to the RIGHT. (see photo)The distance of how far the spray shoots is controlled by a red ring which pushes on the back of the head. The higher the ring is lifted the shorter is the spray, when the ring is at its lowest the water shoots the furthers away. How high the ring is lifted is controlled by the pegs that you can reach beneath the sprinkler (see photo of the sprinkler upside down). When you push on the pegs from below they raise the ring. When you push on the ring from above, you lower the ring. You can control each individual peg, so you have a lot of control and can create a pretty intricate shape for your watering needs.If you need to the sprinkler to make 360 circle, you need to pull the medal clip towards you.I have been watering the newly planted lawn twice a day. The sprinkler is working very well. I am pleased with precision of the watering I was able to achieve avoiding various areas that should not get wet yet getting water to everything I wanted to water.

I am a klutz who does not like stains, so Tide to Go saves the day if used immediately after the "accident".The way I use it is(1) blot the stain with a paper napkin(2) put a paper napkin under the stain(3) take of the cap, and rub the stain from the top(4) blot the stain with a paper napkinRepeat one more time if necessary.I have tried this with beef gravy, wine, soda, tea, ketchup, lipstick. Lipstick was not removed, but it works fairly well on the other stains. It worked equally well on cotton, nylon, and polyester.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.

It appears that some batches of this tape have a problem with stickiness, however the package I bought works well. I use this tape to attach PayPal labels to my packages as well as taping the packages themselves. They work very well, and the clear tape allows me to use paper labels rather than more expensive self-stick labels. What I like about this tape that it is not as thin as some other packaging tapes I tried, so it is easier to control - it lays evenly where I put it and does not stick with bubbles or to itself.Given Amazon's excellent return policy and a statement from the manufacturer that they will remedy the problem (posted as a reply to some of the complaints) this product is worth a try. The chances of someone being stuck with bad tape permanently is not an issue. If you get a good batch this is an excellent, cost effective product.Ali Julia review

I keep it outside during the summer and winter in New England. And survived for 3 years so far. I frankly did not expect it :-) Not too bright, but good enough to light the front steps dimly so I can tell if they are ice covered or not. Wish they can be brighter.

The subject of the book is compelling and important. Loving many of John Grisham books in the past, I expected to to love this book based on the summary and the author. However, I have not been able to finish the book on two attempts. It read like a newspaper article more than a novel,and when another book turned up I was eager to switch to it without forcing myself to finish this one.

My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters. These toe sleeves did not work for me. They slipped off the toe, they were not comfortable. After trying it for about a week I threw them out.I found a better solution that works for me. I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formula - .45 ozto put between my toes. They now glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don't have any blisters.This saved me a lot of pain, I wish I knew of it earlier. I hope this solution will help someone else with a similar problem.Ali Julia review

The product description says "Winds 100 feet of cord in 30 seconds". I don't think that is possible. Perhaps if the cord came straight from the store (never used) and was laid out perfectly straight in front of the crank for its entire length and the person doing the cranking was a strong armed athlete... But the cord that has been in use and acquired some kinks (as they all do) will take much longer. And if the cord was outside in the cold weather which makes the cord stiffer it would take significantly longer.I bought the winder for 100 feet electric cord I use to power a Toro power shovel. Last winter when I was just coming back from back surgery dealing with the cord was harder on my back then pushing the power shovel. I needed to find a better solution than winding it around my elbow. This crank is likely to take me 10 minutes to wind the cord into the net, but for me it is worth it because even though it is not as easy as advertised it is still easier on my back than winding it around my elbow. And once cord is in the net it is neater than the loose bundle that I create by coiling it around my arm.I am attaching several photos to the customer photos for this product (visible if you click on customer photos under the stock photo).The winder came in 8 parts (see photo 2) and a long sheet of instructions. It was fairly easy to assemble and install. I am not very handy yet it took me only about 15 minutes. The instructions for the assembly and operation were clear. The unit protrudes 11 inches from the wall, plus it is installed onto a mount which is 1.5 inches. So you need a total clearance of 12.5 inches. The width of the unit is 2.5 inches. Photo #1 shows the mounted winder.The mount has 4 mounting holes. The instructions are to attach the mount using the two horizontal holes. But the stud where I wanted to mount the winder was not wide enough to use both of those holes. So I mounted it using the top hole and one of the horizontal holes. So far this mount appears to have sufficient stability for the crank to work.The unit comes with two mounting bracket. I plan to put one mount outside but I have doubts that the winder will work on the cold stiff cord, given than it was difficult to coil a warm pliable cord. I suspect that after using the power shovel I will have to bring in the cord uncoiled, have it warm up, and then coil inside the house.Update: The winder worked ok. It did slip some and required a bit of guiding by hand so it was not fast, but easier on my back than winding the long cord without it.When you mount the bracket locate it at a height where the crank of the unit is at a comfortable level to crank it. When you coil the cord you will need both hands. As you crank with one hand, the other hand will be pushing on the lever that pushes the cord against the drive wheel. (Photo #3 shows where the cord goes between the level and the coiling wheel). If the cord does not stay in the center of the wheel, the wheel does not grab it and the cord does not coil (Photo #3 is taken from above and shows a good view of the cranking mechanism.)I am a bit disappointed that it took quite a bit of work to get 100 feet of the cord into the net. As you see in the photo#1 100 feet filled the net pretty much to the top, I am not sure how 150 feet cord would fit into the net. The mechanism that pushes the cord against the wheel seems to be the weakest point of the winder, as the cord often slips and needs to be readjusted. But overall it did work, so I am ranking it as 3 star "OK".Ali Julia review

This stuff works fantastic. I have a lot of black bumpers on my car, and after applying this the car really looks like new. It makes a bigger difference than I expected. You do need to reapply it every few months or so to keep the effect going.

I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with. I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait. I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine. It is easy and pleasant to work with. I highly recommend it.

High quality plastic transparent sleeves for baseball card sized content. This listing is selling individual sleeves not pages with multiple sleeves on each page. The sleeves come in a zip-lock bag which is handy for storing empty sleeves. The bags are soft with a little bit of stiffness.Each sleeve is sized 2 5/8 X 3 5/8, so any 2.5" x 3.5" mini art fits nicely with a little room to spare. I am attaching a photo under customer images with a sleeve out of the package next to the ruler for reference.I am an artist that sells my own art work, some of my pieces are artist trade cards (ACEO) which are the size of the baseball card. I sell them packaged in these sleeves and they look very professional. The sleeves protect the art from elements and finger prints. So these nice sleeves are not just for baseball cards!I am pleased with the quality of these sleeves and the price at 2.6 cents per sleeve is very reasonable. I would buy them again.Ali Julia review

After back surgery I was not able to bend and had trouble with such basics as putting on my socks. I got this sock aid but only used it a few times. It works on very stretchy socks only, and stretches them even more.I found that a short UNGER The Nifty Nabber 18" worked better by grabbing the top of the sock without having to put the whole thing into the sock.

I love these mailers. They are waterproof, sturdy, and close very securely. I attach labels to them with transparent package tape, and they hold the tape very well. They perform better than Tyvek envelopes in every respect.Unfortunately, some post offices charge a 20 cent surcharge for processing poly mailers. But they are sill worth it!

The taste of this coffee candy is terrific - not too sweet, not too strong, just perfect.The amount you get in this $5+ package is 32 candies. Each candy is the size of 3 nickels stacked on top of each other. Total weight of all candies in this package is 4.23 oz (120 grams).The taste met my expectation, the amount of candies I received did not.Update: Kopiko candy inspired me to investigate other Asian Coffee Candies. If you like Kopiko I recommend that you also tryBali's Best Coffee Candy, 5.3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12).Bali's Best has a slight stronger coffee taste compared to Kopiko Cappuccino flavor, and just slightly sweeter. Both are fine candy, but Bali's Best is a much better deal. See my review of Bali's Best Coffee Candy for details.

I love to sew and quilt, so I have always done a lot of ironing and went through a number of irons in my past. In the past I purchased fairly cheap irons (under $50) and thought they were all the same. Finally, when my last iron broke I treated myselt to Rowenta Focus - oh wow, what a difference! I wish I have done it earlier.What I like1) Rowenta iron removes the deepest wrinkles on cotton and linen in one swipe2) It can be used vertically to remove wrinkles from curtains3) It allows you to adjust the amount of steam delivered4) It has burst of steam feature5) It has water spray feature6) You can turn off steam when you don't need it7) It is easy to use all the features8) It feels good in your hand, good ergonomic designThis is a great iron!

I use my rotary cutter for quilting fabric, cutting photographic paper, cutting regular paper, so I use a lot of blades! Rotary blade sharpener saves me a lot of money by letting me use each blade for a long time. I have re-sharpened each blade at least 10 times each. I see improved cutting (for example, on fabric you stop getting a few threads that did not get cut on the first stroke).To sharpen the blade, you to disassemble the rotary cutter, which has a number of pieces including the blade. Then you have to take the blade in your hand and place into the sharpener. You sharpen by rotating the two pieces of the sharper against each other. After the sharpening you have to move the blade back to the rotary cutter, and then reassemble the rotary cutter correctly (one has to remember how pieces fit together exactly).Recently I discovered a sharpener that works without having to remove the blade from the cutter. It works by using the same motion as you cut, by moving the cutter in the sharpener itself. Not having to remove the blade from the sharpener is a *huge* advantage. It is faster, less chance of cutting yourself, and no chance of assembling the rotary cutter the wrong way (been there, done that).TrueCut Rotary Blade SharpenerBoth rotary cutters work well, generate equally good results, prolong the life your blades, and thus save you money.

I like keeping my crafts organized and find this organizer very helpful. Overall I am satisfied with it.I am attaching a photo collage of 3 photos which I will be referencing in this review.The organizer arrived with no protective packaging, no instructions, and no mounting hardware.I did not see any dividers in the package. Only when I was taking photos for this review did I notice that the back of the organizer has plastic dividers molded in the back, so if you want dividers you can cut them off. Since the organizer draws fall out when you tilt the organizer forward you need to remove the dividers before you fill the compartments with stuff. See photo #3 to see the photo of the back of the organizer. Note that the number of the dividers are much smaller than the number of compartments.As I mentioned earlier the organizer came without any mounting hardware. The spacing between mounting holes is 18 inches, so you cannot place both holes into studs spaced 16 inches apart. Photo #2 shows the hardware I purchased separately to mount the organizer on hollow walls. #8-10x1" bolts with anchors worked well.There is a total of 24 compartments. Photo #1 shows a close-up of one of the draws with a pen inside for size reference. The compartments are 4.5" wide, 5.5" long and 2" deep.The compartments can be taken out fairly easily which I find that handy when I need to use the content. I wish the compartments were a little longer (6" would have been perfect). Akro-Mils makes several versions of this organizer: one with all small compartments, one with all large compartments, and one half large and half small compartments.I LIKED:1. Organizer is helpful to keep small items orderly2. Wall mounting saves space, I placed behind the door in a wasted space otherwise3. Each bin can be easily taken out and put backI DID NOT LIKE:1. No mounting hardware, no template for making holes in the wall2. No instructions - I noticed dividers just by chance because I was writing this review and taking photos3. Would have preferred slightly longer compartments (6 inches rather than 5.5 inches)Overall, I am pleased and would buy this organizer again if I had to do it over again.Ali Julia review

OMG! This is heaven! Dark creamy chocolate with slivers of almond and orange zest. This is an intense chocolate experience. Someone gave me a taste at work, and I just ordered a dozen so I can have it all to myself!It has an exquisite taste!Updated 5/12/11I came back to order another batch, when I saw that the price went from $27(eligible for free shipping) on 3/17/11 to $47 plus shipping.

I could not. These seconds go for 10 bars for $15. Can't beat that for a totally amazing chocolate.Ali Julia review

My significant other stores, so I have to sleep with ear plugs every night. I noticed that my ears itch significantly less when I use Murine ear wax removal every 6 months or so. I put a couple of drops in each ear, then watch TV for about 10 minutes with my head bent to the side, then wash each ear out of provided syringe ball. I fill white bowl of water with warm water and wash my ear over it, letting my ears drain into the bowl. This allows me to see what is being washed out. It tells me how well the system is cleaning my ears.The system works well, my ears clear from wax and water easily. My hearing is more clear after the washing, and the ear canals don't each even with daily use of the ear plugs. I recommend it!Ali Julia review

Kotex Lightday Pantiliners are the best quality panty liner out there. I have tried several other brands only to come back to Kotex. It sticks well, yet easy to remove. It does not bunch up. It has good absorbency. I very much appreciated that it is unscented. I also like that this liner is slightly longer than the regular size.This packaging is the best deal value - 6 cents per liner. Yes, you get 6 large boxes, but they don't go bad :-)Bottom line: this is the best value and the best quality.

I purchased several pieces of Cuisinart bake ware when it was on sale in a local cooking store. They looked beautiful on the shelve and the silicon grips looked like a great idea.Unfortunately, in practice, I had a problem with each piece of bake ware.1. The silicon grips began disintegrate on first use. After the first use I found a blank rubbery chunk in the oven and I could not figure out where it came from. When I was washing the baking sheet I saw that the bottom part of the silicon handle was disintegrating. I would not even call it melting, it was just coming apart. I believe the first usage was at 375F. The second time I use it was at 450F. And one side totally melted fell out when I wash washing the baking sheet.I am attaching a photo (under customer photos in the top left of the main page) with the melted handle so you can see what happened to it.2. The surface of the baking sheet began having brown spots that I am not able to remove.3. When I baked a pie using this sheet to catch any spill over, the metal twisted from moving the pie dish to one side to the very edge of the sheet. This caused a spill to miss the sheet and get on to the oven itself.I had similar problems with the other Cuisinart bake ware pieces I bought at the same time. I am surprised and disappointed. Cuisinart name used to mean high quality to me. That's why I was willing to pay a premium price for the items. But this time the higher price was not worth it.Ali Julia review

I love Indian food and when I discovered Patak's cooking sauces it al-lowed me have delicious Indian food at home with very little effort. I am am able to get 3 or 4 dinners out of one jar container.I use this Vindaloo paste as a base and add the following ingredients: coconut milk, fresh cilantro, and garlic.I typically make either chicken or lamb cut up in small pieces. I also often add vegetable into the same pan, potatoes and onions work very well. Sometimes I also like adding broccoli, cauliflower or chickpeas for variety.The best price for this sauce I found in a local Indian store. They have a very large variety of Patak's sauces: different flavors and different hotness. I usually buy a large variety and store unopened jars in the basement. They keeps very well for a long time.I have tried a variety of Indian cooking sauces and Patak's is my favorite.Ali Julia review

I have subscribed to Pop Photo for many years and find something interesting in every issue. There are some how-to articles and tips and reviews of new equipment. About 1/3 of the magazine is ads, which are often interesting to flip through. I usually find at least one article or feature of interest as a "keeper". So I tear out those few pages out of the magazine and have a folder of interesting articles that is easy for me to find without keeping the entire magazine. Given the very reasonable price I think finding one keeper article in each issue, and enjoying reading/flipping through the rest makes the subscription worth the price.

I am fairly new to quilling - this is my second book on quilling and I have done about 4 projects - and this book a tremendous inspiration. The gallery of projects is breathtaking and shows images I could have never imagined to be possible with quilling. The explanations are clear, and the project have different level of complexity, so I can start with something at my current level and improve as I get more practice.The first 14 pages of this book cover basic techniques, with clear words and detailed photos. Pages 16 through 66 are projects, which include explanation, templates, photos, and tips. The projects cover not only cards and wall hanging, but earrings, brooches and necklaces. Pages 68 through 77 are gallery photos of completed projects. The last two pages are bibliography of contributing artists.Quilling is easy to learn and does not require a large investment in specialized tools. I started by using paper I use my ink jet printer and cut into thin strips manually with scissors. Then used the tip from the first quilling book I readThe New Paper Quilling: Creative Techniques for Scrapbooks, Cards, Home Accents & Moreto use my paper shredder to generate paper strips faster.To twirl the paper I used a big eye needle I use for sewing. I first started with using the needle as is and just twirling it in my hand. Then looking at the photos in the book the book I made an improve and snipped of the eye tip with wire cutters so it was easier to disengage the needle from paper. Then I added a handle to my tool by sticking a needle into a small dowel and giving it a couple of light taps so was well embedded in the wood. If ou prefer you can buy a tool like that in a craft store, but I really enjoyed being able to create my own tools out of what I already have on hand.It takes just a bit of practice to get nice scrolls going. The book gave me a lot of nice idea of shapes and projects to try, starting with easier and then getting more intricate. Malinda Johnston has a lot of experience quilling and a way of sharing her experience in an easy to understand way.Between the two quilling books I read so far, this one has more projects that excited me. I really enjoyed Paper Quilling by Malinda Johnston and looking forward to making a number of projects from this book.Ali Julia review

Sulky thread is my favorite thread - it has a wonderful texture when the work is completed, and I often get compliments on my completed pieces which I am sure at least partially can be attributed to this wonderful thread.It is easy to work with and does not get torn easily. I use it for both quilting and embroidery as the top thread (using another matching in color thread in the bobbin to cut down on overall cost).This is one of my favorite vari-light colors, the shades of yellow-to-brown blend beautifully. It makes wonderful fall leaves color in my art quilts!

The Samsung ML-2010 is a personal monochrome laser that delivers high-quality output and good speed and does so for a reasonable price. And it lasts! I have owned ML-2010 for 5 years and it is still going strong without giving me any problems. Paper jams very rarely and when it does it are very easy to fix. The laser cartridges are very easy to replace.The price of the printer itself is very low, the cost comes from the laser cartridges. The "starter" cartridge that comes with a printer is low capacity and lasted 8 months with average use of printing 4-5 pages a day. The full capacity laser cartridge lasted 1 year and 5 months with the same print rate. I 5 years of daily use I am on my second full cartridge looking to buy the third.When the print becomes uneven (i.e. lighter in one area) you can get a few more weeks of the cartridge by shaking it and reinserting back in. I typically order the new cartridge from Amazon when this uneven print happens. I get it in time to replace with some time to spare.The two cartridges I purchased so far were original new Samsung OEM cartridges.

At the time I purchased these replacement spools the official Amazon description listed only GrassHog NST2018 as compatible model. I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground. The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9. The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches, if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall, I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers!Ali Julia review

I have owned Canon Pixma IP6600D printer for a number of years. It is durable and have not given me any problems. The quality of the photos is good. It is also handles thicker paper I use for my other craft hobbies.One of the features I like most is iP6600D has versatile paper-feeding options. I use the top feader for regular letter size paper, and I use the bottom feeder for photo paper. This way I can have different stock paper ready to go just by switching the feeder button.Switching cartridges is easy. I like that the there is light indicator on each cartridge which tells you when the cartridge is empty (fast blink) and when the ink is low (slow blink).The feature I never use is the LCD screen on the printer. It is so much easier to control everything sitting in a comfortable chair in front of the PC.Overall, I am very pleased with the printer - its durability and quality of photos.The main cost of the printer comes from the cost of the ink cartridges.. The cost of each individual ink cartridge ranges from around $12.50-15 (on Amazon) to 18.99 in Staples. So no matter how you buy the genuine Canon Ink Cartridges keeping yourself ready to print photos is expensive.You can get a better per cartridge of you buy them inCanon CLI-8 4-Color Multipack Ink Tanks. In that case each individual cartridge is a little less expensive. Canon package CL-8C (Cyan), CL-8M (Magenta), CL-8Y (Yellow), and CL-8BK (Black) as a pack ($40-44 on Amazon). When cartridges are sold in packs you might think those colors are used at similar rates... but that is not so.I have kept track of the usage of the cartridges over a long period of time and would like to share these results with you.Number of cartridges usedCL-8M Magenta = 5CL-8Y Yellow = 8CL-8B Black = 6CL-8PC Photo Cyan = 6CL-8PM Photo Magenta = 8CL-8C Cyan = 4My usage shows that yellow is used the most, followed closely by Photo Magenta, followed next by Black and Photo Cyan, and trailed by Cyan and Magenta.

However now that Staples began (again) accepting CL-8 cartridges for Staples Rewards in their recycling empty cartridges program, I wanted to analyze my usage to see which cartridges I should buy at Staples using my Staples Rewards.My original thought was to buyCanon CLI-8PC Photo Cyan Ink TankandCanon CLI-8PM Photo Magenta Ink Tanksince they don't come in a pack. But given the usage chart above, it is clear that I should buy extra Yellow and Photo Magenta.

I decided to give myself a touch of luxury and bought myself these padded hangers. Typically I thought of these as most useful for lingerie but I wound up using them for my sweaters and knits. The best thing about them that they don't stretch out the shoulders. They are sturdy and hold a long fairly heavy sweater/coat without bending. As a nice side benefit the hangers are pretty and when I open my closet and I see a bit of their color it makes me feel good.I recommend these hangers!Ali Julia review

I brought this monitor to my doctor's office for comparison with their measurements and found that the top number was lower by than the doc's measurements, and the lower number is higher by 10 than the doc's measurements. They have done this calibration several times, in different positions (sitting, standing, laying) and the difference remained. This was disappointing.However being able to monitor day-to-day changes is still helpful, I just have to make mental adjustments for calibration if I want to know the real pressure.So on the positive side1) Ability to monitor day to day changes is useful2) It is relative easy to put on one handed3) Works on standard AA rechargeable batteries4) Has a clear display with large numbers5) Has a setting that allows you to measure other people's blood pressure without effecting the record that is stored for youThe only negative is the accuracy I mentioned earlier in the review. Unfortunately, it is a biggy. I suggest that you bring your monitor to your next appointment for calibration so you will know how to adjust the reading.

This is an excellent book with clear explanations and interesting projects. I am relatively new to beading and picked up this book in the library to learn how to add clasps correctly. This book is great. It had terrific section on techniques. In the table of content below you see that there is a lengthy chapter on techniques. It helped me solve the issue I was having with clasps. In addition the book has a lot of interesting projects, in particularly I enjoyed the section on weaving necklaces techniques (I am attaching an example under Customer Photos). It gave me a lot of new ideas and showed me the tools that will help me get the job done better and quicker.This book has 127 pages, lots of images, and clear explanations. It has a nice index at the end, which helps to find a specific topic. The projects are suitable for new and experience beader, some are quick and some a lengthy.

These sleeves are exactly what I was looking for1) They are plastic rather paper, so you can see through them. The plastic is slightly smoky in color2) They are double sided (i.e. each sleeve can take two cds)3) The divider between the two sides is slightly fuzzy material, so it is non-slip4) They fit CDs well (not too snug, so CDs are easy to take out)5) Good sturdy qualityI recommend this product!

This large container is 3" x 5" x 6", it is perfect for cooking and baking for chocoholics like me!I like:1. This powder has rich yet delicate chocolate flavor2. 100% cocoa3. It is unsweetened, so you can control how sweet the final result is4. Economical size, best per oz price if you use a lot of chocolate powderI don't like:Nothing!There are two types of unsweetened cocoa powder: Dutch-processed and Natural. Natural cocoa is an acid. Dutch-processed cocoa is treated with an alkali to neutralize the acid. As a result Dutch-processed cocoa is has more delicate chocolate flavor and no bitterness, while Natural cocoa power has more intense deeper chocolate flavor with a bit of bitterness.Note that this why (its neutrality) Dutch-Processed Coca Powder does not react with baking soda, it must be used in recipes with baking powder.I found that I enjoy some bitterness when I eat a good chocolate bar or a brownie, but I prefer not to have that bit of bitterness when I eat a chocolate cake.

I use the edgers for creating my own post cards and thank you cards. I love this set of paper cutters. It is great to have such a nice variety of edges in this set, allows me to create a lot of unique cards.These Edgers are high quality and they are sharp. I always get a clean cut on the first attempt whether I cut thin paper or heavier card stock.I have small hands and they are comfortable to use, but the holes are smaller than regular size scissors, so if you have large hands that is something to keep in mind. The thumb opening is 3/4 of inch wide and 1 inch long.Overall, I am very pleased with the scissors and would recommend them.Ali Julia review

I have a couple of Scrushes at my house. The one with the base is at the entrance that has stone steps, and the one without the base at the entrance that has wood steps. The Scrusher with a base allows you to put one foot on the base to hold it down, while you are cleaning the other shoe. The Scrusher without the base has to screwed down to the deck to stay in place while you are using it.I am attaching a photo which shows the Scrusher on an angle that demonstrates all its brushes. It scrapes the boot from the sides as well as from the bottom. It works well on scraping off garden dirt during the summer as well as snow during the winter. The stiff brushes do a good job cleaning without damaging/scratching the shoe.I owned my Scrushes for 3 years, they stay outside all year round. The only down side is that metal parts began rusting on both of them, so I had to move the Scrusher off the nice stone steps to avoid rusty stains. However the replacement steel base is sold separately so it can be replaced (to find the base search for Scrusher Boot Cleaner Base (Steel Base Only!))I am attaching several photos of my Scrusher, so you can evaluate its condition and the amount of rust yourself.Ali Julia review

After several surgeries on my back I have trouble walking for a long time without sitting down to release the stress on my back by sitting down for a few minutes. I purchased this chair so I would be able to walk without having to worry that I would have no place to sit down.This chair is almost perfect. It has only one major flaw. Both the flaw and the solution to the problem are detailed in the second half of the review.My review will be referencing several photo collages that I attached under customer photos. Each photo is numbered 1 through 7.The chair turned out to be more comfortable and more stable than I imagined from the photos. I sit on it as I would sit on a bicycle seat (see photo #6). Imagine that the top part of the photo is the pointy end of the bicycle seat, so my butt is on the wide part and it feels pretty comfortable. Not armchair comfortable but not unpleasant.The slacker chair is pretty light. Photo #4 shows it on the postal scale, and you can see that it comes in at 1 pound 14.1 oz. Photos #5 shows the construction of the seat. Photos #7 show the feet. The feet generate pretty good friction and don't slide.The chair is 24" long when folded. and when I wrap my measuring tape around its width the circumference is 7". When it is open, the seat is 17" from the ground. I am short and I find that height very comfortable. My husband thinks it is a little too short but not bad (he said it was like sitting on a toilet).So now, the big flaw. What makes this chair valuable to me is the ability to carry it around. I need it to be very comfortable to carry around. However the strap is too short to comfortably carry it over my shoulder even for small person like myself. And what I really wanted is carry it like a sling across my back. I want it rests on my back and be totally out of the way.Photo 1 through 4 show my solutions to this problem.The strap before alternations is 21.5 inches long. The distance before anchors for the strap is 19". So you get only a couple of inches of slack. This lack of slack is the problem. To fix this problem, I cut the strap (see photo #1) and extended it with a regular black strap you can buy at any craft store.The key to working with these straps is to singe the edges of them so they don't unravel. The strapping material does not burn, it melts. This forms a protective coating on the edges so you don't need to worry about them coming apart. Also it allows you to connected the two straps with minimum bulk, you don't need to fold them under. You see a close-up of the treated edge in photo #2.After singing all 4 ends I connected the two straps with my sewing machine. I made the strap long enough to be comfortable for both myself and my husband, which required doubling its original size. I can make the strap shorter by feeding the access strapping material into the buckle. I also attached an extra Velcro strip in case I wanted to tuck away the dangling strap while I am sitting in a chair and not bother with the buckle.With this simple fix the slacker chair is absolutely perfect! I can now take long walks like I did before my back problems.Ali Julia review

Hempseed flavor reminds me of pine nuts. Hempseed contain all nine essential amino acids, which makes them a complete protein, like egg whites and soy. One ounce of hemp provides 45 percent of daily magnesium requirement. Studies show that a diet rich in magnesium can slash diabetes risk by almost half, because it increases insulin sensitivity.My favorite way to eat hempseed is as a dip or a spread on a sandwich. I use the same recipe for both. I puree 1 Tbsp. ground hemp seeds, 2 Tbsp. store-bought pesto, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 can cannellini beans.Hempseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the seeds into the container.In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.FLAXSEEDSNutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.HEMP SEEDSSimilar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.BUCKWHEAT GROATSSoft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.WHEAT GERMThe flaky center of wheat kernels. Very light earthy flavor.Ali Julia review

The main reason I was looking for a new pill organizer is that the old one I have been using became too small to hold all the pills I need to take. I looked at all organizers offered on Amazon but was not totally clear on the size of each organizer as exact dimensions of each compartment were not given. This pill box seemed like it might work and the price was reasonable. This turned out to be a very good choice!The inside dimensions of each compartment are:1.5" long x 1" wide x 1" depthThe outside dimensions of the entire pill box (14 containers):7.25" long x 2.5" wide x 1.25" heightI am attaching a photo of the container with the large 600 mg Calcium pills at the bottom of one compartment. You can see that I was able to fit 4 of them in one layer at the bottom of the compartment.So I liked:1. Very roomy2. Closes well3. Opens smoothly4. Each lid is marked with a day of the week plus 'am' or 'pm'5. AM and PM sides have different colors another aid in remembering what pills you already took and which ones you need to takeThis pill box totally met all my requirements. I am fully satisfied and recommend this product to others.

This pill splitter works very well. The area where the pill is positioned is rubbery so the pill does not move. The splitter can handle different shapes of the pills. I had triangular pills which it handled as well as round one, as well as tubes. Once the pill is cut it can be dropped into a lower compartment, this means you can cut multiple pills until removing them from the splitter. This is a well-designed product that does exactly what it supposed to do.

Lowpro Orion has been my main photo bag for a number of years. It is well designed, has good, high quality and durable construction. I like the belt option because it is easy to carry the weight of the camera, while leaving your hands free.This bag takes two lens pouch extensions. In this combination I can fit a camera, two lenses, a large selection of filters, spare batteries, lens cleaning fluid kit, and still have room left for my wallet, glasses, headlamp, bug spray. This bag can be used both as a belt bag and as a shoulder bag. When you use the should strap, the belt straps can be easily hidden out of the way. The reverse is also true. The designers really thought it all through.Sometimes I use one of the lens pouches as a water bottle carrier instead of an extra lens. It is very durable. I've used this bag for years, rain and shine, and it still looks good - no signs of wear despite every week usage.One drawback of having a big bag in the front, especially with lens pouch extensions attached, you cannot see the ground right in front of your feet. When you are hiking this can be a problem. However, when I was going down hill I would turn this bag into a fanny pack, but turning it around. However then I had no easy access to the camera/filters.I recently switched to using Lowpro SlingShot as my main bag and I like it better mainly for that reason. The camera bag is behind you, but access to it is easy. I still use Orion bag as a backup bag, and still have times when I prefer it.When I travel, I found that I can fit both the Slingshot and the Orion bags into one carry-on bag, this way all my camera gear can some with me on the plane.

This clothline is made out of three braids of rubber, which can be pulled apart to poke through a small piece of the garment you want to dry. This means you don't need to worry about cloth pins when you travel. This clothline works very well indoors, however the rubber braids are not strong enough to hold clothing outside in the wind or near an open window with strong gusts.The length of this rope without stretching is 40 inches. Each end of the rope ends in a Velcro loop which I did not include in the 40 inch measurement as it will be tied around something. The stretchy part is 32 inches, and can be relatively easily stretch to 42 inches giving you a total of 48 inches. However, I would not stretch it any more than that as I ran into issues: either the pull moves the objects it is tied to (when I use two chairs) or the Velcro undoes itself. I was also worried about pulling out the rope ends from the rubber part and ruining the rope. My solution to a relatively short length is to pack a short rope with a loop on one end. When I need extra reach to tie the clothline I attach the Velcro tie to the loop of the rope. This extension gives me the extra length to reach another stationary object when needed.I am attaching a photo (which can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo) which shows a close-up of the rope with a pen sticking through the braids to demonstrate how it stretches. You can also see how solidly the Velcro ties are constructed. They are quite thick.When I travel I always wash my items in the sink. This allows me to bring fewer clothes as well as have a minimum amount of dirty underwear in the luggage. Most things I have dry over night. Typically hiking socks are the only things that remain damp. This becomes a problem if you are moving from place to place, so I carry a spare plastic bag where the items that are not totally dry travel if we are switching hotel rooms. To do the laundry I use the shampoo (either the hotel's or the travel bottle I bring myself if we travel in places which do not provide toiletries).I found having this travel rope makes laundry on the go easier, and I don't need to worry about forgetting to bring cloth pins or using up all hangers for hanging laundry instead of cloth.Ali Julia review

I heard of many benefits of Fish Oil, but have not gotten around to taking it until recently.I have dry eyes that require me to put drops in several times a day. At its worse my eyes were so dry that I had trouble opening my eyelids in the morning, they were stuck to my eyes.On my last visit, my doctor suggested that I try taking 2 triple omega oil pills a day, as he found it really helps eye dryness. I was skeptical, but figured I would give it a try since fish oil has other positive effects. 2 weeks later I really began feeling a difference, my eyelids are no longer stuck to my eyes in the morning. I still use Refresh eye drops, it just does not feel as urgent when I wake up.Update 12/30/12It has been over a year since I began taking the fish oil pills, the good effect on my dry eyes continues. That was the only change I have made and my eyes continue to need less eye drops.Ali Julia review

I have accumulated a number of devices that take 9 volt batteries (carbon monoxide detectors, water timers, backup battery for clocks). I used to buy 9 volt battery in Walmart and they were pretty expensive ($4-5) and lasted only a few months. Then I switched to Rayovac 9 vol rechargeable. After the initial investment they were cheaper to use but they lasted a very short time, I had to switch the batteries in my water timers once a month to avoid getting my plants having to tell me the battery was dead by wilting. A month ago my 9 volt recharger broke and I decided to go back to non-rechargeable batteries. These Duracell Procell batteries are a real bargain by comparison to the two options I used before if they last more than a couple of month each. I will post an update how they are in my devices in a few months.I am attaching a photo under customer photos which shows the package with batteries. Each battery comes with a cap that covers the connectors. The connectors were a little tight, I had to work to get the battery to connect but after a few tries it fit.So far so good! I will be back with an update on longevity.Ali Julia reviewUpdate 2/12/2013. The water timers made it through the entire summer with one battery. Carbon monoxide detector is still running on the first battery and does not complain that battery is low. The clock (which runs on battery only when power is down) is still on its first battery with two power outages behind us.

Written in 1899, this book talks different ways human memory works and how to improve your ability to memorize.Assimilative memory is absorbing of ideas and making them available for recall whenever wanted. It is learning through through grasping the ideas meaning and comprehension of the subject matter.It is contrasted with Sensuous memory which is association through eye or ear of succession of sights or sounds without any reflection. It is learning by repetition, this is not a mode of learning that is lasting.These two methods of learning are illustrated by example memorizing a series of words. One by repeating the words over and over, another by thinking of relationships between the words.The author's premise is that thinking of the relationships between the words makes it easier to memorize the wordsand retrieve them later.The authors method of memorization is based on the three laws are : Inclusion, Exclusion, and Concurrences. The book goes through various example of three laws of forming relationship between words, numbers in improving memorization. Then it progress to more complex examples such as sentences, poems, foreign words.The book contains a larger number of exercises, starting with simple and ending with quite complex.Some of the ideas in this book must have been ground breaking at the time they were written. They are still interesting and relevant today.Ali Julia review

Gilmour solid brass connector is solidly built. It comes with lifetime warranty replacement policy. Even though I am unlikely to use the warranty as the cost of shipping is going to similar to the cost of the new device, it is nice to know that the company has high degree of confidence in their product.This hose connector has been in use for a month, and so far I had no problems with it. Opens and shuts well, one connector is permanently open and is on the timer. None of the connections leak. This is my third brass hose connector from Gilmour. The first two (all brass, including knobs) still work as well as the when they were brand new. No leaks! I hope to get the same level of performance from this 4-way connector.This connector has plastic knobs rather than all brass than some of the other Gilmour four way Manifold has several versions. Now that I had a chance to use both all brass and all plastic versions, I like the all brass version slightly better. When you need to open a tightly closed connector the plastic one is harder to turn as it has more "give". These knobs feel like a weak point. If I was to do it over again, I would go with all brass unit.This connector came with a mounting bracket. After several back surgeries I always look for ways to make things easier on my back. This manifold is not mounted on the faucet (which is very low and requires me to bend). Rather I connected a 4 foot hose to the 4 way brass hose connector which is resting on a flower caddy which higher and easier to reach. I used the mounting bracket to secure the connector to the caddy so it does not fall off.A few things I do that might helps to get the top performance from my hose connectors:1. I use Teflon tape on every connections2. I take connectors and hoses indoors during the winterA photo of the manifold on the caddy is attached under customer photos at the top of the listing.Ali Julia review

I bought this set as a gift for friend who is ridiculously huge Seinfield fan. I love the show, he however can quote entire episodes from memory. This is a review of the DVD set product, not the show itself.Overall, my friend was very pleased with the DVD set, the quality of the video is very good. This gift box set including season's 1,2, and 3 and also includes bloopers, deleted scenes, and interviews. There us an to "Play All" or selecting individual episodes, which is a nice feature that allows you to go to your favorite episodes.In terms of extra material, it was interesting to see some of the inspiration for the show. For example, Larry David interviews his neighbor who was the inspiration for Kramer character. The resemblance of the two characters is uncanny. My friend also mentioned that he enjoyed the insight that the pop-up text that comes with each show gave him.Some box-set extra bonus stuff was a bit of a disappointment, the salt and shaker/napkin holder are miniatures not something you can really use (he wanted to). The desk of cards was ok. The script with handwritten notes by Larry David was interesting.This this was a gift, I did not see the entire set, but the ortions of the DVD we watched together I really enjoyed. More significantly my friend loved it. If you are looking for a gift for Seinfield fan, this sure to be a hit!

After several surgeries on my back I have trouble walking for a long time without sitting down to release the stress on my back by sitting down for a few minutes. I purchased this chair so I would be able to walk without having to worry that I would have no place to sit down.This chair is almost perfect. It has only one major flaw. Both the flaw and the solution to the problem are detailed in the second half of the review.My review will be referencing several photo collages that I attached under customer photos. Each photo is numbered 1 through 7.The chair turned out to be more comfortable and more stable than I imagined from the photos. I sit on it as I would sit on a bicycle seat (see photo #6). Imagine that the top part of the photo is the pointy end of the bicycle seat, so my butt is on the wide part and it feels pretty comfortable. Not armchair comfortable but not unpleasant.The slacker chair is pretty light. Photo #4 shows it on the postal scale, and you can see that it comes in at 1 pound 14.1 oz. Photos #5 shows the construction of the seat. Photos #7 show the feet. The feet generate pretty good friction and don't slide.The chair is 24" long when folded. and when I wrap my measuring tape around its width the circumference is 7". When it is open, the seat is 17" from the ground. I am short and I find that height very comfortable. My husband thinks it is a little too short but not bad (he said it was like sitting on a toilet).So now, the big flaw. What makes this chair valuable to me is the ability to carry it around. I need it to be very comfortable to carry around. However the strap is too short to comfortably carry it over my shoulder even for small person like myself. And what I really wanted is carry it like a sling across my back. I want it rests on my back and be totally out of the way.Photo 1 through 4 show my solutions to this problem.The strap before alternations is 21.5 inches long. The distance before anchors for the strap is 19". So you get only a couple of inches of slack. This lack of slack is the problem. To fix this problem, I cut the strap (see photo #1) and extended it with a regular black strap you can buy any craft store.The key to working with these straps is to singe the edges of them so they don't unravel. The strapping material does not burn, it melts. This forms a protective coating on the edges so you don't need to worry about them coming apart. Also it allows you to connected the two straps with minimum bulk, you don't need to fold them under. You see a close-up of the treated edge in photo #2.After singing all 4 ends I connected the two straps with my sewing machine. I made the strap long enough to be comfortable for both myself and my husband, which required doubling its original size. I can make the strap shorter by feeding the access strapping material into the buckle. I also attached an extra Velcro strip in case I wanted to tuck away the dangling strap while I am sitting in a chair and not bother with the buckle.With this simple fix the slacker chair is absolutely perfect! I can now take long walks like I did before my back problems.Ali Julia review

I use microwave for a lot of cooking with tomato-based and curry-based sauces. A few years back I picked up a hard plastic platter cover screen at Trader Joe's that I have been quite pleased with. However through the years it became some what discolored from curry splatter and when I saw this splatter screen I decided to try it.I am attaching several photos to accompany my review. Photo #1, which shows my hand under the splatter screen, illustrates what the screen looks like. It looks and feels similar to a piece of sheer window curtain. The edges are not finished in any way and have a ragged look as if someone cut it with scissors (i.e. it is not a smooth edge when you cut it with a circular cutting edge machine). A red bead is glued to the material every few inches along the edge. These beads meant to keep the edges down when the material is draped around a dish in the microwave, but they are too light to do this job well. If you have a large dish the material sags in the middle and touches the food.What I liked:1) It does prevent splatter2) It was relatively inexpensive3) I was able to wash it with dish washing solution like I would a rag, and the splatter was removed. Curry stains were not, but I don't hold that against the material.What I did not like:1) It sags in the middle and touches food2) Relatively small in diameter, not enough to cover some of my cooking containers (see Photo #2, where the splatter is over a small hummus container for relative size)3) After I washed it, I had hard time finding a place for it to dry. My hard plastic screen just stands in the dish drying rack, but it was hard to find a place for this large sheer piece of material that was not in the way.4) It looks rather unattractive, very home-madeBottom line: It is okay for small containers where the screen has a lot of overlap so it does not sag in the middle, but for my needs it is not good enough. I would not buy it again.

This filter comes up as an automatic recommendation for Black & Decker Pivot Vac (PHV1810 model), but this recommendation is wrong because this filter was for an older PHV1800 model and does not fit the new vacuum.This older filter is slightly smaller than the new model,and shaped more cone like. The right filter for PHV1810 model vac is PVF110.A friend of mine has PHV 1800 and I was hoping to buy the same model so we can share the filters my friend bought in bulk. However by the time I got around to buying the vacuum, 1800 was not available, and 1800 filters do not fit 1810 model. Not surprisingly, as B&D; wants to sell more filters for the new model.Be careful when you buy replacement filters, as there are still lots of filters for PHV 1800 on the market.If you have the right filter for the right model they work great. They are easy to empty, easy to remove and wash, easy to put back.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.Ali Julia review

I grow strawberries, wild straberries and herbs in the flower boxes on my desk. I have large (36"), medium (27") and smaller (24") flower boxes.I use this adjustable flower box holder to hold my longer flower boxes. It is designed to hold 18" to 36" flower boxes. The adjustable part spreads the supports for the flower boxes to make them less tipsy. I use these holders on my 2" wrought iron railings. The description says it will also work on to 2" by 4" and 2" by 6" wooden deck rails. My railings are black and so is this holder, they look good together.I like these holders because they work with a variety of flower box sizes, they are sturdy, and survived a winter without rusting.For the smaller boxes I use a non-adjustable garden box hodeders HoldAll Railing Flower Box Holder, Black which are slightly cheaper.Overall, I am very pleased with these hangers and will buy them again if I need another one.And finally, an idea I want to share which is not directly related to these railings holders but might of use to someone who is looking to buy railing holders for the same reason as me:I have back problems and my entire garden is elevated so I don't have to bend. If someone reading this review is looking for railing holders not only to decorate railing but to prevent bending down I want to share this additional idea for "garden on shelves". In addition to using railing holders I purchased a black 5 shelve utility shelve unit which I re-purposed as a three unit shelve system to elevate plants. Two units have top and bottom shelves, and one looks like table, it has just the top shelve and 4 legs. The units with two shelves can hold very heavy flower pots and boxes, the one with one shelve is used for lighter smaller flower boxes. This allowed me to expand my garden beyond the size limited by the amount of railing I have on my deck! Hope this helps someone to continue their gardening even with some physical limitation.Ali Julia review

The holder holds the mop well if the mop fits into the holder. Unfortunately only one of my four mops fit the holder. For example, the Swiffer Sweeper mop with its softer thicker handle was too large to go through the hole.I am including the details about the dimensions and installation so you can make figure out if your mops fit the holder. I am attaching three photos that I will be referencing in this review.This holder works when you insert the handle into the circle from the below. It is held in place by friction. See Photo #1. You can see me holding the holder with the broom inserted into the hole. I am not touching the broom, it is being held in the air by friction generated by contact with the holder. On the split image on that photo you can see a close up of the rubber ring with groves which provides a good grip on the broom handle.The inside diameter of the hole is 1 inch. If the handle of the broom is thicker you will not be able to put it through the hole. For example, Swiffer Sweeper handle has a thicker handle and I was not able to get it through the 1 inch hole.The holder has two options for hanging: adhesive strips on the back and screws. The warning on the package is that you cannot use adhesive strips on the wall paper. This is what I had a room where I wanted to hang the holder, so I had to use the screws. The screws that come with the holder are plain screw, anchors for hollow walls are not enclosed. I had some anchors on hand and was able to proceed with the installation.Installation:After inserting anchors into a hollow wall, I screwed in the back plate half way in, leaving some room between the wall and the back plate. This is necessary so you can slide in the top plate before tightening the screws (see Photo #2). Photo#3 shows the broom hanging on the holder.Bottom line: The one broom that fit the holder is firmly in place, it is easy to take out and put back in. However, the fit limitations were not clearly stated in the description and the Swiffer Sweeper I wanted to keep in this holder did not fit. Mounting limitations were not clearly stated in the description and I was not able use the adhesive mount. Not all mounting hardware was included (no anchors for hollow walls). Thus an 'okay' rating of 3 stars.

I purchased this Plantronics SupraPlus headset to work with Sysco desk telephone (VOIP). I use this phone in a relatively noisy office, so binaural design was important to me to block out unrelated noise. Wireless was important so I can move into enclosed office for privacy (conference rooms do not have phones, so one needs to initiate a call in a cubicle). The headset met all my expectations and I am pleased with it.SET UPSetting up adjustments for sensitivity requires two people. It took us a good 10 minutes to figure out which of the numerous settings would provide good sound on both ends. Originally even though I could hear well, I was either not heard on the other end or my voice had a lot feedback. I recommend making a test call once you do the initial set up to make sure that when you make an important call you can be heard well.Once the tuning was done, my voice sounds good on the other side as long as I position the mouth piece close to my mouth. If the mouth piece is not positioned close the sound on the other end has echo.OPERATIONThe phone is very comfortable and light. I can use it for multi-hour conference calls without any discomfort. I use the padded cushions (the headset also came with the foam cups).The best feature of the headset is the distance the sound carries. I am able to walk more than 50 feet away from my office and still be able to talk on the phone. During long conference calls I put the call on mute and even able to go to the bathroom while still listening to the conversation!Phone lifter is not included in the package (but can be purchased separately), so I need to start the phone call on the actual phone and then move if I need to make a phone call in another location.I have not run out of power on this phone yet. When the headset is not in use it is recharging on the stand.After approximately 6 months of use the headphones stopped functioning. I called Plantronics support line and they walked me through trying to reset the headset. When this did not fix it, they said they will ship the new headset and I needed to return the old headset within 30 days for the exchange to be free. This replacement was quick and painless. The second headset has been in operation for more than 6 months without any issues.Overall, I am very pleased with the headset and would buy it again.Ali Julia review

I bought a Toro Power Showel and I need a 100 feet power cord. I found that the hardest part was not shoveling with the power shovel, but dealing with the power cord. I have a number of back surgeries and problems, and I hoped this electric caddy would make it easier to deal with the cord.The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control and it requires a lot of bending.Update:I found a better solution - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review

I am very pleased with these envelopes. I was looking for the following combination of features (1) self sealing, (2) security marks on the inside, (3) sturdy with good thickness, (4) good price per envelope. This is exactly what I got in this product.I am attaching a collage of two photos. Photo #1 shows the envelope opened so you can see the security markings on the inside of the envelope.Photo #2 shows the grip-seal being lifted.Grip seal works well, I do not have to re-tape with scotch tape. The security markings prevent the writing being seen through the envelope if you look at the envelope in regular lighting situation. However, be aware that if you look through the envelope by bringing it to a light source you can still see the letters and numbers on a piece of paper inside of the envelope despite the security markings.Overall, I am pleased with the envelopes and would buy them again.Ali Julia review

We have central air conditioning but only one control unit downstairs, so the second floor is always warmer and less comfortable than the first floor. I tried putting fans at the bottom of the stairs to the second floor to improve air circulation but the air did circulate well as my old fans as they could drive the air up the stairs. Purchasing this pivoting fan made all the difference! This fan immediately help drop the temperature upstairs by about 2-3 degrees.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.I LIKE:------1. The best feature of this fan is the pivoting ability of the fan. The fan pivoted and held its position straight out of the box, I did not need to adjust or tighten anything. Photo #1 shows the fan pivoting, Photo #4 and photo#5 show two views of the fan at the bottom of my stairs.2. Photo #3 shows the fan on the digital scale. The fan is fairly light just under 7 pounds and 2 oz.3. I like handle on the top of the fan. It makes it very easy and comfortable to carry it around.4. The fan is fairly quiet even on the high setting. It producing no rattle noises of any sort, the sound you hear is white-noise type sound of blades pushing the air. It is so quiet that on a number of hot nights I took that fan into the bedroom. I am a light sleeper yet the noise from this fan did not bother me even as I was trying to fall asleep.I DON'T LIKE:-------------1. Minor: the switch to turn on the fan in the center back of the fan. So when you pivot it up you need to reach under the fan to turn it on or off. Close-up of the switch is shown on Photo #2.2. Minor: the length of the cord is 6.5 feet. I wish it was longer. I have to use the fan with an extension cord.Overall, I am very pleased with this fan and it quickly became my favorite fan of the 4-5 fans we have in the house: it pivots for great air flow control, it is powerful to quickly cool a room, and it is quiet to do its job without being noticed.Ali Julia review

I own two atomic clocks, so I know not all atomic clocks work as well as Crosse Technology.This clock is attractive, keeps time well, adjusts itself as necessary, and most importantly takes care of day light savings without any problems.My other clock fights me twice a year when the day light change happens - it often takes me several days to convince it to keep the right time. This is never the case with Crosse Technology - it just works!

As soon as I saw these brushes I knew they will solve my problem. They are perfect to wash out tall coffee mugs that have some crime stuck in the crevices. These coffee mugs are at work where there is no dish washer to run them through, but these little brushes do a great job!I also tried as they were designed - using to get off charred food stuck to cooking surfaces, and they do extremely well getting into small crevices.The set includes two brushes: a steel brush and plastic brush with stiff brisles. Steel brush is perfect for non delicate surfaces such as cast iron. I also used it on my coffee bug. The plastic brisles brush is good for delicate surfaces.I am very pleased with this set!

This used to be one of my favorite magazines, the photography is beautiful, but I recently stopped the many years of subscriptions because I felt it became rather repetitive. And given the price I decided it was not worth it for me. So maybe in a few years, I'll get another 1-year subscription. But a multi-year deal like I did before will not be in the future for me.

Written in 1902 this book is aimed at teachers in public schools using weaving as exercises for children.The books starts with history of the loom, starting with the invention of the loom in Egypt.Next the use of the loom in public schools is discussed, along with exercises recommended for students. The book goes over a number of projects, benefits to the children, tips for teachers. I found it surprisingly relevant, and I think it would be fun to use the projects in the modern setting.Ali Julia review

I recently downloaded the free PC reader for Kindle. This is my second book read in that format. I was not sure what to expect from this free tool, but I found that I am enjoying using it. It is easy to read and scroll through the book. I discovered a nice feature that if you double click on any word you will get a New Oxford American Dictionary with the word definition, pronunciation, and origin. PC reader allows you to high-light words, add notes, and copy. So this is a nice study tool! It gave me access to large number of free Kindle books and I am really enjoying it.If anyone knows how to tell a story it is Mark Twain. Combining humor and beautiful language this essay is a great read: education and give insight into this great man's mind.This Kindle book includes* How to tell a story* The wounded soldier* The golden arm* Mental telegraphy again* The invalid storyHow to tell a story starts with Mark Twain's famous disclaimer "I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told. I only claim to know how a story ought to be told, for I have been almost daily in the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years."He uses the four stories to illustrate his points about story telling.For example, his premise is that a humorous story does not have a purposes, it can go on and on as long as it is funny. The Wounded Soldier story demonstrates this point. He explains how to delivery a story with pauses and noises using The Golden Arm story to illustrate.This book is a quick and easy read. And I could not wipe the smile off my face either.

I purchased this antenna for use with Philips PET729/37 - 7 Inch LCD Portable TV / DVD PlayerPhilips PET729/37 - 7 Inch LCD Portable TV / DVD PlayerI wanted to use it in two rooms that don't have a cable outlet and during cable outages.However, downstairs I only 2 stations with the Terk Antenna. Upstairs I can get 3 channels with Terk Antenna ( NBC, ABC and PBS but I am missing CBS). If I connect the TV to a cable outlet it finds all the stations, but I don't need it in the rooms that I have an cable outlet.Disappointing!Other problems:* The antenna does not have a stable base, so it has to be on a very firm leveled area. Running cats or kids would easily knock it down without intending to.* The antenna is huge, it make the portable TV not portable.

Through the years I have tried many different brands and I found that Kotex feminine products provide the best quality. These Kotex Balance Ultra Thing Long Pads are no exception, it is a good quality product.I LIKE:1. They are unscented2. They are extra long for extra protection and very absorbent (10 2/8 inches long and 2 6/8 inches wide). I am also attaching a photo of unrolled pad under customer photos next a ruler for size and construction reference (photo #1)3. They have excellent adhesive that holds all day yet it does not leave any gooey gunk when the pad is removed.4. No wings makes them easier to attach, and because they stay on so well I have never felt that wings would give any additional benefit.5. They come individually packaged, which is handy if you need to take them along in your purse. When wrapped each package size is 3 6/8" by 3 3/4" (Photo #2)6. This packaging (6 pack of 40 counts) provides the best cost per padI DON'T LIKE:Nothing at all!These pads are very comfortable and absorbent. I can wear them all day and not even know they are there.Ali Julia review

I love Pollenex shower heads, they have a unique to them design - a setting which is a slot. It provides excellent massage, better than any other shower head I have tried. With a hand held shower I use the that setting not only to shower, but to clean the tub and fill container with water.I find them to be durable I get about 12 years out of them and only need a replacement because I have such hard water that head gets plugged up a bit.A tip for installation with no leaks: I use Teflon tape on every connection and hand tighten (not tools) not to crack the plastic.Update 4/23/2012I love this shower head and its unique slot shower head option. The original shower still works well, no leaks. However, the show in my guess bathroom needed a replacement and so I purchased a new Pollenex hand-held showerhead. This review was originally written for November 2012 purchase. I just received an order I have made in April 2012 and the design of the nozzles has changed. I posting a picture of which has the old design and the new design side by side. It still has the the slot, but it is just a little thinner. The other heads are redesigned more significantly.Ali Julia review

I found this book to be a very enjoyable read. The story was engaging and in a few places it had me shedding tears. I was sorry to read the last few pages of the book, as I wanted it to keep going. When you feel sad that you finished a book I know I really enjoyed the book!This is set between 1872 and 1900. I enjoyed learning more about live in Australia during that period. The history provides a great background for the events in the book. The action is entertaining, and has a couple of unexpected turns, as well as some heart wrenching moments. Colleen McCullough did not disappoint me, I loved reading it as much as I enjoyed reading "Thorn birds" and "Tim".

I had my Olfa rotary blade for over 10 years. I use it practically every week, so it gets a lot of work.I use my rotary cutter for quilting fabric, cutting photographic paper, cutting regular paper, so I use a lot of blades!A dull blade requires to do more than one cut to go through fabric or paper, and that not only takes extra time, but can result in a bad uneven cut. So having a refill pack on hand is very important.These blades are very high quality, they take many re-sharpening and continue to work as new!For most part of the 10 years I have re-sharpened my Olfe rotary blade, I used a rotary blade sharpernerRotary Blade Sharp-ener- For 45mm BladesTo sharpen the blade, you to disassemble the rotary cutter, which has a number of pieces including the blade. Then you place the the blade between two round circles the sharpener. Each side facing the blade has sand paper, that polishes out the nicks in the blade. You sharpen the blade by rotating the two pieces of the sharper against each other. After the sharpening you have to move the blade back to the rotary cutter, and then reassemble the rotary cutter correctly (one has to remember how pieces fit together exactly).Recently I discovered a sharpener that works without having to remove the blade from the cutter. It works by using the same motion as you cut, by moving the cutter in the sharpener itself. Not having to remove the blade from the sharpener is a *huge* advantage. It is faster, less chance of cutting yourself, and no chance of assembling the rotary cutter the wrong way (been there, done that). It is called "TrueCut"TrueCut Rotary Blade SharpenerBoth rotary cutters work well and prolong the life your blades, and thus save you money.So I highly recommend this blade refill and its usage with the blade sharpener.Ali Julia review

I was looking for a short hose to put between a faucet and the control center for my irrigation system (connectors, timers) so I can place the connectors on a stand which is easier for me to reach. Photo of my set up attached under customer photos.Turns out it is difficult to find a short water hose. Even though I don't need a water hose rated for drinking water this hose was the right length and I got it. Overall it works fine: the length is good and it handles my high water pressure fine. However, the connector to the faucet is plastic and even with a brand new washer and Teflon tape I have a small leak. Nothing major but you can see in the photo that the mulch under that connection is dark - it is always a bit wet. I don't have any other connections that leaks so I know how to make good connections with the aid of Teflon tape. The long hose with a metal connector that was used on this faucet before did not leak, so the problem is with this particular plastic connector.This hose is not totally perfect, but it has been at work for a few weeks and overall I am pleased with it.Ali Julia review

I grow strawberries, wild straberries and herbs in the flower boxes on my desk. I have large (36"), medium (27") and smaller (24") flower boxes.The small flower boxes are hanging on the wrought iron railings of my deck using these railing holders. They fit well and these holder hold flower boxes securely. The holders made it well though strong winds and surviving a winter without rusting.In addition to holding planters I put one of these hangers on the railing on my front steps near the door. When I come with a bag of groceries, my larger purse, or a backpack I have a place to rest my stuff while I am opening the door. When railing is empty is barely noticeable on my wrought iron railing.Overall, I am very pleased with these hangers and will buy them again if I need another one.Ali Julia review

A few years ago I helped my mother to clear her slow flowing sink using CLR Power Plumber. This method creates a vacuum and then clear the clog by sending down air. The air in the vacuum creates a powerful force which breaks up the clog. As I was using this gizmo I realize that it works just like a plunger, which also creates vacuum and pushes the air through.This weekend I got to test my theory because I got a slow draining kitchen sink. A tried liquid plumber a couple of weeks ago, but that only helped a little bit and by this weekend as soon as I washed the dishes the sink was filling up again.I covered the drain hole with a small plunger and I filled the kitchen sink with about 1 inch of water. Then I pumped the plunger. Nothing happened on the first plunge on the way down, but when the plunger went up I felt the pull of vaccum on the cup. On the second pump I heard the sound of swirling water draining! There was no mess coming up. I let the fresh water run and then I repeated the pumping another time for good measure. When I ran the water I saw it swirl, which was not occurring when my kitchen sink was draining slowly.I was so excited with an easy success that I decided to pump my bathroom sinks as well. The only difference there was that I stuffed a rag into the overflow hole. I had a bit of junk float up when I pumped, but it was just a few flakes - no spray or mess around the vanity. I even left the sink stopper in the sink. The plunger was placed over the stopper.It was extremely easy, absolutely no set up, absolutely no mess, and I can repeat it when necessary without any refills.Ali Julia review

I am a big fan pf Dynamic Design pots and boxes. They are sturdy and attractive looking especially from a distance when you cannot tell they are plastic. They have good depth to support healthy plants. I grow strawberries and herbs in these planters and they do well. I have had a number of Dynamic Design boxes in use for several years and they survived well without cracking and not much fading.I live in the cold North East and these planters stay outside during the winter. One of my friends is a master gardener and she gave me a tip to store pots on their side during the winter. This way they don't get filled with frozen water which can expand and crack the pots.

I had a number of nozzles in the past, but about a month ago picked up with metal Gilmour select-a-spray metal nozzle and I like it a lot better than my other nozzles.When it is attached to my hose it produces no leaks even when I leave the water faucet turned on. I have a very strong water pressure, and some older nozzles generate a leak even when I wrap every connection with Teflon tape. I like the springy feel of the handle as well as its ergonomic handle.I am attaching a photo under customers photos which shows the 5 spray options available on this nozzles. I use the wide-gentle-spray in the garden most of the time. The fine mist will be great in my herb garden. And strong spray worked well to get the winder grime off my car.This nozzle feels well constructed and has a nice pleasant to feel to it when you hold it. It has become my favorite nozzle.Ali Julia review

I purchased Chums retainers for the first time and I was not sure how they would fit various frames. I purchased Chums at the same time as the JMarti sunglasses for which I wanted to get a retainerSunglasses TR22 Sport Wrap for Cycling, Ski or Golf Superlite TR90 Unbreakable. So not seeing either of the products I decided to purchase three sizes of Chums figuring I will find use for them and this would cover my basis for the sunglasses.My review contains comparison of how different Chums retainers fit my different frames. I am also attaching 2 photos which show the type of frames that I mentioned in my review below.My sunglasses frames turned out to be slightly thicker than 2/8 on an inch. The large Chums fit the sunglasses just fine.The regular (original) size chums were too small to fit the sunglasses. The fit was too tight and I was afraid to break the frame if I pushed any harder. However, the regular size chums fit another pair of wire frames which were 1/8 of the inch thick. Surprisingly, they fit surely and the glasses hang on my neck without falling out. I figured because Chums had a retainer specifically designated for wire frames the regular ones may not work for wire frames, but that was no so.The small size chums fit the reading glasses with wire frames perfectly, the glasses feel very secure in the chums. The wire frames were 1/8 of the inch, without getting thicker at the end.Note on price: I noticed that the prices vary by color, since I did not care about the color I purchased the color which had the lowest price. It is a very attractive color and I pleased with my choice. The cotton is soft and pleasant to touch.As I mentioned earlier this is my first purchase of Chums retainers. I have been using a different cloth style retainer but with a flat plastic piece which is used for tightening rather than the ball. I have to say I am not that thrilled with the ball in the back of the retainer. When I sit I find the ball is always digging into my back until I pull it up and put it on my shoulders. This is why I am giving it a rating of 4 stars rather than 5 stars.

Scallops borders on quilts and throws look beautiful, but to look nice you need to fit the scallops to the amount of lenth you have. Each side has to end either at the end of the scallop on in the middle of the scallop to make the whole piece look nice. This requires quite a bit of math! This ruler makes it easy to create nice even scallops without a lot of work.I also like that it has multiple size options right next to each other. These options help you "audition" the right size scallop by just putting the ruler next to the edge your work. The ruller's slits work well with all my quiqlting pencils and quilting pens as the have a good depth and width. I also found the wavy side of the ruler useful.I used to make my own scalloped templates out of cardboard. This ruler is certainly much better than that. Not only it is faster than making your own template, but the edges don't fray from tracing over it.

I recently fell and gouged my leg. It was a nasty cut on my shin, which was 3.5 inches long and about wide. I had trouble finding a good bandage big enough to keep the wound protected. These Johnson&Johnson; pads were the only ones that worked well and had a reasonable cost. I used them both to clean my wound as well as to keep it covered to protect from being touched by the pant legs. The gauze pads are very absorbent yet provided some ventilation for the wound as well.Photo attached: an individual pad next to the box.They were easy to work with. I attached them to the leg with paper tape. This method was secure and not irritating to the skin.Cleaning the wound after injury is very important. I did not do it quite right and that resulted in an infection, which took several weeks to cure. Here is the wound cleaning procedure that my doctor gave me along with the anti-biotic to cure the infection:1. Wash your hands thoroughly using plenty of soap and warm water. Rinse and dry with clean towel.2. Assemble all of your supplies such as cleaning solutions so that you don't have to move or interrupt the procedure.3. Remove old dressing by loosening all of the tape. Pull all tape ends gently toward the wound so that you won't disturb the healing process by pulling the healing edges apart.4. When all tape is loosened remove all dressings, one layer at a time, and discard into plastic disposal bag.5. Pick up a mirasorb gauze sponge by one end and dip it into the cleansing solution recommended by your doctor.6. Clean wound by stroking gently in a circular motion. Do not scrub back and forth, especially across incision line.7. Repeat this process using clean sponge until entire wound is cleaned.8. Pat dry wound using a clean sponge.9. Discard used sponge in a plastic bag.

Maxi-lock thread is a good quality thread and is cost effective. I don't have the serger sewing machine, yet I find it very useful for my quilting, embroidery, and sewing needs.I use it in two way:(1) I use it as a top thread using thread cone holder.(2) I use it as a bottom bobbin thread. To wind it I use thread cone holder.For general sewing I use Maxi Lock in top and bottom of my sewing machine. For embroidery and quilting I use Sulky thread as the top thread, and Maxi Lock thread as the bottom thread.I am able to find tension on my sewing machine, which allows me to use Sulky thread as the top thread and maxi-lock thread as the bottom thread. I do this by setting the top tension to zero, and making small adjustments to the bobbin tension. This works particularly well when the bottom thread is close in color to the top thread. Maxi Lock has a huge variety of colors available. I have a large selection of bobbins with different Maxi Lock colors sitting ready to go to match whatever my top thread happens to be.Using these large cones saves me a lot of money. They are so much more economical than the small spools, especially the wonderful (but expensive) Sulky threads.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. With a good sale I can find this thread at around $2 a spool. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.

I heard you are supposed to replace toilet tank fill valves every 5 years... but I had mine for 12 years with no problems.I was motivated to write a review because I thought I would need to replace it... but I managed to fix it... and I think it is going to last a lot longer.I wanted to share the fix, so if this happens to others they can also get a bit of extra life out of their valves as well.As I mentioned earlier the valve worked well for many years and I never paid attention to it. However a few days ago my toilet tank began to run continuously. My normal fix for this is to replace the flapper which I did, but I what I did not realize is that I bumped the toilet fill valve while doing it and it rose slightly, which made the toilet fill higher than overflow pipe. So the problem got worse rather than better.Since I never had to mess with the valve it was not clear to me how to lower the water level and my handy house repair manual did not address this type of a valve.Turns out to adjust the water level you need to simply turn the upper half of valve counter-clockwise to unlock and move up and down as needed, then turn back to lock. In my case I needed to lower the valve to lower the water level, and then turn clockwise till valve snaps into locked position. It moves smoothly and easily which surprised me after 12 years of sitting in my very hard well water.It is back working like a champ! I am very impressed.Ali Julia reviewP.S. If you have a Hunter toilet tank fill valve (my second even slightly older valve is Hunter) -- Hunter Plumbing Products were purchased by Korky in 2000, and the Hunter valves were re-branded as the Korky QuietFill. So the instructions are the same for both of these valves.

I like keeping my crafts organized so when I saw this organizer on a Gold Deal special I could not resist. Overall I am satisfied with it, even though it has several things that could have been better.I am attaching a photo collage of 4 photos which I will be referencing in this review.The organizer arrived with no protective packaging, no instructions, and no mounting hardware.I did not see any dividers in the package. Only when I was taking photos for this review did I notice that the back of the organizer has plastic dividers molded in the back, so if you want dividers you can cut them off. Since the organizer draws fall out when you tilt the organizer forward you need to remove the dividers before you fill the compartments with stuff. See photo #3 to see the photo of the back of the organizer. Note that the number of the dividers are much smaller than the number of compartments.As I mentioned earlier the organizer came without any mounting hardware. The spacing between mounting holes is 18 inches, so you cannot place both holes into studs spaced 16 inches apart. Photo #4 shows the hardware I purchased separately to mount the organizer on hollow walls. #8-10x1" bolts with anchors worked well.There is a total of 12 larger compartments and 32 smaller compartments. Photo #1 shows organizers of each of size opened with a pen inside each for relative size. Photo #2 shows the front of the organizer.The large compartments are 4.5" wide, 5.5" long and 2" deep. The small compartments are 2" wide, 5.5" long, and 1.5" deep.The compartments can be taken out fairly easily which I find that handy when I need to use the content. I wish the compartments were a little longer (6" would have been perfect). I already filled up all the larger compartments and but not all the small compartments. It would be nice if there were different versions of this organizer where people could select the exact configuration they wanted (more large compartments, more small compartments, and so forth) as I suspect people's needs vary.I LIKED:1. Organizer is helpful to keep small items orderly2. Wall mounting saves space, I placed behind the door in a wasted space otherwise3. Each bin can be easily taken out and put backI DID NOT LIKE:1. No mounting hardware, no template for making holes in the wall2. No instructions - I noticed dividers just by chance because I was writing this review and taking photos3. Would have preferred slightly longer compartments (6 inches rather than 5.5 inches)Overall, I am pleased and would buy this organizer again if I had to do it over again.Ali Julia review

These wafers need to come with a big warning "Addictive"! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them. If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag. Wafers come in a resealable bag, and in theory can last a long time... but in my house the longest one bag lasted was 2 days!I bought the lemon flavor of Loacker's Quadratini wafers. They have a nice strong lemon flavor - nicely tart with a sweet creamy finish, crunchy and pleasant on your tongue. You can chew a wafer to get the pleasant crunch on just hold it in your mouth and let it melt slowly. Either way you will get an extra ordinary taste experience!I am attaching a photo and two cookies shown from different angles. Each cookie is 1 inch square. Each consists of 74% lemon cream and 26% wafer.Wafers have no artificial flavors or colorants, and no preservatives.Ingredients:Unbleached wheat flour, pressed coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder (milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, lemon juice powder 2%, salt, leavening agents (sodium hydrogen cargonate, disodium diphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithin, natural vanilla pods, lemon-peel-oil, spices.Loacker wafers are made in Austria and Loackers company had been known for their wafers since 1925.Ohhhh, so good!

Very excellent coffee candy. And you get a nice set of 12 bags which contain 42 candies each. Each bag is 5.3 ounces. I am attaching two photos of a box with all the candy bags - I was pleasantly surprised by the amount and the weight of the package.I decided to try Bali's Best Coffee Candy after trying Kopiko coffee Candy. I really liked the candy but thought the price was too much ($5.49 for 32 candies, 4.23 oz). So I decided to try this Bali's Best Coffee Candy. Bali's has stronger coffee taste and slightly sweeter. Both are excellent candy, but Bali's is a much better deal.I noticed that the price on the Coffee candy fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.

This chocolate is heavenly! It is dark and creamy and melts in your mouth. It leaves a pleasant taste you mouth when it is gone. My only problem is stopping at just one square.It has an exquisite taste!Amazon is always my first shopping stop - usually the price and convenience of buying on line cannot be beat. However, in the last year the price on these bars went way up. I use a nice tool that allows me to see a history of product price for the past year, you can find it by searching for price history alert and selecting the one that has the word camel in its name. I find it very useful.On the positive price in terms of price, I discovered that Lindt Stores sometimes have a shelve with 'seconds' which means the mixture of ingredients is a bit off but you cannot detect the difference in the taste unless you are a professional taster. I could not. These seconds go for 10 bars for $15. Can't beat that for a totally amazing chocolate.

I tried and tried, but could not get the pucks to the roof not to mention some specific spot on the roof by throwing. I did not dare to get on a ladder since the snow banks are taller than me covered with chunk of ice from ice dam removal done by a crew that came a few days ago.Here is what wound up working for me. I took a nylon stocking, filled it with calcium chloride to form a sausage about 4" long. To make it easier to fill the stocking I took a 16 oz yogurt container and cut out its bottom. This made a nice sturdy funnel which kept the top of the stocking wide open for pouring the calcium chloride.Note that bigger is not better! On my first try I tried making 8-9" sausage, but it made the sock too heavy to stay on the steep roof, and it slid off.I tied the top of the stocking onto itself and then tied it to a garden thread so I could retrieve the stocking later (who wants a roof full of stocking?). The thread turned out to be helpful on my failed attempts, when the sock wound up in the bushes and I had to pull it out and try again.Then I took an extension pole used for a roof rake. I replaced the big rake with a small brush so it would be easier to hoist it up to the level of the roof of my dormer where my major ice dam is located.My first few attempts were to fold the sock over the brush and dump it on the roof. But that did not work as either the stocking fell before it reached the desired spot, or I could not disengage the brush without knocking the sock down.Finally, the solution that worked was using the pole and the brush as a lever. I put the thread attached to the sock over the brush, and raised the brush to the roof positioning it where I wanted the sock to be located. The stocking meanwhile was laying on the ground. Then, using the brush as my lever, I pulled on the thread to raise the stocking to the roof. This worked very well the first time I tried! [see attached customer image]My second problem area, is the steep lower roof. I could not get the stocking to stay on the lower roof as it has a very steep angle, so I suspended a stocking with ice melt on a thread from a window. I hope it will melt a channel in the ice dam. [see attached customer image]Update the next day:I am attaching a third photo which shows the channel built by the salt stock. This happened overnight. Pretty neat! I can see the trapped water coming out of the channel.I also wanted to make a note that the nylon gets stuck to the ice. When I tried repositioning one of the socks it would not budge. The gravity makes it drops when the salt melts the ice around it, but reposition the sock to another spot turned out to impossible because it is stuck to the ice, and pulling it might tear the stocking dropping all the salt at once rather than via slow release.

I am a quilter, so my ironing board in the study is always out with the iron is on it. I also use my ironing board for doing layout as it allows me to do so without bending down (important because of back problems). Since I am around my ironing board a lot I have knocked down the iron to the floor quite a few times. Not good for the iron (had to replace at least one iron) and not good for the floor (have a gouge in the wood floor).I have tried this Iron rest, which improved things but did not provide a totally satisfactory solution.I liked:1) Having more ironing surface, since it clips to the ironing board2) Reasonably pricedWhat I did not like1) It stucks out from the ironing board. In my sewing room set up this did not work well, it was either in the way when approching the board, or hanging over the sewing table, also in the way.2) Because it was in the way, I managed to almost knock it down, so it did not solve my original problem3) When iron was full of water, it dripped on my wood floorEventually I found a solution that does work perfectly for me - a silicone iron rest.Whitney Designs 3131 Silicone Iron Rest PadThe Silicone Iron Rest pad is heat resistant and non-slip. It is very stable. As an added bonus the pad is water proof, so if the water leaks out it stays on the pad.

I use buckwheat groats as a side dish. To bring out its sweet eathy flavor I toast the groats in a skillet with a light spray of oil. Then cook them with water as I would rice (2 cups water to 1 cup groats). I like it mixed it with cheese (especially goat cheese), basil, and lemon zest.One cup of cooked groats contains just 155 calories and five grams of satiating fiber. I find that when I increase my fiber intake it is easier for me to loose weight. Buckwheat is rich in prebiotics, which provide sustenance for good bacteria in the body that improve digestion.Buckwheat groats are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the content into the container.In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.FLAXSEEDSNutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.HEMP SEEDSSimilar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.BUCKWHEAT GROATSSoft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.WHEAT GERMThe flaky center of wheat kernels.

I was looking for a gardening shoe that is easy to put on and take off, and that are waterproof. I was looking at various clogs when I stumbled onto Sloggers. They turned out to be a perfect solution.I wear size-7.5 in a regular shoe and got size-8 Sloggers. My feet are not super wide, but not narrow either. The Sloggers are a perfect fit. I have been wearing Sloggers for a couple of months now. They are very comfortable, and I have been wearing them not only in the garden or washing the car, but when I have to do quick errands in the rain. Once in a pouring rain I wore them to work, so I was in Sloggers for about 12 hours! I had no problems at all. I was as comfortable in the evening as I was in the morning. My feet were NOT hot and sweaty despite not taking them off for such a long time.Sloggers are a bit heavier than I expected. They are made of rubberized material top and bottom. No openings anywhere, so they are very good for walking in wet grass. Surprisingly, my feet do not get too hot despite having no ventilation in the shoe. The sole of the shoe is nicely textured. I am attaching a photo which shows the top and the bottom of the shoe. Next to the shoe I positioned a ruler so you can see how high the back of the shoe rises. The back is not totally open, it has a slight rise which help to keep your foot firmly in the shoe. The bottom of the show has some padding, so it provides nice support for the foot and is responsible for very comfortable feel-ing. And of course they are very easy to put on and take off, which is very handy when your hands are covered with dirt from the garden.The second photo I am attaching to this review shows my foot wearing the shoe, hopefully this gives a better idea of the look and fit than just the shoe by itself. In a close-up you can see a bit of room in the back - the difference between size-7.5 foot and size-8 shoe.The men a work made fun of the shoes, they thought they were ugly (what do they know?), but I think they are cute plus very comfortable and functional.

I am an experienced fiber artist and has done a lot of thread painting works before reading this book. Yet I found some new ideas and tips in this book.The book's format is a bit unusual 4" wide by 11" high. I liked the narrow format as I could keep it on the desk without taking up much room. It is kept together on a spiral, which means it stays open well on well on any page you want to leave it open on - great for a reference book. It has a lot of pictures, and at the end a couple of patents.Chapter 1. Inspirations, where the author talks about finding inspiration from daily life and using photograph to start your artwork withChapter 2. Equipping the Studio. This chapter talks about materials used in the artwork, such fabrics, tulles, threads, notions. It gave me a couple of new ideas I have not tried.Chapter 3. The master pattern. In this chapter the author shares how to evaluate photographs and how to sequence the work.Chapter 4. Thread painting stitches. This chapter describes underlay stitch and other stitches like to use in her artwork. I found this chapter very interesting because I use a totally different technique, so it was really nice to learn a different approach.Chapter 5. Thread painting methods. In this chapter the author discussed tulle sandwich and direct method. The author discusses which method works best under different conditions.Chapter 6. Completing the quilt. This chapter is about borders, squaring, quilting. This chapter points out the difference between working with a regular quilt and thread painting quilt (which has more dimension and uneven areas).Chapter 7. Projects. In addition to covering different types of applique, this chapter has 5 different projects which are described in detail.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book, a nice reference, and a good inspiration for my own projects.

I am very pleased with this toilet paper holder. I was not sure how it would fit my toilet because it does not have a square tank, but it fit perfectly. The lid fits firmly over it, it does not rattle, the holder is out of my way yet easily reachable. I am attaching several photos to illustrate the fit.The first photo shows overall image of how it looks with the lid on the tank and one extra roll on the holder.The second photo shows how the holder fits over the toilet tank with the lid off.The third photo is a close-up of the holder attached to the toilet tank with lid on.The holder fits well into the modern chrome look of my bathroom and it adds convenience of having a spare toilet roll always on hand. I am planning to order the second holder for my other bathroom.

I love Near East Couscous. I always have a few boxes of couscous on hand for "emergencies" when I had no time to cook and I am in a hurry. Not only do I like the taste it is the easiest and fastest thing to prepare that I know.Couscous is a coarsely ground pasta made from semolina, a type of wheat. When cooked it is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Instant couscous already has been steamed and then dried again before it is packaged. To prepare it it only needs be soaked in boiling water until it swells, a process that takes only a few minutes. You don't even need the stove.To start, measure out your couscous.Pour it into a heatproof bowl.Add hot water - the general proportion is 2 parts couscous to 3 parts water. So for 1 cup of couscous you'll need 1 1/2 cups water.Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 5 minutes.Fluff with a fork before serving.Couscous doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own, but it works well as a base for vegetable or meat dishes. I have not found anything does NOT go with it. I like it with chicken, fish, lamb, and beef. I especially like it with the dishes have sauce as couscous absorbs the sauce so well. It also mixes well into salads and can be flavored with herbs like coriander, basil. It's a great base for all sorts of dishes.I recommend it. It is a must have in my pantry!Ali Julia review

I purchased Miracle-Gro Garden Soil to plant a hydrangea in my back yard. I wanted to give it a bit of good soil around the root ball instead of the clay I have. I have purchased potting soil on many occasions for my container garden but this time we got a bag of Garden Soil. Turns out there is a big difference! I did not give it much thought before. Potting soil has peat moss in it, it is airy, and it has a nice earthy smell. Garden soil is dense, heavy, and smells like cow manure. I had to dampen the dirt around the roots of the plant with my knuckles and my nose was low to the ground and, boy, did it smell. I was quite pleased for my plant but could not help yelling out, boy, is it stinky!As far as price, I got my dirt at the local home improvement store for $7.50. Shipping dirt is expensive.

I bought this clock for my mother, who has trouble reading her current digital clock read-out due to reflections from the window. This is a good looking clock, easy to read, and she really likes it. Note that the packaging is a little tricky to remove for someone with arthritis, the plastic cover top is attached to the bottom with tiny staples. I bet my mother would have trouble opening it by herself.The clock is fairly light, I am including a photo of the clock with battery on a postal scale, and it weights 5.1 oz. The clock runs on one AA battery. Note that the battery is not included with the product. Despite the light weight it did not feel flimsy to me.I read in reviews for this clock that the battery sometimes does not staying in the clock so I decided to put in the battery myself to make it easier for my elderly mother. At first I had trouble putting in the battery all the way into a deep battery chamber. It was positioned at an angle. The clock began running even when I did not insert the battery correctly, but I can see how it could have easily come out if I were to leave in that angled position.But then I noticed directions on the cover than the battery should be put in with the positive polarity first, and as soon as I inserted it that way the battery went in easily and was seated firmly in the deep chamber. I am attaching a photo which shows the direction on the cover next to the properly inserted battery. When I inserted the battery deeply in the chamber it was very secure. The clock has a ribbon that goes under the battery for easy removal.Overall, both my mother and I are very pleased. Good looking, well behaved clock and at a very reasonable price. I recommend it.Ali Julia review

My main application for the clamps is quick set up for threading my weaving loom. I use two quick-grip hand-clamps and two C clamps.C-clamps have a very strong hold. Once they are ratcheted I cannot move the item the hold at all.The handi-clamps have a decent hold however they the hold is not as strong as the C-clamps that you need to ratchet. It is important for me that the clamps don't move in case I accidentally bump into them and they do not. However if I want to I can move them slightly without releasing the clamp. The quick-grip hand-clamp clamps are very easy and fast to set up (and remove), all you need to do is compress the handle.I am attaching a photo of my weaving set up: handi-clamps clamps hold the metal bracket to the table, while the smaller C clamps attach the rigid heddle to a think wooden stick, which is in turn clamped to the metal bracket. This set up allows me to reach the heddle from both side for threading. This home-made set up cost well below $20, if I were to buy a commercially made system it would be measured in hundreds.The clamps are easy to set up and remove, easy to pack up for storage when not in use, and I am extremely pleased with the clamps. I have been using them for approximately 9 months at least once a week, the springs still work as well as they day I bought them.Ali Julia

I ordered this bag holder for my bathroom to hold grocery bags which I use as liners for my bathroom trash can. I am so pleased with it that I am about to order the second holder to hold the extra produce bags (those clear bags for veggies and fruits that I re-use for various purposes in the kitchen).The bag holder is compact, unobtrusive, and not bad looking. I am attaching two photos.The first photo show the holder with a ruler taped it to size reference.The holder is 6.6" wide x 15.75" height x 3/6" depth (measured from the wall, so this is how much it extends from the wall, not its depth which is a bit smaller). The front opening is 1.75" wide and 8.75" long.The second photo is a series of three photos which show inserting the bag in and removing the bag. The way I insert the bag is that I twist it then stuff it in the top hole, and then drag it down through the front opening. The bag will not go down on its own. Removing the bag is easy by just pulling on it from the front opening.As I mentioned earlier I plan to use my second bag holder to store and dispense produce bags, which currently create clutter in my kitchen. I am very pleased with this clutter-reducing holder.Updated 7/7/2011I now own three of these bag holders. One in the bathroom so I can store and use grocery bags as liners for the trash bin in the bathroom. One in the pantry near the kitchen for general re-use of grocery bags. One in the kitchen to hold and dispense produce bags.I mounted the kitchen holder on the side of the cabinet using the sticky mounting tape on the back, the other two are mounted using the screws that came with the holder.As you can tell from multiple purchases I really like this holder!

After a recent surgery I needed an accurate easy to use thermometer to keep an eye on my temperature to guard against infection. I already had an ADC ADREMP digital stick thermometer which took temperature in the mouth or underarm. I decided to buy an infrared thermometer thinking that it might be better, but it really did not turn out to be the case. I was able to compare both with the medical thermometer when visiting nurse came to check on me. I found that both thermometers were accurate within 0.5 F.DIGITAL STICKADC ADTENO gives a reading in 8 seconds and beeps if you have a fever. The tip is flexible so it is comfortable to use. It has both Centigrade and Fahrenheit modes. Note: The normal temperature in Centigrade is 36.6C.EXERGEN TEMPORALThis thermometer takes a temperature in 1 second, all you need to do is swipe it across your forehead. It beeps when it is done.I learned not to worry if my body temp isn't 98.6 F (or 36.6 C). Your normal might be higher or lower, plus your temp can fluctuate up to 2 F in a day. Take a reading when you're not sick to see what your normal is.The digital stick is easy to use:1. Place a probe cover over the tip. Select oral, underarm or rectal site as needed.2. Push the button located on the end of the thermometer. The thermometer will beep and the display will read: "188.8 " (test pattern) followed by previously taken temperature that will be displayed for approximately 2-seconds.3. The F or C symbol will flash when the unit is ready to measure temperature.If there is a trianle symbol flashing in the display it means the thermometer's battery is low and needs to be replaced to get an accurate reading.4. The unit will complete measurement in 8 seconds. The F or C symbol will stop flash-ing and the unit will beep signaling completion.5. To turn off the unit push the same button you used to turn it on. If you forget to turn it off manually it will automatically shut off in 10 minutes.For those seeking manufacturer's instructions you can find a PDF version of the instructions is www (dot) adctoday (dot) com /images/PDF/IB/93-418-00 (dot) pdf.Both types of thermometers did a fine job. Infrared is faster, the digital stick is a lot cheaper. If you don't have specialized needs (like finicky child) digital stick thermometer works very well.Ali Julia review

I use these weights at the physical therapy office. I have to say that I don't like the vinyl covering on the weights, as they become slippery when my hands sweat.I prefer the neoprene coverings weights like theseHeavyhands 1-2-3 Multi-Pac - Blackwhich I have at home. I suppose in a physical therapy office it is easier to clean vinal weights, but I prefer not to use the vinyl covered weights at home.

I love garlic and seem to be attracted to buying various tools to chop and peel it. This OXO Mini Chopper has become my favorite garlic chopper. It does a very nice job. I bought both a large and small version of this Chopper and seem to use this small one more.It works great not only on garlic, but nuts.I find it a bit hard to wash, you really do have to take it apart to clean.Ali Julia review

I like this chopper, it makes a quick job of cutting onions minimizing the eye irritation. It is ergonomically shaped and easy to use. Most often I use it on the cutting board, removing the bottom dish. I never used the little spoon it comes with. I find it a bit of a pain, as it tends to fall off the place where it is attached, so I removed it and keep in the kitchen draw.I liked the chopper so much that I gave it as a present to my mother, who has arthitis in my hands. Sometimes she can't even grip a knife when he hands hurt, but she can operate this chopper!

I use (and re-use) them to mark the references I work with. When I find a place I need to come back to, these tabs work great as they do not fall out. They remain sticky for a long time, so I have used the same set for different references.Before this product I used pieces of paper, and sometimes they would fall out and I would lose time finding that spot again. A piece of paper, however, had one advantage, I could write one or two words to help me find the right tab quickly. I tried writing on these tabs, but it does not work as well as paper. Here is a product enhancement idea: make them more pen friendly!

These 3" by 3" Post-it notes are my favorite size notes. They are big enough to wrote a short note on, but small enough to fit anywhere. I use them as bookmarks, for note writing, for reminders, and so much more.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert".

The best part of this ruler is the excellent markings on the ruler! Clearly designed by someone that knows something about quilting and that it is important to have marking all over the ruler :-) I also like the color that stands out on most of the fabrics.I noticed that the price of this ruler fluctuates.

I read this book much later than most. I love mystery books, so looking back I am not totally sure why I resisted reading it! But I am so glad that I put my reservations away and started reading. Once I started I was almost instantly hooked, it was totally enjoyable story with unexpected twists and turns. It is the kind of book that makes you stay awake half the night - just a few more pages... just a few more pages...Once I finished the book, I decided I really enjoyed Dan Brown's way of story telling, and since then read every single book he has written, and can't wait until the next one comes out.

You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this book. This books about life, growing old, and thinking about what is important in our lives. A thoughtful and nostalgic John Grisham continues to be a great story teller.We see the story through the eyes of Neely Crenshaw, an All-American quarterback, who was brought back to his old town by the death of his coach Eddie Rake. Through his eyes we relive the highs and lows of Eddie Rake's live. We learn that even great people can make mistakes, we learn how to forgive, and how to ask for forgiveness.It is the kind of story that touches you and makes you feel good after you finished it.

I purchased DAP Silicone clear cartridge to seal the seam between new deck and the house. I applied in mid November at a temperature about 50 degrees. The next morning it was perfectly set, despite some rain during the end of the day when I applied it.When I cut the spout I had trouble getting the silicone to come out until I broke the seal formed inside of the tube with a small screw driver. The application was easy, the silicone gave me some time to work with it until it set. I found that the gloves were getting in my way, and I used my bare fingers to spread the silicone. I wet my finger before touching the silicone. I was able to clean up fairly easily with applying rubbing alcohol to my hands after the soap/water round.Note that I purchased another clear silicone sealant cartridge a year ago. I had absolutely no hope that the old cartridge would still be usable and purchased this new one. As I was throwing out the old cartidge I gave it a try just to see if it was totally hard... and to my amazement a big wet glob came out! It was still pliable and usable. Oh well, next time I will not assume it hardened I will try it first.Ali Julia review

I purchased this folding table for my small deck, where I wanted to have a table but space is at a premium because I have a patio garden. This table works quite well as it is easy to fold up and store in the corner of the deck when I don't need it. The only negative is that if you want to move the table when it is in the open position it should not have anything on it. The table folds in the middle during any movement (see attached photo). This is a bit inconvenient when I use it on the deck to put down a cup of coffee or a lunch plate. It would have been better if the table had a latch on the side to stabilize the top when it is in the open position.I am attaching a collage of 3 photos under customers photos to aid in this review.Photo #1 shows the table next to a ruler, the table top is at 20" from the ground.Photo #2 demonstrates the folding flaw I mentioned earlier. I just grabbed a side of the table to move it, and you see how it folds in the middle causing anything on top of it to slide or fall.Photo #3 shows how the table opens from the folded position: first lift the two side of the top and then slide them together. As they slide the legs automatically extend.This table works well when space is limited, and I have enjoyed using on my deck. If it had a latch to stabilize the open top position it would have been perfect. As it stands now it gets a 4 star rating: good but not perfect.Ali Julia review

I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip. This keeps it pliable and clean. It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package. If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs. Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.

Swimming:I took up swimming in the pool as exercise for my back and someone suggested these silicone ear plugs to prevent water going into your ears in the swimming pool.These ear plugs do not prevent water going into your ear.The ear plugs that work well for swimming are these Aqua Sphere conical swimmers ear plugsNoise:My significant other snores, so I've become an expert on ear plugs.I have tried quite a few of them and Mack's earokugs is among them. Below is a summary of my experiences with different ear plugs. I hope you will find it useful. Other the noise protection, the important factors for me if the plugs stay in your ear, and if they are breathable (some of them made my ear canals hot and sweaty, that makes them itch, and itching wakes me up).* Mack's pillow soft earplugs (sillicone), 22 decibels. These earplugs did not work for me at all. They did not provide enough sound protection, my ear canal got hot and sweaty and itchy (and needing to itch wakes me up), and they also tend to fall out.* Hearos ear plugs,ultimate softness, 32 decibels. Hearos have a good size, not too long not too short. They are slightly shorter than Flent Quiet time, so they don't stick out of my ear, and this means they don't catch the pillow and don't get pulled out. They are also slightly softer, and provide a little less protection. Overall they are comfortable, but I find that my ears get hot and sweather using them.* Hearos ear plugs, Xtreme protection Series, 33 decibels. Hearos are slightly shorter than Flent Quiet time, so they don't stick out of my ear, and thus stay in better. They are firmer than Hearos ultimate softness so they provide more noise protection. Overall they are comfortable, but I find that my ears get hot and sweather using them.* Flents Quiet Contour, molded foam, 33 decibels.This is my favorite ear plug. It gives me the best noise protection, it stays in the ear very well, it is comfortable, my ear canal does not get hot and itchy. I find the most comfortable.* Flent Quiet Time, comfort foam, 33 decibels. I like these earplugs less thant Quiet Contour because it does not seem to stay in my ear as well. The ends of the foam seem to stick out and catch on the pillow when I turn, catching the end on the pillow pulls them out of my year. I got it to stay in the ear better by trimming about 3/8th of an inch. Because they tend to fall out, I don't get as good of a sleep in them. However, when they are in the sound protection is good. (see attached photo of the full size ear plug, and the one that is trimmed to be shorter)For me Flents Contour ear plugs win on all counts - noise protection, comfort, staying, breathability.

Earlier this fall, after a very expensive service call from a plumber, I found out that some creature chewed through the rubber tubes of my forced air heating system (plumber left me a chewed tube as evidence). I recall seeing some dropping in the basement, they did not look like mouse dropping (tubes rather than balls), so I got both a mouse trap and rat/chipmunk trapBig Snap-E Rat Trapas I don't want to have another service call.I am attaching a photo of both next to each other for size reference (I was wondering about this before buying both). This weekend I set them both up, and they were fairly easy to set up. The instructions did not mention what to use as bait, so it took me some research to find what works best. It appears that many people find that peanut butter works best because it is sticky and cannot be easily carried away like a piece of cheese.I placed the traps on cardboard I cut away from a large cereal box. This will make it easier to handle the disposal of the intruder.I was a bit worried that I will have trouble setting it up as due to a recent back surgery I can't put a lot strength into pushing on levels, but it was not hard. I had to push on the level until it caught a hook. The trap was fairly easy to set off, while I was moving it around to place in the right place it got set off. Luckiness I was not moving it with my hand. Note that it got flipped and moved about 2 feet away from where it was before it triggered.Ali Julia review

My first taste of this dried seaweed was at CostCo at one of their tasting stations. The smacks are very thin dried and crispy wafers of seaweed. They have slightly salty seaweed flavor. They crunch and then dissolve in your mouth. I liked them! And with each new piece I liked them more. Each pack has 10 slices, and it is about the right amount for a nice little snack.This Seaweed snack has no sugar or additives, while fairly low on calories, and not too bad on salt. At the same time it is rich in iodine, iron, and protein. So this is pretty healthy snack overall.Nutrition Facts for each servingServing Size: 1 pack (6g)Calories 25 CaloriesTotal Fat 1g - 2%Saturated Fat 0g - 0%Sodium 60mg - 2%Total Carbohydrate 2g - 1%Dietary Fiber 0g - 0%Protein 2g - 4%Vitamin A - 35%Vitamin C 20%Calcium - 2%Iron - 2%I found them very addicting!Ali Julia review

I decided that making such much hummus from scratch would be too much work so I decided to make it from the mix and the results were very good. The entire batch was gone at the end of the party!Note: I added slightly more water than recommended to get the consistency I like.

High quality plastic transparent sleeves for 2.5" by 3.5" sized content. The plastic is somewhat stiff so it offers good protection.The sleeve is sized inside 2 3/4 x 3 7/16 x 1/32, so any 2.5" x 3.5" fits nicely with a little room to spare.I am an artist that sells my own art work, some of my pieces are artist trade cards which are the size of the baseball card. I sell them packaged in these sleeves and they look very professional. The sleeves protect the art from elements and finger prints. So these nice sleeves are not just for baseball cards!

I do a lot of my gardening on my knees as I find it easier on my bad back. Until I purchased Fiskars Kneelers Knee Pads I used a pad that I knelt on. The problem with the pad, of course, is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot. It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs. I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads. The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground. It is made out of thick (slight under 1/2 inch) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad, which is made with soft black non-slippery material. The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide, and 7 inches long. It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg. Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg. If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter. If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro. I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose. They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads. Even if when I don't plan on using a warranty replacement, it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty. For warranty service, email warranty@fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands, Inc. 2537 Daniels Street, Madison, WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads, in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before. I recommend this product.Ali Julia review

Following a surgery I had a lot of hair loss due to stress to the system and harsh medicines in the hospital and after care. My hair dresser noticed the problem with my hair and recommended this product. I've always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try.I just finished my first bottle of daily use. I don't see any difference in the amount of hair I see in the drain after I wash my hair, nor do I notice any additional fullness in. In addition to lack of perceptible results I don't like the smell (medicine-like somewhat minty smell, reminded me of mouthwash). And it is expensive!I just finished the first bottle and it will be my last.Ali Julia review

I had the following requirements for a tripod which Manfrotto 718B Digi meets beautifully1. Quick release legs2. Quick release plate3. Lightweight. Really lightweight. Under 4 pounds.4. Able to support a digital SLR with 300 zoom lensPrice was not a major part of my selection process, but the fact that this tripod was $100 was a very nice plus.I have used this tripod for several years now and I am very very pleased with it. It totally lived up to my expectations. I set up in a matter of seconds, all levers operate very smoothly. The only thing I did not expect it becomes very stiff to operate (i.e. change orientation, remove camera from the plate) in very cold temperatures. Doable but the normally smooth operation requires a bit of muscle. The carrying bag is very convenient, I am able to carry the tripod on my back as a sling shot when I don't need it. I also found the extra height this tripod provides very handy in some situation.Given all the regulation at the airport I was not sure if they would allow the tripod as part of my carry on luggage along with my other photo gear. It turned out to be no problem at all on a number of trips.I use a carry on bag to store my camera bags and a tripod and the bag did not get any extra examination or questioning.This is a great tripod and a very reasonable price!

Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job. I use the leather conditioner on the leather in my almost 4 year old car, as well as an old comfy leather arm chair. I put the product on the leather, wait a few minutes for it to get absorbed a bit, and then use a micro fiber towel to clean off. The Lexol leather conditioner did a fine job in cleaning and softening the leather.The price on the conditioner in the last twelve month ranged from $11.24 to $7.99, so the price as I write this review is very good. Note on price research: I found a very helpful tool that shows me the history of Amazon prices, you can find it by searching from Amazon price history and pick the one with the camel in the name. I find it very helpful.A quick note on the spray vs cream packaging. In the past I have used leather conditioning creams, so I bought the spray to compare how it would work. I have to say that overall I like the conditioning cream better because I have more control over where the product is applied. This especially the case when I work inside of the home on my leather chair. When I get to the edges I have to be careful not to over spray.

I took up swimming as exercise for my bad back, and these goggles really helped me enjoy it more. My old goggles would let the water in slowly, so it was a chore to have to keep clearing them. Not a problem with these goggles! They fit comfortably, the water does not come in, and they do not fog up. They also hold up well, I have used them for 9 months just about every day and they still work well in all respects.

I really like my Optima lightweight vac - it is great for cleaning stairs and my area rugs. It is easy to maneuver , it is not too heavy, yet has very strong suction.But I hate changing the filters - they are so messy. I have to do it outside on a non-windy day. So having a few spares really helps in several ways. I have used both DCF-10 and DCF-14 filter in my vacuum and they both fit well.Cleaning these filters is very hard, dust gets stuck in the crevices. However, if I wash them with jet stream from the water hose, it is possible to get them relatively clean. So I what I do is take the vacuum outside, remove the filter, shake it out, and then use the jet to clean it. After the filter has been washed I leave it to dry for a while. In the meantime I put another filter in. So I can put away the vacuum before the filter dries out.I found that the price on the on this product fluctuates between $10 and $15. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.

I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden. I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all my requirement perfectly. I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes, it works well in small places, and it gets all the grass in one pass. After two summers I am still using the original string, and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review

I purchased GE Silicone clear cartridge to seal the seam between new deck and the house. I applied in mid November at a temperature about 50 degrees. The next morning it was perfectly set, despite some rain during the end of the day when I applied it.The only glitch: I am not a very handy person, so I am not sure if this is normal or not. When I cut the spout, I had trouble getting the silicone to come out until I broke the seal formed inside of the tube with a small screw driver. The application was easy, the silicone gave me some time to work with it until it set. I found that the gloves were getting in my way, and I used my bare fingers to spread the silicone. I was able to clean up fairly easily with applying rubbing alcohol to my hands after the soap/water round.Update 11/2012A year later I needed to use more clear caulk. I had absolutely no hope that this old cartridge would still be usable but I gave it a try just to see if it was totally hard... and to my amazement a big wet glob came out! It was still pliable and usable.Ali Julia review

Glass measuring cups are nice because they don't discolor like plastic, however I am switching to the plastic cups because of a recent shattering incident.I was pouring hot water into the cup to make jello when it shuttered. The cup is rated microwavable, but I guess it only works well when it is heated gradually. When I purchased the cup there was a peel off warning about heating oil in the cup, but nothing about pouring hot water. Pouring hot water into it was, thinking back, was not a good idea.Old Pyrex bakeware was made out of a glass called "borosilicate", at some point Pyrex changed to a less expensive soda-lime glass. Soda-glass is used in all baking dishes and measuring cups. Pyrex states that soda-lime glass is more likely to break due to temperature changes but less likely to break when it dropped.Hope this helps someone else to avoid the same mistake!Ali Julia review

I did not know these would become my favorites shoes! I normally don't wear clogs. I bought them only I was about to undergo back surgery and I knew putting shoes would have to be easy because I would so limited in my ability to bend. These shoes certainly are easy to put on and off, and in addition they are sooooo comfortable. I imagined that clogs would slip off easily while I walk, but this is not so. They are comfortable and secure on your foot, and easy to take off when you need to remove them.I am looking to buy a second pair.Updated 9/10/11I now own two pairs of Easy Spirit Women's Travel Time Mules. Both are extremely comfortable.I am posting a photo of the black/grey mule. The stock photo shows the shoe darker than it really is (I was hoping to get something closer to black/dark grey), I hope my photo is helpful to show the colors well. The dark colors is better described as dark dark grey and the light color is medium grey.

I first got this book in a library, it was so good that I purchased a copy of my own as I know it will become a reference book for many of my projects. This is my first book by this Nicky Epstein, but when I was in the library I looked through both "Knitting over the edge" and "Knitting on the edge" and "Knitted flowers" and found that "Knitting over the edge" had more projects that looked interesting to me. It also had a nice variety of over the edge, applique, ribs and cords projects where the other two books were more "specialized".I love making unique looking projects, and technique of knitting over the edge really helps me achieve this goal. The patterns may look complex, but they are not difficult and really enhance the look of your knitted pieces.The goal of the book it to show different ways of finishing and decorating the edge of the garment: ribs, fringes, loops, tussles, and more. My favorite are cords. I've never seen the unique approach the author demonstrates of decorating the edge with loops and circles made with knitted cords! I also liked the knitted applique which you see in the cover image.The book is illustrated with wonderful photos, they really make the projects and ideas in your head come alive. The book has 160 pages, and over 350 edging ideas.I really appreciated that the author showed how different techniques look when done in different yarns, it really changes the look and it is helpful to see the outcome on the pages of the book before you try it yourself.My only complaint about this beautiful book that some pages are printed in white font on pink background, and for my presbyopic eyes the contrast is too low to see well. This book is 190 pages and only 5 or 6 pages have a pink background, but unfortunately the table of content is one of them, so I have to strain when I refer to it.Most knitting books contain mistakes, and so does Knitting Over the Edge.You can find correction this way:1. Go to sixthandspringbooks web site (I located it from Vogue Knitting)2. On the bottom left you will see a link for "corrections" (just above "customer service" link)3. When you click on the link it will bring up a page which will allow you to select a book by title/author4. Then you can select "Knitting over the edge"5.

This Mr. Clean AutoDry Car Wash lasts about 4 washes for me. I have to say that I dry the car with a micro-fiber cloth after using the system. I am pretty picky about the water spots and Mr. Clean did not quite do it as well as I can do with micro-fiber towel. It left a bit of spotting especially on the glass and chrome parts. And I enjoy drying the car with a towel, and lets me check for chips or any areas that might need claying.I do like the water gun and the delivery of the soapy water to the where I where I wash because my car is tall and I have to stand on little foot stool to wash the top of the car, this lets me stay up on the stool without running to the bucket with soapy water. So after the initial cartridge ran out I bought a refill.Warning: The water gun with the soapy refill is relatively heavy. Since I began having back problems, followed by back surgery I find it uncomfortably to use it due to weight. However, I hope when my back improves I will be able to use it again. If you have back problems keep the weight of the unit in mind when you deciding on the purchase.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.

This chair was a life saver for me. I had a badly herniated disk in my lower back, and this chair was the only place where I can find a position that was not agony. I have been sleeping in it as well as spending period 5-10 minutes stints to decompress the spine during the day. These short sessions allow me a few minutes where I can sit somewhere else or walk a short distance to get something.A friend loaned this chair for me when I hurt myself, but I am planning to buy one of my own as soon as I am better. Note that I started with a regular size chair, but then my friend brought me the XL version to try out. Since I slept in the chair I found XL more comfortable. XL size gave me an ability to put my hands by my sides without touching the cold metal on the sides.Note I am 5'2" and this chair was easy for me to operate even when almost every movement hurt because of the disk herniation. When you want to recline you need to lightly push up on the lower bar with your feet and with your back on the back of the chair. When you want to get up you need to lightly push with your calves on the canvas and not push with your back on the back of the chair. The chair is basically a lever :-)

I have very hard water. I have tried a large number of toilet cleaners trying to remove the sediment/rust ring. I tried Clorox, CLR, Vinegar, Various Toilet bowl cleaner. Nothing worked. I was embarrassed whenever company came over. When I heard about the pumice stick I was somewhat skeptical, but figured I would give it a try. It took less than 10 minutes to completely remove all the nasty stuff. You just have to see it to believe it. Two split image photos attached: the toilet before and after, and the stick before and after.The pumice stick not only removed the sediment, it was fast and easy to use. As pumice works it crumbles and this grit helps clean the sediment. After the job was finished I felt the bowl with my finger I did not feel any scratch marks.Pumice stones come as a stick without a handle or as a stone attached to a handle. The pumice stick without a handle gives you better leverage, and is cheaper. To avoid small particles coming off the pumice stone getting on my hands I just put on gloves.A-m-a-z-i-n-g!Ali Julia review

For the last couple of years I have been growing a couple of tomato plants on my patio in large pots. Until last year I waited to plant my tomatoes plants until the end of May as cold frosty night we get kill tomatos that are planted too early.Last year I decided to see if I can start growing tomatos earlier by using an umbrella green house. I was not sure whether the umbrella would provide sufficient warmth, as my plants are located on the wooden deck with air circulating in spaces between the wooden slats. If the umbrella was placed on the ground would provide a warmer environment.My tomatoes plants are watered by the drip irrigation system on a timer. The umbrella fit perfectly over the pots as well as the drip irrigation tubes coming into the pots. I left the umbrella on the plants during the days and the nights, lifting only to fertilize the plants every two weeks. If you don't have a drip irrigation system, there is a zipped opening which will allow you to water the plants without moving the umbrella greenhouse. I left the umbrella on the plants during the days and the nights, lifting only to fertilize the plants every two weeks. The umbrella handle comes with a removal stake which can be planted into the ground which I did not use since my pots and umbrella were sitting on a wooden deck. I positioned the stick next to the pot, rather than inside it. And was able to have two plants covered by one umbrella. The plants grew rapidly and survived well through a number of frosty nights we had since early April. By the beginning of May both of my plants had several flower clusters.I was concerned about pollination, since my plants were under an umbrella and no well meaning bee could get to the flowers. After doing a bit of research I found that either insects, wind or hand shaking of the flowers would carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma. I found that some people use electric toothbrush placed near the blossoms to simulate buzzing bees. But I went with a simpler method: shaking the plant gently once a week for self-pollination. The tomato pollen is not in the exterior of the anthers like most flowers but is produced internally and then released thru pores in the anther. Motion is required to release the pollen, and the greatest quantity is released by sonication of the "correct" frequency. When you shake the plant by hand try to mimic the natural resonances of sonicating bee. Shaking should not be violent, just as close to the right frequency as possible. Note that using implement like a cue tip or a brush is not very effective because the tomato's pollen is not on the surface.In the last week of May last year I noticed the first tomatoes on my plants which is pretty incredible for the cold North East! I felt like a proud mother since I polinated the plants myself with a technique described above :-)Update 5/21: I live close to New Hampshire/Massachusetts border. This morning I noticed my first green tomato! The tomato plants are about 3 feet tall and have several flower clusters. A friend of mine and I bought the same variety of tomatos on the same day, but he does not use a pop green house. I visited his house this weekend and his tomatos are still little dwarves compared to mine! This pop-up greenhouse really works

I am a quilter and have a collection of thimbles. This review presents the comparison of the thimbles along with images of how they fit.Clover Open Sided Thimble is made out of soft leather and is very comfortable. It has an opening at the tip, so if you have long nails they can poke through the opening. I like this thimble for comfort, but if I am working with something that requires to push through very hard this is not the best option because it is soft and something with a metal works better.I am attaching comparison and pictures of the thimbles in my collection. In one image you can see the thimbles by themselves, and in another picture of how they fit on my fingers. The numbers in the images correspond to the numbers below.1. Leather thimble with a metal plate (marked #1 in the photos) is my favorite, most versatile thimble. Because it is leather it become shaped to your finger and gets more and more comfortable with use. The metal plate on the tip allows to push through and not hurt your finger. It does not have an opening at the top, so it may not work for those who have long nails.2. All leather thimble (the thimble in this listing) (marked #2 in the photos) is extremely comfortable, but because it has no metal parts it provides less protection. I often use it as a second thimble on the hand to protect another finger because it does not get in a way. It has an opening at the top, so it works for those who have long nails.3. Strip thimbles (marked #3 in the photos) turned out not to be very useful. The leather itself can be penetrated by the needle, the pink plastic insert does protect the finger. However the string that holds thimble together on the back broke very quickly. I was able to repair them by stitching them together on the back to replace the string that broke. As you see from the photo they don't cover the very tip of the finger, so they did not work well for me.4. Plastic thimble provides good protection, but hard plastic makes it a bit hard to work with. So I usually put it on only when my needle is stuck and needs an extra push. It has an opening at the top, so it would work for someone with long nails.5. Thimble #5 is a thimble I made myself out of band-aid wrapped around my finger. I needed to protect my thumb, and my home made thimble worked best. If you have hard time finding a good thimble, give it a try making it yourself out of Nexcare bandages. They seem to hold the shape well, and I could put my home-made thimble on and off, so I could re-use.6. Thimble #6 was a thumb thimble I bought, but I found that it got in the way because it was a bit too long and made my hands less agile. It has no opening at the top, so it might not work for people with long nails.So if you have to buy one thimble I would go with leather thimble with a metal plate (#1 in the photo).Ali Julia review

I have a two zone drip irrigation system, which uses two different timers: this DIG timer and an Orbit 91213 timer. The DIG timer has been in use for 3 summers so far. This DIG timer is better in a number of ways described below.I LIKE:1. Programmable options are extremely flexible. I can complete control on how frequently the watering occurs within one day as well as how many minutes it lasts2. Despite all the options it is simple to use3. It has a manual override if I need to give the plants a little extra water4. It works on one 9 volt battery, I am able to use rechargeable 9 Volt batteries.5. It does not use a lot of juice, rechargeable 9 volt battery is not discharged by the end of the summer6. The time is well built, it long lasting, this will be my fourth summer using this timer7. I have zero leaks from it (I use Teflon tape on each connection)I DO NOT LIKE:1. Changing the battery while the timer is attached is a bit difficult. It is located under the unit, the one time when I had to do it I needed to use a mirror to see what I was doing. However, this taught me to install a fresh battery each spring and I never had to change the battery mid-season.COMPARISON with ORBIT 91213 in side-by-side use1. Orbit programmability is very limited. The minimum time period you can set it up for is every 6 hours. It has to be exactly 6 hours apart, that means it will water 4 times a day. However, I do not want to water in the middle of the night as might promote root rot. What I want is to water more frequently during the day, but not at night. This timer does not give that type of control, where as DIG timer does.2. Orbit timer eats batteries at a very fast clip. It could not last on re-chargeable batteries more than 2 weeks. I had to switch to regular batteries and change them once a month. I went through 3 sets of non-rechargeable batteries last summer (the first year I had a two timer system).3. Orbit timer has a bigger LCD screen, and I find it to be a bit easier to read. This is useful as I need to keep an eye on it to know when to change the battery!4. Orbit time shape (flat) is a little easier to work with when the timer is not mounted.I am attaching a photo of my irrigation system with two timers side by side.Ali Julia review

Overall I am very pleased with this vaccum.I have carpet only on the stairs. I was looking for a vacuum that would work well on stairs: small and light, yet powerful.This vacuum is perfect! Just the right size base, perfect weight, and great handle for the stairs.It also works well on area rugs. I also use it on tile and that works very well as.There is one thing about it that I don't like.Changing the filter is very messy. Since the filters are expensive ($15) I re-use them. But getting the dirt out the filter is so so so unpleasant. And very messy. I only do it outside. It also fills up very quickly (because it cleans well?), so emptying them in the winter is extra unpleasant.Whoever thought that bagless vacs are a good idea is really wrong. I much prefer having a clean little bag I can throw out and pay only a couple bucks for it.I fill up one $15 filter in a few cleanings, and I have very little carpet and very little dirt overall. So if I was throwing them out every time they fill up it would cost a bundle a year!

"Coma" was the first medical thriller I ever read. In parts I was so scared that I had to read with all lights in the house on, for some reason that made me feel better. But I could not put it down.I was fascinated, and since then I read every book Robin Cook wrote. He also got me interested in other books in the style of medical thriller.Robin Cook writes great story lines of suspense in various areas of medical care and medicine science. He novels are scary because they seem plausible. Despite writing many books Robin Cook novels do not repeat and remain unpredictable.Another favorite of mine for this type of thriller is Michael Palmer. If you like Robin Cook, I think you will enjoy Michael Palmer books as well.

My first acquaintance with this book was a random pick from a library shelve of audio books. I recently had back surgery and for exercise I need to walk. I began listening to audio books as an aid for making the exercise more enjoyable. Anthem certainly worked great as an aid that wanted me to keep walking as I did not want the story to end.As the book began I was immediately wrapped in the story. The story felt both like a science fiction and a familiar and recognizable present. The beauty of this work is that it can be internalized in many different ways. For me it was not about the evils of communism, but something much closer and more relatable. I work for a large company and I could see some of what has been happening in the politics of a large company that was happening in the book. The story takes place in society where an individual is not important, the only things that are important are things that are perceived to be a benefit to the society. The society decides what each individual has to do for the benefit of the society. All individuals are the same, all interchangeable, all clogs in a big system.

Before this book I was not an Ayn Rand fan, I heard the name but not much more than that. This was a book randomly picked from a library shelve of audio books. I recently had back surgery and need to walk for exercise. I began listening to audio books as an aid for making the exercise more enjoyable. Anthem certainly worked great for that as I did not want to stop walking to hear the rest of the story.As the book began I was immediately wrapped in the story. The story felt both like a science fiction and a familiar and recognizable present. The beauty of this work is that it can be internalized in many different ways. For me it was not about the evils of communism, but something much closer and more relatable. I work for a large company and I could see some of what has been happening in the politics of a large company that was happening in the book. The story takes place in society where an individual is not important, the only things that are important are things that are perceived to be a benefit to the society. The society decides what each individual has to do for the benefit of the society. All individuals are the same, all interchangeable, all clogs in a big system. Being different, thinking differently was an offence. The society is ruled by the closed minded bureaucrats that go by the rules whether they make sense or not. The story follows the hero who discovers his own self and the strength and creativity individuality brings.This is the kind of book that you want to read more than once.

Bender Ball Pilates is a 40 minute exercise DVD. This is a beginner Level pilates exercise with some advanced options.This is my second Bender Ball DVD, so I am very pleased with its level and clear explanations. I am doing this exercises after serious back surgery and 4 months of physical therapy. This DVD, along with Bender Ball strong back, really helped me to add variety to my exercise routine.The exercises are not so advanced that I could not do them and get discourage, yet leave me plenty of room to improve. This DVD does challenge me leaving me frustrated that I am not able to follow the exercises. I found that I really like using the ball. It provides extra stretch that I would not be able to achieve without it. And in some exercises provides support that lets you do the exercise in a correct manner.After the 40 minute work out my back feels nicely stretched, I can balance better and feel more nimble. I recommend this DVD to beginner level exercisers and especially people after back surgery like myself.

I have a multi zone drip irrigation system, which uses two different timers: this DIG timer and an Orbit 91213 timer. The DIG timer has been in use for 3 summers, this is the 4th summer. I prefer the DIG timer for several reason described in comparison section below.I LIKE:1. Programmable options are extremely flexible. I can complete control on how frequently the watering occurs within one day as well as how many minutes it lasts2. Despite all the options it is simple to use3. It has a manual override if I need to give the plants a little extra water4. It works on one 9 volt battery, I am able to use rechargeable 9 Volt batteries.5. It does not use a lot of juice, rechargeable 9 volt battery is not discharged by the end of the summer6. The time is well built, it long lasting, this will be my fourth summer using this timer7. I have zero leaks from it (I use Teflon tape on each connection)I DO NOT LIKE:1. Changing the battery while the timer is attached is a bit difficult. It is located under the unit, the one time when I had to do it I needed to use a mirror to see what I was doing. However, this taught me to install a fresh battery each spring and I never had to change the battery mid-season.COMPARISON with ORBIT 91213 in side-by-side use1. Orbit programmability is very limited. The minimum time period you can set it up for is every 6 hours. It has to be exactly 6 hours apart, that means it will water 4 times a day. However, I do not want to water in the middle of the night as might promote root rot. What I want is to water more frequently during the day, but not at night. This timer does not give that type of control, where as DIG timer does.2. Orbit timer eats batteries at a very fast clip. It could not last on re-chargeable batteries more than 2 weeks. I had to switch to regular batteries and change them once a month. I went through 3 sets of non-rechargeable batteries last summer (the first year I had a two timer system).3. Orbit timer has a bigger LCD screen, and I find it to be a bit easier to read. This is useful as I need to keep an eye on it to know when to change the battery!4. Orbit time shape (flat) is a little easier to work with when the timer is not mounted.I am attaching a photo of my irrigation system with two timers side by side.Ali Julia review

I recently had a serious back surgery and it is painful to do any chore that requires me to bend. This upright broom and dustpan allowed me to clean without bending and hurting!I use it to on tile and hardwood floor. The pan makes good contact with the floor, so the dirt gets into the pan not under the pan. No need to chase after the dirt multiple times. It is also easy to carry, you just tilt it and the dirt stays within the pan - no spilling!I am 5'2", the broom is 36 inches high, and this is a comfortable height for me. The dust pan size is 8 3/4 inches. The weight is just under 2 pounds. I am very pleased with this set and would recommend it.

Taste-wise both I and my husband find the taste of Splenda to be an acceptable substitute to sugar. It is sweeter than sugar by volume. Normally I take two teaspoons of sugar in my coffee or tea. To get the same sweetness I would use one tea spoon of Splenda.However, my husband noticed that his prostate is significantly more irritated when he uses Splenda. He tried on a number of occasions stopping and then restarting Splenda while changing nothing else about the diet or daily activity and the symptoms (frequency, burning, stream issues) were perfectly correlated with Splenda consumption. His doctor confirmed possible relationship. He no longer uses Splenda and the irritating symptoms has not returned.

"How to Succeed" was written in 1896. The book aims to provide inspiration that would help a person to succeed in life.Each chapter starts with quotes from various famous people making a point relevant to the topic of the chapter. I really enjoyed the quotes. These quotes are probably the best part of this book.The book does not reveal any big secrets about how to succeed, rather it provides inspiration for being successful. It suggests not to lose your individuality, be able to stand up for your convictions, to find a way to improve on methods people use and finding that something special that is in demand will propel you to making a fortune.Some of the language in the book is rather sexist, for example here is a paragraph from "Seize Your Opportunity":"Of thousands of young women trying to get a living at typewriting, many are so ignorant, so deficient in the common rudiments even, that they spell badly, use bad grammar, and know scarcely anything of punctuation. In fact, they murder the English language. They can copy, "parrot like," and that is about all."When you read old books you notice how the society changed. It makes you feel good that something like that is not likely to be accepted if it was written today.Table of content:Be a Man,Seize Your OpportunityHow Did He Begin?Out of PlaceWhat Shall I Do?Will You Pay the Price?Foundation StonesThe Conquest of ObstaclesDead in EarnestTo Be Great, ConcentrateAt OnceThoroughnessTriflesCourageWill PowerGuard Your Weak PointStickSaveLive UpwardSandAbove RubiesMoral SunshineHold Up Your HeadBooks and SuccessRiches Without WingsOverall, it was a quick and easy read.

I thought MAXELL button batteries were a great value. The price and shipping on this product seem to change but seem to always work out to be around 20 cents per battery. However there is a reason why they are such a good price! They don't last.I bought these batteries for my old scientific calculator which requires 2 button batteries. The calculator was running on the original set of batteries for about 15 years.I installed two batteries on 7/6/12. Originally, I was pleased with the batteries. However, this review is written 3 month later and I am no longer happy. I use the calculator once a month for 10 minutes or less balancing my check book when I do monthly bills. On 9/30/12 weekend I found that the calculator was dead. I always turn off the calculator, but even if I have forgotten it turns off automatically after 1 minute of non-use. The batteries lasted 3 months, total of 3 uses, under 30 minutes of total active use. Since the previous set of batteries lasted for years, I can only give these batteries 1 star.Ali Julia review

I have a large collection of grippers (different manufacturers and lengths) due to back problems, and Unger has the best ability to grip and pick up a large variety of objects. I can pick up objects as small as a sewing needles as well as large as big heavy cans.36" Unger Nifty Nabber is available for $20 at Home Depot, but this shorter version seem not to be available in retail stores. 18" grabber is easier to control and can be used in tight quarters (such as taking things out of the washing machine). I suspect this will become my most used grabber, replacing the current favorite its 36" longer brother.Note that the color of the handle of the 18" Nifty Nabber is red, not green as shown in the image.

I love my Light tracer! It produces nice bright light without being blinding to look at. The surface of the box does not get hot, so you can work with it for a long time.I use it to transfer my drawings onto fabric for quilting and embroidery, and it works beautifully.10" by 12" size does not limit me to that size artwork. It is easy to transfer larger drawing by doing them in pieces. I just shift both the drawing and the fabric, since it is so easy to see through fabric and drawing to re-align them once you move to the next section.The light box is light and stores away neatly. The cardboard case that it came in is sturdy and has a handle. The box is easy to store it away and take it out when you need it.

A few years ago we had to undergo Chlorination treatment after we detected contamination of the water supply. I could not stand the taste of the Chlorinated water and decided to try if Pur filter is going to remove that unpleasant taste. It absolutely did! Since then even though we no longer need chlorination I continued to use the Pur Filters.After about 2 years the unit that attaches to the faucet cracked and I had to replace it. I have very hard water so I think it is not unreasonable to replace the holder every a couple of years.Each filter has a little light, which turns red when Pur recommends you replace it, but I found that the better indicator is either the taste. I can usually get an extra month or so from each filter after the red light indicator comes on. After that the flow of water decreases to the point of being annoying. However,I found that if I slightly unscrew the filter (without removing) and then screw it back on, it resets internal mechanism which shuts of the flow of water and I can get more use of each filter. I can tell when the filter is spent by taste. I think both the light and the decreased flow are a gimmicks to increase the rate at which you buy new filters.I typically use the 6 pack refill, as it works out to be a better deal per filter.PUR MineralClear Faucet Refill RF-9999 6 PackOverall I am very pleased with the Pur Filter system. It solved my problem with the bad taste, it easy to put on and replace filters, and it is a reasonably priced solution.

I bought this handle to make my bathroom safer after back surgery. I have it attached to the edge of the tub next to the toilet, and it helped to lower myself on the toilet seat.My tub is one of those plastic one piece tubs that go high to cover the walls. I attached it to thoroughly washed edge of the tub. To have a secure seal I needed to wet the edge when I attached the handle. When I did not wet it, it came off in several days. But the wet seal holds extremely well.I have a similar larger handle attached on the wall of the shower (to help exit and enter the shower), and it also has an excellent seal that lasted 3 months without coming off. Again, attaching it to a somewhat wet wall was the trick that made it stick really well.

I needed one of these gizmos after back surgery, when I could not bend or twist. This gadget does not work well in the back because the ball of toilet tissue is to thick to get into the crevices. I found that another Bottom Buddy worked much betterIdeaworks Long Reach Comfort Wipe. It works just like a hand, without having a big mop at the end of the wand.I bought several Bottom Buddies and noticed that its price varies from $6.50 to $19.99 (while eligible for free shipping too). So it is a better solution at a better price.

I've had this Ironman watch for approximately 10 years. So why am I compelled to write a review now?Because I just received a superior service from Timex that warrants a write-up.After 10 years of faithful service the wrist band on this watch came off on one side.I looked up where I can find a replacement and found that Timex will replace the band on its watches for free.I called the 800 number and sure enough, they told me to package it up, write a note that it is for band replacementonly, told me to enclose a check for a very modest shipping cost to send it back to me.This was four weeks ago, and my watch just arrived back in superio shape. New band, and the back looks shinier. Lookslike they cleaned its exterior as well.I owned several Timex watches in the past, but this one has been my favorite.1) I like the nice clear large display. Easy to see even with my now presbyopic eyes.2) Setting the watch is easy without a manual3) There is enough useful features, but not so many that the it makes it too complex to do simple things4) Even though it is a men's watch I a female who wear is and I don't find it heavy or bulky5) I like the plastic watch band. My previous Timex had a Velcro band and eventually it picked up a lot of lint it did notclose well. And now that I found that Timex will replace it for a cost of shipping it back, I am even more pleased with it.6) The battery lasts a reasonable time, I have to replace it every 2-3 years. Not often enough to be annoying. Thebattery in my "dressed-up" watch lasts only a year.I am very pleased with the watch, and now extremely pleased with the service as well.

"Going for gold" takes place in at 1948 Olympics in London and is a story of one of the three gold medals won by the British. Six weeks before the games the British sculling was burning with the desire to win a gold medal and did not think any of the current teams could do it. They put together a new team of two men who from different worlds - a boat builder's son Bert Bushnell and Oxford educated Richard Burnell. They had different approaching to sculling strategy and life which they had to overcome to win a gold a medal.I enjoy watching sports and the premise of the movie sounded interesting to me. I found the movie to be Okay (not bad, but not something I would watch again). I did not find it as compelling as Chariots of Fire which has a similar story line. The conflicts in this story were simple, predicable in both content and resolution. I never felt fully connected and vested in the characters. On the positive side I enjoy watching Olympics and knowing that it is based on a true story made this story more interesting.The DVD comes with the feature film as well as 1948 Olympics Trivia Game, which I really enjoyed even though it ranked me as "Rubbish". It was quite educational and the ranking trully reflected my lack of knowledge of Olympic history of that period. The movie runs approximately 90 minutes and has optional English subtitles.I received a review copy of the DVD to write an honest and unbiased review and this review reflects both both pluses and minuses of my experience watching this movie.Ali Julia review

I ordered this battery on the weekend and received on Wednesday. The price was less than it would cost me at a local Radio Shark. The battery fit my remote control perfectly. It works, good price, fast and convenient delivery. What else can you ask for?I use this battery in a remote control for my camera (the remote takes 2 of these lithium batteries). I had my camera for about 6 years, and this is my third set of batteries. I don't use the remote all that frequently so mostly the time frame shows how long the battery holds its charge without much use. I got three years out of each set.

I like this can opener! My favorite feature is the magnetic lid holder. With the older can opener I often had to fish out the lid from the can, but not with this opener. The magnet arm catches the lid to prevent it from falling into the food. And you can keep your hands clean and cut free (from experience... cuts by metal lids really hurt!) by disposing the lid directly into the trash can by pressing the magnet arm to release.The can opener itself is well constructed from die cast aluminum and feel indestructible. The blade is sharp and is made out of stainless steel, and it cuts the metal of the lid easily. I found the handle (labeled #1 in the photo submitted to customer photos for this listing) comfortable to hold and a soft turning knob is comfortable to turn (labeled #3 in the photo). The lock (label #2 in the photo) that attaches is to the can holds the opener firmly in place.I hand wash the can opener per OXO recommendations.Overall, easy to use tool and is a big improvement over my old can opener.Ali Julia review

I recently became interested in weaving which uses a lot of relatively expensive yet simple wooden tools. I was able to make some of the tools myself and became interested in making more complex wooden tools for weaving (and spend my money on buying yarn!) Since I have not had any experience in woodworking this sounded like a useful book to check out. And I was not disappointed!Written in 1910 but much of it content that relates to tools and techniques is still relevant today. The publication begins with the discussion of logging, starting with preparing for the logging,felling of the trees, floating the wood to its destination, saw milling, seasoning the wood, and storing lumber. The first 3 chapters cover these topics in great detail. Even though I did not find them relevant to my interest, I found the details both impressive and interesting.In chapter 4 the author starts the discussion of hand tools. Each tool and the technique of using it described. The book contains no images, but the descriptions are so detailed that it is possible to follow without the images.In Chapter 5, the author proceeds to wood fasterning, covering everything from nails and screws to hindges and locks.If found a chapter of joints quite interesting. Being new to woodworking I did not realize there were so many.Chapter 10 covers wood finishing. The author discusses types of stains, advantages of each, a bit of history where they came from, and of course, the techniques.The author is clearly a master craftsman with an ability to explain what he knows. I am very impressed with this book both in the amount of information and the clarity of explanations. Much of it content is still relevant today. It certainly helped me to determine which tools I need to buy and some of the techniques for using them.

I purchased this sprayer for olive oil so I can control the amount of oil I use in my cooking. So far I have been very pleased with the mister.I am attaching a collage of two photos which I will be referencing in this review. The photos show the mister disassembled as well as next to a pen for size reference.The mister is a little larger than I expected from the stock photo: it is 9" tall and the diameter of the bottom is 2 7/8" (see image labeled #1). The bottle is made out of an aluminum tube and the rest of the parts are plastic (see image labeled #2). In the second image you can see the mechanism that creates the pressure for misting. Left-most is the cap that holds the comp to the bottle, second from the left is the white knob that secures the pump to the bottle, the third is the mister itself, and right-most the container.Before the use you need to pump the cap several times, 10 pumps give you about 14 seconds of spray. If you need more spray you repeat the pumping. The spray is very fine, the pump operation is very smooth.In order for the spray to work well1) Fill the container half way2) When you are done spraying release the pressure of the white knob (you will hear a hissing sound) then tighten it again3) Put the cap back on until you feel pressure but don't push beyond that point (otherwise the pressure will buildup again)I store the bottle on the counter, with the cap not totally down as described in step 3. This prevents clogging and prolongs the life of the mister.When the spray mechanism eventually gets clogged I clean it with De-solve-it Desolv It Citrus Solution 12 oz, which is a non-toxic cleaner and works well to dissolve oil clogs.Ali Julia review

For the last couple of years I have been growing a couple of tomato plants on my patio in large pots. Until last year I waited to plant my tomatoes plants until the end of May as cold frosty night we get kill tomatos that are planted too early.I started with the seeds, which I germinate on a dinner plates covered with wet paper towels, and then covered by another dinner plate. This technique produces very reliable good results.Last year I decided to see if I can start growing tomatos earlier by using an umbrella green house. I was not sure whether the umbrella would provide sufficient warmth, as my plants are located on the wooden deck with air circulating in spaces between the wooden slats. If the umbrella was placed on the ground would provide a warmer environment. My tomatoes plants are watered by the drip irrigation system on a timer. The umbrella fit perfectly over the pots as well as the drip irrigation tubes coming into the pots. I left the umbrella on the plants during the days and the nights, lifting only to fertilize the plants every two weeks. The umbrella handle comes with a removal stake which can be planted into the ground which I did not use since my pots and umbrella were sitting on a wooden deck. I positioned the stick next to the pot, rather than inside it. And was able to have two plants covered by one umbrella. The plants grew rapidly and survived well through a number of frosty nights we had since early April. By the beginning of May both of my plants had several flower clusters.I was concerned about pollination, since my plants were under an umbrella and no well meaning bee could get to the flowers. After doing a bit of research I found that either insects, wind or hand shaking of the flowers would carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma. I found that some people use electric toothbrush placed near the blossoms to simulate buzzing bees. But I went with a simpler method: shaking the plant gently once a week for self-pollination. The tomato pollen is not in the exterior of the anthers like most flowers but is produced internally and then released thru pores in the anther. Motion is required to release the pollen, and the greatest quantity is released by sonication of the "correct" frequency. When you shake the plant by hand try to mimic the natural resonances of sonicating bee. Shaking should not be violent, just as close to the right frequency as possible. Note that using implement like a cue tip or a brush is not very effective because the tomato's pollen is not on the surface.In the last week of May last year (2010) I noticed the first tomatoes on my plants which is pretty incredible for the cold North East! I felt like a proud mother since I polinated the plants myself with a technique described above :-)I am attaching a photo of tomato plants under the umbrella, that allowed me to get an early start on the season.Update 5/21/11: I live in the Northeast, close to New Hampshire/Massachusetts border. This morning I noticed my first green tomato! The tomato plants are about 3 feet tall and have several flower clusters. A friend of mine and I started growing tomatos on the same day, but he does not use a pop up green house. I visited his house this weekend and his tomatos are still little dwarves compared to mine! This pop-up greenhouse really works!

My basement has a lot of peg wall storage and these hooks amended my existing collection of hooks and attachments. I was pleased with the quality of the hooks, they don't bend under the weight of the items I had put on them.This 32-piece collection consists of 16 hooks and 16 locks. I use them on 1/8 peg work and they work very well. The hooks stay in very well.In the last year the price on this item fluctuated between $1.90 and $3.49, so the current price $3.49 is at the high end. I found a nice tool that shows the history of Amazon prices and sends you an alert when the price of your choosing is reached. You can find this tool by searching on Amazon price history and selecting the tool that has the word camel in its name.Ali Julia review

I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review

What a difference a washer makes! It turned my leaky spitting garden hose into a well behaved no leak hose! These washes are made from high quality rubber. They are easy to install and fit the hose perfectly. They are more expensive than the cheap washers that you can pick up at a home improvement store for a couple of bucks, but I think they will last longer and in the long run will not be more expensive. I have hard water and had to replace the flimsy washers every year.

I have been a big fan of GooGone for a long time. In my experience nothing removes glued on stickers better. And it does not damage the product, even if it a book - once it dries there is no stains.I also used GooGone to remove marks on painted walls and stains on the wood floor without damaging either one. The only thing to keep in mind when using GooGone is that it does not work instantly. You need to soak the area and leave it for about 5-10 minutes to penetrate. Then the sticker, goo, or dirt comes off easily. If it does not, just add a little more and give it a bit more time.I am down to just a small amount in the bottle I have been using and it is time to buy a new bottle. The Amazon price seemed a little high to me so I checked the Home Depot and an 8 oz bottle (same as this item) is $3.48.So I highly recommend the product, but the price is worth shopping around for.Ali Julia review

Due to various medication taken for herniated back and subsequent surgery my stomach has been giving trouble. My doctors told me to take Prilosec to protect my stomach from the effects other medications are having on it. I started taking it last year, and it really helped.Prilosec (omeprazole) belongs to a group of drugs called proton pump inhibitors. Omeprazole decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach. Prilosec is used to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and other conditions caused by excess stomach acid. It is also used to promote healing of erosive esophagitis (damage to your esophagus caused by stomach acid).Prilosec should be taken only once every 24 hours for 14 days. It may take up to 4 days for full effect.Last year I bought Prilosec OTC as a regular over the counter drug. But this year I found that my insurance has a special benefit for this specific medicine. My medical insurance is covering Prilosec OTC with the rate of $5 co-pay for 42 tablets (which is less than a normal co-pay for prescription medicine). I needed my doctor to write a prescription and specify the OTC packaging of the drug to qualify for the benefit. This information about this coverage came in the provider's quarterly newsletter and was not well publicized otherwise. Check with your insurance if you happen to have this coverage as well.

I am having trouble reading menus at restaurants, so when I saw this little gadget I thought it would be perfect.Something that I can fit into my wallet and be there when I need it. I thought it was such a good idea I bought three of them, one for me and the other two for a couple of friends with the same problem.Owl was a disappointment. This magnifier produces very dim light, it lights a very small area. The magnifier is not of a high quality and combined with the dimness of the light it becomes very hard to use. Imagine reading a menu one word at a time. You need to constantly move the magnifier around. It was rather tedious. But I could have lived with it when I was desperate. However, after a few uses the light totally died.When I checked with my friends on their Owls... and they had the same problems!Good idea, but bad execution!

I am a big fan of Ken Follett, I read every single book he wrote. I was excited to find this book written early in his career, a book I have not read before. But I found it boring. It was the only book of his that I have not finished. Some day I might take in with me on vacation where I would be forced to finish it by not having any other options...

I have several silk dresses I want to keep in great condition for the next special occasion. The light in the closet can cause fading of silk garments and ruin the color. Storing in a opaque, breathable garment bag is exactly what a nice silk dress needs!This bag worked very well for me. I was able to fit several dresses in one bag (same hanger) to make it more cost efficient. A side benefit that the dresses take up less room in the closet.Ali Julia review

When news of BPA in plastic bottles hit the news, I began looking for alternative for water container to take to work. At my office the tap water has an unpleasant taste, and I am much happier bringing water with me from home.I used to use plastic bottles, but they leach BPA (which some studies show increase risk of breast cancer,prostate cancer,diabetes, and heart decease). Some aluminum bottles are lined with epoxy resin that leaches BPA.The best options are stainless steel and glass. Stainless steel is lighter, and that's why my choice is Klean Kanteen.Klean Kanteen is light. It is made out of a thin metal sheet. It has a bamboo lid. Threading is part of the bottle neck. The Kanteen opening is rather large, and it is easy to drop ice cubes into it. I find it is comfortable to drink from. I dropped my Kanteen quite a few, and it stood up well to abuse. It has several small dents, but still closes tightly and does not leak.I would happily buy another Klean Kanteen if I needed another water container.Ali Julia review

This is a great book that provides both teaching of the techniques as well as beautiful photographs which will inspire you in your own projects. This was one of the first quilted landscapes books that I read, and I still use many of the techniques are picked up in this book.The book in divided in 7 major sections.1. Supplies and materials, which goes over the tools that the read will find useful when working on their own quilts.2. Basic Methods, such as marking the pattern and assembly. This was a great foundation for my award winning works. It is clearly written and very helpful.3. Gallery. A wonderful section with many landscape quilts. This is a gallery, no patterns for each work.4. Embellishing the landscape. Another great chapter discussing things other than thread and fabric that can add interest to your art work.5. Projects. This section gives patterns and instructions for 6 lovely quilts.6. Other embellishments to try. More great ideas on embellishments. Some clever and unique ideas!7. Putting it all together. This section talks about how to select and create a pattern from a photographOverall, very good book which I continue to come back to as a reference. It is clearly written with has some unique idea. I recommend it!

I am a big fun of Ken Follette, and Jackdaws is definitely among his books I really enjoyed reading. This a World War II espionage novel, the action happens just prior to the Invasion Of Normandy. His historical account is both vivid and interesting, and I had hard time putting the novel down. When I finished it, I wish there was more - always a good sign! I recommend it.

I love lemon marmalade. I use lemon jam when cooking as well straight out of the jar with my tea. Lemon marmalade is pretty hard to find on the store shelves in USA, so I was excited when I found this jar in gourmet store in Rockport, Mass.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.Meyer Lemon Marmalade is a true marmalade not a jello. It has thick lemon chunks through out. In the photo you can see the its deep brown color, thick and beautiful top to bottom. This is in contrast to some other lemon marmalades sold on Amazon: Thursday Cottage Lemon Marmalade (ASIN B007O0IJE8) which it is not a thick jam all through out but has a good amount of fruit especially at the top and Fruitfield Little Chip Lemon Marmalade (ASIN: B000BSWIQA) which is a jello not a marmalade.Meyer Lemon Marmalade is not ultra sweet (good!) but not very tart. I prefer my lemon marmalade a little tarter. Meyer Lemon Marmalade and has a bit of tang of bitterness from the rind and a little bit of mint flavor. Mint is not listed as an ingredient, so perhaps it is just a bouquet of other flavors that remind me of mint. Overall I liked it, although it was not the best lemon marmalade I ever tried.Here is a list of ingredients:Meyer lemonsSugarLemon JuiceNutrition Facts for serving size of 1 tablespoon (15g):16 servings in the jarCalories 40Total fat 0Sodium 0Total Carb 10g (3%)Protein 0gSugars 10 gAli Julia review

Bogen Manfrotto multiclip is a very useful gizmo. I use this clip not only for photography but around the office as I found many uses for them.The multiclip consists of two 3-inch-wide spring-loaded clips connected by a U-shaped metal bar. The clips can rotate around the bar, and provide enough friction to hold any the position you leave them in. I use one clips of the multiclip as an anchor to clip to something (photo stand, photo reflector, shelve, table lamp) and the other clip to hold something I need. I have use the multiclips (I have two of them) to hold either cards to reflect light forming "barn doors" on my light, hold a color gel, hold a background fabric, or for a non-photographic use to hold a piece of paper to prevent reflections on my monitor.The clips are not strong enough to hold heavy objects, but they work great for paper, cardboard, photo gels, and background fabric. If I were to buy a photo light with real "barn doors" it would cost me a lot more money than by home-made barn doors with the use of these clips.These Manfrotto Multiclips are very handy and I recommend them!Ali Julia review

A few years ago we had to undergo Chlorination treatment after we detected contamination of the water supply. I could not stand the taste of the Chlorinated water and decided to try if Pur filter is going to remove that unpleasant taste. It absolutely did! Since then even though we no longer need chlorination I continued to use the Pur Filters.After about 2 years the unit that attaches to the faucet cracked and I had to replace it. I have very hard water so I think it is not unreasonable to replace the holder every a couple of years.Each filter has a little light, which turns red when Pur recommends you repla few extra months from each filter after the red light indicator comes on. After that the flow of water decreases to the point of being annoying. However,I found that if I slightly unscrew the filter (without removing) and then screw it back on, it resets internal mechanism which shuts of the flow of water and I can get more use of each filter. I can tell when the filter is spent by taste. I think both the light and the decreased flow are a gimmicks to increase the rate at which you buy new filters.Overall I am very pleased with the Pur Filter system. It solved my problem with the bad taste, it easy to put on and replace filters, and it is a reasonably priced solution. This six pack refill is the best deal for refills.

I bought this microwave in a retail store(on 10/8/10), but always come to Amazon to read reviews no matter where I buy things. So I decided to add my review and keep it updated as other helpful folks did.Pluses:1. Excellent roomy size2. Light for its size (30 pounds, very important to me for moving and disposal without asking for help3. Clear and easy controlsNegatives:So far none, however I read from other reviews that the inverter (the technology that it allows it to be lighter than other microwaves of this size) tends to burn out after a couple of years. I will keep this review updated if such thing occurs.

I love this steamer! It is easy to use, easy to clean, and it gives consistent and tasty results. I started using it for steaming vegetables but it did so well that I expanded it use into other areas.I also use it to steam rice and even warm up left overs (it keeps them really moist). The only issues for doing left overs that the plastic does gets stained a bit if you use tomato-based sauce or curry in the dish.If there are left overs I use the steamer to store leftover in the refrigerator (I put a piece of plastic under the cover for a better seal).I found so many uses for it, that I bought a second one! Sometimes I use it for more than one things at the same time and I just wanted to have a spare just in case.

I love Pollenex shower heads, they have a unique to them design - a setting which is a slot. It provides excellent massage, better than any other shower head I have tried. With a hand held shower I use the that setting not only to shower, but to clean the tub and fill container with water.I find them to be durable I get about 12 years out of the previous one. I have very hard water and needed to replace only because it got plugged up. This replacement happened in November 2010, and that shower head is still working perfectly. No leaks.I recently bought a new one for the guest bathroom and noticed that the model I bought in April 2012 has a different arrangement of the holes. It still has my favorite slot, but it is somewhat thinner. The other holes have pretty different hole arrangement. I am attaching a photo of both heads side-by-side for comparison under customer photos. I still like it, but it feels a little different.For installation with no leaks: I use Teflon tape on every connection and hand tighten (not tools) not to crack the plastic.Ali Julia review

I am a quilter and have a collection of thimbles. This review presents the comparison of the thimbles along with images of how they fit.Clover Coin Thimble is made out of pliable leather and is very comfortable. It has a metal plate at the tip, which can be used to push through needles with strength without hurting the tip of your finger. This is my favorite thimble, and I own two of them as I often use it in two fingers (second and third) at the same time.I am attaching comparison and pictures of the thimbles in my collection. In one image you can see the thimbles by themselves, and in another picture of how they fit on my fingers. The numbers in the images correspond to the numbers below.1. Leather thimble with a metal plate (marked #1 in the photos, this is the product in this listing) is my favorite, most versatile thimble. Because it is leather it become shaped to your finger and gets more and more comfortable with use. The metal plate on the tip allows to push through and not hurt your finger. It does not have an opening at the top, so it may not work for those who have long nails.2. All leather thimble (marked #2 in the photos) is extremely comfortable, but because it has no metal parts it provides less protection. I often use it as a second thimble on the hand to protect another finger because it does not get in a way. It has an opening at the top, so it works for those who have long nails.3. Strip thimbles (marked #3 in the photos) turned out not to be very useful. The leather itself can be penetrated by the needle, the pink plastic insert does protect the finger. However the string that holds thimble together on the back broke very quickly. I was able to repair them by stitching them together on the back to replace the string that broke. As you see from the photo they don't cover the very tip of the finger, so they did not work well for me.4. Plastic thimble provides good protection, but hard plastic makes it a bit hard to work with. So I usually put it on only when my needle is stuck and needs an extra push. It has an opening at the top, so it would work for someone with long nails.5. Thimble #5 is a thimble I made myself out of band-aid wrapped around my finger. I needed to protect my thumb, and my home made thimble worked best. If you have hard time finding a good thimble, give it a try making it yourself out of Nexcare bandages. They seem to hold the shape well, and I could put my home-made thimble on and off, so I could re-use.6. Thimble #6 was a thumb thimble I bought, but I found that it got in the way because it was a bit too long and made my hands less agile. It has no opening at the top, so it might not work for people with long nails.So if you have to buy one thimble I would go with leather thimble with a metal plate that is for sale in this listing.Ali Julia Review

I am a quilter and have a collection of thimbles. This review presents the comparison of the thimbles along with images of how they fit.Clover Leather Thimble set is made out of hard leather on top and plastic insert under it (the pink part). It is comfortable to wear, but the string that holds it together broke the first time I tried to use it (I was able to fix it by sewing it together).

I use Fiskars paper edgers to decorate 'thank you' notes that I include with my art work. I got a lot of compliments on the packaging! They add a little touch of unexpected care for the recipient and make it more fun for me to create a special package.They are durable, I use them on weekly basis and they still do a great job cutting. I like that each one has a different color as it makes it easy to tell the different edges apart (plus there is an image of the edge on the scissors themselves). I find them comfortable to hold and work with them for a long time.Since the stock image includes the photo of the edge only, I am attaching a photo of the scissors.This scissors are made for a right handed person.

Lasko 3300 fan is sold under several slightly different names but with the same model number and description. At the time of writing this review the best price is on this oneLasko 3300 Fan.We have central air conditioning but only one control unit downstairs, so the second floor is always warmer and less comfortable than the first floor. I tried putting fans at the bottom of the stairs to the second floor to improve air circulation but the air did circulate well my old fans as they could drive the air up the stairs. Purchasing this pivoting fan made all the difference! This fan immediately help drop the temperature upstairs by about 2-3 degrees.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.I LIKE:------1. The best feature of this fan is the pivoting ability of the fan. The fan pivoted and held its position straight out of the box, I did not need to adjust or tighten anything. Photo #1 shows the fan pivoting, Photo #4 and photo#5 show two views of the fan at the bottom of my stairs.2. Photo #3 shows the fan on the digital scale. The fan is fairly light just under 7 pounds and 2 oz.3. I like handle on the top of the fan. It makes it very easy and comfortable to carry it around.4. The fan is fairly quiet even on the high setting. It producing no rattle noises of any sort, the sound you hear is white-noise type sound of blades pushing the air. It is so quiet that on a number of hot nights I took that fan into the bedroom. I am a light sleeper yet the noise from this fan did not bother me even as I was trying to fall asleep.I DON'T LIKE:-------------1. Minor: the switch to turn on the fan in the center back of the fan. So when you pivot it up you need to reach under the fan to turn it on or off. Close-up of the switch is shown on Photo #2.2. Minor: the length of the cord is 6.5 feet. I wish it was longer. I have to use the fan with an extension cord.Overall, I am very pleased with this fan and it quickly became my favorite fan of the 4-5 fans we have in the house: it pivots for great air flow control, it is powerful to quickly cool a room, and it is quiet to do its job without being noticed.Ali Julia review

The tailors chalk has been used for a long time and it still works so well! I've tried a few modern inventions (chock pencils and such) but the tailors chalk still works the best! Whether you are shortening pants or skirts, making a new garment, or working on a quilt it leaves great clear marks and lasts a long time.I find it to be an indispensable tool in my sewing tool box. I highly recommend it.

I am replacing the old GladWare containers that I had in use for a few years.They are just the right size to take lunch to work, and they close so tightly thatnothing spills. Those are the two main requirements I have. Pretty simple, but Ihad to try a few containers until these two simple requirements were met perfectly.The old set still closes well, but became kinda grimy looking from being used everyday for a couple of years. Not bad for a "disposable" container.I happy to replace them with a new set.Updated 5/12/2011I saw these containers in a local super market for a *lot* less. So figured I will add this price alert to check a local grocery story before ordering.

I have been using GE Energy Smart bulbs for over a year and overall I am pleased with them in my kitchen light fixture, and not pleased with them as an outdoor porch light.Kitchen:There is a noticeable delay in turning them on in the kitchen fixture, but within 1 minute the lights come to full brightness. This is a fixture that is turned on at least 4-5 times a day, staying on at least 15 minutes at a time. All three bulbs lasted over a year so far.Porch:I live in the North East where the winters are cold. The cold has significant effect on the brightness of the lights. The delay turning them on is longer and at some low temperatures they never come to full brightness.Selecting the lights:I am used to associating Watts with brightness, however Watts tell you the energy the bulb consumes not its brightness. Lumens is the measurement that measures brightness.I found this handy table that I bring with me when I look for replacing bulbs with spiral CFL450 lumens = 40-watts bulb800 lumens = 60-watts bulb1,100 limens = 75-watts bulb1,600 limens = 100-watts bulbColor is a different dimension, the higher the temperature the lighter the color. The temperature is measured in Kelvins. Incandescent bulbs produce warm yellowish glow, if you l like that color look for 2,700K. Halogen light produce light at 3,000K. 3,500-4,100K produce bright white light. 5,000-6,000K produces day mimics daylight. Different manufactory use different words to describe the color of the light, so use the temperature to be sure what you are getting.Ali Julia review

I have two areas with ice dams - the top of the dormer and a the steep lower roof.RoofIce Dam Breaker makes a big heavy ice stock. It you can safely get it to the roof it works fine. However I needed to solve the ice dam problem after 60" of snow already fell, make it impossible to get on a ladder safely. Raising the big stock full of salt to the top of the dormer roof turned out to be very difficult. I was able to put it on top of the ice dam on the steep lower roof, but it slid off under its own weight. The sock is too heavy to stay on roof with steep angle. However, I found a solution that worked for both of my problem areas.I took a nylon stocking, filled it with calcium chloride to form a sausage about 4" long. To make it easier to fill the stocking I took a 16 oz yogurt container and cut out its bottom. This made a nice sturdy funnel which kept the top of the stocking wide open for pouring the calcium chloride.I tied the top of the stocking onto itself and then tied it to a garden thread so I could retrieve the stocking later (who wants a roof full of stocking?). The thread turned out to be helpful on my failed attempts, when the sock wound up in the bushes and I had to pull it out and try again.Then I took an extension pole used for a roof rake. I replaced the big rake with a small brush so it would be easier to hoist it up to the level of the roof of my dormer where my major ice dam is located.My first few attempts were to fold the sock over the brush and dump it on the roof. But that did not work as either the stocking fell before it reached the desired spot, or I could not disengage the brush without knocking the sock down.Finally, the solution that worked was using the pole and the brush as a lever. I put the thread attached to the sock over the brush, and raised the brush to the roof positioning it where I wanted the sock to be located. The stocking meanwhile was laying on the ground. Then, using the brush as my lever, I pulled on the thread to raise the stocking to the roof. This worked very well the first time I tried! [see attached customer image]My second problem area, is the steep lower roof. I could not get even a small stocking to stay on the lower roof as it has a very steep angle. However, my dormer windows are above the ice dam, so I suspended a stocking with ice melt on a thread from a window. [see attached customer image]I also want to make a note that the nylon gets stuck to the ice. When I tried repositioning one of the socks it would not budge. The gravity makes it drops when the salt melts the ice around it, but repositioning the sock to another spot turned out to impossible because it is stuck to the ice, and pulling it might tear the stocking dropping all the salt at once rather than via slow release.24 hours later I saw that the ice stocking built a channel. I can see the trapped water coming out of the channel. [see attached photo of the same ice dam 24 hours later]The idea behind this method is not to melt the entire ice dam, but to give water an outlet from under the ice dam. So all you need is a small channel. The water will go where there is the less amount of resistance.2/28/2011Another update after yet another snow storm.This time I put the sock on the roof of the dormer before the snow. Today as the snow began melting (and normally this is when my problems begin), I noticed that the biggest icicle is formed right under where the sock is placed on the edge of the roof. The unexpected bonus is that the salty water from this big icicle is dripping on the lower roof and pouring into the rain gutter. The rain gutter (which in the past was totally uncased in ice) did not freeze right under the big salty icicle, thus allowing the water to drain into the gutter.

I've been using Avery labels for my label needs for many years. The best thing about Avery labels that they stick on very well, smoothly, without puckers. I use the lables also with the colored ink jet printer and black and white laser printer. The paper quality is good and there is no blurring of ink when used with ink jet printers. Laser printer results are excellent as well.I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and can't fill the entire sheet. However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes, even when some labels were alredy peeled off. o avoid labels sicking to the printer I flip the sheet and have the part that has no peeled labels go first. This really helps me to save money and only print what I need without waste.Avery redesigned the label sheet to reduce wasted paper. Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels. Despite less of a hold on the labels I am still able to feed the paper through twice as described above.There is a large variety of free templates for use with Avery labels, all you need to know is the number of the label to get the right template. Using templates I get perfect results with several different word processors - no waste, all labels get printered and perfectly aligned.You can't go wrong with Avery labels.Ali Julia review

The pump does the job! For a small 9" inch exercise ball it takes almost no effort at all, for a larger ball it is a bit more work but not too bad. The pump held up well through several pump up sessions.The hardest part of pumping up the exercise ball is removing the air stopper from the ball. If someone has a trick on how they do it, I would love to hear it!

This is a measuring cup with a long "snout". It makes reaching and transferring wet (or dry!) ingredients to difficult to reach areas such as the food processor and mixer so much easier. It also makes it easier to pour batter on the griddle or muffin tray with very little mess. I also use it to fill bottles with juice/tea for trips.This is a very convenient gadget.There is one "con" in the product, the measuring numbers are very hard to see. They are done in the same color as the rest of the surface (just impressions) and if you have pres-biopic eyes you just can't see the markings without putting your reading glasses on.

I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking. Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well! I like the flavor of Oyster mushrooms and JR Mushrooms brand has an excellent quality.To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the water boiling. Then let them cool. If some of them are still hard to cut I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft. Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.They are easy to use in many different ways. They taste great sauteed in butter. I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken. I also found they go great with any Indian sauce, like Pataks:Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 OzMushrooms, what do they taste like:* OYSTER - mild, slightly nutty* PORCINI - sweet, nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms, but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos* ENOKI - very delicate flavor, slightly crunchy if fried* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor* SHIITAKES - rich, almost beefy flavorJR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price. I recommend them!Ali Julia review

I have an AT&T; cordless phone. I have replaced its batteries in the past, and never had a problem until the battery in this listing. This battery's description matched my CPH-505 Ni-MH rechargeable battery 3.6V 700mAh AAA, yet when it arrived the fit felt a little loose and the phone generated "Check battery" warning when I plugged in to recharge. I checked that I installed it correctly (I did). I left it with a flashing "Check battery" warning overnight in case it just meant that the battery was totally out of charge, but 16 hours later the phone was still generated that warning.I generated a return voucher from Amazon. The form instructed me to return the battery and pay for the shipping. The form said I will be reimbursed for return shipping based on Amazon's estimate (emphasis one estimate) of shipping for this item. I will update this review when the reimbursement process completes.Updated 12/28/11.This morning I received a notice from Amazon that they received my return.This evening I received a notification that a refund has been issued. The refund is for the item and for the return shipping. The estimated shipping was actually slightly higher than I paid to ship the item.Needless to say I am very pleased with how Amazon handled the return. I guess that's why Amazon is my first stop shopping. Thank you, Amazon!

I am a big fan WrightSock design - I have a total of 9 pairs of these socks! The double fabric design works great to prevent blisters and absorb sweat. I use this socks as every day socks. Without them I get blisters just from regular walking, with these socks on I do not.Size small of Wright socks fits my shoe size 7 feet perfectly. I have small feet and most small size socks stretch after a few washing and start bunching up at heel or toe, but not these socks!These socks are high quality and they last. My oldest Wright socks are about 5 years old and still no holes or visible thinness, on my laundry rotation schedule I wear each sock once every 2 weeks.I am attaching a collage of 4 photo number 1 through 4 under customer photos:Photo #1 shows the sock next to the ruler for size referencePhoto #2 demonstrates the double fabric designPhoto #3 shows the height of the sock on my footPhoto #4 shows the size chartMy favorite socks!

This book will want to you to go and hug your mother if you are lucky enough to still have her around. This is a beautiful, poignant story about a son and his mother.The son has an accident and somehow in the haze of the accident is having a vision of one more visit with his mother, and revisits various periods of his child hood. I found especially touching the thoughts which he titles "Times when I did not stand up for my mother". He remembers all those little things in live where he could have done some-thing a little different and probably would if he only had one more chance. The story is delicate, nostalgic and warm. It is written in a very intimate way, as if you are listening to someone's thoughts. It is a beautiful story and I recommend it.

I was looking for a no-frills hose caddy. This caddy fits the bill at a reasonable price. This is a metal no-frills hose caddy. I noticed that some reviewers mentioned that in their experience this caddy rusts. So when I received the caddy I closely examined its finish. I see why it rusts prematurely: the finish has many imperfections and bare spots. I am attaching a collage of 4 photos (they can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo) outlining several areas of defective finish. I painted the caddy with a clear coat acrylic paint before using to keep it rust free longer. The caddy came without mounting hardware. On the positive side it is very sturdy.Here are the dimensions of the caddy:It has 10 inches spanIt is 5.5 inches wide3.25 inches from base to railOverall the design, sturdiness and price were what I was looking for. But I deducted a star for poor finish which required me to paint it before use.Ali Julia review

Ibuprofen is my "go to" pain medication. I find that it helps me more than other over the counter medications. It is a pain reliever as well as anti-inflamation medicine. It helps me with migraine headaches, back pain, and cold head aches. Ibuprofen is the generic drug name,and is the active ingredient in Nuprin, Advil and Motrin. In large amounts it can cause stomach problems, but when I take 2 tablets twice a day for a short period of time I don't have any stomach issues. When I was put on a large amount of Ibuprofen to attempt to reduce swelling caused by raptured disk, it did become a problem and I had to add Prilesec to my regiment to deal with the stomach issue. In general it is best to take this medicine with food or water to protect to stomach lining.Kirkland's Iburpofen has the best price I found for this product. The bottles typically have a pretty far away experation date, so I manager to use them all before they expire.I noticed that the price on this product fluctuates significantly (from $8.99 to $20.00). I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.Ali Julia review

I love post-it notes! They have so many uses. This cute has small post-it notes, just under 2 inches by 2 inches. I use them as markers in the books, cook books, manuals and notebokes.They help keep me organized. I like that they come in different colors, so I can color-code my bookmarks.They provide enough room to write a small notation, but this size is not very good writing notes as there is not a lot of room. But they are perfect for marking!

I am not very a very handy person, so my tool box did not have this tool until this weekend. I have pretty weak hands, after a recent back surgery I lost even more ability to put torque on things. This spring I had trouble with losing hoses from the garden caddy, tightening a shower head so it would stop leaking, and a few other house hold chores like that. Someone suggested that I get vise grips.They work amazingly well! All my little chores were done in a matter of seconds, without requiring a lot of strength from me. I just wish I had this tool in my tool box earlier!

This tool is unique due to its triangular shape and slightly con-caved form to follow the windshield slope. The triangular shape allows the tool to get into low sloping areas where the windshield is near the dashboard. How well it cleans depends on the material used on the tool (microfiber is best for no streak clean). It does require a couple of swipes to get the glass totally clean, but it does not require a lot of effort.I found this tool so convenient to use that expanded its use from the inside of the windshield to the outside of the windshield and the sunroof. I am fairly shot and cannot reach the sunroof as well as some windshield portion of the outside glass of my SUV without the aid of a step stool. I found using this everywhere really speeds up the cleaning.The tool comes with three covers: a mesh one (good for removing bugs) and two micro-fiber (no streak cleaning). Because I use it everywhere I added a couple additional microfiber sleeves of my own.I purchased high quality microfiber towels and using my sewing machine attached strings (I actually used shoe laces cut in half) to all four corners of the micro towel. This allows me to tie the "sleeve" to the head of the tool (see attached photo under customer photos).Recently I found yet another use for this tool. I purchased Griot's garage glass clayGriot's Garage Glass Cleaning Claywhich removes deposits from the glass. I was able to use this tool to rub clay against the glass where I could not reach the glass by hand. This tool worked well because it is not totally flat but con-caved to follow the slightly sloped glass of the windshield, so it worked very well to hold the clay ball.Thumbs up for this tool!Ali Julia review

After a recent surgery I needed an accurate easy to use thermometer to keep an eye on my temperature to guard against infection. I already had a digital stick thermometer which took temperature in the mouth or underarm. I decided to buy an infrared thermometer thinking that it might be better and easier to use.Both were accurate within 0.5 F. I compared them with the medical thermometer when visiting nurse came to check on me.DIGITAL STICKIt gives a reading in 8 seconds and beeps if you have a fever. It has a flexible tip and comes with extra interchangeable tips for different family members or body parts (mouth or underarm).EXERGEN TEMPORALThis thermometer takes a temperature in 1 second, all you need to do is swipe it across your forehead. It beeps when it is done.I learned not to worry if my body temp isn't 98.6 F. Your normal might be higher or lower, plus your temp can fluctuate up to 2 F in a day. Take a reading when you're not sick to see what your normal is.Both types of thermometers did a fine job. Infrared is faster and a bit easier to use, the digital stick a lot cheaper.Ali Julia review

I love the taste of the nuts. I like them out of the box as well as mixed in with cooking just about anything.The only down side is that I have to taper my love due to calories: 1 ounce of nuts has 170 calories (130 from fat).In a recent Consumer report I found an interesting statistic on content of Planters Nuts. The following percentages are averages from analysing three containers of Planters nuts.48% of all nuts are peanuts24% of all nuts are almonds15% of all nuts were cashews6% of all nuts were brazil nuts4% of all nuts were hazelnuts3% of all nuts were pecansNote on price: Price compare the price for 2 pack of 32oz Planters nuts. There are several packaging of Planters nuts available, and per ouch price sometimes is better on the smaller container. In general, I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.

Dritz Slip-Stop Thimble is a traditional metal thimble. I find that metal thimble is a bit too cumbersome to work with. My fingers are not as nimble with this thimble on. A metal thimble was the first thimble I ever used, and when I was not totally satisfied with it my collection of thimbles began to grow.I am attaching comparison and pictures of the thimbles in my collection. In one image you can see the thimbles by themselves, and in another picture of how they fit on my fingers. The numbers in the images correspond to the numbers below.1. Leather thimble with a metal plate (marked #1 in the photos) is my favorite, most versatile thimble. Because it is leather it become shaped to your finger and gets more and more comfortable with use. The metal plate on the tip allows to push through and not hurt your finger. It does not have an opening at the top, so it may not work for those who have long nails.2. All leather thimble (marked #2 in the photos) is extremely comfortable, but because it has no metal parts it provides less protection. I often use it as a second thimble on the hand to protect another finger because it does not get in a way. It has an opening at the top, so it works for those who have long nails.3. Strip thimbles (marked #3 in the photos) turned out not to be very useful. The leather itself can be penetrated by the needle, the pink plastic insert does protect the finger. However the string that holds thimble together on the back broke very quickly. I was able to repair them by stitching them together on the back to replace the string that broke. As you see from the photo they don't cover the very tip of the finger, so they did not work well for me.4. Plastic thimble provides good protection, but hard plastic makes it a bit hard to work with. So I usually put it on only when my needle is stuck and needs an extra push. It has an opening at the top, so it would work for someone with long nails.5. Thimble #5 is a thimble I made myself out of band-aid wrapped around my finger. I needed to protect my thumb, and my home made thimble worked best. If you have hard time finding a good thimble, give it a try making it yourself out of Nexcare bandages. They seem to hold the shape well, and I could put my home-made thimble on and off, so I could re-use.6. Thimble #6 was a thumb thimble I bought, but I found that it got in the way because it was a bit too long and made my hands less agile. It has no opening at the top, so it might work for people with long nails.So if you have to buy one thimble I would go with leather thimble with a metal plate.

I have a large collection of grippers and grabbers (different manufacturers and lengths) which I acquired after a serious back surgery. No single grabber was good for every job I needed to get done. I only realized this after the surgery, when I was well I bought just one figuring it would do everything I need.Unger grasping mechanism has the best ability to grip and pick up a large variety of objects. I can pick up objects as small as a sewing needles from the floor as well as large as big 32oz cans. It has no problems picking up and holding small pieces of paper. An ability to pick and hold a small piece of paper that I dropped is something that I needed frequently, yet not all grabbers are capable of holding a thin object. And nothing was more frustrating as picking up and dropping things over and over. It emphases the physical limitation that caused you to use the grabber to begin with.36" Unger Nifty Nabber is available almost everywhere including Home Depot for $20. However, for some jobs I needed a shorter gripper. For example when I needed to operate in tight headquarters a long gripper is very awkward to use. Also when I was using a gribber to help me get dressed a shorter grabber put me into a more natural position while giving me extension. 18" Unger grabber is hard to find in local stores, but Amazon carries itUnger NN40R 18" Nifty NabberAnother well used grabber in my house is Duro-Med 32 AluminumDuro-Med 32 Aluminum Reacher with Magnetic Tip. It does not work well grabbing very small or very large objects. However its gripping mechanism is very slim so it fits into tight spaces, and it requires very little force to operate, so it is good for a repetitive task. I use it when I do laundry to get things from the bottom of the washing machine which I can't reach otherwise. Even though my back is better now I still use it every single time I do laundry because it works so well. Note that I tried using my 18" Unger grabber for this job and it was much harder: it did not fit as well into the washing machine and gripping over and over for 50+ laundry items tired my wrist out.For majority of the tasks, Unger Nabber is a very good solution. Its ability to pick up small things is unparalleled.Ali Julia review

I purchased this walker after back surgery and used for every step for several weeks. It was lightweight and with tennis balls on the front feet slid nicely on different surfaces (rugs, hard floors, paved road).One major flaw the the walker had original is that the foam hand grips were hard, and my hands became raw and red within 10 minutes.However, I came up with a cheap solution. I bought a small piece of black pipe insulation similar toM-D Building Product 50154 Indoor/Outdoor Pipe Insulation - Black (Pack of 40)at the home improvement store, and taped it to the top bars. Not only did it make the grip nice and soft it also increased the area I can use as the grip, and sometimes I held the walker close to me that the original grip position.With this slight improvement I really liked the walker. Although until I came up with this innovation I was very concerned that I would not be able to walk as much as I needed for my exercise after surgery, not because of my back but because my hands would become raw first.

I use (and lose) a lot of lens cleaning cloth. I use them for my eyeglasses, to clean the glass on my tablet, as well as my camera lens. I was attracted to this cloth because of the low price and decent reviews.Overall, I am satisfied with how this cloth cleans, however you need to wash it first to remove specs of fiber that are probably the result of cutting the big cloth in the small pieces.This is a well sized cleaning cloth (7 inches by 6 inches), so it is easy to keep your fingers away from the glass surface. It removes smudges quite well.The cloth works best with regular cleanings, this removes any dust or debris that might have accumulated on the cloth. I just rinse it under the running water and dry - no need to run it through the laundry.Eyeglasses cleaning works best if I wash the glasses under warm water with a drop of dish detergent, and then use this cloth to dry the glass.To preserve the lenses of the eyeglasses my eye doc gave me sheet with some no-nos that I am sharing below:1) Do no wipe lenses with tissue, paper towels, or paper napkins. They have a rough surface and can scratch the glass.2) Do not use vinegar, glass cleaner, and other things you use for house glass cleaning because these cleaners damage the eyeglasses coating3) Do not use spit. It is convenient, but contains testaments that are harmful to glasses coating or can scratch the glass4) Exhaling on the glass is better than spit, but does not get the lenses wet enough in most cases5) Avoid wiping the lenses when totally dry. If there are specs of dust the surface or in the cloth they may scratch the glass6) Do not leave glasses on the dashboard, as the windshield will act like a magnifying glass and increase the heat the glasses are subjected toAfter washing the cloth I am satisfied with this lens cleaning cloth and would recommend it.Ali Julia review

This trimmer works very well. I recommend it.What I liked:1. It cuts well, both the "fuzz" and thicker hairs.2. It is very discrete. It looks like a pen. I am attaching a couple of photos of the trimmer next to a pen, so you can see for yourself.3. It is easy to control. By that I mean that that the profile of the tip is small, and you can treat very small areas, such as between your eyebrows.4. I am using a single rechargeable AAA battery in it. I've been using it for a few weeks before writing this review, and the battery is still going strong.5. The battery is very easy to replace, the battery door slides nicely.6. The package includes an extra heads (which allow to trim eyebrows, i.e. they leave hair with a certain length)7. The package includes a small brush for cleaning the head (you are supposed to clean it dry, not wet)8. The product feels solid, well designed, and well made.What I did not like (very minor, stating for completeness of the review)1. The description mentioned a pouch, but it was not included in the packageI found a cute little bag from jewelry beads which fit the extra heads and the brush to keep them all together.Ordering refill blades:The fine hair blade (the long one that is installed when the trimmer arrives) has a part number WES2113P3708.The cost of the replacement blade is $6.64 plus shipping if you buy it directly from Panasonic web site.You can find them by searching on the part number. I noticed that other vendors sell the refill for the cost that is almost equal a whole new trimmer on Amazon, so in that case a new trimmer would be a better bet.A note on price. I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.Update 5/26/2012It is now a year later and I am still very pleased with the trimmer.I decided it was time to change the blade, and it turned out to be a little tricky, so I am adding a photo under customer photos that should help.In the photo I show how the trimmer comes apart, and how the blade fits.To change the blade you need to pull down on the tab on the base part of the trimmer's head (visible and marked on the photo). Then if you push on the head you can open the head. When it opens up the blade is attached to the half of the head that can be removed. To replace the blade you replace the entire half of the trimmer's head. The white stem visible in the photo need to line up with a hole on the blade, this is what holds the blade in the right position. Once two parts are lined up together you need to slide the tab back up.It actually works very well, and it is nice that you don't need to touch the "naked" blade directly.

I travel with a lot of gadgets that require recharging, so the first thing I check out in a hotel room are the outlets. With Outlets to go I don't have to worry if there are enough and if they are positioned conveniently.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos under customer reviews that I will be referencing in this review.This power strip has a dual-side design, each side has two outlets (Photo #1 and Photo #2 show both each side next to a ruler). The strip if 6 inches long, just under 2 inches wide, and weights 6 oz (photo #5 shows the strip on postal digital scale). The cord is 10.8 inches long (see photo #4) and wraps around the the strip length and plugs into itself when not in use (see photo #3). This makes into small neat bundle without sharp points. All these features make it perfect for taking along when travelling.The outlet on the strip are very well spaced out. Photo #6 shows two of my Sanyo Eneloop recharges side by side fitting perfectly next to each. Photo #7 shows my Samsung Galaxy Tablet charging next to the Sanya Eneloop recharger with plenty of room to spare.This is such a well designed strip that I now use it not only when I travel but also everyday for the rechargers I use every day. I used to do my charging on a circular charging schedule, but with this strip in play I no longer have to worry about the charging schedule.A note on price: there are several listings for this 4 outlet Monster product with different prices and shipping costs so price compare.Excellent product! I highly recommend it, and not just for travel!Ali Julia review

I like keeping my crafts organized and find this organizer very helpful. Overall I am satisfied with it, even though it has several things that could have been better.I am attaching a photo collage of 3 photos which I will be referencing in this review.The organizer arrived with no protective packaging, no instructions, and no mounting hardware.I did not see any dividers in the package. Only when I was taking photos for this review did I notice that the back of the organizer has plastic dividers molded in the back, so if you want dividers you can cut them off. Since the organizer draws fall out when you tilt the organizer forward you need to remove the dividers before you fill the compartments with stuff. See photo #3 to see the photo of the back of the organizer. Note that the number of the dividers are much smaller than the number of compartments.As I mentioned earlier the organizer came without any mounting hardware. The spacing between mounting holes is 18 inches, so you cannot place both holes into studs spaced 16 inches apart. Photo #2 shows the hardware I purchased separately to mount the organizer on hollow walls. #8-10x1" bolts with anchors worked well.There is a total of 64 compartments. Photo #1 shows a close-up of one of the draws with a pen inside for size reference. The compartments are 2" wide, 5.5" long, and 1.5" deep.The compartments can be taken out fairly easily which I find that handy when I need to use the content. I wish the compartments were a little longer (6" would have been perfect). Akro-Mils makes several versions of this organizer: one with all small compartments, one with all large compartments, and one half large and half small compartments.I LIKED:1. Organizer is helpful to keep small items orderly2. Wall mounting saves space, I placed behind the door in a wasted space otherwise3. Each bin can be easily taken out and put backI DID NOT LIKE:1. No mounting hardware, no template for making holes in the wall2. No instructions - I noticed dividers just by chance because I was writing this review and taking photos3. Would have preferred slightly longer compartments (6 inches rather than 5.5 inches)Overall, I am pleased and would buy this organizer again if I had to do it over again.Ali Julia review

My main application for the clamps is quick set up for threading my weaving loom. I use two quick-grip handi clamps and two C clamps. This can usage, of course, can be generalized to any application which requires to hold things in place.The quick-grip handi-clamp clamps are very easy and fast to set up (and remove). They have a decent hold however they the hold is not as strong as the C-clamps that you need to ratchet. It is important for me that the clamps don't move in case I accidentally bump into them and they do not. However if I want to I can move them slightly without releasing the clamp. By comparison C-clamps do not move at all without releasing the tension.I am attaching a photo of my weaving set up: handi clamps hold the metal bracket to the table, while the smaller C clamps attach the rigid heddle to a think wooden stick, which is in turn clamped to the metal bracket.This set up allows me to reach the heddle from both side for threading. This home-made set up cost well below $20, if I were to buy a commercially made system it would be measured in hundreds.The clamps are easy to set up and remove, easy to pack up for storage when not in use, and I am extremely pleased with the clamps. I have been using them for approximately 9 months at least once a week, the springs still work as well as they day I bought them.Ali Julia

I use this light tent to take photos of my own craft arts and it does a very nice job. Defused non-directional light produces good results and shows off my items to their best.I use it on the table, while the two lights are located on the floor using floor light stands. To locate and keep the best angle inside the tent I use a lot of small wedges and some putty, so I can steady the item once I find the perfect angle for the photo. I have several different color cardbox squares that I use as the floor of the tent. Depending on the color and material of my objects sometimes it is better to use a contrasting color. The squares have non-reflective matte finish. Black square looks particular well with glass as it shows off edges.Some other useful features of the light tent: alligator clips for holding backdrops and removable bottom so it can be placed over stationary objects.Lastolite is easy to set up and when I am done it folds up neatly into its own case.Overall, I am very pleased.Ali Julia review

I purchased several pieces of Cuisinart bake ware when it was on sale in a local cooking store. They looked beautiful on the shelve and the silicon grips looked like a great idea.Unfortunately, in practice, I had a problem with each piece of bake ware.The silicon grips began melting starting with the first use. After cooking I would find small black junks laying at the bottom of the oven. After several uses one side melted so much that I was able to remove it, as I did not want silicon crumbs in the oven. The other side is melting as well, but at a slower right.I am attaching a photo (under customer photos in the top left of the main page) with the melted handle so you can see what happened to it.I had similar problems with the other Cuisinart bake ware pieces I bought at the same time. The cookie sheet is totally unusable because it twists in the middle of baking and the content lays on uneven surface, this pan at least is still usable. I am surprised and disappointed. Cuisinart name used to mean high quality to me. That's why I was willing to pay a premium price for the items. But this time the higher price was not worth it.Ali Julia review

Sometimes you need a phone that can work when the power is out. This basic corded phone works without needing electric power.I've had this phone for many years and it still works fine, never a single problem. The sound it produces is very clear. The speaker works fine, although the sound is a bit of a echo on the listener's side. You can control the speaker volume, as well as the ring tone, which can be set to high, low, or off.It is great to have a reliable phone which I can use in power-out situation.

The good news that I thought the taste of the shakes was not bad (I have tried both chocolate and vanilla).However the products gives me the runs. I have tried it a few times hoping it was a fluke, but no... I get uncontrollable diarrhea after the second shake.My suggestion, when if you are trying this product for the first time do not leave home for a few hours after the first several times you try the shake in case it gives you the same side-effect as it gave me. I was not able to complete either of the containers, as the side effect was too severe to deal with.

I love this pen! It fits anywhere, takes less place than solution/wipes, works very well.I use it to clean the lens, the filer, the LCD screen... and even my glasses! I use both ends, but the rubbery end is magic!

I like Kleenex Tissue, when I have a cold they are the easiest on the nose. The tissues are strong and hold up well to abuse. They don't have lotion or scent. And the box is attractive with a low key design.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.

I was a little concerned reading other reviews about getting old stock batteries, but my batteries are 2011 stock (date appears on the back of the blister pack). The package contains two new 3V Lithium Energizer batteries in a blister pack (foil back). The packaging was different from what is shown in the stock photo, which shows a cardboard/plastic package.CR2032 is a large button type battery (6/8" of an inch in size). This is a battery that needs to be purchased separately to power Dabidsbeenthere Luggage ScaleDavidsbeenhere: Portable Travel Digital Luggage ScaleIt fit and is working well. I am attaching a photo of this battery being inserted into the digital scale for reference.I will keep this review updated with longevity of the battery.Ali Julia review

In this order I received Scotch 3M tape (3/4 inch wide and 66 feet long) in a plastic storage container. I attached a photo of the tape and the container which can be found by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.I always have electrical tape in my tool box. Electrical tape does a nice job preventioning shorts, which can start fires as well as stop electrocutions if the live wire is touched by someone. I use it on various wire-related small projects I do at the house.Electrical tape can too old. How can you tell? I noticed that my old tape became tacky on both sides and lost some of its elasticity. I purchased this new tape and was quite pleased that it came in the plastic container. I already used the tape on a project, and it is nicely tacky and holds well.Electrical tape is applied to a wire by rolling the tape the wire in a coil-like fashion. It is important to overlap each layer so there are no gaps to ensure good insulation and to keep moisture or condensation from reaching the wire. While wrapping the tape I pull on it slightly so its elastic property is engaged. The tape's elasticity helps keep it tight and snug to the wire.Electrical tape comes in several colors. Black electrical tape is most common, it does not indicate any color code. It can be used outdoors as it impervious to ultraviolet radiation, which can damage colored electrical tape. White or grey used to indicate neutral wires, green or yellow/green stripe indicate grounding wires.The tape works well, I like the container, the price is reasonable. I am very pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review

Since I began needing reading glasses, I appreciate inventions like big eye needles more and more. It certainly saves time when you need to thread them. These are nice needles and they are easy to work both threading and quilting.

I often have dry lips and have been using ChapStick for years. Recently I got a bit bored with the old reliable choice and tried several different lip balms. I experienced significant difference in satisfaction with them, and I thought a comparison between them might be useful to others.The original Chapstick provides a very good moisturizer, it spreads well and provides long lasting effects. The flavor however is not exciting and that lead to this experiment. Blistex raspberry lemonade has a strong but nice flavor. When you just put it on it taste like a burst of lemon and raspberry almost like licking a candy. This strong flavor does not linger however, it mellows out pretty quickly. I liked the flavor, but found that the moisturizing effect on my lips did not last as long as some of the other balms. It also has more many chemical ingredients than the other lip balms. My most favorite turned out to be Burt's Bees Mango Butter. It provided a very good moisturizer for my lips, which was long lasting. The mango flavor is very pleasant yet light. Mentholatum Natural Ice had a flavor that I really did not like, it was hard to spread, and the moisturizing effect did not last.________________________________________________________ChapStick, Original ChapStick, Original--------------------------------------------------------Taste:.................Light almost not noticableEffect:................Long lastingStick:.................Fairly soft and easy to spreadSunblock:..............NoneCost:..................1.40 per stickIngredients:...........Active Ingredients: Padimate (1.5%), White Petrolatum (44%).

Very handy tape! Since it is more expensive than plastic tape I only use it when I need to write something on the package or when recycling packing materials I need to cover up the old writing. I equally likeJVCC FPPT-01 Kraft Flatback Paper Packaging Tape: 2 in. x 60 yds. (Brown)- so I pick which ever one has the better price.I was about to buy this item on Amazon, when I was in Staples and noticed that it has a better price.

This chair is a life saver for me. I have a herniated disk in my lower back, and this is the only place where I can find a position that is not agony. I have been sleeping in it as well as spending period 5-10 minutes stints to decompress the spine during the day. These short sessions allow me a few minutes where I can sit somewhere else or walk a short distance to get something.A friend loaned it to me but I am planning buy one of my own as soon as I am better.Note I am 5'2" and this chair is easy for me to operate. I think the people who had trouble operating it did not do the following: When you want to recline you need to lightly push up on the lower bar with your feet and with your back on the back of the chair. When you want to get up you need to lightly push with your calves on the canvas and not push with your back on the back of the chair. The chair is basically a lever :-)

I recently purchased this rack to help me organize my threads spools and bobbins. The rack is well made and not flimsy. No dowels came out after about 6 months of active use. It helps me organize my threads in a nice neat way. It can hold thread spools of different sizes, and I can also fit two bobbins on each dowel. Note that the dowels are too short to hold the large spools.The reason I am not rating it 5 stars is that I wanted to hang it on the wall and it did not have any hardware that made it possible. I tried putting on my own hardware eyes on it, but it was impossible. You can not put the rack down flat because you would break the thread dowels. I wound up hanging it by making loops with a cord, which I hung on the hangers attached to the wall, but it looks ugly. It would have been so easy to add loops at the factory just give the consumer an option of how to use it. I was a bit annoyed that they did not think of this.Other than that it is an excellent rack. The quality of construction is better than the other thread racks I have tried in the past.

Rotary cutter is one of my favorite sewing tools, and I use it a lot. I also use it to cut paper, and trim photographs. A fresh blade makes cutting so much easier! One pack of rotary blades and a sharpening toolRotary Blade Sharpener- For 45mm Bladeswill probably be last you a long long time!Once I notice that a rotary blade is leaving one or two threads uncut I put it in the sharpener, and give it a few twists. First on the coarse side, then on the fine side. This really works! It works especially well if you don't wait until the blade becomes really dull. It helped me save money and have one pack of rotary blades last a long time.

The battery on my 15 year old Black and Decker cordless drill (bought in 1997) stopped holding a charge. I still use this drill when I need to use 1/2 inch drill bit because my newer lighter drill does not take the 3/8 chuck needed for 1/2 inch drill. So instead of buying a new big drill I decided to try a new battery. I was not sure if the replacement battery will work in such an old drill, but it did.The new battery is slightly larger than the old drill (see photos of the two batteries side by side under customer photos) but it fit my old drill just fine. So good to have the old power back!I was pleased that I was able to save some money by replacing a battery rather than the entire drill. Under customer photos I am including a photo which shows the old drill as well as both batteries side by side.Ali Julia review

I was looking for trash bags to fit the small trash canNine Stars Touchless Automatic Motion Sensor Trash Can, Set of 2. The trash bin of the small can measures 11" height x 9" width x 5" depth, and I found that this 4 gallon trash bag fits it perfectly.I am attaching 4 photo collage under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.Not all trash bags product descriptions list the exact dimensions of the bags, only the volume, so until I purchased the bag I was not sure how good the fit was going to be.The trash bag measures 18" by 17" (see photo labeled G1). The Glad bag has pretty good thickness, in photo G2 you can see my hand inside of the bag and you can barely see my hands outline.I also purchased Ruffles 4 gallon trash bags. They are sized 18" by 16.5" (see photo labeled R1). As you can see in photo R2 they are much thinner than Glad bags, you can see my hand inside the bag very well. I also could not find unscented version of Ruffies. The ones I purchased are scented with "Vanilla cream". It is not too strong, but noticeable, and I prefer unscented Glad bags.So overall, I like Glad bags better than alternatives, however current Amazon price is surprisingly bad. After reading other reviews I went to a local grocery store as suggested by other reviewers and purchased 30 bags for $1.49 cents, which works out to be 5 cents per bag.This 5 star review is for 5 star product, not the price.Ali Julia review

I have dry eyes that require me to put drops in several times a day. At its worse my eyes were so dry that I had trouble opening my eyelids in the morning, they were stuck to my eyes. I have tried a large number of eye drops, which helped me with various degrees.My favorite eye drop is Refresh Tears Lubricant Eye drops in a bottle. It does not irritate my eyes, it provides a long lasting effect, it does not blur my vision when it is applied. It works equally well during the day and night. I buy smaller bottle for travel, and use the 1 oz larger bottles at home/work. Both small and large containers are great - they dispense the same perfect drop size every time. Whether the container is full or nearly empty the drops come out easily and always the same size. I only can guess that the container is empty by weight or when I get nothing but air bubbles :-)Refresh Tears Drops for Sensitive eyes single use vials work very well. They have no preservatives and are better for sensitive eyes, however they are more expensive the Refresh Tears in a bottle. Each vial has 4 drops. So I feel I am wasting the money if I use it just once. It is possible to re-close the vial for a second use the same day, but only if you can place the container somewhere it will not be disturbed, since the closure is pretty loose. I use these when my eyes are particular sensitive.Refresh Liquigel blurs my vision, and when I wake up my eyes a covered with crusty residue of the gell. I don't like it. The packaging of Liquigel looks very similar to Lubricant drops, and at least on one occasion I bought the Liquigel by mistake after I already knew it did not work well for me. I hope this warning helps someone to avoid the same mistake.Systane lubricant drops irritate my eyes, they become hot and itchy and the eyes need almost constant lubrication. I don't understand why this happens, I don't have any allergies. I have tried this lubricant several times, because my doctor likes it and offers me samples at every visit.GenTeal Librican Oitment blurs my vision after application, so I can only use it at night. When I wake up my eyes are crusty with the residue of the lubrication.Genteal Lubricant Gen Aqua does not irritate my eyes, but the effect of the drop seem not to last. I need to reapply these drops much more frequently than Refresh Tears.Murine Lubricant Drops do not irritate my eyes, but the effect of the drop seem not to last. I need to reapply these drops much more frequently than Refresh Tears.Visine drops are very inexpensive and work well in my eyes, but my eye doctor told me not to use any lubricant that has `get the red out' in the name. He said it has extra medication to constrict blood vessels in the eye, and he said such drops should not be used for every day use.About a year ago, my doctor suggested that I try taking 2 triple omega oil pills a day, as he found it really helps eye dryness. I was sceptical, but figured I would give it a try since fish oil has other positive effects. 2 weeks later I really began feeling a difference, my eyelids are no longer stuck to my eyes in the morning. A year later I am still using the omega pills. I still use eye drops, it just does not feel as urgent when I wake up.Ali Julia review

I use this brush to blow dry and style my hair. This brush has all wood handle, it feels comfortable in my hand, and feels solid. The bristles are made out of a mix of boar bristles and nylon bristles. The bristles are relatively stiff, but not as hard as metal bristles of some brushes, and I find it pretty gentle on my scalp. I like that the bristles have no knobs which I found tangle and tag on my hair.Passing on a tip I got from my hairdresser: she told me to never to brush my hair when it is very wet. It is better to wait a bit until it just slightly damp. When hair is plumped up with water it has an ability to stretch like elastic, but it if you pull it too far it will snap. She told me to use a wide-tooth comb if I need to comb it right out of the shower.I really like the results I get with this brush, I recommend it!Ali Julia review

I recently had back surgery and was not allowed to take showers for a number of weeks. Sponge baths worked ok for the body, but washing the hair was a problem as chances of getting the water on the scar (and thus risk of infection) were high. I was miserable not being able to wash my hair until someone told me about No-rinse Shampoo.Small things make a big difference when you are hospitalized/recovering from surgery. No-rinse shampoo removed one of the things that was making me feel bad and I am so pleased someone told me about it.

My long light coat became permuted with the smell of smoke and I decided to try Woolite dry cleaning sheets to see if I can get rid of the smell.I am attaching a photo of the cloth in my hand under customer photos. Each cloth is a fairly thick moist sheet that can be used to rub out any stains and then tumbled in the dryer on medium heat for further cleaning. The cloth feels slightly oily, the cleaning solution is oil-based. The heat of the dryer activates the cleaning vapor in the cleaning cloth. This vapor penetrates clothing fibers and removes odors from smoke and perspiration. The vapors clean without shrinking, fading or stretching the fabric. I purchased the smaller box with 6 cleaning cloths, each enclosed in a water tight package. This works out to about $1.50 for one cleaning.Following instructions I placed my coat and one sheet in the drying for 20 minutes on medium heat.When I removed the coat while it was still warm per instructions. It was wrinkle free and I no longer could detect the smoke smell. It did smell a light fragrance scent from the Woolite sheets themselves. In about 7 days that Woolite scent was almost undetectable, and the smoke scent was still undetectable.Tips based on my experience and manufacture recommendations:1. TIME: The recommendation is treat the garment for 20 minutes. To achieve best results the garment should be soft and warm to the touch upon removal from the dryer. If the garment is hot and overly dry when your next load reduce the time by five minutes as your dryer maybe running hotter than average. On the other hand, if after 20 minutes the cleaning cloth is still damp increase the tumbling time by 5 minutes.2. STAINS: Cleaning solution is oil-based and works based in cleaning oil-based stains such as makeup, lipstick, mayonnaise and salad dressing. Test a small spot of your garment for colorfastness before spot cleaning. Woolite cleaning sheets may not work on set-in or difficult-to-clean stains, such as cuff soil. For those you will need a professional dry cleaner.If spot cleaning left a ring on your clothing there are two ways to remove it. The first option is to tumble the garment on high heat for 20 minutes. The second option is to use an iron to steam it out. To remove the ring with an iron you need to place the garment inside out on your ironing board. The spot should be facing down on a clean, light colored towel. Then you should lightly moisten area and set the iron temperature setting appropriate to the fabric. Iron the dampened spot with moist heat until dry. Rotate towel under the garment and repeat the process until the ring is gone.3. TEMPERATURE: Recommended setting is Medium or Perma Press. If the drying does not have those setting, High heat can be used but the tumbling time should be reduced. Cleaning cloth do not work on "air fluff" setting as it does not reach the temperature high enough to generate the vapors.4. VOLUME: Do not overfill your dryer; items must tumble freely.The local store where I purchased the Woolite had only one choice, but I noticed that Amazon carries scent free Woolite sheetsWoolite Dry Cleaner's Secret Fragrance Freeas well. I was pleased with how Woolite cleaning sheets worked but next time I will get the scent free option.Ali Julia review

I became a big fan of David Baldacci after listening to "Camel Club". Following a back surgery I need to walk as exercise, and a good audio book makes me want to do my exercises. This book did a splendid job at that - it made me want to keep walking and finding out the rest of the story. I like Baldacci's style of writing and the gripping story line."Split Second" is the first book in Maxwell and King series. Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are two disgraced Secret Service Agents whose presidential candidates both were killed/kidnapped. Through an elaborately connected events Maxwell and King team up to discover who is responsible for the conspiracy.This is the fifth Baldacci book that I listened to. I thoroughly enjoyed each one.

I recently had back surgery and have been looking for gadgets that will allow me to be more mobile and independent.This product is one of them.One of my main requirements was that I had to be able to install and remove it by myself, without assistance.Other options, such as straps that are hung on the open window require another person's help. However,I can handle installing and removing this handle without asking for help.How does it work? The most common way to use this handle is to insert into a door latch. It provides somethingyou can lean on when exiting/entering the car. I am short, so this handle is at a very good height for me.I suppose if you are very tall it might be a bit low. You can test it by imagining a handle at the level of thedoor latch. I think it would work in any other hole that might exist in the door frame, if you can find one at abetter height.Ali Julia review

This item was indispensable after back surgery. Initially when every step is very painful it was used right near the bed, eventually as I got better the bucket was removed and used over the toilet to help lower and raise over the toilet seat.The unit has a number of important features1. It is adjustable. Having the seat the right height for a short person like myself was very important for comfort.2. It is stable. When you are warbly yourself, it is very important that handles and legs are steady.3. It is fairly light. I had trouble lifting and moving the lightest items, yet the commode was something I could manage.

I purchased a nice folio/stand (Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 Leather Folio Case) for the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tabletSamsung Galaxy Tab 7.GSM Tablet. However I noticed that when I use it as the stand the nice soft inside covering of the folio comes into contact with whatever I put it on and picks up dirt that then is deposited on my beautiful screen. So I decided purchasing a nice little stand will be better, and picked this Arkon Folk-up stand based on outstanding reviews. I have to whole heatedly agree that this is a well designed product.I am attaching a collage of 6 photos which shows the stand from different angles with and without my tablet on it.The best feature of this stand is its versatility. It can fit a tablet of any size, in both vertical and horizontal orientation. One can also completely control the angle at which the screen is held.Photo #1,#2,#3,#4 show my tablet in horizontal and vertical orientation from the front and from the back. Photos #5 and #6 show the stand without the tablet.Dimensions:1. When totally folded the stand is 6 3/4 inches long, 1 inch wide, 3/4 inch thick.2. The notch on the bottom is 4.5 inches away from the pivot joint.3. The pivot on vertical part of the stand is 3 inches away from the bottom pivot. In the position I have chosen in the photo it is 2 4/3 of inches away from the horizontal support.4. The portion above the pivot on the vertical part is 3 inchesThe bottom of the legs and the piece that holds the tablet is covered with soft suede-like material for good traction. You can spread the bottom legs to a multitude of positions to fit tables of various sizes, and you can angle the top but to control the angle of the screen.My tablet is very stable on this stand. The stand itself folds up well and is easy to carry around. It is very easy to set up again, all joints move smoothly.I am very pleased with the stand and recommend it.Ali Julia review

I wanted to buy a heart-rate monitor so I don't go out of range of my target heart rate goal. I decided to go with a chest-strap model because it allows you to get the reading without touching the unit. The wrist-only models require you to touch the device to see the reading. My balance is still a little off after back surgery, so not having to worry about getting the reading is an important feature for me.This watch-style monitor has a watch, stopwatch, alarm, backlight and setable sones, and a zone alarm that beeps when you go out of the target zone. It also measure heart-rate recovery. This features measures how many beats your heart rate drops after the exercise.Over the last year the price on this monitor fluctuated between 52.46 and 35.38. I found a nice tool that helps me shop showing the Amazon price history. You can find it by search on those words and then selecting the tool with the word camel in its name. I find it very helpful.Overall, I am pleased with the monitor and have not encountered any issues using it.

This tape (or equivalent productShurtape FP-96 General Purpose Kraft Packaging Tape: 2 in. x 60 yds. (Kraft)) are very handy when you need to write on the package, I also use it to cover up old writing if I am re-using a previously used box to cover up old writing and still have it look decent.I was about ready to re-supply my supply of it on Amazon, when I saw that Staples had a better price.

I often use a colander when cooking pasta or vegetables. In the past I used a two piece strainer which had the bottom as a separate piece. Every few years the bottom would dislodge itself and I would need to replace the strainer. The last time it happened I decided to look for a new model and headed to a local kitchen store. I found Polder and I am very pleased with it. I paid $21 (more than Amazon by a significant percentage) but was able to eyeball it to make sure it fits my favorite pot, the Reverware 8 quart. I am attaching a collage of 4 photos (you can see them by following customer photos link under the main photo) to demonstrate how this strainer fits into the 8 quart pot.The Polder strainer has 9.5" diameter, it is 7.5" in height. The handle is 6" if I measure from the rim to the tallest point.The 8 quart pot is 9.5" in diameter, 7.25" in depth.Photo #1 and Photo #2 show the pot and the strainer next to each from different angles.Photo #3 shows the strainer inside the pot. You can see that its rim is just above the rim of the pot (this is 0.25 inch difference in height between the two).Photo #4 show the view from the top. You can see that feet of the strainer are resting on the bottom of the pot.It is nearly a perfect fit. I say nearly rather than perfect, because if you put a lid on top of the pot, it does not quite fit. It rests on top of the colander. In most cases this is ok.I really like the design of this colander:(1) One piece design means I will not have to worry about dislodged bottom piece as was the case with the previous model I was using(2) The silicone handle makes is comfortable to lift the strainer from the pot(3) The colander feels solid and well constructedI hope my review will help you determine if it is a good fit for your pot. If it is a good fit, I highly recommend it.Ali Julia review

I am not a very handy around the house person. I was trying to hang a bracket for a Wall-Mounted Organizer on a hollow wall and made the pilot hole too large, so the nail and anchor both came out as I was screwing it in, leaving behind a large hole. I had to ran out to get some spackling filling so I could proceed with the original job.This putting knife did an excellent job smoothing out spackling paste I used to fill the holes. It is just the right size. The handle is comfortable to hold. It is sturdy without being too heavy. This is a good quality tool.

I always have a bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide at home. It has so many uses! I use 50% solution of water and H.P. almost daily to clean my toothbrush. Sometimes I use the same solution to brush my teeth. It whitens the teeth well, although it does not taste great. However a little rinse with water fixes the after taste.I used to use Hydrogen Peroxide for scrapes as well. Recently I fell and got a pretty nasty gash on my shin (4 inch by 0.25 inch). Because I was traveling I did not treat the wound as well as I should and got an infection. In a few weeks when I had to see the doctor to treat the infection, I asked what I should have used to clean the wound to avoid the problem next time.Surprisingly, the doctor told me that Hydrogen Peroxide should not have been my first choice. The doctor said that H.P. does clean but also damages the healthy tissue and this prolongs healing. The doctor said that studies show that the best way to clean the wound is with plenty of plain water and soap and pressure on the wound to remove the debris. Hydrogen Peroxide should only be used if there is no access to clean water. So it should be in your emergency kit when you hike but not your first choice if there is access to soap and water.Hope this helps someone to avoid a slow healing infection.P.S. A note on price. My local grocery store sell 16 oz bottle for $1.50, I saw similar prices in a local pharmacy.Ali Julia review

This is the firt of Alison Holt books on machine embroidery that I bought, I was so pleased withwhat I learned in the book that I bought two others. This is a wonderful reference to a freehandmachine embroidery enthusiast. The results you get with free hand are more beautiful than anythingyou can get with an embroidery machine because of the irregularities that doing free hand embroidery brings,thus making scenary look more realistic.The book teaches you techniques in sewwing as well as how to create images not only by drawing freehandbut from tracing photographs. You don't need to be an artist to be able to look like one!In my artwork based on this book, I did not use silk, resist or dyes. I simplified the approach byusing hand-dyed fabric bought in the store, silk rayon and sulky poly cotton threads for their shinybeauty. So the book is great by giving you ideas on which you can build and create your own thing, withyour own tools. What is fantastic is the techniques itself, the whole approach in how to build the scene,what intensity of colors to use, what stiches work best, and so forth. This is one of my favoritebooks as it opened a whole new way to be creative, and I have done hand free landscape embroiderybefore I read the first book.The book is organized in the following way:1. Design. This chapter talks about composition, using phographs, and combining photographs to build your scene.2. Colour. This chapter talks abou mixing color, using color grid, preparing and using resist, painting backgrounds, and choosing thread. (As I mentioned earlir in my review, I used purchased hand-dyed fabric to simplify the process here)3. Starting to embroider. Setting up your machine, shading and blending, sitch tecniques, experimetning with different stitches. This is one of my favorite chapters, I picked up a lot of ideas here.4 Projects. Detailed instructions for 3 projects. Beautiful projects, clear instructions.

I have bad balance due to variety of back problems. Yaktrax give excellent traction in all icy conditions. They also add mental confidence, so I am less jittery in the icy conditions.They are pretty stretchy and fit on variety of my boots which vary in size by 1 size. They are sturdy, I have used them for several winters - no rusting, no breaking, still work as good as new. I recommend this product.

For the last couple of years I have been growing a couple of tomato plants on my patio in large pots. Until last year I waited to plant my tomatoes plants until the end of May as cold frosty night we get kill tomatos that are planted too early.Last year we decided to try pop-up green house to see if can extend the growing season in the cold North East. Small plants were planted in the green house in early April.My plants were watered by a drip irrigation system on a timer. I did not open the green house other than every two weeks to fertilize the plants. The plants grew rapidly and survived well through a number of frosty nights we had since early April. By the beginning of May my tomato plants had flower clusters.I was concerned about pollination, since my plants were covered and no well meaning bee could get to the flowers. After doing a bit of research I found that either insects, wind or hand shaking of the flowers would carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma. I found that some people use electric toothbrush placed near the blossoms to simulate buzzing bees. But I went with a simpler method: shaking the plant gently once a week for self-pollination. The tomato pollen is not in the exterior of the anthers like most flowers but is produced internally and then released thru pores in the anther. Motion is required to release the pollen, and the greatest quantity is released by sonication of the "correct" frequency. When you shake the plant by hand try to mimic the natural resonances of sonicating bee. Shaking should not be violent, just as close to the right frequency as possible. Note that using implement like a cue tip or a brush is not very effective because the tomato's pollen is not on the surface.In the last week of May last year I noticed the first tomatoes on my plants which is pretty incredible for the cold North East! I felt like a proud mother since I polinated the plants myself with a technique described above :-)Update 5/21: I live in the Northeast, close to New Hampshire/Massachusetts border. This morning I noticed my first green tomato! The tomato plants are about 3 feet tall and have several flower clusters. A friend of mine and I bought the same variety of tomatos on the same day, but he does not use a pop green house. I visited his house this weekend and his tomatos are still little dwarves compared to mine! This pop-up plant house really works!

I enjoy various crafts but have never tried quilling until I saw this book on a library shelf. It sounded interesting so I took it home and discovered a whole new world of paper quilling.Quilling is easy to learn and does not require a large investment in specialized tools. All you need is paper (I started with paper I use my ink jet printer) cut in thin strips, a big needle, and paper glue. Instead of a guilling tool I used a big needle with a big eye. To start quilling I inserted a strip of paper in the eye of the needle and began twirling. It takes just a bit of practice to get nice scrolls going and then the book gives you nice idea of shapes and projects to try. The author, Molly Smith Christensen, has been quilling for 25 years and she shared her experience, short cuts, and troubleshooting ideas with the readers.The book has 115 pages of explanations and 8 pages of patterns/templates. The author starts with simple projects and progresses to complicated ones, such as making letters and large pictures. It was a great book for a beginner, and I think a more experience quiller would find interesting projects in the second half of the book as well.Thanks to this book I found quilling to be fun and a hobby with quick rewards! Within the first half hour I had a beautiful greeting card ready to be mailed and admired.Ali Julia review

I purchased this cane after back surgery to help me walk up the stairs. If you need a cane for walking up the stairs it is very important to get the cane with a small base so all four legs will fit onto a step.The cane is very light and stable. It really helped shortly after the surgery.I was taught how to use this cane in a rehabilitation facility. The cane is unstable if you use it the wrong way. The four leg base is not symmetrical. One one side two legs are spaced a little close together, on the other side a little more wide apart. It is very important to have the wide part AWAY from the body. The base can be switched based on whether you want to use right handed or left handed.I saw that one of the reviewers mentioned that the cane is unstable, I am pretty sure it is because they did not use in the right orientation. It makes a huge difference.

Fabricmate is good set of fabric markers. The pen's tip create brush-like effect, which nice and different from other fabric pens. I use them in my art quilts and they produce very good results. The edges of the color are not sharp, it is less obvious that a fabric marker was used to enhance the color. The colors are nice, they do not run, and have no unpleasant odor when they are being used as some other permanent pens.I have gone through several sets of these pens, they last me about a year after which they dry out.

I purchased a paperback version of the "Learning to Weave" by Debbie Redding and Deborah Chandler. This is an economical way to buy this classic reference. The spine is a spiral so it is easy to keep the book opened to any page you want.The book is extremely detailed, from position of the hands when you dress the dress to numerous illustrations on various topics. I am attaching a photo of the page addressing the topic of warping the yarn. The amount of fine details and explanations is better than in any other book I read. I had high expectations based on everything I heard about this book and it totally lived up to my expectations.This book helped solve some beginner problems I had earlier. It made it easier and faster to dress the loom. And my weaving edges are looking better with floating selvedges, a technique I learned in this book! The chapter on troubleshooting and various options to fix mistakes is very helpful. This book also has a large section on various weaving patterns.I currently thinking about upgrading my first loom to a bigger one. I was pleased to find a chapter about buying the right loom for you. It has several useful considerations that I will keep in mind.I am sure I will be coming back to this book again and again. I join the chorus saying that this book extremely helpful if you are just learning to weave. It will curb your learning curve!Ali Julia Review

This book is a perfect match for my interests! As a fiber artists I love hand dyed yarns and fabrics, and I also enjoy gardening. This book is a perfect guide to combine my two interests.The author gives excellent instructions on what plants to plant (and not to plant because they are invasive), what plants give what colors (and which colors you cannot get out of plants, but can get out of other natural sources, such as insects). She provides instructions on both growing plants and dyeing using plants. Instructions are clear, the tone is friendly and easy to follow, the pictures are beautiful.The book contains the following chapters:1. Choosing which plants to grow2. Getting and growing dye plants3. Planning a dye garden4. The basics of dyeing with plants5. Colors and colors6. A portfolio of dye garden plants7. SuppliesI enjoyed this book from cover to cover and will be coming back to it again as a reference for my garden!Ali Julia Review

I recently bought Mother's wheel brushMothers Wheel & Wheel Well Long Handled Brushand after using it posted a review with before and after photos. The brush did a nice job, but left a couple of tough stains behind. I purchased Mothers foaming wheel cleaning to see if I can get those tough stains out.I covered the wheel with the foam, brushed with mother's wheel brush for about 2-3 minutes, and hosed off. Wow - no more stains! I was impressed. And, of course, it did an excellent job with the break dust. I have never seen my wheel that clean with just the car washing solution. I recently had back surgery, and still have discomfort when bending down. So it is very important for me to find products that work well without putting much strain on my back. I am very pleased!I am attaching before and after photos of the wheel, as well as a photo of the bottle next to a pen for relative size. I will post an update when the bottle is empty. It will be interesting to know exactly how many washes I get out of the bottle. I did not think I used much of the bottle content, the bottle still feels heavy.Note on price: I purchased this product on Amazon for under $8, as I am writing this review the price is $10. So the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.

I have tried other paper towels but always come back to Bounty!Bounty is very absorbent and strong. I can use it wet or dry, and it never lets me down.I prefer regular size rolls as they fit neatly into the paper holder holder andspin easily from the first sheet.I have a Bounty roll tucked away on every floor - basement, kitchen, bathrooms. Bounty gets used up quickly around my house, so this 30 pack roll is very helpful not to worry about running out.

The original Mr. Clean AutoDry Car Wash gave me 4 washes. I have to say that I dry the car with a micro-fiber cloth after using the system. I am pretty picky about the water spots and Mr. Clean did not quite do it as well as I can do with micro-fiber towel. It left a bit of spotting especially on the glass and chrome parts. And I enjoy drying the car with a towel, and lets me check for chips or any areas that might need claying.I do like the water gun and the delivery of the soapy water to the where I where I wash because my car is tall and I have to stand on little foot stool to wash the top of the car, this lets me stay up on the stool without running to the bucket with soapy water. So after the initial cartridge ran out I bought a refill.Warning: The water gun with the soapy refill is relatively heavy. Since I began having back problems, followed by back surgery I find it uncomfortably to use it due to weight. However, I hope when my back improves I will be able to use it again. If you have back problems keep the weight of the unit in mind when you deciding on the purchase.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert".

This is a beautiful resource book. The designs are great not only for stained glass but as quilting patents as well.The designs are presented as black and white outlines, which can be enlarged on the copy machine to the scale of your preference. In the book they appear one on the page, or two on a single page. Four pages (both sides of the front and back cover) are in color, the rest of the artwork is in black and white. The book contains no text or explanation, other than the publishes note as preface.The images include florals (majority), leaves (many), fish(1), geometric (many), butterlies(2), peacock (2), women (4).As mentioned earlier I used it to create appliqu&eacute; quilt designs and got a huge number of compliments as they look very striking in fabric. So this book has many uses and I certainly got my money worth in my art projects.

I purchased CyperPower battery Backup 685va at a local CostCo as the price there was better by a considerable amount.I am attaching a collage of 3 photos number 1 through 3 under customer photos, which I will be referencing in this review.This is a fairly small unit and I use it for my electronics other than the main computer: nettop that serves as my home-made DVR, a TV, and a sewing machine. The battery powered outlets are used for the nettop and for the TV. The sewing machine is on the surge protected outlet (not battery powered).I call this battery a fairly small unit based on how much run time it provides when it runs on battery. How long the unit can run on backup power depends on the device's usage of power. Here are battery backup runtime estimates for this 685va backup battery. Also, keep in mind that as the battery grows old you will get less run time from the fully charged battery.1. All-in-one-computer (i.e. a fairly weak computer with a screen) is estimated to use 50 watts an hour and will run 45 minutesI expect my nettop and TV to be somewhere in this category.2. Basic desktop with LCD screen is estimated to consume 100 watts and will run 20 minutes3. Powerful desktop (such as a gaming system or a development system where you do compiling and linking) is estimated to consume 200 watts and will run 5 minutes685va unit has 4 full-time battery powered outlets and 4 surge protected outlets (2 of which are spaced far away from each to accommodate 2 transformer sized plugs).The unit is surprising light and relatively small. Photo #2 shows the view from the top with a pen placed on top of the unit for size reference. The unit can be used flat or upright.CyberPower has a USB port (see photo #2) so it can commute with the computer to do a graceful shutdown before shutting down. The battery is compatible with Windows and Linux. I have not tried it with a Mac. I am running Linux on the nettop so I did not have to install any software, the support for this functionality is built into Linux. PowerPlanet software is provided for Windows and be downloaded from CPSwww com web site.CyberPower also has a cable to connect to a phone, FAX, or other network equipment.If you are wondering why the sewing machine is protected, let me share my expensive lesson with you. Two years ago I was painfully reminded that a modern sewing machine is a computer and its main board can be fried by a power surge. After a power glitch my sewing machine stopped working. When I took it to a repair shop they told me that the main board in the sewing machine was fried and needed replacement. To replace the mother board my sewing machine had to be sent back to the factory, and not only was it expensive I also lost the use of my sewing machine for over a month. My sewing machine was plugged into surge protected power strip but it did not protect it. The surge protector of the battery backup provides more protection that the power strip so when my sewing machine came back from repairs it was immediately placed on a power backup just like the rest of my computers.Photo #3 contains a schematic for battery.1. Battery and Surge protected outlets2. Surge protected outlets3. Power switch4. Power on indicator5. Electrical wiring fault indicator (e.g. bad ground) if this light is on, you need to disconnect the unit6. Communication ports (fax, phone, etc)7. Circuit breaker (can be used to reset after overload)8. USB port to PC9. Widely spaced outlets that can be used for recharges and other wide plugsThis battery backup replaced an older unit: it is lighter, smaller in size, has more features, and fairly inexpensive. If used for devices that don't consume a lot of watts it provides a reasonable amount of backup power. I am quite pleased with it so far.Ali Julia review

I was attracted to the trowel because I recently had back surgery and bending down is a bit problematic for me. The telescopic trowel allows me to continue gardening even with a bad back! The trowel telescopes smoothly, feels light, and has a nice non-slip handle. I am sure it will work great for some with a good back too, but for someone with a bad back it is a way to enjoy an old hobby without feeling any physical limitations!This is by second gardening product made by Bond. After purchasing a telescoping rake made by BondBond LH013 Fan Rake With Telescopic Handle & Non-Slip Grip, I was on the lookout for other gardening tools from the same company as I was pleased with the quality of my rake. Bond products feel sturdy yet light. I had the rake for over a year and it has not rusted, bent, despite the good amount of use.I am very pleased with my new trowel and would recommend it. Note that Amazon has a much better price than I paid in a local nursery.Ali Julia review

I have not been able to wash my tub for close to 9 months because of a herniated disk and subsequent back surgery, so my tub was a perfect subject to test the ability of Mr. Clean MagicReach.The mop was easy to assemble out of three parts. The height of the mop was perfect, allowing scrubbing the tub without much bending. The cleaning mitt is covered with fine fibers forming a gentle scrubbing surface. This material is not as scrubby as a real brush. [see attached photos]The mop did a fine job removing light stains but not the soap scum accumulated during the long period of neglect. I scrubbed vigorously for 5 minutes, then let it stand for 10 minutes, then scrubbed again for 5 minutes. Washed off with hot water, and repeated the process one more time. The dirt was lighter, but not totally gone.I also have to mention that the cleaning chemical had a very strong odor, it slightly burned my eyes and skin on my hands (without gloves). I am normally not sensitive to cleaners or chemicals.Overall, I am pleased with the height of the mop, and the way the cleaning head adjusts to the shape of the tub. The package contained only 4 mitts (2 tub mitts and 2 floor mitts). The mop did a reasonable job cleaning, although it did not totally meet the challenge I presented it with.I am posting a series of photos of the mop as well as tub before and after the cleaning.Ali Julia review

After back surgery it was difficult for me to get up and down the toilet seat. However the riser seat was not the right solution for me.The riser seat is not comfortable for short people. It provided some minor aid in getting up and sitting down, but doing your business when your feet don't touch the ground turned out pretty difficult.When I sat closer to the front, so I could touch the ground the seat shifted as I did not distribute the weight equally. It did not feel safe, it was too warbly.I found that the seat that fits over the toiletMedline 4-in-1 Steel Commodemuch more comfortable and the handles provided additional aid. I felt very secure even when I had problems with my balance.

These warming footies is a good idea, but one-size-fits all is not a good execution of it because they don't stay on my (small) feet.In the winter my feet get so cold that I have trouble falling asleep. I purchased these footies to wear them at night when I sleep but the booties slip off my 7.5 sized feet while I sleep. Putting them back on requires enough effort to really wake me up.However, I am came up with a solution that really works much better for me. I found stretchy socks into which I inserted my own home-made microwavable inserts. Since a few other reviewers mentioned the same issue I am going to describe how I made my home-made booties. Here is the description of how I made them.I measured the length and width of my foot and created two strips which were 1 inch larger than my measurement in every direction. I cut strips out of strong dense cotton fabric. I put the right side fabrics together (the side I wanted to be on the outside) and I stitched 1/4 inch around them 3 times leaving only 1 inch opening on one of the narrow sides. Then I turned the fabric inside out, stitched around it one more time, still leaving 1 inch opening. Then I filled the bag with grain (I used barley, but round rice will also work well) and then stitched the opening closed by sewing it several times for strength. I did not over-stuff the bag, the grain can move easily and conform to my foot.Before I got to bed I put these bags into a microwave for 1.5-2 minutes, and stuff into the stretchy socks, which I then put on my feet on top of terry socks I normally wear to bed. Perfect! Warm and comfortable, the bags stay on my feet all night. Even when they stop being warm, they provide extra insulation and my feet has been toasty all night.This solution cost the under a buck for fabric and barley/rice. I have been using the same bags for over 1 year, and they are still working perfectly every time. I hope this home-made option will help someone else!Ali Julia review

I like these brown rice bowls. The rice is delicious and brown rice is good for you. I prefer brown rice to white rice because it is a whole grain, with brown bran layer intact, so it has fiber and antioxidants not found in white rice. These bowls contain plain brown rice (no herbs or flavoring), so you can do whatever you want with it. It cooks very quickly so I like taking it with me to work as lunch side dish.This rice take 90 seconds to prepare. By comparison regular brown rice takes 40 to 50 minutes to cook. Regular price costs about 17 cents per once, and Gogo rice bowls in this 12-pack package cost 23 cents per ounce. This seems like a pretty fair price for convenience of speedy cooking, with the taste being practically as good as slow cooking rice to my taste buds.If there is a problem with this product and for some reason can not get satisfaction from Amazon, you can search for the company on the internet, they will replace the product directly.Overall, I like the taste and convenience of these brown rice bowl and recommend them.Ali Julia review

A couple of months ago I purchased the 11" OXO turntable. I am so pleased with it that I purchased this bigger 16" version. I put this turntable on top of my refrigerator, which used to be just a dead space. Because I am short not only I could not reach anything but I could not even see anything that would be placed on top of the refrigerator other than things on the very edge. With the turn table everything is on the edge and I can reach everything very easily.The construction of the turntable feels well made and solid. It rotates smoothly. The top surface is non slippery.The outer dimensions of the turn table are 16", the inner dimensions of the turntable where you place your content is 14". The base and the black border are about 1 inch wide on each side, so they account for the 2" difference. The base is wider than the rotating part, so you can put the turntable directly against the wall or other items and rotate the turntable without catching on anything that is next to it.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that might help get the general idea of the capacity of the turn table. It is quite roomy and rotates well despite being loaded with cans.I am very pleased with being able to get additional space that was previously inaccessible.Ali Julia review

Last fall I had a serious back surgery, so my house is full of reachers (currently numbering 6 total) to help me do various chores. This reacher is one of the most used. It has easiest to squeeze mechanism and I use it to pick up laundry out of the washing machine one item at a time without any pain in my hand.This reacher does a great job on items that are larger (like my laundry). However, its gripping mechanism does not work well for small things like a small piece of paper, a needle that fell on the floor, or other tiny things. For those jobs the Unger reacher is betterUnger 92134 36-Inch Nifty Nabber Pick-Up Tool with Aluminum Handle, as its picking mechanism is second to none. Picking up small sewing needles from the floor is easy in one take. But Unger's squeezing mechanism requires a bit more force so it is harder on your hand, and I can't do laundry with it - the muscles in my hand start to hurt.Bottom line: Duro-med reacher is very good for the jobs that don't require picking up very small objects.Ali Julia review

Oxo Good grips grader has multiple grating surface, soft grip handle that is comfortable to hold, optional container storage container, and nonslip base. It provides a great combination of stability when grading with grading options. It is a little slimmer than my previous grater box so it is easier to store.My favorite uses for the grater are cheese and apples. I prefer another grater as an orange/lemon zester, because it is easier to clean. I find it to be sturdy and comfortable to use.I like the storage container, it fits into the grader perfectly and reduces the amount of spillage when you are grading. The storage container does not have a lid, so if you want to store something in it you would use a saran wrap as cover. However, I try to use up everything that is freshly graded and rarely use it as storage, but I like it as catch basin.When I use the grater without the container, I like the nonslip base as it really helps with stability.Overall, a handy tool to have in my kitchen and I recommend it.Ali Julia review

A few years ago we had to undergo Chlorination treatment after we detected contamination of the water supply. I could not stand the taste of the Chlorinated water and decided to try if Pur filter is going to remove that unpleasant taste. It absolutely did! Since then even though we no longer need chlorination I continued to use the Pur Filters.After about 2 years the unit that attaches to the faucet cracked and I had to replace it. I have very hard water so I think it is not unreasonable to replace the holder every a couple of years.Each filter has a little light, which turns red when Pur recommends you replace it, but I found that the better indicator is either the taste. I can usually get an extra month or so from each filter after the red light indicator comes on. After that the flow of water decreases to the point of being annoying. However,I found that if I slightly unscrew the filter (without removing) and then screw it back on, it resets internal mechanism which shuts of the flow of water and I can get more use of each filter. I can tell when the filter is spent by taste. I think both the light and the decreased flow are a gimmicks to increase the rate at which you buy new filters.Overall I am very pleased with the Pur Filter system. It solved my problem with the bad taste, it easy to put on and replace filters, and it is a reasonably priced solution

This is a good beginner book. It does not assume a knowledge of techniques needed and starts with fairly detailed general instructions.I bought this book a gift to a non-quilting girlfriend, whose mother passed away and she wanted to make a quilt out of the dresses that her mother owned as a memory quilt. When I saw this book I thought it would be exactly what she needed.Simple book, with ideas of how to use small pieces of fabric not bought as yardage. My friend took almost a year to make her memory quilt and now is a treasured family keepsake. My friend told me that she would not have been able to undertake the project without this book.This book has instructions for making 46 patchwork quilts. In addition to general technique description, it also includes 32 full size templates. It contains both color and black and white photos to illustrate the instructions.The book has section on:* Equipment* Quick cuts from strips* Quilt as you go* Selecting and preparing fabrics* Making string material* Assembling strings on a base

I love this fan! I had this fan for a few years. I bought it for its small size and cloth blade so I can take it with me when I travel as I have trouble sleeping when it is too hot.Recently I had to have a surgery and took with fan with me to the hospital. The hospital rooms rooms tend to be very warm and this fan kept me comfortable. Not only did it keep me cool and comfortable, it also was very forgiving when someone accidentally got too close to it. Sticking your hand into the blades does not hurt a bit. If this was a fan with plastic blades I might have had trouble having it next to me in the tight quarters of the hospital.The fan has two settings - high and low. I found it generated a very pleasant breeze on a low setting. One other plus - it makes absolutely no noise.I can't be more happy with this fan.

I found this thermometer to be just ok. This pop-up thermometer calibrated to pop at 180 degrees which is past ideal cooking temperature for turkey. Food continues to cook for a few minutes after it is removed from the oven, so overall result was that bird was a bit overcooked.I found that using a meat thermometer to check for doneness works better. I stick it into the innermost part of the thigh. A turkey needs to reach an internal temperature of 165F in the thigh meat before it can be considered done, at 180F I find the meat to be a bit overcooked and dry. When I just started cooking I used a common rule of 20 minutes per pound uses the over temperature of 325F. Through experimentation I found that I prefer to cook at a higher 475F to get crisper skin and a moister bird.Ali Julia review

Benzoin tincture of benzoin is typically used as a treatment for damaged skin. It is often applied before applying tape or other adhesive bandages, especially if you have to keep taping and re-taping the same area. I use it slightly differently. I have a friend who is an avid skier and applies Benzoid Tincture to avoid blisters from skiing boots. When I told him about a corn I have on top of one of my toes which is irritated by otherwise very comfortable shoes, he suggested I start using a bit of Benzoid Tuncture on top of my toe. Since Benzoid tincture is often used as an antiseptic (due it the benzoin as well as its alcohol solvent) I felt safe using it on a corn that was irritated. I found that the compound really helps. Now my corn feels less irritated and less painful.I am attaching a photo that shows an open container of the benzoin tincture (photo can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo). The content is a dark brown thick liquid that hardens a bit as it dries. A small hole in the cap allows you to dispense a small amounts. The liquid does stain if you spill it as I found out the first time I applied it to my toe. Now I put something under my foot as I apply the compound.Overall, using it on my toe every day made me more comfortable and I recommend it.Ali Julia review

The most important thing I want to mention is that the Amazon description contains a mistake.It states that product dimensions: 8.8 x 0.5 x 4 inches, in fact these hooks are 6.5" long.The description specifies no weight limit, the packaging of the hooks states a limit of 20 pounds.I am attaching a collage of 2 photos (which can be located under customer photos link under the main photo). The first photo shows these hooks next to a ruler. The length of these hooks is 6.5 inches.I am also including a photo of the back of the page where you can see the weight limit of these hooks is 20 pounds.These bike hooks are smaller and lighter than other bike hooks I own. They were not what I was looking for even though I found a way to use them because I hang so many different items from hooks to keep things organized. I like the vinyl coating, and the price for 4 hooks is very good... but the description is wrong on size, and it specifies no weight limit. Thus the total rating of "OK" 3 stars.Ali Julia review

I had a herniated disk in my lower back and now recently had back surgery. I am always looking for solutions to daily chores that are easy on my back. This brush is better than a brush with a short handle but it has a number of short comingOn the positive side1) Increases your reach2) The triangular shape is good for reaching into various corners3) It does allow me to bend lessOn the negative side1) The handle is a bit short even with extension. I have to stand on my knees in order to give me a comfortable cleaning angle.2) Extension does not hold well, and shortens if you push hard.3) In order to do a good cleaning, you really have to push hard4) It takes many hours for the brush to dry and stop dripping. After the cleaning I have to leave it in the tub for a day, so I clean right after the shower time to have a long stretch when the shower does not need to be used.So I have not found my ultimate shower tub scrubber yet.

I have very hard water. I have tried a large number of toilet cleaners trying to remove the sediment/rust ring. I tried Clorox, CLR, Vinegar, Various Toilet bowl cleaner. Nothing worked. I was embarrassed whenever company came over. When I heard about the pumice stick I was somewhat skeptical, but figured I would give it a try. It took less than 10 minutes to completely remove all the nastiness completely. You just have to see it to believe it. Two split image photos attached: the toilet before and after, and the stick before and after.The pumice stick not only removed the sediment, it was fast and easy to use. As pumice works it crumbles and this grit helps clean the sediment. After the job was finished I felt the bowl with my finger I did not feel any scratch marks.Pumice stones come as a stick without a handle or as a stone attached to a handle. The pumice stick without a handle gives you better leverage, and is cheaper. To avoid small particles coming off the pumice stone getting on my hands I just put on gloves.A-m-a-z-i-n-g!Ali Julia review

Ken Follett is one of my favorite writers, and this book does not disappoint. I was enthralled in the story from the first page. The story line involves a conflict between Israelis and Arabs in 1968, and is full of turns and twists that will keep you on the edge of your chair. This is a highly entertaining book and I recommend it.Ali Julia review

Olfa pinking rotary cutter is a nice tool to use. It is an easy way to cut a pinking edge.I use this rotary cutter in several ways. One is to create a pinked edge which does not unravel, and another one to create an interesting edge in my art quilts. I also use it to cut paper for decorative uses. I did not notice any significant dulling of the blade from this use.Olfa pinking rotary cutter is a lot easier to use thank pinking scissors. The scissors really require you to put some muscle into the cutting and hurt your hand.The rotary cover comes with an easy to put and remove safety cover.The rotary cutter makes cutting a breeze!

I am on my second shredder. I did not use shredder oil on the first one, and after about 1 year use it froze. I was not able to get it going again. When I bought a replacement shredder I began applying shredder oil every month and I can really tell the difference. The shredder is three years old now and operates as well as new. The motor sounds even it chews through the papers very well.The bottle is easy to open and a long extension nozzle is helpful for precise place-ment of the drops. Each application requires only a small amount of oil. I would say I put a total of 8 drops in the opening, and then move the blades in both directions. This takes a total of many 20 seconds.I read that once this oil runs out it can be replaced by vegetable oil and I will try that, however this is not going to happen any time soon as I use very little during each application, so this bottle is going to last a very long time.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.

I like flaxseed somewhat nutty taste. I have added seeds to be part of my diet, I found them to be a helpful way to add more vitamin and fiber at relatively low cost of calories. Flaxseeds have a concentrated dose of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and essential fatty acids. Flax flax has more omega-ss and phytoestrogens called lignans than any other food.Flaxseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the seeds into the container.My favorite way to eat flaxseed is in a smoothie. I blend 1 Tbsp. ground flaxseed, 1 cup juice (I vary which juice I use for variety), 1 banana, 1 Tbsp. avocado, and ice.In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.FLAXSEEDSNutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.HEMP SEEDSSimilar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.BUCKWHEAT GROATSSoft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.WHEAT GERMThe flaky center of wheat kernels. Very light earthy flavor.Ali Julia review

Through the years I have bought several of these radios as a gift for my mother. She loves listening to the radio and prefers to listen to it (rather than TV) as she does her chores around the house. The first radio broke after a fall on a tile floor after several years of daily use. After it broke, my mother told me to get exactly the same radio as she really liked it (and she had many others before this one).She loves it because1) Great reception no matter where she is in the house: bathroom, kitchen, yard, and so forth2) She mostly listens to AM radio, and not all radios give you good AM reception, this one does3) It is very light, so it is easy to carry around4) Takes 4 AAA batteries when the outlet is not handy (runs a long time on rechargeables) - great when cords are in the way or when there is a power outageI love this radio because she loves it, and I also love that such a good radio comes at such a reasonable price.

This is a great little scale. It very accurate (I checked what it measured with the post office scale on several occasions). It is small, so it fits anywhere. I have been using for several years on the original set of batteries with almost daily use.I like that it can give read out from letters which are under 1 oz to up to packages that are 55 pounds. It can handle large packages, and you can remove the digital read out if your package is too large for you to see the read out when the package is placed on the scale.This scale saved me a lot of time standing in line in the post office. It saved me a lot of money driving to the post office. It covers all my needs. I am a big fan of this little scale.After many years of service my first scale stopped working. It began generating random numbers non-stop. The behavior matched the situation when the scale needs to be recalibrated. I could not correct my scale and bought a new UltraShip scale. But since it took me a while to find the calibration instructions so I am posting them here in case it will be of help to someone else.How to calibrate**The UL-30/35 requires a 10kg calibration weight to calibrate. The UL-50/55 and UL-75 require a 20kg calibration weight. (you can use a combination of weights such as 5 2kg weights)**1. The scale must be powered OFF. Press and hold [ZERO] first, then Press [ON/OFF] while keeping the [ZERO] button depressed, then release both keys. The display will show the A/D value (a series of random numbers).2.Wait for the stable A/D value to be displayed, Press [UNIT] the display will show "0SAVE", then the display will return to the random A/D value.3.Place the 10kg (UL-30) or 20kg (UL-50 & UL-75) weight(s) on platform. Wait for the stable A/D value to display, then press [UNIT], the display will show "0SAVE". Calibration is complete, remove the weight(s).4.Turn the scale OFF (Press the ON/OFF key) , then turn it back ON and check some weight readings. If calibration is still incorrect, repeat calibration but try it more slowly.If calibration is repeatedly incorrect then:1) Replace the batteries,2) Try a more stable surface or vibration and interference free location,3) Be sure there is no staticelectricity on the scale (use an anti-static spray to remove static electricity)Some useful weights info:1 liter = 1kg and 1 gallon = 128oz.= 8 pounds, 1/2 gallon = 64oz = 4 pounds

Kyocera Ceramic Peeler is a peeler with a comfortable ergonomic handle, sharp ceramic blade which can be adjusted into different positional (left, right and horizontal position). I like this peeler as it replaces two old peelers. I use it not only for potatoes, but for slicing very thin apple slices for tarts, slicing fruit for fruit salads, making cheese slices for a salad. I keep the blade in horizontal position for potatoes, and on an angle for fruits.I LIKE:1. Ceramic blade is very sharp and does not rust.2. The handle is comfortable to hold3. The left and right adjustment is handy not only for natural right and left-handers, but when you get tired you can switch hand while peeling.4. 5 year warranty - Kyocera will replace broken parts5. Now comes in two colors (original red or new black) to match different kitchen decors better. The other colorKyocera CP-20 BK Perfect Peeler, BlackI DON'T LIKE:1. It would have been nice if it had a pointy end on the handle for digging out potato eyesThis peeler allows me to do the slicing with minimal amount of effort due to the sharpness of the blade. I recommend it!Ali Julia review

I really like using a pump delivery system for my toothpaste. The main reason is that it generates a lot less mess on the bathroom counter. It delivers just the right amount of toothpaste, does not splatter, there is no overflowing tube and cap that leave little bit of toothpaste on the counter. This means less clean-up!The triple protection AquaFresh is one of my favorite flavors of toothpaste. I like its taste during the brushing and after using it my mouth feels clean because of the minty after flavor. It is not too minty and not too sweet.Even though most of the cleaning is achieved by the mechanical action of the toothbrush and not by the toothpaste, the toothpaste provides lubrication and good taste to make cleaning more pleasant. This makes people brush longer and that is very important. Aquafresh does a very good job.The price on Amazon is good but fluctuates. I find it helpful to look up historical prices in a Amazon price history tool. It allows you to see the prices for the last year and even to generate alert emails when the Amazon price reaches the desired level. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.

I ordered to the utensil holder to hold my regular spoons, forks, knives (not the large kitchen utensils). This caddy works well for this purpose because it has three separate sections, with one section being shorter. So I am able to separate spoons, forks, and knives into separate compartments which makes it easier to get the right utensil when you need it.The caddy is pretty larger (larger than I expected) 9" length x 4" width x 7" depth(height). The two tall compartments are 7" deep, the shorter compartment in the center is 5" deep. The short compartment in the front is 4.5" wide.I am attaching a photo which shows my utensils in the caddy. You can see how different size utensils fit into it. I also added some tall utensils (ladles) which I normally don't keep in it, but figured it might be useful for someone who plans to use it that way.I like:1) Three compartments2) Has shallow compartment that is good for small spoons3) Stylish looking4) The bottom is trip is plastic, which means the metal does not touch the counter. This translates into no rust on the bottom which what happened with my previous caddy.5) Sturdy and bottom heavy, the utensils inside have no chance of toppling it over6) Has a removable spoon rest which slides off the front of the caddyI did not like:1) For my use I would have preferred the tall compartments to be an inch shorter.Overall it is a nice, sturdy and attractive looking holder. I recommend it.

I give my 4 year old car a full cleaning treatment at least twice a year. About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way. That's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job, it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below:WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing, as it removes the grime better. I use microfiber towels to wash. What you use to wash makes a big difference, a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong. Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions. Hot paint finish is also easier to damage. So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it. I wash the top of the car, then the bottom of the car. I don't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash. I use more micro fiber towels. I like Costco's micro fiber towel bag, for $10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas. I don't clay the entire car, just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel, spread it on a small portion of the car (3 feet by 3 feet), then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel. If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off, that's why working on small areas is better. If I drop a towel, I move on to the next one. Even tiny dirt particles you can't see will scratch the paint surface. I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts. If I do get it on the plastic parts, see "back to black" described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car. It makes the plastic look new, and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces. Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts, it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour. I love riding in a shiny clean car plus I always get great value back when I sell my cars.Meguiar's Gold Wax is one of my "secret" weapons to make a four year old car look like new. I recommend it!Ali Julia review

This is one of the first fabric landscape books I have purchased. It was clearly written, has beautiful photographs, and was a true inspiration for me. I have learned a lot from this book, and created several projects based on the ideas in the books.The book is well organized, and I have returned to it a number of times for some additional inspiration and ideas after the initial reading. This is always a sign that the book is very good!Chapter 1. Getting started. This chapter talks about general techniques such as useful tools, adding borders, cutting, glueing, design walls, etc.Chapter 2. Creating your own landscape quilt. This chapter has step by step instructions of creating the book cover quilt "Black eyed susan" and two others. The basic techniques in these chapters are a great foundation on doing your own designs.Chapter 3. Adding Garden accessories. This chapter talks about adding other elements to your art work, such as picket fences.Chapter 4. Cutting free-form shapes. This chapter concentrates on cutting and design, includes a number of beautiful examples.Chapter 5. Creating woodland scenes. This chapter covers doing tree landscapes. Trully beautiful, one of my favorite chapters for inspiration.Chapter 6. Creating Water, Sky, Mountains, and Snow. The title of the chapter is very descriptive, it teaches techniques, gives ideas, and has many examples.Chapter 7. Finishing touches. This chapter talks about embellishments, such as machine embroidery, ribbon embroidery, three dimensional appliqu&eacute;, and so forth.I highly recommend this book. It teaches and it inspires.

This is one of the best chargers I have used. I own it now for a couple of years, and went through a number of batteries being charged in it. The main reason I chose this re-charger is because it has a slot for 9-V battery, and it recharges my 9-V batteries very well.This re-charger is pretty bulky (see attached photo next to a pen for a size reference.) In the photo you can see how the batteries of different size are arranged during the charging cycle.In the photo you see 9V and AA batteries in their slots. The empty slots are for AAA batteries. 9V battery slot is perpendicular to the other slots. It goes over AAA slots, so when you are charging 9V battery the room for charging AAA batteries is reduced (you can still fit two AAA while charging 9V).What I like:1. Has a slot for 9V batteries, there is not a lot of 9V chargers out there especially with good ratings. I have several re-chargable 9V batteries and can vouch that this function works well2. Fits a large number of batteries (8 batteries)3. Has a trickle charge to refresh batteries, so I keep batteries in it in case of a power outage and I know they will be good and readyWhat I don't like1. Has only one 9V slot, I wish there were twoNote that "Rayovac Rechargeable NiMH Battery, 9-Volt Size, 1-Count Package (Pack of 3)" I bought at the same time was a bad deal. One of the three batteries in the pack was a total dud, I could not get it to charge at all.

I needed to connect a timer to a drip irrigation system and a hose connected to a sprinkler to the same spigot. Gilmour Brass 2 Way connector does a perfect job without any leaks.I needed to use Vise Grips to loosen the valves for the first time, but after that they operated easily and smoothly. The splitter was easy to install. I used plumber's teflon tape connecting the splitter to the spigot and to hose on one connector and timer on the other. The valves operate smoothly and do not require a lot of strength to open/close, and none of the junctions leak.The Gilmour Brass 2-way connector stock photo makes it looks a bit larger than it is in real life. I am attaching a photo of the connector after it was installed so you can see it in context.Photo posted: installed Gilmour connector.

My tomato garden is on my patio so space is at a premium. To expand my gardening space last year I added a Topsy Turvy planter. I grew cherry tomatos in it, because they tend to stay more compact and produce a lot of small sweet tomatos.The main down fall of tomatos growing in the topsy turvy planter can be the lack of water because the dirt dries out much quicker than the dirt around tomatoes planted in the ground. To solve this problem I used a drip irrigation system on a timer which released a small amount of water into the plant several times a day. This kept my tomatos very happy and healthy. A drip irrigation system may sound expensive but you can buy a kit for around $20 dollarsRain Bird Patio Watering Kit PATIO-KIT. Since everything in containers gets dry fast, I have my entire patio garden watered by a drip irrigation system. After buying a small drip irrigation set up 3 years ago, it has been functioning great each summer and all my vegetables, strawberries, and herbs have been much more productive.

Gold Bond is my favorite lotion. My worst area is dry cracked heels and Gold Bond Healing Skin Therapy totally takes care of the problem - no more painful heels! I also use it on my shins, elbows, and hands. I have tried quite a number of lotions and this is the one that works best for me. I can really feel the difference.As I got older I really began depending on the lotion to make my skin feel better and not itch. It takes twice as long for older adults to regenerate skin when compared to younger adults. In addition some common medications such as cholesterol lowering drugs remove lipids from the skin which adds to the problem. Women going through menopause have decreased amounts of estrogen which also causes the skin to be dryer.I put on lotion right after a bath or shower, then the lotion locks in moisture. If you apply it to try skin you are oiling the skin which can be helpful but not as effective as applying it after the shower.I also like Gold Bond because it has no strong fragrance. Its odor is barely perceptible when you apply it and is not perceptible once it is on the skin.I like:1. It works well on problem skin2. It does not have a strong odor3. It feels nice4. It gets absorbed quicklyI don't like:1. Hard to get all of it with the pump once you get to the very end.I use a long chopstick with a bit of cotton on the end once I get to the very end.Ali Julia review

I use this quilt rack in somewhat unconventional way. I use it as a beautiful towel rack in my bathroom. I like my towel to have a lot of room to dry. I am quilter and originally bought this rack for my quilts but then adapted this quilt rack to be a towel drying rack in the bathroom.It is much more attractive than any towel rack I have seen and looks beautiful in my bathroom. It is low profile (narrow in width) and does not take up a lot of room. It provides a lot of room for drying. Its finish stood up well to the damp towels and have not discolor after over 6 months of use.Ali Julia review

I have dry eyes that require me to put drops in several times a day. At its worse my eyes were so dry that I had trouble opening my eyelids in the morning, they were stuck to my eyes. I have tried a large number of eye drops, which helped me with various degrees.My favorite eye drop is Refresh Tears Lubricant Eye drops in a bottle. It does not irritate my eyes, it provides a long lasting effect, it does not blur my vision when it is applied. It works equally well during the day and night. I buy smaller bottle for travel, and use the 1 oz larger bottles at home/work. Both small and large containers are great - they dispense the same perfect drop size every time. Whether the container is full or nearly empty the drops come out easily and always the same size. I only can guess that the container is empty by weight or when I get nothing but air bubbles :-)Refresh Tears Drops for Sensitive eyes single use vials work very well. They have no preservatives and are better for sensitive eyes, however they are more expensive the Refresh Tears in a bottle. Each vial has 4 drops. So I feel I am wasting the money if I use it just once. It is possible to re-close the vial for a second use the same day, but only if you can place the container somewhere it will not be disturbed, since the closure is pretty loose. I use these when my eyes are particular sensitive.Refresh Liquigel blurs my vision, and when I wake up my eyes a covered with crusty residue of the gell. I don't like it. The packaging of Liquigel looks very similar to Lubricant drops, and at least on one occasion I bought the Liquigel by mistake after I already knew it did not work well for me. I hope this warning helps someone to avoid the same mistake.Systane lubricant drops irritate my eyes, they become hot and itchy and the eyes need almost constant lubrication. I don't understand why this happens, I don't have any allergies. I have tried this lubricant several times, because my doctor likes it and offers me samples at every visit.GenTeal Librican Oitment blurs my vision after application, so I can only use it at night. When I wake up my eyes are crusty with the residue of the lubrication.Genteal Lubricant Gen Aqua does not irritate my eyes, but the effect of the drop seem not to last. I need to reapply these drops much more frequently than Refresh Tears.Murine Lubricant Drops do not irritate my eyes, but the effect of the drop seem not to last. I need to reapply these drops much more frequently than Refresh Tears.Visine drops are very inexpensive and work well in my eyes, but my eye doctor told me not to use any lubricant that has `get the red out' in the name. He said it has extra medication to constrict blood vessels in the eye, and he said such drops should not be used for every day use.On my last visit, my doctor suggested that I try taking 2 triple omega oil pills a day, as he found it really helps eye dryness. I was sceptical, but figured I would give it a try since fish oil has other positive effects. 2 weeks later I really began feeling a difference, my eyelids are no longer stuck to my eyes in the morning. I still use eye drops, it just does not feel as urgent when I wake up.Ali Julia review

I love lemon marmalade. They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely. I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment. First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz). Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.List of ingredients:Sugar 62g per 100gGlucose-fructose syrupLemonsGelling Agent: Pectin, Citric AcidAcidity Regulator:Sodium CitrateFlavoring: Lemon OilColor:Caramel E150CPrice with shipping slightly over $11.I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea. I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce. I am so disappointed!8/22/11 UpdateNormally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email. I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund. So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try.

I get blisters on my pinky toes when I walk more than 30 minutes. I tried various remedies which did not work until I found Glide. Even orthopaedic shoes did not fully cure the issue. But Glide did. I put a bit between my toes, smooth it out with a finger, and I can hike for hours without any ill effects. Glide does not feel greasy or slippery, it just works. My skin feels softer too. My blister covered sad pinkie toes, now look smooth and pretty like a baby toes! I have been using Glide every day for over a year, still works, no ill side-effects of any kind.

Kotex Lightday Pantiliners are the best quality pantie liner out there. I have tried several other brands only to come back to Kotex. It sticks well, yet easy to remove. It does not bunch up. It has good absorbency.This product has a light scent. After trying both scented and unscented, I prefer the unscented version (Kotex Lightdays Pantiliners, Long, Unscented, Jumbo Pack, Case of Six-105 Count (630 Pantiliners)). The unscented Kotex pantiliner packaging come in slightly longer size and they are a penny more per pantiliner (6 cents per pantiliner).The packaging in this product is the best deal value - 5 cents per liner. You get 768 pantie liners but they don't go bad so they will just last for a long time :-)Bottom line: this is the best value and the best quality.

I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product, I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose, and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist, 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work. I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor. My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.

The water we get on tap at work has a strange after-taste so I have been bringing bottled water with me to drink at work. I like Evian water taste (it feels 'fresh' to me) and often select it as the water I bring to work. I was not totally sure about the difference between different types of bottled water and wondered if it was just marketing. Recently I came across a good explanation of different bottled water terms and I wanted to share the summary of the definitions here.Spring water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface. Spring water must be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. Evian and Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water.Artesian water is obtained from a well that taps a confined aquifer, an underground layer of rock or sand that contains water. Fiji Natural Artesian Water is one example of artesian water source.Distilled water is water that has been boiled and then recondensed from the steam that the boiling produces. The process of distillation kills microbes and removes minerals, however it tends to give it a flat taste. Glaceau Smartwater is distilled water.Mineral water is ground water that naturally contains a minimum of 250 parts per million of dissolved solids. "Naturally" means that the mineral were not added later, it means all minerals must be present in the water when it emerges at the source. Calistoga is one example of mineral water.P.W.S. stands for Public water source (also often called municipal water supply or tap water). Aquafina is an example of water that came from a public supply.Purified water from any source that has been treated to remove chemicals and pathogens according to standards set by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia. It must contain no more than 10 parts per million of dissolved solids. Distillation, de-ionization, and reverse osmosis are all purification methods. Aquafina and Dasani are examples of purified water.Sparkling water contains carbon dioxide at an amount equal to what it contained when it emerged from its source. Note that carbon dioxide lost during the treatment process may be added back. Perrier is an example of sparkling water.The terms "glacier water" and "mountain water" have no standard definition and thus it is not known exactly what is the original source of the water for the waters that use these terms to describe their product.Ali Julia review

I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking. Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well! Porcini's are one of my favorite mushrooms, and JR Mushrooms brand have an excellent quality. AB rating means they have caps and stems, and AA rating will give you get more caps. Stems are slightly more chewer, but I like the flavor of both caps and stems.To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the water boiling. Then let them cool. If some of them are still hard I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft. Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.They are easy to use in many different ways. They taste great sauteed in butter. I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken. I also found they go great with any Indian sauce, like Pataks:Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 OzMushrooms, what do they taste like:* PORCINI - sweet, nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut* OYSTER - mild, slightly nutty* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms, but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos* ENOKI - very delicate flavor, slightly crunchy if fried* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor* SHIITAKES - rich, almost beefy flavorJR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price. I recommend them!Ali Julia review

Canon paper works very effectively in my Canon printer. It gives me superior results compared to other photo papers I have tried in my printer. The area that particularly shines is the skin tones. They come through in realistic tones. I also observed no fading in color, even in the photo displayed in the room (vs the one stored in albums) over several years I have used the paper.

I like using 4 compartment mesh bags when I do laundry. They keep pesky bra straps to themselves rather than getting tangles and snagging other delicate items. They are also handy for keeping socks together! They protect all sort of delicate undergarments well. I recently purchased two more of these mesh bags made by different manufactures to compare. I compared Whitmor 6154-988 (the one in this listing) and Honey-Can-Do LBG-01146 Hosiery Wash Bag.Turns out there is a difference that makes me like this Whitmor mesh bag better. I am attaching a collage of 4 photos number 1 through 4 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.Photo #1 shows that the bags are about the same length 17.5" Blue label is the Whitmor wash bag, and the white/orange label is the Honey-can-do wash bag. Honey-can-do bag is 7 inches wide, Whitmor bag is 7.5 " wide. Honey-can-do bag is 7 inch deep, Whitmor is 8 inches deep.Photo #2, #3 and #3, #4 show the construction of the pockets. This is where the major difference between the two bags exists. The Whitmor bag dividers end 6/8 of an inch from the top, Honey-can-do dividers end 2 1/4 inches from the top. Why is this significant? Because during the laundry content of one compartment migrates to another compartment in Honey-can-do bags much more than it does in Whitmor bags because their dividers leave large gaps at the top.The Whitmor bag is made out of softer nylon mesh, Honey-can-do bag is made out of stiffer nylon mesh. This makes no difference in washing, but the soft bag is slightly more pleasant to touch.Overall, I like Whitmor mesh bags better because they keep the content in each compartment through the entire laundry much more consistently.Ali Julia review

My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters. These toe separators did not work for me. I have given myself a chance to get used to them and suffered with them for 2 weeks wearing them every day. They slipped out from between my toes. They were not comfortable in my shoes. I have small feet and I felt them all the time. And they irritated the skin between the toes while they were in place. I threw them out.I found a better solution that works for me. I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formula - .45 ozto put between my toes. They now glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don't have any blisters.

This little book packs a lot of information and great patterns into its 18 pages of material. It is probably the best information per page value you can get!It contains full size pattern blocks for 20 lovely Hawaiian designs, a bit of information and history on each page, as well as traditional outline quilting suggestions for your final work. The front cover has images of completed blocks, the front inside page gives you general instructions on folding fabric, how much material you will need. The back cover gives you tips for finishing and using multi-color designs.I have made every block in this book and they are beautiful! I also purchased another book Hawaiian Quilting by Elizabeth Root because I liked this one so much. I have made full size quilts, wall hangings, as well some jackets with Hawaiian designs on the back. They all got rave reviews!I can't believe such wonderful book costs so little! This is one purchase you will not regret making!

Enchanted views is one of my favorite quilting books. My copy is quite worn out I use it so much! The author combines stunning photos of her works along with wonderful patents for the iron works which the reader can use in their own projects. The author's technique is to combine water color quits with beautiful black iron work fences. I used the iron work fences in combination with other techniques as well. This book was an inspiration for a large number of projects which brought me rave reviews!Chapter 1. Ironworks as decorative element. The author shows how she draws inspiration from real ironwork and how she adapts those designs to fabric.Chapter 2. Sewing essentials. A chapter for beginners to help them to have everything they need on hand.Chapter 3. Beginner's Workshop in Reverse Applique. A good guide in this technique. This technique is used for the ironworks.Chapter 4a. The projects. 6 beautiful projects with patterns and explanations. Projects include grills, grids.Chapter 4b. Gallery of student quiltsChapter 4c. 7 more beautiful projects with patterns and explanation. Projects include stained glass, fanlights, leaded glass.Chapter 5. The garden gate wallhaning project. This chapter contains a stunning gallery of garden quilts with various fences.This book is a "keeper"! I found myself coming back to it again and again. Sometimes just to flip through pages for inspiration, sometimes to get a pattern of a fence to include in the project. Every time I look through the pages it lifts my spirit and sparks the desire to create.

I bought Sandsik 4G MicroSDHC card for LG 800G. The card worked well in the phone. I also tested the card and the SD adapter in my PC and the adapter worked well as well.The card and adapter came in bulk packaging as mentioned in title of the listing, this means in came in the plastic case enclosed in a plastic zip lock baggy. No blister pack.Overall, I am pleased with the memory card: good price and it works.Inserting memory into LG 800G had a couple tricky spots, so for other LG 800G owners I am including steps for inserting the SD Memory card into the phone.1. SD memory card slot is located under the battery. This means that you first need to remove the cover by sliding it down. The first time I had to remove the cover it was a bit difficult, as the cover is very slippery and has no groves to hang on to. I finally was able to do it by using the grippy material used to open cans. The grippy material generated enough friction that the cover finally slid off. After removing the cover, you need to remove the battery.2. The memory card slot is on the left side of the white SIM card. The gold bars on the card should face down towards the gold bars on the phone. The memory card goes under a metal holder. You need to lift the metal holder, place the memory card, and then lower the card holder, and push it down until it snaps in place. Note that lifting the holder for the first time requires some force. I used a tiny screwdriver to give me leverage to push it up. I am attaching a photo (which can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo) which shows the holder in the up position, so you can see what you need to do to insert the memory card.3. After the memory card is in place, you need to replace the battery and the phone cover, and power up the phone.4. Now, you need to set your default memory to external, and tell the camera, the video recorder, and the voice recorder to use the external memory rather than the internal memory like before.5. To set the default memory:- Tap the following sequence MENU - Settings - Phone - Memory Info - Primary storage settings- Tap on External memory (red check will appear)- There will be a FORMAT button at the bottom of the screen, tap on it- The phone will ask for a security code, enter 0000. Once you enter the security code, OK button will appear on the bottom of the screen. Click ok. Format takes about 1 second.6. To set the camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizontal position, as you turn you will see camera control setting appear on the screen.- Tap the gear icon which is on the lower left side of the screen.- The memory setting is on the second screen of camera settings, so you need to tap the slider on the right hand side (it will say 1/3, first page out of three) once you tap it will change to 2/3.- On the top row you will see a square called 'select storage'. By default it will look like a cell phone, once you tap it will look like a memory card.- Hit OK to save your change7. To change the video camera:- Tap Camera icon on the main screen holding the phone vertically, turn the phone to horizon position, as you turn the camera controls will appear- Tap the gear looking icon on the bottom left- Now you need to switch from camera to video, which is done by sliding your finger from camera to video camera icon on the right hand side slider- If you do it correctly, you will see a red button appear where the video camera is. If you do it incorrectly, you will take a photo. It took me a few tries to get the pressure and location of where my finger slides correctly.- The storage setting is on the second page of the video camera, so you need to page down on the slider by tapping on 1/2.- Tap on 'Select storage' icon, and make sure you see a memory card, rather than the cell phone icon.- Click OK to save your change8. To change the voice recorder- Voice recorder is on the second page of Settings. To get there select Menu - slide you finger right to left to page - tap on Voice recorder.- The top option is 'Storage', tap on it to change cell phone icon to memory card icon.- Click ok to save your changeAli Julia review

I am not a very handy around the house person. Making holes in the wall occasionally resulted in extra holes, crumbling plaster, spackling and starting over. Then I discovered OOK system! It is easy to use, good results on plaster walls, and I have not had to redo it once!The nails are sharp, they go in easy, and it is not possible to put them in crooked. This is a nice assortment to always have on hand! I highly recommend them. If I can use them with easy - anyone can!

I bought this product based on the best per-tube price. I wish I have tried just one stick first.I did not like:1. Flavor. I don't like the minty flavor, and tingling feeling after the application after applying it.I don't like mint flavor in general, so this probably a significant contributor to the reason why I did not like this product.2. It does not have a lot of staying power compared to Chapstick I used before I bought this product. So it requires frequent re-application.3. Hardness. The lip barn is hard, I have used it for 1 week now and the edges of the stick are still hard and did not get rounded. With Chapstick after a couple of uses the end of the tube becomes nicely round and feels good on your lips.4. Packaging. The lip balm comes in a white tube which has a label glued to it. The wrapper was attached so poorly that it came off the first time I opened it. I now have a totally white stick with no label.For those who don't like mint flavor I don't recommend this product.Ali Julia review

I bought Clean&Clear; Persa-Gel treat adult acne when I get an occasional break out, and find it to work well. This gel is white and leaves a bit of residue on the skin. I usually apply it at night. However if I notice a zit starting in the morning I dab a bit of it on my face on the way to work and then I need to remember to remove it after I get there. Also be careful not to get it on any clothing, as it will behave as a bleach and leave spots. I also let it dry out before going to bed not to leave marks on the pillow case.This is a strong prescription (10% benzoyl peroxide) and is very effective, but you need to gradually increase its use (per instructions) to avoid peeling skin.Ali Julia review

I bought Eclipse optic cleaning system 2 year ago. Amazon has a much better price than I paid at a photo show.The solution was quite good at cleaning the camera lenses. Because the bottle is rather large I used this solution for cleaning the camera lenses at home, and took a smaller bottle of another solution when I travel with my camera. I have not used this solution since last summer, and this weekend when I decided to clean all my lenses at home was surprised by finding the bottle empty. The cap was closed tightly, the bottle was stored upright in the draw so it would not leak. The solution evaporated.I liked1) The solution did a nice job cleaning dirty lensesI did not like1) The bottle is large and it is not very convenient for taking on trips2) The solution does not last a long time due to evaporation. Plan to use it within 1 year from purchaseI am disappointed that the solution evaporated rather quickly. The smaller cheaper bottle I take with me when traveling has lasted much longer. So based on this experience use generously and don't try to make stretch for longer period of time.Ali Julia review

After a treatment with antibiotics my doctor recommended taking Acidophilus capsules to repopulate my body with with the natural Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria which is killed by antibiotics along with the bad guys.Lactobacillus acidophilus helps maintain an acidic environment in the body, which can prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Some women get vaginal yeast infections and unitary infections after a treatment with antibiotics because Lactobacillus acidophilus are not there to do their normal job. Taking a Lactobacillus acidophilus supplement helps the body maintain normal consistency of bacteria in the internals.In addition to the supplements I also increase my eat yogurt and kefir. For those who don't like yogurt fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi contain acidophilus.I am not taking these tables on regular basis. Per doc's recommendations I started taking this supplements immediately after completing the antibiotic course. I will take them until the bottle is empty by then I should be back to "normal".Ali Julia review

I love lighthouses and lucky enough to live in New England. We take a number of trips up and down the New England coast on "lighthouse trips" with the goal to see every lighthouse on the East Coast. This book has been very helpful in our trips. It has good direction, interesting narrative, and beautiful photography. It made it easy to navigate just to the right spot to view the lighthouse from the best vantage point.
