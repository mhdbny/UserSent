A couple of weeks ago I came across the US debut album 5:55 by Charlotte Gainsbourg at my local library. I read that she had worked with the guys in Air and Jarvis Cocker so I thought I would check the cd out. I have to admit that the album is a bit too mellow for my liking. It is definitely not something I want to listen to at the office but it is perfect to listen to at home. The dreamy ambient pop and Charlotte's whispery vocals. In lieu of the recent success of Feist and Yael Naim, I am surprised that Charlotte hasn't received a bit more attention since her vocals are awfully similiar to Feist and Yael's. All three women almost are just talking through out their music. However I am bored with Feist and Yael. What I like about 5:55 is Air's contributions. You can definitely hear the Air influences in the music with the deliciate melodies. It would have been nice if Charlotte would have ditched the dreamy pop sound for a bit and rocked out more, or if the beats took a more upbeat dance sound. The album does tend to be a bit too mellow but overall I do like what I heard.

Up until now I have never heard of Gabriela Montero. I recently discovered her this weekend when I was rummaging through the cd bins at my library and came across her BAROQUE ALBUM. Curiousity got me and I took the cd home with me. I have to admit I thought I was going to hear some operatic singing but much to my surprise (and delight), what I got was 52 minutes of sumptuous piano music that was a mix of classical and improvisational jazz. I definitely could hear the improvisational skills of Gabriela tinkling the ivory keys while staying true to the songs' intricate melodies. I think Gabriela does an excellent job in interpretating these timeless baroque songs with her style of pieno playing. My only minor gripe is that her version of "Canon" was a tad too quiet. I had to turn up the volume of my stereo to really hear the grand beauty of the song. I kinda felt the same way about "Adagio" however the song was not as subtle in volume. Despite this minor flaw, I felt the album is still worthy enough for five stars. I found the music to be very relaxing to listen to. I definitely will be checking out Gabriela's other albums.

"Play" was my first introduction to Moby. I remember when I lived in Milwaukee in 1999, I had lived with three other people. One of my roommates had bought the original version of "Play" (which the version of the hit "South Side" did not have Gwen Stefani on vocals). My roommate would have "Play" on his stereo non-stop. It did not take me very long to fall in love with the album. I eventually acquired my own copy of "Play". Personally I think this is Moby's best album I have heard. After picking up few more of his cds, I noticed that "Play" picked up where "Everything is Wrong" left off with the gospel-infused techno sound. The majority of "Play" is good but there were a couple of misses. I hate saying this but Gwen Stefani has an annoying voice. I find her voice quite shrill. She totally ruins "South Side". I much prefer the original version which did not include her on the track. I was not really too keen on "Find My Baby" or "Bodyrock". Personally I absolutely loved the gospel infused "Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad?". It is a gorgeous ballad. Techno music rarely sounds emotional but in this particular case, the heartache in the gospel sample shines through. As overplayed as "Porcelain" was on various soundtracks and chill out compilations, I still love the beautiful melodies. The techno tracks are easily the best tracks on the cd while the more guitar orientated tracks were not as good. Nevertheless, I still consider "Play" a classic album in the electronic genre.

I am not what you consider a huge fan of Nelly Furtado's music. I find her nasally vocals often annoying. I did not care much for her first album "Whoa Nelly!" but I absolutely loved the underperforming "Folklore". When I heard Nelly's first single off her latest album "Loose" called "Promiscuous", I automatically fell in love with the addictive pop hooks and hip hop beats. I am not remotely into hip hop music but I dug "Promiscuous". I was a bit hesitant to buy the new Nelly cd. Thankfully I found her new album at my local library. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the cd. There were a couple of songs that didn't strike me as anything special but for the most part the album is quite enjoyable. My two favorite songs on the album are the acoustic ballads "All Good Things (Come to an End)" and "In God's Hands". I found those songs quite pretty. They suonded like they could have been on "Folklore". I also dug "Maneater" which had a good hook and beat. I wasn't too big on "Showtime". I just didn't like the melody to the song. I don't know if it was really necessary to have two versions of "Te Busque". I prefer the spanish version. All in all "Loose" is a good album, perfect summertime music to jam to on my ipod.

A couple of years ago one of my favorite songs on the radio was Snow Patrol's "Run". The song was addictively melodic. I could not get that song out of my head. Last year they did it again with the single "Chasing Cars". I finally got around to checking out their latest album EYES OPEN. I can't deny that the band has talent in writing catchy pop/rock songs however they have yet to demonstrate that they are capable of diversifying their bland, dull, and predictable pop/rock sound. The cd starts off pretty good but halfway through the cd, the quality of the songs goes south for me. Ballads like "The Finish Line" are pretty weak. I find the vocals on this particular track quite grating on my nerves. I did like the song with Martha Wainwright on vocals. That was a lovely song. Overall Snow Patrol reminds me why I find "alternative" music so wimpy and annoying. Let me just say Snow Patrol is NOT indie rock. It's kinda hard to be considered indie rock when you are on a major recording label.

It has been nearly a decade since a former roommate of mine converted me into a diehard Delerium fan. One of my college roommates lent me his copy of KARMA and that is what got me hooked. After that introduction, I began what would become a steady relationship with the electronica act. Of all the Delerium cds I have heard over the years, POEM is easily my personal favorite. The music has the right balance of pop and ambient music with a dash of classical. I am not a fan of Leigh Nash for most of the time but I definitely enjoyed her contribution to POEM (as well as other Delerium albums). Her distinctive vocals gives "Innocente" a haunting quality to the song. I often get the chills when I listen to the song. Another wondeful song is "Aria" which features the classical vocal group Mediaeval Baebes. The womens' vocals are enchanting as always for this fan of MB. I personally enjoyed Matthew Sweet's vocals on "Daylight". It was different but overtime I have grown to love that song. I do think the song might have sounded better if it was at the beginning or end of the cd. Having it placed in between songs sung by women was a bit disjointing. My personal favorite song on the entire album is "A Poem for Byzantium" sung by Joanna Stevens (formerly of Solar Twins). The hooks, the lyrics, and Joanna's polished vocals was a killer combination. It is a beautiful song that I can never tire of listening to. I should also note Joanna also sings on "Myth", another lovely number. The only song I am truly tired of is "Silence". It was already on KARMA so I don't know why it was added here on POEM. Either way, the song has worn out its welcome with me over the years. Asides from "Silence", the entire album is joy to listen for me even after eight years since its release.

Back in the mid to late 1990s, I was listening to house and trance music. My favorite band was the British group Faithless. Their first two albums Reverence and Sunday 8pm set my standards and expectations for electronic music at the time. After a lengthy break away from the group (due to changing taste in music), I have come back to Faithless when I found a pristine used copy of Sunday 8pm at my favorite record store. I bought it without hesitation. I am so glad that I did. The blend of classical, trip hop, house, and trance music has not aged one bit. The album sounds fresh as the day I bought my first copy of Sunday 8pm. The songs flow effortlessly together whether it is an instrumental or a laid back trip hop track. "God is a Dj" still gives me the chills to this very day with its epic melodies and dance beats. Normally I don't dig remix cds but the second disc which consists of remixes is pretty darn good. The djs did a great job of maintaining the song's integrity. Sunday 8pm has proven to me that not all dance music is forgettable and disposable music.

Client is one of those acts that I have been wanting to check out but I kept putting them aside for other artists/bands. A month ago I finally got around to buying one of the duo's albums. I found the group's second album CITY at a local record store and bought it on a whim. I didn't realize until now that Sarah Blackwood used to be in Dubstar, a group I used to listen to in the '90s. I found myself enjoying Sarah's work with Client more so than her stuff with Dubstar. I would describe Client's music as one part Ladytron, one part Goldfrapp(post-Felt Mountain), and one part Depeche Mode. The music has a bit of rock, synthpop, and electro clash. I must confess that I didn't take to CITY right away. I had to listen to the album a few times to let the music sink in. The first three tracks kinda bored me but after that the songs got better, especially "One Day at a Time". Another great song I enjoyed is "Cracked", a lovely yet brief instrumental track. "Pornography" is another favorite with its catchy pop hooks and silly lyrics. Although CITY isn't a perfect album I still thought it was a good starting point for this new fan.

I am vaguely familiar with the musical stylings of Sia. I have heard some of her collaborations with the downtempo duo Zero 7. She was the only good thing that I liked about Zero 7 whose music I find rather dreary and uninspiring. I recently came across Sia's 2006 re-release of her album COLOUR THE SMALL ONE. I thought I would check it out. I have to say that I definitely like her solo work than any fo the stuff she has done with Zero 7. Her music is a pleasant mix of pop, folk, and trip hop music, perfect music to listen to while enjoying a cup of coffee while reading the morning paper. The only flaw with her music is that it sounds pretty much the same like her stuff with Zero 7. Still I find her solo music more pleasant to listen to. I really like the delicate melodies and her fragile vocals on songs like "Re-write" and "Breathe Me". The one song I really wasn't too fond of is "Sweet Potato" because of the melody (or lack thereof) and Sia's voice which sounds out of tune. The remixes were alright but I could have lived without them all the same. For all its minor flaws, COLOUR THE SMALL ONE is a very good chillout cd, much better than any Zero 7 cd IMO.

Ever since "Unsolved Mysteries" aired the story about the mysterious death of Elizabeth Short, I have always been intrigued by the story of the black dahlia. I was literally chomping at the bits when I heard that there was a film based around the mystery coming to the big screen. Despite the mixed reviews, I was excited to see the film. Now that I have seen it. I can understand why reviews have been terrible. This film is terrible. The story of Elizabeth Short took a backseat to the stupid plotlines revolving around Madeline (Hilary Swank), Bucky (Josh Hartnett), Lee (Aaron Eckhart), and Kay (Scarlett Johanssen). This film was build up to be about the mysterious death of Elizabeth Short but what do I get? One dumb, implausible story after another. The ending was worse with the ridiculousness performance from Fiona Shaw as Madeline's mother Ramona. The only good things I can honestly say about this film is the music (gotta love KD Lang) and Mia Kirshner, other than that, this film was a big artistic flop with me.

I have been a big fan of Dido's music since the first time I heard her lush vocals on Faithless' first album. Her first cd "No Angel" was good, a bit predictable and often bland but still quite good. Dido definitely has a distinct voice that sets her apart from most of her counterparts nowadays. She may have a limited range but she knows it and doesn't try to hit the high notes like a lot of singers do."Life For Rent" is Dido's second album. I definitely felt the material was much stronger than the songs on her first album both lyrically and musically. Her songs take on a more lush, intimate sound courtesy of the occasional acoustic guitar. I feel like I am in a studio watching Dido perform when I listen to "Life for Rent". The title track is my favorite song because I often relate to her lyrics. Initially I wasn't too wild about the first single "White Flag" but after hearing it several times on the radio when it first came out, the song eventually grew on me. The songs on the album tends to sound eerily similiar which is a minor flaw but I didn't mind it. I am just glad that there was no "Thank You" pt 2 on the cd. Overall this is a nice cd to listen to in the morning with a steaming hot cup of coffee and a scone or two, nice mellow music to chill out to.

I became a big fan of Evanescence four years ago when "Fallen" broke out in the mainstream. I loved the combination of Amy Lee's vocals and the meaty guitar riffs and thunderous rhythm section. After the loss of Ben Moody, the health of the band's guitarist, and a lawsuit or two here and there, the band finally re-emerges from its 2-3 yearslumber with "The Open Door". I had been eagerly anticipating the band's new album "The Open Door", maybe not so much lately since my taste in music over the years become much darker than Evanescence's music (gimme Blutengel and Cinderella Effect over Evanescence any day). Now that I finally have "The Open Door", I have to admit that I was disappointed in what I heard. The more I have listened to "The Open Door", the less impressed I am with the album. I find most of the songs devoid of melody. The guitar riffs are nothing to write home about. They are your standard rock riffs that you hear in most, if not all mainstream rock bands. The songs sounded all too much alike. I couldn'tell one song from the other with my eyes closed. I also find the lyrics contrived. Amy Lee comes off sounding whiney on all of the songs. She needs to get over herself big time. There were not many gems to be heard on the album. while it lacks the emotional impact of the ballads off "Fallen" like "My Immortal" and "Hello", "Lithium" is a pretty decent ballad but it would have sounded better as a simple piano ballad. The over dramatic melodies were nothing more but over dramatic. I also liked the first single of the album "Call Me When You're Sober". Maybe it is my constantly evolving taste in music but whatever the case may be, "The Open Door" was a lackluster follow up to "Fallen" to me, Lacuna Coil put out a vastly superior album earlier this year. The band knows how to diversify their gothic metal sound without alienating their hardcore fans. Evanescence might want to take their cue from Lacuna Coil, Leaves' Eyes, and most gothic metal bands who does this sort of music 100 times better. If "The Open Door" is what to expect from Evanescence in the future, thanks but no thanks.

Loreena McKennitt is one of a handful of artists from my youth I still listen to on a regular basis. I find her music so comforting to listen to after a long day at work. After a decade long hiatus, Loreena recently returned to the music scene late last year with AN ANCIENT MUSE and a US tour. NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA is Loreena's latest release which contains a bonus dvd of her PBS performance. The live cd is two cds of old and new material. I remember seeing her PBS performance and soaking in every song she sang. It is obvious that she was having a lot of fun during her show especially on songs like "The Mummer's Dance" and "Santiago". Judging by her little dancing with her accordion, it is obvious that Loreena was happy to be back on stage in front of a live audience. I loved listening to Loreena tell the audience stories behind the songs. I rarely buy live albums but NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA is definitely worth owning. There is not one song on both cds and dvd I did not like. Loreena could sing the phone book and still make it sound enchanting. NIGHTS FROM THE ALHAMBRA w/dvd is a definite must have for Loreena fans who have either seen or missed out on her US tour. Loreena was smart to package the live concert with both cds and the dvd. This is truly worth shelling out money for.

Imagine if the Backstreet Boys had actual singing talent and looked more like men than boys, they would probably look and sound like Il Divo. Yes Il Divo's music is ripe for parody given how cheesy it is with their overdramatized vocals and cheesy pop lyrics but I have to admit these guys can sing. I wasn't going to buy another Il Divo cd but when I saw a used copy of "Siempre" at my favorite cd store. I decided what the heck. I have to admit that I enjoy "Ancora" a lot so I thought I'd check out their more recent offering "Siempre". I must say that this cd did absolutely nothing for me. Half of the songs were bland and boring. I felt like I was listening to Josh Groban all over again on "Caruso" and that is not a good thing because the men do not offer anything different to this song that I haven't heard before. I did like the group's cover of The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin (Notte Di Luce)" and "Una Noche" but otherwise there is nothing spectacular about this cd that hasn't been done before by Josh Groban. Ya know it would be nice if the men were more subtle when it comes to singing like they were on this track than the loud, bombastic, foghorns they have a tendency to sound on most of the album. Gee another Mariah Carey cover? If "Heroe" wasn't cheesetastic enough, "Without You" will send your insulin levels to straight to the moon. I really wish Il Divo would find songs that were so insipidly drippy like "Without You" and "Heroe". Better yet I wish they would write their own material for once. I saw Simon Cowell on 60 Minutes this past weekend, it was obvious that he created this group just to make money. This band is nothing more than a manufactured boy pop group that just happens to sing opera music.

I wish televison whether the mainstream or basic cable wasn't so bland and boring. The (major) tv/cable networks need to liven things up a bit. I find shows like "The L Word" much more interesting than what that aging dinosaur called "ER". Unfortunately I don't have the money to afford the premium cable shows so I have to wait for "The L Word" to come out on dvd. I loved the first season. It was so refreshing from the bland and boring garbage on regular tv/cable.I just finished watching season two of "The L Word". Despite that misfire of a theme song which I think is absolutely hideous, I enjoyed season two as much as the first season. However season two isn't without its flaws. I did not enjoy the plot with Shane and Jenny's new roommate Mark. Another flaw...too much Toxic Tonya. Hideously annoying character. I did though love the tumultuous storyline between Tina and Bette. I wish though Tina was a bit more assertive. Carmen and Shane were absolutely hot. Tons of chemistry there. I also dug the character development in Jenny who actually did not annoy the heck out of me through out season two.I am so looking forward to seeing season three on dvd. I hope there will be some decent bonus footage unlike on the first two seasons.

Although I have never been impressed with Rob Thomas as a singer/songwriter with or without Matchbox Twenty, I was awfully curious to hear Rob Thomas's first solo album SOMETHING TO BE (mainly because of the single "Ever the Same"). So I checked out SOMETHING TO BE from my library. I was surprised by how SOMETHING TO BE was so not like anything that Rob has done with his bandmates in Matchbox Twenty. On SOMETHING TO BE, the music is a hodgepodge of rock, latin, funk, and soul. I gotta give the man some credit for trying to branch out from the blandness of Matchbox Twenty. Some of the songs worked for me, and some didn't. I really did not like the opening song "This is How a Heart Breaks". Does not have much melody to the song. "Lonely No More" is a fairly decent song. It had a good enough pop hook to have it as the opening single for the album. I always loved "Ever the Same" and I still do. The lyrics and the melody compliments each other. I personally think this is Rob's best song he has ever written. I also loved the last two songs "Streetcorner Symphony" and "Now Comes the Night". The rest of the songs that I haven't mentioned (except for "When the Heartache Ends") are pretty forgettable. Rob Thomas does show a good deal of promise on this cd that I haven't seen with his band but those moments of hope were far and few between. SOMETHING TO BE isn't bad but nothing remarkable.

I've been a VNV Nation fan for about five years now. What has always made VNV so unique from its peers is their emotional lyrics. The first time I heard the beautifully haunting ballad "Beloved", the first thing that stood out for me was the lyrics. Ronan Harris's lyrics moved me emotionally that most music I listen to is unable to do. As an avid fan of VNV Nation, I personally loved "Futureperfect" and "Matter + Form" but those albums weren't perfect in comparison to "Empires" which for me set the standards for futurepop.I was fortunate to receive my copy of "Judgement" earlier than most people will get it. It has been almost two weeks and I am still listening to "Judgement" non-stop. The album is immaculate. I am not really fond of most of VNV's instrumentals from the past especially on "Matter + Form" but here on "Judgement", the instrumentals "Prelude" and "As it Fends" are absolutely gorgeous with their lush, classical melodies. One of the songs that really stood out for me is the mid-tempo track "The Farthest Star". The song has a heavy synthpop flavor that I haven't heard since "Empires". "Testament" and "Nemesis" are soon to be classic dance tracks with their aggressive, stompy electro beats. My very favorite song on the cd has to be the haunting ballad "Illusion". Ronan Harris' lyrics on this particular track is as beautiful as "Beloved", "Standing", and "Saviour (Vox)". I find myself listening to this song the most on the album.Unlike "Matter + Form", "Judgement" isn't plagued by repetition. The music is more diverse. "Judgement" has quickly moved up to my top spot of my favorite cds of 2007 (so far). I hope that the band will play a lot of the new songs when I go see them in concert at the end of this month.

I must confess I went into seeing "The Lives of Others" with some apprehension. I didn't know much about it other than that spying was involved. Much to my surprise, I left the theatre glad that I had gone to see the Oscar winning film.The story of "The Lives of Others" takes place in 1984 in East Berlin, when both Germanys were still separated by the wall as well as politics. Ulrich Muhe plays Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, a member of the Stasi. He is hired to spy on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) for suspicious activities. In the beginning of the film Wiesler is portrayed as a cold, calculating, loyal member of the Stasi who does not question the authority of the Stasi or government. As the film progresses on, the more Wiesler observes his subject and his gorgeous girlfriend Christa-Maria Siedland (Martina Gedeck), I began to slight changes in Wiesler's demeanor. Life begins to appear in Wiesler's eyes after years of working as a member of the Stasi. These changes eventually effects Wiesler's assignment and he makes choices that drastically alters both his subject's and his own life.I was so impressed that this was the movie debut of director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The details Florian went into to portray life in East Germany prior to the wall coming down was so well thought out. Although the story is fictional, Florian did an amazing job at portraying life in communist East Germany as accurate as possible. For a film that was almost 2.5 hrs long, I thought time flew by for me. The performances were so well done. For me, Ulrich Muhe is the star of the film. Seeing his personality change ever so slightly through out the film was so compelling to watch. Seeing him change from being so cold to so vulnerable was quite heartbreaking especially his scenes with Martina Gedeck. Not many actresses today are able to convince me of their character's vulnerability and anguish but Martina Gedeck succeeds where most actresses fails for me. Her performance as Christa-Maria was tremendous with her subtle,nuanced skills as an actress.There honestly wasn't anything about "The Lives of Others" that I did not like. The writing was excellent. It did not insult the filmgoer's intelligence with bad diaogue and over the top action sequences. The filmmaker relied more on suspense and character development. Everyone's performances were wonderful. Now if only filmmakers from this country could do as good of a job as Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. They could learn a lot from this newcomer on how to make a film that doesn't insult the filmgoer's intelligence.

"For Your Consideration" is the latest film from Christopher Guest and friends who have given us so much pleasure with "Waiting For Guffman", "A Mighty Wind", and "Best in Show". "For Your Consideration" revolves around a cast of obscure and has been actors who are filming a movie called "Home for Purim". Now normally the concept of a movie within a movie is not a terribly good idea, example "Bewitched". In this case, the concept works.The cast of "Home for Purim" is Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara), Victor Van Miller (Harry Shearer), Callie Web (Parker Posey), and Brian Chubb (Christopher Moynihan). Marilyn Hack receives word that there is a rumor on the internet that she might be up for a best actress Oscar nomination. As a result of the rumor and word spreads around the set and in Hollywood, egos flare up and gets out of control."For Your Consideration" takes potshots at the Hollywood system from the actors themselves, film critics, entertainment tv tabloid shows, and the Academy Awards themselves. I found myself laughing out loud all through the film. My favorite performances came from Christopher Guest as Jay Berman, Jennifer Coolidge as the ditzy film producer Whitney Taylor Brown, Jane Lynch as a Mary Hart clone Cindy Martin, Rachel Harris as Mary Pat Hooligan, and Ricky Gervais as the head of Sunfish studios. I found Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey too over the top for me, especially towards the end of the film. The ending was predictable and rather lame but overall an enjoyable film.

"Curse of the Golden Flower" appears to be another "Hero" or "House of Flying Daggers" but in reality it is a Chinese soap opera. Ironically director Yimou Zhang is resposnbile for those two films as well as "Curse of the Golden Flower". His knack for vibrant colors and stunning martial arts is evident in his latest film.The story takes place in China during the Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun Fat plays Emperor Ping. He is married to Empress Phoenix (Gong Li). She has helped raised Ping's first song Prince Wan (Ye Liu who played Snow Wolf from "The Promise"), as well as bore him two sons Jai (Jay Chou) and Chen (Junjie Qin). It doesn't take long to discover the drama that is going on behind closed doors like Phoenix's relationship with her stepson Wan. Then there is the empress' failing health and the cause of her failing health. There are a few twists and turns in the story line but they were pretty much predictable especially when it involved Wan's biological mother and his secret love interest Chan. Nevertheless I enjoyed the story much more so than in "Hero" and it was less confusing than "House of Flying Daggers". I loved the vibrant colors in the costumes and scenery. They were absolutely gorgeous. "Curse of the Golden Flower" was a lot of fun to watch. It is a bit overdramatic and predictable but thoroughly engaging and fun to watch.

I had the immense pleasure of seeing the anime film "Paprika" this past weekend. The animation was visual eye candy with its vibrant colors and original designs. The storyline kept me riveted for all 90 minutes of the film. My favorite aspect of the film though has to be Susumu Hirasawa's film score. I was immediately taken with the music. The style of music is all over the place on this short 43 minute long cd. One minute the music has a catchy techno/pop beat and the next a loud, bombastic marching band sound. My favorite songs on the soundtrack is easily "Parade" (both versions), "Mediational Field", and "The Girl in Byakkoya" by White Tiger Field. This is my first time I have heard of Susumu Hirasawa's work and I must say I loved what I heard. His work is nothing I have ever heard before on any given soundtrack. It is so schizophrenic with its varied sounds yet it works. This is a great souvenir to own after seeing the film (which I absolutely loved).

I'm not really a big fan of the film "Whale Rider". I have tried watching it but the film never really appealed to me. What I did like was the film score by Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance fame. The DCD influence is obvious through out the album. The music is a haunting mix of ambient, classical, and world music. The songs are mostly instrumental but there is a bit of vocalization from Lisa (or so I think). The music is very relaxing to listen to. I feel like I am swimming underwater with the whales. There is nothing about this film score that I did not like. Lisa Gerrard did not disappoint me with this lovely album. Her work is always enchanting to listen to. This is how film scores should sound like...subtle and emotional.

I recently started collecting devil duckies. This yellow devil duckie is cute as cute can be. Watch out though, this critter isn't your average yellow rubber duckie. He has horns and is constantly up to no good. He may not be as tough as Tattooed Devil Duckie or eccentric as Pirate Devil Duckie but Yellow Devil Duckie is just as tough and cute as his cousins in the devil duckie family.

After hearing some of Light of Euphoria's music online for a year or so, I finally decided to check out one of their albums. I decided to get Krieg Gegen Die Maschinen because I just love the song "True Life". I have to admit I was hoping that the rest of the album would be in the vein of "True Life". It was not. The music starts off on a more synthpop sound then finishes off with a more aggrotech sound like on the last 2-3 tracks. I do though really love the song "Nothing At All" with its infectious pop hooks and bouncy dance beats. I do like the track "Consequence (Face Yourself)" featuring Ronan Harris of VNV Nation. I really wanted to like the rest of the album but to be honest, I couldn't. I found the remaining songs uninteresting and not so memorable.

A year or two ago I discovered Propaganda on the internet. I totally dug what little I heard especially since I grew up in the '80s and on new wave music. It wasn't until a few weeks ago did I finally get around to buying one of their cds, A SECRET WISH. Initially I didn't take to the music but over time, the more I listened to the album, the more I found myself enjoying it. The production is terrible but I can overlook that flaw. The overall sound of A SECRET WISH is a new wave fan's wet dream. To me, the band's brand of new wave music is reminiscent of Book of Love, early Depeche Mode, Yaz, and a heavy heaping of OMD. The music isn't nearly as catchy as say Depeche Mode but what makes Propaganda so interesting is how they constructed and layered their music. I really liked how the vocals were set up on the song "Jewel". There is this collision of noises crashing together and then the vocals were layered on top of the sampled sounds. I also enjoyed the hint of jazz in the opening track "Dream Within a Dream". That jazz influences was not something I expected. My favorite song on the entire album has to be "Strength to Dream". What a great way to end the cd. I wish I knew sooner about Propaganda given how big of a new wave fan I am but I am glad I know about them now.

Being a huge fan of gothic metal bands such as Elis, Midnattsol, Leaves' Eyes and of course Nightwish, I have always wanted to check out Within Temptation but their cds aren't available in the states at regular prices. Thankfully I received a copy of the band's most recent album "Silent Force" from a friend. I immediately took to the music right away. It definitely goes without saying that Sharon Den Adel has a gorgeous voice. I personally thought her delicate vocals were eerily reminiscent of both Sarah Brightman as well as Liv Kristine of Leaves' Eyes/formerly of Theatre of Tragedy. The music in general is an epic proportion of metal laced with sumptuous goth melodies which often veered off into opera territory at times. I loved all the songs on the cd. All of the songs had a nice balance between the heavy metal guitar riffs and delicate goth melodies.

I don't really consider myself a diehard fan of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds but I do like a good deal of his work. I recently picked up a copy of B-SIDES & RARITIES from my library because I wanted to re-acquaint myself with his music (it has been a few years since I have listened to Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds). It did not take me very long to remember why I like Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds. I just love Nick Cave's deep baritone voice. I am often reminded of one of my favorite singers Voltaire. I enjoyed most of the songs on the album, like the beautiful cover of "What a Wonderful World" and a different version of "Where the Wild Roses Grow" (minus Kylie Minogue). There were a small handful of songs I wasn't too keen on but otherwise this anthology of rare and unheard tracks by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is a nice reminder to Nick Cave's talents as a singer/songwriter.

I'm not really much of a U2 fan. I do enjoy some of their music, all of the music I like by the band comes from the 1980s. THE JOSHUA TREE is my favorite U2 cd from that era. The band may be Christians and express their beliefs through their music on this album but what I like is that the songs on this album is more spiritual than religious. The themes on every song can be easily relatable to anyone of any faith (or no faith), like on "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and "Where the Streets Have No Name". After all these years I still cannot get tired of listening to some of U2's biggest hits like the aforementioned tracks, and "With or Without You". My personal favorite song on the entire album is the gorgeous lush ballad "Running to Stand Still". The song still sends chill down my spine. "With or Without You" is a another great ballad that I still love after all these years. It is never cliched or condescending. Bono's lyrics on the album are like poetry in my opinion. The rest of the band compliments Bono's lyrics and functions very well as one cohesive unit. Bono may be horrified or embarassed of this era but frankly he has nothing to be ashamed of, it is current work that he should be embarassed for. THE JOSHUA TREE remains an eternal classic unlike the band's last studio album.

Both APPLESEED and APPLESEED EX MACHINA are my favorite anime films in recent months. When I found out that the creators of APPLESEED is behind the film VEXILLE, I knew I had to check out VEXILLE. Needless to say the creators of APPLESEED really outdid themselves with VEXILLE.VEXILLE is named after the heroine of the story. She is a member of a special ops force called S.W.O.R.D. The story takes place in 2077. It has been ten years since Japan had isolated itself from the rest of the world based on an international treaty that limits the use of robotic technology. During a mission, it is revealed that Japan had been developing androids thus leads to a new mission to if this really is the case. Vexille's lover Leon volunteers to lead a team to infiltrate Japan. When Vexille finds out, she manages to get involved in the mission. Of course, the plan quickly goes awry. Leon and his team goes missing, and Vexille ends up in the company of a mysterious woman named Maria and her group of ragtag rebels who wants to put a stop to the corporation responsible for the creation of androids and abuse of bio-technology.The animation was nothing short of amazing. The animation was quite similiar to the APPLESEED films which is a mix of hand drawn art (or what it looks like)and computer generated images. I found the film to be fast paced and never boring. Paul Oakenfold's techno film score was quite good and really fit the theme of the film. I can hardly wait to see what the folks behind APPLESEED and VEXILLE does next. They made me a huge fan out of me.

I can't say I am a fan of musicals. I find most musicals to be annoying (like "Grease"), "Bride & Prejudice" isn't one of those annoying musicals. "Bride & Prejudice" is one of my favorite films from 2004, if not all time favorite film. The film is loosely (and I mean loosely) based on Jane Austen's "Pride & Prejudice" which is given a Bollywood treatment.India's biggest film star Aishwarya Rai plays Lalita Bakshi, the second eldest daughter in the Bakshi family. Her mother is obsessed with marrying off her four daughters to well to do suitors as quickly as possible. This doesn't sit well with Lalita because she is strong-willed, independent, and doesn't want to settle for any man. When Lalita meets the wealthy William Darcy (Martin Henderson of "Torque" and "The Ring"), sparks immediately flys between the two but so does strong opinions as well. Lalita also meets up with a grifter named Johnny Wickham (Daniel Giles) who shares a past with Darcy.The good: I loved the music. The music was irresistably catchy. The first time I saw this film in the theatre, the music immediately got stuck in my head. The songs had the right hooks to leave an immediate impression on me. I just loved the musical numbers period. The comic relief of Nitin Ganatra as Mr. Kohli, the would be suitor of Lalita. Nitin is absolutely hilarious as the goofy, obnoxious but kind Mr. Kohli. The costumes were absolutely beautiful. Loved the outtakes during the credits at the end of the film.The not so good: the writing of the film is a bit spotty but if you watch the behind the scenes making of the film, Gurinder Chadha explains how she wanted to capture the essence of the Jane Austen novel. Anyone who is expecting a word for word interpretation of "Pride & Prejudice" will be sorely disappointed in the film. I wished Gurinder would have been a bit more detailed about Johnny Wickham's past.DVD features: there is a fifteen minute behind the scenes footage of the making of the film, extended musical numbers, and interviews with Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai.Overall "Bride and Prejudice" is a massively fun film to watch. The music is catchy. The pace of the storyline is brisk and never slows down for a moment. Great cast. I never tire of watching this delightful film.

Heart was the very first band I paid to go see live in concert back in high school. Ann Wilson was one of my favorite singers in rock music. When I heard that Ann was finally putting out a solo album of cover songs and duets with other well known artists, I thought it was worth checking out and see how Ann's voice has fared over the years. Unfortunately I do not think time has been very kind to Ann Wilson's voice. I was hoping to hear the Ann that I loved circa "Barracuda" and "Little Queen". What I got was a raspy, flat Ann Wilson. No matter how many times I have listened to HOPE & GLORY, I felt so underwhelmed by the material. The only moment that Ann came close to her hard rock roots of the '70s is on the song "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" but otherwise I missed her Robert Plant-like vocals. I was so disappointed in her cover of Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song". I was hoping she would totally rock out on this song but it is anything but hard rock. Her vocals are the saving grace of this tepid cover. The worst song on the album? "Where to Now St. Peter?". Ann's vocals do not mesh well with Elton John's bombastic vocals which totally ruined the song for me. The only songs that I actually didn't have an adverse reaction to is "Get Together" (although I wish there weren't so many people singing on the song with Ann), and "Isolation", everything else was dreadful. I really tried to like this album but I just couldn't. Sorry Ann. This album failed me both conceptually and musically. P.S...I know I am going to get hit with a lot of negative votes for this review. What I have written is my personal opinion.

I have to admit I have been more of a casual Assemblage 23 fan in the last several years I have been listening to EBM. From what little I heard, Tom Shear's music was a bit on the monotonous side for me. That is until now. I always wanted to get the latest A23 album META but never got around to it...until recently. In the past the material I heard was good but didn't really stick with me. META is the first A23 cd that I could really sink my teeth into. The cd opens up with "Decades [V2}" the most awesome club song that I have heard in recent years. Every time I listen to the song, I crank up the stereo and start dancing. The song has catchy pop hooks and a lot of energy. It is hard not to want to dance to this song. Another great song that makes me want to dance is "Sorry". Of course there are a few slower songs on the album. Of the mid-tempo songs on the album, I liked "Damaged" the best. I can feel the emotions that Tom Shear emits when he sings this song. No matter how many times I have listened to META, I have not been able to find a song I did not enjoy. For me Tom Shear finally executed an album where I love the entire album. META is flawless in my eyes.

I guess I'll be one of the few people who still enjoys watching the television adaptation of the Stephen King classic "It". Unfortunately the Stephen King novel was so long not everything in the book could be included in the tv mini-series otherwise the tv mini-series would have probably been a week long mini-series. I can understand why fans of the novel is not enamoured with the film unlike me.The storyline takes place in Derry, Maine. The small town is plagued by a series of mysterious killings of children by a monster that adults are unable (and in serious denial) to believe in. This monster comes in the form of the extremely creepy Pennywise the clown played by the brilliant Tim Curry who made me see clowns in a whole new light after seeing the film. Tim Curry's performance truly stood out for me. I still get the goose bumps whenever I come across "It" on cable tv.The protagonists of the story is a small circle of childhood friends who were considered outcasts by their peers and losers by a group of psychotic bullies. The cast is rounded out by Harry Anderson, John Ritter, Jonathan Brandis, Seth Green, Annette O'Toole, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, Emily Perkins, Ben Heller, Olivia Hussey, and Dennis Christopher.The film begins with a phone call from Mike Hanlon (Tim Reid) to his friends when the killings begins again after their last encounter with Pennywise. While everyone had left Derry, Mike remained in town as the unofficial watcher of It. This is not a happy reunion to say the very least. The story goes between the past and present.I personally enjoyed the film adapation a lot. Yes it is a very condensed version of the novel but ya can't cram every single detail from the book into the film within a certain amount of time. Every scene with Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown sent the hairs on the back of my neck straight up, especially the opening sequence when he encounters Bill's younger brother George Denbrough. The confrontation between the grown up friends and the flesh eating spider was cheesy, if not laughable. Despite the obvious edits and cheesy confrontation, I still love "It". This is the only film that creeps me out. Eat your heart out Michael Myers, Freddie Krueger, and Jason Voorhees.

Tori Amos is easily my favorite solo artist. I have always liked that her music was nothing like most female singer/songwriters who tends to be bland and tepid like Sarah McLachlan and Jewel. Unfortunately Tori's music hasn't always been consistently good. Tori has a terrible tendency to be a bit too conceptual lyrically speaking as well as put out cds that are a bit too long than they really should (i.e Boys for Pele and The Beekeeper). Tori's latest effort American Doll Posse unfortunately is longer than it really should have been. For me seventy eight minutes was a bit much. It just made it difficult for the music to digest.The concept American Doll Posse is vaguely similiar to Tori's cover albums Strange Little Girls (her last cd for Atlantic Records) in which she creates five different personas for certain songs. I'm not really sure if that was really necessary. I found the idea to be rather pretentious. As for the songs themselves, there were a few clunkers but for the most part I enjoyed the album. There were moments when I felt like I was hearing bits and pieces of Tori's earlier albums. It was deja vu all over again. There are two songs on the cd that really stood out for me, the first is "Secret Spell" and the other is "Velvet Revolution". I found the songs addictively catchy. Love the pop hooks.I wish I could say this is Tori's best album to date but I can't. American Doll Posse may not be perfect but I still like it. I definitely like this album moreso than The Beekeeper.

I was a freshmen in college in the mid '90s when I discovered the joys of Siouxsie & The Banshees. I bought a singles compilation of their music and was immediately hooked. I recently had a Siouxsie and the Banshees revival when I came across the song "The Ghost in You" online. It quickly rekindled my love for the band and I ended up purchasing a copy of their album Superstition. I almost forgot how much I have loved the songs "Kiss Them For Me" and "Fear (of the Unknown)". Superstition may be a poppier album compared to their older work but I still love it all the same. I love the melodies and Siouxsie's vocals on this album. I found myself really enjoying the songs "Cry", "Little Sister", "Silver Waterfalls" and of course "Ghost in Me". I love all of the songs. The album may be 20 years old but it does not sound remotely dated with me. Anything this band has done still sounds fresh and new for me.

Chill out compilations are a dime a dozen nowadays. There aren't many chill out compilations that really stands out with me. There are only four series that I can really recommend, the Buddha Bar series, Siddharta series, Chill Out in Paris series, and Hed Kandi's Winter Chill series. I discovered Hed Kandi's Winter chill series a few years ago on a whim. I was automatically hooked. I recently came across volume 2 last week and decided to get it even though I am not as big of a fan of the chill out scene nowadays.WINTER CHILL VOL. 2 is good but predictable. Disc one has all your standard chill out tracks that I have heard on other compilations over the years like the tiresome "Silence" by Delerium, Moby's "Porcelain", Goldfrapp's "Utopia", and Chicane's "No Ordinary Morning". The songs that really stood out with me is Dusted's "Always Remember to Respect Your Mother Part 1", and The Beloved's "Deliver Me". It was really interesting male vocals on "Deliver Me". I was so used to hearing Sarah Brightman's delicate vocals on that song. I have always loved "Always Remember to Respect Your Mother Part 1" by Dusted (a side project by Faithless' Rollo). I love the classical melodies and the beautiful female vocals. I also enjoyed tracks by Bent, Afterlife, and Aware.Disc 2 is pretty good. I didn't think it was as good as the first disc but it still had some tasty chill out tracks by the likes of Paul Van Dyk, The Angelica Project, Smith & Mighty, and Lux. I will say that on disc 2, the song selection isn't as predictable as disc 1 is. Both discs are perfect to listen to on a cold winter night, wrapped in your favorite blanket, and drinking a steaming cup of tea or hot chocolate. The music is very soothing to the weary soul.

I like to consider myself a big movie buff. One of my personal favorite films from this decade is "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". I am not a Jim Carrey but the premise of the film still intrigued me.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet plays a dysfunctional couple named Joel and Clementine. The couple are polar opposites from one another. Joel is more quiet and reserved while Clementine is more gregarious and unpredictable. These personality differences makes their relationship far from dull. After having a huge blow out with Joel, Clementine decides to have her memories of Joel erased courtesy of Howard (Tom Wilkinson) and his assistants played by Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Woods. When Joel finds out about what Clementine did, he decides to get the same procedure done on him. During the process of having his memories of Clementine erased (which is basically a lobotomy), Joel relizes that he still loves Clementine and does not want to forget her.I loved this film right from the first time I saw this film in the theatre but I really didn't get it until I viewed it a few more times on dvd. The way the film is edited is a bit confusing but the more I have watched it, the more the film makes sense. What I saw was a history of Joel and Clementine's rocky relationship. The performances was great. It was nice to see Jim Carrey actually tone down his comedic schtick and Kate Winslet take on a more comedic role. The writing and directingis just as good. Too bad most films in the past two years haven't come close to the uniqueness of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind".

Awhile back I had heard samples of ONE CELL IN THE SEA by A Fine Frenzy (aka Alison Sudol). I definitely was intrigued by what I heard. I finally got around to getting a copy of the cd. The music is pleasant if not predictable, safe, and redundant. Don't get me wrong, the music is nice however the songs sounds too much the same. I was listening to the cd at work the other day, I swear I felt like I was listening to the same song over and over. Good pop hooks but Alison doesn't offer anything new or different to me that I haven't heard before in other singer/songwriters like Ani Difranco (to a certain extent), Tori Amos, and Sarah McLachlan. The songs I heard on ONE CELL IN THE SEA sounds like they would be perfect for the maudlin BS that the CW Network passes off for television drama. I don't doubt that Alison Sudol has talent. I just hope that she stretches beyond her brand of piano/pop music in the future because I almost fell asleep at work while listening to her album.

Last month I had the opportunity to hear BACK TO BLACK by Amy Winehouse courtesy of a co-worker of mine. Normally my musical preferences is at the opposite end of the spectrum (darker and more aggressive) but in Amy's case I loved what I heard. I finally got a hold of my own copy of BACK TO BLACK. I have been listening to the cd non-stop. I really don't care for r&b music. Today's r&b is slickly overproduced. Amy's music has a vintage Motown influence with a splash of jazz thrown in to the mix. The production is gritty like a lot of old school r&b/soul music were back in the day. I like how unique Amy's vocals are. They have a slighty whiney, raspy edge but without being annoying. I think the standout track on the entire album is the hilarious "Rehab". Gotta love the lyrics. Another great track is "You Know I'm No Good". For some odd reason the song sounded like it would have been great for the great Shirley Bassey to sing. Not wild about the rap on the remixed version of the song. I wished the album wasn't so short but on the other hand it left me very eager to hear more from Amy.

There aren't a lot of pop singers out there that I think is worth listening to. Most I find to be artistically changelleged. One of the few pop singers I do like is Dido. I first discovered her through the UK dance act Faithless. Her brother Rollo would often include her vocals on the group's songs. I later discovered her through cable tv and saw that she was a solo artist. "No Angel" is a pleasant but predictable mix of trip hop, pop, and folk music. The one song I cannot listen to any more is "Thank You" and that is because it was overplayed on radio stations 24/7 after Eminem's "Stan" (which took samples from "Thank You") became a smash hit. My personal favorite track on the cd is the folksy "Don't Think". I find the song addictively catchy and the melodies stick in my head for days on end. I also enjoy the haunting track "Here with Me". Sure the song is commonly found on many chill out compilations and soundtracks but it wasn't as annoying as "Thank You". Yeah the music is bit bland and inoffensive, and isn't the best representation of what trip hop music is. For all its quibbles, I still enjoy this cd to this very day. I find the music very soothing and relaxing to listen to on a snowy, winter day.

I am a new fan to Pzychobitch's music. I bought "Electrolicious" on a whim. I heard a few samples of the songs off this album and thought it was worth checking out. I have to admit that it took me several listens for the album to grow on me. The music was more electroclash ala Fischerspooner and Goldfrapp than industrial sounding. Songs like "Cold Comfort" sounded a bit too repetitive for my liking. I wasn't too wild about the beats either which did have some industrial elements. One of the few tracks that did stand out with me from the initial listen is the title track which was upbeat and infectious. After a few listens I have started to love the song "Strom aus Fantasie" mainly because I love hearing Sina sing in German. Initially I wasn't too wild about the beats and the melodies but over time I have warmed up to them. "Go P***y Go" reminded me lyrically of the classic Lords of Acid song "P***y", very humorous. The song is too repetitive and eventually the song loses its charm with me. "Electricious" isn't what I was expecting or hoping it would sound but I like it for most of the time.

VNV Nation is easily one of my all time favorite bands. I discovered VNV Nation about four years ago and have been hooked since then. What has always appealed to me is the combination of heartfelt lyrics and epic dance beats. I consider the band's third album "Empires" to be classic VNV Nation. After seven years since its release, "Empires" still sounds remarkably fresh with its crisp, infectious synth melodies. My favorite song has to be the lush ballad "Standing" with its haunting melodies and emotionally moving lyrics. The combination of the melodies and lyrics always moves me to the very core of my soul every time I listen to the song. I think this song is one of the best songs Ronan Harris has ever written. The lyrics to "Kingdom" are also great in an epic and grandeur sense. My favorite instrumental track is "Saviour". I will say that I prefer the vox version of "Saviour" (found on the rare "Burning Empires" EP). The instrumental track has a good dance beat. I like the build up in the song but the song is a lot better with Ronan's vocals. I am not really too big on the other instrumental tracks on the album like "Firstlight". They didn't have the same catchy pop hooks that "Saviour" has. Another minor flaw is that Ronan's vocals tends to be monotonous. Most of the time I am not bother by his vocals but if I am not in a good mood, I will tend to find his vocals rather annoying but that is rare. Another great song on the album is "Fragments" which is a bit more harsh and abrasive than "Standing" and "Kingdom". The high level of energy in the song shines through and will make the listener want to jump and down. "Distant (Rubicon II)" turns down a few notches. It is another wonderful ballad. It is a nice segueway into "Standing". If there was one album by VNV Nation I would recommend to anyone curious about the band, I strongly recommend getting "Empires" first.

In one of those rare moments in life, my mother actually introduced me to George Winston's music when I was in high school. Most of the music I listened to at the time was metal and punk music. George Winston was an antithesis to everything I listened to still his music was very relaxing to listen to. DECEMBER is easily my favorite Winston cd.I like that the music was just George playing the piano. His music isn't bogged down by other instruments which would have easily drowned out his piano playing. I love listening to DECEMBER at any time of the year although there are some Christmas carols. I find George's delicate piano melodies quite relaxing. No matter how old DECEMBER is, the music never gets old with me. I still love the cd after all these years.

LA TERZA MADRE (or MOTHER OF TEARS) is the third and final film in Dario Argento's Three Mothers trilogy. Dario's daughter Asia Argento stars in the film as Sarah Mandy, an American student working in a museum in Rome, Italy. Rome is the last city where the last witch Mother of Tears resides in.When an ancient urn is located, it is sent to the museum in Rome where Sarah and her boyfriend Michael (Adam James) works. Unbeknownst to them, Sarah and her co-worker Giselle (the stunning Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni) breaks the seal to the urn and unleashes an unspeakable evil. That evil is the last and final witch Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias). With her powers restored, she and her followers plagues the city of Rome with violence, murder, rapes, and suicides. To say that all heck broke loose would be putting it mildly. When Sarah finds out about her family ties to the Mother of Tears witch, it is up to her to destroy her once and for all.The violence was over the top and a visual eye candy for those who love their horror films to be gory and bloody. The first ten minutes of the film was an indication of what was to come through out the film. For me, the violence was a bit much but I will give Dario credit for giving his victims an interesting and colorful death. It is easily one of the most memorable death scenes I have ever seen which is a good thing. The performances were campy and over the top but then again what performances aren't in the horror genre? Still I did like the camp value in the actors' performances especially Udo Kier, who makes a cameo appearance in the film. As much as I liked the film score, film score was obnoxious and distracting. Sometimes less is more, and I think this film would have benefitted from that concept. For all the gore in the film, it was not bad in comparison to the stupid anti-climatic ending which left me thinking "is that it?!". I wished Dario could have come up with a better scenerio than what he did in the film. Another flaw with the film is the scenes between Sarah and her deceased mother (Asia's real life mother). They were unbelievably corny and too Obi-Wan Knobi-ish. And if Sarah was supposed to be a witch, why was she only given the power of invisibility? Talk about lame.I may not be into horror films as I once was as a teenager but to see a Dario Argento film in the theatre and not on dvd was a real visual treat for my eyes. MASTER OF TEARS is definitely not for the casual horror fan. The death scenes depicted in the film is graphic and cringe-worthy at times. For fans of today's brand of horror fans or Dario Argento's films, this is definitely worth seeing in the theatre if you can.

"Bride & Prejudice" is one of my top 20 all time favorite films. I had seen it twice in the theatre last year and dozens of times on dvd. I never get sick of the film. One of the main reasons I love the film is the music. I love the blend of traditional Indian music with modern pop music. My personal favorite numbers are the uptempo tracks like "A Marriage Has Come to Town" and the hilarious number "No Life Without Wife" where Lalita and her sisters mocks Mr. Kohli. "A Marriage Has Come to Town" is absolutely my favorite song on the cd. I can still see Lalita and her friends walking through the marketplace, singing and dancing to this song. What I find so odd is that the ballad "Arrogance, Pride, and Vanity" isn't really heard much in the film. You can hear a few notes being played during the scenes where Darcy and Lalita are walking all over the beach, separately. I wasn't big on the two Ashanti tracks. I have never been convinced that she was a remotely half decent singer, and these songs proved me right that her voice is extremely weak, especially on "Touch My Body" (my least favorite song on the cd). despite the flaws, I wish that soundtracks today were as vibrant and colorful as "Bride and Prejudice" is.

I am a great admirer of composer Paul schwartz. My favorite Paul Schwartz project has to be State of Grace. The lyrics are often taken from Latin text with some english written text. The music is a delicate fusion of classical melodies and subtle electronic beats. On every of the three State of Grace cds, Paul has used Lisbeth Scott whose voice can be heard on the soundtracks to "The Passion of the Christ" and "The Chronicles of Narnia". Her voice is perfect with Paul's compositions.The first "State of Grace" cd is a classic for me. I wasn't too impressed with the second SoG cd. It was good but the music did not captivate me like the first cd did. Thankfully new "State of Grace" cd is not a lackluster. The compositions are more memorable than the songs on the previous SoG cd. Listening to Lisbeth Scott's ethereal vocals on "Beams of Heaven" quickly reminded me why I fell in love with State of Grace to begin with. "Center of My Heart" is another wonderful song with the acoustic guitars, Lisbeth's vocals, and the emotionally stirring lyrics. There is a sense of intimacy in the song that is rarely heard in most music nowadays. I felt like I was in the studio watching Lisbeth sing. I also loved the gorgeous orchestral track "Lux Aeterna". I found the track very calming. All of the songs on the third SoG cd is soothing to listen to.

It seems like nowadays the term girl groups is synonymous with talent-challenged acts like The Pussycat Dolls who relies more on sex appeal than on actual talent. Thankfully there are a couple of girl groups from the UK who actually has talent. The first is The Puppini Sisters and the second is The Pipettes.I recently discovered The Pipettes after reading about them in a local paper. I finally got a hold of the trio's cd WE ARE THE PIPETTES earlier this week and have been listening to it non-stop. The Pipettes brings the past and present together in their delightful mix of '60s pop and modern indie rock. All three Pipettes prove their vocal prowess with their ability to harmonize on all fourteen tracks. I can't pick out a single favorite song on the album because I love every track on the cd. I get a huge smile on my face whenever I listen to WE ARE THE PIPETTES.RiotBecki, Gwenno and Rosay are backed up by a group of musicians called The Cassettes with Jon on bass, Seb on keyboards, Robin on drums, and Bobby on guitars. It would be too easy to write off The Pipettes as a manufactured pop act with their kitschy matching outfits but who cares if they are? Their music is a boat loads of fun to listen to on whenever or wherever you are.

Red Doors is a film about a dysfunctional Chinese-American family living in a suburb in New York. The parents Ed Wong (Tzi Ma) and May-Li Wong (Freda Foh Shen) have three daughters: Sam (Jacqueline Kim) who is the oldest, Elaine Kao (Julie) is the middle child, and the youngest daughter is Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee).Ed had just retired and is trying to figure out how to excape the dullness of his life. His daughters are experiencing their own dysfunctional dramas.Sam is a business woman who is getting ready for her impending nuptials to Mark (Jayce Bartok) but when an old high school flame returns to town, Sam begins to question if she is ready for marriage. Julie who is a med student who is excelling at her studies but when it comes to her personal life, she doesn' t exactly get a passing grade due to her acute shyness. Her world is quickly turned upside down when she meets a popular actress named Mia Scarlett (Mia Riverton), and eventually becomes romantically involved with the actress. Katie is engaged in a prank war with her next door neighbor's son Simon (Sebastian Stan). When Ed suddenly up and leaves the family, the girls are forced to re-examine their lives and how to live on accordingly to what their heart says, not what is expected of them by family obligations (sort of an invisible fence).I loved Red Doors. The home video footage of which I assume is from Georgia Lee's childhood added an authentic feel to the film. The ending though left me a bit unsatisfied. I hate it when films end on such a broad note. I was hoping that this film would have come to one of my local arthouse theatres but it didn't. I had to wait for it to come out on dvd. The relationship between Julie and Mia reminded me that of Wil and Vivian in the other Asian American filmSaving Face(which is one of my all time faovrite films). It was complicated because Julie is more introverted while Mia is more extroverted, plus Mia was a popular actress which throws a monkey wrench into their relationship. Still the way the conflict was resolved between Julie and Mia was certainly more realistic than Wil and Vivan's. There is an obvious great love between the family members in the film especially between the mother and her daughters. I wish the film ended with some sort of resolution to the father's situation. Overall excellent film.

I am not really a major fan of pop music but I do like some pop music. Just not the garbage that is being churned out by the boat loads nowadays. My personal favorite pop group of all time is easily ABBA. Their songs always puts a huge smile on my face. To be honest I never head of ABBA until I was in college. ABBA's GOLD cd was a college mainstay at house parties I attended. Most of GOLD is classic pop but there are a couple of songs that I am not really fond of like "Thank You for the Music" and "Dancing Queen" (the most overplayed song from my college days). My personal favorite songs are "Take a Chance On Me", "Super Trooper", and "Waterloo". Lyrically, ABBA's music is horrible, case in point "Super Trooper". What makes their music so much fun for me is the melodies which tends to stick in my head for days on end. Ten years after owning GOLD, I still love listening to ABBA's music. They are my #1 guilty pleasure.

I'm pretty new to Rotersand's music. "Welcome to Goodbye" is my first introduction to the band. Rotersand may not be VNV Nation or Apoptygma Berzerk but I thought "Welcome to Goodbye" was enjoyable. There definitely is a Pink Floyd element in the band's music especially in the vocals but for the most part Rotersand's music is your standard EBM. The production is perfect. It has a good live vibe to it. There are lots of good hooks and good beats. Tracks like "Dare to Live" and "The Last Ship pt. 1" made me want to get up and dance. Unfortunately what plagues this album is repetition but then again repetition often plagues many electronic based music. "Exterminate Annihilate Destroy" gets pretty tiresome after a couple of minutes of listening to the obnoxious synthesized beats.The same can be said about "Almost Wasted" except the beats aren't so obnoxious. "Welcome to Goodbye" is good, not perfect but good. I have definitely heard better EBM cds than Rotersand's recent effort.

I may not be as big of a fan of Bond as I once was but every now and then I like to listen to the group's music to take the edge off. I have to admit I wasn't really that thrilled with Bond's second album SHINE. The material on their sophomore album was lacking some of the energy that made BORN such a great album. With their third studio album CLASSIFIED quickly reminded me why I love the band so much. The energy is more evident on this album than on SHINE. Granted I don't think anything that the group will do will match the high energy and beauty of BORN. There were a couple of songs that were less than stellar like "Fly Robin Fly" and "Midnight Garden" but I still enjoyed the album for what it is which is fun listening to music. My favorite songs on the album is "Lullaby" and "Adagio for Strings". I am particularly fond of "Lullaby" since it is an updated version of Pachelbel's "Canon", my all time favorite baroque piece. I like the addition of the percussion and vocalizations to the track. Bond's music may not be fluff to some people but to me it is a lot of fun to listen to especially after spending eight hours of listening to gothic and industrial music while at the office.

I am not a fan of today's pop music. I find most, if not all of it dreadful. Lo and behold I discovered a pop artist worth listening to and that is Lily Allen. I received a copy of Lily's debut album "Alright, Still" from a friend this weekend and I have not been able to stop listening to the cd. Lily's music is an assortment of musical influences that ranges from dancehall, pop, rock, and hip hop, music I certainly don't listen to on a regular basis. The songs have an endearing quality because of the humorous but never stupid lyrics. Lily Allen does not take herself so seriously which a lot of pop artists tends to do nowadays (i.e Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Avril Lavigne). While I do love all of the songs on the album, my personal favorite has to be "Alfie". The song is riddled with the catchiest pop hooks I have heard in the past twelve months. A few songs took some time to grow on me like "Shame For You" overall though the cd is quite good. I wish pop music sounded as good as "Alright, Still", I would listen to it more often but alas it doesn't. In the meantime I will settle for listening to this gem of a pop album. I can't wait to hear more from Lily Allen.

I first discovered Bond on a cable tv several years ago and was automatically hooked on their fusion of pop and classical music. Their debut album BORN is one of my all time favorite cds. The music has a lot of energy. When the group released their follow up SHINE, I was a bit let down because the music was lacking the raw energy and enthusiasm for music that I could hear on BORN. SHINE isn't terrible or a sophomore jinx to me but I think it could have been a lot better. I think one of the problems with this cd is that the band begins to tread more into the pop territory by covering the James Bond theme and Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir". The Bond theme was boring as heck but I did like "Kashmir". Hopefully the group will be able to re-capture the energy that made me fall in love with their music in the first place.

I love happy accidents. Angelzoom is one of my favorite happy accidents of late. I stumbled upon the band on the internet. When I heard samples of their music, I was immediately hooked. Angelzoom is quite a contrast to Claudia Uhle's other band X-Perience. The music is not so heavy on the electronic sounds and more piano based than synth based. The music has a classical/new age sound with elements of ambient and goth. Claudia has a beautiful voice. Her voice is very clear and it matches well with the intricate melodies. It is really difficult for me to pick out a favorite song on the cd because I love each and one of them. I enjoyed the band's interpretations of "Blasphemous Rumors" and "Crawling" (especially since I am no fan of Linkin Park). You wouldn't think that a Linkin Park song wouldn't sound good as a classical/pop/ambient song but it does. I hope that "Angelzoom" isn't a one album project because I really loved what I heard on this cd.

Curve is one of those bands whom I really didn't appreciate their music until years after they broke up. I recently acquired a copy of their four song EP Frozen. This was one of their handful of EPs the band released prior to Pubic Fruit album which consists of tracks from the EPs. Even after 20 years since its release, Frozen does not sound obsolete. Dean Garcia's jingly guitar riffs and Toni Halliday's seductive vocals compliments each other very well. There is not one single bad track on the EP.

"Corpse Bride" is one of my favorite films from last year as well as being one of my favorite Tim Burton films. Tim's approach to animation in this film is absolutely amazing. If anyone can make stop and go animation look appealing, it is Tim Burton. When I first saw this film in the theatre, I have to admit I was rather surprised by the whimsicalness of the film. I was left with the impression that it was going to be a bit darker. Thankfully the whimsical feel of the film works, or at least for me it did.Johnny Depp does the voice for Victor Van Dort, a shy young man who is about to marry Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) through an arrangement with both parents of the couple. After a botched attempt with his wedding vows at the rehearsal, Victor goes off into the woods to practice his vows. He unwittingly ends up proposing to a corpse bride name Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and he ends up going to the land of the dead with his new bride.Danny Elfman's score gives this delightful film that whimsical edge. I thought the color contrasts between the land of the dead and living was interesting and unique. I liked how in the land of the living, the colors consisted of dark hues while in the land, the colors were bright and vibrant.The choices in actors to voice the characters in the film were as always a wonderful choice. Gotta love Tracey Ullman as Victor's mother Nell Van Dort and Joanna Lumley (of AbFab fame) as Maudeline Everglot.The bonus features on the dvd were brief but nevertheless a delight to get a behind the scenes glimpse of the making of the film.

There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic "Mezzanine" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.What I love about "Mezzanine" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as "Mezzanine" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs "Angel" and "Risingon" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to "Teardrop" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. "Mezzanine" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.

A few weeks ago I discovered the Swedish band Code 64 via Youtube. I had found a clip to the song "Every Moment". Now former singer Henrik Piehl's gentle vocals, club friendly dance beats, and addictive pop hooks quickly captivated me. After listening to some more songs like the infectious "Sea of Stars" and "Run to You", I knew I had to buy their album Departure in which the songs can be found on. Ever since I received the album just yesterday, I have been unable to stop listening to it. I am simply hooked on the melodies, pulsating dance beats and Henrik's vocals. The songs are really fun to listen or to dance to. Despite the fact that Henrik left the band, I am looking forward to the group's next album. I definitely recommend for synthpop fans to check out Code 64 and their Departure album. You can't go wrong with this album.

I first discovered The Raveonettes at a local book store a few years ago. I listened to a few songs off the cd and was immediately hooked on the music. Normally I am not into that garage rock sound and I like my music darker and more aggressive. The Raveonettes certainlly has that of The Jesus and Mary Chain sound going for them with the distorted guitars. It would be hard not to hear the comparisons to The Jesus and Mary Chain. Never had I heard songs as melodic as what I heard on "The Chain Gang of Love". The infectious melodies reminded me of Buddy Holly and The Ronettes. There isn't one song on the album that I did not like. For me this is my favorite Raveonettes cd because this is what got me into the band.

I have to admit I am new to Nouvelle Vague. I have heard of them in magazine but never got around to checking out their music. I finally did this weekend when I found Nouvelle Vague's self-titled album. When I looked at the track list on the back of the cd, I knew I had to hear it, especially since I love Joy Division and Depeche Mode. NOUVELLE VAGUE is an intersting collection of post-punk songs given a lounge make over. I thought the concept was interesting but I found my patience stretched to its limits because the kitschy novelty of remaking popular post-punk songs from the '80s got tiresome. Another aspect I didn't care much for about the music is that Nouvelle Vague took a bunch of distinctive songs and turned them into boring, repetive lounge songs. Every song on the cd lost its distinct sound to the annoying kitschy lounge sound. While I am not overly fond of the cd, there were a few tracks that I did enjoy like "Love Will Tear Us Apart", and "Just Can't Get Enough". I really wanted to like this cd but I just couldn't. Sorry but this concept of turning new wave songs into lounge music is a horrible idea.

I have been a big fan of the X-Men juggernaut from comic books to tv series. The first two X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer were surprisingly entertaining and captured the essence of the X-Men. Brett Ratner did not with the third X-Men film X3: The Last Stand. The general premise of the film revolves around a 'cure' for mutants created by Warren Worthington III's father. I couldn't help but draw comparison between this storyline with the ex-gay movement Exodus which claims to cure homosexuality. I think it would be difficult not to see this comparison between the Exodus movement and this cure to treat mutants and get rid of what humans perceived as to be a sickness. This 'cure' quickly stirs up strong emotions with Magneto and the Brotherhood as well as Charles Xavier and his X-Men, especially Storm, and eventually the two sides has one last final showdown.I admit I was pretty much entertained by the film but it was all flash and not a lot of substance. While I appreciated the fact that the screenwriters incorporated glimpses of the dark phoenix storyline where Jean Grey comes back to life but as a darker, more powerful character but for the most part the writing was mediocre at best. The writers totally veered away from the heart and soul of the comic book series. I didn't like seeing a few of the major characters be written off so quickly. The dialogue was extremely cheesy, more so than the previous X-Men films.What I did like was seeing a bit more of Colossus, one of my favorite X-Men characters (although not enough), more screen time for Halle Berry as Storm, the opening sequence where the young students are in danger room being trained in combat, and the special effects. Overall I was sorely disappointed. This is not the way I wanted this series to end.

Like many people, I discovered Bird York through the film CRASH. I was immediately taken in by Bird's sensuous vocals. I recently got around to getting her cd WICKED LITTLE HIGH. I have been listening to the cd quite a bit. Everytime I have listened to it, the music just gets better and better. Bird's brand of pop/rock music may not be what I usually listen to on a regular basis but I find it very pleasing and relaxing to. Bird York has a similiar polished voice that reminds me of Zero 7's Sia, and Sarah McLachlan. Her music is primarily pop but there is definite hints of folk, rock, and jazz (which is very subtle). Other than the gorgeous "In the Deep" which remains one of my favorite pop ballads in recent years, I adore the song "Save Me". The song shares the same haunting quality that has made me come to love "In the Deep". I also enjoy Bird's uptempo tracks like "Remedy" and "Wicked Little High". WICKED LITTLE HIGH is a terrific album. I enjoyed listening to it without skipping a single song on the album. It is a nice cd to listen to on a cold winter night with a book and a steaming cup of tea.

I must confess...I never really had a high opinion of Il Divo. Anything that Simon Cowell touches I try to avoid like the plague. A couple of months ago on my local PBS station I caught a performance from Il Divo. I have to admit I was hooked line and sinker especially when they sung an Italian version of Mariah Carey's "Hero". I finally broke down and actually acquired an Il Divo cd via my cd club (and for free too). The cd I got was "Ancora", the group's second album. Well the sentimental sap in me fell in love with "Ancora". Yes it is schmaltzy and over the top with the guy's operatic vocals. Unfortunately they had to do an unnecessary cover of "You Raise Me Up". Enough! Everyone under the sun has covered that song and it has become tiresome. Il Divo's version offers nothing new or anything interesting. I'll take Celtic Woman and Josh Groban's version over Il Divo's any day. As much as I don't like Celine Dion (which would be putting it mildly), I have to admit I loved the gorgeous ballad "I Believe in You". Celine actually didn't bother me for once and I thought her vocals complimented nicely with the guys in Il Divo. "Ancora" is a bit too short. It falls just under 40 minutes but I guess that beats listening to a cd over an hour long with music I do not like. Does my enjoyment of "Ancora" mean that I have become a fan of Il Divo? No. I still find their music schmaltzy and overly dramatic. Guilty pleasure? Yes.

A few years ago I was really into downtempo/chillout music but over the years, the genre has lost its appeal to me. Everything essentially sounds the same to me. Just when I have given up on this genre, my interest has been piqued again by newcomer Kate Havnevik. I discovered her on the internet earlier this year but it wasn't until recently when I acquired a copy of her debut album MELANKTON did I fall in love with her brand of gentle, soothing chillout music. The first thing I have noticed about her music was how similiar she sounded to Bjork but minus the obnoxious caterwauling. Kate also reminds me a little of ex-Frou Frou singer Imogen Heap. Ironically Kate is friends with Imogen Heap and collaborates with Guy Sigsworth on several tracks on MELANKTON. The only minor flaw with the music is that they tend to sound the same, nevertheless I love the album. I find the songs so soothing and relaxing. The one song that really stood out with me is the bonus track "So:Lo" which is a catchy pop number but all of the songs on the album are great. I look forward to hearing more from Kate Havnevik in the near future.

I really wish people would really educate themselves about betta splendens and their housing requirements. These so-called 'betta kits' are not acceptable by any serious aquarist. This tank is clearly too small. A betta fish needs a larger tank that is big enough for a heater to fit inside it. Bettas are tropical fish and they do need a heater to regulate their body temperature and keep them healthy (room temperature water will not help keep a fish heal its fins if it has fin rot or shredded its fins for some other reason). Secondly bettas are intelligent, curious creatures who likes to swim around and through things. This tank does not provide the space for that kind of activiity. With this little prison, er, tank, the fish is just going to sit there and eventually bite its tail due to boredom. If you want to get a betta fish, at least get a medium Kritter Keeper, a mini hyor heater, and a few silk plants and nice bridge for the fish. I wouldn't even use this fish prison for water changes or as a hospital.

I first heard of Leiahdorus on a compilation from A Different Drum records a few years ago. It wasn't until recently when I was given a copy of Parallel Universe did I really start enjoying their brand of synthpop music. When I listen to the music I am often reminded a bit of Owl City, Pet Shop Boys, and even a hint of VNV Nation (like on the opening notes to "When It's Dark I'm Five Again"). I like that Fox Fletcher's guitars do not overwhelm and drown out the crisp synthesized melodies and gentle dance beats. I have to admit Jason Smith's vocals occasionally comes off whiny for me here and there but I quickly get over that and enjoy the music. Overall Parallel Universe is a very good synthpop album. The band really knows how to write a good pop hook as well as lyrics.

VISCERA is my first God Module cd. I recently acquired a copy of it because I was curious to hear their music. It goes without saying VISCERA is one of the best albums in the industrial/EBM genre I have ever heard. God Module successfully weaves addictively infectious pop hooks with their in your face, aggressive industrial beats and vocals. Jasyn Bangert reminded me a lot like Johan from Suicide Commando and Bryan Erickson of Velvet Acid Christ with his distorted vocals. VISCERA starts off with a massive amount of energy with "The Source" and never slows down through out the album. All eleven tracks kicks major tail. They are full of energy and aggression as well as melodies to keep the listener engaged. There is not one single song on the album that I did not like. After hearing VISCERA, I am definitely plan on checking out the band's other albums. They made a new fan out of me.

I'm not really a big fan of pop music. I find most of the genre to be annoying. I will though make the occasional exception like with Kylie Minogue. The first time I heard Kylie was back in the '80s with her dance version of "Locomotion" with was uber cheesy. It wasn't until the late '90s and early '00s did I re-discover her through two dance classics "Light Years" and "Kylie".Personally I prefer "Light Years over "Kylie" simply because I think the material is better. Nevertheless "Kylie" has some really solid pop songs. "Can't Get You Out of My Head" is by far the best track on the album because it is so darn catchy. Even after five years since it was unleashed on to the public, the song still sounds good as ever to me. "Fever" is another great song on the album. It's a bit slower than its predecessor but I like the pop hooks. I am still not big on "Fragile". This is when Kylie's helium-pitched vocals gets on my nerves. I also wasn't really fond of the bonus tracks. I just didn't care much for the melodies. Overall "Kylie" is a great pop album. Too bad her follow up was a real turkey for me.

Nightwish is one of a handful of metal bands that I listen to. I was fortunate to see the band live before the dismissal of Tarja earlier this year. One of my favorite Nightwish albums is "Oceanborn", the band's second album. Their first album felt more like a demo than an actual album. Here on "Oceanborn", the band cleans up on the production. The sound is cleaner but without sounding overly polished. The combination of opera and metal is a match made in heaven. The aggressive guitar riffs compliments Tarja's gorgeous soprano vocals. Neither one overwhelms the other. Every single song on the album is excellent. Not a single dud on this album. "Oceanborn" is about the perfect symphonic metal album for anyone who wants to check out Nightwish.

I have been looking to try to improve the quality of my three Betta fishes' lives. I recently read about Aquari-Sol on the website [...] and how it is used as a preventive measure against parasites and velvet for freshwater fish. I decided to order a bottle for my guys since I can't find it in the major pet store chains that I go to. I have been using 2 to 3 drops per tank for nearly two weeks. I have to say I am starting to see some results with two of my Betta fishes. My poor delta tail Ramses had not long ago started biting his tail and I am positive that was due to parasites. Now that I am using Aquari-Sol with every water change I do, I have noticed that my guy hasn't bitten his tail lately and it has slowly but surely healing nicely. With my red veil tail Anubis, he has been hiding a lot lately and not really active. He also would not come and greet me when I approached his tank for feeding time. Now he does and the little guy is a lot more active now. For freshwater fish owners I say Aquari-Sol is a must have. Just add it with a bit of aquarium salt according to the package and you will have a happy and healthy fish. Mine are certainly happy and healthy :-).

I am a relatively new fan of Cocteau Twins. It wasn't until a few years ago when the band started to remaster and re-release its albums did I get around to checking out their music. "Treasure" was the first Cocteau Twins album I bought. I was immediately hooked on the album's intoxicating ethereal melodies and fragile female vocals of Elizabeth Fraser. There definitely is a post punk edge through out the album that is reminiscent of Siouxsie & The Banshees like on "Persephone". The jagged guitar riffs and Elizabeth's wailing sounded an awfully a lot like Siouxsie & The Banshees and I mean that as a compliment. One of my personal favorite songs is the wistful sounds of "Pandora for Cindy". The song is so light and airy. If clouds could emit a sound or make music, I think this is how they would sound like. My very favorite track on the album has to be "Donimo" based on the gorgeous melodies. Elizbeth Fraser has one of the most original vocals I have ever heard. I like that she uses her vocals as an actual instrument. It really shows through on this album especially on the tracks that are more about vocalizations than lyrics. There is not one single track on "Treasure" I did not like. Every song is great. I feel like I am being transported to another dimension when I listen to this gem of an album. "Treasure" is truly a treasure worth owning.

Last week my new female betta fish Annabelle somehow managed to shred her delicate fins in her balinese lantern (which is rough around the edges). Having heard about API's stress coat, I picked up a bottle from a retail pet store chain. Within a few days, I started noticing some growth in my betta's fins. Clearly the aloe vera was doing its job on my poor girl's shredded fins. Even her missing ventral fin has started growing back. I am definitely pleased with the results that I have seen with this product. Definitely will use this for my bettas if their fins are ever damaged.

I was a huge Corrs fan back in the mid '90s but over the years my taste in music has evolved into more aggressive forms of music. I do though like to take off the edge from the music I regularly listen to every now and then with lighter forms of music. I recently found myself having the urge to listen to The Corrs music. With my cds gone, I decided to pick up the latest best of compilation of their hit songs. Unfortunately the US never caught on to the band's brand of traditional Irish and modern pop/rock music. It is a shame though. I always did enjoy their music up until a couple of albums ago when I found their music completely ditching their Irish roots. "Dreams: The Ultimate Collection" is a fine collection of the band's popular songs. I absolutely the opening track "Goodbye". It is quite catchy in the vein of "Breathless" which is also on this compilation. There are a few songs by the band that I have never been too fond of like "Forgiven Not Forgotten" and "Only When I Sleep". Personally I always felt those songs were devoid of a good melody. All of my favorite songs are on the cd so I can't complain about any song being excluded. Overall "Dreams" is the perfect compilation for casual and new fans.

Of all the albums, cassettes, compact discs that I have owned and loved over the years, one of my top five personal favorite cds of all time is Siouxsie & The Banshees' "Twice Upon a Time: the Singles". I was a freshman in college when I discovered Siouxsie & The Banshees over a decade ago. This was my earliest exposure to goth music. Little did I know was just how big of an impact the tape version of this greatest hits collection would have on me. I was having a horrible time during my freshman year in college. I felt like an outcast and Siouxsie's music came at the perfect time. I was drawn in by the melancholy lyrics and evocative music. I now own this collection on cd and the music still sounds fresh to me. No matter how many times I have listened to it, I still love "Cities in Dust", my favorite Siouxsie song of all time. Gotta love the band's interpretation of The Beatles' "Dear Prudence". All of the songs on the cd is timeless. The production on the cd could use a remastering job but other than that, I love this cd. It is a great representation of the band during the '80s.

As a fan of Seabound, I always wanted to check out Edge of Dawn, the side project of Frank Spinath. In the end I ended up buying THE FLIGHT [LUX] EP. THE FLIGHT consists of 3 new songs and 6 remixes of 3 different tracks. I certainly could hear a bit of Seabound in the beats but the music is darker and harsher especially in Frank's vocals. The title track is a great example of the dark, harsh terroritory Frank and Mario Schumacher goes with Edge of Dawn. There is still quite a bit of synthpop flavor in the songs especially in songs like "Losing Ground" and "Elegance". I don't think Frank wanted to totally alienate any Seabound fans with this group by completely ditching his synthpop roots. The remixes for "Losing Ground", "The Flight [Lux]", and "Descent" were okay but they didn't do much for me. I don't know if it was necessary to include a remix for all three songs. One or two would have been suitable. The music wasn't nearly as melodic as Seabound therefore the cd took a bit of time to grow on me. Still I am glad that I checked out Edge of Dawn's music.

I saw "Innocence: Ghost in the Shell 2" at my local independent movie theatre a couple of years ago. What a treat that was to see an anime film on the big screen. I absolutely loved the vividly colorful film. The animation was absolutely some of the best I have ever seen. What made this film so engrossing for me was the film score by Kenji Kawai. The music. "The Ballad of the Puppets" is my favorite song with the layered vocals and thunderous percussion. Another great track is track #3 with its deep, foreboding electronic beats. I love the jazz-influenced tracks "River of Crystals" and "Follow Me". I thought they were an interesting addition to a soundtrack that is a far cry from the sensuous jazz melodies. Kimiko Itoh has a beautiful voice that could rival any American artist. When I bought "Innocence: Ghost in the Shell 2" two years ago, I bought it as an import and it was not cheap but it was well worth the price I paid for it. This cd remains to be one of my favorite soundtracks in the past five years.

Earlier this summer, I stumbled upon Niyaz's version of The Cure's "Love Song" on Azam Ali's Myspace page. I quickly fell in love with Niyaz's lush interpretation of the classic Cure song. Not long ago I decided to buy the album BACKSPIN: A SIX DEGREES 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY PROJECT. I have to confess that I wasn't really familiar with a lot of the songs that the artists covered except for by the songs Karsh Kale, Niyaz, Jojos de Brujo, and Shrift done. Of the tracks that I wasn't familiar with, my personal favorite is The Real Tuesday Weld's version of ABBA's "The Day Before You Came". I really enjoyed the melodies and the singer's vocals on that song.I also enjoyed Shrift's cover of The Beach Boys' "God Only Knows". I really liked the delicate vocals. Most of the songs were alright but they didn't capture my heart like Niyaz's version of "Love Song" did. I think the reason why I am so blase about the rest of the album is because I am not familiar with a lot of the songs so I couldn't compare them with the original versions. I will say that it is great to hear artists from Six Degrees acknowledge their pop influences by covering a particular song from their favorite pop artist/band.

Delerium is one of my all time favorite bands. I have been a fan for several years now. I must admit their last studio album "Chimera" was far from perfect. There were some good songs but the album wasn't as good as "Karma" and "Poem" were to me. I was a bit nervous about the new album "Nuages du Monde" after my mild disappointment with "Chimera". Thankfully worries were put to rest. I found "Nuages du Monde" to be a real gem. I love the operatic sounds of "Angelicus". Isabel Bayrakdarian has a lovely voice and it matches well with the music. Gotta love Katherine Blake and the gals in Mediaevael Baebes. Their contributions to Delerium's music, past and present, is always a delight to hear. And it is always good to hear the enchanting vocals by Kristy Thirsk and Kirsty Hawkshaw. What would a Delerium cd be without their lovely ethereal voices? I just bought "Nuages du Monde" today and I am already listening to it for the second time which says a lot about what I think of the cd.

Even after a few months, this Elis fan is still reeling over the sudden and untimely death of singer Sabine Dunser. Thank heavens her final work with her band Elis was recorded prior to her death for metal fans to hear. It is almost ironic in a somber way that part of the album title has the word "grief" in it and I am still grieving for the loss of this talented singer."Griefshire" is a 53 minute opus of aggressive yet melodic gothic metal. The album is a perfect follow up to the 2005 release "A Dark Cloud in a Perfect Sky". The music picks up where the previous album left off. Guitarists Pete and Christian Gruber provides the aggressive edge to the music. The guitar riffs never drowns out Sabine's delicate vocals. The rhythm section of Tom Saxer and Max Naescher is steady and reliable to the rest of the band, providing a meaty sound to the band's gothic metal sound. I will admit that the band doesn't offer anything new or adventurous to their sound but then again neither does the legendary hard rock band AC/DC. I enjoyed "Griefshire" with bittersweet tears and immense satisfaction. The ballads on "Griefshire" really moved me the most especially the song "How Long". I thought all of the songs on the cd is classic Elis.The metal has lost a truly lost a talented singer in Sabine Dunser. Sabine had a voice of an angel. Thank heavens I am able to listen to her one more time via "Griefshire". I am pleased that the band has continued to soldier on with a new singer. It will be interesting how well her voice will mesh with the band.

A few weeks ago I discovered the Italian classical band Ashram through one of my social networking sites and immediately fell in love with their music. The band consists of Luigi Rubino on piano, Sergio Panarella on vocals and Alfredo Notarloberti on violin. After listening to several songs online, I found a copy of their album Shining Silver Skies and ordered a copy. The music will take the listener's breathe away. The songs on the album consists of a mixture of with and without vocals. One of my personal favorite tracks is the instrumental "Maria and the Violin's String". Rarely does music move me so deeply to a point of bringing me to tears and this is what that song does to me. The classical instrumental is just hypnotic and relaxing to listen to. I feel like I have heard this song in a movie. Alfredo's skills as a violinist is nothing short of extraordinary. The songs with vocals are just as beautiful. Sergio's vocals has an operatic quality. I can hear it on songs like "Sweet Autumn (part II)" and "Lullaby". I just love Shining Silver Skies and Ashram in general. Ashram's music is so soothing and comforting to listen to. You can find Ashram's cd version of Shining Silver Skies on ebay if you so prefer a hard copy. I definitely recommend checking out this wonderful band.

I can't really say I am a big David Gray fan. I like a few of his songs and that is about it. I decided to check out his most recent studio album LIFE IN SLOW MOTION from the library because I love the country-tinged song "The One I Love". Unlike WHITE LADDERS (the last album I heard by David), there were more songs I didn't care for than ones that I liked. This is not the case here on LIFE IN SLOW MOTION. David's vocals didn't bother me so much since I last heard his music a few years ago. LIFE IN SLOW MOTION is chockful of infectious melodies like on "The One I Love" and "Slow Motion". The only song I wasn't wild about is "Nosda Cariad" but overall I loved LIFE IN MOTION as a whole.I would have given this cd a higher rating but no thanks to Sony freaking Records and their stupid attempt to copy protect their product, I could not listen to LIFE IN SLOW MOTION on my iPod. I was able to load it onto my iTunes and iPod but the music sounded like s**t. Thanks a lot Sony for reminding me why I don't like you and every other major recording label.

Leftfield for some much needed cash. I wish I didn't but I needed the money. Fast forward to 2011. I recently found a cheap copy of Leftism and automatically bought it. I almost forgot how much I had enjoyed this album. I love the diverse sounds on the album. The mix of reggae and techno is pretty original. I personally dug that combination (unlike another reviewer here who clearly was expecting something bland ordinary). As a huge fan of Curve, I love Toni Halliday's vocals on the track "Original". Of course have to love the sing "Open Up" which features Johnny Lydon. Very catchy dance track. It has been years since I have heard Leftism but after all this time, the album still sounds fresh and new to me. It is just a timeless classic which I don't say that every day for techno albums which often becomes dated over time.

I had the immense pleasure of catching the Genitorturers live last month for the very first time. I absolutely hooked by their brand of industrial/metal. While at the show, I bought a copy of Sin City. I have been listening to Sin City day in and day out and haven't gotten sick of listening to the cd. All of the songs are great. They have great pop hooks but still are heavy and aggressive which is how I like my music. The production is not the greatest but I have heard worst production work over the years. Sin City is just a lot of fun to listen to especially at top volume.

I hate admitting this but I am new to Rob Dickinson. Awhile back I discovered a clip on youtube for his song "The End of the World" and fell in love with the song. I recently bought his solo album Fresh Wine for the Horses in which the song can be found on. I bought the 2008 version which features six acoustic versions of Catherine Wheel songs (Rob's former band). I will admit there were a couple of songs on the album that I didn't care for because I did not like the melodies but for the most part I really enjoy the album. I love Rob's distinctive vocals.I enjoyed the second disc as much. The songs has made me curious about Catherine Wheel's music which I regret not ever checking out when the band was still around.

Over ten years ago I made my first cd purchase. It was Loreena McKennitt's "Mask and the Mirror". I first heard of her on one of the local radio stations and immediately fell in love with Loreena's intoxicating vocals. Sixteen years later, I am still a Loreena Mckennitt fan. After the tragic passing of her fiancee in a boating accident, Loreena took several years to grieve and to collect her thoughts. A decade after "Book of Secrets", Loreena finally re-emerges with a new album called "An Ancient Muse".I have to admit "An Ancient Muse" didn't grab me the first time I listened to the cd. It is certainly not as strikingly beautiful as Loreena's previous albums like "The Visit", "Mask and the Mirror", and "Book of Secrets". Now that I am listening to the cd again, the music is starting to grow on me. Loreena may not be treading on any new territory with her music but I am fine with that. The fact that she has put out a new cd in a decade is good enough for me. I equate it to putting on my favorite pair of flannel pajamas, warm and comforting.I wasn't too terribly impressed with the first two tracks "Incantation" and "The Gates of Istanbul". They were pretty average at best. The songs weren't bad just bland. I felt that I had heard them before on Loreena's previous cds. It wasn't until the third track "Caravanserai" did the music start to get my full attention. Overall I enjoyed "An Ancient Muse". The music may not be perfect but I'll take it over the garbage that is popular nowdays. I hope it doesn't take a decade to hear new music from Loreena McKennitt.

I love Putumayo Records and their diverse compilations. I recently picked up a copy of A Native American Odyssey: Inuit to Inca. It did not take me very long to become addicted to the music. I'll admit that collection of songs barely scratches the surface when it comes to Native American music however I think it is a wonderful representation of Native American music to this new listener. I particularly love the song "Qingauiit" by Tudjaat with the gentle rhythms of the percussion and beautiful female vocals. The track "White River Life/Dine/USA" by Burning Sky. While the music is clearly modern, the lyrics certainly is pure Native American. Another personal favorite track is "Nendaa-Go Back" by Jerry Alfred & The Medicine Beat. I love the melodies and the harmonies on this particular song. There is not one song on the entire compilation I did not enjoy. I find it very soothing and relaxing to listen to at any time of day.

I first came across CLUB BIZARRE on another website and bought a more affordable copy of it. The two cd compilation is a mixed cd of some of today's popoular industrial and a few synthpop bands. I have heard of most of the bands featured on the album but there are a few that I have not heard before like Dulce Liquido, P.A.L and Akanoid. For the most part I enjoyed the compilation but there were some songs I wasn't really crazy about. I could not get into the noisier industrial tracks by the likes of Noisex, Dive, and Akanoid. I found those particular tracks to be monotonous to listen to. One of my personal favorite songs on the cd is L'ame Immortelle's "At the End". The melodies and Sonya's vocals are pure bliss for me to listen to. It has quickly become one of my favorite L'ame Immortelle songs of all time. I also loved the songs by And One, Covenant, and Funker Vogt. Disc 2 has some pretty good songs as well by the likes of VNV Nation, Claire Voyant, Ravenous, Assemblage 23, and The Dust of Basement. What I didn't really like about the entire compilation is the shoddy production value. While I have heard worse, the sound quality on the album is anything but good. I wish it was better but that is out of my control. All in all CLUB BIZARRE Vol. 1 isn't too bad. While it could have been better, it is still an interesting compilation worth recommending for fans of synthpop and industrial music.

I am not familiar with Chantal Kreviazuk's music. I prefer listening to goth and industrial music for most of the time but every now and then I like to listen to singer/songwriters like Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan. I recently came across Chantal Kreviazuk's latest album "Ghost Stories" (she obviously aped that title from British singer/songwriter Amanda Ghost) at my local library. I decided to check out her music. I have to admit that I found her cd to be quite pleasant to listen to. The songs have a good pop hook but I also found her music rather bland and uninspiring to listen to. I wasn't too wild about Chantal's voice either. Her voice got on my nevers quite a bit like on "Blame Yourself" which she sounded awfully whiney. I could hear an obvious Sheryl Crow influence in Chantal's voice and I can't say that is a good thing either. "Ghost Stories" is pleasant to listen to but offers nothing that hasn't been said and done before by other female singer/songwriters.

Alright I admit, I like the film score to TITANIC, a movie that makes me violently ill (despite Kate Winslet being in the film)or puts me into a diabetic coma from the sugary storyline. James Horner's classical film score is quite effective in drawing in the audience with his often emotional music. "Rose" is the perfect example. Sissel's delicate vocals is never overwhelming and never the center point of the song. The focus is the melody. Unfortunately what drags down this soundtrack is that insidious ballad "My Heart Will Go On" that was played like every ten minutes on the radio back in 1997 to ad nauseum. I think the song would have sounded much better with Scandinavian artist Sissel. The problem with "My Heart Will Go On" is Celine Dion and her awful vocal acrobatics. It reminds me of Whitney Houston on that awful Dolly Parton remake "I Will Always Love You". Both women tries way too hard to prove to the audience that they can sing but what they get is they sound like a foghorn,loud and obnoxious. Plus the whole atmospheric mood of the film score is totally ruined by that buzzkill Celine Dion's caterwaulering. Despite the awfulness of the film and Celine Dion's screeching, I do like James Horner's score for TITANIC. It is very relaxing to listen to after a long day at the office.

As a child I always been fascinated by Japan. I always loved Japanese culture from its rich history to its tapestry of fashion,pop culture, and its people including geishas. My interest in geishas really didn't hit its peak until I read Arthur Golden's novel "Memoirs of a Geisha". After the novel, I went out and bought or checked out any and every book about geishas.I finally got around to checking out the John Gallagher coffee table book on geishas "Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art". I personally enjoyed reading this book and looking at the gorgeous pictures. I loved the illustrations that dissected the geisha's wardrobe and makeup. I found the book pretty informative but there were times when I felt like the author was straying away from the topic of geishas and more into Japanese history. Was it really that necessary to go into the Heian and Edo periods? The author also does a bit of name checking but never get the people he name checks to say anything in his book. Liza Dalby gets a brief mention and that is about it. If anything Liza is the go to expert on geishas, not John Gallagher who I suspect is more familiar with Japanese history than with geishas. If John really knew a lot about geishas, why on earth did he use a lot photos of tourists dressed up as maikos? Think about it.For a reference book on geishas, John Gallagher's book sure as heck isn't it. Go read Liza Dalby's "Geisha". For beautiful color photos, "Geisha: a Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art" is the book for you.

Last weekend I went to see the bio-pic THE RUNAWAYS at my local Landmark theater. I was memorized by the story of the '70s hard rock band The Runaways. When I left the theater, I walked away as a fan of the band. To get a general idea of the band's music, I downloaded the 20th Century Masters collection of The Runaways' music. I must say I have been enjoying the collection immensely. The songs are catchy yet aggressive courtesy of Joan Jett and Lita Ford's guitar riffs. My personal favorite songs right now are "Cherry Bomb" and "Queens of Noise". While the ballads aren't too bad, I think the band sounds the best when they are in full rock mode. The production on the collection may not be the best but I have heard worse. My intentions was to expose myself to the original Runaways songs after I had seen the film. This collection is a good introduction for this new fan.

"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is one of my favorite films to come out in the past several years. To be honest, I would have preferred to hear more of Jon Brion's original music. Jon's theme song is a perfect example. I just love the theme song. It was a great opener. Jon's film score is subtle and never manipulatively over dramatic like those by Hans Zimmer and John Williams. The inclusion of Lata Mangeshkar's "Wada No Tod" seemed to be questionable. The song sounded so out of place on an album that consisted of past and present artists and a bunch of instrumentals. I did love both songs by The Polyphonic Spree. Those songs are very catchy and playful. I even enjoyed the song by Beck an artist I find grossly overrated. The two songs by The Willowz were absolutely unnecessary. They are one of the most untalented bands I have ever heard. "Eternal Sunshine..." is a good soundtrack but not the best I have heard.

I must confess I only acquired the Tyler Bates film score to 300 because of Azam Ali, one of my favorite singers in recent years. I was rather surprised by how in your face Tyler's film score was (have yet to see the movie, my bad :p). Tyler's music relies heavily on percussion with minimal use of an stringed instruments. There isn't a whole lot of melody in a lot of the songs. From what little I have seen of the film, the loud, bombastic score is appropriate considering the violent nature of the film. Thankfully there are moments when the bombastic music is turned down a few notches like on the haunting "What Must a King do?" and "No Sleep Tonight". That track is definitely reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's work on the GLADIATOR film score. I must say that the song "No Sleep Tonight" was too eerily like what I heard on GLADIATOR. I definitely can see why people would accuse Tyler of being a plagurist. Azam Aliz does an uncanny impersonation of Lisa Gerrard on this track. The similiarities between her and Lisa Gerrard's vocals from the GLADIATOR soundtrack is uncanny. I can only listen to 300 in small doses. I find a lot of the music too obnoxious for my taste. While I did like "No Sleep Tonight" and "What Must a King Do?", I wished that Tyler Bates would have gotten an imagination and tried to create music that was not a dead on impersonation of the work that can be heard on GLADIATOR.

Listening to Sarah McLachlan's music is the equivalent to drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter night in your favorite pajamas and all snuggled up on the couch with a good book or movie. Sarah's music shares that same comfortable feel. After a few years on a hiatus since "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" (live cds don't count since the most, if not all of the material was previously released), "Afterglow" was the long awaited follow up to "Surface". The music picks up where "Surface" left off. The music is piano based unlike her first two albums which were sparse acoustic albums. Despite the overpolished sound, I still love listening to "Afterglow". I just love Sarah's gentle vocals and lush piano melodies. The lyrics tend to be a bit on the drippy side which makes for good fodder for sad scenes on soap operas or other tv dramas. Nevertheless Sarah McLachlan's music does resonate with the human spirit. My favorite tracks on the album has to be "Time" and "Perfect Girl". The combination of the lyrics and melodies were spot on. It is always nice to take a breather from all the dark, aggressive music and throw in Sarah McLachlan's music into my stereo from time to time.

Fish keeping is probably one of the most, if not the misunderstood hobbies out there. Part of the problem is bad information and inappropriate housing for fishes like this half gallon fish bowl. Goldfish are a lot more difficult than what a lot of people would know, I should know from personal experience. Goldfish requires to be in at least 20 gallon tanks with powerful filters. Since they are social animals, I would recommend a 55 gallon tank for about 3-5 goldfish. With bettas, they require to be in heated fish tanks. They are tropical fish that originated in Thailand. They are used to warm waters of 75 to 80 degrees. I know what I am talking about. I have done plenty of research on bettas. For those who think I am wrong about bettas needing to be in heated tanks, please go google betta fish forums and ask people. Experienced hobbyists will tell you that bettas do need heaters in their tanks (not unless you live in Thailand or somewhere in Indonesia). There is no way one can heat a half gallon bowl without overheating the water and killing the fish. A 2.5 gallon Kritter Keeper is a good alternative or a new, unused 5 gallon plastic tub from Target. Both can be heated properly and they aren't very expensive either. The only thing I could think of using this half gallon bowl is as a nano tank, a planted tank but do not put any fish or snails in it. I definitely can not nor will not recommend this 1/2 gallon bowl for new fish owners. The life span of your fish will greatly diminish because of their physical needs. Please do your research before you spend your money on cheap products like this bowl here.

I can't say that I am a fan of the country music genre but at the same time I can't pretend that there aren't a few artists in the genre that I listen to. After listening to the Dixie Chicks's last album TAKING THE LONG WAY, I was surprised by how much I liked it (despite not liking a few of the songs). I recently decided to check out the band's first album WIDE OPEN SPACES on a whim. While there were quite a few songs on the album that I did not like (for example the first two songs on the album, there were still quite a few songs that I did enjoy listening to. I am particularly fond of the ballads like "Loving Arms", and "You Were Mine", and the hopelessly infectious first single "There's Your Trouble". The biggest flaw with the Chicks' music is Natalie Maines' vocals. It sometimes comes off as a bit screechy for my liking so I can only take her voice in small doses if I am not in a good mood. On the ballads, her voice is more tolerable. I think that is her biggest strength. I really enjoy it when Natalie harmonizes with Emily and Martie. Despite not liking a few of the songs here, I still like WIDE OPEN SPACES.

Ever since I have re-discovered Nena last month with her 2003's 20 Jahre (Revised) collection, I have been on a quest to find her music either at any of my local record stores or online. I recently bought her Definitive Collection a few weekends ago. I really wanted to hear the original versions of the songs on 20 Jahre so this was the ideal compilation for me. Definitive Collection is an enjoyable collection of Nena's pop hits. It is a shame that she was totally written off by America as a one hit wonder. I find myself enjoying her music immensely. Her music is loaded with catchy pop hooks like "Leuchtturm", "Irgendwie, Irgendwo, Irgendwann", and of course "99 Luftballoons". As much as I enjoy this collection, I felt the compilation dragged on a little too much. I think a few songs could have or should have been left off like the dreadful "Bongo Girl" and the mediocre "Tokyo".

I really can't say I am a diehard Stevie Nicks fan but I always have enjoyed a good number of her popular hits (with and without Fleetwood Mac). Her best of collection CRYSTAL VISIONS is perfect for casual listeners like msyelf. The cd contains all of my favorite songs that Stevie has done in the past and present. My personal favorite songs? "Room on Fire" and "Talk to Me" (which goth band Diva Destruction does a spectacular cover for the indie film GYPSY 83). I never really was crazy about Fleetwood Mac's music but in this case I really enjoyed songs like "Silver Springs" and "Landslide".In this day and age of Hannah Montana, The Pussycat Dolls, and other disposable pop tarts who tries to pass themselves off as singers, it is refreshing to hear Stevie Nicks. In my opinion, Stevie sounds as good as ever with her distinct raspy vocals which I absolutely adore. She can definitely teach the latest pop du jour on a thing or two about singing and maintaining a career that has gone on for more than the proverbial 15 minutes. CRYSTAL VISIONS is a great testament to Stevie's longevity in an industry that is more concerned with the bottom line than creating long-lasting careers for artists.

I first discovered Goldfrapp six, seven years ago on a now defunct music cable show. My curiousity was immediately piqued when I heard the beautiful melodies coupled with Allison Goldfrapp's fragile vocals. As much as I like Goldfrapp's current music, FELT MOUNTAIN remains my personal favorite Goldfrapp album of all time. The music is a mix of trip hop, classical, and jazz music. FELT MOUNTAIN sounds like it is the film score to an early James Bond film. One of my favorite songs on the album is "Human". It would be impossible to not hear the Shirley Bassey comparison in Allison's vocals on this particular track. Allison does a superior job over Amy Winehouse when it comes to channeling Shirley Bassey. Another favorite track is "Paper Bag" with the sparse melodies and Allison's delicate vocals. I like how subtle the trip hop beats are subtle and never takes over the song through out the entire album. Will Gregory allows Allison's vocals to take front and center. Unlike a lot of pop singers today, Allison never pounds the listener with her vocals. I can't believe it has been eight years since FELT MOUNTAIN has come out. The music still sounds fresh and new as the first time I listened to the album several years ago.

I am a big fan of Celtic Woman. I was introduced to the women thanks to my local PBS station that aired their first televised special just over a year ago. "A New Journey" is music from their latest dvd of the same name. I caught a televised airing on it last month on my PBS station so I knew what to expect on their cd. Hayley Westenra joins Celtic Woman and she is a nice addition to the group. Her voice is somewhere between Chloe's and Lisa. I have to admit that the music took me awhile to grow on. The songs didn't leave me breathless like their self-titled album did but after a few hundred listens, I was ready for some new music. There are a couple of songs on the album that the women sing without the orchestra, "Over the Rainbow" and "Beyond the Sea" (well for the most part). I wasn't really big on hearing the women sing acapella but it wasn't bad. Just different. One of my favorite songs on the cd is "The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun" (all five women sings on the song), it is kinda bombastic but it is a perfect opener for the cd. My other favorite song is the beautiful "Caledonia" which is sung by Lisa Kelly. That song stood out for me on this cd as did "Someday" did on their self-titled album. I also enjoyed "Vivaldi's Rain". I thought it was odd hearing lyrics to the song but still lovely song. The production is slick. Melodies are lush. Nothing new or innovative but I still enjoyed listening to "A New Journey". Overall "A New Journey" is definitely worth having for Celtic Woman fans.

I am relatively new to Velvet Acid Christ's music so I can't pretend to be an expert on their music. I recently acquired the new VAC album "Lust for Blood". I was not disappointed to say the very least. "Lust for Blood" has all the elements in electro/industrial music that I like. Normally I do not enjoy distorted vocals but in this case, I liked the distorted vocals. The only negative thing about the distorted vocals that I couldn't understand what Bryan Erickson was singing about without looking at the cd booklet. I especially loved the instrumental tracks which were quite beautiful, a far contrast from the harsh distorted beats of the other songs. I wasn't too impressed with VAC's previous studio effort "Hex Angel". It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either. The music didn't really capture the essence of Velvet Acid Christ like their previous albums and now "Lust for Blood". The lyrics may be cheesy but at least Bryan Erickson doesn't take himself too seriously with his music like a lot of industrial bands do.

I have to confess I am not all familiar with All About Eve. I came across Fairy Light Nights 2 at my local record store last year. I finally decided to get it on a whim because I always saw it in the cd bins collecting dust (literally). I am so glad that I did. I felt like I was in the audience throughout the album. The music takes front and center stage. The noise from the audience is minium. Production is minimum at best. I love the music. The songs are short and sweet. I felt like I was listening to The Church but with female vocals. After hearing this album, I definitely plan on getting the first volume as well as the band's other albums (or at least try to). I wish I discovered the band sooner though.

I'm a new fan to Andre Rieu. I didn't start getting into his music until I caught his Christmas special on my local PBS station last year. I found his performances highly energetic and playful which is rare in this often serious musical genre. After catching a repeat performance of "Tuscany", I decided to make the cd version my next Andre Rieu purchase. Whenever I listen to "Tuscany", I can easily see Andre Rieu performing with his orchestra. His skills as a violinist is exquisite. He is very subtle and is never out of tune. "Tuscany" begins with three of the most beautiful classical numbers I have ever heard. The beautiful orchestral melodies puts me at ease. I wished that the cd included "The Rose" (the Bette Midler tune) that can be seen on the dvd. I loved the operatic version. It would have been a nice addition to the cd. Of all the operatic numbers my favorite has to be "Ode to Joy". I have to admit though the singers have a terrible tendency to caterwaul on the songs which can be quite disconcerting for these ears. On the other hand the same can be said about a lot of opera singers as well as modern pop singers. There wasn't a single song on the cd that I didn't enjoy listening to. Andre Rieu's love for music really does shine through his music here. I hope some day I will have the opportunity to see him perform live. I don't think nothing can compare to seeing this talented artist live. Until then his cds will do nicely.

I never thought I would ever be disappointed in a Leaves' Eyes release but Hades has truly frozen over because I have finally heard a Leaves' Eyes cd that left me unimpressed. I recently acquired "Legend Land" yesterday when I went cd hunting. It hurts me to say this since I am a big Leaves' Eyes fan but "Legend Land" did not do squat for me. The music was nowhere as epic sounding or melodic as "Lovelorn" or "Vinland Saga". While I didn't mind Alexander Krull's vocals so much on "Vinland Saga", I absolutely hated his vocals on this 21 minute EP. His cookie monster on acid vocals was absolutely distracting. The one song that I did love on the whole EP was the title track. Liv Kristine sounded like an angel. Too bad I can't say the same about the other tunes which were lifeless and flat IMO. Hopefully this isn't what is to be expected for the band's next full length album.

A few weeks ago I was perusing the used cd bins at a local independent record store when I came across Faith and the Muse's "Annwyn, Beneath the Waves". I am not really familiar with the band except for one other album "The Burning Season" (and I liked what I heard). I thought this would be a good time to become a little more familiar with the group's music and I bought the cd.I have to admit that the music took some time to grow on me. I had to listen to "Annwyn, Beneath the Waves" a few more times for the music to sink into my subconsciousness. It is difficult to peg down Faith and the Muse's sound. Their sound on the album ranges from goth to medieval folk music. I like that their sound isn't easy to categorize. There are times when I am reminded of my favorite bands like Mediaeval Babes, Siouxsie & The Banshees and Clan of Xymox. I also enjoyed the mediaeval folk influences that permeates the entire album. It adds a distinct flavor to the songs.I'm glad I bought "Annwyn, Beneath the Waves". I found the music enchanting to listen to :).

Just kidding ;). KMFDM does not suck. They are easily one of my all time favorite industrial bands. For a long time, the band's catalog from the past decade had been out of print. Last year Sascha Konietzko finally was able to obtain the rights to the band's earlier albums and began to remaster and re-release them through KMFDM's own record label and Metropolis Records. One of the first handful of albums that released last year was the classic ANGST. Without a shadow of a doubt, the album sounds a hundred percent better than the 1994 version. The production on the original album is awful in comparison to the remastered version. The music sounds fresh as ever, never sounds dated or obsolete. Considering the current state of the world, ANGST captures the discontent that many Americans are feeling with its politically charged lyrics. The music itself is as abrasive as the lyrics with its searing guitar riffs and club friendly dance beats. I am glad that Sascha went through the painstaking task of remastering and re-releasing the band's earlier albums. They deserved it and to be heard all over again.

Of all the industrial bands that I have been listening to on a regular basis for the last several years now, KMFDM is the industrial band I have been into for the longest time. NIHIL is easily my favorite KMFDM album (w/Raymond Watts). The first song I have ever heard by KMFDM is the popular single "Juke Joint Jezebel" back in 1997. A few years later I finally bought the album NIHIL which included the song. I recently scquired a copy of the newly remastered version of NIHIL. This new version sounds a hundred times better than the original version.The music on NIHIL sounds as fresh to me as the first time I had heard it in 1999. The only difference is that this album was given a proper remastering treatment. NIHIL is flawless to me. Songs like "Search & Destroy" and "Brute" are brutal and aggressive, the way I like my industrial music. The inclusion of a horn section on "Disobedience" is brilliant on Sascha's part. Industrial music is the last place you would hear a horn section on but it works here on the song. The last track on the cd is a bonus instrumental track simply called "Nihil" which wasn't on the original version. It is a nice way to close out one of my personal favorite KMFDM cds. I strongly recommend for any industrial fan who wants to check out early KMFDM to check out the newly remastered NIHIL. This is why I love this genre and KMFDM.

I really don't care much for pop music, much less latin pop music when that crossover explosion happened (which I completely blame on Ricky Martin for creating) but I'll make an exception with Shakira's "Laundry Service". The first time I actually heard her music was when the music video for "Whatever, Whenever" came out six years ago. The song was pure ear candy with its infectious pop hooks. So I eventually bought Shakira's "Laundry Service". Much to my surprise I actually enjoyed the cd. The music is filled with catchy pop/rock hooks without being overly polished. I think the songwriting is kinda weak and at times silly. I thought Shakira sounds the best singing in her native tongue than in english but that's just me. Another flaw is Shakira's vocals which is somewhat shrill at times but otherwise this album is a fun, guilty pleasure of mine.

After almost a month since I submitted an order, I finally received my copy of Cinderella Effect's Pearl cd today in the mail. Cinderella Effect is the side project for Blutengel singer Constance Rudert. She is accompanied by two other women, Katja Gutowski and Coralie Thomas. Pearl is the debut album by Cinderella Effect. Most of the songs are cover songs but they are re-interpretated in a more classical manner than simply re-vamping the song with a different singer. The instrumental intro and outro are the only original tracks by Cinderella Effect. The rest of the songs are gothic and modern rock classics like Siouxsie & The Banshee's "Israel" and The Cranberries' "Zombie". Being a massive VNV Nation fan that I am, Cinderella Effect's interpretation of "Standing" really stood out the most on the album. The song is so beautiful with Constance's polished pop vocals and delicate piano melodies. I love how the song begins as a ballad and slowly builds up as a midtempo dance song. The emotional lyrics and her lovely vocals mixed really well. I found myself hitting the repeat button to hear this song over and over again. Another great cover is Soundgarden's "Black Hole Sun" which has a jazz flavor in the vein of Peggy Lee's classic "Fever". This version is very sultry and will seduce the listener right away. Yes this album is pricey but the music makes Pearl worth listening to. Every single track on the album is excellent. I can certainly hear a hint of Tori Amos in both Constance's vocals as well as in the piano playing. It is nice to hear Constance Rudert take front and center as a singer as opposed to back up vocalist in her other band Blutengel. "Pearl" may be pricey but it sure as heck worth the money. I think I found my #1 album of 2006 for my best of list I will be posting here sometime this month.Track list:01. Intro02. After Dark03. Standing04. Wenn de Liebe ein Engel ist05.

I love Enigma. I love to chill out on a cold winter's night with a cup of hot chocolate and an Enigma cd. I've been an Enigma fan for several years now. I have to admit I wasn't all that fond of Enigma's last album "Voyageur". While I have to give credit to Michael Cretu from branching out from his traditional sound of ambient/pop music, the songs unfortunately didn't resonate with me like his previous albums did. I was a bit wary of "A Posteriori" but thankfully I was wrong. "A Posteriori" is certainly not like his first two albums but it certainly is not "Voyageur" part two. I thought the music shared all the elements of Enigma's past and present music. I was rather disappointed that Ruth-Ann and Sandra Cretu didn't contribute their enchanting vocals to "A Posteriori". The woman Michael got to sing on the album was quite good though. I enjoyed her vocals quite a bit.Nothing will ever beat Enigma's earlier albums but "A Posteriori" certainly makes up for "Voyageur" in my book.

Awhile back I was perusing youtube when I came across Tristesse de la Lune. I was immediately hooked by their brand of electropop so I ended up buying online a copy of A Heart Whose Love is Innocent thanks to the songs "Die Andere In Dir" and "Queen of the Damned". The album is 50 minutes plus some of catchy electropop eerily similar to Blutengel. Ironically Gini and Kati had sung on a few Blutengel tracks in the past. I just love the women's vocals, lush melodies and gentle throbbing of the dance beats. I enjoy listening to all the songs on the album. I think this album is worth checking out especially if you enjoy Blutengel.

"Grizzly Man" is a fascinating documentary on the self-proclaimed Grizzly Bear expert Timothy Treadwell. A few years ago Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were killed and eaten by grizzly bear in Alaska. "Grizzly Man" focuses on the life of Timothy Treadwell through his friends. After all, this film is called "Grizzly Man", not "Grizzly Bear". According to the film, Timothy Treadwell did not have his marbles altogether. Not only was he a recovering alcoholic but he was clinically depressed, coupled with his love for the grizzly bears, the combination was self-destructive. Another problem with Timothy was his enormous ego and desire to be famous and it shows in the documentary. He constantly puts himself in danger by invading the bear's personal space. He also put his girlfriend in danger as well. It annoyed me to no ends of the earth seeing how Timothy treated the local wildlife in Alaska. He treated them as cartoon characters than as dangerous wild animals. Yogi and Boo Boo these bears were not. The most annoying thing about the documentary was Werner Herzog's condescending narration. There were moments during the film when I had to fast forward through the movie or hit the mute button because Werner's narration was atrocious. Werner should have had one of Tim's friends narrate the film. I definitely do not think that Timothy didn't deserve to be killed the way that he was like one helicopter pilot said but I will say that his recklessness and ignorance was to blame. Amie certainly didn't have to die either. She was an innocent bystander in this whole tragedy. Timothy should have been more considerate to her fear of bears when he was studying them. One of my favorite moments during the film was towards the end when Timothy just lost it on camera which obviously wasn't meant to be seen by anyone. That was pure comedy gold. Good documentary, too bad the narration was awful.

I admit I absolutely hated "The Village". The film started out rather good. The build up in suspense was flawlessly executed but then the second half of the film totally went downhill for me. One of the few things I enjoyed about "The Village" is the film score by James Newton Howard. The combination of the orchestral film score and dark cinematography was perfect. Both complimented each other. Violinist Hilary Hahn was what really gravitated me to the music. A lot of film scores have a terrible tendency to be loud and bombastic (like John Williams and Hans Zimmer) but James Howard Newton's score is subtle and never overwhelming to a person's ears.

I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of U2. I fail to see the hoopla over one of the most overrated bands in the past two decades. I will admit that the band has put out some good songs over the years. J218 is perfect for casual listeners of U2 like myself. All of my favorite U2 songs are from the 1980s. Songs like "Without or Without You" and "Sunday Bloody Sunday" still sounds amazingly fresh and never dated. I can never get tired of listening to the band's songs from the '80s. The '90s and'00s is another story. The only songs I did like from the past decade is "One", "Walk On" and "Stuck in a Moment". Everything else was rubbish for me. I make no apologies when I say that I hated the song the band did with Green Day "The Saints Are Coming". What a horrid track. I'm glad I didn't pay anything for this cd which contains too much filler songs for my liking.

For a long time, I have been wanting to check out And One's music but kept on putting off. I saw them live last year on the VNV Nation tour and loved their brand of synthpop. I finally got around this past weekendto buying their last full-length album BODYPOP. I have not been able to stop listening to the cd. The music is pure ear candy to this synthpop fan. I love how Steve Naghavi croons. His voice is deep but not like Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode or even Steffan of De/vision. Steve definitely has a distinct voice of his own. The music itself is a lot of fun to dance to. Songs like "Military Fashion Show", "So Klingt Liebe", and "Stand the Pain" has a ton of energy that will make any wallflower want to hit the dancefloor. Of course there is the occasional ballad. I particularly am fond of "The Dream". I particularly enjoyed the crisp synthesized melodies and gentle dance beats. I wish the cd was a bit longer but otherwise there is nothing about BODYPOP that I didn't like. Great album. I am definitely an And One fan for sure now.

I think it was Spin magazine that aroused my curiousity towards Natasha Khan (aka Bat for Lashes). I was fortunate to have found a copy of FUR & GOLD at my library. The firt thing that I noticed when I first listened to FUR & GOLD is the Bjork comparison. Natasha's vocals. I liked what I heard but the songs didn't really start growing on me until I had listened to the cd several times. Now I have come to really love the cd. I am reminded of both Bjork, Kate Bush, and a smidgeon of Tori Amos (at least the music aspect). I have always loved the delicate sounds of the harpsichord so to hear that on a song like "Horse and I" is a real treat for me. You really don't hear harpsichord in modern music nowadays. Overall FUR & GOLD is a wonderful album to kick back and relax to.

Not long ago I was perusing Youtube when I came across Joan Jett's version of the AC/DC classic "Dirty Deeds". I'm really wary of other artists covering songs by AC/DC or any band as popular as AC/DC but Joan really pulls it off in my honest opinion. After discovering Joan's version of "Dirty Deeds", I found her version of the CCR classic "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?". I too immediately fell in love with the song. That was the clincher that I needed to buy The Hit List. I quickly got a copy of Joan Jett's cover album The Hit List. For the most part, I really enjoyed The Hit List. I personally thought Joan and the Blackhearts did a great job on the songs. The only song I do not care for is "Up from the Skies". Even Joan could not make that song sound good. I just did not care for the melodies but otherwise I loved the other songs.

Like a lot of Americans, I first heard of Nena back in the 1980s with her smash hit "99 Luftballons". I was just a child at the time and was more into other artists in the new wave genre. 20 some years later I have re-discovered Nena courtesy of a duet she does with ex-Wolfsheim vocalist Peter Heppner for an upcoming greatest hits collection. So I started checking more into Nena's more recent music online and almost immediately fell in love with her music. One of the songs was her collaboration with another '80s icon Kim Wilde on "Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime". Of course I had to get the album that song was on because I just loved the duet between the two women. I knew right from the title of the album that the versions of Nena's hits were revised. I have to admit I wasn't sure of what to make of the updated version of "99 Luftballoons" but I now have come to enjoy it as much as the original version. The rest of the album was a real joy to listen to. The songs are really infectious, just awesome pop songs. I may not know a lick of German but I don't mind. I enjoyed how Nena incorporated a bit of jazz and rock on her songs which I think helped keep her songs sounds fresh and never dated. It is too bad America couldn't get past "99 Luftballoons" because they sure missed out on a talented artist who looks and sounds amazing after all these years.

Earlier this summer, I caught a segment on the CBS SUNDAY MORNING SHOW with singer/songwriter Regina Spektor. My curiousity was piqued when I heard bits of her music. I found a copy of her cd at my library and checked it out. The firs thing that came to my mind when I listened to her cd BEGIN TO HOPE is that she reminded me of Fiona Apple and Lily Allen. Vocally Regina often reminded me of Fiona but with the quirky sense of humor of Britsh pop star Lily Allen.BEGIN TO HOPE took a few listens for the music to grow on me. My personal favorite track is "Better". The pop hooks and Regina's vocals sounded the best for me on this track. I also enjoyed "Samson" a lot too. I liked how intimate the song sounded. I felt like I was watching Regina perform in a smokey coffeehouse in New York City. I really like this stripped down sound. I think Regina sounds the best when it is just her and her piano. I love the playful melodies and rhythms of "On the Radio". Very catchy and upbeat.My only quibble with BEGIN TO HOPE is repetition. I felt that Regina didn't put in lot of effort to give a lot of her songs their own individual songs. Some of the songs sounded too much a like to me. For all its foibles though, BEGIN TO HOPE shows the potential Regina has as an artist. I hope that she is one of the lucky artists who will still have a career in 10-20 years down the road.

Back in my college days, I was a staunch supporter of the whole grassroots/DIY music scene. One of my favorite artists in this scene was Ani Difranco. I had read quite a bit about her and on a whim decided to check out her music. Unfortunately my taste in music changed over the years and my interest in Ani waned. Recently I tried listening her recent albums but I couldn't get into them. I was very pleased to see that she had finally put out a two disc greatest hits compilation called CANON. CANON did not disappoint me. It was a nice reminder to what made me fall in love with Ani's music. Between the two discs, disc one is my favorite because they contain all of my favorite Ani Difranco songs like "Little Plastic Castle" and "You Had Time". I couldn't get into disc 2 since I am not a huge fan of Ani's more recent material. I thought it was interesting that Ani would re-record a few of her classic songs on both discs. Most of them I didn't mind but I wasn't particularly fon do the re-recorded version of "Both Hands". I think the original version was perfect in every sense of the world. All in all, I think CANON is a good introduction to new Ani Difranco fans as well as a refresher course for old fans like myself.

I am not the massive fan of Moby's music as I once was back in the late '90s and early '00s. I used to own most of his cds but eventually my taste in music changed and I sold my Moby cds. I decided to check out Moby's best of compilation GO: THE VERY BEST OF MOBY after I had a craving for his music. There are two discs, disc one consists of the original tracks and disc two consists of remixes. I found the remix disc absolute rubbish and boring beyond belief. It was so not necessary to include a remix disc in my personal opinion. I am just content with disc one. Since I hadn't heard Moby's last studio cd HOTEL, the songs from that album were new to me. I especially loved "Dream About Me" w/Laura Dawn on vocals. The song is so addictively catchy. Laura's delicate vocals is another reason why I love the song. I am so glad Moby didn't include that rancid version of "South Side" with Gwen Stefani on vocals. Gwen Stefani can't sing period and she totally ruined that song for me when that new version of "South Side" came out. I wasn't too big on the 2006 version of "Go". I prefer the original version. I love Debbie Harry but her voice totally ruined the song "New York, New York". I wish Moby found someone else to sing vocals. As overplayed "Porcelain" was, I still love that song and all the singles from PLAY (as well as 18). GO: THE VERY BEST OF MOBY is a good compilation for casual fans like me.

Words really can't describe how I feel about this awful product. First of all, bettas requires air to breathe. Having a plant in the bowl takes up too much surface space for the little guy or gal. Secondly 3/4 gallon is completely inappropriate. Bettas are tropical fish who requires to be in heated water with temperatures ranging from 75 to 80 degrees. There is no room for even a Hydor 7.5W mini heater. Third, ammonia can easily build up within a few hours. Bettas are sensitive fish who requires in pristine water. You would have to be changing his or her water like 2-3 times a day. Yes it may be stressful but eventually the fish will settle down. I would rather have a stressed yet healthy fish in clean water than a happy yet unhealthy fish in dirty water. Long story short, don't buy this item or anything that is this size of a bowl. In the end, the fish ends up paying for its owner's ignorance.

I rarely read a book in one day but I just did with Jon Krakauer's book INTO THE WILD, the true life story of Christopher McCandless. I had the immense pleasure of seeing the film last weekend. The next logical step for me was to read the book the film was based on.By now most people know the story about Christopher McCandless (aka Alexander Supertramp). Christopher was a young man in his early 20s who had just graduated from Emory University. He grew up in a well to do family. You would think that anyone with Christopher's background would be content and happy but not Christopher. He deplored wealth and materialism. After college, Christopher severed all contact with his family including his sister Carine who he was most close to, and set off on his own spiritual journey across the country. He donated the remaining money in his trust fund account to charity and destroyed every vestigage of his identity as Christopher McCandless. As his cocky alter ego Alexander Supertramp, Christopher traveled around the US and eventually to Alaska. Along the way he met a slew of colorful characters. Unfortunately his cockiness and lack of experience in the harsh wilderness of Alaska proved to be his downfall.Journalist Jon Krakauer explores Christopher's travels through various writings and conversations with his family as well as friends. I enjoyed reading Jon's investigation into Christopher's life and adventures. He does a great job at dissecting Christopher as a human being as well as the decisions he had made through out his short life. While I do think Christopher was foolish and arrogant to not come prepared to live in Alaska, the quick dismissal of him as a loon is an insult to McCandless' family. The man is dead and his family will never see him again. I think that alone is cruel enough.My only beef with this book is the two chapters that focuses on the author's desires to climb Devil's Thumb. I know Jon was only trying to place himself in Christopher's shoes but two chapters? I think that should have been whittled down to a chapter, or better yet a page or two. Other than that, I loved INTO THE WILD. It is not very often do I come across a book that will make me want to step away from the computer or tv and just sit back and spend the entire day reading.

This weekend I was looking for some Christmas music to add to my iTunes library when I came across Nettwerk's MAYBE THIS CHRISTMAS TREE, a collection of Xmas music by a group of indie pop bands like Death Cab for Cutie and Pedro the Lion. I was intrigued and I checked out the cd. I have to say that this is one of the better modern Christmas compilations I have heard. There are not a lot of Christmas cds from the alternative genre that I find enjoyable. I like how every artist on the cd gave their song its own unique twist like Royal Crown Revue did with "Baby It's Cold Outside" by giving it a swing flavor. Ivy's trip hop interpretation of the Charlie Brown classic "Christmas Time is Here" had a seductive element thanks to its laid back electronic grooves. I loved The Polyphonic Spree's cover of John Lennon's classic "Happy Xmas (War is Over)". There isn't one song on the album I didn't like. Despite not being a fan of Jars of Clay and Lisa Loeb, they did alright with the songs they covered. MAYBE THIS CHRISTMAS TREE has quickly become one of my favorite Christmas cds of all time.

If you like Loreena McKennitt, Celtic Woman, and Enya, you probably will like Elane. Elane is a relatively obscure German band whose music should be heard by all. I discovered this band late last year and been hooked since. The music is an enchanting mix of celtic, folk, and a smidgeon of goth. Vocalist Joran has a lovely voice. There are moments through out the cd that is eerily reminiscent of Loreena McKennitt. Her voice is never overwhelming ala Celine Dion and Whitney Houston or underwhelming like Britney Spears. Simon, Nico, and Skaldir back up Joran's vocals with their lush instrumentation. They keep their roles limited to the background and never drowns out Joran's vocals."Fire of Glenvore" is the band's recent album. The music is absolutely gorgeous with its lush Celtic melodies. Unlike a lot of folk albums, "Fire of Glenvore" has a darker edge and that is because of the dark lyrics. All of the songs are wonderful but the songs that really stood out for me are "Moonlight Shadow", "Roselake", "Der Nachtwald", and "Trace of the Flames". I am especially fond of the last two songs on the cd "Moonlight Shadow" and "Roselake", two gorgeous piano ballads.If you love Loreena McKennitt and celtic/folk music, "Fire of Glenvore" is definitely worth getting your hands on. The music is simply beautiful. It is rare to hear music this gorgeous.

Blutengel is my favorite band at the moment which has been just a year since I have started listening to them. Their music is somewhere between goth, ebm, and industrial music. "My Saviour" is the band's latest effort. It is a 23 minute long EP. The EP consists of three new songs and two remixes:1. My Saviour2. Verdammnis3. My Saviour (Cephalgy remix)4. My Saviour (Unholy remix by Adam)5. In Winter"My Saviour" is the most aggressive track on the cd with its fast pace dance beats. It's a pretty good song with the high energy EBM beats but the melody is somehow lacking compared to "Verdammnis" and "In Winter". The remixes to "My Saviour" are really good. I especially like the Cephalgy mix which slows down the beats down a bit and turns the song into a ballad (almost). The Unholy remix was good too but there wasn't anything new that the remixer added. The song sounded like it was all scratched up.As for the other two songs "Verdammnis" and "In Winter", they were great. They stood out more with me than "My Saviour" and its remixes. I especially love the gorgeous ballad "In Winter". Chris Pohl is easily the sexiest male singer with his deep baritone voice and it shows on "In Winter". American Idol's Taylor Hicks has nothing on Chris Pohl, much less have any talent. "Verdammnis" is a catchy EBM number not too different from the likes of "Navigator" and "Angels of the Lost (Lost Area Remix)".It is too bad that I can't find Blutengel's music in stores and have to buy their stuff online. Thankfully "My Saviour" is pretty cheap unlike their earlier albums. "My Saviour" is definitely a must have for Blutengel fans.

I have to be the first to admit that I don't like romantic comedies. I find them saccherine sweet with unrealistic ideals on true love. But last year, I stumbled upon a little independent film called "Saving Face" which showed me that not all romantic comedies are unrealistic and will give me cavities.The film stars Michelle Krusiec as Wil, a young, talented surgeon and Joan Chen as her mother Ma. Just as Wil begins to start dating a gorgeous ballerina named Vivian (the stunning Lynn Chen), Wil's world comes crashing when she is forced to let her mom move in because she is pregnant and won't name the father. Lots of laughs ensues when Ma's old world ways and Wil's modern ways collide. In an ironic twist of fate both women keeps their pregnancy and love life a secret.The primary focus of "Saving Face" is on the relationship between Ma and Wil. In fact, this film is a love letter to the director Alice Wu's mother. I like the fact that the relationships that both women are involved in are not traditional and are portrayed in a honest, truthful manner. I found the writing smart and hilarious especially during the scene between Ma, Wil, and Wil's neighbor Jay.Granted the ending of the film is a bit questionable as far as realism is concerned but I still found it humorous. I especially like the scenes during the closing credits. I also loved Ma's so-called friends who had nothing better to do than gossip. Alice Wu did a great job in both writing, directing, and casting. I can only hope that her future films will be as entertaing as "Saving Face" was and still is to me.

I don't know why I waited so long to get the latest Erasure album LIGHT AT THE END OF THE WORLD since I am such a huge fan of the synthpop group. I am glad I finally got it. LIGHT AT THE END OF THE WORLD is classic Erasure all the way with the group's infectious melodies and earnest lyrics. The album is just under 40 minutes long but it is 39 minutes of synthpop bliss. The lyrics on this album reflects the break up between Andy and his partner, a relationship that lasted for nearly twenty years. Despite the tone of the subject matter, the songs are surprisingly upbeat beat-wise as well as lyrically. There is no bitterness or rancor. One of my personal favorite songs on the album is "Sunday Girl". The addictively catchy melodies makes it hard for me to listen to the song just once. The rest of the album is a lot of fun to listen to. I have to admit I had to listen to the album a few times before the music really sunk into my head. Overall great album.

I would be the first to admit I don't know a lick fo spanish. I decided to check out Kany Garcia's cd CUALQUIER DIA on a whim. I always have enjoyed music from all over the world so my curiousity was piqued so I ordered her cd. Much to my delight I have found CUALQUIER DIA very enjoyable. I couldn't help but notice how similiar Kany's music as well vocals were to fellow Latino artists Shakira and a smidgen of Paulina Rubio. Kany's music is a melodic blend of pop and rock. All of her songs are sung in spanish. Unlike Shakira, Kany's vocals aren't so shrill. I find myself preferring the uptempo tracks than the ballads. The ballads aren't bad but I just find the melodies in her uptempo songs a lot more melodic. The one ballad that I really did like is track 8 "Que Nos Paso". That is my personal favorite. Regardless of the language barrier I like what I have heard by Kany Garcia. She shows a lot of promise and I think she will have a bright future in music.

I own 4 of these floating thermometers in my fish tanks. They keep an accurate reading of the temperature in my bettas' tanks. I also have learned that one of my bettas will view the thermometer as a potential threat and will flare at it which I find to be quite amusing. I found in the past that strip thermometers are very unreliable so I switched over to the floating thermometer. My only beef is that the suction cup eventually loses its grip. Overall I would definitely recommend the floating thermometer. It is very easy to read.

I grew up in the 1980s when pop music was at its most interesting peak. Cyndi Lauper was and still is one of my favorite artists from that era. While Madonna continues to churn out and sell more (awful) albums, Cyndi has kept putting out more interesting albums. I will say I was not crazy about her last cd of jazz standards she covered. Thankfully Cyndi makes up for that awful cd with THE BODY ACOUSTIC.THE BODY ACOUSTIC is another cd of cover songs but this time the songs are all Cyndi Lauper's, going back to the 1980s when she was enormously popular. Not only does Cyndi re-invent her own songs as acoustic tracks but she also collaborates with a diverse range of artists like the Japanese power pop duo Puffy AmiYumi, Ani Difranco, Sarah McLachlan, Shaggy, and Vivian Green. The results is immensely satisfying for me. I didn't think that Cyndi's duet with Shaggy "All Through the Night" wouldn't work but much to my surprise, the duet works. This new version is as good as the original version. I personally loved the latest version of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" with Puffy AmiYumi. I guess as Puffy AmiYumi fan, I am biased. I definitely like this version better than the last updated version which I thought stunk to high heavens. Who would have imagined that "She Bop" would sound good acoustically but it did. I especially loved the acoustic version of "True Colors". This version gave the goose bumps the first time I heard it.I loved every song on the cd. Cyndi sounds wonderful as ever. I always felt she had a superior voice than Madonna. The songs still sounds fresh and never dated despite the obvious tweaking. The energy and the fun never left the songs. I'm glad I picked up this cd when I had the opportunity to get it.

I love Enya's music. I find her music very soothing to relax to especially after spending 8 hours at the office and listening to mostly gothic and industrial music on my iPod. Listening to Enya's music help takes that edge off. My personal favorite Enya cd is THE CELTS. I still own the cassette version of this album back when it was only known as ENYA. While I do like Enya's other albums, none of them match the beauty of THE CELTS. I can listen to this cd without a skipping a single track. I personally think the songs flows well together. It is hard for me to pick out a favorite song. I will say that the standout tracks on the cd includes the title track, "March of the Celts", and "Boadicea". After a decade plus some years, THE CELTS somehow manages to sound fresh to me as the first time I listened to my cassette version in the car.

I am newbie to Unter Null's music. I discovered Erica Dunham's main music project on the internet last year. Her brand of EBM is both abrasive and melodic similiar to Suicide Commando and Amduscia. Erica's vocals is a mix of distorted and clean. I finally bought my first Unter Null cd not too long ago. It is "Sacrament", one half of a two part EP set (the other is "Absolution"). "Sacrament" is a half hour long set of killer dance beats and harsh distorted vocals. The crisp synthesized dance beats are upbeat and highly energetic. The one song I find myself hitting the repeat button on my stereo is "This is Your End" (T3chnophobia Mix). The beats are bouncy and energetic and the melody is addictive. Don't get me wrong, all of the songs on the EP is awesome but "This is Your End" is the one song that really stood out for me. After listening to "Sacrament" several times already tonight, I have already submitted an order for "Absolution" to complete the two cd set.

Up until last year, I wasn't really familiar with Combichrist. I knew that it wsa one of Andy LePeglua's bands outside of Icon of Coil. I boughtEverybody Hates Youprior to last fall's KMFDM concert to get an idea what the band sounds like. I really enjoyed what I heard on "Everybody Hates You" but it was their live performance that really made me a big fan of the band's music. The song that really stood out for me at the concert was the thunderous "Get Your Body Beat". The song was both aggressive and melodic. I was so glad to see that the song is included on the new Combichrist album "What the F*ck is Wrong with You People?". Prior to the release of the new album, I heard samples of the new music and I really enjoyed what I heard and knew that it was going to be something special. I finally got the album today and I enjoyed it as much as "Everybody Hates You". The music was in your face and energetic. I do though think that it could have been even better if it wasn't so long. I absolutely love the title track, "Electrohead" and "In the Pit". The songs made me want to get up and dance. I loved all the songs but I do think some of them needed some serious editing but otherwise, great album.

Kirlian Camera is one of those bands I have always wanted to check out but either got sidetracked or unable to find their music in my local independent record shops. I have heard songs on the internet by the group and enjoyed what I heard but it wasn't until I heard their song "Blue Room" on a Shinto Records compilation that got me wanting to delve into the group's catalog. PICTURES FROM ETERNITY is my first Kirlian Camera album that I bought not too long ago.PICTURES FROM ETERNITY was originally released in 1996. This version I bought is a remastered version which includes three bonus tracks. I am glad I decided to start off with one of the band's earlier albums. I find myself hopelessly addicted to the band's music which is a mixture of ambient, pop, and industrial. I particularly love both versions of "Ascension" but I particularly enjoyed the temple version of the song. Another great song I enjoy listening to on the album is "Your Face in the Sun". Emilialo Jacono's distinctive vocals makes listening to that song (as well as "Ascension") immensely enjoyable. I also enjoyed the instrumental tracks like "Tauko A" and "Kaalk". Of course they aren't nearly as fabulous as the songs that Emilialo sings on. Overall I loved PICTURES FROM ETERNITY. The album solidified me as a Kirlian Camera fan. I definitely plan on trying to obtain as many of their past and present albums as I can within reasonable means.

I love discovering new anime series. Some of it is good and some of it is not so good. My latest discovery is the first collection of xxxHolic. xxxHolic is about a young high school student named Watanuki. For all of his young life, Watanuki had to deal with demon spirits who would find a way to never let the young man have any peace in his life. It wasn't until he comes across a curio shop run by Yuko, a dimensional witch who grants wishes for a price, that those dark, demon spirits were vanquished from his life courtesy of Yuko. Of course there is always a price to pay. Watanuki involuntarily becomes a part time employee at Yuko's shop.What I liked about the series is the beautiful animation. The colors can be both vibrant and subtle. What I didn't like is how annoying some of the characters were. I also like how the characters were drawn, long and slender. Watanuki totally grates on my nerves. His whining and self-absorbtion made me hit the mute button on several times. Then there is Mokona, some bizarre rabbit like creature that is just as annoying as any Pokemon character. At first Mokona was cute but that thing quickly got on my nerves as much as Watanuki did. The writing wasn't terribly interesting. It left something to be desired or at least on the last two episodes on this dvd.xxxHolic isn't awful by all means but it is certainly flawed. Will I want to check out the other chapters in the series? Probably not because how annoying the characters are.

I am a long time Loreena McKennitt fan. Her voice is what captured my heart and soul back in high school almost twenty years ago.I have finally got the chance to hear one of Loreena's older albums, her winter solstice themed TO DRIVE THE COLD WINTER AWAY. For the first time I was actually not taken with the album right away. The music lacked the haunting melodies that I have come to love in Loreena's music. I had to listen to this cd several times for the music to sink in.What I have noticed on TO DRIVE THE COLD WINTER AWAY is that the general sound of the music is more classical with a hint of mediaval, and lacks the celtic sounds I am so familiar with in recent albums by Loreena. For the first time, I actually found a Loreena McKennitt song I did not like one bit and that was "The King". Where on earth was Loreena's beautiful voice? Thank heavens the song is rather short. The same can be said about the instrumental "Banquet Hall" but I rather liked the instrumental more so than "The King".I really wanted to like this album as much as her more recent albums. TO DRIVE THE COLD WINTER AWAY isn't terrible per say but compared to albums like MASK AND MIRROR and BOOK OF SECRETS, this album falls rather flat in comparison. Nevertheless the music is anything but your traditional holiday album.

It has been awhile for me since I have listened to a Mary Chapin Carpenter cd. I was a huge fan of hers when I was in collage over a decade ago. After STONES IN THE ROAD, I wasn't really impressed with her body of work and I moved on. I recently came across Mary's latest album THE CALLING at my library and I decided to check it out and see what she has been up to lately. Listening to THE CALLING for me was like finding your favorite pajamas that you lost years ago and then found again, and when you put them on again, it is as if nothing has changed. The music was warm and soothing. For me, THE CALLING reminded me of STONES IN THE ROAD with its personal and introspective lyrics. I enjoyed every song on the album especially the ballads like "Twilight" and "On and On it Goes". After a decade hiatus from her music, THE CALLING was a great re-introduction to Mary Chapin Carpenter. Her talents as a singer/songwriter on her new album quickly reminded me why I always liked her music.

I do not like American Idol, never have never will. Most of the contestants don't interest me. The only contestant that barely registered any interest from me is Chris Daughtry thanks to his cover of a Keith Urban song on the show. I finally decided now was a time to check out his cd. Much to my surprise I found myself listening to the cd over and over again this weekend. DAUGHTRY is a solid hard rock album. The songs are reminiscent of Nickelback and a hint of Velvet Revolver (or at least on "What I Want" w/Slash). This album is perfect to listen to on road trips. Every song has that sounds especially good cranked up while travelling across the country. DAUGHTRY has a nice mix of rockers and ballads. Unfortunately those comparisons are also Chris's downfall. It isn't to say that Chris's sound isn't good but his hard rock sound tends to sound redundant and bland. I felt like I was listening to Nickelback throughout the album. I hope on future releases Chris tries to develop his own sound. He does shows a lot of potential as an artist and in my personal opinion, the only talented artist to come out of that dreadful American Idol show.

Unter Null (aka Erica Dunham) is easily one of my top five favorite industrial acts of all time. I love how Erica finds a harmonious balance with infectious melodies,harsh, abrasive beats and scalding vocals. I finally downloaded THE FAILURE EPIPHANY, the debut album of Unter Null. I don't know why I waited so long but I am glad I finally did. The album totally blew me away. I knew it was going to be good but I didn't know just how good. The music is corrosive. I can hear the rage in Erica's distorted vocals, and it particularly shows in songs like "Martyr", "Your Nightmare", and "Sick F***k". Despite the harsh, distorted vocals, the music is drenched in pop friendly hooks which is a great contrast with Erica's seething lyrics and vocals. The rage that Erica writes and sings in her music truly can be felt. I loved every single track on THE FAILURE EPIPHANY. It is raw and abrasive yet melodic. For me, THE FAILURE EPIPHANY is a true industrial classic.

Nightwish is my favorite metal band of all time. I own most of the band's cds and was fortunate to have seen the band live before the dismissal of Tarja Turunen. After listening to their music recently, I had to check out one of their dvds as a trip down memory lane. "End of Innocence". Most of the dvd consists of a chat with Tuomas, the band's founder and composer with a few comments here and there from the drummer. This was around the end of the Century Child tour for the beand. As most reviewers have written here, the sound on the dvd isn't so hot. It is pretty bad to be honest. The cinematography isn't any better either. The sound and cinematography left me with the impression that this documentary was thrown together at the last minute and on a really tight budget. I did though like seeing behind the scenes footage of the band as well as the videos for "End of Ages" and "Over the Hills and Far Away". I just wished that more thought and effort was put into this dvd. This dvd felt too lazy and cheaply made.

I recently became a fan of Ladytron's music when I first heard samples of their latest album VELOCIFER and bought the album. I took to the album like white on rice and obviously the next step was for me to start checking out their other albums. I recently got a hold of their 2006 album WITCHING HOUR. WITCHING HOUR is more dance orientated than their latest cd which ventures into the shoegazing territory. When I think of the term "electroclash", I think of Fischerspooner and their short lived stint in the spotlight. I didn't care for their music so that really put me off to music that fell under the electroclash genre. So when I heard WITCHING HOUR recently I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this sort of music but maybe because it wasn't done in such a dreary repetive manner that Fischerspooner did with their overrated first album #1.I have a couple of friends who didn't care for WITCHING HOUR but I personally love the album. The songs were fun, bouncy and infectious. I love the ethereal vocals of Helen Marnie. She has this whispy sound to her voice that is reminiscent of Micki Beranyi of the defunct band Lush. Mira Aroyo's plaintive vocals is pleasant to listen to but I definitely prefer Helen's vocals. Most of the songs on the album I love like "Destroy Everything You Touch" and "International Dateline" but there were 1, 2 songs that didn't hit a chord with me. I thought "Soft Power" was rather dull. And "Fighting in Built Up Areas" was too monotonous for my liking. Overall I think WITCHING HOUR is a solid dance album from my latest favorite band.

I can't pretend I like country music. I am not a fan of country music. The music I am into is anything but mainstream. I do though like Johnny Cash, Kasey Chambers, and early Mary Chapin Carpenter. When the Dixie Chicks first came out several years ago, I didn't really blick an eye and pay any attention to the women. Their music was a bit too twangy for my tastes.I recently decided to give the the Chicks a chance after their sweep at this year's Grammys did my curiousity got the better of me so I went with their latest album TAKING THE LONG WAY. I always did like the first single "Not Ready to Make Nice". The song itself is an obvious response at the controversy over what Natalie Maines said a few years ago. Her obvious anger from the death threats she and her bandmates (and their families) received resulted in what I think is one of the band's strongest and most compelling songs ever.I have to be honest I did not have any expectations when I acquired a copy of TAKING THE LONG WAY but much to my surprise, I found myself enjoying the cd immensely. I liked the harmonizing that goes on through out the album between the Robison sisters Emily and Martie, and Natalie Maines. The songwriting is strong. It is obvious that the songs were written from personal experiences from having children to the controversy over Natalie's comments. There were a couple of songs that I did not care for simply because I didn't like the melodies and they were too twangy.Uber producer Rick Rubin certainly leaves an imprint on the album by creating an intimate, personal sound on this album. The band's collaborations with local MN singer/songwriters Dan Wilson, Gary Louris as well as national artists like Sheryl Crow and Keb 'Mo certainly helped the women's lyrics evolve into something more personal and less goofy like "Goodbye Earl".There are very few albums where I am willing to take a chance on with no expecations, and end up enjoying the music. I am glad I took the risk on TAKING THE LONG WAY. The results was very satisfying for me.

"The Hunger" is easily one of my favorite vampire films of all time. You got David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve along with some gorgeous classical/ambient music. What more can one ask for? Maybe the inclusion of immortal classic "Bela Lugosi's Dead" on the soundtrack but that probably would have probably detracted the sumptuous classical melodies of the soundtrack. Other than that slight flaw, I absolutely love "The Hunger". The soundtrack is a mixture of classical and ambient music. The combination works. The classical tracks are gorgeous. Michel Rubini's film score is nothing short of spine-tingling.His music has the right elements to fit whatever eerie scene it is accompanying in the film. I could definitely hear and feel the terror in his music especially on "The Arisen". Rubini's music had the same elements that made the film score to "Psycho" so eerie and terrifying. Of course can't forget about Delibes' breathtaking "Lakme" (aka Flower Duet). All in all, "The Hunger" is a pretty darn good soundtrack. This is how soundtracks to vampire films ought to sound like. It is both beautiful and terrifying.

I honestly can't say I like country music. I just don't care for most of the genre. The only artist from this genre that I do listen to is Johnny Cash. Of all of the American recordings Johnny has worked on with record producer Rick Rubin, American IV: The Man Comes Around" is easily my personal favorite. As much as I like Johnny's last album American V, I just didn't think the material held up as well as the fourth volume.What I love about American IV: The Man Comes Around is the sparse, haunting melodies that lingers through out the album. Secondly I love Johnny's deep baritone vocals on this cd especially on his covers of "Hurt" and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry". One of my personal favorite tracks is Johnny's cover of the Nine Inch Nails' track "Hurt". The emotions he puts into the song really moved me. I also loved the Sting song "I Hung My Head". Johnny does a great job at storytelling through this song. His voice is so warm and deep on this track. Johnny's duet with Nick Cave on the Hank Williams' classic "I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry" is absolutely stunning. Both men really compliment each other with their own deep vocals.While I do like Johnny's other American recordings, they weren't as perfect to me as American IV: The Man Comes Around is. I can listen to this cd without skipping a single track.

I own three male Betta fishes. I keep them in three separate 3 gallon tanks. I use Prime for all their water changes. I really love how little of the stuff I need to condition the water for my boys' needs in order to survive. A little goes a long way so while it may seem expensive whether it is 16.9 oz or a 2L bottle, you won't be needing to make frequent trips to the pet store for water conditioner like other brands do. This is a definite must have for anyone who owns a fish or two in their homes.

I have to admit I had been a bit wary of hearing Moby's last studio album HOTEL. I had been hearing mixed reviews for it, some good and some bad. I decided to check it out finally after I heard the irresistably catchy "Dream About Me" on Moby's best of compilation. I have to admit I enjoyed this cd a lot more than I thought. Yes HOTEL is not PLAY or even 18 but I think it had some pretty decent songs. It was a bit odd hearing Moby's version of New Order's "Temptation". Hearing the whispy vocals of Laura Dawn sing one of my favorite New Order songs set to a downtempo beat was strange but I loved it. There were some filler tracks that were pretty forgettable for me. The second disc of HOTEL was even better. I find myself listening to the second disc of ambient tracks more than the first disc. The music is perfect to sit back and relax to while reading a good book. While I am glad that HOTEL isn't as a bad as I thought it would be, I definitely do think it could have been better. Here is hope for better music for Moby's next studio album.

12 Girls Band is a musical collective of thirteen women from China. Since the women all belong to other orchestras, it is inevitable that someone in the group would not be able to perform with 12 GB therefore the thirteenth member ensures that the group will be performing with 12 members. I first discovered this group via a tv commercial a few years ago and immediately loved what I heard. "Easter Energy" is the group's first US album. It is a collection of classical, modern pop, and traditional Chinese music. The group's interpretations of Coldplay's "Clocks" and Enya's "Only Time" are excellent. Twelve Girls Band succeeds in re-interpreting the songs with their blend of classical and traditional Chinese music yet maintaining the song's pop essence. My personal favorite song is "Earthly Stars (Unsung Heroes)". What I love aobu the song is that the song has a majestic epic sound that would be perfect in a film like "Curse of the Golden Flower" or "The Promise". There is a bonus dvd that has live footage of the talented band which is worth viewing. All in all great cd.

The term "alternative" nowadays is anything alternative, especially in music. Alternative music hasn't been remotely good for almost ten years now. The 1990s was the decade when alternative rock was at its peak. One of my favorite alternative rock albums to come out of that decade is Hole's blistering breakthrough hit LIVE THROUGH THIS.LIVE THROUGH THIS is Hole's finest album with its raw angst-riddled lyrics and Courtney's eviscerating vocals. You can hear the fury in Courtney's vocals as she tears through songs like "Miss World" and the chorus in "Asking For It". LIVE THROUGH THIS isn't the most melodic album I have heard from the '90s and at times I get tired of Courtney's screaming. Courtney really did capture the angst that many people like myself felt at the time in the '90s. There was a raw honesty on LIVE THROUGH THIS that I haven't heard after that album was released. My personal favorite song on the album is the ballad "Softer, Softest". Hearing Courtney turn her rage down a few notches was a nice change. My least favorite track has to be "She Walks On Me". I get a headache just thinking about this noisy, tuneless track. While I do prefer the sounds of L7 and Babes in Toyland, I still enjoyed Hole as much as the next person.

Stripped & Stitched is a collection of remixes and acoustic tracks from Android Lust. I recently picked up a copy earlier this week because I have fallen in love with the acoustic version of "Refuse" which I discovered through youtube. The remixes are very good. As good as the remixes are, I think the real gems are "Drown", "Sin", "Refuse" and "Burn". I really like Shikhee's vocals in particular on "Sin" and "Refuse". I always enjoy hearing her sing, not that I don't enjoy her shriek or scream on the harder tracks. I definitely recommend Stripped & Stitched for any Android Lust fan. The acoustic tracks alone makes it worth the purchase.

Up until now I had never heard of Giorgia Fumanti. Last week I was at a major retail book store looking for a good reason to use my gift card. I came across FROM MY HEART by Giorgia Fumanti when I was perusing the classical section. After I heard samples of the cd, I was immediately hooked. I didn't leave the store with that cd that day but within a couple of days later I was able to find a cheap but unused copy of FROM MY HEART on the internet. I got my copy of the cd yesterday in the mail and have been listening to it non-stop.For Sarah Brighman, Sasha Lazard, Charlotte Church fans, Italian opera singer Giorgia Fumanti is right up your alley. FROM MY HEART is a collection of beautiful classical/pop songs that is sure to tug at your heart strings. Giorgia's vocals reminds me a bit of Sasha Lazard. I can completely understand every word she sings. One of my personal favorite songs is Italian translation of Sting's "Fields of Gold". I liked hearing the lyrics being sung in another language. Another favorite is "A Rose Among Thorns" which is a variation on the ever so popular "Nella Fantasia". I liked hearing the song with different lyrics. That was a nice touch. After hearing the song on so many classical/pop cds, the different lyrics were quite refreshing to me. Every song on the cd is wonderful in their own right. FROM MY HEART is a must have for classical/crossover fans.

Ever since I saw the film The Runaways last weekend, I had been checking out the music by The Runaways as well as Joan Jett via the internet. Today I had a strong urge for some Joan Jett so I went out and bought her album Sinner. Regardless of age, Joan Jett still sounds amazing as ever with her raspy vocals. Time has not affected her vocal chords. She sounds as good as she did when she was with The Runaways. Her songs on Sinner are fast, raw, and catchy. Songs like "Riddle" and "Androgynous" (excellent cover of The Replacements). In this day and age of disposable pop music, it is great to see artists like Joan Jett still putting out good, quality music that is able to stand the test of time. With the release of The Runways movie, I do hope that the public will re-discover Joan Jett's music.

For the longest time, I have been meaning to check out the HorrorPops's music since I read an interview with them in a magazine a few years ago. I recently acquired a copy of the band's second album BRING IT ON! through my library. The band's brand of psychobilly, punk, ska, new wave, and rockabilly isn't what I normally listen to but I definitely took an immediate liking to what I heard. BRING IT ON isn't a great album but I liked it a lot. A few of the songs weren't all that great but songs like "Walk Like a Zombie" and "You vs. Me" makes up for the blandness of "Freaks in Uniforms" and "It's Been so Long". I am especially fond of "Walk Like a Zombie" which is addictively infectious. The pop hooks has a '60s retro pop quality that I totally dug. The lyrics are a real hoot too. I like the horror aspect of their lyrics. Bassist and lead singer Patricia Day reminds me a great deal of Siouxsie Sioux. While BRING IT ON may not be a great album but I think it was worth checking out for this new fan. For me it was a great introduction to the HorrorPops. I am definitely going to have to check out their first and latest cds.

I am a big fan of vampire mythology. I consider Bram Stoker's "Dracula" classic. When I heard that Masterpiece Theatre had done their own interpretation of the immortal classic, I was excited to see this new version. What a major let down this film was. Now I wasn't expecting a word for word interpretation. I knew that there would be some changes made to the story, I just didn't know how bad those changes would be. Masterpiece Theatre totally massacred Bram Stoker's novel. Screenwriter Stewart Harcourt should have stuck to the novel instead of using metaphors and analogies. Dumb idea. I didn't like how the character Jonathan Harker was reduced to a minor character while Dr. John Seward and Lord Arthur Holmwood each received a bigger role in the story. I won't even get into the sub-plot of Arthur joing some bizarre cult that worships Dracula. That was lame. That idea would have been perfect for any B movie that stars Darian Cane but not for a Masterpiece Theatre production. I also did not enjoy the actor who played Dracula, Marc Warren. He was not remotely attractive nor a good actor. His performance was laughable at best. His performance was overwrought to say the very least. He would have been the ideal Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde or Frankenstein but the last person I would consider to play Dracula. Marc lacked the grace and elegance of the character Dracula. As hammy as Bela Lugosi was back in his day, he was a much better Dracula than Marc Warren. The women were the only good actors in this lifeless adaptation. The costumes and scenery were nice to look at but overall not a very good interpretation of one of my favorite novels. Yes Bram Stoker's novel is not Shakespeare and leaves lots of room for interpretation but what BBC and Masterpiece Theatre did was run the novel through a paper shredder. This film was a total insult to the story. At least this was a lot better than that dreadful vampire flick "Bloodrayne" and that is saying a mouthful.

I first came across 8mm on Myspace a few years ago. I finally got around to buying one of their cds recently. A few weekends ago I found a new, unsealed copy of Songs to Love and Die By at my local used cd store and of course bought it. As a big fan of trip hop music, Songs to Love and Die By was an immediate hit with me. I really enjoyed listening to Juliette's delicate vocals set to Sean's laid-back electronic beats and the occasional acoustic guitar. I think the strongest tracks on the album are "Stunning", "Never Enough", "Liar", and "Quicksand". The songs really captures all the elements that I like in trip hop music. I wish I bought this cd sooner but I suppose better late than never.

I was at a local bookstore and in its cd section when I came across the new Megan McCauley cd. I first heard of Megan a few years ago with the song she did for the (horrible) Fantastic Four film, and liked what I heard. After hearing samples of BETTER THAN BLOOD, I decided that I liked it enough to buy it. I am surprised by how much I like BETTER THAN BLOOD considering the type of music I listen to on a regular basis which is a lot darker and heavier than Megan McCauley's music. The music is very poppy but with a hard rock edge. There is lots of pop hooks that will get stuck in your head. Imagine Avril Lavigne joing Evanescence and Megan McCauley is what you would get, but nowhere nearly as annoying as Avril Lavigne. The main weakness of Megan's album is the songwriting. Her songwriting skills definitely need working on. I found songs like "Tap That" unbelievably corny and "Migraine" to be contrived. The silliness of "Tap That" even bears a striking resemblence to Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend". Almost but not quite. Megan's real strength lies in her vocals. Megan does know how to sing, now if only she could learn how to write a good song that doesn't sound so juvenile.

When "Lovefool" first came out several years ago, I thought it was a fun, kitschy pop song. Unfortunately that song got played into ad nauseum no thanks to radio and MTV. When GRAN TURISMO came out, the public obviously were expecting to hear another "Lovefool" but instead got a Garbage-lite sound. The results were dismal record sales. I liked GRAN TURISMO as well as the other Cardigans' cd but eventually moved on as did the band itself (until recently).Not too long ago I came across a copy of SUPER EXTRA GRAVITY and decided to check it out. Much to my pleasant surprise I found myself enjoying the entire cd. The music is anything but like that wretched, overplayed song "Lovefool". The music isn't as dark as GRAN TURISMO but it certainly is more guitar orientated than the band's earlier albums which were more '60s pop/lounge sounding. The only flaw with the album is that Nina Persson sounded an awfully like Sheryl Crow and I can't stand Sheryl Crow. Despite the Sheryl Crow comparisons, I am glad The Cardigans didn't go back to that retro/lounge pop sound. I thought that sound made them more of a novelty act, along with the occasional cover song. My favorite song on the entire cd is the addictively catchy song "Good Morning Joan". I am addicted to the infectious pop hooks. I liked all of the songs altogether. I'm glad that the band didn't return to their old sound and picked up where GRAND TURISMO left off but with less darker lyrics and music.

I never really given much thought to Marie Antoinette. All I knew about the former queen of France was that she was beheaded after found guilty of various crimes ranging from corruption to treason. After I saw the lifeless Sophia Coppola film "Marie Antoinette", my curiousity about the former queen was piqued. This PBS documentary was aired not too long ago but I missed seeing most of it. I was fortunate to find a copy to rent through the web based rental service I use.I found "Marie Antoinette" the documentary far more engaging. The life of Marie Antoinette is indeed fascinating. She almost reminds me of Paris Hilton of her day with her lack of intellectual curiousity and love of frivolous spending and other means of pleasure. It is hard not to see the comparison between the deceased queen of France and the current queen of overexposure.In the PBS documentary, the filmmaker goes further in depth of Marie Antoinette's life after she and Louis tries to leave Paris, France and eventually their gruesome fate at the hands of the guillotine. I would have liked to have heard more about Marie's life prior to her marriage to Louis (like it was covered in thorough detail in Antoina Fraser's book). Blair Brown does a superb job as narrator. I found this documentary extremely well produced and thought out. There are other documentaries on Marie Antoinette but I only imagine that they would be not as good as PBS's two hour documentary on Marie Antoinette. I had fun learning about Marie Antoinette which led me to check out more books and documentaries about the former queen of France.

There aren't many soundtracks nowdays where the music leaves a profound effect on me. A lot of soundtracks to me are pretty disposable, not "Garden State". The soundtrack to the quirky dramedy from Scrubs's own Zach Braff is the exact opposite. "Garden State" has that great mixed taped feel, thanks in part to Zach's great taste in music. The music is an eclectic mix of alternative (Coldplay), indie (The Shins), trip hop (Zero 7), and folk (Nick Drake). The songs Zach chose really captured the essence of the scenes in the film they were in. The one song that really stood out on the entire cd was "New Slang" by The Shins. I just love the simple acoustic arrangements and toe-tapping melodies. My other favorite songs are the moving Remy Zero track "Fair" and "Such Great Heights" by Iron and Wine. Almost two years later, I still love listening to "Garden State" (as well as watching the film). This is easily one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.

I'm probably one of the few people who couldn't get into the tv series SIX FEET UNDER. I tried but I just couldn't get into the show however I always liked the music that they used in the series. While I did enjoy the first SIX FEET UNDER soundtrack, the second volume is my personal favorite. Like the soundtrack to GARDEN STATE, SIX FEET UNDER VOL. 2: EVERYTHING captures that mixed tape feel with its eclectic collection of artists ranging from jazz great Nina Simone to alternative rock heroes The Arcade Fire. I personally like the varied sounds on the soundtrack. The diverse sound certainly captured the essence of the dark mood of the show. There was not one song on the soundtrack that I did not like.

I am a new fan of Colony 5's music. I recently got into their brand of synthpop/futurepop earlier this summer when I started listening to their music online. I think the first Colony 5 song I heard and loved was "Plastic World". After checking other Colony 5 songs, I decided to order it through an independent record label. While I was waiting for the cd, I downloaded Colonisation which I loved. I recently got Fixed in the mail after a rather lengthy wait. It automatically solidified me as a huge fan of the duo. I am hopelessly addicted to the melodies and crisp dance beats. All of the songs makes me want to get up and dance. There is not one single song on the album that I did not enjoy.

"House of Flying Daggers" is one of my favorite Asian films from the past five years. One of the main reasons I love the film is the sumptuous classical film score by Shigeru Umebayashi. The classical score reminded me a great deal of the score for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The operatic ballad by Kathleen Battle is stunning. I don't normally like most opera music but I definitely enjoyed listening to Kathleen Battle. This is a lovely cd to relax to with a hot cup of tea and a good book.

Zal is my first sToa album. I finally got around to buying the album after listening to a few tracks online. I find Olaf Parusel's compositions on the album simply breathtaking. The vocals by Antje Bucheiser adds a lot to Olaf's music. Her voice is just wonderful to listen to. The album consists of both songs with vocals and instrumentals. I love listening to Zal at night with a nice cup of hot tea or while taking a hot bath. The neo-classical melodies just warms my heart. Very soothing and relaxing to listen to. After listening to Zal, I definitely plan on buying their other albums in the near future. This is just wonderful music.

I am not ashamed to admit this...I did not like the film "Marie Antoinette". I didn't like that Sophia Coppola only focused on one segment of Marie Antoinette's life based on the Antonia Fraser biography. What I also didn't like mixing of modern rock music when the setting of the film goes back a two, three centuries ago. I guess Sophia Coppola's intentions was to show the filmgoer that Marie Antoinette had a lot in common with today's teenagers. If that was the case, her concept failed with me. For me, I felt the music made the film seem like one long extended music video, not a movie.Regardless of how I feel about the combination, the songs themselves were great. I am a product of the '80s so the majority of theses songs. I am especially a big Siouxsie & The Banshees fan. "Hong Kong Garden" is one of my top five personal favorite Siouxsie songs. The song has a great hook to. Of course gotta love the two Cure songs on the soundtrack, especially "Plainsong" from the immortal classic "Disintegration". Gorgeous sweeping ballad. I never get tired of that song. I also dug the indie rock bands that Sophia chose for the soundtrack, especially Windsor for the Derby and The Radio Dept. They had a nice gentle, lush sound. The instrumentals on disc two were equally great. It is a shame that the music and the film didn't sound right together because I really did love the music (unlike the film).

Babes in Toyland is my favorite band from the Saint Paul/Minneapolis area. I hold them with the same high regards as locals have for Prince. I think Babes in Toyland is the band that Courtney Love and Hole wishes that they could be. I always felt in the national alternative music scene that Babes in Toyland were vastly ignored and unappreciated.My favorite Babes in Toyland cd is FONTANELLE. It is 37 minutes of blistering punk music. You can definitely hear where Courtney Love gets her inspiration from in Kat Bjelland's caustic, abrasive vocals. Like Love, Kat goes back and forth from singing sweetly to screaming like a banshee. The rage just seeps out of Kat's voice. She totally rips on the opening track "Bruise Violet" and "Handsome and Gretyl". Kat's guitar skills is more than adequate, better than a lot of the women in the riot grrl movement that weren't really concerned with abilities and more so with the message that they were sending. Drummer Lori Barbero is really the heart and soul of the band with her thunderous skills that rivals most men. Lori even steps up to the mic to sing on a couple of tracks like "Blood" and "Magick Flute" (two of my personal favorite songs on the cd). Lori's powerful drumming abilities comes to light on those two songs in particular.I haven't listened to FONTANELLE in years and just re-discovered one of my favorite albums from high school. The music still sounds amazingly fresh and new to my ears. The angst and fury in the lyrics do not sound trite and phoney like in today's music (especially female artists).

Arthur Golden's "Memoirs of a Geisha" is one of my all time favorite novels. The fictional story about a popular geisha named Sayuri was spellbinding and well researched. I was thoroughly disappointed in the film adaptation because the director Rob Marshall who ruined the story completely by having the cast speak in perfect American english. I wasn't thrilled with his choice for the protagonist of the story Ziyi Zhang as Sayuri. I will admit that the film was visually stunning. As an accompaniment to the film, there is an interesting coffee table book about the film by Peggy Mulloy. The book contains photos from the film and behind the scenes. I couldn't help but noticed that the behind the scenes material in this book can also be viewd on the bonus dvd to "Memoirs of a Geisha". That is the biggest flaw with this book. The book offers nothing new to the reader that wasn't mentioned on the dvd. I will say that the photographs are absolutely gorgeous especially the ones with Gong Li in them.

After four years since its release, "Beneath the Surface" has remained one of my favorite cds of all time. The cd is absolutely stunning with its blend of pop, new age,ambient, and trance music. The ethereal female vocals are equally gorgeous. The music reminds me of Enigma, Delerium, Conjure One, and Sleepthief. The music is totally soothing to listen to with its lush electronic beats. It is hard to pick a favorite song off the album. All of the songs on "Beneath the Surface" are wonderful. The last I have heard is that Balligomingo is currently working on a follow up album. I hope I don't have to wait until next year to hear the music.

SPIRITED AWAY is definitely one of the best animated films that I have seen in the past decade. The story about Chihiro, a young girl who was shy and felt isolated from others, quickly learns to grow up and become more proactive when her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba. The classic Miyazaki film is given a wonderful film score by Joe Hisaishi and the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. The music is a beautiful mix of modern classical. The sounds ranges from playful to dramatic. My most personal favorite track is the delightful vocal track "Always With Me" with Youmi Kimura. It is a pretty ballad. That song is one of the main reasons I bought the cd. I also love "Day of the River" (a beautiful piano instrumental which reminds me of something George Winston would create) and "The Return". I enjoyed SPIRITED AWAY from the beginning to the end. It is definitely worth having for fans of the film and who had enjoyed the music as much as the film.

Country music is a genre I usually tend to avoid like the bubonic plague. I find the majority of it annoying to the nth degree. I will though make the rare occasion with Johnny Cash, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Kasey Chambers, Lucinda Williams, and Martina McBride. I will admit that at one point I even owned a couple of Martina's cds over the years before my musical tastes evolved into something edgier, darker, and more aggressive.I recently got a hold of Martina's greatest hits from a several years ago. I almost forgot just how great of a singer she is compared to a lot of female artists nowadays (regardless of genre). I do though wish that "The Time has Come" from Martina's first album was on the album. Other than missing that particular song, I enjoyed listening to Martina's greatest hits especially "Independence Day" which for some ODD reason has kept Martina off some country radio's playlists to this very day. I guess the truth hurts. I am still emotionally moved by the lyrics. I don't know why since I have never been the victim of domestic abuse but the song resonates with me. I also still love "My Baby Loves Me" and "Safe in the Arms of Love" and "Wild Angels". As sappy as "Valentine" is, I actually like the song. Big guilty pleasure with me. A lot of the songs on the cd are new to me. I particularly like "Wrong Again". Great melodies.What I like about Martina's music is that it is never obnoxiously twangy which is why I hate most country music. Martina really has great taste in picking which songs she will put on her albums. The heartfelt lyrics, catchy melodies, and her powerhouse vocals are an excellent combination.

I am a new listener to Blackmore's Night. Recently I was looking for some Christmas music for my iPod when I discovered Blackmore's Night's Christmas album WINTER CAROLS. What a treasure WINTER CAROLS turned out to be for me. Whenever I think of Ritchie Blackmore, I think of his hard rock work with Deep Purple. Blackmore's Night is such a contrast to his hard rock days in the '60s and '70s. I immensely enjoyed listening to Candice Night's delicate vocals set to Ritchie's acoustic compositions. There is not a single song on the cd that I did not like. This cd really puts the holiday spirit in me. I rarely buy Christmas cds but I really think WINTER CAROLS is one of the best Christmas cds I have ever heard.

"Finding Neverland" is easily one of my top twenty favorite films of all time, and in my top ten favorite films of 2004. The story of "Finding Neverland" was inspired by the life of author/playwright James M. Barrie who is played by the talented Johnny Depp. While I wasn't convinced by his Scottish accent, Johnny makes up for it with is moving performance as a child trapped in a man's body. Stuck in a loveless marriage and trying to recover from a failed play, James Barrie meets widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played by the lovely Kate Winslet) and her four boys and immediately strikes up a genuine platonic friendship with the widow and her boys. James' friendship with the Davies brothers quickly inspire him to create what would eventually evolve into the story of Peter Pan.There were a few changes made in James M. Barrie's story but this film never claimed to be an actual documentary or docudrama of Barrie's life. That aside, "Finding Neverland" was a truly moving film. The gorgeous orchestral film score Jan A.P Kaczmarek helped the film the emotional impact especially the last fifteen minutes of the film. All of the actors involved with the film gave wonderful performances especially Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore.The dvd has some excellent bonus features like outtakes which were hilarious and behind the scene footage. After almost two years since it was released, I still love watching "Finding Neverland". I still get the verklempt whenever I see the ending which actually makes me shed a tear or two.

Ever since I saw the dreadful adaptation of Marie Antoinette's life as a gueen by Sophia Coppola, I have been fascinated by Marie Antoinette and have been trying to learn as much as I can about the former queen of France. I just finished viewing the 1938 black and white classic "Marie Antoinette" starring Norma Shearer, Tyrone Power, John Barrymore, and Robert Morley. Just like Sophia Coppola's film, this 1938 film focuses on Marie Antoinette's life as the dauphine/Queen of France.I have to say that I enjoyed this film much more than the modern telling of Marie Antoinette's life as a queen. Norma Shearer was absolutely gorgeous as the queen. Her performance was riveting. I had my doubts that she would be able to pass herself off as a teenage Marie Antoinette but she did with ease. Her final scenes in the film were emotionally moving. I especially loved her final scenes with Robert Morley as Louis. Robert Morley was excellent as Louis XVI. He was everything that Louis XVI was described to be in the biography by Antonia Fraser. Everyone in the film gave excellent performances.There were a few minor quibbles I took issues with in the story but for the most part I found the film accurate for the most part. I found this film vastly superior over Sophia Coppola's film.

Ever since I heard "Sold" on a Metropolis Records compilation a few years ago, I have been meaning to buy Mono Chrome's Collapse and Sever cd. I finally got my hands on a copy of the cd and have been listening to it non-stop. Claire Voyant's own Victoria Lloyd provides lead vocals while Clint M. Sand provides the music. It took me several listens for Collapse and Sever to sink in because the music tends to sound the same. The repetitive synth beats unfortunately brings down the cd. The beats are danceable but generic beats that you would hear in most EBM bands. What keeps the music afloat is Victoria's vocals. The production wasn't all that hot but it wasn't terrible either. It certainly could have used some improvement. On the other hand, there were lots of solid pop hooks. My favorite song is both versions of "Riveted". I especially loved Assemblage 23's remixed version. I wished the rest of the cd sounded more like that song. If Victoria and Clint ever made another Mono Chrome cd, I hope that they branch out more musically. I was left a bit unimpressed with Collapse & Sever.

I am not fan of today's brand of horror films. I find most, if not all simply too gross to watch. The horror films that I do like instills fear and suspense with a healthy dose of creepiness. Over the weekend I sat down and watched the 1964 film Onibaba by Kaneto Shindo. For a film that is over 40 years old, I was pleasantly surprised by how intense and creepy the film was thanks to the jarring film score and the storyline.When a man is forced to join the military in 14th century Japan, he leaves his mother and wife alone in the swamp to fend for themselves. They barely stay alive by murdering lost samurai soldiers and selling their armor and weapons to a local (sleazy) merchant. When a neighbor Haichi returns, his presence changes the dynamics in the relationship between the mother and her daughter in law and not for the better.Onibaba is definitely not your traditional horror film. It is more psychological. The viewer witnesses the ugliness in human nature and what happens when jealousy and resentment consumes a person which can be destructive. The storyline is a bit predictable which is I only rated this film 4 stars but overall I was immensely entertained.

Over the years, I have sold my fair share of cds for extra cash. There were a few that I later regretted selling. Apoptygma Berzerk's 7 is one of those few cds that I wished I never sold. I recently acquired a copy of last year's remastered version of 7 at a fraction of the cost that is offered here on amazon. 7 has always been my personal favorite Apop cd. The crisp synthesized melodies and throbbing dance beats is what always made me favor this album over the other Apop albums. With 7, I there are no more than two filler songs while on other albums there have been 3-5 songs that I would find myself hitting the forward button on. The only two songs that I really wasn't all that impressed with is "25 Cromwell St" and "Half-Asleep". I wish I still had the original version of 7 to compare it to the remastered version but I don't. I really like how 7 opens up with "Love Never Dies". It is a killer dance song. The operatic sample in the song gives the track an added oomph to the song. Song has a lot of energy. The next two songs continues with that same frantic energy. After not having heard 7 in 3-4 years, the cd still holds up well with me. For me it is classic futurepop. I hope that there will still be some of that in the next Apop album. I liked the most recent album but it wasn't classic Apop.

Of the three studio albums (of original material) Switchblade Symphony had released in their short lived career, SERPENTINE GALLERY is my personal favorite. One of my reasons that I love the album so much is because it was my first Switchblade Symphony album. Not that I did not like BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES and THE THREE CALAMITIES, but I definitely preferred the band's darkwave sound on SERPENTINE GALLERY over the trip hopp-ish sounds of their next two albums. I'll admit the production on the album isn't all that hot but the swirling, jingly guitar riffs and Tina Root's distinct vocals which made up for the poor production. It is hard pressed to not recognize the Siouxsie & The Banshee comparisons with the band. I especially think that Tina's vocals bears a striking resemblence to Siouxsie's vocals on "Wrecking Yard", one of my favorite songs on the album. "Clown" is another favorite with its deep, forbooding melodies. I love every song on the album. I can listen to SERPENTINE GALLERY without skipping a single song. Despite that the album is over a decade old, the music does not sound dated to me.

Most music I listen to nowadays is from the last five years, seven or eight at the most. One of the few select artists I still listen to after fifteen years is Siouxsie & the Banshees. I discovered them in my freshman year in college. TINDERBOX is my personal favorite Siouxsie album. The fact that it has my personal favorite Siouxsie song "Cities in Dust" nakes it all the more sweeter. There are two versions of "Cities in Dust", one of them is an extended version. "The Sweetest Chill" is another favorite song of mine simply for Siouxsie's distinct vocals. The swirling guitar riffs and haunting melodies also makes the song stand out with me. Another great song is "This Unrest". The disjointed melodies are a bit unsettling but in a good way. The song would be perfect in a chase scene in a horror movie. It has the scare elements in the melodies. Every song on the album is great. I can listen to TINDERBOX without hitting the forward button. TINDERBOX is a modern classic that has remained a permanent place in my stereo.

Over the weekend, I came across a copy of the debut album by Myspace sensation Colbie Caillat COCO at my library. As someone who likes to check out new music outside her traditional music of goth, industrial, synthpop, and metal, I thought I would give COCO a chance. I knew I could use something to chill out to after work. COCO isn't innovative or original. If you totally dig that typical singer/songwriter, folk/rock type of music, you certainly won't be disappointed by COCO.Personally? I wasn't all that impressed. Colbie has a fairly decent voice but I can definitely tell her vocal range is limited. The songs themselves are alright but nothing to write home about. They do tread on being bland like the old '70s soft rock band Bread. Still I will admit that Colbie is able to create a good pop hook for her songs. Overall COCO is a pretty good way for Colbie start out but I think she needs to take chances both vocally and lyrically in the future. COCO is predictable and a bit bland. It isn't awful but I can't really recommend it.

LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is one of my favorite films from last year. I was laughing all the way through the dark comedy. I also enjoyed the music as much as I enjoyed the film. The soundtrack consists of instrumentals, indie pop, and dance music. Up until the movie, I had never heard of the artist Devotchka. I was reminded a bit of Iron & Wine and The Shins with his brand of indie pop/folk music. The film score by Michael Danna was just as good. I especially enjoyed track #6 "Let Go" which had a bit of a Parisian feel. I have to admit that the songs "Catwalkin'" and "Superfreak" sounded a bit out of play on a soundtrack filled mostly with melancholy indie pop and instrumentals but I still enjoyed listening to the songs, especially "Superfreak (Rocasound Revamp" by Rick James because I always think of that hilarious scene where Abigail Breslin's character is on stage with her dance routine. Great film, great soundtrack.

I'm not really a big fan of the fantasy genre but every now and then there will be fantasy film that will piqued my curiousity. "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of those films."Pan's Labyrinth" takes place during WWII in 1944 in a rural section in Spain. Ivana Baquero plays the precocious Ofelia who is traveling with her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Ofelia is a big fan of fairy tales. She hides behind her fairy tales to escape the ugliness of reality which is her stepfather is a cruel and ruthless dictator.After moving into her new home, Ofelia is befriended by the kind housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), but more importantly meets Pan (Doug Jones), a faun who lures her into his world. The next thing she knows she is trapped in her own fairy tale. Pan gives Ofelia 3 tasks to perform before the full moon. All three tasks involves a certain level of danger to them and if she doesn't fulfill these tasks there are dire consequences. The sub-plot of the film involves Mercedes and a group of rebels out to bring down the dictatorship of Capitan Vidal and his men. I thought there was a bit too much focus on this aspect of the film but I guess the point is to show how cruel and vicious Capitain Vidal is.I enjoyed this film very much. I really enjoyed the scenes that involved Ofelia performing the three tasks Pan assigns her to do. The second task was my favorite. It was quite hideous. Doug Jones' Pale Man in this particular segment of the film was unforgettable to say the very least because his eyes were in his hands, not on his face. What Pale Man does to children who eats his food is even more gruesome.This film is dark, violent, and occasionally gory but whatcha expect from Guillermo del Toro? A Disney film? I think not. Violence aside, the writing was fantastic. I was quickly engaged in the story right from the get go. The first 20-30 minutes of the film moved a bit too slow for my personal tastes. Eventually the film did pick up pace and the characters quickly became more than one dimensional. The cast gave excellent performances. "Pan's Labyrinth" is a real gem of a film. What a great way to start off the new year.

With Christmas just edging right around the corner, I have been trying to accumulate as many of my favorite versions of classic Christmas caroles for my ipod. Christmas just isn't Christmas without The Chipmunks' squeaking out "The Christmas Song" or Brenda Lee belting out "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree". Thankfully Billboard has my favorite Christmas songs on one cd on their "1955 - 1983 (or "present" as it is noted on the cd packaging). As for the rest of the cd, I liked most of the songs however I can so live without hearing that tiresome novelty track "Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer" which has been satirized one too many times over the years, and the equally obnoxious "Nuttin' For Christmas". Other than those two annoying songs, I enjoyed listening to the cd.

Lately I have been on a '90s kick with Concrete Blonde, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and Belly. Not long ago I picked up a copy of Star by Belly. It has been a decade since I last heard this album. What a real treat hearing Star all over again. The music sounds totally fresh and new for me. I almost forgot how much I loved the super catchy "Dusted". When I had a cassette version of the album back in college, that was one of my favorite songs on the album. My personal fave back in college and still to this very day is "Gepetto". I thought it was a crime that it barely got noticed after the band's hit "Feed the Tree". The song was even more infectious than its predecessor. Whenever I listen to Star, I am often reminded of Mazzy Star with Tonya Donnelly's whispery vocals and the distorted, fuzzy guitar riffs of The Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine. My new favorite song off the album is "Untogether". This track totally reminds me of Mazzy Star. I absolutely adore it. It is a damn shame that Belly got totally written off as a one hit wonder. I am so glad that I bought Star again. The album is a real gem.

I used to love Outburn magazine. I first discovered it when I came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. The first thing I saw on the cover was VNV Nation. I bought that issue and soon after that I ordered a subscription. What I loved about Outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines, namely those in the goth, EBM, synthpop, and industrial scene. Unfortunately within the next year and a half, the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands, two genres I don't give a rat's behind about. I don't know WTF happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth and industrial related and started covering more music I would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to (death metal and emo). Just like Alternative Press, Outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends.

The Namesake is the newest film by Mira Nair who directed Monsoon Wedding and Vanity Fair. The film centers around an Indian family living in New York. The parents Ashoke Ganguli (Irfan Khan) and Ashima Ganguli (Tabu) immigrated to American after their parents arranged to have the couple married. The story begins prior to Ashoke and Ashima's wedding when Ashoke is going to visit his grandfather via a train which ends up in a horrific accident, leaving Ashoke a changed man. For awhile the film focuses on the young couple's life in New York which was obviously a lonely time for Ashima since she did not know anybody in the US. The couple ends up having two children, Gogol and Sonia and they move out into the 'burbs.When Gogol (Kal Penn) gets older, the adolescent angst kicks in especially during high school when his high school peers teases him for his unusual name. This soon leads to his conflict between his parents' traditional Indian heritage and his Americanized upbringing. For awhile Gogol rebels against his parents' Indian roots but when tragedy befalls the family, his Indian roots is awakened through self-realization.The film was excellent. The writing was strong and every compelling. The conflict between America and India in Gogol was very convincing. After seeing this film, I am quite interested in reading the book that this film was based on.Kal Penn is more known for his goofy roles like in National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Harold and Kumar goes to White Castle. I recently saw him on an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit this year in a darker, sinister role. I thought he was quite good as an actor. I hope to see him in roles like Gogol and maybe make less crappy comedy films like Van Wilder.

Up until now I had never heard of Daniel Graves. I saw Daniel open up for De/Vision last month as Necessary Response and absolutely became hooked on his brand of addictively melodic synthpop. BLOOD SPILLS NOT FAR FROM THE WOUND is Necessary Response's first album. The music is addictive. The songs are candy for my ears. As a synthpop fan, I am reminded of two of my favorite synthpop bands De/Vision and Depeche Mode (although a bit more fast-paced). Granted the sound on BLOOD SPILLS... doesn't capture the essence of NR's live performance when I saw by Daniel, overall I love the cd. Songs like "Spilling Bl**d" and "Forever" will make listeners want to dance. There are some lovely ballads too. The album closes with the haunting "Devotion". There isn't a single song on the album that I didn't like. I have to say that you can find a cheaper copy on Metropolis Records' website. It is half of what it costs here on Amazon.com. If you like the sounds of De/Vision, And One, and Depeche Mode, I would definitely recommend checking out Necessary Response.

A recently I came across Cruachan's THE MORRIGAN'S CALL at my local library. I was immediately intrigued by the cover, and by the picture on the backside of the cd case. My initial impression was that this was a celtic band so being a fan of celtic music, I checked out the cd. I wasn't too far off that this band played celtic music however I was quite surprised (in a good way) by the heavy metal riffs. THE MORRIGAN'S CALL is definitely not something I was used to hearing in terms of metal. The fusion of celtic folk and black metal music took some time to grow on me but eventually I grew to enjoy the album. I particularly enjoyed listening to Karen Gilligan sing but could have lived without hearing Keith Fay growl or bark. Keith's vocals kinda ruins the beauty of the band's music for me. I enjoyed most of the songs except for when I hear Keith's singing. Overall THE MORRIGAN'S CALL is a solid folk metal album worth checking out.

Metropolis Records is hands down my favorite record label. Metropolis Records is an indie label based in Pennsylvania whose roster is a mix bag of goth, EBM, synthpop, industrial, and alternative. Every year the label releases a compilation of artists that is signed to the label and released via Hot Topic and they usually sell out pretty quickly. "Metropolis 2004" is one of my favorite in the series. The music ranges from electro-industrial (Velvet Acid Christ)to trance (Cesium 137). Thanks to this particular compilation, I discovered Mono Chrome and Imperative Reaction, my personal favorite of the two. Their music contains solid pop hooks set to high energy dance beats that would surely make anyone want to dance. I also loved the tracks by Assemblage 23, Wumpscut, Icon of Coil, and Informatik. The only tracks I wasn't too keen on was by Punto Omega and Grendel (the music was too repetitious for my liking), otherwise good cd. This is a good introduction to Metropolis Records and their artists. It is definitely worth owning.

If there is one good thing that I can actually say about the film adaptation of Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code", it is by far Hans Zimmer's lush, orchestral film score for the film. I wasn't all that impressed with the film (much less the book itself). The only negative thing I can honestly say about the score is that the music is almost too subtle and quiet which makes it a bit difficult to listen to on one's ipod. A lot of Zimmer's scores tends to be loud and bombastic but surprisingly enough this is not the case with "The Da Vinci Code". There are still occasional bombastic moment but they are few and far between. Regardless of the minor flaws, the soundtrack is laced with a lush tapestry of orchestral melodies and operatic vocals reminiscent of Mediaeval Baebes like on "Salvete Virgines". My personal favorite song on the album is the epic "CheValiers De Sangreal". I just love how dramatic the melody is. I think I would have enjoyed this soundtrack even more so if it was edited slightly to just under an hour. A little over an hour was a bit too long for me but overall great soundtrack.

I'm not a big fan of opera music. I find a lot of it too bombastic for my ears. What little opera music I do listen to is a mixture of pop and opera. Opera Babes help make opera music more palatable to those listeners who are not really opera fans. Their first cd "Beyond Imagination" was pretty good but it also predictable. When classical crossover was quite popular with me back in 2002 - 2003, I often hear the same songs they had on their debut cd on other albums in that genre. Five years later, the women return with their follow up "Renaissance" which is available as an import only.I have to admit I found "Renaissance" to be rather lackluster on the initial listen. The songs are a little more obscure which I have to give the women for choosing songs that haven't been recorded by Celtic Woman, Il Divo, and Josh Groban. The first two songs on "Renaissance" did not do anything for me. I found them rather dull. As much as I hate "Send in the Clowns", I actually enjoyed Opera Babes' version. After "Send in the Clowns" the album actually improves quite a bit. Karen and Rebecca for the most part have definitely refined their vocals for the album. Their vocals are more restrained than on "Beyond Imagination" although there were a couple of tracks on "Renaissance" when I thought I was listening to cats in heat.The more I have listened to "Renaissance", the more the album has grown on me. It is flawed but I like it to give the album 3.5 stars in my book. I just hope the women pick better material for the next album because I really do enjoy their music.

I am a new fan to Anything Box. A friend of mine introduced me to the California band not long ago with their Future Past EP, and now recently with Recovered. I have been listening to Recovered non-stop. For a band that came about in the '90s they have a very distinctive retro '80s synthpop sound that does not sound remotely dated one bit. Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, Book of Love, and early Depeche Mode automatically pops in my head when I listen to Recovered. One of the songs on the album that really stands out with me is the beautiful ballad "The Teardrop Collector". I found the combination of the thoughtful lyrics and lush melodies irresistible. I also really enjoyed "The Great Divide" and "Sunday". Both of those songs have really strong pop hooks. The more I listen to Recovered the more excited I get when I see them next month in Minneapolis at Ground Zero on September 11.

As a fan of anime and vampires, I thought it would be appropriate for me to want to check out chapter one of BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS. The protangonist of the film is Jiro "the silver blade" Mochizuki, a former leader in a holy war that took place in Hong Kong years ago versus a new, mutant form of vampires called the Kowloon Children. "Retired" so to speak, Jiro takes his precocious younger brother Kotaro to the Special Zone where humans and vampires co-exist in peace with the assistance of compromiser Mimiko Katsuragi. Of course the journey to the Special Zone doesn't go without a hitch.BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS CHAPTER 1: BAD TIDINGS contains four episodes. Compared to a lot of anime that I have seen, BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS is fairly tame when it comes to violence and blood. Still I was entertained. All four episodes went by pretty quickly. The storyline didn't really pick up and blossomed until the second and third episodes where a lot of the characters were fleshed out more in the writing. I liked the animation but it wasn't anything that I haven't already seen before. My only other quibble with the movie is that Jiro is your cliched brooding vampire. How many times have I seen or read about a vampire with a tortured soul? Still for its minor flaws, I am looking forward to seeing the other episodes in the BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS series.

Best of/greatest hits compilations are a hit and miss with diehard fans of a particular group or artist. There is always someone who thinks that the artist/band missed a particular song. Then there are artists who will include one too many previously unreleased tracks/b-sides/remixes which detracts the whole concept of greatest hits/best of albums. Neither is the case here on Everything but the Girl's "Like the Deserts Miss the Rain" cd, a compilation of the duo's past hits as well as remixes. "Like the Deserts Miss the Rain" is has everything on this cd that will please most EBTG fans. The flow of the cd is smooth and effortless. This is a perfect cd to listen to on a Sunday morning while drinking a cup of coffee and reading the Sunday paper. The fusion of airy acoustic guitars, laid back trip hop grooves, and Tracey Thorn's warm vocals makes this cd such a joy to listen to. I especially enjoy listening to "My Head is My Only House Unless it Rains", "Rollercoaster" and "Protection". I used to not like the much overplayed Todd Terry remix of "Missing" but I actually can enjoy the song now since I haven't heard it in years. Overall great compilation. The only minor flaw with the album is that I would have liked to have heard a track or two off "Temperamental" otherwise I was not disappointed in it

Of all the bands that I have grown up with since I was a child, The Bangles is one of the few that has stayed with me into my adult years. I recently have bought a ticket for their upcoming fall tour so in preparation I picked up a copy of the band's last studio album (when Michael Steele was still in the band) Doll Revolution (the band's first album since Everything). I used to have the cd years ago but had to sell it for some much needed cash. I am so glad I bought it again. I almost forgot how much I loved the album. I definitely can hear the maturity in the band's songwriting. Like in the '80s, the women all harmonize perfectly together as well as take turns singing lead. I enjoyed all the songs. The bonus dvd is a nice treat for fans of the band. Overall I felt like I got my money's worth. I am so looking forward to seeing the band later this fall.

I never thought in my lifetime that a Japanese anime film would reduce me to tears. Well it has happened. I finally got around to watching Tsutomu Tatsumi's GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES after months of languishing on my queue list on my online dvd rental service. This haunting animated film proves that not all anime needs to be based in fantasy.This bleak story was inspired by the autobiographical novel of the same title by Akiyuki Nosaka who had lost his sister to malnutrition during World War II. In GRAVES OF THE FIREFLIES, the main characters of the film is Seita, the older brother, and Setsuko, the younger sister. It is World War II. Japan is subjected to the frequent air raids by the west. Seita and Setsuko loses their mother to the bombs while their father is in the navy and has not been heard from in awhile. After losing their mother, Seita and Setsuko moves in with their aunt. Their aunt is anything but kind and loving. She views the children as nothing more than financial burdens on her household. She admonishes Seita for not contributing to the househould finances as well as to the country every opportunity she gets. One day, Seita had enough of his aunt's insults, and takes Setsuko to an abandoned bomb shelter. Seita's selfish pride would eventually prove to be his undoing and would lead to tragedy in the end of the film.I loved this film. I was so moved by the imagery and the writing. In a lot of animated films, when someone gets hurt, you don't see the wounds the individual received from his or her attacker but in this film you do, namely with Seita and Setsuko's mother. Their mother was completely unrecognizable in her bandages but you could see the serious wounds by the blood and her facial expression.While the aunt may not have been an angel herself, Seita wasn't exactly perfect himself either. He was selfish by not appreciating the roof and food his aunt provided albeit relunctantly. It never occured to him that he should try to contribute to his aunt's household income given the circumestances that she had two extra mouths to feed. Unfortunately his selfish pride would lead to his downfall when he decides that he and Setsuko would be better off away from his aunt.GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is definitely not a kiddie film for young audiences to see. The story and images are bleak and occasionally graphic. The realism in the storyline was so real and authentic, I was moved to tears especially towards the end of the film. This film gave me a good glimpse of life in Japan during WWII. GRAVES OF THE FIREFLIES is a rare gem in animated films and films in general where I am brought to tears. This is an instant classic with me.

Jenny Dalton is a local singer/songwriter from Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have had the immense pleasure of seeing her perform as well as know her personally. FLEUR DE LILY is Jenny's first album on her own record label Glossy Shoebox Productions. Most of the cd consists of songs from her demo cd she had given out for free at her gigs a couple of years ago. Jenny wears her musical influences on her sleeve and it shows in her music. I am reminded of Tori Amos's first solo album LITTLE EARTHQUAKES throughout Jenny's music. Lyrically, Jenny uses a lot of her personal experiences as her inspiration in her songs. "Iraqi Sky" was inspired by a former boyfriend who is in the military and spent some time in Iraq. "Joshua" is a song about her former boyfriend. My personal favorite Jenny Dalton song is "Three Lilies". That was the first song I have heard from Jenny. I just love how melodic the song is. The main flaw with Jenny's music is that the songs tends to sounds the same. Jenny's vocals are rather limited but so are a lot of my favorite artists. The flaws are minor in comparison to the immense pleasure I get listening to her music. If you like Tori Amos, Kristin Hersh, and Kate Bush's music, you definitely will like Jenny Dalton. She sounds even better live in concert. Catch her if you can

I am not a fan of country music but I will make the exception with Johnny Cash who managed to transcend country music. I didn't really get into him until I heardAmerican IV: The Man Comes Aroundwith his haunting interpretation of Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt". Since then I have made it a point to try to hear all of Johnny's work with Rick Rubin. I have to admit that "American IV" remains my personal favorite. Sadly to say "Unchained". I felt this album was not as strong as the last two albums Johnny did with Rick Rubin however it is not terrible as I might make it to be. I will say that on "Unchained" you can hear that Johnny was in better health. His voice is rich and full of life while the last two albums you can hear Johnny's exhaustion and grief (from the loss of his beloved June Carter Cash). The album does have plenty of songs that I liked. I think Johnny does a marvelous job at covering Soundgarden's "Rusty Cage". Just like "Hurt", he totally turns an alternative rock classic into a Johnny Cash song. Other favorites includes "Sea of Heartbreak", "Memories are Made of This", "Meet Me in Heaven", and "I've Been Everywhere". I wasn't too keen on "Rowboat", "Country Boy", and "I Never Picked Cotton". I just did not enjoy the melodies in those songs. Even though I consider "Unchained" my least favorite Johnny Cash cd w/Rick Rubin, it is still good and certainly a lot better than most country cds that are churned out day in and day out for public mass consumption.

On this three day weekend, I was looking for a movie that I could go see but without having to deal with the crowds at the local mainstream movie theatres. I decided to go see "Paris, je t'aime" when I saw that some of the filmmakers involved in the collection of short films were ones that I admire like Alexander Payne (Sideways), Alfonso Cuaron, and The Coen brothers.There are 18 short films in "Paris, je t'aime", filled with some well known and not so well known actors. The theme of each film revolves around Paris, France and love. Most of the short films worked for me but there were a few clunkers in the collection that seemed totally out of place.I will begin with my favorite segments. The best short film for me is "Place des Victoires" starring Juliette Binoche and William DeFoe as The Cowboy. Juliette Binoche plays Suzanne, a grieving houswife/mother who had just lost her young son named Justin. Her son loved cowboys. With the help of The Cowboy played by the always wonderful William DeFoe, Suzanne is able to come to terms with her son's death.My second favorite short film is Alexander Payne's brutally honest "14 arrondissement". The story is about an American tourist named Carol (Margo Martindale) who tours Paris. At first Margo isn't having such a great time but as the story quickly progresses on Margo finds herself falling in love with Paris. I like the fact that Alexander Payne didn't shoot his film at the most obvious sights like the Eiffel Tower. He opted for places that you usually don't scene in French films.I also enjoyed Natalie Portman in "Fauborg Saint-Denis" about a young American woman attending a Parisian acting school and is dating a blind man. For once, I was actually surprised by the way the story ended. I was totally threw for the loop by the ending.I really enjoyed seeing the short films starring Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Emily Mortimer, Steve Buscemi, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. I thought there short films were very satisfying to watch.The worst segement in the collection has to be "Quartier de la Madelaeine" starring Eliijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko. I love vampire films but this really stunk to high heaven. This short film felt so out of place. I did though love Olga as a vampire. She was stunning. I also did not like "Pigalle" starring Bob Hoskins who plays Bob Leander. He and his wife try to bring back some life into their marriage by acting out a fantasy. That was lame.All in all, I enjoyed "Paris, je t'aime". I normally don't go for films that are a collection of short films but I thought this was well worth the money. It was a nice change of pace from all the overhyped summer blockbuster films.

The Birthday Massacre has to go down as one of the best bands that I have heard in the past decade. Most of 2005 was listening to "Violet". It is simply one of the best cds I have ever heard in my entire life. I didn't think that it was possible for music to be this catchy without being overly produced. I first discovered The Birthday Massacre back in 2004 when I heard "Video Kid" on a Cleopatra Records compilation. I was completely blown away by the combination of hard rock, new wave, and power pop. It wasn't until early last year when I got my hands on the band's re-mastered version of "Violet". The crisp production and the radio-friendly hooks made me a TBM fan right from the get go. The blend of modern hard rock with retro new wave was an immediate smash hit with me. It is hard to pick a favorite track off the cd but "Holiday" and "Violet" are obvious stand outs for me (besides "Video Kid"). The only song I really wasn't crazy about was "Blue" where lead singer Chibi growls through out the music as opposed to singing. Her Cookie Monster on acid vocals didn't work for me. Overall though the band totally rocks. "Violet" remains in heavy rotation in my stereo and computer at work.

I still remember the first time I heard my first Concrete Blonde song. I was heading home on a trip to Montana with my church youth group in 1992 and during the journey I heard the song "Joey". I was so taken by Johnette Napolitano's vocals, sing-a-long vocals, and infectious pop hooks. After I got home from the trip, I went out and bought a cassette version of the album Bloodletting and loved every second of it. After all these years, I can still listen to Bloodletting without getting sick and tired of the music. I love the raw, post-punk sounds of the album like "Caroline" and "Days and Days" as much as the dark, sinister, goth-like sounds of "Bloodletting the Vampire Song" and "The Beast". There is not a single track on the album that I do like. They each have their own charm and character.

I admit, I collect rubber duckies. They are my biggest guilty pleasure. However I don't collect just any rubber ducky. I try to find duckies that are different from your average yellow rubber bathtub toy. Accoutrement makes my favorite line of duckies...the devil duckie. One of my favorite devil duckies is the ninja devil duckie. The duckie itself is a little more stiff than the other devil duckies. To be perfectly honest, a real ninja wouldn't have a ninja star painted on its chest like the ninja duckie has, nor wear a red mask as far as I know but I'm just being picky. Ninja duckie is cool in my book.

I love devil duckies. I have recently started collecting them because they come in so many unique colors and styles. My most beloved devil duckie has to be the tattoed/pierced devil duckie. It is a light tan duckie with a pierced horn and is covered in tattoos. This devil duckie is definitely the coolest with its pierced horn and tattoos. I love the web tattoo on the duckie's behind. On its right cheek is a little devil duckie tattoo with the number 13. Too cute. I think it truly embodies the rebellious spirit of the devil duckie brand. I may be an adult but I am also a kid at heart. Devil duckies aren't your average rubber duckies we all grew up with as kids. I don't think you need to be a kid to collect devil duckies.

What can I say? I am an oddball. I love rubber duckies. The more unusual, the better. My current favorite rubber duckie is the Yin Yang Devil Duckie. The picture of it is pretty self-explainatory. The black and white emblem on the chest of the rubber duckie is the yin yang symbol. Yin Yang comes from Chinese philosophy. Two seemingly opposite natural forces are entwined together. One can't exist or function without the other. In the case of this adorable rubber duckie, the two forces that are intertwined is good and evil according to the description. It is obvious that there is no educational use for this cute little critter but as a rubber duckie collector, he is a must have. He is too cute. If you love the devil duckie line like I do, Yin Yang Devil Duckie is a must have.

Alternative rock band Garbage may not have created the techno/rock sound but they certainly have made it commercially appealing to the masses. After twelve years as band, Shirley, Butch, Duke, and Steve have reached a point of giving the public a greatest hits collection aptly titled ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Is it garbage so to speak? Absolutely no. The single disc collection runs almost 80 minutes long. The cd contains the band's biggest hits as well as one new song ("Tell Me Where It Hurts") and their contributions to a James Bond film ("The World is Not Enough") and the modern version of ROMEO AND JULIET ("#1 Crush"). Most of the songs are from the band's first two albumsGarbageandVersion 2.0. There are at least two tracks fromBeautifulgarbageandBleed Like Me. Maybe because they didn't spawn any major hits like their first two albums. Personally the band should have turned this greatest hits collection into a two disc set and included more songs from those albums.I am glad the band gave their songs a remastering treatment especially the songs from their self-titled album which frankly sounded dreck production-wise. I am also glad they inlcuded "The World is Not Enough" and "#1 Crush". Of all the James Bond songs from the past few years, Garbage's theme song is my personal favorite. Their new song "Tell Me Where It Hurts" is great. I can't help but think how much the song sounds like the theme song to that cheesetastic show THE LOVE BOAT. Despite missing a couple of songs from the band's last two albums, ABSOLUTE GARBAGE is a great compilation of the band's music.

I am by no means a fan of country music. Most of it does not interest me. One of the few artists I love and can proudly admit is Johnny Cash. Johnny has such a wonderfully rich, warm voice that always brings a tear to my eye. I recently came across his last album "American V: A Hundred Highways" at my local library. I didn't think he could outdo "American IV: The Man Who Came Around" but he did with this album. The twelve song album is a haunting reminder of the legendary singer/songwriter. I could hear in his voice that the man in black was coming towards the end of his life. I could hear the weariness in his voice. I mean that in a good way. I think his weariness added an emotional depth to each song that is rarely heard in music nowadays. Rick Rubin did a great job of maintaining an intimate, raw sound to the album. I felt like I was in the studio watching Johnny performing. I loved every song. Johnny sang with such heartfelt conviction that it broke my heart. May the man in black rest in peace. He will always be missed.

I am a big fan of Celtic Woman. Meav is a favorite of mine. Asides from Lisa Kelly, I think Meav has one of the stronger voices in the group. A couple of days ago, I came across Meav's latest solo album and I decided to check it out. A couple of the songs on this album can be heard on Celtic Woman's first dvd and/or cd. The songs are beautiful. Meav's vocals are never overwhelming like some pop divas who are guilty of vocal acrobatics (i.e Celine Dion and Whitney Houston). Meav does two Loreena McKennitt songs "She Moved Through the Fair" and "Dante's Prayer". She does a fairly good job in executing the songs but they don't hold a candle to the original versions, especially "Dante's Prayer". There was not one song on the cd that I did not like. I enjoyed all twelve tracks. This cd is definitely worth listening to for Celtic Woman fans.

I think Buddha Bar puts out the best chill out compilations that I have heard. I have been a fan for several years now. My personal favorite is volume 4, mixed by Dave Visan, son of Raymond Visan founder of the nightclub/restaurant Buddha bar. BUDDHA BAR IV is two cds, disc 1 is the dinner disc and disc 2 is the drink disc. The dinner disc consists of laid back downtempo grooves with a heavy dosage of Asian influences. This is the ideal disc to have in the background while you have friends over for a bite to eat and drink. The music is very relaxing without being cheesy. The drink disc consists of more uptempo songs ideal for you and your friends having an after dinner cocktail before you head out to the clubs for the night. I love both discs equally. Usually with other Buddha Bar compilations, I prefer one disc over the other but not here. I enjoyed all of the songs here. I like how the songs meld effortlessly into a easy going flow. Dave Visan is my favorite mixer in this series. He always finds songs that I would like. It is too bad the most recent Buddha Bar cds have not been all that great. I would stick to the first five volumes (although volume eight is quite good which I would also recommend).

I recently discovered Sylvia Tuson in the past month. Her song "Runaway" can be found on the compilation SIRENES: THE POWER OF THE FEMALE VOICE which was put together by Sleepthief's Justin Elswick and an associate. I immediately fell in love with the lush melodies of the song as well as Sylvia's vocals. Because of the song "Runaway", I bought the EP TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN in which the song can be found on. The cd is only 27 minutes long but it is a nice beginner for me. The music reminded me of Delerium and Sleepthief with its lush pop melodies awashed in gentle electronic beats and subtle acoustic melodies. Sylvia's vocals reminds me of some the women who have collaborated with both Delerium and Sleepthief. Her vocals are polished and goes down very easy. I loved all six songs. The cd always goes by too quickly whenever I listen to it. I definitely plan on trying to get a hold of Sylvia's other cds, past, present, and future. She is an artist who definitely deserves more exposure.

"Lost in Translation" is one of my personal favorite soundtracks from the past five years. The soundtrack consists of an array of modern electronica artists from Air to Squarepusher, with a smidgeon of indie rock by Kevin Shields (of My Bloody Valentine fame) and The Jesus and Mary Chain. The moodiness of songs like Sebastien Tellier's "Fantino" and Air's "Lost in Kyoto" provides the lush, atmospheric soundtrack to the scenes involving Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen. Some people might find this soundtrack bloody boring but I loved it because the music actually made the film what it was. I only wish that Sophia included the song by Peaches from the stripclub scene on the soundtrack but overall the soundtrack is a classic to me. I don't think the film would have been as good with any other music.

Gotta love A Different Drum record label. They really know good quality music that would make a person happy. Every artist from the label I have bought has been nothing but pure joy for me to listen to. The latest album from Nevarakka is no exception. "Soft" picks up where "Color vs. Light" had left off with its infectious dance beats. I wouldn't necessarily label Nevarakka's music as synthpop. IMO it is more trance than synthpop but there definitely are elements of synthpop in the music. The songs are addictive to listen to, namely the tracks that Zandra Lundmark sings on with her child-like vocals. I find myself constantly playing "Dare" and "Super Groovie Style" repeatedly. The sugary pop hooks are irresistable. As dumb as the lyrics are for "Super Groovie Style" are, I have to admit the song has a killer hook and beats.Another favorite song of mine is the gorgeous ballad "Suddenly". It is a nice quiet way to close out the cd.

A year or two ago I was watching CBS Sunday Morning when a music critic (whose name I forgot) raved about YEAR OF METEORS by Laura Veirs. The cd cover of Laura left an impression on me because I recently found that particular cd last weekend, and I decided to check it out on a whim. Normally I listen to goth and industrial music so YEAR OF THE METEORS is the antithesis of the kind of music I listen to on a regular basis. It is difficult for me to categorize Laura's music because she takes elements of folk, electronica, and indie rock and fuse them together. It is an interesting combination. The songs took some time to grow on me but the more I listened to YEAR OF METEORS the more I enjoyed the songs. This is the sort of stuff I could hear on a mix tape or a soundtrack similiar to GARDEN STATE. The only thing that I wasn't too terribly wild about is Laura's limited vocals. I didn't mind it so much except like on "Secret Someones" but other than her voice, the cd is nice to listen to while relaxing.

Tiesto is the only trance dj that I really listen to nowadays. Everyone else just bores me because the genre has gotten rather stale and repetitive. I finally got the opportunity to hear ELEMENTS OF LIFE which is not a mixed cd but a cd filled with original compositions. I have to say that the album does nothing for me. I found tracks like "Do You Feel Me?" and "Carpe Noctum" (well the first couple of minutes into the song) annoyingly repetitive and boring all around. What the heck happened? His first album of original songs JUST BE was really good but ELEMENTS OF LIFE was a big let down for me. The first three songs on the album showed a lot of promise but after "Do You Feel Me?", the quality in the music went downhill for me. I felt like I was listening to the same bloody song for most of the album. My two favorite tracks on the cd are "Everything" and "Driving to Heaven" which includes female vocals. After hearing ELEMENTS OF LIFE, I have no desire of hearing another original album by Tiesto or anything in the trance genre.

It has almost been two years ago when I first saw Imperative Reaction open up for VNV Nation. I was completely blown away by their live show. At the time I had only known them by one song "Giving in to the Change" from their "Redemption" cd. Their performance definitely made me an IE fan. "Redemption" was good but the cd had a couple of filler tracks. I finally got around to buying the latest Imperative Reaction cd "As We Fall". I definitely found "As We Fall" much more compelling. The dance beats are much more aggressive. The beats are more in your face than on "Redemption". The songs are definitely more melodic than on the previous album. I can't help but notice how similiar the song "Judas" is to the title track to "Redemption" both melody wise and Ted Phelps' vocals. That is where the band's weakness rears its ugly head. Their songs tend to sound the same but oeverall I enjoyed "As We Fall" immensely.

As a long time fan of KMFDM, I have pretty much heard most of the band's music but there are a few albums that I have still haven't heard. NAIVE is one of the KMFDM cds I haven't heard until now. I have heard a few tracks from NAIVE from the group's RETRO cd. I hate saying this but no matter how many times I have listened to NAIVE, I just couldn't get into the music as much as I have with the band's other albums (past and present). It is a shame that copywrite issues forced Sascha to remove the "O Fortuna" sample off from "Liebesleid". Thankfully I have the original version on the RETRO cd so not all is totally lost. The few songs that I do enjoy listening is "Go to H*ll", "Godlike", and "Virus". Think in lieu of the current climate in this world, those songs are rather appropo. As for the remixes, I enjoyed the remixes to "Go to H*ll" and "Virus" but wasn't really into the other remixes. As a big KMFDM fan, I wish I could have liked this album more but I just couldn't. There were some good songs but the overall sound just didn't do anything for me.

Trance music has become pretty predictable nowadays. There isn't anything that sounds remotely fresh or at least exciting. Thankfully A Different Drum records has been putting out some of the best trance music for the last couple of years. One of those artists is Cosmic Ally, who is from Korea. Cosmic Ally's music is a melodic blend of trance and synthpop. The songs are irresistably catchy and very dance friendly. The music often reminds me of ATB and 4 Strings. The beats share that familiar crisp synthesized beats that is usually heard on most trance albums. The lyrics are all sung in Korean but I like it that way. I think the Korean vocals gives the music a more interesting sound. The songs that really stood out with me were "Just a Dream", "Never", "Dear My Friend", and Nevarakka's mix of "Dear My Friend". The melodies were simply unfortgettable. They just stuck in my head. I will have to say that I wasn't fond of the remix of "Paranoid". I didn't like the melodies and the beats. Otherwise Cosmic Ally's "Twin Sun" is a fantastic trance cd. I found the dance beats and lyrics (even if I don't understand a lick of Korean) very uplifting.

THE MASK AND MIRROR is the very first compact disc that I bought. I was a senior in high school when I bought it. I fell in love with Loreena McKennitt's music when I first heard "All Soul's Night" on a local radio station which has totally been hijacked by the commercialization of Clear Channel. At the time I couldn't find THE VISIT which the song could be found on, I opted for THE MASK AND MIRROR and since then I have been an avid fan of Loreena's music.On THE MASK AND MIRROR, Loreena takes her listeners on a journey through Spain and Morocco. It is evident in the sumptuous melodies. The songs themselves is mostly composed by Loreena herself but she does adapt the occasional poem/story and turn it into a beautiful song. One of my personal favorite songs by Loreena is "The Bonny Swans". It is a traditional tale of a young woman who is about to get married who ends up being pushed into the river by her own sister over a man, and eventually drowns. The young woman first comes back as a swan and then as a harp. Looking back at it now, the song is rather morbid even for Loreena's brand of music but it is a beautiful song that I never get tired of listening to. Another wonderful song that I love is "Santiago". It just has Loreena McKennitt vocalizing but it is a great song. I fell in love with the song even more so when I saw her on last year's PBS special. I love the uptempo beat the song has. It always gets my toes tapping. The ballads "The Dark Night of the Soul" and "Full Circle" sends chills down my spine with their gentle melodies and haunting lyrics.After fourteen years since its release, I am amazed how well THE MASK AND MIRROR has aged well. The music remains a timeless fixture for me on my stereo as well as my ipod. Loreena's legacy will be that she created beautiful music to be enjoyed by everyone of all ages

I am an avid rubber ducky fan and collector. One of my personal favorite rubber duckies is Scream celebriducky. Obviously Scream was inspired by the horror film trilogy Scream movies. There is no educational value. This ducky was simply intended for pure enjoyment. Scream is very sturdy as are all the duckies in the Celebriducks series. Scream's face and hands glows in the dark. It is a lot of fun holding him up to the lamp and then turning the lamp off to see the duck glow in the dark. Scream is one ducky that rubber ducky aficiandos should own.

"Auf Deinen Schwingen" is the new album from Austrian band L'Ame Immortelle. I have been a big fan of the band for the last 3-4 years. I was hooked on them the second I heard "The Truth Behind" on a Cleopatra Records compilation, since then I have been buying their music. Unfortunately L'Ame Immortelle's music isn't readily found in American record stores or cheap. I was fortunate today to have found the band's new cd "Auf Deinen Schwingen" at my local used cd store. I was so not disappointed in what I heard. The most noticeable quality about the cd is that it has a more rock orientated sound than the band's previous cds. Surprisingly enough the rock influence works. I wish there was another "Kingdom" or "The Truth Behind" with their catchy dance beats but beggers can't be choosers. Programmer Thomas Rainer sings on quite a few songs through out the album. In the past, Thomas would sing on one or two tracks. I liked what he had to offer as a vocalist. Sonja still sounds amazingly beautiful especially on the ballads. "Last Will" continues where "Fallen Angel" leaves off when it comes to ballads. The song stirred my soul. The cd I bought included two bonus tracks "Dying Day" and "Dein Her2". There was not one song on the entire cd I did not like. L'Ame Immortelle can never disappoint me.

I can't pretend and say that I am diehard FLA fan. I am definitely an admirer of the work I have heard by Bill, Rhys, and Chris. Of the few FLA albums I have heard, IMPLODE is easily my personal favorite. When I think of industrial music, IMPLODE immediately comes to my mind with its nihilistic lyrics, distorted vocals, and cold, abrasive dance beats. The atmospheric elements of the music reminds me a lot of Bill and Rhys' very early work as Delerium, when they were making dark, ambient music for Cleopatra Records. The only difference is the addition of the abrasive industrial beats. The melodies are more subtle than what one would hear on say a KMFDM album but they are there. I have to admit that IMPLODE took some time to grow on me but eventually I grew to love the music.

I am a longtime fan of Erasure. I have loved them since the '80s. I finally got around to hearing the group's acoustic album "Union Street". The group gave fans a teaser a couple of years ago as b-sides to one of their singles and I loved what I heard. It was a different side to my favorite pop group. I was so pleased they would try to explore that acoustic sound with a full length album on "Union Street".Initially I was hoping Andy and Vince would include "Oh L'Amour" and "Always" for "Union Street" but instead the duo wisely chose songs that were less popular (for the masses). After hearing "Union Street" the first time, I was pleased that they chose songs like "Alien" and "Boy" instead of their bigger hits. Hearing these songs with an acoustic makeover is certainly different than what one would expect but I personally loved this different side of Erasure.

I am not a huge fan of the Indigo Girls but I certainly do like a lot of their songs. I remember listening to their songs in the car whenever I was with my brother as a teenager. He would often throw in the duo's first albumIndigo Girls. I always loved listening to their song "Closer to Fine" and I still do to this very day. OTher favorite songs includes songs from their albumRites of Passage. That was a main staple of mine during my freshman year in college. Since I am more of a casual fan, "Retrospective" is perfect for me. The album consists of all of my personal favorite Indigo Girls songs. It is good road music to listen to during the summer.

I am a huge fan of Toni Halliday and her work with the grossly underrated band Curve. Not too long ago I came across on youtube a video for her song "Time Turns Around". I immediately fell in love with the song. The song is so irresistable with its infectious pop hooks. I knew I had to have the song and the album it was on. Thank heavens I found a copy of Toni's solo album HEARTS AND HANDSHAKES. The album is quite a contrast from Toni's work with Curve. The music on HEARTS AND HANDSHAKES is very new wave with its polished pop hooks and crisp synthesized beats. I was reminded a bit of another '80s act 'Til Tuesday except with a different singer. Toni sounds as great then as she did when she was with Curve. I have to admit there were a couple of songs on the album I wasn't too keen on because of the melodies but overall I do think the album is still worth five stars. Songs like "Time Turns Around" and "Love Attraction" makes me forgive for the blandness of "Cut Up" and "Make a Wish". HEARTS AND HANDSHAKES is worth owning for fans of Toni Halliday. It is great to hear what she was doing before Curve.

If you are familiar with Combichrist, you would know that Icon of Coil is Andy Laplegua's other band. Icon of Coil is alot more polished than Combichrist's music but still as catchy and aggressive. It was through IoC I was introduced to Combichrist. Of all the IoC albums I have bought and/or heard, SERENITY IS THE DEVIL remains my personal favorite IoC cd. I recently bought another copy of the cd after having sold it 3-4 years ago. The music remains as fresh and exciting for me as it was when I first heard the album. For me what makes this album so memorable is the infectious pop hooks and pulsating dance beats. All of the songs are driven by a throbbing bassline that will make anyone want to get up and dance. The lyrics are reminscent of VNV Nation and Apoptygma Berzerk. There is lots of angst, joy, sorrow, and regret. Andy's familiar vocals are here but slicker. The only quibble I have with the album is repetition music wise as well as Andy's vocals but it all depends on what sort of mood I am in otherwise I love the cd. SERENITY IS THE DEVIL remains a classic EBM album in my cd collection.

The Cure is one of the rare few bands that has been around for twenty some years and not look or sound like some outdated dinosaur like every hair metal band who are trying to resurrect their sagging careers in recent years. One of my all time favorite albums is by The Cure (i.e DISINTEGRATION). I am finally getting around to check out the band's other albums, prior and after DISINTEGRATION.KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is my first foray into the band's past. Having loved PORNOGRAPHY, DISINTREGATION, and BLOODFLOWERS so much, it was a bit hard for me to letting go of the band's dark, atmospheric sounds on those albums but I eventually did. KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is am unforgettable mix of post punk, pop, and hints of goth. The version I have is the original recording so the production value is awful. I like how diverse KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is from the post-punk sounds of the opening track "The Kiss" to the Middle Eastern-tinged "If Only Tonight We Could Sleep". My only other quibble with the cd is that it is a little long for my tastes. Songs like "The Snakepit" (one of my least favorite tracks) could have been edited down to three and a half minutes as opposed to over six minutes of incessant droning. For all its minor flaws, KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME is still a great piece of work by one of the greatest bands ever to walk the face of the earth...The Cure. This album is definitely worth checking out for new fans of The Cure.

Last month I was looking for a new and larger home for my red VT Betta Anubis. His one gallon tank wasn't cutting it because of the fact that it was too small and the Hydor mini heater I bought for him heated up his tank too quickly. I decided on another Kritter Keeper because my crowntail Betta Osiris. Unfortunately I couldn't remember which size I had bought for Osiris so I decided on a large Kritter Keeper for Anubis.There are no handles on the top of the lid on the large Kritter Keeper. That is fine. When I do my water changes on Osiris's tank, I pick up the Kritter Keeper by the body, not by the handles. I like the fact that on all Kritter Keepers there is a hole that allows me to put the cord to my mini heaters on each tank. That is quite helpful. Like all Kritter Keepers, it is nice to have a cover for the tank with a lid because Betta fish are notorious jumpers. I also like how the tank does not get easily heated it up by my heaters. With all the room that Anubis has now, I plan on adding a couple more decorations to his tank. He loves his new home as does his mother ;).

I recently bought a second crowntail Betta named Osiris as a next door neighbor for my red veiltail Betta Anubis. At the time, I only had a half gallon bowl to house Osiris. I knew it was only going to be a temporary home for Osiris. As a Betta lover, I would never house my fish in anything less than a gallon permanently. Unfortunately I do not have that much room in my tiny one bedroom apartment myself so I thought the medium Kritter Keeper would be ideal for Osiris. With the addition of blue gravel and a few plastic plants, my Betta is now thriving in his new home. He has lots of room to swim around which is a vast improvement from that dinky plastic bowl I had kept him in, or the plastic cup he was in at the pet store where I bought him. As for changing his water, I never pick up the tank by the handle. It is best to carry it by the tank itself. As someone who lives by herself in a small one bedroom apartment with not a lot of surface space with two male Bettas, I certainly can recommend the Kritter Keeper for people in similiar situations who owns Bettas. Osiris loves his new home. He has already blown a bubble nest in it.

Not long ago I had picked up a copy of 10,000 Maniacs' Our Time in Eden at my favorite record store. I hadn't heard this album in at least a decade, maybe even more. What sweet music it was to hear Our Time in Eden. I loved this album in high school and I still love it to this very day. Natalie Merchant's lyrics reads like poetry and the music provided by the band is how pop music should sound like with real instruments that creates music that has an organic, natural sound to it. For an album that is twenty years old, the music still sounds fresh to my aging ears. I am glad that I picked up Our Time In Eden. The music brings back fond music of my youth.

I have been a Sarah McLachlan for over a decade now beginning with her first albumTouch. I have always loved her gentle vocals and introspective lyrics. I recently got around to hearing her Christmas albumWintersong. While I do like the cd a lot, I have to admit I had to listen to it a few times to get used to Sarah's take on songs like "What Child is This?" and "The First Noel/Mary Mary". Initially I wasn't really wild about the melodies to those songs but after several listens, I grew to love them. My favorite track has to be Sarah's haunting cover of John Lennon's "Happy Xmas (War is Over)". I always loved the music and the lyrics. Sarah's gentle vocals compliments the song very well. I also enjoyed the new tracks "River" and "Wintersong". Even though WINTERSONG is a Christmas album, I do like listening to it after work. I find the music very soothing to listen to. This album is a must have for Sarah fans I think.

I love Christmas music. I love downtempo music. Who would have thought of combining traditional Christmas music with modern, chic downtempo music? I recently discovered THE REINDEER ROOM Vol. II this week. It is a fusion of chillout music and traditional Christmas music. The results gives a unique twist on holiday music. I have to admit it was a bit of a shock to hear my favorite Xmas songs re-interpretated into slick, modern downtempo music perfect to play while sipping on my favorite martini. The songs sounded different but I totally dug what I heard. I never heard of any of the artists on this compilation. Despite the lack of name recognition, the artists did a wonderful job at tweaking at traditional Christmas classics like "Good King Wencelas" and "She Won't Be Home". There are quite a few instrumentals as well as songs with vocals. I particularly enjoyed the songs that included Nicole Henry and Harmony on vocals. No matter what time of year it is, THE REINDEER ROOM VOL. II is great to relax tol

Blaqk Audio is the electronica side project by AFI's Davey Havok and Jade Puget. I admit I am not a fan of AFI's music. I like a couple of their songs here and there but overall I am not a fan. When I first heard samples of Blaqk Audio last year I was totally blown away by what I hear. Their music was definitely right up my alley. CEX CELLS is the duo's first (and hopefully not their last) album. The music reminded me a lot of my favorite EBM and synthpop bands. I found the music very upbeat and addictively catchy. I especially love the opening track "Stiff Kittens" which is a lot of fun to dance too. I also enjoy "Snuff on Digital" as well. The only drawback is Davey's vocals which has a tendency to be nasally and that isn't a good thing. The lyrics are often silly but overall I enjoyed CEX CELLS a lot. I hope Blaqk Audio isn't a one album project. They definitely have the potential of being really great right up there with VNV Nation and Depeche Mode.

I rarely buy Christmas music. I hear a lot it every where I go in public so why buy any? Well this year I have made a couple of exceptions. One being the Celtic Woman Christmas cd and the other Andre Rieu's "Christmas Around the World". Thanks to PBS and its annual pledge drive, I caught the latest Andre Rieu tv special and for once just fell in love with the music. Normally I don't really pay much attention to Andre's specials or his music but this was that rare occasion where the music just blew my mind away. A lot of the credit goes to the adorable Japanese children choir The Little Angels of Nagasaki who simply captured my heart. The other reason I bought "Christmas Around the World" was the gorgeous ballad "Slumber, MY Darling". I found the song to be emotionally moving. I also love "O Holy Night", one of my all time favorite Christmas caroles. Not everyone can sing this song correctly since it has some high notes. The only duds on this cd was "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Winter Wonderland", two songs that sounded flat as well as bland. Overall "Christmas Around the World" is a delightful album to listen to.

I have to admit, I never saw the film WALK THE LINE, the story of Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter Cash. I checked out the soundtrack recently when I had the opportunity to. I wanted to hear how Joaquin Phoenix did as a singer on Johnny Cash's music. Much to my surprise and delight, I thought Joaquin did a wonderful job. Although the intentions were never to try to imitate Johnny and June's vocals, both Joaquin and Reese Witherspoon captured the essence of the two late singers both vocally and spiritually. I thought I was listening to Johnny Cash when Joaquin was singing. I really loved listening to him sing "Ring of Fire" (my all time favorite Johnny Cash song). I really wasn't crazy about "Cocaine" or "Jackson" but that has nothing to do with the actors singing those songs but rather that I never really cared much for those particular songs in general. I also wasn't big on the songs that weren't sung by Joaquin or Reese. "You're My Baby" sounded like it would have been perfect for Elvis Presley. It wasn't terrible but I think it would have been better if Joaquin had sung the track (as well as the other tracks that were sung by other artists). Despite a few clunkers, I liked the soundtrack overall.

I am not a fan of M.Night Shyamalan's films. I am though a fan of the composer he turns to for his films, James Newton Howard. Since I loved his work for that dreadful film "The Village", I had to hear James' latest work for the film "Lady in the Water". I was so not disappointed in what I heard. The orchestral score reminded me a great deal of his work on "The Village". It had that same essence of innocence, mysticism, danger, suspense, and melodrama. The last four tracks on the cd are Bob Dylan cover songs. I absolutely hated Silvertide's versions of "Maggie's Farm" and "It Ain't Me Babe", not so because I like the original versions (which I don't because I am not a Bob Dylan fan) but because I find Silvertide to be an extremely annoying knock off of The Black Crowes. Talk about nails on chalkboard. The singer is hideously awful. I did though love the haunting cover of "The Times They are a-Changin'" by A Whisper in the Noise and Amanda Ghost's version of "Every Grain of Sand". A Whisper in the Noise's cover was so beautifully well sung. Same with the Amanda Ghost's Bob Dylan cover. Despite the Silvertide tracks, "Lady in the Water" soundtrack is an exquisite reminder of James Newton Howard's talent.

I was doing a little record shopping today when I came across Melodica by Frost. I used to own a copy of the cd several years ago but sold it for much needed cash. I decided to buy it because I really missed hearing their brand of trip hop music. Frost consists of Aggie E. Peterson and Per Martinsen. I first heard of Frost on a Paul Oakenfold compilation with their song "Amygdala". After hearing the album for the first time in seven years, I was struck by how much Frost's music reminded me ofMelankton. Melodica and Melankton shares the same slick, icy, seductive trip hop beats and Bjork-influenced vocals. All of the songs still sounds fresh and invigorating to me as I first heard it back in 2003. I certainly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys trip hop music as much as I do.

I am a very new fan to Alphaville. I recently bought a copy of Salvation via Metropolis Records when they had their summer sale. I had heard some of their songs on youtube and had to buy the album. I have been listening to the album a lot. Since I have been listening to a lot of synthpop lately, Salvation was definitely an album I could sink my teeth into. The songs are upbeat and loaded with catchy pop hooks. What more can anyone ask for with this type of music? I really love Marian Gold's vocals. His vocals has a sweet, melancholy quality to it, kinda like in the vein of Pet Shop Boys and Erasure. I love all the tracks on the album. Salvation is just a really charming synthpop album. The music does not sound dated at all for me. I am definitely going to have to check out the group's other albums. I am definitely a converted fan.

Being a long time fan of world music, I was looking for something different outside of Asian, Indian, Parisian, and Latin music. I immediately found what I was looking for in PUTUMAYO PRESENTS GREECE: A MUSICAL ODYSSEY. I am new to music from Greece (I don't count Yanni since his music bores me, nor is it remotely Greecian). I absolutely love this compilation from Putumayo. The music is unquestionably infectious. I love humming along to Anastasia Moutsatsou's "Pino Pino". Although I do not know what the artists are singing, I get a lot of enjoyment out of listening to them sing in their native tongue. I also love listening to the traditional instruments. It is so nice to listen to instruments I don't hear in the music I listen to on a regular basis. Putumayo put together a wonderful collection here as well as on other compilations I have heard. I have yet to hear a Putumayo compilation that I did not like.

Mexico is probably the last country one would turn to for the lastest in goth, EBM, and industrial music but there is a burgeoning goth/EBM/industrial scene in Mexico. Their latest export is the trio Amduscia. The band recently made their US debut with the excellent "From Abuse to Apostasy" via Metropolis Records (home to some of the biggest names in goth, EBM, and industrial music). Amduscia combines the pop melodies of trance and EBM with Polo's gruff vocals. It takes a few listens to get used to the Polo's unpolished vocals but the crisp melodic synth beats makes up for what is lacking in Polo's vocals. Polo's vocals is vaguely similar to Velvet Acid Christ's Bryan Erickson. All of the songs are sung in spanish but the energy in the music is invigorating. The energy never slows down. "From Abuse to Apostasy" is easily one of the best releases from Metropolis Records to come out this year. I look forward to hearing more from Amdusica.

I bought this vase today at my local major pet retail chain. I was looking to replace a bridge for my betta fish Khufu (the paint on four ends of the bridge was falling off). I didn't see any other bridges so I opted for this vase. I must say I like this vase better than a bridge and apparently so does Khufu. He pretty much took to the vase right away. Usually it takes a day or two for my bettas to figure out the purpose of the ornament I place into their tanks. I think it is really adorable seeing my boy Khufu swim in and out of his vase, and it is even cuter when I see his cute face sticking out of the top of the vase. I am glad I bought this vase for my betta fish. It has proven to a source of amusement for him. If there is one thing I have learned from my bettas, they love swimming in and out of things like vases. It alleviates their boredom in captivity.

I recently came across Distorted Reality's music on the internet. After hearing a few samples of their songs, I decided to get their cd "Daydreams and Nightmares". I have to admit that I was not completely impressed with what I heard. First of all, I don't like it when bands tack on remixes. That should be kept completely separate for another cd. The remixes on "Daydreams and Nightmares" were generic as generic gets. I was not impressed. Secondly was it really necessary to include the live mix of "Rebel Yell"? Sorry but that should not have been recorded at all. The first ten songs are original tracks. Some were pretty good. I really dug"Get a Clue" and "Forever". Great overall club songs to dance to. The only ballad I liked on the cd was "I Am Waiting". The other ballads were boring and lifeless. As for the duo's cover of Billy Idol's "Rebel Yell", nothing beats the original. The production on the cd was pretty shoddy. I hope for the next album, the band doesn't include remixes and they pick up the pace on the songs. The beats were too slow for me on a lot of the songs. Here's hoping for improvement.

I could have easily have lived without the guest appearances. I can't really say I am a diehard FLA fan but I certainly have always admired the band from afar. "Implode" is without a shadow of a doubt my favorite FLA cd. I haven't been too crazy about the band's albums in recent years until "Artificial Soldier". After that huge misstep with "Civilization", "Artificial Soldier" definitely brings FLA back to the fore front of industrial music. I do though wish that the songs with Eskil Simonsson and Jean-Luc De Meyer were left out. Their songs weren't terrible by all means but they certainly weren't the strongest songs. "Future Fail" is rather cheesy with the big stompy beats and equally cheesy lyrics. The rest of the album is good, especially Bill Leeb's songs. His distorted vocals reminded me of "Implode". Despite the guest appearances, "Artificial Soldier" is a solid FLA cd in my book.

I am new to Ayria's music. I first heard her music through the internet and was hooked. It is a rarity in the EBM genre to see a woman take front and center stage which is what Jennifer Parkin does here with Ayria. "Flicker" is the second album from Ayria. Her music is a diverse mix of EBM, electro, synthpop, and electro-clash. "Flicker" kicks off with the highly energetic "It's Been Fun". "Counterblow" slows down a bit but not too much. It is a dark, electro track. Very cool track. The stand out track here on the cd is the irresistably catchy "My Revenge On the World". It would be hard not to fall in love with this song. Jennifer successfully combines aggressive electro beats with addictive pop hooks and creates one of the catchiest songs ever heard in electronic music. I find myself constantly singing along to the song every time I listen to it. I think Jennifer's strength is the uptempo songs. I didn't think the slower tracks were all that hot. They weren't terrible but they lack the energy that made me love "It's Been Fun" and "My Revenge On the World". Neverthless "Flicker" is a lot of fun to listen to. It certainly made me a fan out of Ayria.

I have to admit I am not a diehard fan of Morrissey and The Smiths but I do like a good deal of their music, particularly The Smiths. The Smiths' BEST OF...Vol. 1 is ideal for a casual listener like myself. I love all of the songs on the album. The songs are chockful of catchy pop hooks without sounding disgustingly syrupy. I love Morrissey's distinctive vocals. That is what makes The Smiths' music stands out so much from their peers back in the post punk era of the '80s. My favorite Smiths song has to be "Girlfriend in a Coma". "Girlfriend in a Coma" is two minutes of pure pop bliss. I am also a big fan of "How Soon is Now" which is a pretty popular song to cover. Very few artists can match the original version. Every song on the cd is a gem. Alternative music today doesn't hold a candle to bands like The Smiths.

I am a new fan to the swedish futurepop/synthpop/EBM group Colony 5. I recently started listening to their music online via youtube and immediately became hooked on their infectious brand of synthpop. I decided to download their best of collection Colonisation as a good starting point for me. Another reason I downloaded the album was for the song "My World" which has quickly become one of my personal favorite Colony 5 songs. The song is very catchy and gets stuck in my head very easily. "Hate" is another personal favorite song of mine. I totally dig the beats and the melodies. All of the songs on the album are great. I definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys modern synthpop/futurepop to check out Colony 5.

Before Geraldo became one of the sheep at Fox News, he had a pretty entertaining talk show back in the late '80s. One of my personal favorite episodes involved the all female metal band Cycle S***s From H**l. Thanks to their guest appearance(s) on his cheesy talk show, I went out and bought their self titled album. It was good loud, cheesy heavy metal. I had to buy two cassettes overall because one got stolen. Unfortunately I accidently sold the second cassette. Almost two decades later, I found their album at my local record store in the used section and I immediately bought. Despite the fact that the women didn't play any instruments, the women did possess some serious attitude as well as powerful vocals. The lyrics are over the top and hilarious but fun nevertheless. It is a shame that this band only put out one album. I always felt they were viewed as a novelty act despite the fact that these women could sing quite well. Whenever I need to put out a smile on my face, I will throw the album into my stereo and crank up the volume.

I am a movie buff. I like to venture into different genres that I normally don't watch on a regular basis. I don't watch a heckuvalot of films in the GLBT genre but every now and then I will find one that catches my attention. I recently saw the film "Loving Annabelle" starring Erin Kelly as the rebellious and passionate Annabelle and Diane Gaidry as the kind but guarded Simone. Simone is a teacher at a all girls Catholic boarding school. Annabelle is the daughter of a powerful senator who is sent to Simone's school after being expelled from the last school she attended. Annabelle winds up being in Simone's poetry class. Initially the two women clash but eventually their personality differences are tempered when they begin to get to know each other better. Eventually the women's friendship goes beyond platonic which leads to the issue of teacher/student relationship. Instead of making Simone look like a sexual predator, director Katherine Brooks portrays Simone in a more sympathetic light. Simone is plagued with guilt for developing strong romantic feelings for Annabelle.I loved "Loving Annabelle" immensely. The writing was strong. The dialogue was not remotely corny as a lot of gay themed films are unfortunately plagued with. I loved both actresses Erin Kelly and Diane Gaidry. My only gripe with the film was the ending but that was out of Katherine Brooks' control and had no choice to really end the film the way that it did. The alternative wasn't any better. It was vague and short otherwise loved the film.

I have been a big fan of the Buddha Bar series for the last several years. I started out with volume 5 and was immediately hooked. I loved the blend of Asian and modern dance music. The only problem with the Buddha Bar series is the price. They aren't cheap. I have been lucky to have found used (but in perfect condition) copies of the last couple of volumes. What I like about the Buddha Bar series is the music selection. This is not your standard chill out cd with your usual Zero 7, Sarah McLachlan, Delerium, Moby, and Chicane tracks. The Buddha Bar series uses a diverse mix of artists from all over the world.It is difficult for me to choose a favorite Buddha Bar compilation. I will say the first volume holds a special place in my heart. The first disc Buddha's Dinner is absolutely gorgeous. The mood is more laid back, the perfect accompaniment to a dinner party. The second disc Buddha's Party is a more dance orientated disc. As much as I don't like "All By Myself" (the Celine Dion version which is drippy and oversung), I definitely like the dance version by So Emotional. I also love Faithless' operatic "Drifting Away". Both discs are stellar. I like the mixing because it is subtle to a point where the songs flows into one another without overlapping each other.As I have said before, the only problem with this series is the price. If you are a diehard music fanatic like I am and enjoy music from every corner of the world, "Buddha Bar" is definitely worth the investment. If not, go find some Buddha Bar rip off that is cheaper but not as good.

I first discovered Diva Destruction four years ago when I came across the band's second album "Exposing the Sickness" at a local record store. I was immediately hooked. I eventually bought DD's first cd "Passion's Price". I have to say that "Passion's Price" is my favorite DD cd (until whenever the new cd "Run Cold" comes out)."Passion Price" kicks off with the most excellent "The Broken Ones". I just love the throbbing bass lines. I love Debra Fogarty's unusual vocal stylings. She reminds me a bit of Siouxsie Sioux in general. The song is followed up by the evocative "In Dreaming". It's a nice contrast to "The Broken Ones". The beats are slowed down a bit."Enslaved" is another great track. It is my other personal favorite song next to "The Broken Ones". I absolutely love the arrangements on the song. The crisp synthesized melodies and pulsating bass lines compliments Debra's vocals. Personally I like "Snake". I don't see what the big deal is over that song. Just in general, I love this entire cd. It is one of my personal favorite goth albums of all time.

Due to confusion, I thought this was a new Era cd but it turns out "Era" is the name of the album by the duo In the Nursery. The music is a bit dreary and monotonous. Still I wasn't ready to give up on the cd just yet. After a few more listens, the music eventually began to grow on me. There is a dark, ambient influence, almost a more sinister sound especially on "Silent in Time". I wasn't really too fond of that particular track especially the vocals by Klive Humberstone. Sarah Jay Hawley who has worked with Massive Attack in the past contributes to a few tracks on the album. Her fragile vocals complements the sparse electronic melodies especially on "Tempered Wings". I really love her whispery vocals on the sumptuous orchestral track "Vantage". "Era" is a good cd but there is nothing here that I haven't already heard before in ambient music. Another thing I didn't care much for this cd was that I could not upload it on to my itunes library for the library.

A year ago I discovered Imperia on one of the social networking sites I belong to. I am a big fan of gothic metal music fronted by women. I certainly liked what I heard from the samples I had heard. Not too long ago I finally got around to buying their latest album QUEEN OF LIGHT. For the most part, QUEEN OF LIGHT is a solid gothic metal album. Solid drumming, heavy basslines, aggressive guitar riffs, and big operatic vocals from Helena Michaelsen. Unfortunately what bogs down the album is: a) silly lyrics, and b) the oversinging by Helena. Now I am not expecting Shakespeare type lyrics but I certainly don't want to hear such atrocious dreck like "R*ped by the Devil". I would expect that garbage from bands like Cradle of Filth and Children of Bodom. The lyrics for "Missing You" is pretentious as heck. Then there is Helena's vocals. She tends to overdo it for me. Personally she pales in comparison to ex-Nightwish singer Tarja Turunen. Her vocals really irks me on "The Calling" which I equate it to nails on a chalkboard. My personal favorite song on the entire album is "Facing Reality". The pop hooks in that song is super catchy. I also like "Mirror", and "Broken Wings". Although I have given this album four stars, I feel like it is more worthy of 3.5 stars. The material was 50/50 with me. QUEEN OF LIGHT has its moments but unfortunately it has its fair share of flaws.

Once again youtube introduced me to another great musical find called All My Faith Lost. All My Faith Lost is an Italian group comprised of Federico, Viola, and Fabio. I would classify their music as neo-classical/goth/darkwave. Their music is absolutely breathtaking to say the very least. I decided to make As You're Vanishing in Silence my first All My Faith Lost album. What a great introduction to the talented trio from Italy. I was often reminded of Mazzy Star, Ashram, Lycia, and old Black Tape for a Blue Girl. The music is so relaxing, I could easily fall asleep to it. I definitely recommend checking out All My Faith Lost if you dig the sounds of the aforementioned artists.

I can't believe that it has been 15 years since Karma first came out. I was first introduced to Delerium and this particular album by a former roommate over a decade ago. Karma is what got me into Delerium to begin with. I recently bought the album again because I had missed listening to it. While I am still bit worn out from hearing "Silence" (because it was on every single chill out compilation in the '90s), the album as a whole really sounded good with its mix of ambient and pop music. I really like the Middle Eastern elements in the music especially on "Lamentation". I find the music quite soothing and easy to meditate to. While Poem is my all time favorite Delerium album, Karma remains to be one of my biggest musical influences. I would not have gotten into Delerium if it wasn't for Karma (and my former roommate).

Blutengel is easily one of my top five favorite bands of all time. Their music is a melodic blend of vampire mythology, goth, and industrial music. Chris Pohl easily has one of the sexiest voices in music with his deep haunting vocals. He is backed by a couple of female singers. Unfortunately Blutengel's music is only available as import in the US which equals to spending a ridiculous amount of money. I recently received a copy of "Seelenschmerz" from a friend. I was so not disappointed in what I heard on this album. The music is undeniably catchy. All of the songs are filled with addictively catchy pop hooks making the songs difficult to not dance too. If you have heard Blutengel's other albums, "Seelenschmerz" sounds the same. The band doesn't tread on any new territory that hasn't already been heard. I really wasn't too crazy about the tracks with the rough, distorted vocals. The cd could have used some editing. I think it went on a little longer than necessary. Overall if you love Blutengel, this is an album worth checking out. I personally like it over "Demon Kiss" which had quite a few filler tracks. The number of filler tracks on this album wasn't a lot. Another flaw is the cost of the album. It isn't cheap. I wish Blutengel's music was more readily available in the US.

I really don't listen to a lot of my favorite bands from the '80s so much nowadays but one of the few bands from my adolescent that I still listen to is The Pretenders. Their music is a melodic mix of pop and punk. Chrissie Hyndes still sounds as good now as she did when I first heard her as a child. I personally think the band's GREATEST HITS cd is very good even if they didn't include one of my favorite songs "Revolution". I definitely think that GREATEST HITS is vastly superior over the band's singles compilation due to production and that the collection includes some of their more recent material from the '90s. My personal favorite Pretenders song will always be the beautiful ballad "Hymn to Her". That song always moves me. Love the pop hooks. I initially never cared much for "Brass in Pocket" (which I have heard that it is Chrissie Hynde's least favorite song) but as I get older, the song has really grown on me. I love the opening line and the beat. The only two songs I don't particularly care for on the compilation is the duets with UB40. I never liked UB40 to begin with. The songs were rubbish to me. Overall great compilation by one of my favorite bands of my childhood.

I have to admit I am not really a huge fan of the indie film GYPSY 83. The story of two disaffected youths leaving the safe haven of their home in Sandusky, OH to go to NYC for some tribute to Stevie Nicks did not do much for me. What did do for me was the film's awesome collection of modern goth and industrial music. Most soundtracks nowadays consists of pop or rap music. Not GYPSY 83. As much as I like Stevie Nick's original version of "Talk to Me", Diva Destruction's version totally blows her version out of the water. Sorry Stevie. I can totally listen to "Talk to Me" over and over again. I still do after all these years. My other favorite song is Velvet Acid Christ's "Dilaud (Postponed)". I love how Bryan Erickson's vocals are processed. I also like the child-like vocals during the chorus. I also enjoyed the two tracks by Karen Black (from The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black). It was rather different for me to hear her sing in a different style than I know her from. Her songs had a slick, seductive jazz feel. Good tracks. Ya can't go wrong with songs by Claire Voyant, Bauhaus, Apoptygma Berzerk and The Cure either. The soundtrack closes off with the haunting vocals of actress Sara Rue which was fairly interesting to hear. I wish more soundtracks nowadays would cater to my gothic and industrial tastes like GYPSY 83 did. This cd is definitely worth adding to one's collection if you like the aforementioned bands.

I had the most fortunate experience of being able to view "Jesus Camp" when it was in the movie theatres. "Jesus Camp" is the documentary that focuses on a pastor named Becky Fischer. She runs a summer camp called Kids on Fire in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. Her goal is to get her young audience to help shape the political culture by dragging religion into the political arena, destroying the whole concept of the separation of church and state. Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady follows Becky and a few of her youthful members around Devil's Lake and outside of the camp but they never appear on camera. There are no snarky editorials like there are in Michael Moore's films. Heidi and Rachel lets Becky and the kids do all the talking, making for a riveting film.From an atheist's point of view, I found this film absolutely terrifying because people like Becky Fischer are trying to shove religion down the throats of non-Christians and non-believers alike. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate Christianity itself per say. I was raised a Christian. It is some of its followers like Becky Fischer that terrifies me because they want to turn this country into a theocratic society. I do think everyone should have the freedom of religion, I just don't think this country needs to be known as solely as a Christian state given that not everyone is a Christian (like myself). Personally I think what the adults in Becky's church were doing to the children were brainwashing. They were hammering away what they (the adults) think is right and wrong. The children are not allowed to think for themselves or to question authority figures like Becky Fischer, at least from my point of view as someone who is not of any faith.The children in this film were riveting to watch to say the very least. I can easily see Levi becoming the next Pat Robertson of his generation. He has all the charisma to become a televangelist. Rachael is a young girl who dreams of becoming a manicurist so while she is doing people's nails, she can convert them to Christianity. She even tries to 'save' a friend of her's in the film who was obviously just playing along with her for Rachael's sake. Tory is the other kid that the filmmakers follow through out the film. She loves to dance and will only listen to music with Christian lyrics. Then there is the cameo appearance by the now defrocked Ted Haggard who obviously lives by the adage "do as I say not as I do".The more conservative evangelical Christians like Becky may think otherwise about this film judging by the way the film was edited but I wouldn't know from experience. I personally thought the film is pretty unbias towards Becky and her church. On the other hand, there might be some Christians who might think otherwise because of the way the film is edited. but keep in mind that Becky Fischer herself approved this film. For non-Christians/non-believers like myself "Jesus Camp" is an example of some of the ugliness that is being said in the Lord's name. All the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween movies combined don't have all the scare factor "Jesus Camp" possesses. The reason I found this film so terrifying is because it is actually real.

This film is pretty unbias towards Becky and her church. For non-Christians/non-believers like myself "Jesus Camp" is an example of some of the ugliness that is being said in the Lord's name. This is a film worth seeing for Christians and non-Christians.

For sometime now I have been meaning to check out Seabound but never got around to picking up any of their albums, until now. I recently got a copy of BEYOND FLATLINE. Initially I wasn't all that impressed with BEYOND FLATLINE. It sounded like your typical EBM act from Metropolis Records but the more I have listened to the cd, the more the music has grown on me. Yeah the music is a bit more mellow than it should be. The slower songs have that familiar synthpop-ish sound that reminded me of DE/Vision, Covenant, and Depeche Mode. I am not really particularly keen on the song "Digital". I didn't like the fact that the song was devoid of melody, nor did I care much for the distorted vocals. The band's strengths really lies in the more uptempo tracks like "Transformer" and "Watching Over You". Those songs have a lot of energy and makes me want to get up and dance. BEYOND FLATLINE is a nice introduction to Seabound. It isn't a perfect album but I like it enough to want to hear their other cds.

Long before the "Garden State" soundtrack, I first discovered Frou Frou on a dance compilation. There was a dance remix of "Breathe In" on the cd and the song really stood out with me. I eventually bought "Details". I liked the album but not as much as a lot of reviewers on amazon.com did...until now. I found a copy of "Details" at my local library and decided to give the album another chance. Much to my surprise, I found "Details" to be much more enjoyable this time around. Imogen Heap has one of the most distinct vocals around in pop music today. Her vocals has a smokey quality to it. The laid back electronic beats complements her vocals. Nothing new is offered here that I haven't heard before from the likes of Dido and Jem but that's alright. "Details" is chockful of addictive pop hooks and slick trip hop beats. There isn't one song on this album that I didn't like.

I am not a diehard fan of Dead Can Dance. I like what I have heard from TOWARD THE WITHIN. I always wanted to hear more of their music but money is tight for me. I opted for MEMENTO, a best of compilation. Their last compilation which was two discs but was a bit too pricey for me. MEMENTO was perfect as far as my budget is concerned. Dead Can Dance's music is a a beautiful, haunting mix of Middle Eastern, ambient, and a hint of folk music. Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard does a nice job of sharing vocal duties with each other. MEMENTO is the perfect cd to relax to with a steaming cup of tea after a hard day at the office. I find the music so calming to my nerves.

I have to confess that I am not really a diehard Covenant fan. I have owned a couple of cds of theirs in the past but never really got into them as I have with other EBM/synthpop bands. I decided to re-discover them since I have been on a huge synthpop kick in recent months. I recently acquired a copy of the group's 2006 cd SKYSHAPER. I admit that I wasn't really all that impressed with the album from the initial listen but now that I have listened to the album several times since getting it the other day in the mail, the music has really grown on me considerably. I wasn't all that crazy about the opening track "Ritual Noise". The constant droning, both musically and lyrically, was quite annoying. The same can be said about "Sweet & Salty". "Pulse" didn't really do much for me. It was pretty bland. I did love the electro-poppish sounds of "Happy Men" which reminded me quite a bit of early Depeche Mode. My other favorite songs includes "Brave New World" and "The World is Growing Loud". Both songs are beautiful ballads. SKYSHAPER may not be completely flawless but I still enjoyed what I heard. The album definitely revived my interest in the band.

I always been wanting to check out Suicide Commando for some time now. I recently acquired "Bind, Torture, Kill" a couple of weeks ago. I was definitely not disappointed. It took me a few listens for the music to sink but overall I thoroughly enjoyed what I heard. The music kinda reminded me of Mexico's Amduscia and Filament 38 with its distorted vocals and trance like melodies. The music is not your typical EBM. The music is fairly aggressive in comparison to other EBM bands like VNV Nation and Apoptygma Berzerk."Bind, Torture, Kill" opens up the album and quickly set the tone for the rest of the album with its aggressive but melodic synthesized melodies.The song could have easily been edited. The lyrics were minimal at best and hearing "Bind, Torture, Kill" over and over again quickly became tiresome. I like how the cd maintains its momentum and energy throughout the album. This terror EBM sound is a nice change of pace from the polished poppier sounds of Apop and VNV.

I was visiting my folks last weekend when I heard Alison Krauss's A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE cd on their stereo. I was surprised by just how good the cd was, so I bought myself my own copy after my visit. A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE is a collection of Alison Krauss's work as a solo artist. I have heard a bit of her work with Union Station but after hearing this collection, I think I like her work as a solo artist more so. I am not crazy about country or bluegrass music but Alison makes country and bluegrass quite palatable to me.One of the songs that stood out with me is Alison's beautiful interpretation of the classic "Baby Mine" from the film DUMBO. Her fragile vocals turned this already moving song into a more emotionally charged song for me. My other favorite song is her duet with Brad Paisley on "Whiskey Lullaby". I love the melodies and the depressing lyrics. "Simple Love" is another wonderful ballad. I even enjoyed Alison's duet with John Waite on the cheesy '80s song "Missing You". Every song on this collection is enjoyable to listen to. I couldn't find one song I didn't like.

Being a big fan of Icon of Coil, I try to make an effort to check out Andy LePlegua's side projects. I have to admit I am not big on Panzer Ag. The music didn't really stood out with me but it did not stop me from checking out Combichrist. I recently bought the latest Combichrist cd "Everybody Hates You". I have to say that I enjoyed this much more than Panzer Ag's first cd. The cd starts off with the thunderous "This s*it Will Fcuk You Up". The fast paced beats were in your face and aggressive. The momentum continues with "Enjoy the Abuse". Combichrist is definitely more aggressive musically than Icon of Coil but they still maintain that same melodic sensibility. You can certainly hear it in "Today I Woke to the Rain of Blood". The lyrics are a lot darker than IoC's and Andy's vocals not so polished. Andy takes on a more aggressive approach when he sings. The momentum in the songs never dies down. The energy rages on through out the cd. After listening to "Everybody Hates You", I am excited I will be seeing the band live this fall when they hit the road with KMFDM.

I have been a long time admirer of the Buddha Bar series for the last few years. Unfortunately I was mildly disappointed in the last two volumes. The last two volumes had taken a more Indian influence courtesy of DJ Ravin. I had preferred the work of Dave Visan (the son of Raymond Visan, founder of the club/bar Buddha Bar) and Claude Challe who mixed the first three Buddha Bar cds. I was a bit hesitant to buy volume eight because of my mild disappointment but when I found a used but in excellent condition copy, I decided to give the series another shot. I'm glad I did. Sam Popat, the dj at NYC's Buddha Bar, did not fail me. The music re-captures the magic that made me fall in love with the series. Sam Popat breathes in new life into the series with his mix of Asian and modern dance music. I absolutely loved both discs and usually I prefer the more laid back disc over the more dance orientated disc.

Of all the albums that The Bangles have put out in the 1980s, Everything is my personal favorite album. I always like the songwriting, pop hooks, and the harmonies between the four members. I recently acquired a cd copy of the album and have found myself falling in love with the music all over again. I find myself relating to the lyrics in the songs as much as a I did when I was a teenager, especially on tracks such as "Complicated Girl" and "Some Dreams Come True". My personal favorite tracks features now former bassist Michael Steele "Glitter Years", and "Complicated Girl". "Glitter Years" reads like a great story right out of the glam rock years in the '70s. I will say that I prefer the version of "I'll Set You Free" on the band's greatest hits album over the version on Everything. I also wasn't big on the melodies and lyrics on "Watching the Sky". Just not my favorite song but overall I still give Everything five stars. Just love this album and the band.

I'm relatively new to Azam Ali. I first discovered her through Vas's recent album. Awhile ago I came across her debut solo album "Portals of Grace" at my local library and I immediately picked it out. I immediately fell in love with "Portals of Grace". The comparisons to Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance is obvious. Azam has a powerful voice that is quite similiar to Lisa's especially when she is simply expressing herself via vocalizations. The mix of mediavel and Portugese music is quite lovely. One of my favorite tracks on the album is "Breton Medley" which reminds me quite a bit of Loreena McKennitt minus Loreena McKennitt, with its Celtic melodies. I get the goosebumps when I listen to "O Felix". Azam really gets to showcase her voice on this particular track. Her voice takes front and center while the instruments remain in the background. The only minor flaw I could find with Azam Ali's music is the eerily similiarities to Lisa Gerrard. Azam might want to try to create a more distinct sound of her own but overall I love her music. I'll take Azam Ali than any of pop artist out there today.

I am new to Pink Martini's music. I came across their latest cd HEY EUGENE! last weekend and decided to check it out. I didn't know what to really exepct but I loved what I had heard. I am normally not into lounge or jazz music. Most of it I find to be rather boring but Pink Martini livens things up a bit with their fusion of jazz and world music. Whenever I listen to HEY EUGENE!, I feel like I am in a smokey jazz club in the 1950s, drinking an extra dry martini while soaking in the music. I enjoyed listening to every single song on the album. HEY EUGENE! is a great cd to relax to with a cosmopolitan after a long day at work.

I recently caught Ayria perform live in Minneapolis this past week. I finally got a copy of her debut album Debris which I have been dying to own. I have not been able to stop listening to Debris. While there are no songs as addictive as "My Revenge On the World" or "Bad List" from Ayria's albums, the songs on Debris still is loaded with catchy pop hooks and pulsating dance beats. The version I bought included a second disc of remixes which I enjoyed listening to a lot as well. I really recommend catching Ayria live. I have seen her perform in person three times and every time the performances were energetic and entertaining. Her songs sounds amazing live.

I have to admit I am a big fan of The Bangles. Matthew Sweet I was never really a fan of. I came across UNDER THE COVERS VOL. 1 by the pair at my local library earlier this week. I had heard about this cd when it first came out. I decided to check it out to hear Matthew and Susanna's versions of a various mix of popular retro pop songs. Matthew and Susanna are fictional couple named Sid and Susie. I guess the record label wasn't too big on the concept behind the cover album therefore put a kibosh on the famous pair going by their fictional names for this project.Surprisingly I liked this album, or most of it anyways. There were some songs that I wasn't familiar with but it didn't stop me from enjoying the catchy power pop from Matthew and Susanna. I didn't care much for the duo's cover of "Cinnamon Girl". Their vocals didn't match well with the distorted guitars, plus I never liked the song to begin with. I also didn't care much for their version of The Who's "The Kids are Alright". I don't care for the melodies. My personal favorite song is "Sunday Morning". This song perfectly suits Susanna's vocals.Despite the few songs I didn't care for, I thought Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs put together a well crafted power pop album. Their vocals harmonized well together but I do prefer it when Susanna is harmonizing with her fellow Bangles. All in all this is a good, fun album.

I have been a fan of The Gits since I was a freshman in college (or maybe it was my senior year in high school). I first heard about them through the punk fanzine Flipside which led me to buy their album Frenching the Bully. Mia totally blew me away with her in your face vocals. When she was murdered in 1993, I was totally devastated as was the tight knit music scene in Seattle. Thanks to two diehard Gits fans, Mia's brief life can be seen in the wonderful documentary The Gits. The first half of the film focused on Mia's life as a loving tribute to a life that was cut short all too soon. It was evident that Mia was much loved by her family and friends. The second half of the film focused on Mia's murder. The filmmaker Kerri O'Kane did a great job of not sensationalizing her murder but instead had Mia's family and friends describe how the loss of Mia affected them. It was done very tastefully. There were quite a few moments when I had to reach for the kleenex box. I was particularly moved by what Mia's father had to say. His grief broke my heart. I was also touched by the scene when Joan Jett had to pause for a moment because she was getting choked up with emotion. For fans of The Gits, this film is a must see. It is a wonderful tribute to Mia.

Earlier this fall, I was shopping around at the mall for a new pair of headphones for my iPod. I came across the Sony MDR-G57G S2 and decided to give them a whirl. Now I wish I didn't. While the sound quality wasn't bad (I've heard better from other Sony ear/headphones that I have owned in the past), the comfort was a huge epic fail on Sony's part. I know the design was to make the headphones was to be more snug for active users with the extra ear pieces but apparently the people who designed that feature never had to wear them for more than five minutes. I have gone back to Phillips earphones that slides over my ears which I find a lot more freedom and comfort than this rancid headset from Sony. The sound quality is better to in my personal opinion.

I am not what you would consider a fan of country music but a few years ago I had discovered Kasey Chambers on a two song sampler cd. I automatically fell in love with her distinct (which are often nasally) vocals. Of all her cds, THE CAPTAIN is my personal favorite. I can listen to the cd without cringing like her most recent two albums to date. The one flaw with Kasey is her vocals. They sometimes become annoying but not enough to put me off of her music. I like how her music is anything but like passes off for country music nowadays. Her music is not polished like Carrie Underwood or Faith Hill. Her music is great road music to listen to especially songs like "The Captain" and "You Got the Car". Her lyrics often move me to tears like "The Captain". I find her lyrics very relatable. The only song I honestly do not care for is "Last Hard Bible". I just did not particularly like the melodies to the song, much less the lyrics. I liked how Kasey ended the cd with the goofy track "We're All Gonna Die Someday" which some of the melodies comes from the theme song to THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES tv show. All in all THE CAPTAIN is a solid country album.

I am new to Krishna Das. I first remember hearing a song by him on a chill out compilation a few years ago. What stood out for me was his deep, rich voice. I recently found a copy of his "Door of Faith" cd at my local library and thought it would be a good introduction to his music. For the most part I found "Door of Faith" to be very relaxing to listen to especially on a rainy Saturday morning with a steaming cup of coffee. My favorite track on the cd has to be "Sita's Prayer/Hey Mata Durga". Unfortunately this cd gets awfully monotonous because of Krishna's vocals within half way through the cd. It doesn't help that some of the songs are over several minutes long. The music is beautiful and I do like Krishna's deep, sensuous vocals but I think the cd would have been even better had the songs been edited.

A couple of weekends ago, I came across I WILL by Mozella at my library. On a whim, I checked it out. The first thing that came to my mind when I heard Mozella's voice is Macy Gray with a hint of Norah Jones. The only difference is that Mozella's voice doesn't irritate me like Macy Gray's does. Mozella's music is a subtle mix of pop, folk, blues, jazz, and a hint of jazz. I WILL is a solid album. It is filled with catchy pop hooks. The only issue I had with the album is Mozella's vocals. For the most part I don't mind her raspy vocals but her voice does occasionally rub me the wrong ways like on the ballad "I Will". Mozella's vocals definitely sounds better on the uptempo songs like "You Wanted It" and "Amnesia" (my personal favorite track). I'm not really big on the ballads except for "Can't Stop". It has a nice bluesy quality to the song. Plus Mozella's vocals really suits her well with the song's bluesy sound. I WILL may not be perfect but it sure is good. Mozella shows a lot of potential. I will be interested to see where her career will take off. I look forward to hearing more from this talented artist.

I'm not a big fan of Madonna's music as I once was but Ray of Light remains my favorite album she has put out. A lot of the credit goes to producer William Orbit who provides a killer sonic background to her lyrics. I think it is Madonna's most mature effort she has put out and it shows in her lyrics. I like how subtle the dance beats are and how they allow Madonna's vocals to be front and center. The ballads on this album are the best that Madonna has ever done especially "The Power of Goodbye", "Frozen", and "Skin". Ray of Light is not a perfect album.There were a few tracks that I didn't care for but most of the album I love.

"The Promise" is one of my top five favorite films from last year, and one of my all time favorite foreign films. What really made this film so enjoyable was the gorgeous orchestral film score provided by Klaus Badelt. I have to confess that I am not familiar with Klaus Badelt's work so I can't really compare this sumptuous film score with the rest of his work. Klaus did a great job of creating an epic film score it captured the essence of the film. His music matched perfectly with the scenes each song was assigned to. The melodies really resonated with me especially on the slower tracks. The percussion is a bit overwhelming at times but overall they did reflect what was going on in the film. I appreciated the fact that Klaus did not incorporate a pop vocal track of one of his songs like on the soundtracks for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "House of Flying Daggers". After hearing "The Promise", I am definitely curious to hear Klaus's body of work.

My musical tastes tends to the dark and aggressive side of music but sometimes I like to take the edge off with something relaxing. One of my cds I love to relax to is Josh Groban's self-titled debut album. I first discovered Josh on an episode of that dreadful "Ally McBeal" show several years ago. He sang one of the most beautiful ballads I have ever heard "To Where You Are". The song simply moved me to tears literally. I eventually bought the cd and the rest of the cd was as good as I expected. The cd is a beautiful collection of operatic style pop songs that will appeal to anyone who may not like opera music. At the time I hated opera but when I heard Josh Groban for the very first time, I started to appreciate the genre. I still don't care for some opera but for the most part I have come to tolerate and actually enjoy a good deal of the genre. My other favorite song on the album is "You're Still You" which I find to be as moving as "To Where You Are". Josh does a great job with my favorite Bach song "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". The only weak track on the cd for me is his duet with The Corrs "Canto Alla Vita". I just couldn't get into it but otherwise great album. It is my favorite Josh Groban cd of all time.

I have to admit, I never saw "The Passion of the Christ" nor do I have any desire to for other than I know the story so why would I want to see a glorified violent version of it on the big screen? The only reason I own a copy of the film score to the film is simply because I love the music. When I saw the trailers for the film a couple of years ago, the music really stood out especially during the crucifixion scene. John Debney's film score reminds me of Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's work for the "Gladiator" film and a bit of Dead Can Dance with the Middle Eastern influences in the music. The orchestral film score is truly of epic proportions. John Debney certainly knows that music does play an important key role in movies. Despite not having seen the film, the titles of the tracks do match the songs themselves. I can almost envision the emotions of the characters in the particular scene that the song accompanies. Regardless of my personal feelings of the actual film, I absolutely love the music to "The Passion of the Christ".

I love gothic metal. It is the only type of metal music I will listen to. Unfortunately a lot of gothic metal music nowadays is rather generic sounding and sounds awfully like Leaves' Eyes or Nightwish. This is not the case with Sirenia. A friend recently gave me a copy of "Nine Destinies and a Downfall". This is my first Sirenia cd so I can't compare this album with past Sirenia albums. As a new listener to Sirenia's music, I immediately fell in love with this album. The album is chockful of radio friendly gothic metal tracks. The songs are extremely accessible. I immediately fell in love with the album the moment I heard "Last Call". I knew I was in for a treat. I especially love "My Mind's Eye". I find myself playing this song over and over again because of the infectious pop hooks that permeates through the entire song. One of the things that stood out for me about this album is Monika Pedersen's clean vocals. Her vocals has a hint of Liv Kristine influence but they are very subtle. The musicianship is tight and solid. There was not one single song on this album I did not like. As a new fan I am curious to check out the band's earlier albums. I am well aware that their other albums with their former vocalist is not as clean and polished as "Nine Destinies and a Downfall". I understand why some longtime fans are not happy with this album. I could say the same about some of my favorite bands.

I am not really familiar with Kim Richey's music all save for a couple of songs. The few songs I have heard by Kim I really enjoyed so when I saw a copy of Kim's latest cd CHINESE BOXES this weekend, I thought I would check it out. Although albeit too short for my liking, I was not disappointed in what I heard. I am not normally a fan of country and folk music but there are a few exceptions. I found CHINESE BOXES very comforting to listen to. It is like putting on my favorite pair of flannel pajama bottoms or socks. Kim's music emits that same kind of warmth and security I get from wearing my favorite socks or pjs. I loved every song on the cd. They all had great unforgettable pop hooks. Like I mentioned earlier, this cd was a bit too short for my liking but other than the length of the cd CHINESE BOXES is flawless in my book.

I first discovered Cylab in the review section of Outburn magazine a few years. There was a review of their first cd "Unparallel Universe". My curiousity was immediately piqued because the reviewer compared Cylab with one of my favorite modern goth bands Collide. I became a fan the moment I listend to "Unparallel Universe"."Satellites" is Cylab's newest cd, it picks up where its predecessor left off. For a lot of bands, the 2nd album is the kiss of death (aka sophomore slump). Not here. "Satellites" is more addicting than "Unparallel Universe", if that is possible. SeVerina X Sol's seductive vocals is intoxicating as ever. Her vocals reminds me a bit of kaRIN from the band Collide but for the most part, she has her own distinct voice. Percy Trayanov provides the sonic landscape with his abilities as a musician and producer/composer.The music on "Satellites" still has that trip hop element that can be heard on "Unparallel Universe" but it isn't nearly as prevalent. There is a more industrial edge to the songs that wasn't on the band's first album. While all the songs are marvelous, the one song that truly stands out is "Dented Halos". The song has such a distinct sound. The programming Percy provides is nothing like I have ever heard before. The crisp synthesized beats just pounds incessantly over and over again.As I have said before, all of the songs on "Satellites" are awesome. SeVerina just oozes sex when she sings. If you dig Collide and Lucia Cifarelli's solo album, Cylab is definitely worth checking out. They are one of the best up and coming bands I have heard in the past five years.Track list:01.

After several years, my most recent boombox from Sony finally decided to test my patient by recognizing some of my CDS when I hit the play button. I eventually had enough of not being able to listen to some of my favorite CDS and decided to junk the POS for a new boombox. I decided on the Sony CFD S350 on a whim. It was reasonably priced and the size was something I was leaning towards since I live in a small one bedroom apartment. I will admit the mega bass on the boombox isn't so hot. I have had better quality in bass in my previous Sony boomboxes however I can live with what I got. The cassette player is useless to me since cassettes have gone the way of the dinosaurs. I do like the remote control. I think it is quite handy for this music fan who is a bit lazy ;). While the boombox is far from perfect, I am quite happy with it personally. I am just happy that I can listen to all of my CDS without any problems.

I'm normally not a big fan of Christmas albums. Most Christmas albums to me sound redundant. Not too long ago I had discovered that Celtic WOman had put out a Christmas album. Being a big fan of Celtic Woman, I made plans to buy the cd. When I heard samples of the cd today, I knew I had to buy it right away. "A Christmas Celebration" is a beautiful collection of traditional Christmas caroles with a couple of orginal tunes from producer David Downes. All of the songs, traditional and new, are beautiful. Almost two years since their first album came out, the women still sounds amazing. Orla and Chloe's vocals has certainly gotten stronger since the first album. I especially loved "O Holy Night" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas". It would be hard pressed to find anyone who didn't enjoy this collection other than snobby music critics who have accused CW of making schmaltzy music. The cashier at the store where I bought the cd even said that he enjoys the music. "A Christmas Celebration" is a must have for Celtic Woman fans as well as for Christmas music lovers.

I recently discovered the Appleseed movies a month ago. I had seen the film VEXILLE which was made by the same person who did the 2nd and 3rd Appleseed films. After I was blown away by the mix of hand drawn animation and CGI, I knew I had to check out his other film work. I was even more blown away by APPLESEED and APPLESEED EX MACHINA.It is 2131, there is one city left remaining on Earth called Olympus. Humans and bioroids (artificial clones) appears to co-exist peacefully. All is not well underneath the idyllic surface. The existence of bioroids have angered some humans thus leading to the destruction of a government building that contained third generation bioroids. The destruction of the building also means doom for bioroids who needs a life extension like Deunan's friend Hitomi.Deunan Knute, a tough as nails female soldier and her ex-boyfriend Briareos, who is 75% machine and the other members of the ESWAT team needs to retrieve the lost Appleseed technology to help Hitomi and the rest of Olympus, and put a kibosh on the growing threat of the military.I personally loved this film. The action was non-stop. The animation was awesome. I love the combination of hand drawn animation and CGI. The techno soundtrack fits perfectly into the setting of the film. I personally enjoyed the storyline.

A couple of months ago I rented the documentary The Gits. The film quickly re-awoke a love I had for the band when I was in high school and college. Since I had sold my copy of Frenching the Chicken years ago, I found a copy of the re-release version that was re-titled Frenching the Bully. I admit that I thought the live tracks were pretty useless to me but the first half of the album makes it all the well worth the money spent on it. Mia Zapata had and always will have an amazing vocals especially in the punk genre (IMO The Gits' music was NOT grunge).After well over a decade, I was surprised by how well The Gits' music has held up despite the amount of time that I had spent not listening to them. I never heard a woman like Mia sing like the way she did in the alternative/punk rock scene. She had a big, powerful voice which really convey the emotions she invested into her lyrics. After all these years, "It All Dies Anyways" remains my favorite Gits song. It is so darn catchy. I also love "Another Shot of Whiskey" and "Second Skin". The death of Mia was a tragedy to say the very least. The Gits never got to show how truly special they were really were and what they had to offer. I definitely recommend "Frenching the Bully" for those who saw The Gits documentary and loved it as well as any music fan looking for something new and different.

Of all the types of sub-genres in the realm of heavy metal music, gothic metal is my personal favorite. Last year I discovered the Los Angeles metal band Echoes of Eternity via the internet. Judging by the samples I heard, my curiosity was piqued. The US isn't exactly the first place I would think of for gothic metal. Most of the gothic metal bands, if not all, I listen to are from Europe like Elis and Leaves' Eyes. You would never know that Echoes of Eternity was from LA if you closed your eyes and listened to their music."Forgotten Goddess" is the band's new album on Nuclear Blast records. It is a forty-something minuts of epic gothic metal. Initially the cd didn't strike me as anything out of the ordinary. The songs sounded too much alike which is the band's biggest flaw through out the album. What did stand out to me is the obvious Liv Kristine resemblance in lead singer Francine Boucher's vocals. Both women share the same delicate vocals. After listening to "Forgotten Goddess" several times, the music eventually started to sink into my sub consciousness. Musically there is nothing new or fresh about "Forgotten Goddess". This is standard gothic metal however the songs are better than average. They are certainly better than any of the songs on the dreadful Evanescence album "The Open Door". My personal favorite song on the album has to be "Circles to Stone". I just love the melodies and Francine's vocals on this particular song.Echoes of Eternity showed a lot of promise on "Forgotten Goddess". Hopefully the band will start to develop its own sound and create songs that do not sound the same. I really do like the band a lot. It is hard to believe they are not from Europe like their peers in the gothic metal genre. Their music shares the same qualities that their European peers create in the music. I look forward to hearing more from Echoes of Eternity in the future.

Bananarama is one of my favorite pop groups from the '80s. Their music was a ton of fun to listen to and it still is for me to this very day. I recently got hold of a copy of THE VERY BEST OF BANANARAMA. I never thought about it until recently that the group was a precursor to The Spice Girls but a lot more fun and a lot less stupid. THE VERY BEST OF BANANARAMA is a comprehensive look at the group's past and present hits, with and without Siobhan Fahey. Yeah a lot of the group's songs are corny like "Robert DeNiro's Waiting" and "Nathan Jones" but Bananarama's music has always been a lot of fun to listen for me. My personal favorite songs are when Siobhan was still in the group. I absolutely love "Cruel Summer", "Venus", and "I Heard a Rumor". I don't consider Bananarama a guilty pleasure. I am not ashamed that I was and still am a fan of the British pop group today.

I recently discovered that George V records had created another spin-off of the Buddha Bar series with Buddhattitude. Unlike the Buddha Bar compilations, Buddhattitude consists of one cd with original music, not a diverse mix of songs by various artists. The cd I just discovered is the Liberdade cd. As a long time fan of the Buddha Bar series, I have to say that this new spin-off is rather disappointing. I rather found this cd a bit dull although it is relaxing to listen to after a hard day at the office. The music is a mix of new age, Latin, and a hint of Parisian. What I liked about the Buddha Bar cds was the Asian influences that permeated in the music. LIBERDADE didn't have a whole lot of spark and is rather dull. What a shame coming from my favorite chill out series.

I just received a copy of FIX-IT AND FORGET-IT COOKBOOK for Christmas. I have already made one recipe from the book and enjoyed it immensely. I tried the just peachy ribs over the weekend. The ribs were fall off the bone tender. I love the combination of fruit and pork. I definitely plan on using this book and my crock pot more often. I have already marked off several compelling recipes for future uses. What I like about the cookbook is how simple the recipes are. I think the intentions of the recipes were to make it easy for people with families to just throw the ingrediants into the crock pot, set it, and go to work while the food cooks. I get the impression that some reviewers wanted something more complicated and more pretentious haute cuisine recipes. The only flaw with the cookbook is that the similiarities in a lot of the recipes. I have noticed that some of the recipes like for pot roast looks vaguely similiar to one another. Overall so far I am enjoying finding recipes to make in my crock pot. I am looking forward to utilizing my slow cooker more often now and not just for pot roast.

I don't know who came up with this product but clearly the responsible party does not know anything about goldfish. This 2.5G starter kit is a death chamber for goldfish. Goldfish are not hardy like the wonderful betta splendens. Goldfish are high maintenance critters. First they eat a lot of vegetation and well...what goes in must come out. In other words, they have to relieve themselves quite a bit. For their bathroom habits, goldfish requires a powerful filter which this product was not designed to hold. Secondly, goldfish are social fish. They like to be among their own kind and 2.5 gallons is not big enough for a few goldfish, let alone one goldfish. If anything you can use this start kit for betta fish but you will need a heater for it. Bettas are tropical fish whose origins are based in Thailand. They are used to warm waters in the range of 75 to 80 degrees fahrenheit. You will also need a cover because bettas are jumpers. Oh and try to do water changes every 3 days. After all fishes live in their own toilets. The ammonia in their waste does affect their health. Products like this so-called Goldfish Bowl Start Kit is an abomination. The company who makes these awful products are profiting off bad information passed around at pet stores and online. Please do your research in fish forums before you invest in a fish regardless of species. If you don't, the consequences could be fatal for the fish.

I first heard of Imogen Heap when she was working with Guy Sigsworth in the short lived Frou Frou. I had heard their catchy song "Breathe In" on a dance compilation and loved what I heard. This was prior to the smash soundtrack for the film GARDEN STATE that really introduced Frou Frou to Americans. After the break up of FROU FROU, Imogen obviously soldiered on and put out another solo album (she had released another but hard to find years ago).SPEAK FOR YOURSELF is her latest solo album. For fans of Frou Frou, you will definitely not be disappointed. The music is a smmoth mix of trip hop, pop, and folk. All of the songs are written and produced by Imogen Heap herself. In this day and age of disposable pop stars from the Disney Channel, it is so refreshing to see an artist write and produce her own music. What makes Imogen so unique is her distinct vocals which are anything but overpolished.I enjoyed SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. The music is just as good as her work with Frou Frou although it took me a couple of listens for the music to sink in. I wish though she would have branched out a bit more and explored other sounds. Repetition was my major flaw with this album. A lot of the songs sounded the same. I can definitely forgive Imogen for repetition though. Her cd is wonderful.

I have always wanted an ipod. I just either didn't have the money or know which model to get. I was thrilled when I finally got an ipod, specifically the ipod shuffle, as a gift for Christmas. I had the option to trade the ipod shuffle in for a nano but I decided on the shuffle. 240-250 songs was plenty for me. Secondly I liked the compact features especially when it comes to listening to music at work. For me personally having over 200 songs on my iPod is more than enough. Secondly when I am at work, I don't really have the time to mess with the thing depending on my musical mood.The two somewhat minor gripes I had about the iPod shuffle was downloading iTunes on to the computer and the ear buds. If you have dial up and on AOL, you want to DL'd itunes via Internet Explorer or some sort of separate browser (especially if your OS is Windows). Don't do it through AOL. You will get a Win32 error message. There is a technical support message board on Apple's website that you can refer to if all else fails but downloading iTunes via IE or another browser (that isn't AOL) should do the trick.The other gripe is the earbuds. They can become very uncomfortable after awhile. I don't know why Apple can't improve on the earbuds. If they can improve the ipod, then they can improve the earbuds. I have to switch to my earphones that I used on my computer at work when I listened to cds. Would it be asking too much for Apple to create a more comfortable pair of ear buds for the iPod?Overall I love my ipod shuffle. I was quite pleased that the ipod attaches to my clothing nice and snug. It does not fall off very easily. I don't have to worry about having to lock up my ipod when I walk away from my desk for awhile. I can simply throw it into my pocket. I am very happy with my ipod.

Never really was a huge fan of Zero 7 especially when they first came out with the song "Destiny". I did though like their second cd "When It Falls". A few years ago I was in to chill out music but now I am not so much in to the genre anymore. When I saw "The Garden" at my local library I thought I would check it out. "The Garden" shares the same warm vibe that "When it Falls" possesses. The music is nice to listen to on a weekend morning with a cup of coffee and the morning paper. Unfortunately I just couldn't really get into the cd. I especially wasn't big on the more groove laden tracks like "This Fine Social Scene" and "Crosses". Not a huge fan of the cowbell and it really got on my nerves in the song "Crosses". It makes me think of the old Blue Oyster Cult song "Don't Fear the Reaper". The instrumental tracks were far more interesting because they weren't bogged down by such boring vocals from everyone who contributed to the album. I wish I was able to get into this album like I did with the last Zero 7 cd but I just can't. Too boring and lifeless which is what chill out music has become.

Erasure is one of my all time favorite pop groups from the 1980s. Their music always cheers me up whenever I am feeling down. The group's first compilation Pop! was the cd that really introduced me to the group. Unfortunately the production is pretty shoddy. Four years ago Mute released another Erasure compilation with better production value. Unfortunately Mute Records left off a considerable amount of Erasure material for a best of compilation. There is no songs off Erasure's self-titled album or "Cowboy", two of my personal favorite Erasure albums. It seems that this compilation as nothing more than to make money off the group. If they relaly cared about the fans, the label would have covered all of the group's past recordings and include some bonus tracks or a dvd. Still I am glad to hear "A Little Respect" and "Oh L'Amour" with better production quality because the orginal versions sounds like crud. If you want to hear your favorite Erasure songs with better production quality, I recommend buying this cd. If you are a serious diehard Erasure fan, don't buy it. It's obvious cash cow for Mute Records.

BLACK CHERRY is one of those rare albums where I initially didn't care for it but later on in life loves it. I first discovered Golfrapp through television. FELT MOUNTAIN is one of my personal favorite trip hop albums of all time. I loved the lush, orchestral melodies of the album. So when the time came for Goldfrapp to release their follow up album BLACK CHERRY, I wasn't too keen on the group's sudden change in their sound from trip hop to electro-clash.After falling in love with the group's music again with SEVENTH TREE, I decided to check out BLACK CHERRY again. This time time around I have learned to appreciate and love BLACK CHERRY. BC is definitely a precursor to their next album SUPERNATURE with their mix of catchy electro-pop songs as well as SEVENTH TREE with the more laid back trip hop songs. I am particularly fond of the more upbeat tracks like "Train" and "Twist". I love the slinky synth beats. As much as I like the slower paced songs on the album like the title track, the more uptempo tracks are my personal favorite. Overall I am glad that I re-discovered BLACK CHERRY. If you loved SUPERNATURE, you will definitely like BLACK CHERRY.

Social Distortion is one of the few bands I still listen to from my dreadful high school years. I first discovered Social D via MTV (believe it or not) when MTV played actual music videos that were good and didn't cater to the tween market. I recently found out that Mike Ness released a Social D greatest hits compilation. When I got hold of a copy of the cd, I was quite surprised by how short the greatest hits package is given the band's history. What is more surprising that the package didn't include their material when they were on Sony Records.Regardless of the length of the cd and what it is lacking, the songs on this cd are all classic Social Distortion tracks like "Prison Bound" and "Ball and Chain". What drew me to Social Distortion from the beginning was the infectious melodies. The song that introduced me to Social Distortion was "Ball and Chain". I could not get that song out of my head for days on end until I bought the cassette version of their 1990 self-titled album. The band's cover of the Johnny Cash classic "Ring of Fire" is as good as the original. I rarely say that about most cover songs. I liked all ten songs on this greatest hits package. I just wish that it was a more comprehensive compilation than a ten song sampler which this cd looks and sounds like than a greatest hits package.

Hanzel und Gretyl is easily my favorite industrial/metal band. It has been two years since they unleashed "Scheissmessiah" upon the public. "Oktotenfest 2006" isn't a full length HuG cd but rather a tasty sample of what to expect next year when the band puts out a new album. Unfortunately the four track EP is only twelve minutes long. Too short for my personal taste but it sure beats waiting until 2007 to hear new HuG. Track #1 and #4 are more samples than songs themselves. Tracks #2 and #3 are absolutely mindblowing. "Stern Krieg" and "Fukken Uber Death Party" are the heaviest songs that Loopy and Vas Kallas has ever put out. The songs are simply brutally aggressive industrial/metal, almost death metal like especially on "Fukken Uber Death". The two songs are aggressive and melodic similiar to "SS Deathstar Supergalatick" and "Disko Fire Scheissmessiah". Awesome songs to listen to at top volume. I wish "Oktotenfest 2006" was a full length album but beggers can't be choosers. This is an excellent appetizer to whet my Hanzel und Gretyl fix.

"EVOLution" is my first Decoded Feeback cd. I recently discovered them on MySpace and I liked the songs they had on their media player from "EVOLution". I was automatically reminded of other great electro/industrial bands like Velvet Acid Christ and Suicide Commando, especially with Marco Biagiotti's distorted vocals. It took me several listens for "EVOLution" to grow on me. This was probably not the best Decoded Feedback cd to begin with for new listeners like myself but I had to hear the group's cover of the Frozen Autumn song "Bio-Vital" which is simply awesome. Another great song is "Infect Me". Marco's vocals is a bit more cleaner and there is a more atmospheric element in the music similiar to Sisters of Mercy and Clan of Xymox. The first six tracks on the cd are original songs and the final six are remixed versions. To be honest, I prefer the original versions. I was rather bored with the remixes. I definitely prfer the original cover of "Bio-Vital" over the Fictional remix. "EVOLution" is good but not an ideal choice for a new DE fan like myself but it certainly cemented my admiration for the group and their music.

I first discovered Sleepthief on the internet not too long ago. After hearing a few samples of his song, I immediately found myself seduced by the ethereal female vocals and lush electronic beats. I finally got my hands on a copy of Sleepthief's debut album "The Dawnseeker". I found the music to be intoxicating.The music reminded me of Delerium, Conjure One, and Balligomingo with its gentle electronic beats and exquisite female vocals. Any wonders why the music is so vaguely familiar, Kristy Thirsk, Harland, and Kirsty Hawkshaw have all sung on albums by Delerium, Conjure One, and Balligomingo. I knew I was going to love "The Dawnseeker" the moment I heard the opening track "Eurydice" w/Jody Quine. A lot of the credit for musical arrangements is Israel Curtis. All the women who have sung on the album have lovely voices. Their voices matches well with the music. As far as favorite songs goes, it is hard to pick a favorite. I must say though that "Eurydice" and "You Did a Good Thing" really stood out for me. "The Dawnseeker" did not disappoint me one bit. I am looking forward to what Justin Elswick has to offer down the road.

It is hard to believe that BRICKS ARE HEAVY by the band L7 is fifteen years old. The cd was released in 1992. I was a junior in high school and when I first heard the album, the music was a breathe of fresh air to me. While my peers in high school were listening to hip hop and r&b; (which I found to be absolute rubbish and still do to this very day), I had embraced the alternative culture that Nirvana had pushed to the forefront of mainstream music. L7 was my Nirvana especially BRICKS ARE HEAVY.BRICKS ARE HEAVY is 37 minutes of pure ecstasy for me. The music is both grunge and punk. As aggressive as the music is, every song is riddled with great pop hooks. Songs like "Everyglade" and "Mr.Integrity" are great examples of the band's talent of mixing aggressive music with infectious pop hooks without sounding like the Go Go's (not that there is anything wrong with the Go Go's). My personal anthem for me was "Pretend We're Dead". That song embodied the angst and nihilism of my high school years.As an adult in her early 30s, BRICKS ARE HEAVY remains as relevant to me as it did fifteen years ago. I still revere this modern rock classic as highly as I did as a teenager. Although I enjoyed the band's follow up albums, none of them really captured the essence of fun and energy of BRICKS ARE HEAVY.

Mark Isham is quickly becoming one of my favorite composers. His work on the indie film "The Cooler" introduced me to his talents and I enjoyed what I heard. It wasn't until "Crash" did I really start taking notice of his work. Mark's work on "Crash" is a mix of ambient and classical with a glimmer of Middle Eastern (like on the song "Flames"). A lot of film composers have a terrible habit of creating loud, bombastic music that simply overwhelms the film and the person watching the film. Mark avoids the bombastic trappings of Hans Zimmer and John Williams by creating a more lush, haunting, minimal score that will leave a profound, moving effect on the filmgoer. One of the best songs on the album is "Flames" a gorgeous Middle Eastern-influenced track with ethereal female vocals that reminded me of Azam Ali and Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance. My other favorite song on the cd is "In the Deep" by Bird York. The song is a lovely folk/pop/jazz song that captures the emotional turmoil that occurs through out the film. I wasn't too wild about The Stereophonics track. It kinda killed the intimate sound Mark Isham created. At least Bird York's song had that same lush, intimate, atmospheric sound. While "Crash" wasn't perfect by all means, the music itself is perfect in every sense of the word at least to me it is. Too bad I can't say the same for his recent work for "The Black Dahlia".

I used to be a big fan of trance music a few years ago but as time went on, the genre became stale and dull. Every trance artist used that same tiresome recipe of a male programmer/dj and a female singer. I can't tell one Euro pop act from another nowadays. They all sound alike. No wonder their careers don't last for more than two albums. Cascada follows that same cookie cutter, formulaic recipe that made their peers like 4 Strings and their tiresome ilk popular.I have to admit Cascada's music is quite melodic. The pop hooks quickly got stuck in my head. It is hard not want to dance to this music. Unfortunately everything else sounds generic and lifeless. Cascada offers nothing new or original. Was it really necessary to cover that treacly Savage Garden ballad "Truly, Madly, Deeply"? I did though like their cover of Kim Wilde's "Kids in America" but how many times can that song be covered? Obviously not enough.Cascada quickly reminded me why I no longer listen to vocal trance music any more. It all sounds the same. This genre needs to die quickly.

ASIAN DREAMLAND is the first Putumayo Kids collection I actually like. I didn't particularly care for the FRENCH PLAYGROUND collection which is why I have been hesitant to check out the other cds in the Putumayo Kids series. As a fan of Asian music, I decided to check out ASIAN DREAMLAND on a whim. I should not that only 3 out of 10 artists on this cd is NOT Japanese which led me to wonder why the people at Putumayo didn't include more non-Japanese artists from Asia. Go figure. The music on a whole is quite lovely. I like to end my night listening to the album. I find the music very soothing for my stressed out soul. I remember hearing the song "Moon Boat" on a Puffy (Amiyumi) cd years ago. It was interesting to hear this version slowed down a bit. I really like Emme's "Dokokade Yoruga Naita" as well. I find Emme's delicate vocals quite pretty. "Kokoro Ni Dakarete" by the Yoshida Brothers is a pretty instrumental. As I mentioned before, I wished the folks diversified the album a bit more but overall ASIAN DREAMLAND is quite a lovely album to listen to for anyone young or old.

One of my favorite bands from the '80s was the Go Go's. Their music was fun and catchy. I liked some of Belinda Carlisle's solo work. I recently came across Belinda's latest album "Voila" which is a French album, how appropo since she lives in France. I was pleasantly surprised to hear how good the album is since a lot of crossover albums basically rots in my personal opinion. Belinda's Parisian album worked for the most part in terms of achieving that sensuous Parisian feel. There were a couple of tracks I was not too keen on like "Bonnie Et Clyde" and "Jezebel". I didn't care for "Bonnie Et Clyde" because I found the melodies so irritating and as much as this pains me to say this but Belinda's vocals grates on my nerves on this particular song. The bonus disc with the english versions of some of the songs were okay but I definitely prefer the Parisian versions. My favorite song on this album has to be "Sous Le Ciel De Paris". I found the melodies difficult to get out of my head. Although I do not understand a lick of French, I just loved hearing Belinda Carlisle sing the lyrics. I also loved the added touch of the accordion. Despite not liking a couple of songs on the album, "Voila" is still a lot of fun to listen to. In this day and age of disposable pop acts, it is always great to see someone I grew up on like Belinda Carlisle put out some new music.

I honestly can't say that I was a big fan of the '90s alt-rock band The Cranberries. They had a few songs I liked here and there but overall I wasn't what you could call a diehard fan of the band. In the past few weeks I have been hearing good things about the solo album by Dolores O'Riordan, the former lead singer of The Cranberries. I recently acquired a copy to see if it is any good. Much to my surprise, ARE YOU LISTENING? turned out to be better than expected. The more I listened to the cd, the more the music grew on me. The music is melodic pop/rock reminiscent of Dolores' former band with a sprinkling of celtic and electronica music. I really liked the first two tracks "Ordinary Day" and "When We Were Young". They have that similiar catchy pop/rock sound that you would usually hear in say Avril Lavigne's music. There were moments on the cd when I thought I was listening to Sinead O'Connor like on "In the Garden". Dolores' vocals reminded me of Sinead. Another favorite song of mine is "Human Spirit". I liked the celtic influences in the melodies and Dolores' vocals on this particular track. I wasn't too crazy about "In the Garden", "Stay With Me", or "Loser". I wasn't keen on the melodies on either song, and I certainly thought the lyrics for "Loser" was cliched. Overall I thought ARE YOU LISTENING? is a very strong effort from The Cranberries' former lead vocalist.

Tonight I was perusing youtube when I came across the music video for "Bury My Lovely" by October Project. I quickly fell in love with the song all over again. The first time I had heard it was on a local radio station in the '90s. At the time I had never heard anything like October Project. Mary Fahl had the most distinctive and unique vocals I had ever heard and still does to this very day. So on a whim I ended up downloading October Project's self-titled album. What a great album OCTOBER PROJECT is, this is my kind of pop music. All of the songs are enchanting with the lush melodies, gentle acoustic rhythms, and Mary's unique vocals. I am baffled how this album did not attract a larger audience. All of the songs had great pop hooks. I love all of the songs. There was not one track that I did not like on the album. Terminating the band's recording contract was a massive mistake on Epic/Sony's part. October Project truly deserved better treatment but at least their music will always live on forever.

Ever since getting a new computer last year which included a cd burner, I have been having a lot of fun burning music on to cds. In the past year, I have tried all brands of blank cds. Most of the brands I have tried are good, only one brand I didn't like. My favorite brand of blank cds I use are Memorex CD-Rs. I have always been happy with them because: a) they are reasonably priced and b) the sound quality is good. I have never had an issue with the Memorex brand name, unlike Sony. What I don't like is now they don't include the cover sheet for me to write down the songs I am going to burn on to the cd. Overall I am happy with the CD-Rs Memorex has churned out.

Last weekend I had just completed a water change for my two male Bettas when I noticed that the temperature was 72 degrees. For Bettas, they need to be in water that is at least 74 to 76 degrees. So I made a unexpected run to the nearest major pet retail store and bought the Mini Heater. The tanks I have is a 1 gallon Mini Bow junior Aquarium and a large Kritter Keeper. I found that the Mini Heater was ideal for the Kritter Keeper. The temperature of the water got to the ideal temperature for my Betta Osirius which was 78 degrees and remained at that temperature over night. The Mini Heater in my Mini Bow aquarium heated up too quickly and got as high as 82 degrees (this led me to order online a new larger home for my other Betta Anubis). I really like how silent the heater is. I think this heater is more appropriate for 2 gallon tanks than 5 gallon tanks judging by a few less than impressed reviewers. I am thinking that the more room and water in the tank, the less higher the temperatures will rise). For Betta owners who have smaller tanks and bowls than 5 gallons, I wholeheartedly would recommend this heater.

"The Black Dahlia" was a massive cinematic disappointment for me. The film was about anything but Elizabeth "the black dahlia" Short. I was also disappointed in Mark Isham's film score as well and I have enjoyed Mark's work in the past from "The Cooler" to "Crash". I didn't particularly care for "The Zoot Suit Riots" track because it was loud and bombastic but I guess it was created that way to coincide with the opening scenes when the riots were going on. I definitely liked it when Mark took it down a few notches on "The Two of Us" and for most of the cd. I wish that KD Lang's sultry interpretation of "Love for Sale" was included on the cd. My personal favorite tracks on the soundtrack has to be the lush, orchestral sounds of "Madeline" and the seductive ballad "Dwight and Kay". Unfortunately the songs tend to sound alike and listening to "The Black Dahlia" feels like one long extended track. I hope for his next project, Mark Isham won't create music as dreary and monotonous as what I heard on this soundtrack.

I am a new fan of The Pierces, a sister act. I have read a lot of good reviews about the group The Pierces which got my attention. I was curious to hear their music. I recently picked up their latest cd THIRTEEN TALES OF LOVE AND REVENGE. I am absolutely hooked. The music is catchy and a lot of fun to listen too. I guess I would describe their music as indie pop. The lyrics are as quirky and playful as their music is. The group uses a lot of interesting instruments on through out the album like the glockenspiel, Hawaiian lap steel, slide whistle, sitar, and autoharp which you wouldn't hear on your typical pop album. THIRTEEN TALES OF LOVE AND REVENGE is anything but your typical pop album. The lyrics are laced with bitterness and anger over relationships that went sour. The sisters' vocals reminds me a bit of Gwen Stefani (like on "Lights Up"), Alanis Morrisette, and Fiona Apple but for the most part they have their own style of singing. I usually am not fond of when music critics fawn over certain artists because they tend to not live up to their hype but this is not the case with The Pierces. The critics were spot on with this talented duo.

I loved the now defunct tv series "Angel". One of the reasons was because of the ties it had with the tv series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". One of my favorite things I loved about Angel was the gorgeous opening classical song by Darling Violetta. It wasn't until the cancellation that a proper soundtrack for the show was released last year. "Angel: Live Fast, Die Never" is a mix of dramatic instrumentals composed by Robert J. Kral and a few tracks with vocals. Robert Kral's compositions are excellent although a few tracks do drag the cd down time-wise. There is a good balance of drama, melancholy, and comedy in the orchestral compositions. As far as the tracks with vocals goes, Kim Richey's "A Place Called Home" easily is my personal favorite track. Her fragile vocals and brooding melodies makes the song all the more sorrowful, especially in the scene that it was placed in. I wasn't really big on the VAST track. I am simply not a big VAST fan to begin with. I did love the songs that Andy Hallet (as Lorne) and Christian Kane (as Lindsay) sang on, especially Andy's unique interpretation of "It's Not Easy Being Green". I have to admit this cd was a little long for my taste. It definitely could used some editing on the instrumentals but otherwise great soundtrack.

I love Sony electronics. My stereo and cd walkman are Sony products. They are durable and last a long time. Unfortunately I can't say the same about Sony's CD-Rs. I just bought this 20 pack of multicolor CD-Rs this weekend to burn some cds for a friend. I have already had to toss out five CD-Rs because they did NOT work. I had the same problem with another kind of Sony CD-Rs. I thought it was fluke but I guess not. Never will I ever buy any CD-R with the name Sony on it. I'll stick with my trusty ol' Maxwell. They have never failed me once. Even 3M makes better CD-Rs than Sony and that's just sad. Avoid Sony's CD-Rs if possible unless you have money to throw away.

I swear my movie going experience has become fewer and far between. There are not many movies that interests me. 2008 was a pretty rancid year for movies IMO. I could count on one hand the times I went to the theatre to see a movie. Of the five films I have seen, my favorite film of 2008 is the Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is based on the John Ajvide Lindqvist novel which was originally published as LET ME IN (before it was re-published as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN). John is also responsible for writing the screenplay for the film and I am glad he did. Anyone else would have destroyed the story (I can imagine that will happen with the American butchering of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN).The film adaptation centers around 12 year old Oskar (Kayre Hedebrant)who is friendless and is constantly bullied by three of his peers at school. His torment is so bad he takes out his frustrations on a tree at night with a knife he had appropriated. One night outside in the frigid cold, Oskar meets 12 year old girl Eli (Lina Leandersson) who had recently moved into his apartment building with an adult male companion named Hakan. Initially the two youngsters are wary of each other but eventually they become friends. What Oskar doesn't know at the time is that Eli doesn't look like what she appears to be and through out the film, the viewer is given subtle glimpses to who Eli really is as a person.I have read the book and Tomas Alfredson pretty much stays true to the story (with the help of the author himself). There are definite huge chunks of the book left out but probably because Lindqvist wanted the film to focus more on the relationship between Oskar and Eli. I truly loved the film and the storyline. I love how Tomas manages to balance the horrors of Eli's dark, vampire nature with her tender relationship with Oskar. The film is driven by a beautiful classical film score by John Soderqvisk which captures the lonelieness, joy, and terror that comes with the film. The child actors of Kayre and Lina were wonderful to watch. I really enjoyed Lina's performance as Eli which was often heartbreaking especially in the last fifteen-twenty minutes of the film.LET THE RIGHT ONE IN goes beyond just being a horror film. It is also a character study which the Swedes are quite famous for in their films. I saw this film twice in the theatre and that is rare for me. I am not the horror fan that I once was but I actually enjoyed all of the more violent scenes especially the one involving Virginia and a bunch of cats which made me laugh out loud. Some people might not like the pacing of the film but I found it to be just perfect. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is worth viewing and reading. For me this is the vampire film from 2008 that is worth viewing.

I am a new fan to 18 Summers. 18 Summers consists of two members Felix Flaucher and Frank Schwer. I recently discovered the band on myspace not too long ago. After hearing samples of their music, I was hooked. I loved the group's blend of goth, synthpop, and folk music. It is nothing like I am used to hearing. VIRGIN MARY is my first 18 Summers cd which I just got today. The music is amazing. One minute I could be listening to a beautiful folk song like "Virgin Mary", the next I will be listening to a catchy synthpop song like "Girl of 18 Summers". I love the fact that this duo doesn't adhere to one particular sound. While I love every song on the album, the songs that really stood out with me are the folk-based tracks like "Heavenly Creatures " and "Dr. Leyland". The lush acoustic melodies and haunting lyrics really captivated me. As I am listening to VIRGIN MARY again, I have yet to find a song that I do not like. The music is so nothing like a lot of the traditional synthpop music that I listen to on a regular basis. 18 Summers totally made a fan out of this new listener.

I am normally not a huge fan of distorted, gruff vocals in industrial music. I get pretty tired of it within a few songs. This is not the case with Funker Vogt. I actually enjoy lead singer Jens Kastel's distorted vocals coupled with the club-friendly, danceable music. AVIATOR is the band's latest effort. It is as melodic as their last studio album. The first cd consists of original tracks. My favorite songs has to be "Paralyzed", "Child Soldier", and "City of Darkness". The songs had a lot of energy, aggressive, and melodic. The only flaw with the band's sound is that the songs tends to sound alike. The second disc is a few bonus tracks as well as remixes. I didn't care much for the song "Deathmachine". I thought that was the worst Funker Vogt song I had ever heard. The remixes didn't really sound any different to me. Frankly they could have just skipped the second disc and I would have been perfectly happy with disc one. For the most part AVIATOR is a good industrial album but I think it is time for the band to up the ante and do something with their current sound which is a bit repetitious at times.

I'm relatively new to Dead Can Dance's music. I have heard only a couple of their albums. I can't really say I became a massive DCD fan but I certainly have enjoyed their music from what little I have heard. I recently found a copy of INTO THE LABYRINTH at my library and decided to check it out. I am very glad that I did get the cd. I felt like I was in another world whenever I listen to the cd. The Middle Eastern influences certainly gives the music an international flair. The production is immaculate. I can hear every single word that comes floating out of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry's voices. There is also a live vibe. I almost feel as if I am in the recording studio watching the duo sing. While I do enjoy Brendan Perry's vocals, I have to admit I like Lisa's vocals a bit more. Her vocalizations often reminds me of one of my all time favorite sings, Loreena McKennitt. I liked most of INTO THE LABYRINTH. The only track I wasn't too keen on was "The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove". I didn't particularly care for the melody or Brendan's vocals. Overall, INTO THE LABYRINTH is a lush soundscape of Middle Eastern melodies suitable for listening after a long day at the office.

I recently discovered The Puppini Sisters not too long ago when I came across a write up in my local paper. I was immediately intrigued despite the fact that my usual tastes in music is anything pop related or dates back sixty years ago. Without listening to samples of the cd, I bought the cd on a whim. What a joyful surprise I got when I first listened to BETCHA BOTTOM DOLLARS. The music is a throwback to the 1940s when female singers would travel the world and entertain our country's soldiers during wartime. I am normally not into jazz music but I found myself enjoying The Puppini Sisters' music immensely.BETCHA BOTTOM DOLLAR is a collection of pop songs from the past ranging from The Andrew Sisters to Kate Bush. I enjoyed hearing the women harmonizing on all of the songs. Their interpretations of some more modern pop songs like "Heart of Glass" and "I Will Survive" are my personal favorite tracks. It was a bit odd hearing those songs jazzed up a bit but they worked for me. I enjoyed every song on the cd. There was nothing for me to not like. BETCHA BOTTOM DOLLAR is a great alternative to popular music today.

"Timekiller" is the very first song I ever heard by Project Pitchfork. A good friend of mine had burned the song on a compilation cd she made for me years ago. I finally got around to buying Daimonion after all these years. I had to get it because at the time I was getting ready to see the band live at Ground Zero in Minneapolis. All the Project Pitchfork albums that I had listened to (and at one point owned), Daimonion is my personal favorite. The songs are definitely slower than on the other albums that I had heard. Asides "Timekiller", I really enjoy listening to the songs "Jupiter" (a beautiful ballad) and "We Are One". The melodies stands out more with me and the lyrics resonates with me more so than other Project Pitchfork albums. I think the album certainly could have been edited better. I feel like it was a little too long. Fifty-five minutes would have been more appropriate. Overall I enjoy Daimonion immensely.

I am a new fan of Autumn's Grey Solace. A friend of mine gave me a copy of the band's last album "Riverine". I liked what I heard but there wasn't anything that stood out with me from the album. I recently acquired a copy of the band's latest cd "Shades of Grey" and I thought it was a vast improvement over "Riverine". The first thing that I noticed when I started listening to the cd was how similiar the music was akin to the Cocteau Twins and a bit of Mazzy Star. I just love the combination of jangly guitars, Erin's clear ethereal vocals, and infectious melodies. They really worked together this time, making the music more memorable than on the last album. The production is immaculate. This is how recordings should sound. Erin's vocals are as clear as glass. They are not muddled up by over production or under production quality. The music has a nice live sound. The only flaw is that the songs sounds awfully alike but I can forgive the band for that, the music is much better on this album than on their previous. One of my favorite songs has to be the title track. It is upbeat and I just love how catchy the song is. It's a nice way to wake up in the morning. I also love the playful "Fodderwing". Normally I don't like that wispy vocals a lot of female singers have a tendency to sing with but I loved it in this case. The acoustic guitars added a nice touch to the song. I hope Autumn's Grey Solace continues to make albums that are as strong and consistent as "Shades of Grey" is. This would definitely make me a diehard fan.

I first discovered Solar Twins on the soundtrack for that awful Madonna movie THE NEXT BEST THING. The electronica-lite soundtrack was the only good thing to come out of that debacle. My favorite thing about the soundtrack was Solar Twins. I eventually bought Solar Twins their one album they released. I immediately fell in love with the music. The music certainly has a drum and bass element to the group's sound but made more accessible for those who don't care for the repetitiveness of drum and bass. Joanna Stevens' polished pop vocals and delicate melodies are interwoven with the skittering drum and bass beats as well as downtempo grooves. The results is neither pure drum and bass or trip hop music. The music is melodic and never boring to listen to. What drives Solar Twins for me is the smooth and polished vocals by Joanna Stevens. Her voice is never over or underwhelming. Her voice matches well with the music. I love all of the songs on the album. It took me awhile for "Rock the Casbah" to grow on me over the years but now it is just as good as the group's original material. It is a shame that Solar Twins' music never took off. I always felt that they were a vastly underappreciated electronica group that never got the proper push from Madonna's former boutique label (shame on her).

I was very fortunately recently to find a copy of EXCELSIS: A DARK NOEL at my local library last weekend. I have been trying to get a hold of a copy of this version for some time now. Last year Projekt Records had released an updated version of EXCELSIS: A DARK NOEL which included a good number of songs from the 1997 version.I really don't like a lot of Christmas music because they tend to be bland and dull but I really like EXCELSIS because it appeals to the goth in me. EXCELSIS is a compilation of Christmas songs that have been re-interpreted by an array of goth artists courtesy of Projekt Records. The music is exquisite to say the very least. The shoegazing, atmospheric melodies of the likes of Love Spirals Downards ("Welcome Christmas"), and This Ascension ("Carol of the Bells")adds a new dimension to the traditional songs. One of my favorite songs is "The First Noel" by Thanatos. The first time I heard the song I thought it was Voltaire but it isn't. I liked how deep the singer's voice is. SuchiKachis Etbu's version of "Oh Come All Ye Faithful" is quite lovely to listen to. The ethereal vocals matches well with the delicate melodies.I liked most of the songs but there were a few tracks that I could have easily lived without hearing. Arcanta's version of "Carol of the Bells" is dull and lifeless. I definitely preferred This Ascension's version. Eva O's 'unique' interpretation of "O Holy Night" made me cringe. Eva O's voice tends to do that so no points from me for that horrid version. I also disliked a lot Autopsia's "Stille Nacht (g) RAVE remix". The production of the album isn't all that great either.For all the flaws though, I still enjoy listening to EXCELSIS: A DARK NOEL. It is a great take on traditional Christmas music. I definitely recommend this album (if you can find it) for those who like untraditional Christmas music.

There are very few albums in which I can say is absolutely perfect. Most cds I own have a song or two that I don't care for.I can't say the same about the debut album by Conjure One. After his (temporary) split from Delerium, Rhys Fulber created a new project called Conjure One. "Conjure One" is the self-titled debut album from Conjure One. I was fortunate to find a copy of the cd a few days prior to its official release four years ago. The music is as exquisite and beautiful as any Delerium cds. The choices in singers used on the songs is perfect. Each of the women brought something to the table. The music is so soothing and relaxing to listen to after a hard day's work at the office. I like the combination of new age and ambient. It isn't too sappy or too dreary. The lush female vocals are icing on the cake. It is nice to throw this cd into the stereo and kick back with a hot cup of tea. After four years, "Conjure One" remains a personal favorite cd of mine. It still sounds as new and fresh as the day I bought it.

As a weekly treat after their one day fast, I feed my four boys Freeze Dried Bloodworms for Bettas. They are just a weekly treat because they have no nutritional value like their pellets and flakes that I feed them. I am lucky that I have four fish that will eat anything that I put in front of their little snouts. I soak the freeze dried bloodworms in a plastic spoon with a little of their tank water for about 10 seconds. This prevents constipation. Not all bettas will take to freeze dried bloodworms. Some bettas are fussy eaters. LOL! For my boys, they love their bloodworms.

Earlier this spring I discovered a new up and coming goth band via the internet. The band is AZ's own Reliquary. I absolutely loved what I heard on their MySpace profile page. There is a definite operatic sound that is not often heard in goth music. A lot of the credit goes to lead vocalist Kara who has had some sort classical training. Her voice is warm and inviting. "Winter World" is the debut album from Reliquary. The music is as intoxicating as Kara's voice. I was quickly reminded of my personal favorite goth band Diva Destruction. There is a definite Debra Fogarty sound in Kara's vocals. The only difference is the operatic quality. Every song on the cd is beautifully song and written. I love the band's interpretation of Delibes' classic "Lakme (Flower Duet)". They give this immortal classic a gothic twist. Overall great cd. I look forward to hearing more from this talented band in the near future.

I am not a huge fan of opera music. Most of it gets on my nerves but I do like it when opera music is mixed in with a smidgeon of pop music. Amici Forever may not create opera music that is pure but their music is nice to listen to when I just want to unwind after a long day at the office. THE OPERA BAND is the group's first album. I heard about it through a television commercial a few years ago and bought a copy. I like the combination of male and female singers. While the song selection is rather predictable (because they have been covered by other artists in the classical/crossover genre), I thought the group did a good job. I particularly enjoyed their version of "Unchained Melody" and Elgar's "Nimrod". The music is a bit bland and the group offers nothing new that I haven't heard before in the classical/crossover genre, I still enjoy listening to their music. Their fusion of pop and opera helps take off the edge from the dark, heavy music I normally listen to on a regular basis/

I am new to In Strict Confidence. "Where Sun and Moon Unite" is my first ISC cd and "Exit Paradise" is my latest ISP cd. What appealed to me was their song "Promised Land" with Antje Schultz on vocals. I heard this song on the band's MySpace page and immediately fell in love with the song. I loved the melodies, Antje's vocals, and the EBM beats. I must say I like the remixes to "Promised Land" and "Wintermoon" more so than the versions on "Exile Paradise". I definitely preferred the remix version of "Wintermoon" over this album's version because of the vocals and the pace of the song was slightly slower than the remix version. I think my favorite song on the entire cd is "Fading Light". The blend of both Dennis and Antje's vocals really works here the best. The song has a lot of energy. A few of the songs took a few listens for me to get accustom to. Overall solid album. I will definitely have to check out ISP's other cds.

I don't know why I have put off buying this album for so long but I wish I didn't. I finally bought Imperative Reaction's "Redemption" cd. I first heard of the band on the 2004 release of Metropolis's yearly compilation they release. I really liked what I heard on "Giving in to the Change", the song that was on the compilation. I finally bought "Redemption" when I found a used (but in excellent condition) copy at my favorite used cd store. The music is everything that I expected it would be. There is a good mix of melodic futurepop and aggressive electro/industrial beats. Ted Phelps' vocals ranges from clean to distorted. The production is crisp and clean. My favorite song on the entire album has to be "Faded into One". I absolutely love the crisp synth beats and infectious melodies. I hope to get the band's new album "As We Fall" shortly. I definitely have become an Imperative Reaction fan.

I don't know why Amazon has this new project by Rhys Fulber, Bill Leeb, and Leigh Nash listed as Delerium when the project is actually called Fauxliage. Nowhere on the cd packaging does it say Delerium. I think this is why a few people were disappointed with the album. They were expecting another Delerium cd. Having worked with Leigh Nash of Sixpence None the Richer on the last few Delerium albums, Rhys, Bill and Leigh have re-joined forces for a full length album not under the Delerium name but as Fauxliage.I had just heard about this new collaboration a couple of weeks ago. After hearing samples of their new songs, my curiousity was piqued. I have to confess that the album didn't really grab me right from the get go. The songs weren't as tuneful as Rhys and Bill's work as Delerium. I had to listen to the cd a few more times for the music to sink into my head. After a few listens, I began to really enjoy the fusion of pop, ambient, and folk.I never really was a fan of Leigh Nash's work with Sixpence None the Richer but I have always enjoyed her collaborations with Rhys and Bill, especially on FAUXLIAGE. Her distinct vocals sounds much more palatable to the dreamy electronic/pop sounds of Delerium. I like the fact that FAUXLIAGE does not sound like a Delerium album. There is a warmth and organic sound that is rarely heard on Delerium's albums. The lush electronic beats are pure Delerium however the music is fused with guitars, bass, drums, and keyboards.FAUXLIAGE may not be a perfect album but I still enjoy listening to it. The music is pleasant to listen to while drinking a steaming cup of tea and watching the rain gently fall from the sky.

I am really picky about film scores. A lot of film scores I hear are loud, bombastic, and over the top. My favorite film score of all time has to be Jocelyn Pook's compositions for the 2004 film adaptation of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice". Her orchestral compositions really reflects the time period the film takes place in. For me, the gorgeous film score was what made the film so engaging for me. The meldoies were never loud or bombastic like you would hear in John Williams' or Hans Zimmer's work. Andreas Scholl's operatic vocals added a nice touch to Jocelyn Pook's music. Originally I thought Andreas was a she and not a he. His voice is very high for a man and I mean that in a positive way. My favorite track on the album is "Bridal Ballad" with Hayley Westenra. This was my first introduction to Hayley. I must say I was quite impressed. She has a lovely voice that is rarely heard in singers around her age. I wish Britney Spears could sing like that, much less sing like a human and less like a chipmunk.Anyways, I really feel that Jocelyn captured the Shakespeare era that the story was takes place with her music. I hope to hear more from her in the near future.

I recently started getting into the Putumayo series after I heard the Paris compilation. I was immediately hooked and now have started checking out the other cds in the series. MUSIC FROM THE COFFEE LANDS is my latest acquisition. While MUSIC FROM THE COFFEE LANDS may not be my favorite compilation, I certainly enjoyed listening to its international flavor. Most of the songs are latin based but there are a track here and there that are African and even Hawaiian. As I sit here typing my review while drinking a cup of joe and listening to this cd, I am imaging myself in a field picking coffee beans. I find the music very soothing tp the human soul. I definitely agree with one reviewer who questioned why there isn't any music from Ethiopia featured on the compilation given the origins of the almighty and addictive coffee bean. Overall I enjoyed MUSIC FROM THE COFFEE LANDS. It is a nice change of pace from the dark, heavy music I listen to on a regular basis.

There are not many bands nowadays where I wish I had discovered sooner but when I do, they are real treasures. Autumn is definitely a real gem that I sincerely wish I had discovered sooner. I discovered Autumn earlier this spring when they opened up for Faith and the Muse in Minneapolis, and it would turn out that it was the band's final live performance. I finally got around to buying Autumn's second album Return to the Breath. I was definitely not disappointed. I was quickly whisked away to another world when I heard Julie Plante's operatic vocals and Neil McKay's swirling guitar riffs. The band's music in general reminded me of Cocteau Twins with Neil's catchy, jingly guitar riffs. I enjoyed every single track on the album. I remember hearing a few of the songs when the band performed back in April at Ground Zero so it is good to have the album as a memento of the band and the joy their final live performance gave to me. I certainly recommend to my friends to get a copy of Return to the Breath.

I am a big fan of Craig Armstrong's work as a composer and as an artist. I always wanted to hear his work for the Oliver Stone film WORLD TRADE CENTER without having to subject myself to the overacting of Nicholas Cage for two hours plus some minutes. I recently got a hold of a copy of the soundtrack and was completely blown away by the music. What I like about Craig's approach to scoring is that he doesn't go the traditional route of John Williams and Hans Zimmer by creating a repetitious pattern of soft, subtle music to loud, bombastic music. Craig's haunting compositions are never overwhelming to the ears. His music is a mix of ambient and classical music and the results he achieves are emotionally moving to the human soul. Regardless if you have seen the film or not, this soundtrack is worth owning to kick back with some tea and a good book. Very relaxing music.

I love how with every album Loreena McKennitt puts out, her album is the results of her travels all over the world. On her album THE BOOK OF SECRETS (which would be her last studio album for several years before AN ANCIENT MUSE), Loreena explores the history of the celts. When I listen to the cd, I feel like I am getting a history lesson in celtic history. I like that Loreena writes music that is never insulting or trite.Although the album version of "The Mummer's Dance" is a far cry from the radio version, it is nonetheless still a joy to listen to. The album version is longer and slower while the radio versoin is shorter and more upbeat. Me thinks radio wanted a version that would appeal to a broader audience. If that was the case it worked but unfortunately it made people expect that version to be found on THE BOOK OF SECRETS. My personal favorite track on the album is the haunting ballad "Dante's Prayer" which was inspired by a trip across Siberia during one winter on a train, and the book DANTE'S INFERNO. I lke how minimal the use of instruments are on this particular track, allowing Loreena's warm voice to be the center of attention. The rest of the album is just as wonderful. The richly detailed lyrics and the lush, haunting celtic melodies makse for a wonderful combination. THE BOOK OF SECRETS have really grown on me over the years and is now a steadfast favorite in my itunes library and stereo.

I am a new fan to De/vision. I had always wanted to check out their music. After seeing the group live back in February, I became a big fan of the long running synthpop group. VOID is my second (and it won't be my last) De/vision album that I just bought. I have to admit the guitar orientated sounds of VOID is quite a contrast from their latest album NOOB (I'll admit it is the only other De/vision album I own). Initially I didn't know what to think of VOID but as I continue to listen to it, the more I enjoy this different side to De/vision. Without a doubt I do prefer the band's more synth-driven sounds over this brief foray into alternative rock. Some of the songs worked and some didn't. I wasn't particularly keen on "Ride on a Star" which I didn't think had any melody. VOID isn't totally deVOID of De/vision's synthpop roots. There definitely are synthpop elements in all of their songs like "Anywhere" and especially "Blue Moon [Void Style-Version]". The production on VOID is certainly a lot more raw and often sounds like a live album than on what I am used to hearing on NOOB. It was nice to hear De/vision's music with a less polished sound than what I am used to hearing. VOID is different and the foray into rock music occasionally waivers but for the most part I liked the album.

I recently had the displeasure of seeing Marie Antoinette over the weekend. I knew before seeing the film that it was going to be a fluff piece judging by all the negative reviews I had read. So it didn't come as a shock to me to see how bad this film is. It is a shame that this film is a major disappointment. I love Sophia Coppola's other films. Marie Antoinette is a turkey compared to Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation."Marie Antoinette" is based on the Antonia Fraser biography "Marie Antoinette: the Journey". Unfortunately this film only focuses on Marie Antoinette's life as a queen. The film makes no mention of her childhood or what follows after the queen and king are evacuated from their home during the French Revolution. Do not expect a character study in this fluff piece of a biopic. The film does not present Marie Antoinette as a complicated individual as Antonia Fraser's novel does. Sophia Coppola presents her as Paris Hilton of her era.My biggest issues with this turkey is: a) the lack of foreign accents, and b) the inclusion of modern music. Since when did Marie Antoinette speak with an American accent? Was Sophia Coppola too darn lazy to make her cast to learn to speak a different accent other than their own?!Kirsten Dunst's lack of an Austrian accent did not make for a convincing performance. I also did not like Kirsten as Marie Antoinette altogether. Reese Witherspoon or Scarlett Johanssen would have a been a better choice. Secondly, I love the '80s. I love The Cure. I love Siouxsie & The Banshees. This type of music did not belong in a period film. This collection of '80s music made the film feel like one extended music video. The writing was weak. The film was truly lacking in a direction. I don't even think there was much of a plot to the story. The only thing I liked about this otherwise dreadful film was the costumes otherwise this was a major dissapointment from a talented filmmaker.

This week I had the pleasure of seeing The Echoing Green perform live in Minneapolis with Freezepop and some local bands. While at the show I picked up a copy of The Winter of Our Discontent by The Echoing Green and Pristina's Stars and Sirens. Pristina is Joey Belville's side project featuring an array of female vocalists whose vocals are set to laid back downtempo electronic beats. I have really been enjoying Stars and Sirens a lot. The music is very relaxing and soothing to chill out to. I enjoyed all the singers featured on the album. There is not a single track on the album that I did not enjoy.

2007 has been a rather dismal year for films for me. Thankfully the few I have seen this year have all been gems. My personal favorite film released this year is the latest anime film from Satoshi Kon called PAPRIKA. The film is loosely based on the graphic novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui. The story centers around the theft of the DC Mini, a technological device that allows the medical community to enter the dreams of their patients to help with their psychological issues. When the DC Mini is stolen, chaos ensues when people's dreams begins to collide with reality no thanks to the thief.Megumi Hayashibara is the voice of Paprika/Atsuko, the protangonist of the film. Paprika is the cyber alter ego of Dr. Atsuko. Paprika is young, 18 year old, free spirited young woman while Atsuko is more serious and overly cautious. Atsuko is assisted in the pursuit of the thief by Tokita, a morbidly obese man who is a genius yet lacks the maturity that Atsuko possesses; and her boss Shima.Just like the GHOST IN THE SHELL films, I had to view PAPRIKA a couple of more times to really grasp what really went on through the film. The animation was breathtaking. I loved the vibrant colors. The music was also fantastic. The music is an eclectic mix of techno/pop, jazz, and classical. The music and animation really made this film such a treat for me to watch. The writing was great too. I liked that the story touched on the influence of science and technology in our lives and how much should humans let them have on our lives.The bonus dvd features are worth checking out. There are interviews with Tsutsui, Satoshi Kon, and the visual artist responsible for the gorgeous animation. Granted seeing PAPRIKA on dvd is nothing compared to having seen it in the theatre myself but it is still a movie worth watching.

PAN'S LABYRINTH is one of the best films I have seen in the past five years. The blending of fantasy with the ugliness of reality really captured my heart. One of the reasons was because of Javier Navarrete's gorgeous film score. The melody of the score is based on the lullaby that Mercedes sings to Ophelia when she has to move to a separate room away from her mother who is put on bed rest. The music flows effortlessly together. Javier's excellent compositions reminds me of John Williams and Hans Zimmer but more subtle and not so loud and bombastic during the intense scenes. I don't know if PAN'S LABYRINTH would have been as good if the director had gone with another composer. Javier's music really captured the essence of the film whether the scenes were treading in the brutal reality of the Spanish civil war or in the fantasy world of the faun. I hope that after the success of PAN'S LABYRINTH, the public will be hearing more from Javier Navarrete. His work in the Guillermo del Toro film is simply one of the best film scores I have heard in the past decade.

Not long ago, my Sony boombox finally decided that it didn't like playing the cds I would put in after 3 years. It would either stop playing the cd altogether or simply pause. Anyways it was annoying and I decided to get a new boombox. I decided on the Sony CFDG505 Cassette Recorder Boombox because it had one of the higher ratings, plus I liked what a lot of reviewers said about the sound. After a couple of months, my boombox is still performing very well. I really like how my cds sound when I listen to them. It sounds so much better than my old cheap Sony boombox. The CDFG505 may not be physically attractive but I don't mind. It is the performance I am more concerned with and I was not disappointed.

"Little Miss Sunshine" is a delightful, quirky summer comedy starring Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear. Toni and Greg plays the married couple Sheryl and Richard. They are raising two children together Olive (Abigail Breslin) and Dwayne (Paul Dano). It is implied in the film but never really said for sure that Richard isn't the children's father. The film does make a brief mention that Sheryl is divorced. Alan Arkin is the irreprehensible but loveable foul-mouthed, heroin snorting grandfather who lives with the brood because he was kicked out of his retirement home. Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrell) comes to live with the family after he is discharged from the mental institution after he had attempted suicide. This family puts the fun in dysfunctional with all their insecurities and other emotional issues that plagues them.The premise of the film has the entire family go on a road trip to California where Olive had been declared winner of a local beauty pagent by default and is one of the contestants for the final competition in Redondo, California. Most of the film revolves around the car trip. All of the family's neuroses comes to head. Everything that could go possibly go wrong on a car trip did go wrong for Sheryl and Richard.This was a terribly funny film and a lot of the credit goes to Alan Arkin as the heroin snorting grandpa who steals every scene he is in. Normally teenage angst in most films are over the top and so stereotypical but Paul Dano's performance as the Nietzsche-loving Dwayne was spot on. For most of the film, Dwayne was silent because he took a vow of silence until he achieved his goal. Despite his pessimistic view of his family, he still loved them. Steve Carrell was hilarious as Frank. I loved the scene where he matches wit with Richard in the VW van. Toni Collette was wonderful as Sheryl. She has quickly become of my favorite actresses. The films she choses to work in are impeccable and as Sheryl her performance certainly deserves to be recognized by the Golden Globes and/or the Oscars. Finally there is the irresistable Olive who is nothing more than a bundle of energy and is a real treat to watch in every scene. Her scenes in the last ten minutes of the film were hilarious."Little Miss Sunshine" is proof that summer films don't need special effects or big name actors. "Little Miss Sunshine" proves that all you really need is a really good script and actors who are able to stay true to form as the characters they embody.

I was at my local public library today when I came across Ishtar's "La Voix d'Alabina" in the world music section. The picture of an attractive blonde haired woman piqued my curiousity. On a whim I decided to check out the cd thinking that the music might be similiar to Kylie Minogue's. How wrong was I. "La Voix d'Alabina" turned out to be a seductive and diverse mix of modern pop, French, and Middle Eastern music. I even recognized one of the songs "Comme Toi" which can be heard on one of the Buddha Bar compilations. I was immediately hooked on this relatively obscure gem from six years ago. I like Ishtar's vocals. They are polished and with a hint of a French accent. One of my favorite songs is "Last Kiss" with its seductive Middle Eastern groove which makes me want to get up and dance. "Last Kiss" is a beautiful ballad. The song sounds like it belongs in a Hiyao Miyazaki animated film with its sweeping melodies and haunting lyrics. I am so glad I checked out this cd. I love all of the songs on the album.

I first became familiar with Azam Ali through her work with Vas. I was immediately enchanted by the lovely Middle Eastern melodies and Azam's sensuous vocals. Not too long ago, I got her first solo album "Portals of Grace" which I immediately fell in love with. I recently came across Azam's latest solo album "Elysium for the Brave" at my local library. I have to admit that I prefer the celtic-influenced sounds of "Portals of Grace" and Vas'last cd "Feast of Silence". I don't know why but the songs on "Elysium for the Brave" didn't stick out with me as much as the other cds I have by her. Her music is good. Azam has a gorgeous voice which is a lot better than say Kelly Clarkson. Her vocals matches well with the subtle dance beats. I appreciate that her voice takes front and center on the cd while the dance beats plays second fiddle.I find "Elysium for the Brave" very relaxing to listen to on a cold winter night like tonight however there isn't anything on this cd that I haven't heard before, plus the songs sounded too much alike.

I finally found another Putumayo cd that is as good as their Greek compilation. From the moment I first listened to ACOUSTIC AFRICA, I knew that this album was going to receive as much play in my stereo and on my ipod. This isn't my first glimpse into African music but it certainly is the first time that music from Africa has really stuck with me. I immensely enjoyed "Sedjedo" by Angelique Kidjo. I love the harmonies between Angelique and her back up singers. I also enjoyed the gentle beats of the percussion instruments. The harmonies on all of the songs are wonderful. They match well with the dextrous acoustic skills of the artists or the musicians they work with. There is not one song on the album that I didn't like. Putumayo does it again and put out another great compilation of world music.

PARIS is the first compilation in the Putumayo series that I really took a shine to. The first cd in the series I heard was ARABIC GROOVE earlier this year but I was bored with it. It wasn't until the PARIS compilation did I realize how great Putumayo series is.PARIS is a delightful compilation of Parisian music from the Nouvelle Scene (new scene). When I listen to the cd, I feel like I am sitting outside of a Parisian cafe. The music is very mellow. It is a mix of folk and pop with a French twist. Although I do not understand the French language, I nevertheless love listening to the language the artists sings in. One of my personal favorite songs on the album is "Quelqu'un M'a Dit" by Carla Bruni, the latest wife of France's president. Normally I get turned off when models try to sing (or act) but with Carla she surprised me by showing that she is more than a capable artist. I also enjoyed the songs by Coralie Clement and Aldebert in particular. There is not a single track on the album that I didn't like.

This past spring I saw the film adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's THE NAMESAKE. I enjoyed the film so much I decided to read the novel the film was based on.THE NAMESAKE revolves around the Ganguli family. Ashoke and his wife Ashima had immigrated to the United States in the late 1960s in search of a better life. Ashoke had taken a job as a teacher at MIT. The couple has two children son Gogol (who was named after Nikolai Gogol) and daughter Sonia. Most of the book revolves around the couple's son Gogol who grows up being taught traditional Indian culture in America. Eventually Gogol becomes conflicted between his parents' roots and his American roots.I personally enjoyed the book more than the film (although it was quite good). The book delves more into Gogol's life as a young man which parts were not included in the film. There were moments in the story when it veered off into soap opera territory which I didn't particularly care for. I also didn't like how women were written by the author. I didn't think they were fleshed out enough by the author to make them remotely likeable or compelling enough. For all its foibles, THE NAMESAKE was a great read for me.

Essexx is a new project by Prussian artists Sara Noxx and Sven Wolff of Dust of Basement. BRIDGES LIMITED is the final results of the musical collaboration between the two talented artists. Unfortunately this album took me what seemed like an eternity to get but the music made the long wait well worth the wait and money. I ordered through another site which offered this cd at a cheaper price than what Amazon.com.There are two discs on BRIDGES LIMITED. One consists of original compositions and the second disc consists of remixes by industrial heavyweights like Feindflug, XP8, X-FUSION, and Culture Kultur. The original compostions are catchy electro-pop songs that reminded me of Soft Cell, Erasure, and early Depeche Mode. I love Sara Noxx's gentle, whispery, seductive vocals. They match well with the mid-tempo dance beats. I love all of the songs on the album but I have to say that the original versions of "Love Affair" and "Undercover" really stood out for me on disc 1. Tom Shears of Assemblage 23 makes a guest appearance on "Undercover". I love the melodies and Sara and Tom's vocals are on the songs, especially Sara's vocals. Why Sara isn't more well known in the states as an artist is beyond me.The remixes on disc two are surprisingly good. I usually don't like it when artists includes remixes but in this case, I loved the contrast of the remixed vs. the original electro-pop sounds of the songs. The remixes gives the songs a more EBM vibe which would please any EBM fan.If you have the time and money, BRIDGES LIMITED is definitely worth acquiring for anyone's music collection. I can't say I would recommend buying the cd via Amazon when you can get it cheaper at Metropolis Records (sorry Amazon.com). The wait may be longer but paying an extra $8 here isn't worth it for anyone on a budget.Track List:01. I feel everything02. Freezing03. Follow Me04. Caroline05. Love Affairs06. Electrified07.

WELCOME TO EARTH was the very first Apop album as well as my first taste of music from Metropolis Records. I bought WELCOME TO EARTH by accident when I was thinking of another artist at the time back in 2001 or 2002. The second I heard the opening track "Everything We Know is Wrong", I knew I was in for a real treat. WELCOME TO EARTH really opened my eyes to the world of industrial music and EBM in general. I loved how much the music had a obvious trance influence in the crisp, melodic synth beats. At the time I was a big trance fanatic so it was obvious that I would love WELCOME TO EARTH. The album isn't by all means flawlesss. There are a few songs on the album that I am either not fond of or think that they are only so-so. Personally 7 is my favorite Apop album. That album had better songs than WELCOME TO EARTH which is a just a bit too polished at times. Still WELCOME TO EARTH has some timeless music that I can never tire of listening to like "Starsign" and "Fade to Black" (a killer cover of the Metallica song).

I love my slowcooker. I am constantly in search of finding new recipes to use my slowcooker (at any time of the year). I came across Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Recipes for Two at my parents' house a couple of Christmases ago and started flipping through it. I ended up asking for my own copy for this past Christmas. I absolutely love this cookbook. I have already made a few of the recipes including the beef short ribs with dried apricots and the Greek chicken with feta cheese. The results have been all delicious so far. I like that in some recipes the author mentions what kind of red wine (like in the one for the beef short ribs with dried apricots) to use. The recipes are pretty easy and the ingredients are definitely easy to find in your local supermarket. I definitely recommend this cookbook for anyone who loves using their slowcookers.

Tara MacLean is one of those artists whose name I am aware of but never paid much attention. It wasn't until I heard her song "Here and Now" recently on a compilation cd did I decided to check out her music. I recently acquired a copy of Tara's PASSENGER cd. PASSENGER is definitely typical singer/songwriter fodder that one would hear on adult contemporary radio stations. The music is a bit bland and predictable but overall there was enough songs on the album that I liked to give this album four stars. There were a couple of songs that I didn't like because of the lack of decent melodies, or that the song sounded out of place on the album like "Shakota". My personal favorite song on the album is the gorgeous piano ballad "Settling". The poignant melodies and sparse piano melodies really hit an emotional chord with me. My other favorite song on the album is "La Tempete". I really liked the melodic pop hooks and the lyrics. PASSENGER may not be perfect and is a bit on the dull side but I did enjoy it. Tara MacLean does have a pleasant voice and does show a good deal of talent as a singer/songwriter.

Ever since I had the pleasure of seeing De/vision in concert earlier this year, I have started to buy their previous albums. My latest De/vision purchase is their 2006 release SUBKUTAN. While NOOB remains my favorite De/vision album, SUBKUTAN is still good and superior to VOID (my previous De/vision purchase). My biggest flaw with the album is the inclusion of remixes. I am not convinced that they were necessary. They weren't bad but they didn't do anything for me. I really couldn't tell each remix from each other. Remixes aside, I enjoy SUBKUTAN immensely. I thought the music is a precursor to what to expect on NOOB. Songs like "No Tomorrow" and "Still Unknown" shared some of the laid back synthpop beats and haunting lyrics that permeated NOOB. There were a couple of tracks that I had to listen to a few times for them to grow on me like "Addict" and "The End". The melodies were a bit too sparse for me initially. I also enjoyed the drum and bass influenced "E-Shock". The skittish electronic beats proves that De/vision isn't strictly synthpop. SUBKUTAN may not be completely flawless but I find the album quite satisfying to listen to.

"Marie Antoinette: the Journey" is the inspiration behind Sophia Coppola's biopic about the infamous queen of France. The film was terrible mainly because the writing really doesn't go in depth into Marie Antoinette's personal life as the daughter of Maria Teresa, the empress of Austria and the wife of Louis XVI. Antoinia Fraser does an immense amount of research for her biography on Marie Antoinette. Having read Antonia Fraser's excellent biography, I had learned that Marie Antoinette was a far more complicated individual than I saw on the big screen and a lot of that is due to her relationship with her mother. Maria Teresa pretty much ran the family as well as the country (behind closed doors). She used her daughters as pawns in her foreign affairs.Marie Antoinette was the youngest of fifteen children who was married off to the Dauphin of France, Louis XVI in hopes to secure a stable relationship with France, if not a future for Austria. Unfortunately the marriage didn't start off on the right foot. It took eight years for the couple to finally produce a heir. Then there was Marie Antoinette's reckless love of socializing, spending, and gambling that reminded this reader of Paris Hilton except for the queen's last few years of life.I was really impressed by the amount of work Antonia Fraser put into her biography on "Marie Antoinette". Although she could not confirm the series of unsubstantiated rumors about Marie's sexual promiscuity, she certainly paints Marie Antoinette as more than some frivolous Paris Hilton harlot so unlike Sophia Coppola in her film. I personally believe that Marie Antoinette became the woman that she was because of the strict, rigid upbringing her mother Maria Teresa subjected to her, and once she moved away to get married to Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette decided to rebel against her rigid upbringing which unfortunately led to her and her husband's downfall.I wish that Sophia Coppola didn't focus her film strictly on Marie Antoinette's life as a young queen. I really liked reading about her childhood. For anyone who has seen or wants to see Sophia Coppola's film, I strongly recommend reading the book first. The book is so much more informative and fascinating than the film itself.

I was perusing the cd racks last weekend at my local public library when I stumbled upon "Outside Looking In: The Best of The Gin Blossoms". The Gin Blossoms immediately conjured up fond memories of my post high school/early college years. I was in on the band long before "Hey Jealousy" became a huge smash for the band. So nostalgic for the past, I checked out the cd. I almost forgot just how catchy the band's music was. They were candy for my ears. The band really had a knack for cracking out one catchy pop/rock song after another. Sure the band had a few misses too. I never liked "Mrs. Rita". That has always been my least favorite Gin Blossom song because it is so devoid of a good pop hook. I was so pleased that the band included my personal favorite songs "Cajun Song" and "Until I Fall Away" (which I always liked more than the overplayed "Hey Jealousy"). I'm glad I picked up "Outside Looking In". It brought back memories of life that was simpler (and devoid of bills and rent).

For some time now I have been meaning to check out Natacha Atlas's music but never got around to it. I finally did when I came across "Something Dangerous" cd at my local library this weekend. I am was quite surprised to hear quite a bit of modern pop music on this cd, not that it is a bad thing. I just didn't expect a poppish sound. I absolutely love the opening track "Adam's Lullaby" a beautiful ballad that she and Jocelyn Pook (the film composer for "The Merchant of Venice")worked on together. I especially loved Natacha's fragile vocals. "Eye of the Ducky" has a hip hop flavor with maybe a hint of reggae but the song still maintains its Middle Eastern sound. The hip hop influence adds an interesting twist to the overall sound of the album. It had a good beat. I like it quite a bit. The title track has a laid back r&b groove. Just like on "Eyes of the Duck", the song features Princess Julianna on vocals. Loved "Just Like a Dream" and "Simple Heart". I wasn't too terribly keen on "Janamaan". The vocals were repetitive and the beats well sounded pretty average for me. Overall I enjoyed the album even though it wasn't what I expected for it to sound like.

I think it was back in November when I first saw a trailer for the Michael Haneke film Das Weisse Band (The White Ribbon). Initially the film appeared uninteresting but when I saw a trailer for it again in December I really paid attention to it and I thought to myself as soon as it opens up in Minneapolis, I will go see the film.I recently went to see The White Ribbon this month and I found myself constantly thinking about it after I left the theater. The time period of the film takes place just a year before World War I in a small German village. The village is plagued by a series of strange events that leads to human suffering. First the village's doctor is seriously injured when his horse trips over a thin wire. The doctor has to spend a lengthy time in the hospital. Another strange incident involves the baron's son who goes missing and is later found bound and tortured. A similar incident involving the midwife's mentally handicapped son occurs. Also a suicide, a barn burns down, and a young boy is restrained to his bed for admitting he self pleasuring himself happens through out the film. A lot of these strange events (not all though) somehow involves some of the children in the village led by the pastor's eldest daughter Klara.What makes this film so compelling and engaging is that the filmmaker does make this film a who done it? type of mystery but rather focus on human nature and just the levels of cruelty that some people (young and old) are willing to go. The one thing about the film that I didn't particularly care for was the narration. I could have easily done without that but I suppose if the film did not have the teacher's narration (when he is older) it would have left a void in the film. At times the film prodded a little too slowly but overall I enjoyed the film immensely.

I am not really familiar with Cesium 137. Other than hearing one song by them on a Metropolis Records compilation, "Intelligent Design" is pretty much a new listening experience for me. I came across this cd by accident in the used cd bins at my local record store. Being a huge fan of Metropolis Records, I bought the cd on whim. I haven't looked back since this past spring when I bought it. "Intelligent Design" blew me away. I absolutely loved the thoughtful mix of trance and EBM. Most of the music is more trance orientated but there is a definite EBM sound in the music. The songwriting on the cd is excellent. There is a definite emotional aspect in the songs."Intelligent Design" kicks off with the awesome "Forsaken", an epic dance song that is sure to fill the dancefloor at nightclubs. The song has a lot of energy and pop hooks. The song is followed up by one of my personal favorite songs "Hollow". The melancholy lyrics and vocals are simply transcending. "Gravity" picks up where "Hollow" leaves off. All the songs on "Intelligent Design" are special in their own right. The production is crisp and immaculate. This is how goth, industrial, EBM cds should sound.Cesium 137 certainly converted this new listener into a fan. I easily rate "Intelligent Design" as one of the top 10-20 cds of 2006.

A couple of months ago I heard samples of the new album BEAUTIFUL TRAGEDY by the heavy metal band In This Moment. I have to admit the samples didn't do the album justice because I was turned off by the distorted, coarse vocals by Maria Brink. I recently acquired a copy of the band's cd and much to my surprise I found myself enjoying In This Moment's music a lot more than I expected. I like the mix of clean and distorted vocals. Normally I am not a huge fan of female singers screaming until their lungs explode but I actually can tolerate Maria's screaming. Maybe the music are cliched especially the thrash driven guitar riffs but I liked what I heard on BEAUTIFUL TRAGEDY. The band never sacrifices an ounce of melody or aggressive nature of their nature. My personal favorite songs on the album has Maria singing through out the entire songs like on "Prayers" and "The Legacy of Odio". I also love the acoustic ballad "When the Storm Subsides". What a great contrast to the heavier tracks. Personally I think BEAUTIFUL TRAGEDY is a great album. I didn't think I would like it as much as I do.

Blutengel has quickly become of my personal favorite goth/industrial bands over the years. A lot of the credit goes to Chris Pohl's talents as a songwriter as well as a vocalist. Earlier this year I came across this rare gem ENGELSSCHREI by his former band Seelenkrank at a local record store and for less than five bucks. Of course I had to buy it since I assumed that it is a hard to find album.For Blutengel fans who are unfamiliar to Seelenkrank (like I was), the music is definitely nothing like the addictively catchy music of Blutengel. Chris' vocals are not as deep as they are now. Chris growls more than he sings here. The production is pretty shoddy here as opposed to the grandeur sounds of Blutengel's recent albums. There are definite elements of what is to come for Chris's future in music. The delicate melodies and pulsating dance beats on"Meine Liebe" certainly is reminiscent of what I would hear on a Blutengel cd.ENGELSSCHREI took me some time for the music to grow on me. The music isn't nearly as catchy as Blutengel's music but it isn't devoid of any melodies. As a Chris Pohl fan, hearing his earlier work with one of his first bands was a real treat for me.

I love Collide. I love Curve. Imagine if both bands collaborated...oh wait, they have but without singer Toni Halliday. Ex-Curve guitarist Dean Garcia and kaRIN and Statik from Collide have joined forces and have created a new project called The Secret Meeting. ULTRASHIVER is the results of the supergroup's collaboration. The music is eerily reminiscent of both Collide and Curve which for me is trip hop and altenative rock. There is even a hit of Cocteau Twins thrown in intermittenly in the music. Actually I think The Secret Meeting sounds more like Collide with a hint of Curve influences. The music took several listens for it to grow on me. The more I listen to it, the more I have grown to love it. kaRIN sounds wonderful as ever with her whispery, seductive vocals. The only flaw with the music (which is pretty minor in my opinion) is repetition. There is nothing particularly distinctive about each song that separates them from each other. The songs are definitely good but they sound too much alike. Overall I do enjoy "Ultrashiver" immensely. I hope this collaboration continues on, along with the members' other projects.

I am a huge Sara Noxx fan. I have been a big fan of her brand of synthpop for a couple of years ago. I first found her through Myspace and since then I have been hooked. Unfortunately Sara's music is extremely difficult to find in the United States. I had to shell out a pretty penny for her best of compilation. Thankfully that wasn't the case with EXXTASY. I recently found a cheap copy on the internet and I was not disappointed by it. EXXTASY is 54 minutes of melodic synthpop. The throbbing synth beats are never overwhelming. They do not overwhelm Sara's whispery vocals. Sara's lyrics are like poetry like in the song "Last Desire" with the line "My Heart is still on fire. I kiss you goodbye". I also like this like this line "The words that you whisper I refuse to believe. I will surive" from the song "Survive". The melodies are just as beautiful. A lot of the songs are midtempo but there are some killer dance tracks like "Exxtasy" with its club thumping dance beats. I love all thirteen tracks. Too bad Sara's music is difficult to find or expensive. If you can find EXXTASY at a decent price, it is definitely worth the money.Track List:01. Survive02. Gold (Feel the Fever)03. Last Desire04.

I am a big fan of the Austrian industrial/electro band L'ame Immortelle. The only problem is their music isn't or wasn't available at a decent price here in America. Not too long ago, the band finally re-issued their early work at a more affordable cost. One of the cds by them I wanted was "Lieder Die Wie Wunden Bluten" because I heard the lovely ballad "Life Will Never Be the Same Again" on the band's MySpace page and just had to have the cd. I have to say that "Lieder Die Wie Wunden Bluten" took me a few listens for the music to grow on me. The problem lies in the gutteral, cookie monster vocals of Hannes Medwenitsch which I found absolutely annoying. This is one of those rare situations where I prefer the band's more recent works than their older material, and this certainly applies here to L'Ame Immortelle's LIEDER DIE WUNDER BLUTTEN. I really wanted to like this album as much as their recent material but I honestly can't.

Sequels are hit and miss nowadays. I was a bit wary but still excited when "Underworld" was going to have a spin-off. Thankfully my wariness was unfounded with "Underworld: Evolution". The war between death dealers (vampires) and lycans (werewolves) continues on. The film opens up with a flashback to the beginning of the feud between the two clans. Kate Beckinsale returns as the heroine Selene and Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin who is a hybrid mix between vampire and werewolf. Together they are on a quest to stop Marcus Corvinus (Tony Curran) from releasing his imprisoned lycan brother William as well as to unlock the secrets to their respective clans' past.I personally found "Underworld: Evolution" much more engaging than the original. The storyline was more developed than the original. I love cinematography. The blue light captured the dark undertones of the story. The action sequences were far more exciting. I loved the opening sequence. I wish there was more told about both clans and what eventually led to their centuries old feud. Hopefully there will be a prequel to the series. It would answer everyone's questions.

I am not a big fan of heavy metal. I hated the '80s hair metal scene when I was in high school. I hated the nu metal schtick of the late '90s, early '00s. The only metal genre I enjoy is the gothic metal genre which has been around longer than Evanescence (who contrary to what some people might think, did not originate the goth metal sound...The Gathering is credited for creating the goth metal sound).One of my favorite goth metal bands who I think have never really been recognized is the german band Elis. I discovered Elis accidently in the back pages of Outburn magazine (when it was STILL cool). I immediately went out to purchase the band's 2nd album "Dark Clouds in a Perfect Sky". There is a definite resemblence of Leaves' Eyes Liv Kristine in the voice of Sabine Duenser. Both women share that same delicate voice. The music is though a lot more aggressive IMO. The aggressive guitar riffs compliments Sabine's angelic vocals. A lot of that credit goes to producer Alexander Krull (Atrocity), Liv's husband. His production abilities are immaculate. His work on Elis' album as well as with his wife's albums are perfectly crisp and clean without being overly produced.Some of the stand out tracks on "Dark Clouds in a Perfect Sky" are the ballads. "Perfect Love" and "Ballade" has that perfect combination of melody and sorrow without losing out that aggressive edge. I absolutely love working out to the aggressive track "Anger" or if I lose my temper, I often crank up this song and start taking out my anger to this song. Elis's sound may not be terribly original but they certainly know how to keep the goth metal genre from becoming bland and predictable.It deeply saddens me to note mention this news. The heavy metal scene has lost one of its own. Elis lead singer Sabine Duenser recently passed away not even a week ago due to a cerebal hemorrage. This young woman had shown a lot of promise and had a bright future. You were loved and will be forever missed. RIP Sabine :(.

After seeing Paul Potts on tv and youtube, I just had to check out his album ONE CHANCE. Although I am not a big fan of classical crossover music as I once was, I thought Paul had a wonderful voice and I had to hear his debut album. I don't know what I was expecting but I was rather left unimpressed. Yes Paul has a good voice as a tenor however the material picked out for his album was bland and predictable. Most of these songs on ONE CHANCE can be heard on albums by Il Divo and Josh Groban. From my personal standpoint, I have heard these songs a gazillion times on other classical crossover albums and frankly I am tired of hearing them. I am particularly tired of hearing every classical crossover artist cover "Nella Fantasia" and "You Raise Me Up". Talk about beating an expired horse. There is nothing risk taking about the songs here. I didn't think REM's "Everybody Hurts" made for a good operatic song. Sorry Paul but you totally stripped the essence and beauty of that song. In Paul's defense, he probably had to pick songs that the general public would be familiar in order to sell records. I really wanted to like this album more but I couldn't. ONE CHANCE isn't horrible in comparison to most mainstream pop music but I just found the album bland and predictable.

I recently had the immense pleasure of seeing Anything Box perform live in Minneapolis. At the show they had a few cds for sale, I quickly bought a copy of Elektrospective since I already owned copies of Recovered and Future Past EP. I was hoping they would have copies of their other albums but they didn't but ultimately my disappointment faded away. I have been enjoying Elekrospective immensely. The songs are addictive. The pop hooks just sticks with you like some sort of mental glue. This is what great pop music should sound like, infectious pop hooks and smart, thoughtful lyrics. I really enjoyed the songs "Lady in Waiting" and "Soldier and Child". There is not a single track on the album that I did not like. The band performed most if not all of the songs on this album so I immediately recognized them the first time I listened to it. I certainly recommend this album to any fan of early Depeche Mode, Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, and Yaz.

Earlier this year I was so pleased to hear that former Switchblade Symphony member Tina Root had a formed a new band called Tre Lux. I always admired her when she was in Switchblade Symphony. I recently acquired Tre Lux's album "A Strange Gathering" a few days ago. Even though I am a bit dismissive whenever artists do a cover album but not in Tre Lux's case. After hearing samples of her cd on the internet, I knew "A Strange Gathering" was going to be something special. Tina Root does a fantastic job of re-interpreting 12 classic modern rock songs including a song by her former band. I really love her versions of "Never Let Me Down Again", "Yellow", "Every Day is Halloween", and "Run". While I loved her unique interpretations on these songs, it would have been nice to have heard one or two original Tre Lux compositions. Hopefully for the next Tre Lux cd, the music will be all original songs.

Ever since I have heard the live version of "Blue Room", I have been on a Kirlian Camera kick. ERINNERUNG is my latest Kirlian Camera album I had bought not long ago. I must confess I didn't take to ERINNERUNG like I did with PICTURES FROM ETERNITY. I had to listen to the album a half dozen times for the music to grow on me. The music wasn't as melodic as PICTURES FROM ETERNITY. Then there were the repetitive beats like on "Erinnerung-v.1". I felt like a jackhammer was pounding incessantly into my head. The same can be said for the second version of "Erinnerung". Both versions of the song is dull and repetitive.Thankfully the annoying beats is quickly made up by songs like "Schliesse Mie Die Augen Beide", "Days of Laura Zero", and "Sea of Memory". I like the quirky melodies in "the 1st Corridor". I particularly enjoyed Emilia Lo Jacono's vocals on "Schliesse Mie Die Augen Deide", one of my personal favorite tracks on the album. Another great song on the album is the instrumental "Days of Laura Zero". I thought the classical melodies had a nice Parisian flair to them. My other personal favorite track is the acoustic ballad "Sea of Memory". Asides from the title track, I also did not care for "The 1st Corridor". I didn't particularly care for the melodies which was a bit weird and quirky for my tastes. While I don't think ERINNERUNG is bad, I also can't say that it is nearly as good as PICTURES FROM ETERNITY. Nevertheless I am glad to have expanded my Kirlian Camera exposure to more than one album.

When I was in college in the late '90s, I discovered British pop band Saint Etienne at a local independent record store. I loved their brand of kitschy retro dance/pop. It was pop music without a shadow of a doubt but without being obnoxious (like Britney Spears and her ilk). I quickly became a fan. Unfortunately over the years my infatuation with the band waned and I moved on to other forms of music.A month ago I re-discovered the band on a British compilation which featured "You're in a Bad Way". I was quickly reminded how much I had enjoyed their music and recently got a hold of a copy of the band's only US best of compilation TRAVEL EDITION 1990-2005. I admit I was immensely disappointed that my favorite tracks "Bad Photographer" and "Pale Movie" were not included on the album. I especially adore the techo-ish sounding "Pale Movie". Asides the exclusion of those tracks, I was pretty satisfied with the overall compilation. I was particularly pleased to see "He's On the Phone" (the very first Saint Etienne song I heard). While I have heard most of the songs on the compilation there were some I hadn't heard so they were new to me. I enjoyed those songs as well.TRAVEL EDITION is a great reminder why I always liked Saint Etienne. The vastly underrated pop band (in my opinion) made great catchy music. This album is not only a great way to re-introduce old fans to the band but also as an introduction to new fans.
