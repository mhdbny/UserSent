In Meet the Musicians we are introduced to 15 member if the New York Philharmonic. They tell us there stories of how they found out they really wanted to be professionals.The book included a helpful glossary and a list of resources for learining.Young musicians will gain useful advise from the pro in this book.

Curious George is on another adventure. This time he's in my favorite place, the library. The man with the yellow hat has brought George to the library for story time. He likes the books but sees one on dinosaurs that he hopes the librarian reads next. He gets impatient, takes the book and runs off. This is the beginning of his adventure. He goes through the library finding neat books and making a big mess in the process. The boys and girls at the library, along with a volunteer help clean up the mess. In the end the man with the yellow hat helps George get a library card and they both check out lots of great books.I liked the story and the pictures in the book. It's another great adventure with Curious George.I would recommed this book to others. It can be used with young children who are just learning about the library. It would make a great read for storytimes.

Runny Babbit and his friends Toe Jurtle, Skertie Gunk, Goctor Doose, and Millie Woose, have lots of adventures. Some of them include going to the doctor, learning to knit and get a hair cut. The first letter to some of the word in each poems are switched around. This makes it really funny to read aloud. They are like tounge twisters.Sometimes the way the words we mixed up make it hard to understand what the autor was trying to say. Young children will find this really hard.Children and adults who enjoy Shel Silverstein should read this books. It's not like his other works at all.

This book is all about woodland animals and the ways they move. A animal is on every pages and it tells a fact about the animal at the bottom. Some of the animals most kids will know lots about like bats, deer and owls. There are also some lesser known animals such as the woodcock and grouse.This book is a little long and young children might not be able to sit though it. The good thing is there is a action word on everypage. You can try to move like your favorite animal.

Chimp Math is a story of a baby chimp who was born at the zoo and his mother would not take care of him. Human doctors took over and the book shows photographs of the chimp named Jiggs as he grows. As the story unfolds it features pages showing clocks, calendars, time lines and other ways of keeping time records based on Jiggs growth and development.I liked the full color photographs of Jiggs. He&#65533;s funny. He does lots of things that real babies do like wear diapers, play with toys and crawls.I would recommed this to kids who enjoy stories about monkeys because this one is really neat.

Best of all, the story line is appropriate, with a message that is easily understood.

He has to start school soon and decides to take him to class with him. The cricket starts to make his noise and the teacher lets Jay share the cricket for show and tell.The book showed that even bugs can be good pets. It was a little long for a picture book and kids might have a hard time sitting still through the whole story.I would recommend this book for kids ages 6-10. Kids who enjoy country life will identify well with the main character, Jay

Jennifer Jones murdered her best friend and buried her alive. She was only 10 years old. She has done her time in a prison for 5 and a half years. Jennifer has been released and has to try and put her past behind her. Only Jennifer's probation officer Jill and reporter friend Rosie know the truth. The novel follows Jennifer as she tries to make a new life for herself. The book was very thought provoking. In today's society we never really know who is around us. They may be hiding a big secret, and who knows how they may react when the secret comes out. I would only recommend the book to mature readers. There are adults theme and violence in the book.

As a fan of Amelia's books for 20+ years, I was looking forward to reading this book to my eight-year-old son. I was disappointed in the book, though, and my son seemed to feel the same way. When we usually read Amelia books we both end up laughing at her silliness, but this book seemed to force the humor and ended up not being funny at all. My son did enjoy opening the flaps at first, but after the second one, everything just became too predictable. It was liking using the same joke over and over and over, and it got tiresome very quickly. I wish I could recommend this book to someone, but I can't. Go read the other Amelia books, but leave this one on the shelf.

This book starts out with a little girl who find a fossil. Then we are taken on a journey through her imagination of what the fossil is. She thinks that it belongs to a flying raptor. She imagines what it's day was like flying through the sky.

Tippintown is a fanciful journey into the most unsual town. We are introduced to the oddities of the town through a whimsical, rhyming tour guide. A child's giggle box could easily be turned over through the imaginative illustrations and the outrageousness of the tour's guide description of the town, its people and their wild day-to-day adventures in life.The poetry seems to be choppy at times and its use seems to be unnecessary. The child is too drawn into the pictures to really focus on the poetry.This book is recommended to any family who enjoys to laugh at the silliness of stories like Alice in Wonderland.

They remain connected through the miles, even as tragedy strikes the family back home.Young teens may be able to relate to some of the feelings that Sookan is feeling.

Then timber beetles eat away at the wood inside. The hole grows bigger and bigger. It starts to die inside because bacteria has set in. The tree then becomes home to many woodland animals.The book was very informative. I learned a lot about forests and ecology while reading this book.I would recommend it to all parents who wish to give their child an appreciation of nature, and to every teacher as a curriculum-enrichment aid.

When you think of manners, usually the last thing that you think about is pigs. You get a notion in your mind of a pig rolling around in the mud or digging its snout into the slop and making a mess. I think, though, that the choice of pigs to demonstrate good (and bad!) manners in this book was a perfect choice. Children, including mine, are naturally drawn to pigs, which I believe is the reason for the popularity of Charlotte's Web and Babe. Just seeing a picture of pig dressed up as a teacher on the front of the book was enough to take this book off the shelf and put into our library bag.My family and I really enjoyed that the author looked at both good and bad manners. The human mind often needs to see a positive and negative connotation to truly grasp an idea. It also gives the parent an opportunity to discuss why something is considered "good manners" and what can be improved in the situations where "bad manners" are exhibited. The author covers a good deal of the "manners" that parents try to instill in their children, but in a fun way for the whole family!To top things off, the illustrations in this book are wonderful! They tease the imagination to see animals playing human roles. Also, the emotions of the animals seemed to be expressed through the style and colors of the background and the writing on the pages. Then, of course, are the subtle things on each page that entice you to spend time carefully looking at each page. On every page there are small things that are sometimes overlooked at first, but quite enjoyable when found! The use of colored newspaper pieces in the background as everyday objects was ingenious and added so much appeal to the book. This book is a work of art that is useful in teaching manners!

This book is about the crazy adventures that Nick finds himself in after his move from Happy Valley to Hoboken, New Jersey. At first Nick does not like his move to a different city, but he soon finds himself having the time of his life after befriending two kids his age, Loretta and Bruno. This trio spent most their first days together laying around in the coolness of a basement reading "Classics Comics." They soon find themselves enthralled in excitement, though, when things began to mysteriously disappear. These disappearances soon lead them to begin an adventure to learn the story of a phantom and the truth behind a giant, 266-pound chicken owned by Arthur Bobowicz.I liked this book because it is a whimsical tale that allows the imagination to run wild. The reader is taken on a fast-paced ride through the pages of this book that takes them to places of unusual and impossible situations. It is written in style similar to the styling of Louis Sachar, author of Sideways Stories from Wayside School and other books, complete with weird adult and children characters who undergo unusual circumstances. The situations that the characters find themselves in make you laugh out loud because of their absurdity.Yes, I would definitely recommend this book to children of all ages. Even though I am a adult, I still enjoyed this book, as it breaks out from the "norm" of children's books. This book will allow a family or child (or adult!) to have a good, clean, fun time reading it.

This book is actually a famous poem by the prolific poet Alfred Noyes. This particular poem is about the love between an American soldier and his bride-to-be in the Revolutionary era of the 1770's. It is a graphic and sad tale of the sacrifices that people will make for true love. The central theme of the story is the British soldiers taking hostage the love of the "Highwayman." The soldiers use her as bait to draw him out so that he could be murdered. Instead of submitting herself to this mission, though, she gives up her life by shooting herself with a gun, just in time to warn her love of the danger that he was being drawn to. The rest of the story deals with the decision between protecting the life that his love sacrificed for and honoring the life of the lover that he has lost.The illustrations utilize dark colors, shadows, and details (and lack thereof) to bring the mood of the poem to life. The words themselves also do a great job of creating the atmosphere of a tragic love affair that is destined for an unhappy ending.While this book is a "picture" book, the themes of death, suicide, and murder prove too much for a younger audience. This poem is typically one that it is read by High School and College students, not by young readers. The poem is difficult to understand if just read casually, as it must be considered and pondered about in great detail. I would recommend it to readers who are mature enough to handle the themes of this

Here we learn about predators who use their teeth and claws such as bears and sharks. Chapter 2 teaches us about venomous creatures such as snakes and jellyfish. Chapter 3 is called small but deadly.

This is a basic concept picture book about the alphabet. Each page features a letter and a word that starts with that letter. In each illustration there is a cow. The illustrator Woody Jackson also does the drawings that are on the side of Ben and Jerry's ice cream containers.I read this book aloud to my 1 year old sister. She seemed to enjoy looking at all the cows in each picture. She tried to "read" the book along with me.I would recommend this book for parents to read aloud to the 1-4 croud. They will learn a lot about the alphabet in a fun way.

Two Little Train compares the life of a real train to that of a toy train. Each is pictured doing the same thing in it's own way.

Firebears are firemen bears that protect and serve in their area. The book shows what life in like at the station when the bears are waiting for a fire call. The first call they go on is to rescue a kitten from a tree. The next time they are called to fire at a business. After that fire is out they are called to another fire. This one is at someone home. The firefighters get the bears out safely and put out the fire. Then it's back to the station to await the next call!I like that the bear fire fighters in the book were shown doing more than just putting out fires. Lots of kids think that is all they do.Yes we would. Fire safety is very important. This simple picture book is a gentle way to introduce kids to fire fighters and the jobs that they do.

This is a great rain forest book. It tells us about various animals that live in the rain forest such as marmosets, lemurs, and capybaras. It also tells us that some of the rain forest is being destroyed and that is not good. Many life saving plants can be found in the rain forest. This book tells us that it's important to take a stand against the deforestation.This book is one of the We Both Read series where more detailed reading is on the left side of the page for the parent to read and the child's page on the right has only two or three words in larger type.I would recommend this book for children and parents to read together. The full color photos of the rain forest animals are great. There is a lot to learn in this short book.

A Packet Full of Seeds is set in the 1880's. A family is moving out west to start a new life. The mother is very unsure about the move. Before they leave the mother's friends give her a special gift, some seeds from each of their gardens. She gets really depressed when she sees how bare the land is around her. The children want to plant her a garden to cheer her up. They get seeds from a neighor and start to work. They are sad thay they don't have any flowers. Then their mother gives them the packets given to her before her journey. The plant them together and things start to look up for the whole family.The book is a little long for a picture book. Young children may have a hard time sitting still to listen to it.We recommed this book to go with a history unit on the westward movement. Teachers can share this book with the class and they can discuss may aspects of life in the 1800's

This book is an interesting twist on an old story. The basis of the story is how a big brother picks on and teases his little sibling (in this case a little brother), but is still loved and admired by the sibling. The interesting part of this story, though, is that the characters in the book are monsters! No need to be afraid, though, as the monsters are not scary, but actually cute! The little monsters enjoy the same things that human kids do, but of course, with a monster-like twist! The illustrations are very enjoyable, and it is fun to find the "strange" items in each drawing. Parents may be a little disturbed by the the bad manners of the bigger brother, but it can lead to a discussion of good manners!

This is a collection of princess stories. The stories are Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, the Little Mermaid, and The Frog Prince. Each story is told in rebus style. With a picture representing the word that is next to it. The length of each story is just right for bedtime!The illustrations are very creative. They are made up for handmade ornaments of felt. We also like that the book is made of study board pages. This makes it toddler friendly!Perfect for younger children who are interested in books but don't quite read yet - they see the pictures and can tell you what is coming next!

The Life and Time of the Ant is a cartoon type book all about ants. We learn lots of neat things about the ant family. We leaned how they communicate, about the parts of an ant's body, and all about the various kids of any in the world. One section of the book is about hoe important the ant is in the Rain Forest. We are told that ants eat insect pests, plant gardens in trees, removing decaying animals from the forest floor, and thin out plants that over crowd the forest.The pictures are drawn in a cartoon like style. They were neat to look at while reading.This would make a great read aloud for elementry classroom during a science unit on ants. Lots of great information is presented in a kid friendly way.

Amelia Earhart Free in the Skies is a comic book style biography. We learn lots of neat thing about Amelia in this book. We learn that she made roller caosters in her own back yard with her sister. We learn about the ways she learn to fly and about her famous flights. Through out the book there are also facts mentioned about the Wright Brother and Charles Linburg.I like that the book was written in a comic book style. Sometimes kids feel like biography are boing. This format spices things up a bit making them enjoy the reading. The illustation are also interesting to look at as they read.I would recommed this book to reader ages 8-11. The books tells just enough about the Amelia Earheart without overwhelming the reader with details. It would make a great book to read during a unit on flight.

This is a simple and delightful children's picture book that introduces today's children to an American legend. The book tells of childhood in Indian Territory, where he learned "to ride and rope as well as any boy or man" . It also tells of his love of books. This provides younger readers with lots of great information on a hero of long ago that they may have never even heard of. All in all it's a great little history lesson.This is a lovely story that will excite children's imagination, and the beautiful illustrations will charm young and old alike.We recommend this book for kids ages 4-8 who have an interest in cowboys.

Join his and he and his father work out his feelings in a unique way.I like the fact that the book showed the father character taking care of the baby. We need more books like that in today's world.

This would make a great story to read and discuss with young children about the way they feel about having a new baby in the home.

This is not what I thought it would be at all. But that turned out to be a good thing. I thought that this was a small book since amazon said it had 4 pages. And I though that it would be a soap on a rope. Instead it's a kit to make your would teddy bear soaps on a rope. It comes with instructions, 2 soaps, 2 molds. You melt the soap and pour in the molds to make your our teddy soap! Very cute for 5.00!!

This is, without a doubt, a very strange book. It has a dark and ominous feel to it as you read. It left me feeling very unpleasant and disturbed after finishing the book. The dark colored pictures are very depressing. The flow of the book is lethargic.This book is a chronicle of depressing tale of a man who has been given a gift of finding water through the use of diving rod, who then mysteriously loses the gift and becomes depressed. He gives up the things that he loves because he lost his gift. No one can seem to break him out of his depressed mood, even his granddaughter. It is kind of a heavy theme for a book that appears to be written for a younger age.The reader is drawn to the book because of the appearance of a pig on the cover. It would leave one to believe that the book would be mainly about the pig, but the pig is just a supporting character to the story.I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you want to be left feeling low and depressed. Our children were not very receptive at all.

After awhile he gets tired of her in his room and he wonders if she will ever get well and be able to return to her own home.The book introduced a lot of culture and vocabulary from the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

This is a simple introduction to quilting for kids. It starts out by telling a little history on quilt making. Then it goes on to tell about various quilt patterns. The book features a helpful page of pictures of items used in quilting such as quilting frames and rotary cutters. In the end of the book is a great idea we hope to use in our home school. A classroom quilt project is started by writing letter and mailing squares of fabric to children's book authors and illustrators. They are asked to decorate the square and mail it back to the student. The squares are made into a quilt.What did you like or not like about the book?I enjoyed sharing this book with my great grandmother. She is a sewer and we liked looking at all the patterns for the quilts.Would you recommend this book? Why or Why not?We would recommend this book. At this time there are no books in the kids section on quilting. This is a great introduction to quilting.

I Spy Shapes in Art is a great introduction for young children into the world of art. Each two-page spread contains, on the lefthand page, the words "I spy with my little eye and a certain shape to look for. The right hand page contains a large reproduction of a work of art by a variety of artist from around the world.This is a neat twist on the old game I Spy.

Everyone has a story that is made up of lots of things like when they were born, what race they are, who their parents are and lots more. This book is all about race. It teaches us that we are really all the same deep down. Everyone is a person that deserves to be treated with respect no matter what color their skin is.The book is full of colorful images. The book is not too long to read all at once and it has a great message.We would recommend this to teachers and anyone who works with children. The book is a great way to open discussions on racism, and treating others with respect and kindness regardless of who they are, where they live, the color of their skin, or what clothes they wear.

This is a book about Martin Luther King Jr. We learn that he stood for peace not violence. He wanted everyone to be treated equally no matter what color their skin was. Some people did not like the way Dr King went about things. They sent him mean letters and he even ended up in jail. Dr King never gave up or gave in to violence. He always stood strong in his beliefs.I learned a lot from this book. I knew a little about Martain Luther King Jr but this story taught he much more.This book would be helpful to elementary students when writing reports Martin Luther King Jr. There is a helpful time line with dates of important events listed in the back of the book. This is a great book to read during black history month.

Oh NO! There is a wild animal loose on the farm! The animals think it might be a coyote but they can't tell because it's covered in leaves! What ever it is they all try and run away from it. In the end the animal catches up with the gang and she's really only a playful rabbit looking for a friend!The books illustrations were neat. I read this to my 1 year old sister and they kept her attention well.I would recommend this book to be read aloud to preschoolers and younger. They will enjoy the surprise ending!

This is a biography for kids on Jackie Robinson. He was a famous African american baseball player. He had to work really hard and ignore rude comment from many fans. Most people in his days did not like black and whites playing together. He took the bad and pushed it aside and became a better person and player!The book was not too long and not too short. It contained the right amount of information for kids.I would recommend this book to kids who are learning about the Jackie Robinson. I learned a lot from reading this book.

They neighbor are mean to them and the Worm family decides to move somewhere where they will not be judged by others. They try several places but always run into others who don't like them because they are different. Finally they find a worm family just like them and all goes well from then on out!There are lots of themes that can be discussed with this book such as family, self esteem, and worms.We would recommend this book for families to read and discuss together. This is a great story to illustrate that just because some one is not just like you that doesn't mean that they don't have feelings that can get hurt.

Iris and Walter love school and they love their teacher. One day when they arrive they learn that their teacher is sick and they will be having a subistute teacher. The subsitue is Iris's grandfather. This is fun for Iris and her classmates. Iris gets to be the special helper for her grandpa. Then the next day things don't go so well. Iris's classmates get to do the special things that she did the day before. She no longer likes having to share her grandpa. She is glad the next day when her teacher is back and her grandpa is all hers again!I think that young kids can relate to Iris in this book. If their parents have helped out in the classroom they may have had a hard time "sharing" them with their classmates. This is a great book that can be used to discuss these feelings.We highly recommend this entire series. They are great for beginning readers. The chapters are short making the reader fell like they have really done well!

She feels like she is flying when she is swinging high in the swing and when her dady picks her up and spins her around and around!The pictures were fun to look at. The story moved at a fast pace as well.Yes. Little children need to know that their fathers love them very much. This book reinforces the concept well.

His mom and dad hug him and he starts to feel like a little boy again!The book was simple and easy to read. Anger is a problem for lots of children today.

The grandmother in the story begs the grandpa to leave the tree a little longer. He does and the story has a happy ending.This book can be valuable as a teaching tool.

This is the fifth book about Miss Malarkey and her class. This time they are off on a field trip to the science center. The class really show no respect for the teachers of the parent helpers. They do things like they bury one another in the fossil pit and get stuck in one of the displays. The kids think that he field trip was a great success but Miss Malarkey isn't so sure!The pictures are great, and the small details add to the humor. It is creative and funny for both children and adults.This would be a good book to read with a class before a field trip. The book can lead to many discussion on field trip behavior and respect for elders.

This is a photo essay of a puppy who born into a family of service dogs. He is raised and trained well but the story has a twist. As the time nears for Ira to go into more detailed service dog training the facility isn't ready to take him. Instead he goes to work for Guide Dogs for the Blind. All ends well for the dog and the new owner. A list is featured in the back of the book of many organizations that provide service and guide dogs for people. Also listed are selection for further reading.The story created good dialog and helps children learn about how dogs can help those with disabilities.I would recommend this book to all kids who want to learn more about guide dogs and how they are trained. This would make a great addition to the library as there are only 3 other books in the collection on guide dogs.

I thought that this book was great. We checked it out from the library and my six year old son has chosen the teddy bear party. He was not too thrilled with the bowls of porage cakes, but all the other ideas are great and really get the kids involved.MElissa

Dolphin Talk is a lively and very kid-friendly book with cheerful illustrations that kids will enjoy and learn from. The book teaches us that dolphins are a lot like humans. They communicate by clicking sounds and echolocation, instead of words like we do. The book is part of the Let's Read and Find out science series.This story is a great book for kids who are intersted in dolphins. The information is presented in a kid friendly way making it easy for young children to grasps the concept of echolocation.I recommend this book to parents and teachers of kids ages 5-9. This book would make a great read aloud during an ocean unit.

This is a wonderful book with questions about dogs listed on each page. After the statement it ask true or false. Then it goes on to tell you the answer. You will learn the answer to questions like Do dogs hear more than people do? Did ancient Egyptians breed dogs as well as cats? Do dogs see what we see?The book might have been more interesting to dog lovers if it included real photographs of real dogs instead of paintned ones. It was still a neat book with lots of cool facts on dogs.We would recommed this book to all dog lovers. This is a fun and educational way to learn more about your pet.

The book is about a boy who is really into his video game. He's almost beating level 20 when his mom calls for him to play outside. He's really upset. Once outside he finds that his frinds are outside as well. Their parents sent them out as well for some nice fall air. They notice that one tree has one leaf left. One boy says that he heard that the last leaf to fall from the tree is lucky. So the boys wait and wait for it to fall. Two of the boys finally give up and only one waits it out. When the leaf falls he takes it back inside and puts it on his head. Then it's back to the video game to see if it will bring him luck!The book is a good read for all ages. I liked the illustrations in the book.I would recommend this book to others. It's a good fall time theme book. It can lead to discussions on weather and leafs. It only has a few words per page making it easy to share with lots of age groups.

King Bidggood's in the bath tub and he won't get out. The page calls out for help. The first to try to get the king out of the tub is the knight. He tells the king that it's time for battle. The king responds that they will battle in the tub today and sets out playing with some tub toys with the knight. The fun continues when the queen gives it a try when its time for supper. The king just eats in the tub. The duke gives it a try next by telling the king he wants to fish. The king says today they will fish in the tub. It gets even more crazy when the entire court come to a fancy ball in the tub! The page has had it and decides to pull the plug!I liked the illustrations in the book. There is a lot to look for and they are really funny!This is great to teach that even the littlest of people can have the biggest of ideas

This a picture book biography of Sequoyah. I learned that he was the creator of the Cherokee alphabet. His friends teased him but he kept working anyway. He was a very smart man.The book has beautiful illustrations. I never knew about Sequoyah before reding this book. It was a nice introduction to his life.I would recommend this book to kids who are teased for one reason or another. Sequoyah followed his dreams when he was teased. He is a good role model for kids today.
