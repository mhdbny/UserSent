Do you have tons of unadorned journals that you have made? Have you ever wondered what to put in them? If so, this is the book for you. It is packed with fresh ideas for decorating all those blank journals.The book starts out teaching the basics of creating books. This includes making a spiral bound book, and rebinding a store-bought journal or vintage book. The instruction here tends to be a bit incomplete for a true beginner. If you want to make a journal from scratch, buying a true bookbinding book is highly recommended.There are great ideas on variety of journal styles including daily, travel, recipe, garden, artists' sketchbook and triptychs. Each one has a different and easy-to-create binding. The instructions are step-by-step and accompanied by photos.Where this book really excels is in turning your book into an artistic masterpiece. There are lots of creative project ideas and techniques that I have not seen used in this way before. Some include wax resist, image transfer, plaster paper, emulsion lifts, and creating carved stamps.The examples though the book and in the gallery are stunning. The resource and book list is very helpful. It's nice that it also includes a list with email address of all the artists in the book. If you want to turn you journal into a true work of art, this is the book to get.

This book really takes me back to my childhood. Seeing the prices, my only wish is that I had kept some of these pristine in the box rather than building, trading and ultimately losing track of them.The emphasis here is on figure, theme and specialty modles rather than the standard cars and military models. Covering the '50's-'70's; Sci-Fi, horror, movie, TV and hot rods are the popular subjects here.For each model there is a color photo of the box and sometimes a built model, manufacturer, date, scale and estimated value boxed or built. There is also a brief history of model manufacturing.There are nearly 1000 models here including my favorites, those wacky cars of George Barris and Ed Roth. This is a great guide for the serious collector or someone who just wants to reminisce about those hours of model building fun.

It also covers studio safety and finding workshop facilities.Techniques are next including working into a light or dark field and both hand and press transfer.These include step-by-step instructions accompanied by demonstration photos. Working in specific mediums including watercolor, acrylics, water-soluble writing instruments, monoprint paints (Createx), oil paints, water-based oils and alkyds follows. A section discussing special oil-based printing inks for lithography, etching, printing and serigraphy is also here. There is even a chapter on special techniques including using masks &amp; stencils, embossing and creating collages.The final chapter gives an overview of monoprints, which combine monotype with other print making processes, and mixed-media monotypes. This includes intaglio, drypoint and engraving, as well as linocut and collagraphic monoprints.There is a nice list of suppliers as well as interesting biographical notes on the artists featured in the back.

This is a great book that shows you how to draw many animals including elephants, bears, horses, cattle, deer, sheep, primates, cats, dogs, squirrels and rabbits.For each animal there is a complete sketch of the front, side and three-quarter view as well as close-up front and side head views. Next, sketches using basic shapes show the animals from several angles. Then, skeleton, musculature and surface anatomy are shown and discussed. A brief three-step demonstration of how to draw the animal follows.Complete drawings of the animals doing various activities such as drinking, touching, sitting, and resting are also shown along with sketches of the animals' young. Sometimes different species of animals are shown such as polar and black bears. Animals sharing a similar shape such as zebra, buffalo, hippopotamus and burro are shown sometimes as well. Drawings include brief commentary.Though I do like this book and did find it helpful, especially the anatomy/muscle diagrams, I wish the written instructions were a little more detailed. Overall, I would recommend it to any beginning to intermediate artist who wishes to improve their animal drawing technique.

In a style similar to that of Asian ink paintings Moti elegantly captures the beauty of nature in his artwork. Moti's wonderful paintings, prints, etchings &amp; drawings will draw you into the peaceful &amp; simple world he creates.In Moti's world ships glide across the ocean while the sun gently slips into the sea and flowers rest delicately in a vase. Trees stand silently against the blue gray sky or bend their branches to the blowing winds.Horses prance and tigers prowl ready to pounce their prey. Owls sit softly on branches or extend their wings &amp; slip into the night. Siamese cats stand stoically &amp; fish swim by. A child sits quietly for a portrait.The text is in both in English &amp; French. It includes biographical information &amp; extensive quotes from Moti himself. The introduction compares Moti's work with Turner's. There are also several photographs of Moti working.

Conveniently, small templates, which you can enlarge, are included for all the projects.Most of the projects use latex or acrylic paint, only a few use oils.

Some of the effects and projects have pictures of finished rooms or objects done with them.Almost all of the techniques here, and more, are also covered in Chronicle's companion book, Paint Recipes. What sets this book apart is that it is project oriented, focusing on the application of the recipes to the many decorative projects I've described. This is a great source of technical know how and artistic inspiration.

Some of Maxfield Parrish's least known but most vibrantly beautiful works are the landscapes featured in this book. Here is his ultimate mastery of light and color.Although commercial illustration built his fame and fortune, Parrish's true love was landscape painting. Many excerpts from his correspondence attest to this fact and provide a remarkable glimpse into the background of the artist.There are several pages of photos of Parrish's estate, &quot;The Oaks&quot;, which provided the inspiration for many of his works. Now owned by the author, it is evident how these magnificent grounds are reflected in the paintings.The book concludes with 34 full page color plates of landscape paintings produced for the Brown &amp; Bigelow Co. from 1936-1963. Having been a Parrish fan for years, I found several new favorites here.

They are grouped by family &amp; separated from the fish for easy reference.Conveniently, this book uses detailed text instead of symbols to describe the fish &amp; aquarium conditions. Some information includes habitat, behavior, feeding, breeding, physical characteristics, maintenance &amp; difficulty keeping.Both scientific &amp; common names are given &amp; the fish are grouped by family. Good general information on caring for the fish as well setting up &amp; maintaining the aquarium is also included.

Subject matter includes striking landscapes &amp; architecturals, historical scenes, native peoples, sensual women &amp; harem scenes. This book is appealing on different levels. As a coffee table book it is beautiful to browse. As a scholarly work it brings together and makes sense of many artists' work within a common cultural theme.

This coffee-table book is packed with beautiful colored pencil art covering a wide variety of subjects including people, nature, still life, and fantasy. Styles also vary from abstract and impressionistic to photo-realistic. It is a great source of inspiration and ideas.I like it that there is only one piece of artwork on a page and you get more information than just the size, surface, artist and title. Each artist writes about themselves and the artwork. I think these added remarks really help you understand appreciate the artwork better.Some of my favorites include an adorable bird on a fishing reel by Sylvia Westgard and a sunflower by Nancy Huges. I also loved another called Garden Party II by Priscilla Heussner featuring flowers floating in balloons. I enjoyed a portrait of ballet dancers by Thomas Thayer and an unusual fantasy tree with musical leaves by Mike Russell.In the back there is a glossary and a directory of artists in case you wish to contact them. The variety here shows off the wonderful range of possibilities in this medium. This makes a great gift for any colored pencil artist or enthusiast.

I love the d&eacute;cor in this the book. The rooms shown here tend to have clean and modern lines yet they are richly and elegantly decorated, rather than flowery, rustic or cluttered.The book is arranged by color and includes a chapter for each of the primary and secondary colors as well as chapters on pastel and neutral color schemes. Each section first gives background information on the color including its characteristics. It then shows 5-6 example rooms with swatches of the colors used. There are designers' comments on the colors as well which I really enjoyed reading.It was really nice to see rooms that use purple as their primary color. I personally love purple and it is such rarity to see it used well, without being overpowering. Though not a big fan of orange in past, seeing some of the rooms using it here has inspired me to take a second look at using it in my home. I found the chapter on setting mood with color to be very helpful.It's great that a directory of designers and photographers is included as well. If you love color and want to see it expertly used this is the book for you.

This wonderful book shows a wide variety of different beds. You see everything from an unusual lounge that supports you with gel-filled circles to an exotic canopy bed with hand-blown glass finials and hand-painted posts.There is large photo of each bed as well as information on the materials it was made from and its special features. The designer, manufacturer, and design date are given as well.Some of my favorites include a roll-up lounge bed shaped like a snail that would be great for lounging and an interesting looking wave shape chaise lounge. Some designs are amazingly innovative, like a bed that folds away and coverts into a desk and another that can be either a couch or a set of bunk beds. There is a cradle made of cardboard and crib/cot that can be expanded as a child grows as well.Ranging from whimsical to practical, what all of these designs have in common is creativity and ingenuity. They are great for anyone trying to get ideas for designing their own bed. I was amazed at what an imagination some of the designers have.

I have no idea what avocat is talking about. I am wondering if we even have the same video or the person never looked at it in full. I don't see how doing a sun salutation is advanced. While to 2nd DVD (intermediate) includes stuff like shoulder stands, headstands, and crow; it walks you through the process including something called chalk talk that shows you common errors and how to fix them. While these poses do take some amount of strength and balance, there are warm-ups and modifications show. I always recommend going to an in-person beginning yoga class before using any video, this is actually one I would "watch and study" BEFORE even going to a class. Why? Because I learned more from this video than I ever did in any, of the many classes (at least 30), I took including over 10 different instructor with a least a half dozen different styles such asKundalini, Bikram, Iyengar, Anusara, Jivamukti and Yin.In fact, I think watching this video should be a required by all yoga instructions on how to do poses right and help others correct theirs.Out of all these classes I took most paid very attention to helping the class do the poses correctly. Unfortuely, In most of the classes I've been to the instructor just shows the poses without even looking up to see if people are doing it right. I am amazed I didn't get hurt in some of them, even when the instruction did pay attention to these more complex and potentially dangerous (for an unskilled, unfit beginner with limited flexibility and balance) poses. I know I wasn't doing them right and I defiantly now see how I could over time develop injures from repetitive doing poses (including the basic variety of sun salutations) wrong. It's now also no mystery to me now how people get injured in yoga so easily even when their not pushing too hard especially if they have some kind or physical limitation.The 3rd DVD video is advanced in the selection of poses, and nothing I would encourage an beginner to do. You need lots of classes (and/or videos) and a good deal of strength and balance to do these. However, when you are ready, the instruction is excellent. However, I will say that I wish this series had more poses for the inflexible and not so strong beginner. I would thrilled to see them release another DVD (or set) with a bunch more of truly beginner poses. I can understand why they choose these however, because these are poses are often done incorrectly and that have the most chance for error and injury. All in all it's definitely worth the price for just the chalk talk. You can always buy the DVDs separately, and get just 1 and 2 or even just rent it from Netflix.

This is a delightful coffee table book featuring an impressive selection of earthenware, porcelain and stoneware. It includes a wonderfully diverse array of styles and techniques masterfully executed by contemporary craftsmen. With over 800 unique pieces, it will provide me with inspiration for years to come.I loved a shimmering vessel created by Robert Piepenburg and the teapots by Rimas VisGirda with women smoking. I also enjoyed a thrown jump pot with buffalo and abstract nude male/female teapots. I found a whimsical coil-built stoneware plate called indigo sky with a man hanging on to the moon truly delightful as well.The layout is straightforward. Each piece includes a large color photo and brief information on the techniques used to create it, the artist and the dimensions in both English and metric. The photography and overall quality of the book are excellent. There is also an index including the address of all the artists in the book that is helpful if you wish to purchase from one of them.

This book has a lot of good ideas on how to make your own book of shadows as well basic information you may want to include on things like crystals, element corresponds, charms, meditations, spells, rituals and divination. It is a good book of ideas to help you get started and I would buy it again. At the same time, I really feel the need to point out some of the books flaws that no one else mentioned.To start, I was very unhappy with her crafts section. She says she is not crafty, and that she writes this for beginners. However, any non-crafty person would become easily frustrated with many of her techniques. There are also no diagrams or pictures help with these. If you think you want to any of the crafts she mentions, borrow a book (or several) on those topics from the library.For example, her instructions for papermaking were bizarre. I have made paper and have many books on it. Yet, I have never heard of the method she describes. She says to make a papermaking screen with wire and nylons. She mentions that with her method, you can only make one piece of paper at a time and mush let it sit in the screen for a day or two to dry. She also states if you want more than one sheet, you will have to go through the tedious process of making more flimsy screens. You can buy inexpensive kits with screens and couching sheets - felt sheets that you put the paper between to dry so you can make more than one sheet at a time. Some papermaking books even tell you how you can make your own, much sturdier, papermaking screen.She also tries to teach candle making. The method describes does not give enough information and could actually get you injured. Yet, another craft she mentions is bookbinding. The instructions are too basic. Actual bookbinding books should be helpful in sparking ideas as well as give good instruction. While I have not tried it yet, the only craft that seemed reasonably described was making your own wax seal with soapstone.The author mentions using various scents on papers for your book. This is fine, but for some unknown reason she never though to warn you if you do this and you have several different scented sheets that do not blend well, your book will reek. If you want to do this, just do it on one sheet or choose compatible scents and realize scents on one page may transfer onto other pages in the book.I also found that her descriptions of various spells / rituals were sometimes too vague. I absolutely loved the idea of a portable scared space. I was very disappointed to discover that her description left me with unanswered questions and so I can't use it.

This is a wonderful book for experienced painters with that want to expand their horizons or for anyone who wants background information on clay-surface techniques. It shows how a wide range of painting and drawing techniques can be used in conjunction with scratchboard techniques to create a stunning array of results on these very versatile surfaces.The book starts out with background information on clay-coated surfaces including history, and the types of surfaces and their characteristics. It then covers application and scratching tools. A basic vocabulary and an overview of various mediums that can be used on them are also here.Several sections highlighting different surfaces and mediums follow. These include ink-coated clay surface, India ink on white clay, color medium on white clay and printmaking with the clay surface. Each section includes at least one demonstration of a work in progress from start to finish. The printmaking chapter is the largest and includes eight demos. These demonstrations are meant to showcase a general technique rather than create an identical copy of the work.My favorite part of the book is the beautiful artwork throughout. I may even buy a second copy to cut out and frame some of this vast array of gorgeous art. Captions for each piece include artist, title, size and a basic description of techniques used. My favorite is &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, a whimsical piece that combines acrylic airbrush with scratching techniques. I also loved the many black and white wildlife images.There is a great material resource directory and a helpful index in the back. I admit I have not really tried any of the techniques shown here. I think they are a bit above me as a beginning artist. I would definitely buy the book again though just for the example images and the inspiration they provide to encourage me to develop my own skills.

This book establishes J. C. Leyendecker as one of the great &amp; important, but now often overlooked, illustrators of the early 20th century. He was one of the most popular magazine &amp; advertising artists of his time.Leyendecker's subjects are people, all with strong character &amp; expression, painted in exquisite detail. There are ancient warriors, magnificent football players &amp; businessmen in fine suits portrayed as modern heroes of the 1920's.The authors do an excellent job of profiling this very private man, explaining the development of his style and career. His working technique using many preliminary studies leading to a perfect finished painting is shown.There are 16 full-page single sided plates showcasing a wide variety of Leyendeckers's finest work. They are printed in beautiful color on heavy stock and would look great framed. I really enjoyed learning about this great artist.

There are two additional sections on metal fittings and upholstery. Molding a backplate, antiquing new metal fittings and replacing a double stuffed seat are just a few of the techniques taught here.The next section focuses on repairing and beautifying surfaces. This includes a great guide to solving common problems like white water marks, dents and scorch marks. Veneer repairs such fixing blisters and removing an old veneer and reusing it as are also covered. It then goes on to demonstrate several surface effects including French polishing, working with gesso, gilding, aging paint, staining, graining, marbling and waxing.The last section includes 12 projects that use the techniques previously covered. In one project, clients need a sixth chair. They find one with a matching back but must replace the entire seating structure and reupholster it. In another project an empire-style night table needs its brass fitting replaced and its tambour door dismantled and refitted. It also needs new stain, French polish and wax.The information here will enable you to take on some tough challenges with satisfying professional results as you restore or enhance fine furniture. To help with any project there is a nice list of suppliers in the back.

This is a great book that shows you a wide variety of color schemes and how they are used in various decorating styles. There are large color photos of sample rooms with comments from over 80 professional designers.The book starts out with rooms that use red, blue, yellow, green, violet or orange as their primary color. Pastel color schemes follow. Here I love the southwest style living room. Rooms using analogous, complementary and neutral color scheme are next. An elaborate tent style canopy bed was my favorite here. Then you are shown how to create mood with color. A variety of rooms are shown that convey different feelings such as nurturing, intellectuality, playfulness, healing and romance.Many of the rooms shown feature two or three color triangle swatches that highlight the basic colors that were used in its design. Also, in the back, there is a section on altering color to create families of colors that will work together. There are swatches for each of the primary and secondary colors and each one is shown with white, black and its complementary color gradually added. A list of designers with contact information is included as well.The practical advice on color combinations and using color to create mood were very useful for me. Plus, I got lots of decorating tips and ideas just by flipping through the pages of room designs. This book is definitely worthwhile for anyone who takes pride in decorating their home.

I have almost every henna and mehndi book published. Though it is not the best book out there, the fact that is comes with a pre-made ready-to-use paste in a tube as well as powder you can mix for yourself is a really nice feature.The book included gives a nice history of henna including it use in weddings and medicine as well as its use for hair, perfume and decoration. Instructions are included for both the pre-made tubes &amp; powders that must have ingredients added. Though one is included, there are step-by-step instructions accompanied by b/w illustrations for making your own cone. It liked it that recipes from different areas like Pakistan and northern Africa are included. There are also 8 exercises for learning to draw the designs. The best thing about this book, is that it shows more designs that are on body parts other than hands and feet than other books.If you really want get serious about doing mehndi and want it to be darker and last longer you need to get fresher paste and probably won't want to use any in a pre-made tube. However, this is wonderful for those just getting started or if you just want to experiment without a lot fuss.

This large beautiful book chronicles the growth and development of the U.S. Air Force as an organization, from the beginnings of flight to the present. It is much more than an air combat book.The story begins before there was an Army Air Corps, with a history of flight from the pre-Wright Bros. era. The progress in aircraft, the men who built &amp; flew them &amp; the role of air power in military strategy are extensively covered.The highlights of this book are the hundreds of wonderful color photos from the U.S. Air Force museum. Close-ups of aircraft, engines, cockpits and aviation art take great advantage of this unique resource.Combat is not ignored however, as the Air Force's role in every major conflict is detailed with many action photos. This is a comprehensive and complete history of the highest quality.

I love David and Marc Muench's photography and this book is a treasured addition to my library. The color and production values are exquisite and up to the high standards I expect from Muench.These photos capture the awesome beauty and fantastic variety in California's natural landscape through the seasons. The book is divided into sections for the mountains, forests &amp; plains, coast and desert.Muench has brought new life to many often photographed landmarks with his mastery of light and detail. He has also uncovered many beautiful but less known places; dawn &amp; dusk skies, vibrant flowers, delicate waterfalls &amp; more.James Lawrence's accompanying text touching on a wide range of topics relating to California's natural history is fascinating and entertaining. I have loved spending hours with this magnificent book.

Though I have numerous books about decorative finishes, this is the only one that focuses on metal effects. It is packed with fresh ideas and techniques not seen elsewhere.

Each project includes a materials list, and step-by-step instructions accompanied by photos. A discussion of the project and large photo of the finished design is included as well.Technical information is included in the back. There is a photograph of just about every tool and material you will use. The author also guides you seamlessly through preparing size and gesso. The details of water-gilding, gilding with oil and acrylic size, finishes, metal patination, and painted metallic effects are also shown. There is also an awesome section spanning nine pages that shows swatches of over 70 special effects including painted patinas, metal-leaf patinas, and patterned metallics.If you love the look of metal then you need to buy this book.

This is a wonderful reference book for the watercolor painter. It contains all kinds of useful information to help you understand the medium and improve your knowledge and skills.The first 40 pages provide a great history of watercolor painting, so often overlooked in the overall scheme of art history. Then all the aspects of setting up a work area and studio are covered followed by a very thorough materials and tools section. There are example pictures and descriptions of everything from easels to paper and brushes to paint. There is also a paper stretching demo and a watercolor color chart.A section on the principles of drawing follows. This includes instructions on making simple shapes, creating perspective, Plato's rule, golden sections, drawing a quick sketch and more. Then various watercolor techniques such as creating washes, erasing with a dry brush and achieving texture with salt and turpentine are covered. Next, there are two chapters on color theory and mixing explaining warm, cool and broken colors as well as color schemes and values. A nice demo of painting a watercolor with three colors is included.The last chapters deal with techniques, skills and actually beginning the painting process. Here you find information and advice on painting the human figure, skies, clouds, trees, landscapes, illustrations and seascapes. There are no real projects here and no reference photos. Rather the focus is on general advice for painting various subjects with example demonstrations. A helpful glossary is included in the back. This is certainly one of the most thorough, useful and entertaining books I have seen for the beginning watercolorist.

This is the fascinating story of the author's expedition to study Mountain Gorillas in 1959-60. Told as a detailed narrative, it is as much an adventure story as a scientific analysis.From the riveting first encounter with a family of gorillas through the identification of several distinct groups, their daily routine is revealed. The gentleness that Schaller found dispelled many long held myths about Gorilla behavior.Beyond the gorillas, this is also the complete story of a region, its people and other flora and fauna. The issues of preservation of these animals and their habitat are much the same as those faced today.This is the documentation of an important pioneering work that paved the way for Fossey and other researchers who would follow. Illustrated with photos and maps, it is a compelling read from cover to cover.

I've used a number of books trying to get started in origami and found most of them lacking or disappointing in some way. This one is the exception. The projects are basic, yet fun. They are great for kids or anyone who has struggled with origami in the past like myself. You won't be pulling out your hair trying to figure out what you are supposed to do next.I was thrilled to discover folding guides for most of the projects. This is something I have not seen in any other book. You can photocopy them and practice before wasting good paper. If only every origami book would include this! Conveniently, some colored origami paper to get you started in also included. I really like the spiral bound binding as well allowing the book to lay flat as you practice.The book starts out by helping you select paper and learn the basic folds such as the mountain, squash and rabbit's ear with clear step-by-step photo instructions to get you off to a good start. Then many bases are covered including the kite, diamond, fish, waterbomb, preliminary, frog, bird, and windmill.The projects follow with some of my favorites being the star box, iris, butterfly and flapping bird. There is a beautiful gallery in the back showing examples of more advanced origami projects. This is the perfect book for anyone wanting to get started in origami.

Patricia Wyatt's paintings of Native American Medicine Women are delightful. They seem to come alive off the page.These women are powerful yet sensitive, showing a deep understanding of the world and their place in it. They are an inspiration to all women who are teacher, healer, nurturer and artist.Susan Freilicher's verses capture the essence of each painting. Drawing on the wisdom of many cultures they demonstrate the qualities of the medicine woman in all women.These paintings project great warmth with vibrant colors. There are wonderful costumes and many animals, birds and fish are included in the paintings. Printed one to a page, they would look great framed.

Although some exotic ingredients are used, most of the recipes are quick &amp; easy to make. Recipes have between 3-6 grams of fat, though most contain 4-5 grams. This may seem a little high, but the muffins are a bit larger than most. Baking papers are filled to top, producing nice round muffins. Recipes include a wide variety of muffins including those with fruit, savory ones, &amp; coffee cake style. Scones, waffles, hotcakes, breakfast breads, syrups &amp; spreads are also included. The book also discusses equipment &amp; ingredients. Many useful hints &amp; tips are included as well. One of my favorite recipes is the Parmesan &amp; fresh herb muffins.

This book presents a great introduction to many different dyeing techniques using either fiber-reactive or acid dyes. The numerous galleries throughout the book will help inspire you.The book starts out with a great explanation of the types of dyes, paints and pigments available. It then covers techniques and tools including good safety advice and fabric preparation. Tips for over-dyeing, stitching and direct application are here too.Next, thickened dyes, gutta and watercolor techniques are used to create painterly effects. Tied-resists follow including finger-pleated silk and nouveau shibori. Then batik, block- printing and marbling are taught. The instructions are excellent with detailed step-by-step processes accompanied by photos. However, be aware the projects here teach techniques. There are no templates or the like so it would be nearly impossible to create an item identical to the ones in the book.The best part of the book is the chapter on color theory and dye mixology. It thoroughly explains the cryptic instructions that come with dyes and how to create your own recipe card.The galleries are awesome. There is one for each section and each includes at least eight different artists displaying their work with the basic techniques used. A directory of all the artists including phone numbers is included in the appendix along with lists of supplies, schools that have degree textile programs and a glossary of terms.

This is a must have book for anyone who loves gorillas. It chronicles the heartwarming story of a baby gorilla &amp; his family as they travel to their new home showing how they adapt to their new environment.The book starts off with the tale of Cenzoo, the baby gorilla, who was abandoned &amp; near dead. It details his and his families (him &amp; mother, another female, &amp; a silverback male) airplane adventure to their new home in a Denver zoo. The story continues to follow the lives of the gorilla family as they acclimate to their new home. There are many observations about how a gorilla's behavior differs in captivity versus in the wild. I really like how each gorilla's personality traits were described. I truly felt as if I got to know each of the gorillas. Lots of time is also given the plight of the vanishing gorillas &amp; what is being done to help.

This is the best book on color I have found. It is a must have for anyone who has ever been confused about matching colors and creating the right mood. Though I was already fairly confident working with color, this book helped me a great deal by letting me see a wide variety of color combinations together.The book begins by discussing the color wheel. This includes the facets of color such as hot, cold, light, dark, pale, bright, warm and cool as well as a great explanation of all the different color schemes. It is divided into over 20 different themes including romantic, friendly, earthy, fresh, calm, traditional, professional, magical, classic, tropical and energetic. For each of these themes a set of color schemes including monochromatic, primary, complementary, split-complementary, analogous, spilt, clash and neutral is shown. A brief tips section for using the themes in graphic design, interiors and fine art is also provided. In the back of the book there is a process color conversion chart that gives the CMYK values for each of the 106 colors used. Swatches that you can cut out are included. This is very useful for graphic designers.A very helpful and versatile CD is included with this book as well. It allows you sort by color scheme or theme. You can also pick a color and then see all the color schemes that will work with it. Each color scheme is shown in several different forms and against black, white and gray. One of a color scheme's colors can be made bigger to be used as a background to the others as well. Colors can be saved and added to custom lists and exported to popular graphics programs like Photoshop and PageMaker. The color DIC number as well as RGB and CMYK values are also given.The program does have some minor limitations. It can only search one aspect at a time. For instance you can't search for a rich theme with yellow. Also, if you search by color or color scheme you can't find out which theme set it originally belonged too. I found it a little hard to install and use at first as well.This book and Color Harmony Workbook are pretty much identical in content. However, this one is smaller and contains a CD while the other has tear-out swatches. Because I was more interested in decorating my home the workbook was more useful to me. For a web or graphic designer using computers a lot this version will probably be of more help. If I had to select only one color book, this one or Color Harmony Workbook would be my first choice.

This is a most impressive book on the African Elephant, with page after page of fabulous photos of these mighty beasts. It would make a great coffee table book just for the pictures but it is much more than that.The main focus is on preservation of the species in the face of shrinking habitats and the poaching for ivory that continues today. The efforts of 16 African wildlife preserves and parks are fully described here.Each region is profiled with information on its elephants and several photos of the elephants specific to that area. The mature huge tuskers of Kruger National Park are truly awesome.There is also plenty of information on elephant history, physiology and social interaction. This is a beautiful and significant book on the life and challenges facing the African Elephant.

This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants get more pizzazz out of Illustrator. From just starting out, to obtaining advanced effects, it guides you step-by-step with both text and color examples. Though this book does a nice job of covering the basics, where it really excels is in its coverage of advanced techniques. I learned to create painterly effects with gradient lighting and how to make a complex pattern. It also showed me how to create a truly realistic reflection, &amp; produce shadows. The tips and techniques really helped me to learn to use Illustrator more productively. The resource and artist directories were a nice plus as well. The CD included is also quite spectacular. It includes some awesome brushes, Wow! actions and clip art. It also contains images to pick apart and trial programs. There are even some great tutorials on the basics of Illustrator.

This is an excellent reference book on over 90 different Japanese crafts from all areas. For each craft there is a history as well as the basics of how it is made. It is an encyclopedia rather than an instruction book.Some types of crafts covered include ceramics, textiles, lacquer ware, bamboo craft, paper, woodcraft, metalwork, dolls, fans, lanterns, candles &amp; items of calligraphy.The photographs are numerous &amp; all are in color. I loved looking at the textiles &amp; kimonos. I also enjoyed the Kyoto ware, kutani ware, bamboo containers &amp; decorative ink stones.I found the extensive list of books to be invaluable in finding out how to make the crafts mentioned here.

This is a wonderful bookbinding book. The projects here range in skill level from beginning to advanced. Step-by-step instructions accompanied by color illustrations guide you seamlessly through techniques &amp; projects.I like how the techniques, such as folding types, pamphlet sewing, multisection sewing, attaching covers &amp; making containers to place the books in are taught before going on to the projects.My favorite book is actually four books assembled with Japanese style stitches &amp; encased in a wraparound box. It is really nice that it shows you how to rebind your favorite books as well. I have not seen this covered in other books.I love two-page gallery sections that follow each book type. They are very inspiring. The supplier's list &amp; bibliography are nice bonuses. With lots of fresh ideas, this book makes a great gift for yourself or a friend.

This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in paper sculpture. Each project is followed by a wonderful gallery of similar work by the demonstrating artist. These make the book worthwhile for anyone who appreciates the medium even if they don't do the work themselves.The book starts out with a brief introduction to paper sculpture and overview of paper sculpture techniques. Nine projects, each directed by a different artist, follow. Though the instructions are arranged step-by-step with photos, there are some advanced techniques involved and some experience and talent would be needed to create some of the more elaborate projects. There are also no templates, so making a project that looks exactly like the one in the book it almost impossible.I didn't try all the projects, but did enjoy making the sun. It is fairly simple and looks so great using marbled papers. I would have liked to try the goldfish and the swan shown on the cover, but I felt they were a bit to time-consuming and complex for me. Other projects, like the Liberty Bell and too cute chicken wreath, just didn't perk my interest.All in all, I'm glad I bought the book. The artwork examples are great and have inspired me to try some things on my own such as butterflies, fish and landscapes. I like that they list all the artists with contact information, awards they've earned and clients they've served. A list of schools that offer professional instruction is also a nice bonus.

This is a great book for those just getting started in digital photography. It gives an overview of effects you can create using programs like Photoshop and Painter. The book is packed with interesting large color photo examples.First you get an overview of the pros and cons of both digital and classical photography. Then there is information on choosing camera equipment, film, a computer, a scanner and a printer as well as software and other accessories. The author then gives an explanation of resolution and gives advice on making scanning more efficient and accurate.Many techniques follow. Some of the basics include using contrast, curves and levels, hue and saturation, toning, channel mixing, sun printing effects, posterisation, changing colors, and hand coloring. Others focus on filters or brush techniques such as blur/sharpen, pixelation, distortion, grain, paint textures and cloning techniques. Compositing as well as using layers, modes and multiple images is also covered. The author also offers in insight on color symphony, file types, compression, resolution and printing digital photos.This is not your typical step-by-step how-to book. You see concepts illustrated in photos, not page after page of computer screens. There is plenty of high lever technical advice here though, but the main goal to explain the logic behind the tools used. If you understand how they work and when to use them you can utilize them more effectively. This is the kind of background I have been looking for that is missing from most of the software manuals. In the back of the book there is an excellent glossary and a nice list of other helpful books and some websites.

This is a great kit and a wonderful gift for any rubber stamper. It comes with black inkpad glued to the box top, 18 stamps, and a nice booklet that tells a little about Celtic people, their history, &amp; the designs themselves.

This is an essential book for polar bear and nature photography lovers alike. There are over 250 photos of polar bears, and arctic wildlife captured in the beautiful frozen world they live in.I found the photography truly captivating. The adorable bears are shown splashing in the water, dancing, taking afternoon naps &amp; wandering through the snow. There is even one of the mother making friends with a sled dog.I was deeply touched by the many images of the cubs snuggling close to their mother. I found the other wildlife photos featuring many foxes and birds equally impressive. The captions for all the images are in the back of the book.Along with the pictures, there is a wonderful story of a year in the life of a mother polar bear &amp; her 2 cubs. The author switches pleasingly between factual accounts of the arctic world, folklore, &amp; the personal story of the bear family.

This is a good book for a young adult who has a strong interest in pandas and their endangerment. It would also be a great addition to any home school library. It is packed with fascinating facts about pandas &amp; how they live. The book starts out with a profile of the panda bear. This encompasses ancestry, classification, diet, socialization, mating and how they care for their young. Next, a history of how pandas were discovered is covered. The rest of the book is dedicated to the plight of the vanishing pandas including poaching &amp; their threatened habitat. A discussion of captivity &amp; breeding programs, as well as current action plans to save them is also detailed. A glossary &amp; suggested readings are a nice bonus. My only wish was for better pictures. All are small and are in black &amp; white.

This is a wonderful book filled with over 15 projects including folded paper (origami), assembled paper (paper sculpture) and art created with paper pulp. Beautiful and inspirational galleries after each project show you more advanced artwork using similar techniques and opening your eyes to endless possibilities.Each project includes a materials list and is demonstrated step by step with photos and sometimes illustrations. Helpful tips for each are also included. Though the instructions are good, there are no templates and some artistic talent or experience is necessary for many of the projects. My favorite projects include a washi doll, twisted paper box, and a pulp painting.In the back there is a nice list of suppliers and websites as well as a few organizations and educational programs. There is also a directory of artists with contact information. If you want a sampling of the paper art or just need inspiration this is the book to get.

This is a gorgeous coffee table book. I am mostly a rubber stamper and paper artist, and though I don't do much photography per se, I still love this book. It features a lot of collage art and ideas I know I can incorporate into my own designs.The book is broken into four sections including transformed, constructed, extended and digital images. Each section features the work of 4 or 5 different artists. Each artist was interviewed, explaining their techniques and thoughts on their artwork. Four different full-page examples of each artist's work follows, with captions giving information on title, size and techniques used. There is also a gallery featuring examples of seven other artists' work.Because I like to work with computer graphics I especially enjoyed the digital section. The still life with people in a soap bubble by Olivia Parker is really awesome. I love John Reuter's tile effect Polaroid transfers with nudes of as well. The winged pig of Maggie Taylor is another favorite.A handy glossary and index are included as well as a directory of artists with addresses. With such a variety of techniques and approaches to art this book is truly inspirational.

I own a few different mosaic books and I like this one the best. I found the designs presented to be more sophisticated than in other books. I was also glad that this book gives you a list of the exact materials used, instead of just expecting you to use found materials. Truly inspirational artwork and examples in full-color are featured throughout the book.The book starts out with a great history lesson on mosaics that spans about 25 pages. Next, materials, tools, and design are covered. I was impressed that this included photos of each tool. The basic techniques you will use to make the projects including cutting and laying mosaics both directly and indirectly. Finishing methods such as grouting, sealing and framing are also discussed.Sixteen projects follow. Each includes basic step-by-step instructions with photos. A large photo of the finished piece is also included. My favorite project was the straight back art nouveau chair. I also loved the brightly colored three-dimensional lizard wall hanging, a tabletop with grape and wine design, a Byzantine style tree of knowledge panel and a beautiful Aztec pot.I really appreciated the lists of suppliers and places such as museums and theaters, arranged by style, to go for ideas. I have had a hard time finding materials in the past. My only wish is that it provided templates for some of the designs. This is the best how-to book I have found for someone that actually wants to make quality mosaics.

This is the best book on color I have found. It is a must have for anyone who has ever been confused about matching colors and creating the right mood. Though I was already fairly confident working with color, this book helped me a great deal by letting me see a wide variety of color combinations together. It has been an invaluable reference tool in helping me decorate my home.The book begins by discussing the color wheel. This includes the facets of color such as hot, cold, light, dark, pale, bright, warm and cool as well as a great explanation of all the different color schemes. It is divided into over 20 different themes including romantic, friendly, earthy, fresh, calm, traditional, professional, magical, classic, tropical and energetic. For each of these themes a set of color schemes including monochromatic, primary, complementary, split-complementary, analogous, spilt, clash and neutral is shown. Tear out swatches, clearly labeled with theme and color scheme on the back, duplicate what is shown in the book. A brief tips section for using the themes in graphic design, interiors and fine art is also given.In the back of the book is a process color conversion chart that gives the CMYK values for each of the 106 colors used. Swatches are included for this as well. This is very useful for graphic designers.This book and Color Harmony 2 are pretty much identical in content. However, this one is bigger and contains swatches, while the other contains a great CD with a pallet picker. The one with the CD may be more helpful to web designers and such, but this version is probably better for interior designers and artists using traditional media. If I had to select only one color book, this one or Color Harmony 2 would be my first choice.

This is a wonderful book packed with easy-to-create paper projects for every room in your house. With so much to choose from you can never get bored.

I highly recommend this extraordinary coffee table book to anyone who loves flowers. It is packed with 60 exquisite images printed in subtly toned black &amp; white on quality matte finish paper. The large images show every intricate detail.Baril's images are in a classical style, using special effects including solarization and toning that only bring out the natural beauty of the subject. The remarkable detail and unique composition make each image special.I enjoyed the wide variety of flora including an exotic passion vine, elegant calla lilies &amp; a magnificent sunflower. More of my favorites are gladiolas &amp; brugmansia, as well as hosta ready to burst into bloom.This book is a masterpiece of elegant simplicity. The photos are printed one to a page on one side only. The only detail given is the name of the flower. The images speak for themselves and you can get lost in them for hours.

This book is absolutely fabulous, filled with bondage, erotica and torture of all kinds. Sorayama's ability to capture the erotic essence of a female is astonishing. His attention to detail and creativity left me in awe.The all new artwork is bold, containing very explicit images. Most of the images are on one page. The pictures are often quite bizarre. Some themes include piercing, cowgirls, urination, and women in metal or with medical implements.Sadomasochism is very prevalent and most women are shown submissive. Many are in very extreme bondage. However, some women are in leather and hold whips or weapons, playing a more dominant role.My favorite image is a woman with zebra stripes shown in two positions. Other favorites include a woman hung inches from a circle of barbed wire, a bleeding mermaid, a harem girl and an angel with a devil tail.

If you want an inexpensive but very informative guide to trees, get this book. The emphasis is on choosing the most suitable tree for a specific environment, with a special section on urban trees.The best part is an encyclopedia of 100 trees, with nice color photos of most. Information includes scientific &amp; common name, hardiness, characteristics, ideal growing conditions, native habitat &amp; varieties.Additional general information covers transplanting &amp; caring for the trees. There are also very useful tables on trees best suited to different geographical regions and environmentally tolerant trees.If you are looking for trees for spring bloom, fall color, or specific size, following the recommendations here will help you select the trees that will thrive in and enhance their setting in your garden.

I got this book out of the library. I have written 500+ reviews. I VERY RARELY give a score below 3 or feel the need to trash a book. However, after looking at the mostly positive reviews (I have my doubts these reviews actually even looked at the book), I couldn't help myself. The book has almost no instruction on iris folding. Only one project, the circle was numbered. All the rest of the templates were unnumbered in the back and needed (IMHO) to be enlarged. There were lots of pictures, but none of the iris folding ones were helpful and the rest were mostly about adding stuff like feathered angel wings or making grass to the cards. I had wanted to make the heart card featured on the cover. Beyond a tiny sample image and the unnumbered template there were no instructions. The heart and a Halloween card were both had offset irises. She noted to fill the bottom first, then "When you get to the appropriate point, start to add strips of your third paper ---- Only when you are nearly finished is the fourth added." Oh, how helpful! (sarcastic remark) For the same card the author spend more time on how to use a craft punch to add decoration to the card and sticking on a pumpkin than she did explaining the actual folding. If this isn't enough to keep you from buying it, note that the price is almost as much as 460 iris folded cards to make : the complete iris folding compendium which includes numbered templates for every project, yet this book includes only 6 projects. The only use I could see is for people who are already well versed on iris folding and are looking to add extra elements to cards that are both cutesy and boring. Note that as more of a pamphlet than a book, it is also WAY overpriced. Pretty much any iris folding "book" would be better than this.

This is a wonderful book for those who need delicious meals in less time. With over 300 recipes, it provides a wide selection of easy-to-follow family-style meals that can be partially prepared ahead of time.Information on equipment, procedures, &amp; ingredients as well as great tips on lowering fat are included in the beginning. Over 50 mixes follow, each listing the recipes it can be used in. Color photos show some of the finished dishes.Recipes include appetizers, soups, salads, vegetables, side dishes, main dishes, breads, breakfasts, cakes, pies, &amp; desserts. Some of my favorites are the lasagna, stroganoff, minestrone soup &amp; white chili.My kids &amp; I love the many slice and bake cookies, especially the peanut butter one. They are just like the pre-package kind in the stores but are a lot cheaper. The soft pretzels, corn dogs, &amp; cinnamon rolls are also great treats.

I can't say enough good things about this delightful book. I love it. It is brimming with a wide variety of beautiful designs. From delicate roses to Christmas holly and alpine motifs to charming little mirrors, this book has something for everyone.The book is made up mostly of projects. The instructions are excellent, including step-by-step directions accompanied by large clear illustrations. Full-size templates for design transfer are included for all the designs in the book. There is also a small section in the back that gives details on color, materials and techniques.I especially liked the Arabian nights theme with wonderful images of people and architecture to be painted on plates, candlesticks and tea cups. Fanciful gourds with insects painted inside hors d'oeuvres dishes are another favorite. I also loved projects featuring an array of feathers and a large selection of seashells.Before I bought this book I didn't realize it used paints that required a special porcelain firing oven. I have only used the newer ones that work in a regular oven. However, I am certainly not sorry I bought it. The wonderful motifs can easily be painted on anything using the appropriate medium in similar colors. I know these lovely designs will make it into the many other crafts I do.

For the person who though the workout was not intense enough do a search for "Stamina Gyrotonic Transformer 1000 home gym exercise equipment" (no quotes) on Google and the 1st or 2nd link should lead you to a place to buy an extra spring pack for about $100. However, you should note that despite the advertising, this machine will not and was not made too bulk you up like that. It is somewhat like pilates in that its made to compact muscle rather than bulk it. Gyro can be compared to pilates as as it is an example of how you can gain muscle without having to feel like your going to die when you workout. Both feel much more gentle than they are, but still just as effective if not more so than traditional weight lifting - remember Madonna uses (in part) this and look at her. Like other froms of exercise, you need to give a try for 1 - 2 months (about 30 workouts) to apperciate the changes. Even though the springs will cost you extra, the price overall is still a good deal. Someplaces sell the unit for $350 without shipping to begin with. Namaste

This fabulous volume is surely the most comprehensive collection of Gil Elvgren's work ever assembled in book form. It should go far to establish Elvgren, along with Petty and Vargas, as a master of the American pin-up.The biographical information is complete and well written including Elvgren's personal, commercial and artistic endeavors. The information on his associations with other pin-up artists of the time is especially interesting.The importance of Elvgren's models is emphasized, although he painted from photos rather than the live model. In many cases the model's photo and finished painting are side by side showing Elvgren's ability to capture form and expression.The book includes about 200 of Elvgren's paintings in vibrant full color and covers his advertising work for Coca-Cola and others as well as his famous calendar pin-ups. It is a great source for the pin-up fan, or art historian.

The native people in traditional dress are fascinating as well.My favorite of the entire city of Beijing lit with fireworks is nothing short of spectacular. The text and detailed captions provide a thorough background for the photos. This is a book you can get lost in for hours.

This book takes me back to the time I spent in Mexico a few years ago. It features a variety of decorative home accessory projects for people with different skills from sewing to woodworking. I love the vibrant colors and variety of designs offered here. The book is in full-color and there are step-by-step instructions, accompanied by photos, for each of the 20 projects. Conveniently there are templates and a resource list in back.Some of my favorite projects include brightly colored circular woven table mats, a copper wire fruit basket, a decorative hot chocolate whisk, cactus pots, a tin wall border, beautiful cut paper candles, an Aztec floor runner and a mosaic heart and spiral pattern table top.Three projects requiring basic sewing skills and a sewing machine are a cross-stitch table cloth (cross-stitches are painted), appliqued bath towels and drawn-thread curtain. Two others including pillowcases decorated with roses and a butterfly blanket require basic embroidery skill. If you wish to make a lime waxed shelf or a beautiful suede covered stool you will also need basic woodworking skills and power tools such as a jigsaw and an electric drill.These projects require a little time and effort but none of them are too difficult and the instructions are great. They will make some spectacular and unique accent pieces for your home.

It is amazing how simple many of the techniques are and the stunning results that can be achieved with them.There are tons of fresh ideas here for fabric, paper and other materials. Each technique has a color example of the product and a materials list. While the instructions are brief, usually taking only a few lines, they are for the most part easy to follow. Basic instructions for sewing and knitting as well as stencils and patterns are also included in the back.Some techniques taught include carving paper, crayon batik, ice marbling, smocking paper, faux stained glass, inlaid felt designs, branding fabric, photo emulsion transfer and sand painting, knitting wire and icing with plaster. Mini galleries showing experiments in things like paste paper, tea dyeing and fabric stippling in additional to numerous other variations and combinations throughout the book are there to help guide and inspire you.Though this is not a rubber stamp book, per se, I highly recommend it for rubber stamp, paper and fabric artists alike. The techniques taught here make great accents and backgrounds, adding spice to any project.

This is a wonderful book for learning to paint china using new paints that don't require kiln firing. The projects are both beautiful &amp; simple to make. I also found the full-color photos to be very inspirational.About half the book is dedicated to helping you learn design &amp; decorating basics, including using china in every room of your home. Different styles such as Classical, Victorian, Mediterranean &amp; English are described.Fifteen projects with step-by-step explanations and photos follow. My favorites were an oriental bowl, spice jars &amp; a country quilt vase. There is also great basic information on materials &amp; techniques.I was surprised how easy, but impressive the verdigris &amp; marbling finishes were to recreate. The supply list is also a nice bonus. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about ceramic painting.

This would make a good gift for any artist or anyone who enjoys writing down their thoughts. The inspirational quotes in the journal are also excellent for calligraphers &amp; rubber stampers. It makes a great companion to the Artist's Way book as well. The kit comes enclosed in a box and includes a journal, 10 incense sticks &amp; 3 stacks of paper disks. It is all done in Asian style graphics and colors.The disks include reminders to take time to enjoy the little things in life with quotes like &quot;Watch airplanes land&quot; or &quot;Take a garden tour.&quot; Quotes such as &quot;Decorate your mailbox&quot; or &quot;Make a painting on an old window&quot; inspire you to create things. Others, such as &quot;Borrow a friends coat for a day&quot; or Wear a disguise to the grocery store&quot; were a little strange and even funny.The journal has wonderful quotes and though provoking questions on each page. It encourages you to write down your thoughts about them in the journal to help be more creative &amp; gain inner spirituality. Questions such as &quot;Do you allow joy for the sake of joy?&quot; or &quot;What tiny change can you make for the better today?&quot; help you focus on what's really important in life. Quotes like &quot;A mind too active is no mind at all&quot; and &quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge&quot; really force you to think about how you live your life. Though I received this as gift and did enjoy it, I do think it was a bit overpriced for the content.

This is a wonderful book on cooking with flowers. The over 200 recipes included are both delicious &amp; nutritious. Most are also quick &amp; easy to make. The book starts out with tips on selecting &amp; gathering the flowers. Then a good French dressing that doesn't cover up the flavor of the flowers is given. Instructions for how to candy all types of flowers is given next. Recipes are arranged by flower. The number of recipes for each varies greatly. I love how the author took the time to include a brief history of each flower as well as information on its flavor &amp; general preparation. Some of my favorite recipes are the carnation crepes, day-lily tempura, &amp; dynasty eggs on toast made with chrysanthemums.

This is a wonderful book that shows you how to use color to create comfortable living spaces. It is packed with great color pictures with brief captions plus a more detailed text for each chapter and sprinkled with insightful comments from experienced designers.The book starts out discussing color and how it affects our well-being. It also explains color theory and then shows rooms including triad, complementary, monochromatic and analogous color schemes. An entire chapter is then devoted to neutrals. I liked one room with a wood floor and black furniture that was accented with a variety of brightly colored bowls and vases.Each of the primary and secondary colors is explored in it's own chapter. Here we have rooms in which the design centers around one major color and can see varied moods and styles that can be created with that color. My favorite was a little girl's bedroom with violet walls and a fantasy castle mural. I also like one with yellow chairs and Asian character throw pillows.The book wraps up by showing you what colors designers use most for living rooms, dining rooms, family rooms, kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms. This can be very important if you want to redecorate your home, but may need to resell it and some point. In the back there is a bibliography and an index of both designers and photographers with contact information.

This is a MUST HAVE book for erotic or bondage artcollectors. Sorayama's work is simply amazing. His imagination andattention to detail are incredible.There are many very explicitimages. Many pictures contain wild and creative bondage; others have unusual piercings displayed in unique ways. A lot of the piercings are in very intimate places. A few women hold whips.Some of the other subjects include mermaids, women with snakes &amp; other creatures, women in water, ponygirls and women urinating. Though some pictures contain metal work, there is less in this book than previous ones.My only wish for this book is that the pictures were all contained to one page. In my opinion, much of the artwork was somewhat distorted by being spread across two pages.

This is wonderful book for an intermediate to advanced quilter who wants to create impressive landscape quilts that are true works of art.First the basic method is demonstrated in detail including many illustrations. The main technique used to make the quilts is string piecing. Six beautiful projects follow. Patterns for each are found in the back.The book places a lot of emphasis on embellishment. Textured yarns, metallic threads, and fusible web as well as organzas &amp; tuttle overlays help to decorate the quilts. Fabric painting and pieced applique are also used.As both a paper crafter and a quilter I also found this book a great inspiration for making collages. The tips on color &amp; selecting a scene were very helpful. The large gallery in the middle is worth the price of the book alone.

While not the largest reference on Rolls-Royce &amp; Bentley, this book is one of the most pleasurable I've read on the subject. It is very well presented, concise, informative and readable.Beginning with the first Royce cars of 1904, the book continues chronologically through the 1996 models. I most enjoyed the sections on the Silver Ghost &amp; those on the later models which are given equal coverage with the popular middle year cars.The numerous illustrations are very well selected. Especially nice are chassis line drawings for most models and many good interior photos. The color photo gallery in the center is beautiful.Another useful feature is a technical specification chart, including chassis numbers, for each series. If you would like to invest in just one book to tell the story of Rolls-Royce &amp; Bentley, this would be an excellent choice.

This is a wonderful book for anyone looking to revamp old, tired-looking furniture. It is packed with many useful and inspirational ideas. A complete list of materials and equipment, as well as instructions for preparing the surfaces are given at the start of each project. Step-by-step directions are then given for each of these techniques or projects. Most of the projects use latex or acrylic paint, only a few use oils.The book starts out with advice on preparing surfaces including an informative chart as well as basic instructions on filling holes, replacing hinges, removing nails, securing laminate and mending a wobbly chair. It then discusses tools and materials, including the use of power tools, working with metal, joining and application of chrome trim or faux leading. There is even a great chart on varnish and wax mediums giving details such as heat resistance, water resistance, durability and sheen.Over 15 projects follow. Many are done in two or three different styles. Each has a photo of the finished project. There are also a few two-page galleries focusing of thing like masking, using seashells or decorating with tartan plaids to help give you ideas. Some of the projects include wardrobe doors with country curtains, drawers with stenciled vases, a metal trunk with verdigris finish, and zebra print dining chair. Tabletops are done in many styles including mosaic, faux lapis lazuli, decoupage, and with stamped large dots. There is also a no sew cover for an old sofa, a shaker fabric hanging, nautical banner and fabric canopy for a four-poster bed. Conveniently, templates of any designs are included in the back.Techniques are also taught. Some of these include wood washing, high-gloss lacquer, aged paint, crackling, dragging, colorwashing, spattering, stenciling, decoupage, pattering with a paint roller, fabric painting, rush dyeing, punched tin, frosted glass and metal effects such as copper or pewter. Close-up photos show the techniques in a few different colors and recipes are given for each one. Experience has shown me that printing accurate colors is tricky and there are so many variables in materials and surfaces that results can vary greatly. I would recommend experimenting on a small scale and tweaking the recipes to get the colors you want.Some of the techniques here are also covered in Chronicle's companion books, Paint Recipes or Decorative Paint Recipes. What sets this book apart is that it is focuses more on furniture.

I purchase another massager that looked like this one (had no brand name on it). It burned and had to rewire literally more than a dozen times I loved it so much. I guess that's what happens when you use it for hours at a time. I loved it and though this would be a good replacement. No so, it is terrible, VERY weak (maybe 1/4 power out) with no difference between settings. I am still looking for a replacement, my netherworld is aching for a better option.

I love animals and I love art so there couldn't be a more perfect combination for me than this book. Many of the finest contemporary wildlife artists have contributed to this collection. Creatures from all areas including water, seashore, mountain, rainforest, field, forest, plain, lake, marsh and swamp are here.Information on each piece includes the artist, title, medium and size as well as a brief note about it from the artist, giving the book a personal touch. My only wish is that some of the stunning artwork was a bit larger. Most are only about a half a page.My favorite area is the rainforest. It includes a mama gorilla and baby, an adorable tree frog, a gorgeous macaw and a lizard chasing a butterfly. Favorites from other areas include a hooded warbler bird with rhododendrons, a selection of woodpeckers, rhinos under a baobab tree and a solitary cougar in the snow.I like this book so much I plan to buy another copy so I can frame some of the pictures and put them on my walls.

The 3 color shapers that come with the book are of top quality.I really enjoy the feel of the color shapers and the ease with which I learned to control them. They can be used to apply paint or manipulate or remove paint from a surface, creating endless possibilities.The book starts with basic strokes then on to a wide variety of projects using different techniques &amp; readily available materials, including metal, wood, ceramics &amp; paper. There are some great effects by combining colors and glazes in layers.The projects have clear instructions with color photos every step of the way. They are a springboard for more ideas.

Themes including baseball, dogs &amp; dolls are highlighted.I especially enjoyed the original documents reproduced here including early ads with items selling for pennies, design patents, beautiful hand painted salesman sample pages and complete selection of back-stamp marks.There is a well illustrated section on the dangerous reproductions now entering the market and many more tips to aid the new or experienced collector. This is a truly indispensable reference on Nippon.

A basic list of essential oils and absolutes along with a description of their aroma, blending options and any warnings is also included.The rest of the book is dedicated to making soap and bath products.

There are sections on whipped cream and glycerin soap as well as soap balls, liquid soaps and other bath items such as shampoo and body powder. Some of my favorite recipes include mint and lavender slice, red sky crescent moon soap, liquid lime soap, milk bath and fantasy body dust.There is a great list of suppliers in the back including websites. An index was helpful in finding things as well. Overall, I found this book to be helpful in creating decorative soap and bath items for friends, family and myself.

This is a great idea book for anyone interested in home d&eacute;cor or interior design. It also makes a great &quot;coffee table&quot; art book for anyone who appreciates fine decorative painting. It features a variety of surfaces created by eighteen different artists.The book is divided into three sections: faux and fantasy, painted surfaces, and murals and Trompe l'oeil. Each artist has a gallery showing numerous photos of their work as well as a brief biography and description of their techniques. Captions contain information on how each individual example was created.I loved a whimsical little girl's room painted from floor to ceiling with pastels by John Parsons. All the furniture by Fischer is just awesome. My favorite was an iridescent pastel chair with a woman's face on it. I enjoyed the bathroom where Entner achieves an awesome texture by using visible brushstrokes and a goldfish pond floorcloth by Dale Wade. I was also very impressed with the Drywall columns painted to look like Italian marble and a garden like octagonal room with lattice work up the walls.Although most of us may not be able to emulate the artistic skill displayed in this book, it is still a great source of ideas and inspiration for anyone interested in incorporating decorative painting into their d&eacute;cor. There is contact information included for all of the artists and photographers represented. I know I will use ideas from this in my own home.

This book showcases the superb talent of the author in designing and crafting her unique style of quilt. The techniques will challenge the experienced quilter, but the many finished pieces will be a joy for all. These quilts are based on actual landscape photos from which the basic design is drawn. Geometric patterns are added &quot;fracturing&quot; the image into sections, each of which is pieced with it's own selection of fabrics. The end result is a remarkable play of light &amp; color that gives the impression of looking at a scene through multiple lenses or broken glass. The special techniques used to produce these quilts are well described and illustrated. This is more than a how-to book. The many beautiful quilts done by the author and her students and shown in full color are a great display of the art of the quilt.

This book deals with the development of steam powered ocean going ships during the Nineteenth Century. It is a scholarly work that draws upon extensive original research to tell this fascinating story.The ships studied here are paddle wheel steamers that still relied on sails as a secondary power source. The authors do a wonderful job of combining technical detail with anecdotal accounts of times aboard these ships.The main focus is on the seaworthiness of the ships, as the new propulsion systems created new problems in handling. In depth examinations of engines, paddle wheels and sail rigging are supported by many technical drawings.There are also many great photos &amp; drawings of the ships at sea and crews in action. This book will appeal to both the student of maritime technology as well as the lover of seafaring lore.

The wonderfully explicit, easy to follow and well illustrated directions make creating the projects a breeze with designs for all levels.The book starts with a list of both basic and &quot;wish list&quot; supplies. It then helps you choose the right brushes and gives some great tips on caring for them. Then there is advice on choosing paint, keeping it fresh and how to tell when it is dry. There is a large section on mixing color and color schemes as well.The essentials of brush loading, basic brushstrokes and blending are next. The author guides you through each step with detailed illustrations including the best section on creating basic brushstrokes I have ever seen. I found the learning from your mistakes section invaluable in helping me refine my technique. Practical advice and great tips here abound here. Surface preparation is also discussed here giving details on preparing wood, tinware, paper and glass.A wide variety of projects follow including brushstroke designs, leaves, ribbons, water drops, fruit, vegetables, flowers, lettering, faux finishes and Trompe l'oeil.

The instructions are excellent; they are both written and illustrated step-by-step. There is also a large full-color picture of each finished project. In many cases there are also several versions of a project, such as beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of making an apple. I also love that the projects show swatches of each color used and that brand names are not listed for the colors. This makes choosing matching color easier and it saves money because you don't have to buy a certain brand of paint to do the project. Some of my favorite projects include a daisy tray, forget-me-not candle holder, pear saltbox and mushroom sign.There are helpful template patterns for all the projects as well as a list of suppliers. Whether you're starting out or have experience with decorative painting this is the book for you.

This is a wonderful book for all ages. It is packed with creative and inspirational artwork, useful tips, and great techniques for making the sandcastle of your dreams. I really like that the book is spiral bond and the pages are laminated. This makes it easy to take it to the beach with you, without destroying the book in the process.The book starts out describing various construction methods, some accompanied by small photos. Then there are instructions for using and caring for your building tools. Conveniently, there is also a recipe for making a permanent waterproof castle. I think this is worth the price of the book alone if you're interested in making everlasting sand art sculptures and it is also great for those who don't have access to a beach. Instructions for creating over 25 different sandcastles follow. These encompass a wide variety of animals, architecture and transportation vehicles. They vary in difficulty from an easier two-hour long grass hut to the magnificent and possibly all-day long project such as the medieval style castle with dragon show on the cover. Some of my favorite projects include a cornucopia, an Inca house and a rocket ship.Though a complete materials list and clear written instructions are included, in most cases there are no step-by-step building illustrations. However, almost all include a nice photo of the fished piece. At such a reasonable price, it makes a great inexpensive gift for any beach lover or older child.

This is a wonderful idea book for home decorating. It is a guide to a variety of surfaces and finishes including paint, plaster, concrete, wallpaper, tile, wood, glass and metal.The book is divided into sections on various materials and finish types such as types of wood, paint types, paint effects, and glass styles.

A chart listing all the finishes in the chapter and their applications concludes each section.Each section includes one or two full projects as well as many other ideas. The projects are rated by difficulty, but they are very brief and do not include step-by-step demonstrations. Some projects include colorwashing a wall, tinting and polishing plaster, using fabric as a wall cover, making a tile border, creating tongue and groove paneling and building a copper paneled cupboard.In the back there is a nice section on putting it all together.

This is a fascinating story of rare and beautiful animals and the crew of research photographers who became intimately associated with them. It offers some startling revelations into the life and behavior of bears. The Spirit Bear, or Kermode Bear, is a white genetic variety of black bear, found only on Princess Royal Island off British Columbia. The region is also home to black bears and grizzly bears which are included in the book as well. What is most remarkable here is how the bears on the island, which had very little prior human contact, accepted the crew with an open gentleness allowing many close encounters to be documented. The book is written in an engaging first person style and beautifully photographed with close ups of bears in various activities. It will surely be a favorite addition to the library of any nature lover.

This is an excellent book for the intermediate polymer clay artist. The projects are fun and sophisticated. I have nearly ten different polymer clay books, but this is the only one I have found that shows you how to make full-size floral forms.The book starts out with an excellent introduction to the basics of selecting materials and explains how to choose among the different brands of clay. Conditioning the clay, color mixing and making basic shapes is covered next. A wide variety of techniques and projects follow.Some techniques include millefiori with instructions for making and using lace, checkerboard, pinwheel, chevron, plaid, spliced, radiating, kaleidoscope, shaded and face canes. The rose cane is gorgeous. Onlay techniques, working with glitter, metal leaf treatments and making beads are next. I love the author's ideas for quilted and Balinese filigree beads. She then goes on to explain carving clay and creating Bakelite like forms.Next comes the process of making and using molds including taking you step-by-step through making an Asian man face pin. Then, imitative techniques simulating precious stone like jade, marble, ivory, agate and red jasper are covered. There is a great recipe for turquoise. Translucent effects for creating opals and metal effects for creating mokume gane and patinas are a great help. There is even a technique to get a marbled paper look.Vessel construction follows. Projects included a woven vessel, unlined pot, mosaic bowl and curved box. The book ends with a few sculpture lessons including making a harvest candlestick with several vegetable forms. A great seahorse sculpture and a creating a realistic doll's head are also here.Though the instructions are fine for someone with a little polymer clay experience, they are in some cases simply not detailed enough for a total beginner. However, with so many beautiful projects and ideas, this book will provide inspiration for years.

This is a wonderful book for anyone with an interest in golf course design and construction or in the history of the game itself.

Many never before published photographs are highlights of the book.You will see great views of the classic courses with scenes under construction and during play, and such unusual hazards as furrowed bunkers and chocolate drop mounds. Many original designers' drawings are also included.A series of original paintings adds color and life to some of the legendary holes. This is fascinating reading that will immerse you in the history of the great golf courses that are as viable today as when they were created.

This is an excellent book for anyone just starting to learn pen &amp; ink drawing. This is not a step-by-step, draw what I draw, book. It is more a collection of tips &amp; techniques for drawing almost any subject.The author starts out by explaining each kind of line and what it's used for. Next, she explains value. Ink washes, a dry brush, and a variety of different line types are then used to create contrast and texture.The design &amp; composition section is great for showing you how to put everything together and what pitfalls to look out for. She also guides you through choosing a subject, finding a good photo to work from and achieving perspective.Finally, each kind of subject is explained in detail. Some include flowers, landscapes, all kinds of water, and buildings. She also covers many animals including dogs, horses &amp; birds. Human faces &amp; figures are detailed as well.

This is an excellent book for those who are seeking both a delicious &amp; nutritious breakfast. Since trying these recipes, I feel better &amp; have more energy throughout the day. Most meals are easy to make, but some require exotic ingredients.The author starts out by discussing proper nutrition &amp; some of the ingredients used. The recipes follow including cereals, eggs, breads, pancakes, toppings, soups &amp; drinks. Elegant &amp; kid pleasing meals are also included.There are even special chapters focusing on heart healthy &amp; lean hi-energy meals, as well recipes for those with allergies. Some of my favorites include Rhode Island jonnnycakes &amp; orange spice popcorn waffles.My kids love the breakfast cake &amp; milkshakes. My only complaint is some of the recipes are not low-fat. Quite a few have over 7 grams of fat, &amp; others contain up to 19 grams of fat per serving.

This is a good book for beginning students learning to write Kanji and Hiragana. The large format makes it easy to see how to form the character correctly.The instructions are excellent, showing you step-by-step, how to write each symbol in detail. Though cursive script is shown, it is smaller and detailed instructions for writing it are not given.Each character's reading and meaning are shown as well. However, since less than 75 words are covered, it is not intended to teach you to read Japanese.The book also covers materials, techniques, &amp; a brief history of Asian calligraphy. There is a beautiful calligraphy appreciation section in the back. It shows some of the characters reflecting their meaning.

This book is intended as a memorial to the artist, Susan Seddon Boulet, who died in 1997. The author selected Boulet's powerful paintings of bears as symbolic of her life and spirit.There are 43 paintings and drawings of bears representing a fine cross-section of Boulet's work. These are integrated with a complete biography, career history and analysis of the individual paintings.Boulet's bears are nurturing, protective, healing and powerful, never violent. They reflect the bear's place in the Shamanic and native cultures upon which her art is based. The paintings are beautiful and emotional.I have long admired and enjoyed Boulet's art and this is my favorite book on her work. I love the paintings and the messages of peace and hope they convey.

Drawing on more than 20 years of first hand research and collecting, as well as historical and contemporary data, this is a most comprehensive catalog of the fishes found in the waters surrounding the Galapagos Islands. Filling a void in the study of the Galapagos, this volume demonstrates that the marine life is as varied, unusual, &amp; unique as the land animals which have been so well documented. 437 fish are included with 41 being unique to the region. For each species there is a general description, natural history, habitat, range and size. There is a b/w drawing or photo of most species plus 150 excellent color photos, most showing a live fish in its habitat.

The d&eacute;cor in this book is awesome and inspiring. There were very few room designs I didn't like. The rooms all have strong personality with a simple modern look. There are no flowery or country looks here.The book is split into two sections. The first focuses on what colors are associated with in our lives. Objects are shown and their effects on emotions are discussed. It also explains and demonstrates the excellent and very useful 60-30-10 color rule.The second section focuses on color functions for serenity, fantasy, healing, clarity, nurturing and spirituality. Here more full rooms are shown. I love the tips for formality, informality, local color schemes and stages of life. I also like the use of flower bouquet accents (fresh or silk) in lots of the rooms. They really add spice to the d&eacute;cor.The color choice quiz in back of the book is great. It really helps you pick the best colors for any room in your home based on what personality you want it to have. If you want to truly use color to create the perfect atmosphere in any room get this book.

This is a wonderful book for those seeking inspiration on creating an open, airy home that lets the outdoors in. If you love windows then this is definitely the book for you.The designs of over forty different architects and designers are shown here. Each tells a bit about the featured home and their design approach. There are several large color photos of various views in each home, with captions giving the details. The styles are predominantly modern and clean looking, but in a wide variety of styles and decor. There are no cute country ducks or rooms overstuffed with flower prints.I loved the rooms with Asian accents. There is a wall of botanical prints in one home that is simply gorgeous - I'm sure I will do something similar in the future. The use of flower arrangements is fantastic. It amazes me how something as simple as a bouquet of sunflowers or vase of roses can really make these rooms into something special.This book has been a great help to me. I know I will use some of these elements and ideas when I get to build my dream home.

I have bought lots of Kanji books and this is one of my favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to learn to read the Kanji characters. The visual and written mnemonics really helped me remember the characters.The book is broken down by subjects; some include the world, food, body, people and animals. For each word the Kanji character, reference #, English meaning and visual/text mnemonic are show.On and Kun readings, as well as the schematic of elements are also included. There is a Kanji index in the back.My only wishes were that it had the romaji translation and contained information on how to write the characters.

These include transforming a home after dark with dramatic lighting effects, creating a moon lighting effect and my favorite section on lighting pools and fountains with some really fabulous designs.

There is contact information for these designers and photographers along with some lighting manufacturers in the back of the book. This is a design book, not a technical manual. Each caption tells the type of fixtures used but there is no information on wiring or installation.A very useful chapter on common lighting mistakes along with frequently asked questions and a glossary conclude the book. Although most of the examples in this book are of homes well beyond average means, many of the ideas and principles presented can be adapted to enhance almost any dwelling. I found it quite inspirational and enjoyable.

There are even several excellent charts on preparing almost any surface for painting.Numerous techniques for painting walls including colorwashing, sponging, dragging, rag rolling, stippling, limewashing, dry brushing, fade-away washing, loose-glaze, mock and rubbed back plaster are included. Effects such as Fresco, Mediterranean and Egyptian are also covered as well as creating borders, stone blocking and making distressed plaster patterns.Then wood effects such as aging, spattering, graining, crackling, combing, and staining are covered. The Scandinavian and Shaker color pallets and styles are demonstrated here too. Stone finishes such as marbling, lapis lazuli, sandstone, porphyry, granite and terracotta follow. Then there are metal finishes including patina, verdigris, rust, lead, iron and bronzing. Finally, lacquer, tortoiseshell, shagreen, leather, stenciling, and gilding techniques are shown.Most of the projects use latex or acrylic paint, only a few use oils. Step-by-step directions are given for each of these techniques or effects. Close-up photos show the each style in a few different colors and recipes are given for each one. Some styles have pictures of finished rooms or objects done with them.Since printing accurate colors is tricky and there are so many variables in materials and surfaces, I know that results can vary. I would recommend experimenting on a small scale and tweaking the recipe to get things the color you want. All in all this is fabulous and inspirational book at an excellent price for anyone who wants to do more than brush on off-the-shelf paint.

I was very impressed by the artistry and sophistication of the designs in this book. They are definitely elegant, not cutesy or country, yet easy to make using simple tools and materials.There are 13 complete projects including collage, printed, fold-out and photo holder cards. Each of these will lend itself to many more varieties depending on the paper and embellishments used. There are excellent step-by-step instructions accompanied by full-color photos making assembly a breeze. Some, like the potato print card, would be great projects to do with a child. Additional sections include making your own envelopes and paper, and eight pages of paper samples.If you are looking for beautiful cards that are simple to create and that will impress your friends and family, this is the book to get. It is also a great addition to any rubber stamper's library because the structures in these projects adapt easily to decorative stamping.

As a beginning quilter, I found this book to be an excellent guide for easily making kaleidoscope quilts without mirrors or extensive measuring and cutting. As a paper crafter as well, I found the technique great for collages.The book starts out by explaining how to choose fabric and pick colors. It's a great plus that almost any fabric that has a repeat pattern can be used. Then, there are lots of great tips on rotary cutting, machine piecing &amp; pressing.Next, the stack-n-whack process is demonstrated in detail with step-by-step instructions and full-color photos. Fourteen different quilt projects, in 7 different styles follow. Illustrations are used instead of photos for these.The quilts themselves are beautiful. There are large color photos of each one. In the back there are guides and patterns for all the projects as well as lesson plans for classes.

This is a beautiful coffee table book for colored pencil artists and enthusiasts. Subjects span a wide range from people to landscapes to animals and still life works. There is something here to suit almost anyone's taste. This wonderful variety truly shows off the possibilities of the medium.Some of my favorites include Donna Basile's close-up baby face, Carol Tomasik's &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, and an American Indian on horse titled &quot;Me-A-Pa-Te&quot; by Stan Pawelczyk. I also enjoyed Elizabeth Holster's &quot;Isle Royale Portage&quot;; this landscape could easily be mistaken for a photograph it is so vivid. I would have to say my absolute favorite is by &quot;Wing Nuts&quot; by Mike Russell. It's hard to describe, but it's very unique. It shows sunflowers and bees in a fantasy scene.I really like that instead of just listing the basics about each piece, like title, size and paper used, they also include commentary from the artist who created it. This gives you insight into what the artist was thinking and adds a personal touch to the book. A Directory of artists, as well as a glossary, is also included in the back. This makes a great gift for any colored pencil artist.

This is a wonderful book for an intermediate to advanced bookbinder looking to spice up their book creations and make them into masterpieces. It is worth every penny just for the inspirational examples and galleries. They are great for when you created that gorgeous book and don't know quite what to fill it with.The book starts out with the basics of materials and supplies. A very through demonstration of three different ways to make neat corners follows. Next come several unique and interesting projects all created by different artists. Its hard to choose my favorite projects, they are all so awesome. However, I really loved French travelogue made of wood with a hinged cover. The house, a book in a box, is really creative as well.Though this book is great for inspiration, I really feel it is best for someone who has bookbinding experience. Yes, the book does have step-by-step instructions accompanied by demonstrating photos. However, it does no show or describe in detail any of the sewn bindings which could hinder a beginner. For example, it says coptic stitch was used, but did not tell you how to sew the coptic stitch. Also about half the projects are simply altered forms of a base project that was described in more detail. The variations have only a brief paragraph that is just a description, mostly without any real instruction.Unfortunately, there is no list of suppliers. However, I like that contact information for all the contributing artists is listed in the back. This makes a great source of inspiration for any serious bookbinder.

This is a wonderful book for anyone wanting to hand-tint photographs without buying a bunch of expensive supplies. Most projects use easy to find and relatively inexpensive colored pencils (like Berol prisamacolor) instead of fancy photo oil and specialty markers. A special effects gallery in the back shows photo that were colored with markers, watercolors, acrylics and mixed media.The book starts out with a brief explanation of materials, film types, print surfaces, shooting pictures and presenting your finished piece. An introductory how-to hand-tint a photograph is included as well.The people chapter follows. Here you learn to create realism and give your photo a romantic feel. Coloring both vintage and contemporary photos is covered. Next, the place section covers nature, flowers, architecture and an animal landscape. The final section focuses on advanced techniques and uses more specialty products. You learn techniques for toning, staining, dyeing, and using oil paints. Each of the projects is demonstrated step-by-step. A materials list and color swatches of the pencils used is also included.I admit the author could have been a bit more detailed about materials and the oil mixture. However, this is a great book overall with very nice, easy-to-follow examples and I believe it is suitable for all levels.

Even gardens where the trees can be seen are listed. I really appreciated this type of information. It is so rarely seen in most reference book.The appendices are extremely helpful they list botanical gardens &amp; nurseries. A source for each species can easily be found. Trees are also listed by characteristics. Some include zone, light requirements, soil conditions, resistance, color of bloom &amp; fragrance.

I own several collage books and this is definitely on my must have list. It is packed with full-color photos of inspirational &amp; imaginative collage art from a variety of talented artists.The book is divided into sections focusing on paper, fabric &amp; found object collage. Collagraphy, in which the collage itself serves as a plate for transferring the texture to a print that can be further embellished is also included.Each section features two projects that are both described &amp; demonstrated step-by-step with color photos. I especially like one made entirely of paste papers. I was able to create a stunning abstract artwork with ease.Resource &amp; school lists along with an artist directory are nice bonuses. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking excellent instruction &amp; fresh ideas to create their own collage artwork.

Learn to use classic stripes to create an elegant look or a bright simple floral print to create a lively retreat.The book starts out focusing on contemporary and classic fabric patterns. I love the decorating tips scattered through the book like using tiny prints and in a small room and larger ones in a big room or garden. It then discusses combining patterns. Again there are lots of great tips here like using several floral prints to create a rich looking collage or using patterns that include the same colors.The next section on quick-change fabrics is great. It shows you how easy it to change a room by adding, subtracting or changing the fabrics in it.

Bold and exciting looks predominate in this book, which presents tons of great decorating tips. The styles are mainly contemporary, eclectic, classical and traditional. There are not many country, frilly or floral rooms.The book starts showing you dramatic rooms. I loved a bedroom with purple walls, a huge white ball lantern light and a simple bed. I liked a soft yet high-tech looking living room done in several shades of blue and accents of orange as well. Many more examples show how to use contrasting colors that work well together to create dramatic yet harmonious effects.The role of texture in enhancing color and style is then examined. Using fabric, furniture and decorative objects, rooms are completed in several themes including Eastern and modern. In the section on the Eclectic look you see how color and texture are used to pull together diverse items and styles to suit personal taste. Here I found an elegant sitting room with a green velvet couch and animal prints to be quite impressive. I also liked a cozy bedroom with a purple wall and a wrought iron bed.There is an emphasis throughout the book on decorating to satisfy personal taste, style and comfort. Guidance is provided on color schemes to fit different functions and create desired moods. There is a wonderful chapter on bringing the elements of nature into yourhome. The use of natural finishes in woods and fabrics as well as plants and other naturalobjects as decorative accents is employed here.An excellent resource guide is provided. This includes a glossary, a supplier list with web site addresses and directories of designers and photographers. Among many decorating books I have, the emphasis on practicality and livability along with style and creativity make this one of the most useful for me.

This book covers a tremendous variety of collectibles and will be very useful for the collector, established or aspiring dealer. If focuses on items made from the 1940's on, those things that most often turn up at garage sales and flea markets. Certainly the idea behind the book is to inform you of current price trends so you can spot bargains, whether for your own collection or resale. The introduction gives some generally helpful advice on sources and marketing. The impact of the internet is recognized but there are still many hands-on buying opportunities and the information here is equally useful in internet shopping. The prices listed are what are considered to be average dealer retail and do not take into account the huge premiums that some items have achieved in internet sales.Thousands of items are listed in nearly 500 pages. The categories are too numerous to mention in detail but as you would expect, glassware, pottery and porcelain are extensively covered with many styles and manufacturers listed. A few highlights are pictured from each category and the listings are cross-sections of what is available and not intended to be complete lists of everything ever made. A brief background and sources of additional information are included for each category. This may include an expert, collector's club, newsletter or book on the subject.Some of the other sections I found interesting are advertising character collectibles, children's books, Beatles &amp; Elvis collectibles, cameras, cookie jars, dolls, costume jewelry, kitchen items, salt shakers, toys, and yes, even Barbie dolls and Beanie Babies. Also included are items that are just attaining collectible status with unknown potential such as calculators and transistor radios.

My only wish for this book was that a list of suppliers was included.

There is a brief introduction that includes tips on wood selection, use of patterns and finishing. There is also a list of suppliers. Familiarity with the scroll saw process is assumed and the patterns can be resized on a copier to fit your needs. Many of the patterns are versatile and can be used for different applications.Although there are a few of the standard cute animal wall hangings, shelves and such I found many different and useful ideas here. There are Chinese character trivets that go with my Oriental themes and a nice puzzle ball. I think the outstanding piece in the book is a free-standing plant stand that can be sized as needed. This beautiful item is shown on the front cover and is a solid piece of furniture that could be enlarged to be an occasional table with a multitude of uses. A wastepaper basket and flower pot stand in a similar style are also included.There are a number of very nice corner and wall shelf patterns with sophisticated designs including wildlife and a beautiful ballerina. Another of my favorites is a mirror frame capped with a delicate scroll work pattern. With all the scroll saw pattern books out there I found this one to have plenty of unique and useful projects to make it a welcome addition to any collection.

This is a wonderful book for anyone wanting to elements of Asian design, which are so popular today, to their home. With so much to choose from you can't help but be inspired. Sections focus on various principles including simplicity, order, proportion, harmony, balance, color and texture. Examples in photos are accompanied by descriptive text.Since I am a crafter I am always on the lookout for the things I can make for myself and I saw many here that I could. My favorite idea is a Japanese-style dining table that is sunken into the ground. It looks so elegant and I am dreaming of having one someday. They also use lots of screens, which are one of my favorite elements with their beauty and versatility. I though an attic room with a semi-hidden bed was a great idea as well.I appreciate the practical approach here of incorporating authentic Asian design into existing Western homes of various types. If you are looking for some fresh ideas for your home and want a simple, yet elegant style this book will give you some great ideas.

This book is packed with breathtaking photos of beautiful Japanese gardens. The history and philosophy behind the elements in many varied types of gardens is well explained so the reader can understand the significance as well as the beauty.There are sections on the use of various materials including stone, sand, gravel, water and flora of many types. The meticulous design, planning and maintenance of these gardens down to the last stone or leaf is incredible.Among all of the other elements, what most impressed me throughout was the lush greenery. Carefully shaped trees and hedges, and rich beds of moss combine with water and stone to make unique and special places.Though not intended as a &quot;how-to&quot; book, the many examples here provide inspiration to incorporate features of Japanese design into other landscaping settings. These are wonderful places to nurture peace, serenity and contemplation.

I own tons of paper books and this now one of my very favorites. It has many unique and inspirational projects including several styles of invitations, books, baskets, furniture and decorative accents. The instructions are easy-to-follow and step-by-step and including photographic illustrations to guide you.My favorite project is the Chinese slippers made of cardboard. They can be worn once or twice or just used as decoration. I also liked the Egyptian style lampshade made of papyrus and the beautiful wall tiles that can be easily removed and replaced to suit your mood.If you love paper and don't quite know what to do with it, this makes a great gift for a friend or yourself.

I own several books on collage and I found this one to be completely different from the rest. Rather than step-by-step projects it focuses on explaining a wide variety of techniques you can use in your artwork. There are lots of new ideas here that are not discussed in the other collage books.The book starts out a brief history of collage and an overview of art styles such cubism and pop art. Then various collage assembly methods and approaches are discussed. Some include using different adhesives, varnishes and paints. There are some great tips on three-dimensional construction.Many mechanical methods that use computers and copiers are next. Some techniques include blurring, distorting and altering the color of images. This is great for those unfamiliar with computers who would like to use them to make fantastic pieces of art.My favorite section focuses on manipulating photographs. It starts out with basic information on cameras &amp; films. Then it a reviews photographic editing techniques including bleaching, toning, lith-printing, film sandwiching, creating multiple exposures, making photograms and using liquid light to transfer your image to a variety of surfaces.There are also many inspiring full-color artwork examples throughout the book. I found the artwork here to have a different tone than the other collage books I own. You won't find lots of flowers of butterflies here. It tends to be more eclectic or modern than pretty. The accompanying captions in combination with a listing in the back tell the title, size and artist's name as well a bit about the piece and how it was made. Each of the artist's (most are British) addresses are listed as well. A glossary, index and a small list of suppliers are also included. If you are looking for some fresh ideas and new techniques to use in your next collage, this is the book for you.

This is a wonderful book filled with beautiful, unique boxes. Though they can be a bit time consuming, none of the projects are difficult and they can easily be made by a beginning crafter with a little patience.The book starts out with the essentials of tools, materials and adhesives.

Binder's board (Davy board) is the basic structural element for most of the projects. Principles covered include grain direction, parts of the box, measuring, cutting, gluing, covering with paper and fabric and making neat corners.There are 13 different box projects, including a buttonhole stitched box, jewelry box, postcard box, picture frame box, faux book box, ornament box, artist's portfolio and Victorian scrapbook.

Creating exquisite pieces of painted glass is surprisingly quick and easy with this book. I was able to create colorful pieces of glass art with very little time and effort. The key to crafting these designs is the use of color shapers, which are brush-like tools with rubber tips in a variety of shapes and sizes.The book starts out with an overview of basic materials and a baking guide. It then concentrates on each color shaper shape and the brushstrokes it makes. Twelve projects follow covering both flat and curved glass shapes. The instructions are step-by-step accompanied by demonstrating photos and a materials list. The projects are simple, yet elegant and include a striped frame, a lustrous candy dish with leaf design, a multicolor flower pattern vase and a millefiori bowl.My only wish is for list of suppliers that would tell you where to find the wide color shapers. It has taken me months to find them. The projects here make great inexpensive decorative accents for your home as well as great gifts for your friends. This book would also make a super housewarming gift for the crafter in your life.

This is a fun book for anyone who fondly remembers wild Sixties style. It is also a valuable source of ideas and techniques for the crafter who enjoys making useful and decorative items from found objects and junk.There is an introduction on basic techniques followed by 39 projects. There is great variety, including clothing and accessories, jewelry, furniture, d&eacute;cor items and toys. The materials used are just as varied and the style is colorful. Depending on your taste you could call it anything from modern folk art to tacky trash. The beauty of the book is that even if you don't like the style, many of the ideas could be easily adapted to other styles by using different materials.For each project there is a list of exactly what you will need and step-by-step instructions with diagrams and a color photo of the finished piece. The spiral binding makes it easy to lay the book flat while you are working. This book is a great combination of practicality, whimsy and fun.

I love Asian design have been waiting a long time for a book like this to come out. The book is in full-color and there are step-by-step instructions, accompanied by photos, for each project. The 20 projects for a wide variety of decorative and useful items in Japanese style use materials including fabric, bamboo, cane, reed, paper, wood, and stone. Conveniently there are templates and a resource list in back.A few projects require basic sewing skills and a sewing machine. These include elegant sashiko table mats, a bolster cushion, an appliqued curtain, raffia footstool and a floor cushion. Others require basic woodworking skills and power tools such as a miter saw, tenon saw or router. Some of these include a reed screen, peaceful water garden, wooden bath mat, exquisite lacquered tea tray, towel rail and soap dish.Some simpler projects that don't require any special tools or skills include a paper and rattan tray, woven cane lamp, momigami lamp, a beautiful paneled paper hanging, tall vases, paper mache bowls, concrete candle holder, and a shoe rack. My favorite project was the bamboo table with a glass top. These are great accessories for any home that features Asian accents or design and would be great finishing touches for a house done in traditional Japanese style.

I found this book very helpful in learning to use all of Painter's features effectively. It was easy to read &amp; has lots of good photos. My only wish is that it had more accurate instructions on using the CD.My favorite section was on the Painter pallets. It shows example pictures for each &quot;brush&quot; &amp; it's variants. Sample photos also showed the various options available in the gradient box. These made it far easier to know what tool to use.Other sections of the book covered masking, image hose use, painting &amp; composite techniques, special effects, working with type, enhancing &amp; outputting images, animation &amp; web application, and using Painter with other programs.The CD contains some good movies on making blobs, creating an image hose from a floater, building and editing floaters maps and making mosaic or patterned type.

This is one of the best books on color theory I have found. I like pastel colors best and I am glad to have found a book specifically focused on them. The color themes really help you set the right mood and with such a variety of color combinations for each one anyone can find something to suit their taste. It has been an invaluable reference tool in helping me decorate my home.The book starts out with a brief explanation of the color wheel and a color chart. It is then divided into several color themes. These include blush, ripe, ambrosial, sweet, appealing, fresh, calm, refreshing, charming, old-fashioned, ethereal, vivacious, iridescent and subtle. Each theme focuses on a color or group of colors such as yellow-green for fresh, violet for ethereal and blue-violet for old-fashioned. Monochromatic, analogous, complementary, clash, split-complementary, and neutral color schemes are shown in color swatches for each theme. A process color conversion chart is included in the back.This book is set up like the Color Harmony Workbook, but has a few less color schemes for each color theme, although there are many color themes here that are not contained in Home Color Workbook. This is a great addition to those volumes or a less expensive substitute for those who just like pastels color schemes. In the back there is a process color conversion chart and 152 cut-out color swatches with CMYK information on the backs.

This book delves into the fascinating technique of adding collage elements to watercolor paintings. Basically, this is adding bits of paper of various shapes, textures &amp; colors to the surface to enhance the painting over them.Experimentation to develop a personal style is stressed here. Basic principles of texture, layering, contrast and color are explored first. Then you see how these elements are incorporated into finished paintings.The author is an accomplished master of this technique. Many examples of his work are shown in progress &amp; completed. He emphasizes throughout how artists of any level in any medium can apply these concepts to their work.Whether or not you decide to emulate Brommer's work, this book is a great springboard of ideas and ways of looking at the painting process. It is filled with solid and helpful ideas.

Line brush strokes, washes and calligraphy brushwork are then detailed &amp; illustrated.The author then talks about the four gentlemen of Japan.
