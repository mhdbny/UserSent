I can't add much to the other reviews, except to express a desire that people who want to talk about economics on public forums should at least have read this book, or Sowell's "Basic Economics." Just that one little desire!Then we would not have ill-informed citizens and voters declaring that "the economy is all about jobs and full employment." That's actually wrong. The economy is all about producing goods and services that other people want. You can get to "full employment" with a Nazi slave society, folks, or with a public make-works project that accomplishes nothing.Then we would not have ill-informed citizens and voters declaring that the government must subsidize General Motors. Or Citibank. Or anybody else!I can summarize this book's one lesson quite briefly: "bad economics always focuses on the good effects of a government policy towards one particular special-interest group." (Translate: Obama's "porkfest" bill.) "Good economics looks further: it looks, first, to the effect of that policy on 'the forgotten man' --- to the person who is NOT a beneficiary of the policy." (That would be us taxpayers, stuck with a bill for a trillion dollars.) "Second, it looks at the long-term effects of that policy." (That would be "another day older, and deeper in debt.")Speaking just for myself, I find it amazing that the current resident in the White House and his team have apparently never read this book.

I feel like cynically following the headline above by observing that this film was a box-office disaster. So far as I can tell, $10m was allotted to film it, and it raked in a whopping $6m at the box-office.Well, so what. As Ezra Pound wisely commented about books, many years ago, "Pay no attention to literary prizes, not even the Nobel." And how wise his words were! So I regard the fact that this film won an Oscar for its screenplay as nice, but not thrilling.It is not hard to see why the film failed at the box-office. There are no car chases, no explosions, no good-looking babes removing their wet T-shirts: it is very far from being a film for "Joe Six-Pack," as another trenchant reviewer pointed out.What it is, is a masterpiece. I doubt that I will ever see Ian McKellen give a better performance -- unless I win the lottery and can travel to England for a live performance! :-) But, much more interesting than that, is the simple fact that the entire film is superbly acted, from the first frame to the last. There is not a bad performance in the lot; more surprisingly, there is not even a weak performance!I found the story to be extremely moving and involving -- approximately a hundred times more interesting than the clumsy mechanics on display in "Brokeback Mountain." It is a movie with a gay theme...well, no. Let's say more than that: it is the story of an old man, James Whale, who is utterly and completely gay. "Jimmy" has suffered a stroke, and his mind is beginning to go. This overwhelming, unbearable reality is dealt with while two other people observe, take part, and try to help: his long-time maid, and his handsome gardener. This may seem like a very unlikely story to interest anyone, but for me it is simply one of the finest films ever made. My highest congratulations to everyone involved with the project. And I'll predict that, before long, "Gods and Monsters" will be made part of the Criterion Collection, and will begin its journey into film immortality. It is THAT GOOD.

Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was "learn a useful trade." As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book! It's an excellent portrait of America in the late 19th century, and it will surprise you at many turns.

I don't want to appear as an ally of Satan (God forbid!), but I don't think this is the impeccably argued treatise so many people think it is.It appears to be a work of propaganda more than a work of philosophy. I have in mind, particularly, the giant switcheroo pulled on the reader between Book I and Book II.Book I is a reasonable discussion of the "moral sense" or "moral law" in human beings, something which made a great impression on Kant and, more recently, on Anthony Flew. From this, Lewis argues himself to a position which he himself calls "theism," and at one point warns the reader that any discussion of Christianity is "a hundred miles off."Well, it's not.Flip the pages to Book II, and suddenly you are plunged into the thick of organized religions -- how some of them are pantheistic, etc. etc. And then we go right into the question of Jesus Christ. Lewis famously insists that Jesus was (a) God himself in human form (b) a loonie or (c) something much worse, such as an emanation from Satan.In my opinion, he ignores the gospel record. If you pick up Mark and read it dispassionately, you will discover that Jesus was a faith-healer, an exorcist, and a miracle-worker. According to Schweitzer, he predicted his second coming within the lifetime of his disciples. I don't need to pick one of the cards which C. S. Lewis tries to force on me; I simply note that he was wrong. (Lewis does not even mention this problem, technically known as the "delayed parousia.")This is not a convincing book, and I will continue to regard Lewis as a second-rate author.

I suppose many literary critics would put (say) Dante & Shakespeare on the A-team, and writers like Somerset Maugham on the B-team, while writers (actually, teams of writers) such as Alexandre Dumas would be shoved onto the C-team...maybe even worse!But somehow we have to reckon with the fact that this is the most popular story ever told, and the most widely-loved novel in the world. If it's not exactly the #1 champion, it's sure among the front-runners. It's simply a sprawling, thrilling tale, which reaches out and touches most people right where they live: "Boy, if I had a million dollars, I'd show them!" "The Count of Monte Cristo" turns this theme into a sometimes savage, sometimes heart-breaking tale of the revenge of an innocent man wronged, but the theme can also be treated as high humor ("The Secret Life of Walter Mitty") and surely is not unknown to music (see Madonna's "You'll See.")Anyway, I'm not going to even summarize the plot --- not even going to try. I'll just say this: if you haven't read this book, put it on your list. It's a superb tale from a master story-teller!Highest recommendation!

Just for "truth in reviewing," I have to state that Kinsey has always been one of my heroes, just as he was a hero to the final interviewee in the film, who blessed him for saving her life. Even while I was a teenager, Kinsey's "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" was on my bookshelf, and had pride of place.Over the years, details about the man himself have become more public, and it becomes clear that Kinsey was (surprise!) not actually a perfect human being. Well, my own search for one of those still continues. :-)It should not be surprising to learn that Kinsey was a driven man ("relentless"). He was a workaholic. Before even beginning his research into sex, he collected a MILLION specimens of the gall-wasp, and made his reputation as a biologist. Something else the film pays little attention to: he wrote one of the standard college textbooks on biology, which sold very well for decades and made him a much more independent man.I'm not sure that the film deals completely with Kinsey's apparent awakening to his own homosexuality. But it certainly does not skate over this interesting fact.Kinsey's sexual orientation was not his fatal flaw, in my opinion. That flaw may be summed up in one simple sentence: "I can live without sex, but I can't live without love." Kinsey was a man of his times, and so he was a behaviorist. He refused to deal with love, because he couldn't measure it. (And there's a nice question: how indeed can you measure the infinite?) So Kinsey collected samples, and counted. His entire research on one human being was reduced to one Hollerith card (AKA "IBM punch card," something which I believe no longer exists).But still --- the man was not a devil; he was basically a worker-bee. Who else could have produced his two monumental works on "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" and "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female?" Mistitled works, though: they should have been called "Sexual Behavior in the White American Male" and "Sexual Behavior in the White American Female."All of this complexity is on view in this film, which really surprised me. The film avoids painting Kinsey as a Great Liberator, and it also avoids painting him as a Great Satan. What he was is quite obvious: a man who did objective research into things which had previously been unmentionable in Puritan America.An excellent movie!

This book just recently showed up at my house from a second-hand dealer, and I am already in love with it. It was published by the Folio Society in 1975 -- 32 years ago -- yet my copy seems almost new. The binding, typesetting, and editing are all first-rate.They say that Queen Victoria kept two books for bedtime reading -- the Bible and "In Memoriam." I think she would have been delighted to have this edition.So much for the physical presentation. The poem itself is a masterpiece, composed on and off over 18 years, as Tennyson tried to reconcile himself to the death of his best friend, Arthur Hallam, a brilliant man who had just become engaged to Tennyson's sister, when a sudden stroke put his light out forever at the age of 31 or 32. Literally full of life one minute, and a lifeless corpse the next.This unspeakable tragedy caused great philosophical and religious problems for Tennyson, which are all set down here in immortal verse.Highest possible recommendation!

Granted, nineteenth-century Russia was almost a different planet from modern America. But what do you think of these comments about the Frenchified Russians Dostoevsky disliked?"It may be that reality around us looks none too lovely even yet; but then we are so wonderful ourselves, so civilized, so European that the common people feel sick at the very sight of us. We have now reached the point where the common people regard us as complete foreigners, and do not understand a single word of ours --- and this certainly is progress, whatever you say. We have now reached a point where our contempt for the common people and the basic principles of their being is so profound that even our attitude to them is stamped with a new, unprecedented and kind of supercilious disdain...and this is progress, whatever you say."And then how self-confident we now are in our civilizing mission, with what an air of superiority we solve all problems, and what problems! There is no soil, we say, and no people, nationality is nothing but a certain system of taxation, the soul is a tabula rasa, a small piece of wax out of which you can readily mould a real man or a homunculus --- all that must be done is to apply the fruits of European civilization and read two or three books. And then how serene, how majestically serene we are, because we have solved all problems and written them off."For some strange reason, this passage made me think of the current situation in the United States.Maybe we need to craft our own solutions to our problems, and not rely on the Wisdom of the French!"Whatever you say," this is a very interesting book, in which Dostoevsky sometimes sounds just like H. L. Mencken.By the way, Joseph Frank, who wrote the book on Dostoevsky, thinks that "Winter Notes on Summer Impressions" is, in an important way, a preliminary draft of that strange masterpiece,Notes from the Underground.Highly recommended for a cold winter night!

The central question discussed in this book is: why the Dark Ages? Why did Europe take such a catastrophic slide backwards?Pirenne's answer is that Arab conquerors turned the Mediterranean into a Muslim lake, and, as a result, trade plummeted and Europe went into an economic death-spiral.Unfortunately, this answer does not satisfy many modern historians. At their boldest, they claim that Pirenne was trying to explain something ("The Dark Ages") that simply did not exist. You might want to argue about that, but there is very little argument about the idea of the "Muslim Lake." In fact, during most of the period under investigation, the Eastern Mediterranean was a Byzantinue lake!Let us not forget that Muhammad and his tribes were people of the desert, who knew everything about camels but nothing at all about ships: "Muslim fleets" were built by non-Arabs (and non-Muslims) and they were also staffed by mercenaries who knew which way the winds blew in the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, the "Muslim fleets" were annihilated by the Byzantine "secret weapon" known as "Greek Fire."To cap it all off, there is no evidence at all that trade between Europe and the Middle East took a fall. Prof. Pirenne thought he had found some, but modern research has found a lot more which contradicts the fragments he found.As for those pesky "Dark Ages," they were not as productive of books and high intellectual culture, which academics love, but they were extremely productive in inventions which enabled farmers to produce more and people to eat more: the deep plow with moldboard, the three-field cropping system, the breeding and use of really big horses to use as draft animals and "war horses," chain-mail armor, the high-backed saddle, the stirrup, the crossbow...the era was not really dark at all, but does rather raise the question of why all these crucial innovations had to await the fall of the Roman Empire.I suspect that a couple of books will help you explore these problems: Rodney Stark'sGod's Battalions: The Case for the Crusadesand the same author'sThe Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success.But the main one is Peter Brown'sThe Rise of Western Christendom: Triumph and Diversity, A.D. 200-1000, 2nd Edition (The Making of Europe).

Unless you MUST have a small, light edition of "The Story of Art," you will fare much better with the regular 16th edition.Why?In this "Pocket Edition," the text and illustrations have been separated. The text comes up front, and all the plates are at the back. In my opinion, a terrible idea, mostly because the author refers CONSTANTLY to the plates.The publishers apparently realized there was a problem with this misorganization, because they supplied two ribbon book-markers -- one to mark your place in the text, and the other to mark your place in the plates.The result is a study in frustration, trying to keep both markers in place while trying to follow the author's discussion. In my case, updating the markers actually caused me to lose the thread of the discussion.How much better it is, to have the illustrations printed right alongside the text, which is the way the book has always been printed.Get the 16th edition and save your money.

If you want to understand Plato, I can heartily recommend a two-step process.First, read up on him in Copleston'sA History of Philosophy, Vol. 1: Greece and Rome From the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus. You would probably want to read about the pre-Socratics and the Sophists as well.Then, get yourself a copy of this book, and go through it, dialogue by dialogue. I don't think you can go far wrong, and you will have a firm understanding of one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived --- well, two, if you count Socrates!

Like many other people who were taken in, I was shocked to discover that the entire Introduction had vanished "somewhere" --- terminated halfway down the first page with a question mark.The rest of the book is set in an awful font (think Courier 10) and riddled with typos --- to such an extent that you actually wonder whether you are getting Chesterton's thoughts. What does it mean for something to be called "mook?" Is that the OCR software going crazy over "meek" or "moo?"Obviously the book was never edited at all; no editor could have possibly overlooked the missing Introduction.DO NOT BUY THIS MISERABLE THING.

I don't know who to praise more, the brilliant Austrian conductor Franz Welser-Most, or the "always surprising" Cleveland Symphony.Not to mention the composer, Anton Bruckner. His eighth symphony is a masterpiece: some people view it as the devout Bruckner having a conversation with God. That may or may not be true, but it is well worth listening in on the conversation.The DVD is riveting, and it's one of the finest I own.I would like to hear from the Bruckner experts, however --- what is their opinion of this performance as opposed to the one on the Karajan boxed set of the complete Bruckner symphonies?

I had to discover G. K. Chesterton all by myself, when I was a teenager --- in the school library. He had written so many books, on so many interesting topics! I borrowed four or five and was enthralled by his humor, his clear insight, and his brilliant writing style.Take this book "Orthodoxy." Could there be a more boring title? Yet, if you dare to open to the first page, you're off on a wild, non-stop ride where Chesterton makes a number of points that seem to me beyond dispute.After all, you would not really expect Chapter One of such a presumably "dull" book to be about maniacs, but it is. And Chesterton makes one point over and over again: the people who become insane typically reason too much. A paranoid psychotic is full of reasons and logical arguments which all seem to make perfect sense, but the lunatic remains, unfortunately, a lunatic. If I may draw a parallel to today, the people who believe in UFO's (or the Truthers) are all full of logical arguments which they will gladly repeat, and repeat endlessly, forever travelling around the circumference of the tiny circle which imprisons them.On the other hand, men of great imagination seem to be marvellously sane. Chesterton mentions Shakespeare; a more modern writer might mention Tolkien. They were both men of stupendous imagination, and they did NOT live within the tiny "logical" world of their own madness.As chance would have it, I am investigating Kant right now, and everything I have read up to this point tells me that Kant ringingly "proved" that the outside world exists pretty much as we observe it.This may be a really important point for philosophers, but it is not something which needs argument with the huge majority of people. You see your girl-friend kissing another guy, and you don't go to Kant for the answer to the question "What do I do NOW?" Kant is not precisely an expert on the jealous heart, although he would be sure to remind you that both your girl-friend and the other guy must be treated as "ends in themselves."No. Mankind has always gone to religion to answer the really tough questions about being human, and the orthodox Christian will run right up against the commandment "Thou shalt not kill."What Chesterton does, is to put such issues into bold relief. If you go to an atheist materialist such as I believe Dawkins to be, he may well be a determinist to boot, and feel that it is a waste of time to even speak with you, since *FATE* is the master of all, and there is no *FREE WILL*. Oddly enough, the man who denies these ideas is quite likely to be a Catholic priest. And he'll bring up the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" without apology or even much explanation.Most of this book is a ringing and funny defense of "common sense" --- and the sense of wonder which existence often brings to us. After all, even Immanuel Kant had on his tombstone:"Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence, the more often and the more steadily we meditate upon them: *the starry firmament above* and *the moral sense within.* "You might consider reading this book along withThe Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions. They are both excellent, funny, and stimulating!A Chesterton quote from "Orthodoxy" to ponder: "It is true that a man (a silly man) might make change itself his obect or ideal. But as an ideal, change itself becomes unchangeable. If the change-worshiper wishes to estimate his own progress, he must be sternly loyal to the ideal of change; he must not begin to flirt gaily with the ideal of monotony. Progress itself cannot progress."To sum up: "Orthodoxy" is simply a classic.

Somehow, "The Way of All Flesh" doesn't make it on to many lists of "the world's greatest novels." I'm not sure why.There is a specific edition of this book which I love, and which can be found easily among used-book dealers. This edition was issued by The Heritage Press, and contains a remarkable introduction by Theodore Dreiser. The introduction is something which I have re-read many times. As a beginning, Dreiser recounts his interaction with an intelligent American engineer, aged about 40, who was looking for a book "with some meat to it." After long hesitation, and after compiling a list of some dozen books, Dreiser finally decided to recommend "The Way of All Flesh."Six months later, he met the engineer by chance while strolling along a street in San Francisco, and the engineer immediately started praising the novel. "Now there is a book which is honest! I can't think of another book from its time which contains more honesty, and more direct dealing!"And indeed, this may be the main thing working in favor of "The Way of All Flesh." Samuel Butler read Darwin, and became a believer in the theory of evolution. He was a penetrating observer of the cruelties of Victorian society, and of its hypocrisies. Few people will read this book without being able to remember this startlingly honest portrayal of a man who has just lost his wife, whom he did not love in the slightest:"Theobald buried his face in his hands to conceal his want of emotion."Oh, touche!But other themes are extremely interesting: the idea of taking up a Christian vocation and going into the slums to dedicate your life to serving the poor -- it might work, but it might be a dreadful idea if you don't know what you're doing.And how about the narrator's bald statement:"I know of no better thing for a young man than an independent income." (!!) That sentiment is not going to sit well with the people who believe that only a lifetime of wage-slavery is worth living! But Samuel Butler spoke from experience: when he was in his twenties, he escaped to New Zealand and took up sheep-farming, of all things. But... he did WELL as a sheep-farmer, sold out five years later at a very nice profit, and cleared eight thousand pounds. He invested it at ten percent and therefore had an independent income of eight hundred pounds per year. He returned to London, rented an apartment, and devoted the rest of his life to his intellectual life: writing, painting, and music. He is well-known as the author of "Erewhon," as well as "The Way of All Flesh."You should really take a look at this book. In some ways, it has shaped my life, in ways that sometimes surprise me. There's a lot of good, honest meat in this book -- and that's probably why it has been continuously in print for over a century, despite the fact that the academics pass over it in silence.Extremely high recommendation!

It's funny, whenever I use those words "one of the best novels ever written," I seem to be writing about some book which the Anointed Professors of English Literature never even think about."Kim" is a great example of that. I read it first when I was about 13, and loved it. I re-read it as an adult, and got a lot more out of it. For one thing, Kipling knew what he was talking about. While leftist professors would bleat of imperialism, racial oppression, colonialism, deconstruction and the rest, Kipling was actually way ahead of them. He obviously was aware of the British Raj in India, but he rather turned the situation on its head by making his hero a neglected and impoverished English boy.So the novel deals with a situation where the British are "oppressing" the Indians, and among those "Indians" is a no-account slum-dwelling English boy --- and his best friend, a wandering Tibetan monk. These two embark on a quest: Kim searching for the regiment of his long-gone father, the monk searching for his mystic river. Along the way, they meet a fantastic and believable cast of characters, painted with a true artist's brush --- the brush of an artist who truly loved India.Another novel I mention in this category isThe Moonstone (Barnes & Noble Classics)which is to my mind superior to almost anything Dickens ever wrote. And then we haveThe Way of All Flesh...that's enough for now!Happy reading to you!

G. K. Chesterton has written a brilliant introduction to a medieval philosopher who used to give me the horrors (for no particular reason other than youthful ignorance.) Whether you love him or hate him, it is clear that Thomas Aquinas was one of the towering geniuses of human history -- right up there with Einstein and Newton. In addition to that, this "Dumb Ox" seems to have been a genuinely sweet and friendly man, who couldn't be too friendly because his mind was always beckoned back to the enchanted fields of philosophy. There seems no doubt that he was the greatest philosopher since Aristotle, and maybe the greatest ever.He's also highly reliable, much to my surprise. Mortimer Adler has published an interesting book called "Ten Philosophical Mistakes," and it's interesting to note the first one, too complex to explain here, is a mistake which Aquinas DOES NOT MAKE. Unlike amateurs such as the Baron d'Holbach, Thomas is well aware that man has free will, a conscience, and a moral duty. Again, unlike Holbach, Aquinas is quite sure that God exists, that man has a soul, and that the soul is immortal. Unlike the Baron, however, Aquinas explains why he believes each of these things, in impeccably clear language. (If he gets too complicated for you to understand, that's because he is discussing extremely complicated things.) He is so good that one is tempted to throw in the towel and regard all subsequent philosophy as a lot of egotistical, academic, boring chatter. And, amazingly enough, you can reach this conclusion without even being a Christian! (I'm not.)Chesterton manages to deal with all this in a short, fascinating book. The only complaint I have is about this particular Kindle edition, which is riddled with typos generated by the lousy OCR software used, plus evidently a complete lack of editorial overview. These typos average as high as three or four to a page, which is really kind of ridiculous. I finally ordered the book,St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Francis of Assisi: With Introductions by Ralph McInerny and Joseph Pearcejust to have these two small masterpieces as a book for my library.

Bring your oxometer, and try to keep a straight faceDerek Bickerton, in "Language and Species," gives us an example of language creating concepts: a friend declares that, to evaluate a certain speech, he would really need his "oxometer." What's that? Oh, "it measures the percentage of BS in things." Hmm, could be a useful tool-- but it doesn't exist.If there were such a thing, it would register very nearly 100 percent when presented with this absurd book.Why do I call it absurd? Well, take a look at this statement, which Father Teilhard considered so important that it deserved a whole paragraph to itself:"In the last analysis the best guarantee that a thing should happen is that it appears to us as vitally necessary."So -- using our powers of analytical thinking -- we can reduce this sentence to the proposition that we will get whatever we really need. Which is nonsense, as every failed lottery contestant and starving infant can assure you.As those eminent philosophers The Rolling Stones once said, "You can't always get what you want, but if you try real hard, you just might find that you get what you need." The Stones seem to disagree with Father Teilhard -- the Stones seem to think that some human effort is necessary in order to get what you need.None of this is scientific thinking, of course. So how did this book ever get a reputation as a scientific book?Well, part of it is "jumping on the bandwagon." As Brian Silver brilliantly shows in "The Ascent of Science," every major scientific discovery has been pounced on by the ignorant and mistakenly applied to everything under the sun. Newton's Laws of Motion were applied to politics, medicine, and human behavior. David Hume thought he saw "inertia" in thought! ("Every thought will continue thinking in the same direction at a constant speed unless acted on by some force?")Similarly, the law of universal gravitation was dragged into politics, biology, and chemistry. And the same fate lurked for Einstein and Darwin, naturally.Charles, meet Father Teilhard! The fundamental process or motion in the universe is evolution, and evolution is "a general condition to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must bow..." Now, there is the biggest bandwagon-jump I have ever seen!All theories must bow to the general law of evolution? Really? How about Newton's Laws of Motion? They haven't evolved a bit during the history of the universe. How about rocks? They haven't evolved and never will.Evolution is a discovery about life and DNA. It is not applicable outside the realm of biology. Get a grip, folks. "The universe" is not "evolving." Life is evolving. Computers are not "evolving" -- unless you use language loosely. Evolution is a process governing living organisms only.There is much more and much worse in this awful book. As Brian Silver remarked, "Here we are in the land of unprovable statements, abuse of language, and everything that has given mysticism a bad name." Just like a TV psychic babbling of "focusing cosmic energy," Father Teilhard takes strictly defined terms such as "energy," uses them in the loosest metaphorical way, and then pretends that his "energy" corresponds to the "energy" found in a scientific text.As Peter Medawar brilliantly remarked, this sort of book finds a huge audience among people who have been educated far beyond their capacity to undertake analytical thought.

This is absolutely one of my favorite novels by Balzac; his character invention soars to new heights with his creation of Sylvain Pons and his best friend, a German named Schmucke.SPOILERS AHEADPons is the protagonist; a musician who almost made it to the big time, but didn't pay enough attention to his orchestration. Now he gives private lessons and conducts a theatrical orchestra, and barely gets by.Pons is dominated by two very different manias. The first is collecting small works of "bric-a-brac," which includes such masterpieces as a fan created by Watteau for Mme Pompadour, which Pons manages to acquire for ten francs (it is worth thousands). His private museum contains 2,000 wonderful works of art, probably worth a million francs all told --- although he would never dream of selling them. His second mania, alas, is gourmet dining. He has learned, and learned well, what truly fine food and wine taste like, and he's addicted. He became addicted when he was a popular young musician during the Empire, but now he has fallen to the status of a mere parasite, a "hanger-on," a poor relation. At the time the story opens, he is barely tolerated --- almost openly mocked --- at the homes where he appears "just at suppertime."Like many Balzac novels, this one does not keep you in the dark about exactly how much money each character has, in property and income, and the eternal Parisian struggle for more money and higher status. Suffice it to say that Pons' richie relatives look upon him as a fool until a crisis puts him at death's door, and the richies learn about his magnificent art collection. Understanding nothing of art whatsoever, these ignorant clods understand a million francs perfectly, and so the last days of Sylvain Pons must be devoted to defending his property against those richie relatives, who reveal themselves as unscrupulous thieves.It's not cheerful reading, but tragedies rarely are. "Cousin Pons" will leave you shivering with horror, and asking yourself, "Is this really what mankind amounts to?"If you enjoy this, there is a lot more excellent stuff where this came from!

Other reviewers have commented on the details, and very well, so I feel like commenting on the social framework where this movie was made. It will probably seem incredible to humans of the future, but there was indeed a time when love was confined to members of the opposite sex.That is to say, whenever we discovered that two people were in love, our FIRST QUESTION was to inspect their gender. If the genders were different, then clear sailing lay ahead. If the genders were the same, then obviously the lovers needed to be taken out and shot.This film, "Maurice," comes from the novel by E. M. Forster, who avoided the penalty of being taken out and shot by his extreme discretion -- including, among other things, NOT publishing this novel until he was dead.Think about this. Meditate on this. One of the best writers of the last century decided that the world could simply not accept his tale of love.

I have just been reading through reviews (positive & negative) of Oliver Stone's attempt to "do" Alexander the Great. And it struck me that those people were simply wasting their time.If you want to know about Alexander the Great, read Mary Renault. If you want to understand Ancient Greece, read Mary Renault.Oliver Stone does not even come close."The Persian Boy" is one of the best romantic novels ever written. It is thrilling and exciting stuff from beginning to end. And it is, fundamentally, as true a story we can expect about a man who has been dead for almost three thousand years. This wonderful novel will expand your mind; watching the Oliver Stone movie will make it shrink. It's just that simple.

My first look at this film left me depressed, because both of the main characters gave enormous proof that they were, well, creeps. More than that, a little research into the "truth" leaves the reader with the same idea. For example, Rimbaud's life has been extensively documented inRimbaud: A Biography, where Rimbaud comes off as even more creepy than he does in this film. Verlaine is hardly an admirable figure, given his brutal mistreatment of his wife, and his weepy drunken Catholicism, not to mention his weepy worship of the teenage "god" Rimbaud.However, I must say that when I went back to watch this film again (with teeth clenched), I saw something different: a tale of a gigantic passion between two deeply flawed men. And that means that the film captures a very important thing: the historical truth. It may strike us as "unbelievable," but that's the way this mad passion played out.This is probably Leonardo's best performance. The fact that he was superbly cast doesn't hurt a bit either. That is to say, if you want the audience to believe the idea that Paul Verlaine would abandon his pretty young wife for some unknown boy from the provinces, it helps to have a wildly attractive actor playing the part of the boy from the provinces. :-)

The condensed edition of this book: "Men function well, in teams, and women do not." You might go on to add that men "naturally" do this.I suspect that there must be something biological, or genetic, in this obvious truth. Who knows? But I have heard curses from men who are coaching teams of women (soccer, basketball, etc.): "They just don't GET IT!"The reviewer who claims that the book is "obsolete," in my opinion, has a highly-inflated idea of human flexibility.Nevertheless, although this is a "ground-breaking" book, I find that it has aged, and it has not aged well. I don't know whether Lionel Tiger was simply too lazy to attempt a revision of this book, or whether his mind has gone to sleep over the last fifty years. Whatever: there are false notes struck on almost every page, and they are mostly political false notes. An example would be Lionel Tiger smugly asserting that racial segregation in America was due to whites not wanting to live with blacks. It does not even seem to occur to him that there is another side of the coin: that blacks do not want to live with whites. Even more incredible (for Tiger) is the concept that this might be a pretty good way to arrange life: whites and blacks do not necessarily live cheek-by-jowl, but perhaps in adjoining suburbs, where they have softball games on the weekends. OK, the whites probably lose the softball games most of the time, but why is this sort of living pattern assumed to be unthinkable?Another example is Tiger's feminism: he actively wants more women participating in politics. ("Why?" does not seem to occur to him.) He confesses that the political strength of men in groups is going to make realizing that goal very difficult, and therefore *profound political changes might be necessary to achieve this goal.* Making "profound political changes" to achieve some (perhaps imaginary) goal is actually an extremely dangerous idea, and I suspect that its time is very nearly over.A lot of important data is gathered here. I don't think it's well organized, but it is at least *gathered.*But I don't think any of this changes the fact that men naturally tend to form self-selected teams. If you have a social unit with fifteen guys in it, perhaps seven or eight will form themselves into a team. They will probably do it (in Western society) by trading insults (in person or over the Internet). Very often, a guy's "mates" are among the most important things in his life. An entrepreneur in New Zealand; a college boy in Chiang Mai; a Burmese refugee who has a pack of at least twenty friends --- find me a woman who operates like these guys. :-)Why do we Western folks need an entire book to document the obvious? Search me!

NOTE: This review refers to ISBN 1-58243-103-5. This is a reprint edition of the original Heritage Press publication, in 1949, of M.F.K. Fisher's translation of Brillat-Savarin. As issued, the book is simply titled "The Physiology of Taste, or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy."Now, with those details out of the way, let me make bold to say that this is one of the world's great books!When I first began reading it, I became annoyed: "Who is this Frenchman, who thinks he can write about, and tell me about, everything under the sun?" For the book contains many, many digressions. I have seen it referred to as a "cookbook," which is wildly wrong -- it is MEANT to be a book about food and the art of cooking food. And no less about the art of eating food.But the many digressions are the key to this wonderful book.A brief biography: born in 1755, trained as a lawyer, Brillat-Savarin became the mayor of his home town, Belley. But he fled France at the time of the Revolution, and went to America. After his brief exile, he returned to Paris and served as a judge in the court of appeals. He spent the last twenty-five years of his life living peacefully, and writing this book.Did he know that he was creating a masterpiece? Interesting question!As his intrepid translator, M.F.K. Fisher comments, this seems to be a book which will last more than a century or two. It may well live for thousands of years.WHY?Because of the personality and intelligence of the author! Just like Fisher, I wish that I had been one of his friends! And, when push comes to shove, one purpose of a library is to provide an army of friends, hopefully intelligent, gentle, serene, and perceptive. Brillat-Savarin is all of these.One sample discussion that I can recall from memory is about the ability of various men to enjoy tasty food. And Brillat-Savarin puts his point simply and unforgettably: there are men born blind, and men born lame, and men born deaf. On the other hand, there are men born with sight, men born with normal mobility, and men who can hear. In the same way, some men are born with an inability to appreciate delicious food, due to a lack of taste-buds on the tongue or whatever, BUT there are men who are born loving tasty food -- and I am writing my book about and for these people! :-)Be careful about buying this book! It may wind up on your nightstand for a long, long, time. Fine wine indeed, from a truly vintage mind -- and a truly fine translator.Also beware: it may make you hungry! :-)

I was looking forward to this book, but was disappointed by the amount of math it contained.I guess I was hoping for a book more likeFermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem, which "explains" some of the most complex math in the world (I guess) in a way that even non-math-lovers can "understand."Still, it's very well-written, and I'll probably be absorbing it, bit by bit, in very small chunks. I used to love geometry and Euclid, but I've forgotten almost all of it. Here's a hint by way of a question: if you have nothing but a compass, an unmarked ruler, and a pencil, how do you bisect a line? (Blush...I had to look it up online!)If you're a math-lover, though, you'll probably enjoy this book thoroughly!!

This is the best performance of the Tchaikovsky 6th that I have ever heard. Celibidache takes it a bit slower than other conductors, but the reward is hearing every note played correctly in a totally musical performance.Does he outdo Leonard Bernstein? I think so, but you should get both performances and make up your own mind. I'm just here to tell you that this performance of the symphony is world-class, and maybe the best ever.

This is just one more excellent book from Simon Singh. It probably had less to surprise me than his other books, since I am a long-time fan ofThe Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet.But I would like to break away from reviewing this book (which already has more than 200 reviews) to make a more general statement: Simon Singh has written three books that I know of, and THEY ARE ALL EXCELLENT. You should not missBig Bang: The Origin of the Universe (P.S.), nor should you overlook my favorite,Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem.

I apologize for stealing my review title from another reviewer. But that reviewer really put it well: how could a movie about a MEAL be interesting, in any way, shape, or form? More than that: how could it be a masterpiece?I can only offer my own insight that masterpieces are almost always complete surprises. A good example is "The Little Prince," which is "only" a silly short book about some imaginary prince-boy living way off in outer space, with clumsy illustrations by the author to boot. But it's a masterpiece: it has been translated into umpteen languages, and has sold more millions of copies than I would ever be able to count.Why? I would guess it's because the characters, through the magic of fiction, reach out and grab you and make you care about them."Strangely enough," the same is true of "Babette's Feast." It takes place in a tiny fishing community, and has what must be the most vivid characters I have seen in years. No, not Fellini's gross exaggerations: we are looking at Real People here, and the values which shape their actions and their lives. There are important themes in the movie, very important ones: is being "morally good" enough to guarantee happiness? Or is there a role for simple pleasure in the grand scheme of things? The film does not really answer these questions, but it does ask them, and it suggests that a radical religious Puritanism, which turns all pleasure aside at the door, may not be the complete definition of the good life. (In this context, you might to look at Henry James's movel, "The Europeans." Did Isak Dineson read that novel, I wonder?)The movie is, on one level, a comic delight --- a wonderful light comedy. But it probes some of the deepest questions we ever have to ask ourselves. We may all admit that a life spent giddily pursuing pleasure is bound to be superficial, but is there really any point to denying ourselves the pleasures that life offers?A world-famous writer used to fry (!) Oscar Mayer bologna, and eat it with Campbell's soup. One wonders what he would have thought of Babette's feast.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!

First, I want to be clear about which edition of "Quo Vadis" I am reviewing here: it is the edition from Hippocrene Books, ISBN 0781805503, translated by W.S. Kuniczak. I spell this out because I believe the translation is of great importance. Kuniczak already cut his teeth with a splendid version of Sienkiewicz's "trilogy."I really ordered this book out of curiosity. "Quo Vadis" was the generally-accepted American view of Nero's Rome and the rise of Christianity when I was a boy: the mammoth film spectacle was released in 1951. Yet it seems pretty certain that the "narrative" presented by "Quo Vadis" --- "Christianity good, Roman paganism bad" --- is pretty much dead in the water (or, even worse, a laughingstock) by the early years of the 21st century. I was also curious to look at one of the very first global best-sellers: "Quo Vadis" was translated into 40 languages, and sold millions of copies.What surprised me was that reading just the first five or ten pages really hooked me. The book starts out as a passionate love story: the patrician pagan Vinicius, by all accounts a phenomenally handsome man who lives at the top of the pagan status-heap, is stricken by a fatal love-at-first-sight for a girl he does not even know. A few more pages, and canny readers will understand that the girl, Lygia, is a secret Christian --- and then you start wondering how all this is going to work out.Besides that, the novel's most memorable character is Petronius, who is master of the revels for the megalomaniac Nero. He is at first scornful of Vinicius's "total love" for Lygia, but he is a very intelligent (if cynical) man who is finally forced to admit that, in this case (as in others) Aphrodite and Eros are the supreme gods guiding human affairs.And then Sienkiewicz begins raising the question --- sometimes gently, and sometimes forcefully --- a question which boils down to "which side are you on?" Despite all of our sentimentality about "the grandeur of Rome," is it not finally self-evident that Rome had to be destroyed, and replaced? If you doubt that, then reflect on the massive amount of slavery, tyranny, sadism, and cruelty which was the daily fare in Rome. Even if you have only seen "Gladiator," you have a good idea of what the Romans considered to be a good show --- men and beasts slaughtering one another to entertain the masses. Sienkiewicz also provides good insights into pagan philosophy (mostly via Petronius).On the other side, you meet the secret and persecuted community of Christians, along with memorable portraits of St. Peter and St. Paul.In sum: I found this to be a fascinating and very well researched historical novel. Biased? Of course it's biased. Everyone who picks this book up will probably be biased as well. But biased towards which side? :-)If you are a fan of Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," this is probably a good volume to read at the same time.And it's a fascinating story.

This review applies to ISBN 0618517650The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition. I won't really comment on the novel itself, except to remember for a moment the intense hostility of academic English departments to this "trashy novel for children," "this [...] of good and evil." By now, the academy has come around, and they realize (as I did way before them) that "The Lord of the Rings" is going to stay in print for a much longer time than Joyce's "Ulysses" or Pound's "Cantos." Whether they like it or not. :-) And, of course, like it they should!I really want to review this edition of Tolkien's book, which serves him very well indeed. Finally bound in genuine leather, this book is a treat to hold and to own. And it's something to hand down to your children, which I'm afraid you can't do with digital books. As a former software engineer, let me just comment that paper is BY FAR the longest-lasting archival material, and that I have yet to see any digital format that does not eventually die out. If you put this book, this PAPER book, in your library, and don't mistreat it, it should last for centuries.Which is where I think book publishing is going: digital media for ephemera, with paper publishers forced into glorious editions of the classics.But, as Crick memorably commented, "How It Will All Turn Out Remains to be Seen." HIWATORTBS!! :-)In the meantime, enjoy this book.

"Notes from the Underground" is a brilliant satirical attack on "European ideas" as received in Russia, in general, and on one Nikolai Chernyshevsky in particular. It was strange, and hard to understand, so it was widely ignored until the 1920's, when someone finally began to notice that Dostoevsky had been RIGHT. Russians took the road of Chernyshevsky (an idiot, and a utopian socialist who denied human free will) and they wound up living the life of the Cockroach Man, where nobody was guilty of anything, and everybody was guilty of everything, and the blood flowed like water.It is important to understand that the narrator, the Cockroach Man, is not Dostoevsky, not even Dostoevsky on one of his bad days. He is definitely a literary creation, but what is he meant to represent? When people began taking this novel seriously, they imagined that the Cockroach Man ("I am a sick man...I am a wicked man...) was some lunatic opponent of Enlightened Ideas. But Dostoevsky was a step ahead of them, and it took a long time before people began to realize that the Cockroach Man was the direct result of taking Chernyshevsky's ideas seriously. In particular, the Cockroach Man's "hyperconsciousness" seems to serve as a code word for accepting man's lack of free will; this idea is something that philosophers bandy about easily, but they never seem to stop to think what it will mean if the human race takes them seriously. If that happens, "hyperconsciousness" comes into play, and ALL moral codes, ALL OF THEM, are erased. A man slaps you in the face!So what? He has no free will; he's just a robot. If you feel angry and slap him back, you're no better off. If you "decide" to ignore it with "compassion," it's the same thing: you are a robot as much as he is. No sin attaches to your actions or thoughts, but neither does any glory.To simplify and summarize: the Cockroach Man is Dostoevsky's acidic, sarcastic portrait of a man who takes Chernyshevsky (and his like) seriously.If man sees his own good and follows it automatically, why is history a non-stop affair of men slaughtering one another? Why do some men see the good path and deliberately take the evil path? If you rob mankind of his soul, his God, and his freedom, what kind of creature are you left with?"I am a sick man...I am a wicked man..."Highest recommendation!

I read this book when I was a freshman at St. John's College in Annapolis (yes, that's the "Great Books" college). So, while I was inhaling Homer, Plato, Aristotle and the rest, I was often to be found in the student union with this huge paperback written by Ayn Rand.I found the book to be enthralling, and in many ways it turned my view of the world completely upside-down. Just as interesting was the reaction of the other people who "caught me" reading this "awful book."The main "problem" with this book is that it attempts a complete destruction of the philosophical foundations of modern leftist thinking (and I am using the word "leftist" quite consciously, being a "liberal" myself --- in the original sense).I can illustrate one of the main ideas in this book with a homely anecdote concerning two different people I hired to work. One was dedicated, hard-working, and persistent; the other was lazy, incompetent, and a drunkard to boot. In my own estimation, the first man was worth a thousand a day, while the second was barely worth one or two hundred.The point where all the fighting usually starts is that some people think that paying the first person a thousand and the second person a hundred or two is ALREADY "economic justice." Some other people think that this is "unfair," and want to reach into the pocket of the hard-working man, remove some of his money, and give it to the lazybones. This represents something other than plain old "justice" and is generally called "social justice" or some such. It may even get dressed up as "robbing from the rich to give to the poor," because, just between you and me, "robbing from the workers and giving to the idle" would not attract many minds or many votes.This may be a political point, but "Atlas Shrugged" is a profoundly political book. I hear that new hires at the Cato Institute are referred to as "virgins" if they have not yet read "Atlas Shrugged."Another interesting fact is this: Ayn Rand was one of the most famous & independent women of the 20th century. She thought for herself --- and, come to think of it --- may be the most able female philosopher in history. But, to put it very mildly indeed, feminists do not like her. It's one of those strange things, like feminists not caring about the mutilation of Muslim girls in Africa.This is one of those books you really must read for yourself. It's a monument of the human intellect, and (strange?) it has reached #128 on the Amazon best-seller list as I write this review.-----Updated review------I just read another opinion that said: although Ayn Rand had a fine insight into the workings of economic systems, she basically didn't "get" how people work. I would agree to the extent that I find the dialogue between her "lovers" to be the worst things she ever wrote. (And I have NOT read it all! :-) )---- Review updated again------In the time since I posted my original review, it has become clear that the "anti-Rand" contingent basically regards her as a tool of the wealthy classes. This view is mistaken, and I can show you why with a simple example.If you look at our current economic mess, two things seem clear: tax revenues are falling because business is stagnant, whereas government spending is increasing because of current administration policy.Now, how could we get out of this mess? Imagine that a group of clever men create a new source of energy: let's call it "NewSteam." This new source of energy does not depend on fossil fuels and is a lot cheaper than fossil fuels as well. Imagine one step further: "NewSteam" relies on manipulating the force of gravity, and provides an energy source wherever there is a "NewSteam Engine," which costs $999.Almost overnight, a new industry starts to grow up around this original design, and it mushrooms. It is difficult to meet global demand. Revenues --- for all the companies in the "NewSteam" chain --- first quickly reach $100 billion, and then $1 trillion in the first three years. Within a decade or two, hundreds of thousands of Americans find good jobs in these industries. In the meantime, government tax revenues soar, and a huge amount of government spending becomes completely unnecessary --- for example, "Cap and Trade" is by now completely unnecessary. The government is happy because unemployment is way down, and taxes are flowing in -- not just from the corporations, but also from the employees of those corporations.And, needless to say, the original inventors become extremely wealthy men.I should point out, as an aside, that something very much like this did in fact happen in America, in the Silicon Valley, with the invention of the microprocessor and the personal computer.What Ayn Rand is pointing out is that these innovators are not evil men. They are the benefactors of mankind. Certainly the last thing Ayn Rand ever imagined herself as being was a "tool of the wealthy classes." She was trying to show us (a) the ways in which a society can become productive and wealthy (b) the ways in which a corrupt government can actually destroy the real path to wealth and personal fulfillment.If the "looter mentality" eventually rules America, the country is doomed. The personal computer industry will leave. The "NewSteam" industries will go elsewhere. In fact, I can stop here, and recommend that you read "Atlas Shrugged" for the full picture.----- review updated 2/3/11 ----------I have just had a new question about Ayn Rand pop into my mind.It occurs to me to ask, "Did she confuse the proper economic policy for a country with the proper way for a human being to live his life?"This arises from her producing such a weird essay as "The Virtue of Selfishness."You know, and I know, that this simply does not work in any known culture. Calling someone selfish is the same as calling him evil, or wicked. I will go further, and claim that selfishness will never, ever be regarded as a personal virtue among humankind.But, paradoxically, it IS the proper course for a business to pursue in a free market. A successful business may well contribute to charity, but in its main economic activity it must be relentlessly "selfish" and relentlessly competitive. This leads automagically to a dynamic free-market economy, where miracles occur on a daily basis --- where cell phones cost a thousand bucks fifteen years ago, and were laughably large, while nowadays they can cost as little as $25, and be lost in the cracks between sofa cushions.This probably means that people have to switch modes of thought between work and home, but that's not exactly news, is it?

As another reviewer pointed out, this long essay ("The Painted Word") can't really be called satire, simply because it contains no fiction. It is another demonstration of Tom Wolfe's unique ability to catch real people acting like buffoons and simply record what took place. The other outstanding example I can think of is "Radical Chic," which describes a fund-raising party hosted by Leonard Bernstein and his wife --- to raise money for the Black Panthers!There is a common denominator in these acid, hilarious portraits: the all-too-human desire to be "cooler," "more with-it" than your knuckle-dragging, ignorant fellow citizens. Such opportunities for making a fool of yourself go back to the mists of prehistory, or at least back to Moliere and "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme." I don't think Tom Wolfe ever got around to describing another person driven berserk by his desire to be "cool:" Norman Mailer and his support for the convicted murderer, who was released because of Mailer's pleading ("He's an artist!") --- and who went right out and killed again. I would guess that Wolfe thought about this project, but turned it down, refusing to get a laugh out of a real, live killing.Of course, Tom Wolfe does not "simply record" what took place, as I said above. On the contrary, he is a master of idiomatic English. Who else could write, of a frustrated Art Groupie, "but what ina namea Christ were we supposed to SEE?" That's a very sharp ear for American speech: a lesser talent would simply have written "in the name of Christ."The book does raise a few fears. Sometime in the radiant future, when the full foolishness of "The Painted Word" has been seen by everyone, a lot of Very Valuable Paintings are going to plummet in price. If you are heavily invested in Flatness and all that, you might consider "lightening your portfolio."

I believe that Sir Walter Scott was the man who invented the historical novel, and they say that this is one of his finest efforts. Certainly, it puts a lot of modern fiction into the shade, especially the sort of modern novel which amounts to prolonged gazing at one's own navel. (I haveThe Sense of an Ending (Borzoi Books)in mind...)But this is heresy! How can you possibly prefer clunky old Walter Scott (SO unfashionable!) to the winner of the Man Booker Prize (SO fashionable!). My only answer is that literary reputations come, and literary reputations go. Time was, when Sir Walter Scott was one of the best-read authors in history, but his reputation took a serious dive when "real writers" such as Ezra Pound and James Joyce came along.Nevertheless, "Quentin Durward" is very good reading. Not only is it a good story, you will actually gain some valuable knowledge about history, in particular the French king Louis XI, and the Duke of Burgundy.How about the style? Well, when I was in 8th grade I decided it was impenetrable, even yucky. But the decades passed (as they will) and now the style offers no impediment whatsoever.One very refreshing thing is that Quentin Durward is a Complete Pre-Feminist Male Hero. He is strong, valiant, a terrifying fighter, and extremely good-looking into the bargain. He respects women, and shows them every courtesy; in fact, at the end of the novel he almost surrenders his greatest love to rescue a Flemish girl who has been captured by a gang of soldiers with no good intentions. On top of that, he is nobly born, and expects that others treat him accordingly, mostly because he conducts himself according to a strict code of nobility.And all of these things are gone, gone with the wind -- if they ever really existed.I'm looking forward to reading more from this author, especially since you can get his complete works for the Kindle for almost nothing. :-)

This is a book Theosophists are bound to hate, but for me it is a wonderful exploration of a world which never quite owned up to the facts about itself.Of course, I have developed an allergy to "spiritual masters," from Koot Hoomi through Madame Blavatsky, Gurdjieff and the lot.Theosophists will hate this book, if only for its true recounting of the beginning of the career of Krishnamurti. He was in fact a very attractive Indian boy of 14 when the eyes of the "Reverend" Leadbeater fell on him -- Leadbeater being a great fan of young boys. So he was "adopted" and taken into "the faith" (with his brother, I think), and the good Reverend oversaw K.'s education up to the age of 20. Then, for some reason, the Rev split to Australia and K. broke with the Theosophical movement. "For some reason." Call for Sherlock Holmes!! What happened?I bet it had nothing to do with Hidden Masters or Koot Hoomi. :-)Highly recommended reading for evenings when you require a strong dose of The Higher Human Stupidity.

Other reviewers have noted two things which I will put briefly here: this book is extremely well-written and has unforgettable characters. More than that, the story is intriguing --- even enthralling.My personal favorite is the old man who opens the story with a magnificent 200-page portrait of everyone involved. Miss Clack is also memorable, and I am sure Wilkie Collins enjoyed every minute of skewering her through first-person narrative --- an endlessly hypocritical and pious spinster, who is also the "poor relation" of the family which the novel is about. It is especially delicious to witness Miss Clack telling off the heroine, Rachel --- who is an honest, beautiful young woman worth ten of Miss Clack. Miss Clack denounces Rachel (and everyone) as "heathen" and "pagan."Of course, this only scratches the surface. I haven't even mentioned Sergeant Cuff --- a memorable, honest, and intelligent character who has been the background model for many subsequent fictional detectives, including Sherlock Holmes.The only warning I have is this: if you have the Modern Library edition, you would be well-advised to skip the "learned" introduction by Carolyn Heilbrun, a tendentious and tedious piece worthy of Miss Clack herself.

"Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."But how can we know which things can be changed, and which things cannot?Read this book, and have your eyes opened! :-)

"The Last of the Wine" had a deep influence on my life. Recommended to me by a fine Spaniard in Amsterdam as "the best gay novel ever written," I naturally bought it at the first chance. I think it changed my life, a little bit. It brought home to me two facts I have been dealing with ever since.The first fact is that men can and do love one another. The problem with the word "homosexual" is that it manages to suggest that it's all about sex. For me, it's all about love. But many gay men have been damaged by their upbringing, and continue to insist that it's all about sex, because that's as far as they will go."The Last of the Wine" has its priorities right, in my view. There is no question that Alexias and Lysis have sex (off-camera), but the love between them is much more important.The second fact is that men can and do love both sexes. In modern America, the very idea is brushed off as "nonsense," and there is almost no dissent on this subject.Things were quite different in Ancient Greece, as this meticulously-researched and supremely well-written novel points out. And, if we are so different from the men in Ancient Greece, well: would that be a matter of cultural programming, or a matter of biology?Read "The Last of the Wine" and wonder about these questions! :-) Or not. The most important thing is to read it. It really is a masterpiece!

Even though I fancy myself a semi-alert follower of global news, this book took me completely by surprise. Here's the short version of the surprise: there may be as many as 100 million Christians in China. (Does that mean there are more Christians in China than in Europe??)The long version of the surprise is WHY. And the answer comes from the Chinese intelligentsia, in the person of one "Dr. Wu" (not his real name)."One of the things we were asked to look into was what accounted for the success, in fact the pre-eminence of the West all over the world. We studied everything we could from the historical, political, economic, and cultural perspective."At first, we thought it was because you had more powerful guns than we had. Then we thought it was because you had the best political system. Next we focused on your economic system."But in the past twenty years, we have realized that the heart of your culture is your religion: Christianity. That is why the West has been so powerful. The Christian foundation of social and cultural life was what made possible the emergence of capitalism and then the successful transition to democratic politics. We don't have any doubt about this."So said Dr. Wu, in a statement which is beginning to be heard around the world. Chinese society has an aching gap where "Mao Thought" used to be. Nobody believes in Marxism, Leninism, or Maoism any more. Confucius is respected, but regarded as a bit behind the times, and unfamiliar with global competition. So what is going to fill that gap?Well, there are 100 million Chinese Christians, and I don't think they spend much time listening to our village atheists.This book was a complete surprise for me, a stunning surprise.-----UPDATE-----China is now the world's largest producer of Bibles: 100 million.

This short novel has taught me something interesting. It is possible for a supremely skilled writer to structure his fiction like a symphony. He can bring in the theme of "darkness" at the very beginning, and then let it lapse for a while as Marlowe makes his way down the African coast --- but with the theme recurring as various disconcerting facts are noted. This is the way a master symphonist works, with various themes intertwined, until the finale which ends the performance, with Darkness Visible and All-Pervading.This is an aspect of "style" (or "art") which none of my English teachers were smart enough to mention, perhaps because they were so taken with "critical theory" that they failed to understand the supreme work of art right under their noses.You don't have to be an aspiring writer to appreciate this superb novella --- one of the best things I have ever read."Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn't touched. I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of somber pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror--of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision,--he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath--"'The horror! The horror!'"

As others have noted, this is the tale of a spoiled rich brat, who has the very good luck to fall off a luxury ocean-liner at sea, and be introduced to the Real World of hard work, earned money, and self-respect which is deserved.Rudyard Kipling once again shows himself to be a master story-teller, and the story of the friendship that grows between the Portuguese fisherman, Manuel, and the former brat, Harvey Cheyne, is memorable.If you like this book, be sure to see the classic movie made from it, with Spencer Tracy as Manuel.

I do not usually appreciate "self-help" books, but the points made in "The Richest Man in Babylon" seem to be mostly just common sense. Unfortunately, most people completely lack common sense about money.One of the main ideas that most people never seem to get is that it is better, and more interesting, to make money from your MONEY than to make money breaking your back. However, this leads us to the first difficulty: in order to make money from your money, you have to have some.As we supposedly "all know," we cannot have our cake and eat it, too. But most people spend every penny in their paychecks, and then some run out and charge more on their credit cards. They live from hand to mouth, from paycheck to paycheck, and they never even dream of actually saving 10 percent (or more) of what they earn.But how can you have money if you don't have any money? Let us imagine some typical American, earning (say) $40K per year. Saving 10 percent of his salary would give him "only" $4,000 in the bank at the end of one year. This looks pretty miserable, until you stop to wonder just how many people could actually lay their hands on $4,000 in cash WITHOUT doing a cash-advance on their credit cards. By the end of the fifth year, this fictional person would have $20,000 in the bank, assuming no interest and no investment income.But now this person is in a position to actually begin making investments, and watch his money work for him. And the profits from that should just be plowed right back into "the money tree."My personal opinion: if you think there is another way to "financial freedom," you are simply deluding yourself. Win the lottery? Gee, how many rich people do you know who got their start that way?Answer: none. Lottery winners usually run out and spend their winnings faster than they come in. Consider winning "a million dollars" in some phony lottery which does not actually hand you a million dollars, but doles you out $50,000 per year over 20 years. Most people turn this into a sort of middle-class welfare, and wind up as broke as they ever were. But, if you did NOT quit your job, and put that money in the bank, faithfully, over a 20-year-period, you would (after investing it) have a whole lot more than a million dollars.The author of this book was clever: he set it in ancient Babylon. The point was that reality, in many important respects, does not change.I would agree with all that there are many ways to be wealthy: in learning, in money, in love, in friends, and so on. But it is very difficult to attain those other happinesses if you can't make the rent.This is actually a good book. It has never gone out of print, and that may mean something.

The only serious criticism I have of this novel is that it starts a bit slowly, with the London literary scene and boring dinner parties.But when the lightning strikes ("Charles Strickland has abandoned his wife and children!"), the story suddenly becomes much more interesting, especially because Strickland has been seen and portrayed as the Ultimately Dull English stockbroker.When Strickland chucks it all and goes to Paris, everyone assumes that he has a new girl-friend. In fact, other characters make up the details: "He's staying in the best Parisian hotels with his chippie, and dining at the finest restaurants," etc. etc. and so forth.When the young narrator is sent to Paris to try and bring Strickland back, we quickly discover that this is all nonsense. There is no chippie, and Strickland is staying in a very cheap fleabag hotel. When he is asked "Why?" he only gives one answer, "I have to paint."Maugham thus offers a portrait of man enslaved by his Muse, who quite literally does not give a pin for the opinion of others. He is also the most selfish of men, a genuine sociopath in the modern jargon, who is perhaps best captured in the following exchange:Narrator: Well, I must tell you that I find you the most hateful cad I have ever known.Strickland: I'm glad you got that off your chest. Shall we have dinner now?As you may be able to gather from the above, Strickland cares about his painting and about NOTHING ELSE. He can live in a flophouse, wearing the same clothes for five years, and be totally indifferent to all that. Money means nothing to him. Food and drink mean nothing.Well, I won't spoil it for you, but I would offer a warning to young wannabe artists: please do not emulate Charles Strickland's behavior because you think it makes you more "artistic." That would really be a case of putting the cart before the horse.Is Strickland Gauguin? In a sense. I suspect that the case of Gauguin got Maugham to thinking, and making notes. But in the end, Strickland and his story wound up being entirely original.

The fascinating and prolific historian Paul Johnson opined that Bertrand Russell (whom he didn't much like) had written a superb history of Western philosophy --- so good that it could not be outdone, and therefore earned himself a lot of envious enemies.

If you ever get in a mood where you're suspecting that philosophy rots the brain, take a break and dip into this wonderful book.Others have noted that Lucian influenced Erasmus. I would reply, "Not enough!" I have never been able to read more than two pages of the supposedly hilarious "In Praise of Folly," but I can read anything and everything by Lucian, including his great satire, "Philosophies For Sale," where Zeus tries to raise a little cash by auctioning off philosophers, beginning with "that long-haired guy over there," Pythagoras. His little dialogue, "Timon," has volumes to say about Wealth, and says it all in about fifteen pages.Lucian loves to poke fun at Socrates, as well, openly doubting the "purity" of Socrates' love for handsome young men."Alexander the Quack Prophet" may be Lucian's best piece. It's based upon a real person who lived at the same time as Lucian. I think the most memorable character is one Rutilianus, who is a mature, sensible Roman who has served Rome well in many important functions, but has a serious screw loose when it comes to religious gullibility. The satire is really deadly, especially if you have ever known someone who fits "the Rutilianus Profile." :-)It's fun reading, but, like most satire, it's making some serious points during all the fun.

I don't want to spoil anything, but the zany title of the book ("Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames") more or less gives the game away. In French, it's meaningless: "Mots d'Heures" would be the "Words of the Hours" or something like that, while I believe that "rames" are oars. The key thing is that if you read it aloud, with the right accent and proper pauses, it says "Mother Goose Rhymes" (or "Moder Goose Rame"). Inside is more of the same, accompanied by a very funny "critical apparatus."Just one warning: enjoy the book but don't get into it TOO seriously! :-) Otherwise, you might be tempted to do the same thing in reverse, and discover just how hard this game is to play! "A lawn's on font, Dell up a tree! Leisure-dug Loire ate Harry Vay!" :-)ONLY for linguistic basket cases, and people who enjoy a good laugh!

I was reading through Pope Benedict's first book on Jesus,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration, and I began to feel a little bit wobbly --- out of my depth, so to speak.So I "retreated" to this book, and found it even more compelling. For one thing, Benedict's first item for discussion is DOUBT, something which applies in roughly equal measures to believers and non-believers, although you will never find Richard Dawkins admitting to such a thing. "Yet, perhaps it is true..." is the thought echoing in the minds of some atheists.This is followed by a penetrating argument which actually startled me, because I had just written something similar in an Amazon review a few days before. What I said was that scientists who refused to discuss Intelligent Design because "it was not science" may have walled themselves off from the truth. What Benedict wrote was much more sweeping: because positivist science deals only with the visible and the material, it CANNOT discover the truth, because the most important things in human life are invisible.Now, think about that for a few moments: "the most important things in life are invisible."That would, of course, include your soul, and God as well. If God is the root of all the meaning in life, well, science cannot possibly discover this, because they have ruled him out of the game by manipulating the rules!There are other "invisible" things which rule our lives; the most important is love. There are many ways to make love manifest on the physical level (flowers, kisses, etc.) but love itself cannot be touched or seen.Of course, I can think of a lot more things which make philosophical materialists ill at ease: information, ideas, music, poetry...the list is really quite long, and philosophical materialists who try to reduce these things to the billiard-ball view of the universe really go through quite remarkable contortions trying to do this. On the other hand, if we admit the existence of non-material things, the problems disappear."What is belief really? We can now reply like this: It is a human way of taking up a stand in the totality of reality, a way that cannot be reduced to knowledge and is incommensurable with knowledge; it is the bestowal of meaning without which the totality of man would remain homeless, on which man's calculations and actions are based, and without which in the last resort he could not calculate and act, because he can only do this in the context of a meaning that bears him up. For in fact man does not live on the bread of practicability alone; he lives as man and, precisely in the intrinsically human part of his being, on the word, on love, on meaning."In any case, if you are curious about Christianity, this is a superb book. And it puts some of the efforts of C.S. Lewis in the shade.Very high recommendation!

While I agree with some other reviewers that this book's discussion of Asian countries is not profound, one really could hardly expect otherwise (because Western scholarship is just beginning to deal with Asia and its sexual attitudes) --- and one looks in vain for a book which does a better job.In its areas of strength (Christendom) the book is simply unrivaled --- there is no significant competition. If you want more detail, you will have to go to Wayne R. Dynes' "Encyclopedia of Homosexuality."Frankly, this is a masterpiece. If you have any interest at all in the subject of sex (and who doesn't?) -- it belongs in your library.

When I bought this book, I imagined it would begin with the discoveries of Mr. Hubble, but I was wrong again!In fact, this book is a history of the entire science of cosmology, and so it begins with tribal myths, and the first struggles of the pre-Socratics --- and then on to the bean-eater, Pythagoras! (Actually, I'm not sure right now, whether Pythagoras required the eating of beans, or forbade it. Religious nuttery, in either case.)Since I've just been reading William Dunham'sJourney through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics, I was a little surprised to be encountering the same cast of characters all over again, but let me say that Singh's account is much, much better for the general reader. Dunham has no problem covering 2-3 pages with calculus formulas, and Singh wouldn't dream of doing such a thing. Nevertheless, for the very first time in my life, I have a clear understanding of how the Copernican Revolution occurred. I used to have a mish-mash of Tyco Brahe, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo which was not clearly understood. but Simon Singh explained it to me. In brief: Copernicus was the first to revive the thoughts of an ancient Greek "heretic" who believed in a sun-centered universe. But Copernicus wrote very badly, and his book was sabotaged at the printers literally as Copernicus lay dying. Enter, stage left, Tyco Brahe, an eccentric nobleman who made the most exact astronomical observations in history, and drank too much. (He also had a metal nose...) The humble Lutheran "peasant" Kepler was the man who did all the hard math work, using Brahe's observations and Copernicus's theory, and he published the definitive work which explained that the planets did NOT have circular orbits, but elliptical orbits --- an idea which made "Aristotelians" foam at the mouth. Finally, enter Galileo (stage right) bearing a weapon of great power --- the telescope. The telescope eventually proved Kepler right in just about every detail.This is a very enjoyable and educational book, which reminds me of that great TV series, "Connections." Very highly recommended!

I read a biography of Evelyn Waugh years ago, and one fact sticks with me: he was a devout Catholic.This provides his satiric viewpoint on the society and people he found around him. In "Decline and Fall," virtually everyone except the non-hero Paul Pennyfeather is viewed and portrayed with an acid tongue. Waugh may have been a devout Christian, but his interpretation of the command to love your enemies certainly moved him to what might be delicately called Tough Love.Add to his hilarious deadpan satire, his uncommon gift for language, and you're set for a very puzzling and enjoyable read. The only thing which makes it drag is that everyone in the book, absolutely everyone, is portrayed as a failure, a crook, or an agent of moral evil. (Except for Paul Pennyfeather, who has no personality at all.) I could detail all the sins committed by the major characters, but that would be giving the plot away.All in all, I guess I prefer P. G. Wodehouse. :-) Although I wouldn't like to live without "Brideshead Revisited."

"The Revolt of the Masses" has been, I think, continuously in print since 1930 for the simple reason that it's a very important book. Its main observation is hardly possible to deny: the vast increase in wealth caused by the Industrial Revolution empowered whole massive segments of society which had formerly been nearly invisible. And they all wanted to go to the beach and stay in hotels and eat in restaurants. So, way back in 1930, Ortega y Gasset was already noticing that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a place on the beach, or a room in a hotel, or a table in a restaurant. "Mass man" had arrived.This book also contains a lot of commentary on the nature of mass man. For example: "the commonplace mind, knowing itself to be commonplace, has the assurance to proclaim the rights of the commonplace and to impose them wherever it will." In the 21st century, where "The Simpsons" are vastly popular, and it is suddenly fashionable to deny the very idea that a man should want to be a gentleman, the words ring true.What is more interesting, perhaps, is to speculate on how the newly-arrived "mass man" went about the pursuit of political power. But that would be another book entirely.This book, along with other fundamental books like "Human Action," should be a part of every thinking person's education. Of course, right now it's NOT, but I think we all have a pretty good idea why not.Highest possible recommendation!

(This is a review ofIn Search of Lost Time, Volume 1: Swann's Way, the Modern Library hardback edition.)I notice the reviewer who claims that this is great reading for middle-aged people. Well, I have a friend whose mother says that you must wait until you are 70 before reading this novel.All I can say is that I read it in college and learned one extremely important lesson from it: "social climbing is a complete waste of time." This was an important thing to learn while I was still young, and I'm glad I didn't wait until the age of 40 or 70 to appreciate it.And the lesson comes from someone who spent a few years in social climbing. He may have concluded that it was all a waste of time ("lost time" in a different sense), but what a story he made of it!I don't quite understand all the people who are "afraid" of this enormous novel. I suggest: pick up the first volume and give it a read. Nobody is holding a gun to your head. If you don't like it, that's fine. But you should be aware that, in the first two volumes, Proust is really just warming up his orchestra and playing a grand overture. ("How the $%^&# could some nutter Frenchman spend more than 1,000 pages on a freeping OVERTURE?" Well, part of the answer is that it is an extremely well-written and thought-provoking overture. But, if you get to Volume III, be prepared for the greatest social comedy ever written. Madame Verdurin and the Baron de Charlus step forward in full character, as well as Francoise, all of them giants of world literature.)Even in this first volume of the "overture," there is a complete novella called "Swann in Love." It will make you familiar with the main Proustian obsession, which is jealousy, and prepare you for the later "Variations on a Theme" which follow.By the way, the first 30 pages or so are about trying to go to sleep, and waiting for his Mama's good-night kiss...

This is another great Travis McGee adventure, made memorable by the large and vivid cast of characters...perhaps I should say the large and vivid cast of villains, who may even disturb your sleep.The adventure begins with a man who suffers incredible bad luck: his wife dies, and then his beloved teenage daughter dies in Mexico. More than that, he winds up in a car wreck and loses the use of his legs. Insurance money pours in -- which he has no use for -- so he hires McGee to find out what happened to his daughter, last seen heading off for a pleasure jaunt through Mexico. All the threads lead to Oaxaca, where McGee and and his enormously interesting friend Meyer begin digging.There are, as always, too many unexplained threads to the story. By the time all the threads are gathered together, you will have learned a great deal about human evil.Very highly recommended!

Although I have only finished the first three chapters of this book, I still want to give it a rave review, at the same time as I wonder why I was never exposed to it, at any time during my American education. I read plenty of books by liberals, but somehow this brilliant work by Russell Kirk was regarded as something like the deadly nightshade.Not so! And I will repeat the same complaint again: after reading the chapter on Edmund Burke, I wonder again why no teacher, and no course, ever even *mentioned* Edmund Burke, certainly one of the most profound thinkers of the last five centuries.And this book acquires even more importance when put with Melanie Phillip'sThe World Turned Upside Down: The Global Battle over God, Truth, and Power, because I suspect that she has not read it. She should read it, because some solutions to her problems appear in these profound pages.As Kirk summarizes Burke: the moral order among men is only a reflection of the moral order of God. Governments are instituted among men primarily to provide for safety --- safety from the marauding Saracen without our borders, and safety from the mob within our own borders. From this, Burke deduces his own, extremely interesting list of the rights of man, which to my mind rivals the list of natural rights listed in the Founding Documents of America. "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness" -- yes! But Burke adds: freedom to participate in an ordered, organized and intelligent society [not his words, I paraphrase].After trying to summarize Burke, Kirk turns to the equally difficult task of trying to summarize John Adams, until recently our most-overlooked Founding Father. This "dour Federalist" is most likely the man responsible for our Federalist system of government, with its three branches (legislative, executive, and judicial). He accomplished this by "simply" writing an immense three-volume lawyer's brief, which surveyed and examined an immense range of successful governments:A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America Against Attack of M. Turgot in His Letter to Dr. Price, Dated the Twenty-Second Day of March, 1778. Fortunately, David McCullough has been resurrecting the life and career of this brilliant man, John Adams --- and the life of John Adams is now available on DVD:John Adams (HBO Miniseries).There are lots of books on the market "explaining" liberalism, which usually teach such dubious doctrines as the Perfectibility of Man (Condorcet) and the Natural Equality of All Men. For the Conservative side, Russell Kirk's book is the heavyweight champion.On the negative side, Kirk strikes me as much too fond of religion and much too critical of economic progress. If we were to take him at his word, we would wind up with a much poorer America absolutely devoted to the Virgin Mary. If Kirk understands that a strong economy can pay for a strong military, he doesn't say so. Myself, I'm pretty comfortable with a strong and free America, with enough money to go around for everyone.If you want to have a balanced and informed view of the 21st-century political debate, this is a book which you must take into account.

This book makes a good companion to Ortega y Gasset'sThe Revolt of the Masses.The earlier book, by Ortega y Gasset, describes the rise of "mass man" during the late 19th and early 20th century. Suddenly, large swarms of humans who had been "anonymous" became wealthier, and demanded a seat at the table -- or a place at the beach. Restaurants and beaches became crowded.We may note in passing that this real historical development -- the rise of mass man through increasing wealth -- is just one more thing which makes Karl Marx look like an idiot. Marx famously predicted that the increasing impoverishment of mass-man would lead to a revolution.But Ortega y Gasset missed reporting on one thing which ordinary readers will be curious about: what happens when mass-man accedes to political power? Ortega y Gasset has a few notes, but he missed the main shows.To be brief: the rise of mass-man led to the rise of new political parties, generally dedicated to taking the property of the wealthy and giving it to mass-man. The most well-known forms of this are, of course, Socialism and Communism. To be a "leftist," after all, means mostly that: "reducing inequality" by soaking the rich. It's been a long time since I heard any "leftist" calling for more freedom, or for "classical liberal values."Now, to get to the book under review: it is as clear as anything in history that Mussolini was "a man of the left." He was more than that: he was a dedicated Socialist. Hitler was more complex, racist, and opportunistic, but he nevertheless rode to power on the back of his "national socialist" movement. Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot need no commentary from me. So the hair-raising conclusion is just this:Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot were ALL "men of the left." This is just plain historical fact.But it's giving people the apoplexy to have this truth rubbed in. I am a boomer, and grew up learning that "Fascism" was just awful, while being "Progressive" was like -- (reaching for the slang) -- just like really cool, man.And now we have to re-think everything! Fascism and Communism were BOTH movements of the left. To return to my beginning point, the rise of mass-man to political power led to extraordinary cruelty, stupidity, and mass murder.But, as they say, "let the dialog begin."

This is a delightful story based on a wonderful concept. My only complaint was that, at times, the novel seemed to have some "padding" --- place descriptions perhaps based on some travel book, subplots which didn't ring quite true, and so forth. The Indian raid on the train struck me as the least plausible.But why quibble? The world loved this book, and still does. And if you love the book, you might want to seek out the magnificent movie made from this story:Around the World in 80 Days (Two-Disc Special Edition). Excellent acting, good fun all around, and Cantinflas steals the show as Passepartout.

I am a big fan of Paul Johnson, and sometimes I stand in awe of what he has accomplished as a historian and author: "Modern Times," "The Birth of the Modern," excellent histories of Judaism and Christianity, "Intellectuals" --- well, the man just never stops producing interesting stuff to read, including his recent "Creators."This book is about his conservative Catholic faith, and I found the portrait of that beguiling and comforting, right up to his chapter on "The Last Judgment." It seemed to me that his reason deserted him there, since a God who would send his own creatures to everlasting torment does not even meet the ethical standards of the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). What would we say about a man who chose to breed Golden Retrievers, and chose to say "Bad dog!" by crucifying the dog upside down over an eternally burning fire? How much more damning would our ethical judgment be, if the man were not raising Golden Retrievers, but was raising creatures which were his own creation?I suspect this is why the Church of England has dropped the very concept of Hell. Interestingly enough, since the COE is an established religion, this dogma was forced down the throats of COE priests by a council of laymen.For this and similar reasons, I cannot recommend this book. At all.

"The Summing Up" is not a novel, and it's not really an autobiography, either. It is just what the title says, a book doing the job a lawyer does, when he "sums up" a case before sending it off to the jury for a verdict. The evidence is examined, witnesses are dissected, and finally the attorney states his view of the case.But Maugham is not summing up a case, he's summing up his life. As he says, there are a number of issues he has been working on for years, and he wants to set them down while he still has time. (As it turned out, he had lots of time!)One of the first, and most interesting discussions, is "how to write good English prose." You would imagine that any author worth his salt has opinions on this, but Maugham offers a veritable graduate seminar. Is an entire lifetime long enough to really master the task? He examines Swift, Dryden, Dr. Johnson, and a myriad of other classic writers, and finally sums up his own goals in writing English. In order, they are clarity (lucidity), simplicity, and euphony. That it to say, Goal One is to express your meaning clearly, and then make sure that it is as simple as possible. Third, make it sound well on the ear.Another long and interesting discussion concerns drama and the theater. You'll learn a lot from this "master dramatist's" long reflection and learning. In fact, his plays made his fortune --- he earned enough to return to the writing of fiction (he was actually sick of the theater) and began making a whole new reputation as a master of the short story. Naturally, he provides a long discussion of the various ways to write a story, and finally settles himself firmly in the camp of the ancient storyteller, who held his audience spellbound around a roaring fire.Quite a bit of Maugham's life story does leak into "The Summing Up." Both Maugham and Chekhov are instances of a rather common pattern: doctors who write. This pattern includes a lot of people, most recently Theodore Dalrymple.To sum up :-) ---- this is a fascinating book, one of Maugham's best, and very highly recommended.

Opinions differ, with regard to Alexander Pope, but then again it's hard to find any subject at all where opinions do NOT differ!I think that Pope was one of the most clever and skilled man who ever wrote verse in English, and that his verse rises pretty frequently to the level of poetry. His translation of "The Iliad" is probably immortal. I was surprised to learn that he farmed out the translation of "The Odyssey" to lesser lights: half of the books in the "Pope" translation of "The Odyssey" were, in fact, ghost-written!If you have never read anything by Pope and want an introduction, then find yourself an easy chair, pour yourself something cordial to drink, and read the "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot." I never get tired of this minor masterpiece! ("Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?" is just one example. But I could cite the whole thing!)Highest recommendation!

This English-Thai dictionary is so good that it was snapped up (probably before publication) by Besta, the company that makes electronic dictionaries in Thailand. (It's in their top-of-the-line Cyber Dict 10 Advance.) Therefore I don't consult the printed version very often -- although it's always nice to have the original book for serious inquiries. There isn't a better English-Thai dictionary on the market, believe me. If you get the electronic version, the feature wanted by the previous reader pretty much appears by magic. Just use the stylus to highlight a Thai word, and press F1. You'll see a reverse definition (from Thai to English) with a transliteration of the Thai just beneath the Thai word. You can also get lucky and find the word via the 11-language dictionary, and have the machine actually pronounce the word for you.I wish Besta or someone else would grant my wish though, and use the Damnern-Sathienpong Thai-English dictionary for the other way, and then put in the Royal Academy's Thai-Thai dictionary (the "Rachabanditiyya-sathaan"). Throw in the shorter two-volume OED for English-English and you have exactly the books sitting on my desk. :-)The only negative note I have is that (as you can probably imagine) the printed book does not exactly slip into your pocket. But when you're travelling, you can take the Besta machine and one of the small, inexpensive Thai-English dictionaries. Not really a problem!My congratulations to everyone involved in this stupendous achievement!

I would echo the thoughts of "meadowreader:" this volume is mostly about Kant, who is considered one of the most difficult of all philosophers. The contents of Volume VI include an overview of the French Enlightenment, two chapters on the madman Rousseau, an overview of the German Enlightenment, and then on to pp. 182-392, which are devoted to Immanuel Kant.With each new volume, my admiration for the stunning achievement of Father Copleston increases. He makes it possible to at least somewhat enjoy and understand the individual philosophers as individuals, but it also becomes clearer and clearer that the serious student needs to go back to page 1 of volume 1 and begin reading with full attention, probably taking notes along the way!However, this volume by itself is a real treat for unfortunates like myself who have never understood what Kant was up to. At the very least, in simplistic terms, Kant was trying to reconcile the obvious facts about the universe uncovered by Newton with the dogmatic "we-can-know-nothing-about-the-world" attitude of David Hume. Clearly, Kant thought, Hume had missed the trail somewhere: the burning question was "Where?"So the intellectual detective story continues!

According to my Thai translation of "The Little Prince," this book has been translated into 140 languages and has sold 50 million copies. However, as the little prince himself might be the first to note, that's just the way grown-ups think: they are only interested in numbers. :-)This is an enchanting story, with a completely improbable cast of characters: a French aviator downed in the Sahara, a little prince who comes from a tiny kingdom on another world, the rose he loves, three tiny volcanoes -- all, hopefully, extinct --- a fox, and a poisonous snake. Oh, yes, there's a sheep as well, and a glass cover to protect the rose, and a muzzle to keep the sheep from eating the rose. The last three only exist as drawings which the aviator makes for the little prince.Sometimes I think that any artist who creates a masterpiece tends to tear up the rulebook and start afresh. Don't misunderstand me: tearing up the rulebook is not enough, in and of itself. It is also necessary to have something vivid and important to say. Saint-Exupery wrote his masterpiece in the form of a book for children, but it is surely not a "book for children" any more than "The Lord of the Rings" is. It is a charming book, which will very likely move you to laughter and tears --- and perhaps both at the same time.As for choosing an English translation, this strikes me as a molehill which a number have people have been trying to turn into a mountain. Here, you decide:------------------------------------------------"On ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux."Woods: ""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."Howard: "One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes."--------------------------------------------------------------------The French is not all that difficult. "One only sees well with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes." You might think that "invisible to the eyes" is pleonastic, but it has to contrast to the "seeing" which is done with the heart. If you want to fight over "bien" == well, rightly, clearly -- or "l'essential" == the essential, what is essential, anything essential --- well, I won't take part in that fight.Much more important than the translation: the book!! It's a great one, and it does not grow old!!My favorite: "How to Tame a Fox."

I hate to say that this was one of my favorite films when I was in my twenties.Now. with much more experience under my belt, I listen to Zorba's answer about whether he has ever been married, which is (from memory), "Yes, wife, house, kids, the full catastrophe!" And my older & wiser self automatically raises two questions: (1) Most people consider a wife and family to be the best of good fortune, and (2) Where are these people, now that you have obviously abandoned them, to become a Life Force of the Greek Peasantry?The rest of this movie is no better, and goes straight downhill when the Life Force of the Greek Peasantry begins having affairs with women.It retains some small interest as one more attempt to justify the idea that "I am free to do whatever I want whenever I want," a thought that is absurd even in Calvin & Hobbes cartoons.

It's a little surprising to realize that "The Karate Kid" is now 24 years old. Made in 1984, it still holds its own in 2008. In fact, it's a LOT better than many of the movies being churned out today.Why? For me, it's simply the excellent acting. Somehow, the chemistry between "Daniel-san" and "Mister Miyagi" is excellent, and memorable. Without this, the movie would have been forgotten decades ago."Daniel's" mother also does an excellent job, deftly managing to portray a total airhead without so much as a hint that anything is wrong. (What DID happen to Daniel's father, anyway?)To my mind (and time will tell) this re-make of "Rocky" is, oddly enough, a lot better than the original! That doesn't happen very often!A very high recommendation, especially if you are getting tired of films full of nothing but explosions.

A lot of these books about getting rich (or at least getting richer) repeat the same ideas, over and over again.1. Save part of your income and invest it.2. Make the decision: do you actually want to BE rich, or do you just want to LOOK rich? If it's the former, do NOT buy that Mercedes-Benz; keep your old Honda for another ten years and put the car payments in the bank.3. Do the job which best suits your abilities.4. If you have something good to offer, tell people. Advertise.5. Honesty and respect for the customer are always the best policies.In American folklore, P. T. Barnum has become something of a legendary hoaxster --- and nothing could be farther from the truth. He provided genuine entertainment, and got rich doing it. In a way, he was the Walt Disney of his time. If you want to glimpse his real character, read this book. It's short, sweet, and to the point.

I had an interesting experience recently. I lent two books to a friend, this book and the hard-to-findAn Account Of The Remarkable Occurrences In The Life And Travels Of Col. James Smith During His Captivity With The Indians In The Years 1755-1759. Both books are highly factual AND very incorrect, according to the PC crowd.The book by James Smith is one of the most thrilling tales of the frontier ever written. It begins when he is riding down a trail with a friend, and shots ring out from an Indian ambush. His horse rears and throws him in terror, and when he comes to his dead friend is being scalped by the Indians.Scalped. Do we still remember that word, in modern times, when we fuzzily imagine that the Indians represented Rousseau's "noble savage" (but with scalping!)? Have we forgotten that the Iroquois burned their captives alive, or have we fallen comfortably back on the illusion that life with the Indians was allHanta Yo: An American Sagawith all of the evil coming from the corrupt, murderous Europeans?This book is a wonderful tonic, and reminder of the way things were, when the "genocidal white man" was often fighting defense.Anyhow, my friend finished the Smith book and then picked up "Out Of America." About two-thirds of the way through, he called me to comment that the behavior of the Africans in that book made the Indians look like polite Boston matrons at a tea party. And the atrocious behavior of the Africans can't be blamed on bad leadership or colonial corruption: if you take a look at Stanley'sIn Darkest Africa: Or, the Quest, Rescue, and Retreat of Emin Governor of Equatoria, with Two Steel Engravings, 150 Illustrations and Maps, or perhaps the exciting new biographyStanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorerof the man we call "Stanley," it becomes clear as glass that things were even worse in the 19th century.However, this is another example of Thoughtcrime. I have a friend who has never been to any part of Africa who periodically assures me that things in sub-Saharan Africa are looking up, and the subcontinent is almost entirely democratic "by now" or will be "quite soon."I would suggest reading this book and deciding for yourself. Just an idea!

Stephen Covey's book is based on his philosophy. Most people hate the word and the idea, and it's hard to blame them, because professional philosophers became incoherent a long time ago. But, as they say, even people who don't think they have a philosophy have one in fact.Ayn Rand's book, "Atlas Shrugged," is trying to become a best-seller nowadays. And she is a philosopher who does not deny the fact.What drew me to compare them is that they are in "absolute agreement" about one phase of character development:DEPENDENCE --> INDEPENDENCETime after time, Rand and Covey echo one another. When Covey writes of being "pro-active" (or "inner-directed"), Rand may be a little more precise in calling man a creature of volitional consciousness. But the idea is the same: we are NOT "determined" by genetics, or upbringing, or the environment. Between "stimulus" and "response" lies the human mind.What I found a bit more interesting is where Covey and Rand part ways, apparently. Covey's model is:DEPENDENCE --> INDEPENDENCE --> INTERDEPENDENCEwhere it must be clearly understood that "interdependent" relationships are not parasitical. Ayn Rand can't go there. She gets stuck on "INDEPENDENCE" and winds up with a model where Everyman Is An Island. This might be why she seems to be incapable of describing everyday things like a happy marriage with children. Children are by their very nature dependent, and Ayn Rand apparently does not want to go there, any more than she wants to talk about equal partnerships.The successful businessmen that I know all realize the immense value of joining forces and cooperation.But that word "cooperation" takes us back to the basic conflict in all of human society: we cooperate AND we compete. How we manage to do both at the same time is a matter of a delicate balance.

I have previously caught flack on Amazon for highly negative reviews of the Baron d'Holbach, who asserted that there is no God, man has no soul or free will, and that the only thing in the universe is a gigantic clockwork.De La Mettrie is right there as well. His "Man a Machine" might just as well be called a "meat machine," having no free will -- and no importance. If you are looking for a human being who has been endowed by his Creator with certain inalienable rights, this is not the place to look.De La Mettrie advised that life was totally meaningless, and therefore the only way to live was unbridled hedonism. Not too far from the Marquis de Sade.There are of course enormous holes in this amateur "philosophy." For one thing, as Dr. Johnson memorably pointed out, "Our will is free, and there's an end on't." Another huge gap comes in the domain of music. As Celibidache memorably pointed out, "There must be a correspondence between the sounds and our inner cosmos, or music would not work." De La Mettrie (and D'Holbach) would probably scream, "What inner cosmos?"But I think you and I know about the interior world, with so many parts: not just brain but heart, sympathy, reverence, loyalty. Where this human soul came from remains a very profound mystery.

While reading this novel for the first time, I felt as though I had regressed to the mental state of a very young child. That child, being tucked into bed, eagerly requests the same story he has heard a hundred times before, and Daddy or Mommy patiently complies with the 101st reading.That is to say: almost everyone reading this book is totally familiar with the plot, because they have watched the classic Bogart movie.The novel is well-written, and makes amazing use of American English idioms. But why is it so fascinating?One thought occurred to me: if you take that precious falcon away and substitute (say) a suitcase with a million dollars in it, an awful lot of the story's charm vanishes. Is it really interesting to watch people chasing after a suitcase filled with everyday money?I don't think so, and this is one of the things that really makes the story work. The story of the Maltese Falcon is almost impossibly romantic, and it makes an excellent counterpoint to the brutal realism of the rest of the novel. In a strange way, it dignifies the money-grubbing cockroaches who desire to possess it. Their absolute failure may even constitute a moral for the novel.This is a great story, and it will be around for a long time. If Hollywood produced a movie as good as this nowadays, the shock might kill me. :-)

The very improbable duo of the little boy Calvin and his imaginary friend Hobbes the tiger went straight to the heart of Americans. My brothers loved it, I loved it, and so C&H; won a place in cartoon immortality, whatever that may turn out to mean. In fact, I suspect that C&H; replaced "Peanuts" as the cartoon strip which everyone read first.I also suspect that the author pulled off a masterstroke by retiring when he did. He probably didn't feel the funny ideas cascading in as they used to, so he just stopped. I hope very much that he is enjoying his retirement, with a pet tiger and a mischievous little boy to give him something to do, aside from sipping pina coladas in his island paradise. :-)

There are now THREE very good Thai grammars available. David Smyth's bookThai: An Essential Grammar (Routledge Grammars)and the Higbie/Thinsan bookThai Reference Grammarwere apparently the first two out of the gate, and now we have a third, which first appeared as a hardback in 2005.This is probably not a book for beginners, BUT this judgement may depend on the type of "beginner" we are talking about. I think that once you have started learning to read Thai --- or even before --- you may find this book extremely useful. And, in an important way, it's useful aside from the grammatical explanations.As a comparison: that old classic, William Kuo'sTeaching Grammar of Thaihad a lot of good grammar, but I came to love it because it presented ONLY Thai script and was fantastic handwriting practice. In a similar way, I appreciate that this is the first truly modern Thai grammar, but even more I love it because it presents hundreds and hundreds of examples of real Thai speech! Where else, for example, can you find a Thai saying, "Well, the electricity was almost unusable, or something like that..." "Or something like that?" How do you say THAT in Thai?So, if you can read Thai in transliteration (and I give this book additional high marks for a transliteration system which is Haas-based and does not have to be learned!!), you may want to start leafing through this book in the early stages of learning the language. It will instantly take you way beyond the "sawatdii khrap" stages, and lead you into things like, "I don't THINK he was here, but I'm not quite sure..."This book is FUN!-------------------------------------Revised review: I am revising this review simply to state that I think this is the best of the three. Especially in the field of particles, it absolutely dusts the competition.

I really can't figure out how many stars to give this book, because I think it depends on your musical expertise. For strong amateurs and professionals, it's apparently a 5-star book. It was way too advanced for me: I tried to read a few pages and just gave up.This book is a lot tougher than the usual liner notes which come with classical music.

"David Copperfield" is the book that Dickens called his "favorite child."I hadn't read this book since high school (long ago), so I had happily forgotten the plot and many of the characters. Upon re-reading, Dickens' genius in creating characters seemed obvious to me. His most memorable characters are "people" you may never forget. I certainly remembered Uriah Heep and Mr. Micawber.Beginning at the beginning, have you ever encountered people as wicked and haughty as Mr. Murdstone and his incredible unmarried sister, Miss Murdstone? Have you ever met such people in the work of any other writer?I would guess not. But there is also Peggoty (David's devoted nurse), the sadistic headmaster of a boys' school who enjoys beating his charges EVERY DAY, David's false idol Steerforth, and characters who truly boggle the mind -- unforgettable people like Uriah Heep and Mr. Micawber.If you think this is easy to do, try it yourself! :-)As for Dickens, Chesterton remarked that -- even if one of his characters was "stolen," he would be back the next day with someone just as fascinating. Chesterton also remarked that his characters were giants who generally did not change -- any more than Miss Murdstone. They were like the gods of Olympus in that respect. (In this book, though, there is one character who changes completely, and over night to boot.)So much for the characters. The story is also interesting!A very high recommendation!!

Let me state at the outset that I am "old-fashioned." I believe that English literature should be written in the English language. By just this one criterion, "The Cantos" are a spectacular failure.I also have an "old-fashioned" respect for the truth, and just glancing through one of the companions to "The Cantos" will show you that Pound made countless mistakes: his reach exceeded his grasp. Some of his failures were quite spectacular; his "translations" from the Chinese come to mind. But they remain failures, even such wonderful poems as "Exile's Letter."In the end, unless you have the patience to go hunting for little gems, "The Cantos" finally boil down to gibberish, corrupted by Pound's lunatic home-brewed economics and his attraction to Mussolini's Fascism. I don't think he was actually insane: his stay in St. Elizabeth's mental hospital was urgently arranged by his literary friends, who did not want to see him jailed or hung for treason. But it remains true that he shut his mouth in his old age, basically admitting that he had been telling people what to do for decades, and that his advice was not always good.If you want to see the better side of Pound, the Library of America has a volume of (basically) everything except "The Cantos:"Ezra Pound: Poems and Translations (Library of America). There's a lot of good stuff in there.

A friend of mine once remarked that this book was simply a part of one's education. For him, this was high praise indeed, and I join him in that.The book is called "Human Action" because it dares to wonder why we ever do anything at all. Why do we get out of bed? Why not laze around, and munch on the fruit falling from the trees? Von Mises' answer deserves to be etched in stone (and I paraphrase):NO MAN EVER DOES ANYTHING UNLESS HE HAS A PERCEIVED DISCOMFORT.So, if we were all living on a Tropical Isle, we might well devote our lives to eating the bananas and swimming in the seas. Just until the neighboring island invades, and slaughters us all. Whoops.Enter "the sense of discomfort." We might, actually, do more than lie around eating bananas: we might take concrete steps to prevent such an invasion, and mount guards. Why are we doing this? Because we do not feel completely secure and comfortable.The genius of Von Mises is to understand that this is a Universal Principle.As his his second Universal Principle:THE GOAL OF HUMAN ACTION IS HAPPINESS.I have been through many, many arguments about this, mostly with friends who were looking for a Transcendent Meaning, or with people who thought this was too Simple.But please consider the case of an 80yo vegetarian living in Burma and donating all of his disposable income to Burmese orphans. Or consider the case of a multi-millionaire who devotes his life to earning a few more millions. Or consider the case of the Swiss doctor who goes to the jungles of Africa to practice medicine there.ALL of them, I submit, are acting from a sense of discomfort, and they are all doing things which will make them happy. When the day is over, they will reflect that the day was well-spent.And that's why people do things. To make their hearts more comfortable, and to make themselves happier.But maybe you already knew that.

I have to thank Andrew McCarthy (author ofSpring Fever: The Illusion of Islamic Democracyfor leading me to this undeservedly overlooked masterpiece.It is basically a history of ideas, beginning just before the French Revolution and continuing to Babeuf, and that's what makes the book so depressing: the idiocies proclaimed by these so-called political philosophers are all revealed as such, especially with the benefit of two or three centuries' hindsight.I will single out two aspects of their "thinking," to keep this review fairly short.The first is the nonsensical idea of the "tabula rasa" or "blank slate," which bubbled up through Avicenna and Aquinas, to become dogma with Locke. The doctrine holds that all men are born with brain contents of zero, and are merely passive "blank slates" on which parents & society can write what they will.Any woman who has four or five sons will laugh her head off at this cockamamie idea: she has actually given birth to "blank slates" and raised them, and is well aware that her children are all different, and have been since Day One.The second absurd idea is a wildly romantic idea about education. After all, if everyone is born equally ignorant, then education may be EVERYTHING...why, we can create equal "citizens" by educating them all equally! As some of these "philosophers" held, we can probably create geniuses at will simply through the right education!Any teacher with real experience will simply shake his head at such foolishness. Have we all forgotten the fact that some students are bright and some students are dumb, and the teacher can't fix that?! It is a brute fact that not everyone completes high school. Furthermore, not everyone will profit from a college education. To bring it to the absurd: not everyone can earn a real Ph.D.None of this stopped the eighteenth-century intellectuals. Without explicitly stating the fact, they discarded God and simply stepped into his place, with the really weird idea that once the universal good was proclaimed (and explained), why, everyone would just follow it out of moral enthusiasm (and enthusiasm for the well-being of their neighbor). It worked so well for Christianity, didn't it? So a re-run without God in the picture should be even BETTER!A more incoherent pile of wishful thinking may have never existed before. It led (with ideas of the "General Will") directly to Soviet Communism, whose commissars were happy to obey Rousseau in killing anyone who did not accept the "general will."What is much more scary is that these ideas are not yet properly dead, with every politician in sight promising "more money for education" (as well as "job training" and "head start," both complete failures). "More money for education" is by now a laff riot, with every additional dollar being sucked up by some non-teaching administrator (e.g. "Vice Principal for Diversity" at $150,000 a year) and almost no one willing to face up to the fact that success in school is very much like success in life: the key element is that thing called "hard work" -- the secret of most private schools.That is to say, you can't buy it: you have to work for it. Is this a vanishing idea in America?A classic book. Read it slowly, and try to control your reactions. But beware: this book is out of print, and used copies do not sell for a song. It's in fairly high demand.

This big, 900-page book appears to be "just another religious book," but it is certainly not that. It appears with the "imprimaturs" of Imam Durubi (Syria), Mufti Salman (Jordanian Armed Forces), Dr. Alwani (President of the International Institute of Islamic Thought), and Muhammed Umar of Al-Azhar University.It is a detailed description of sharia law, to my knowledge unavailable anywhere else, and it is mind-numbing. Another reviewer commented that it was not Constitutional. That is surely correct, but we can say much more: it is completely incompatible with democracy. Remember this about sharia: it will typically be imposed by an Islamic government, and that means that EVERYBODY is bound by it. Any attempt to change your religion gets you the death penalty. Actually, it's worse than that:"Apostasy from Islam is 'the ugliest form of unbelief' for which the penalty is death ('When a person who has reached puberty and is sane voluntarily apostatizes from Islam, he deserves to be killed').(Reliance o8.0 & ff.)"Apostasy occurs not only when a Muslim renounces Islam but also, among other things, when a Muslim appears to worship an idol, when he is heard 'to speak words that imply unbelief,' when he makes statements that appear to deny or revile Allah or the prophet Mohammed, when he is heard 'to deny the obligatory character of something which by consensus of Muslims is part of Islam,' and when he is heard 'to be sarcastic about any ruling of the Sacred Law.' (Reliance o8.7; see also p9.0 & ff.)(By the way, I am extremely grateful to Andrew J. McCarthy for pointing me to this book and providing numerous citations in his masterfulSpring Fever: The Illusion of Islamic Democracy).Put bluntly: Islam may be the dopiest religion on Planet Earth, but if you attempt to escape, even psychically, you're toast.Curious about "charity" and "jihad?" Here you go:"Jihad means to war against non-Muslims." (Reliance o9.0.)It is an annual requirement to donate a portion of one's income to the betterment of the ummah (an obligation called zakat, which is usually, and inaccurately, translated as "charity" - zakat can only be given to Muslims and is designed strictly to fortify the Muslim community, not benefit the less fortunate generally); of this annual donation, one-eighth must be given to "those fighting for Allah, meaning people engaged in Islamic military operations for whom no salary has been allotted in the army roster. . . . They are given enough to suffice them for the operation even if they are affluent; of weapons, mounts, clothing and expenses." (Reliance, h8.1-17.)Well, isn't that interesting, considering how many Muslims have tried to convince us that jihad simply refers to the struggle to live a better life! Actually, Islam knows nothing about such things: you follow the sharia like a blindfolded mule and you've got your ticket to heaven. Just don't pass wind during Ramadan! (Yes, this idiotic book is full of such absurd details about ritual cleanliness, such as which kinds of orgasms make you unclean and require you to perform ritual ablutions. It also has detailed instructions on how to go to the bathroom, including the prayer before entering, entering with the left foot first, exiting with the right foot first, and the exit prayer.)If I had my druthers, everyone on earth would compare this book with Pope Benedict'sIntroduction To Christianity (Communio Books), and figure out who's wearing the thinking cap. At least Benedict has never claimed that Mickey Mouse was a Jewish plot!

The other reviewers have spelled out the many ways in which this book is excellent.So I will boil my review down to one word: RELIABLE. When you are struggling with Abhidhamma or other questions, go to this book first for a RELIABLE overview and summary.Yes, I am utterly familiar with "What the Buddha Taught," an excellent book. But it says little or nothing about the two main streams of Buddhism, Theravada & Mahayana --- and yes, I am aware that some people hate these terms. I also live in a Buddhist country --- have done so for many years --- and am quite interested in the subject of "Export Buddhism" versus "Buddhism in our Daily Life in Thailand.""Export Buddhism" seems to have been fashioned as a replacement product for Unitarianism or other forms of nearly-godless Protestantism. A lot of Americans, including myself, used to say that Buddhism was really more of a philosophy than a religion, since it was not a God-religion like Christianity.Well, welcome to Thailand. Sure, you're right, Buddhism is not a God-religion; it's a religion with a thousand gods, demigods, and Arahants. Rather than being a "pure philosophy" which preaches the doctrine of reincarnation, Thai Buddhism embraces both the idea of going to heaven AND the idea of being reborn. For example, if you have been a really good person, you may go to Heaven for a thousand years, and then be reborn as a great spiritual leader. If you messed up, you may go to Hell for a while, and be reborn as a snake. The central Buddhist ritual in Thailand is "tham boon" == "making merit." This is done in the frank hope of having a better life to come. Rupert Gethin mentions such things, and so the consumers of "Export Buddhism" are naturally shocked!By the way, my current interest is in dhyana / jyana states in meditation. Apparently, these are states of mind available to anyone willing to put in the time and work. And, for a quick look to remind me about this, Gethin's book is RELIABLE.That's pretty high praise!

...about this subject.One reviewer whines "How Do We Know?" and thereby implies directly that the author is a liar, and made up everything reported in this book.While that person may choose to remain in darkness, this book was very well received among professionals, who realized at once that it added more detail (a lot more detail) to the generally known facts about sexuality in New Guinea. In fact, there are many other tribes, reported in the literature, who practice the same system of sexuality -- with the perhaps interesting exception that the sexuality is not oral but via the posterior route.As for disguising the name of the tribe, it seems to me that Herdt has really done something quite remarkable: he has protected his sources. There is no tribe called the "Sambia" in New Guinea, but there is the tribe which Herdt studied, and one of the key elements in their system of male sexuality is that it must be kept SECRET.In this, I must confess that by the age of 60 I have seen this sort of behavior all over the world: men can have all the sex they want together, but it is imperative not to scare the horses. DON'T let the women know.If Herdt had published his book with the tribe's real name, he would have blown their cover. I congratulate him for not doing so.As for what the Sambia are up to, I would suggest reading the book, and not counting on a book review to fill you in on all the details. But as a very high-level view, the Sambia have a superstitious belief that a young boy's development into a full-fledged male is a highly doubtful procedure -- not guaranteed by the spirits or the gods. So they practice "boy invigoration," which entails the young boy receiving regular doses of masculinity. When the boy reaches puberty, the magic has obviously worked, so it is time for him to reverse roles and begin helping the younger ones.All in all, this is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It's true to say, "We're not in Kansas any more, Dorothy." No, we're in the steamy jungle islands of New Guinea and Papua New Guinea, and learning about some of the very flexible limits of human sexuality.Highest possible recommendation!

This movie is a gigantic, successful production on the order of "Gone with the Wind" --- but completely, totally different. There's no Clark Gable, and no Vivien Leigh. But there is a story here, which in the end strikes me as much more compelling, much more revealing of the nature of human love.The entrancing story of "The Children of Paradise" is filmed in the theaters --- and, especially "Crime Boulevard" in front of the theaters. The main female character is Garance (Arletty), a former "courtesan" --- actually hard to describe her, except that she is beautiful and very kind. The main male character is the mime Baptiste, played by Jean-Louis Barrault, who is madly in love with Garance.By the end of this film, Baptiste's cries of "Garance! Garance!" may remind you of Scarlett's cries of "Ashley! Ashley!"Both of them unforgettable screen classics. I think the French one has a little more depth of character, but it's up to you!DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!!! IT IS GREAT!!!

Guy Davenport once commented humorously that he had eleven readers. He was certainly a genius and definitely unconventional. While he loved literature, evidently food meant nothing to him --- he would often dine on fried Oscar Mayer bologna and Campbell's soup.The aspect which I find most puzzling is clearly on view in "Geography" -- his strong taste for incomprehensible writers, or at least "extremely unconventional writers." Olson?? Pound's Cantos? and he moves without hesitation to a philosopher widely viewed as extremely eccentric and hard to understand: Wittgenstein. To put it in another way, if YOU can't make head or tail of someone, you're likely to find that someone on Davenport's list of favorites.But when he flies closer to earth ("closer to the understanding of mere mortals") he has some of his best moments, in my opinion. His chapter on Whitman is really excellent, although you may find his insistence that the internal combustion engine has made life dull a bit of a stretcher. His essay on "Hobbitry" is excellent, and he even manages to say something interesting about Joyce Kilmer's "Trees!"If you have an interest in 20th-century literature, you should take a look at this book. You will almost definitely learn from it, even at moments when you are shaking your head in disagreement. Not to be overlooked, Guy Davenport was a true American original.

For whatever reason, George Washington had never come "alive" for me. Sure: the leader of our troops during the Revolutionary War, our first President, "Father of our Country," and the man on the one-dollar bill.But who exactly was he, and why was he so admired? This had eluded me, until I read Paul Johnson's superb short biography.The short answer is that George Washington was a great man --- great in leadership and also pretty big physically. (De Tocqueville remarked that he had never seen a man with a larger pair of hands.) It is fairly accurate to say that, wherever he went, he dominated, mostly through his moral and ethical qualities. He did not desire political power, but he desired with all his soul and all his being a happy future for America and the American people. He was a genius, and he worked harder than most of us can imagine.Here's one point that really impressed me: Washington's conduct of the Revolutionary War. Gore Vidal, in one of his "historical" novels, absolutely flays Washington alive as a nincompoop and a loser, a "general" who couldn't win a single battle. It is surprising (and educational) to learn from Paul Johnson that Washington was, on the contrary, a brilliant strategist. His strategy was simply to outlast the British by fighting a war of attrition. (Note well: this is something like the strategy employed by Ho Chi Minh against US!) He calculated, accurately, that within 4-5 years the British would tire of the "quagmire" and sue for "negotiations." Which happened, and the USA won the war in the negotiations. (Gore Vidal, of course, omits to mention the tiny detail of George Washington actually winning the war.)Washington was an impressive man, on many different levels, and this book is a masterpiece at revealing the multiple facets of one of the greatest men America ever produced.I must also say that I really appreciate a SHORT biography. I would never read seven volumes of anyone's life, and I am thoroughly fed up with the biographers who feel they must devote a thousand pages to the life of (say) LBJ. "Brevity is the soul of wit," gentlemen!A very high recommendation! I will add, uselessly, that all Americans should read this book.

When I was younger, phrases like "The Greatest Story Ever Told" seemed like ad slogans and I ignored them.Now that I'm older, it strikes me that the tale of Jesus Christ is indeed the greatest story ever told. Whether it be true or false (historically) it has certainly attracted an enormous number of believers -- and, as an amateur historian with a large library of books about Christianity, I have little doubt that the main outlines of the story of Jesus are true.Which leads me to echo another reviewer: Is this the way we human beings treat God? You might want to take a look at Dostoevski's tale of "The Grand Inquisitor" (in his novel "The Brothers Karamazov") for another perspective on the idea that human beings cannot live with the idea of God -- that we cannot tolerate it.Mel Gibson's terrific movie presents that horrifying idea in a way that will not be forgotten. A cinematic masterpiece.

This is a great novel, and I might add, a great novel about two men in love with one another....written by a woman.The love story of Hadrian and Antinous will never die out of human memory, and Marguerite Yourcenar is testimony to that fact.Other reviewers have already pointed out the superb scholarship that went into the making of this book, the excellent writing, and all the rest.I only have one question: why are the best tales of male love written by women? It seems to be a very odd situation: in general, men are the most famous writers, but in the niche of male love, we find such writers as Anne Rice, Mary Renault, Marguerite, and now the "gay manga" from Japan -- stories of male love written for girls! By women!Well, I am puzzled, but I am not about to look a gift-horse in the mouth. This book, along with "The Last of the Wine" and "The Persian Boy," are among the most moving and excellent novels ever written.Unless, of course, you find history to be a bore.

This is one of the very best books I have read in the past decade. When I opened it, John Adams was a cipher to me: just a name ("one of the Founding Fathers"). By the time I finished it, John Adams almost felt like an old friend. A truly American hero, clearly cast in the American mold: a hard-working, thrifty, devout, and utterly incorruptible New England Yankee, who loved working his farm almost as much as he enjoyed reading the classics, and giving this country a giant assist in becoming independent.As an added bonus, you get an entire picture of the American Revolution --- from Adams' point of view, naturally, but he saw almost everything and knew everybody. Additional fascinating portraits include: Ben Franklin as an old man, the celebrated pet of Parisian society; Thomas Jefferson (I began thinking of him as "Lord Jefferson," with his 200 slaves taking care of his every need from cradle to grave); George Washington (of course), and, shining through clearly, his beloved wife Abigail. Many minor portraits also fascinate: Alexander Hamilton, John Quincy Adams (his brilliant son), Louis XVI of France, and George III of England. Even Marie Antoinette makes a stellar appearance.Over time, this book almost approaches being a dual biography, of Adams and Jefferson, two totally different men: Adams thrifty and Jefferson spendthrift; Adams dying with money in the bank and Jefferson dying in deep debt. These two became fast friends in France, and then Jefferson turned them into political enemies by undermining Adams while serving as Adams' Vice-President.In a surprise turn of events, the friendship resumed many years later, when all of the political strife was so much water under the bridge. In one of history's most amazing coincidences, both men died on the same exact day: July 4th, 1826 --- the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.Adams enjoyed his retirement, after his spell in the White House. He lived to see his son elected President, and as he aged, his thoughts grew deeper and deeper. The world became more and more miraculous to him. One diary entry reads:"I never delighted much in contemplating commas and colons, or in spelling or measuring syllables, but now...if I attempt to look at these little objects, I find my imagination, in spite of all my exertions, roaming in the Milky Way, among the nebulae, those mighty orbs, and stupendous orbits of suns, planets, satellites, and comets, which compose the incomprehensible universe; and if I do not sink into nothing in my own estimation, I feel an irresistible impulse to fall on my knees, in adoration of the power that moves, the wisdom that directs, and the benevolence that sanctifies this wonderful whole."This sounds very close to a theophany, perhaps the last thing one would have expected in a biography of an industrious, common-sense farmer and lawyer."Take him for all in all, we shall not see his like again."A truly wonderful book.

In "The Varieties of Religious Experience," William James devotes an early chapter to a type of personality most of us have known: the man who is perennially optimistic and cheerful, and almost always in a sunny mood. This "healthy mind," says James, is easy to see in a person like Walt Whitman --- and he would doubtless have included Ralph Waldo Emerson as another obvious example. In such persons, according to James, "happiness is congenital and irreclaimable." Matthew Arnold put it this way: "Emerson's systematic benevolence comes from what he himself calls somewhere his 'persistent optimism,' and his persistent optimism is the root of his greatness and the source of his charm."One of the golden nuggets in this Emerson anthology is the famous essay on "Self-Reliance." Modern readers might imagine that this essay would be about economics, but not so: the heart of it is this ---"There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself, for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried."To put it in other words, "Know thyself" (Socrates would agree) and "Be thyself." Aping celebrities and adopting ideologies are no part of self-reliance; in fact, Emerson explicitly deplores men who have become slaves of an ideology. "If I know your sect I anticipate your argument." In fact, "whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist." Conformity makes men not just false in a few small things, but false in everything.This is most excellent advice, and should be followed while reading Emerson --- or anyone else. You will find yourself disagreeing with him from time to time, and Emerson himself would surely approve and applaud.The physical book reviewed here is extremely well-edited and well-made. The introduction by Mary Oliver is excellent and helpful. Unless you become a true Emerson devotee, this volume is likely to be all you need.

The argument offered in this book is that the Darwinian theory of evolution does not apply to us --- that it does not apply to modern man, citizens of Cupertino, Manchester, and Kyoto. And I must admit that, when the question is put that way, it gives one pause. After all, Darwinian evolution is a nasty, fierce struggle for the survival of the fittest. Stove mentions, just for starters, the universal human institutions of soldiers, doctors, and priests. Every one of these special professions is altruistic, culminating perhaps in the Chief Matron of the Maternity Ward in any large hospital: she gets a huge amount of respect because she saves lives on a daily basis, altruistically helping unrelated women and children to get through the ordeal of birth --- and she does it every day.When you think about it, such phenomena contradict the Darwinian theory completely, as does another strange phenomenon: "baby-stealing." Some mothers lose their babies very early, and a few of THOSE will go and steal another woman's baby. As Stove points out, most of us can get to a point where we "understand" this crime, and the enormous pain which caused it. The reaction of Darwinians (such as Dawkins) is dumbfounding: they claim that the mother whose baby has been stolen should be GLAD, because her little DNA-package is going to be raised at no cost by someone else. And they completely fail to understand the thief ("Why would anyone devote her life to rearing someone not related to them?")Well, I imagine such titanic geniuses would also fail to understand adoption, huh.Stove pushes things a bit farther when he states that, since Darwinian evolution is false for US, it it therefore a false theory because it CLAIMS to be about all living things. At the same time, Stove has no real problem with accepting the vast explanatory scope of evolution, so he seems to be suggesting that we have not yet got the theory down.I have to mention the extraordinary writing skills of this man. Many of his essays are as tasty as mint fudge sundaes; they leave you wanting MORE.This review is of the Kindle edition, which is very easy to read.

I have used this series of books myself, and they are very good. Well thought-out and highly recommended. I would just point out that this "starter" book is not really for absolute beginners, at least in Thailand, Russia, or any other country using a non-Latin alphabet. Students need to learn their ABC's and master elementary reading before trying this book, and that can take weeks or months of practice.

Chesterton once described this early work as a bit of moonshine, but a lot of readers clearly think it is more than that. If I described this as a "meditation on the human condition," you'd get the idea that the book isn't any fun --- and that's wrong, the book is a lot of fun. It is typically Chestertonian in that he can hardly get through a paragraph without thoughts and "asides" that are very thought-provoking.This was one of Kingsley Amis's favorite books --- a bit of a surprise, there! I would guess that Amis was mainly seduced by the gloriously inventive prose, but Amis himself says that he was drawn in by the completely original, Alice-in-Wonderland plot.And when you're done, you will probably be thinking about two of the main "issues" of the human condition: burning issues that are often turned into dry dust by academic philosophers: free will and the problem of evil. Aren't they related? Leaving aside natural disasters and "acts of God," how can we possibly account for the horrors of the 20th century, and the millions and millions massacred by that century's slave-drivers? The Chestertonian answer is, I suspect, the Christian answer: God would not have bothered to create a race of robots, but instead created man in His own image --- free to choose, and free to act. What follows from that, as night follows the day, is that SOME human beings will choose to do wicked and evil things.I also find it interesting that Ezra Pound and his circle positively LOATHED G. K. Chesterton, as some sort of backward bourgeois humbug. Well, time will tell. :-)A very entertaining and stimulating read! Don't miss it, and don't miss Chesterton!

I have just finished re-reading "The Razor's Edge." This must be my third time around with this novel, over a span of many years. Yet it continues to fascinate me; sometimes I think I'm still playing "catch-up" with Maugham. The same goes for "The Summing Up" and his short stories --- they are so good that they invite re-reading after a decade or so has gone by."The Razor's Edge" is a pretty simple story, which might be titled "My Encounters with Larry." Maugham apologizes for this at the outset, and even goes so far as to write in something like "the real first person," where the characters address him as "Maugham." The character who attracts the lion's share of attention is a young American named Larry, who was badly shocked during World War I and afterward set out on a search to discover the meaning of life with a private income of $3,000 per year.Put that way, it sounds completely corny --- but, then again, aren't many of us searching for the meaning of life? We may not have $3,000 a year (quite a bit back then, at least enough to live on) and we may not have the iron backbone of Larry, who is not just "dabbling" and "posing," but is quite capable of spending the entire day reading through William James' "Principles of Psychology."But how can you tell a tale like this without making it utterly boring?Maugham's answer to this problem works splendidly. He surrounds his central character with a cast of extremely vivid characters, none of whom are concerned with searching for the meaning of life --- because they all believe they already KNOW the meaning of life, and are avidly pursuing it. The amiable snob Templeton devotes his entire life to social climbing, and believes that, after death, he will "move in the best circles" in Heaven! After all, Heaven has gradations as well: Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels and the rest. The main female character, Isabel, has a hopeless lifelong crush on Larry, but her "meaning of life" is almost exactly defined as "upper-middle-class American prosperity," and she eventually marries Gray Maturin, who is quite sure that the meaning of life is "work, money, and a beautiful wife." These characters and more are thrown into the world of the 1920's, and they all find their lives drastically altered by the character-revealing stock market crash and Depression. As these characters endlessly pursue their own small ends, Larry continues steadfastly working on the eternal questions of God's existence and the meaning of life.The book is superbly well-written. I had an excellent teacher at UCLA who told his class that "Maugham may not be an 'A' writer, but almost everyone admits that he is the very best of the 'B' writers." That judgment may have been an understatement. Whatever else you may say about Somerset Maugham, he wrote well and was a tremendous storyteller. I am personally convinced that his short stories are overdue for a major revival.In the meantime, if you have any interest in those Big Questions, I can recommend this book to you without reservation. The resolution is not philosophically or theologically simple --- not by any means. But it coheres --- it holds together. And that is no task for a "grade-B" writer.A terrific book!!

Well, "Poor Folk" probably qualifies as a "novella," since it's quite short, a LOT shorter than "War and Peace!"This first novel was a critical success but not a popular success. The leading Russian critic praised it to the skies, which made Dostoevsky think that fame and success were just around the corner, but it didn't sell at all well, and the bubble of hope got popped. In fact, D's reputation went into a severe decline, and didn't really revive until he wrote "Crime and Punishment" decades later.Still, "Poor Folk" is an interesting read and a touching tale. It's one of the first books in world history to take poor people seriously, and treat them as if they were (gasp) real human beings. Dostoevsky's skill at portraying human psychology is already obvious, and I suppose it's a "must read" for his fans."Poor Folk" is, for me, by far the best thing in this book (I am reviewingPoor Folk and Other Stories (Penguin Classics). The other stories in this book were not nearly as well done.

I have made several runs at Aristotle (trying to understand him), but they all failed until I got this book.At last, I am beginning to understand Aristotle's idea of the "formal cause," which comes along with his set of four causes. For example, I pick Michelangelo's statue of David.The "material cause" (strange wording) is: marble.The "efficient cause" is: Michelangelo.The "formal cause" is: (here difficulties arise) either the form in Michelangelo's mind, or the form of the male body.The "final cause" is: Michelangelo's desire to create a supreme work of art.We moderns don't think this way any more. Is that a plus, or a minus??In any case, if you want a beginner's course in Aristotle (a man who dominated philosophy for two thousand years or more), this book is highly recommended.

If you actually sit down and read this book, you will find the following FASCINATING information on page 98, "President Carter at Home."For context, remember that Carter's overwhelming domestic problem was inflation, which reached 13% during his presidency. I had read this book (rapidly) a few months ago, but came back for clues about how this particular disaster happened.Well, the answer is obvious. Carter expanded the money supply. Not once or twice, but continuously. He seemed to have some vague idea that printing (or authorizing) more money would just generally be a good idea. But it's hard to say why Jimmy Carter did anything.When asked about inflation, in April of 1978, Jimmy Carter said, and I quote: "It is a myth that the government itself can stop inflation."OK, if you understand Basic Economics, you can pick your jaw up off the floor. But even more fascinating is what Jimmy went on to say. He said that inflation forced us to confront unpleasant facts about ourselves, such as the fact that some people were selfish and refused to make sacrifices for the common welfare.So how did Jimmy Carter explain inflation? It obviously had nothing to do with his own constant expansion of the money supply. Nope, it was the fault of the idiots who elected him, those selfish American people.This is your clue here: when Jimmy Carter starts explaining things to you, don't bother listening unless you want a totally unfounded guilt-trip.

I am wondering why Hermann Hesse gave the name of "Siddhartha" to this novel. As people over the age of 23 know, Siddhartha was the given name of the Buddha.So, naturally, young people would grab the book, and read through it, and say to each other, "Wow! Listen to this!" --- while they were only reading the completely stupid thoughts of Hesse himself.I am afraid that this goes for "Steppenwolf" and "Magister Ludi" as well --- it's all Hermann Hesse's jejune philosophy, and none of it works, unless you're toking at the same time. "Wow! Listen to this, dude!"It is entirely amazing to me that fifty years on, I would realize that the philosophy of J.R.R. Tolkien was absolutely rock-solid, while the philosophy of Hesse was completely incoherent.After all, Hesse was a "serious novelist," while Tolkien only wrote "fantasy."Nevertheless, Tolkien was, in most questions, right. SeeThe Philosophy of Tolkien: The Worldview Behind The Lord of the Ringsfor the details!

This book is worth buying just for Chamber's preface in the form of a letter written to his children.This is one of the most magnificent essays of the twentieth century, and it really helped me to understand what a Communist was. Chambers obviously devoted enormous thought to this question, and his answer is both brilliant and appalling. "Philosophers have explained the world; it is necessary to change the world." (Alert readers will note that the first half of this sentence is absurd. Philosophers have NOT explained the world; far from it.)The Communist is not an armchair theorist; he is a dedicated, secret revolutionary. The ends, for the Communist, justify the means. Thus, the "Daily Worker" could write that "Honesty is a bourgeois virtue." In Whittaker's day, every true Communist realized that he was complicit with terror and torture. And he accepted those terrible facts because "it was necessary to change the world."That is to say, the dedicated Communist of the 1930's and 1940's had a lot in common with the dedicated jihadi of today. Although the comparison may be repellent to a great many people, the Communist of Chambers' era had a lot in common with today's Al Qaeda, and with the anarchist bomb-throwers of the late 19th and early 20th century (those lovely people who ignited World War I by killing the Archduke Ferdinand).Nevertheless, sometimes they heard people screaming.Chambers viewed the conflict between Communism and freedom as a conflict between those people who worshipped Man versus those who worshipped God. This is not an analysis which will sit comfortably with many modern "progressives," but it is a compelling one. After all, the Communists must have had some reason for destroying religion wherever they came to power: Russia, China, Cambodia, etc. Why? Why couldn't Communism coexist with religion, where (say) Napoleon could?I don't want to go into too much detail, and I simply cannot paraphrase this magnificent essay. But I do think that anyone putting together a collection of the most brilliant essays of the last century could no more exclude this than they could exclude Orwell's "Politics & the English Language."

I am reviewing this book as a rank amateur in philosophy. I got curious about Avicenna when he was prominently mentioned in Varghese'sThe Wonder of the World: A Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God. According to Varghese, Avicenna was one of the extremely important philosophers who helped to create "The Matrix" --- which is what enabled modern science to take off. Varghese's list includes Avicenna, Maimonides, Aquinas, and Madhvacharya (an Indian philosopher I had never heard of!)So I ordered this book with some trepidation, afraid of some totally dry treatise which would bore me to tears, and I got the very opposite: an extremely well-written summary of Avicenna which answers any and all questions I had about this philosopher, universally considered the greatest thinker produced by Islam. I particularly enjoyed the details of the local Persian history in Khorasan, which seems to resemble the American Wild West in a lot of ways. But then, I've lived in Iran and have a natural interest in the place. (Avicenna, by the way, was a Persian who wrote in Arabic.) The summaries of Avicenna's books are clear --- magnificently clear, if I may say so.A good companion to this book might beThe Closing of the Muslim Mind.Highest recommendation for this book!

This is a great way to begin learning Thai -- to acquire the essential foundation people need in learning a foreign language. The only complaint I have is that -- once you start seriously looking into the Pimsleur method -- you discover that the complete foundation includes Level I, Level II, and Level III. Each level has thirty 30-minute lessons. And there is no indication of when Level II and Level III are coming.On the other hand, there is some indication about when the opposite course (English for Thai Speakers) is coming: December 2009.But this "complaint" only amounts to saying: I want more! This is very useful stuff!----- Review edited ------I have read a couple of reviews which say that the Pimsleur method is "Listen and Repeat," which is almost completely false. Granted, when introducing entirely new words, you will be told to listen and repeat. But 99% of the time, you are required to LISTEN AND TRANSLATE.That is to say, the CD will prompt you:CD: Now, do you remember how to say "Tomorrow is Monday" in Thai?And you are expected to say "Prung nii wan jan."As for "just listening," that is absolutely forbidden by the instructions that come with these courses. The instructions basically say "If you are just going to listen, forget it." You have to translate and SPEAK. OUT LOUD. ALL THE TIME.Ready? Set. GO! :-)"My name is Nit"---phom chuu nit khrap"I am from Chiang Rai"---phom maa jaak chiang rai khrap.The sentences with "---" are what you must SAY, OUT LOUD, ALL THE TIME.So Pimsleur is most certainly not just listening, and it is also not "listen and repeat." It's constant "LISTEN & TRANSLATE" right now!---- Review edited -----So, what do I do when I have finished this 30-lesson Level I Thai course? Well, get the Linguaphone Thai Course and begin finishing the job! :-)----- update 1/26/2011 ---------I recently revisited this course, and once again saw the main thing I dislike about it. I can't really call it a complaint, because it arises from the nature of the Thai language: men and women speak it differently. The differences are small, but they are real: a man says "phom saap khrap" and a woman says "dichan saap kha."This course "handles" the problem by having all the dialogues between a man and a woman. The result is a grand waste of time for either sex: they will wind up spending half of their time practicing a version of Thai which they will never, ever speak (leaving future drag queens and toms out of it for the moment. :-) )But how could this problem be fixed? Obviously, with two different courses: Thai for Male Speakers, and Thai for Female Speakers. This would double the production costs of the course, and might even bring wrathful lawsuits from grievance-seeking feminists.So I don't see a clear way out of this problem. Just be aware of it when you buy the course.

Anyone interested in the revolting history of Christian anti-Semitism can find one of the founding documents here. I am amazed that two people posted reviews of this book and didn't even mention the truly disgusting language and images employed by this so-called "Saint." In fact, the latest edition of the works of the "Fathers of the Church" simply omits these homilies because they are so repellent.

For years, I have kept a cherished copy of this book, probably because someone I know and admire wrote a glowing review of it in the Asian press.Recently, however, despite the fact that I live in Thailand and am fascinated by the region, I realized that I had never read this book!So I picked it up again, and began to understand why. From the very first pages, the reader is assaulted with terms for peoples (Mon, Wa, etc.) which remain totally unexplained. Of course, someone who has spent his life dealing with the history of Thailand feels that such terms are self-explanatory, but they are NOT.Add to this particular opacity, what? The plodding style of the author, who is apparently incapable of generating reader interest or suspense no matter how compelling the tale. And then add in the fact that Wyatt took TWENTY YEARS to revise the first edition, and produce a second, slightly better edition, and you are forced to the conclusion that Wyatt finds writing in English to be an extremely difficult job.And, if you are writing history for anyone but specialists, that very nearly disqualifies you.Nevertheless, this book is probably the ONLY available general history of Thailand. How sad!

This is a very good book, and it's about 3/4 Greek rather than Roman literature.Since it's mostly Greek literature, you might consider Michael Grant'sGreek Literature: An Anthology: Translations from Greek Prose and Poetry (Penguin Classics), which I actually prefer and which can be picked up used for a song.

I have been looking through this fascinating book for several days, and I am convinced that it gives me a good view into the classic education of Catholic children. Sister Miriam Joseph was truly dedicated to the value of such an education, and who can fault her?The book is very old-fashioned, and it may contain too much warmed-over Aristotle, but it does get some things absolutely right: logic and grammar are essential to good speaking and good writing, and rhetoric is an essential study for those who would try for excellence. Just today I was reading more complaints from English teachers about the faults of the current curriculum; every time they assign some writing, it comes in with horrifying mistakes in both grammar and logic.For a deeper (and more interesting) discussion of rhetoric, I would recommendFarnsworth's Classical English Rhetoric.

If anything shines out clearly from Tolkien's letters, it is the quite amazing fact that, while Tolkien was writing "The Lord of the Rings," he did not feel like the Writer of the Tale. Again and again, he mentions the fact that "the story took hold of him." While he thought that he needed to write a chapter about "X," lo and behold --- he wrote three chapters.It may not be too far from the mark to think that Tolkien was inspired by a Muse, although he himself would never have claimed any such thing. In the same way as Wolfgang Mozart, who used to say, while writing music, that he was simply transcribing the music that had appeared in his head, as if by a miracle. Or Michelangelo, who said that his statue of David was already clear in his mind when he confronted the huge bloc of marble, and "all he had to do was chip away the non-David bits."If Tolkien was not the Writer of the Tale....if Mozart did not invent his own music...if Michelangelo was somehow inspired while creating his statue of David...Artistic creation is sometimes a strange thing. Can people really be inspired by a Muse?

Other reviewers have summarized the plot of this novel pretty well. I would add that it is very well-written and constructed by a master hand.There is a one-star review which complains that the novel is too class-conscious. But of course, you could hardly write a novel about England of those times without describing the reign of social class in England. What may need saying is that a lot of that description was written with a pen dipped in vitriol! Actually, the emphasis on class is something that still surprises me in Englishmen; it seems to be all-pervasive, and I think the sneer is still ready for "the working class" (what an odd name for a class!) and for "people in trade." ("The working class" strikes Americans as strange because Americans basically assume that everyone works, except the idle rich, children, and oldsters. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were hardly layabouts.)Ostensibly a novel about writers, and about Edward Driffield in particular, the character of Driffield's wife Rosie ends up stealing the show. She also gets the last line in the book, which will leave most readers wondering whether to laugh or cry.A highly enjoyable and stimulating read, right up there withThe Moon and Sixpence (Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading).

Of course, you may already be a fan of the Haydn Quartets, but if you are not, these CDs (there is a second CD with Op. 76, Nos. 4-6) may well convert you. When I came upon them (thanks to Theodore Dalrymple), they absolutely qualified as "Beautiful Music You Have Never Heard Before," my favorite FM radio show during the year I spent in Austin, Texas.You can try these out on YouTube, but for the full beauty you need these CDs playing on your home system.

This book seems to be incredibly repetitious at the beginning, but it is repeating something which many people searching for financial freedom need to get right, once and for all.Much more than "pay yourself first" (save money) you need to concentrate all of your effort on buying ASSETS, not LIABILITIES. In particular, the author squares off with the received wisdom by viewing a home purchase as a liability, not an asset.Well, he's surely not the only person who thinks so. Warren Buffett among others was a renter until he began to get sincerely prosperous. My own dad was another ("Never try to make money off your home. After all, you live in it.")But, leaving the home aside for a moment, what this guy is saying is quite simple: buy stocks, bonds, commercial paper, commercial real-estate: whatever, but buy ASSETS. If you run out and buy a new Mercedes-Benz, you have just assumed a huge liability. If the Benz costs (say) $40,000 --- that $40,000 could be put into stocks, bonds, and apartment houses, where it would probably bring in something like $4,000 a year. The car is simply an expense of many thousands per year.It's hard to quarrel with this, but two other points of view come to mind. One is (of all things) "Personal Finance for Dummies," which reminds people that money is not the most important thing in life. Well, in "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," it IS the most important thing in life. For all the bragging that Rich Dad does about being the master of money rather than its slave, it seems clear that he works dawn-to-dusk in the service of Money.The other point of view --- really, a point of difference --- comes in the second half of the book, where the author shares his "secret" methods of growing rich rapidly. One amounts to flipping and trading real estate --- which may work --- but the other one seems downright zany: cashing in on the IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) of companies which are about to go public. Well, I have lived through exactly one situation like that: a hot software company was about to go public, and stock options had already been awarded --- and then, at the last moment --- there was another offering for families and friends. The only people who heard about this offer were precisely the families and friends of employees, plus the people who had initially funded the company (e.g., a group of Swiss investors).This whole thing worked out fairly well for my family --- my friends all thought that I was trying to sell them penny-stock, and universally hung up in horror when I was trying to do them a favor --- but it strikes me as very unrealistic for Mr. and Mrs. Main Street.Still, all in all, the first half of the book is something to concentrate your mind: what am I buying with my money? Am I buying assets or liabilities? Would I be better off (in the long run) with that $1,000 set of golf clubs, or should I settle for some much less expensive golf clubs and sock the rest into investments?Very interesting reading.

Translating poetry is a tricky thing. Some people maintain that it can't be done. I would say that the translator can set himself three possible goals. First, he can try to create a "trot," a plain, "literal" translation where every word of the original is explained. See Nabokov's "Eugene Onegin" for an example of this. Second, he can try "simply" to translate it, to give his reader a good idea of what is there on the page, the mood, and so forth. LOTS of translators do this.Third, and most elusive, most difficult, is to create a work of literary art IN ENGLISH (or whatever the target language is). Hopefully this third goal will automatically include all the most important elements of "mere translation." But, if the translator succeeeds, he will have created an independent work of art which will then take on a life of its own. The most famous example of this would probably be FitzGerald's "Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam," probably better described as a fantasy and variations on themes of Omar Khayyam. Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's "Iliad" surely has legs, still in print after all these years.David Ferry has attempted the third goal in his translation of "Gilgamesh," and to my mind he succeeds. The result is a moving and beautiful work of literary art, and I predict a very long life for it.

First, I have to confess to a mistake. For most of my life, I have steadfastly maintained that music is to be heard, not watched.Well, that position may be Logical, but it is not necessarily True.Consider this amazing DVD. The first part stars Martha Argerich and Evgeny Kissin playing a wonderful piano "duet" by Mozart. It is truly fascinating to watch the interactions between the older woman and the younger guy, as they perform flawless music!Then another piano is wheeled onto the stage, and four master pianists whomp it up with a piece by Smetana. After a "Happy Birthday" piece, we are treated to J.S. Bach's "Concerto for Four Pianos and Orchestra in a Minor."I could stop right here, and so I guess I should. The world's greatest pianists, playing some of the best piano music ever written: well, it's just fabulous!!!In case you haven't guessed, I love this DVD!! :-)

I think this movie is destined to be a classic. They say that fine wine gets better with age, and that definitely applies to Clint Eastwood in "Gran Torino." The story is compelling -- it kept me up way past my bedtime because I had to know what happened next. That's one way to know you're in the hands of a master storyteller. Another way to know the same thing is when the ending comes as a complete surprise which, in retrospect, is totally inevitable --- and profoundly moving.This movie jumped immediately into my top ten favorites of all time, and I think it may be the best thing Eastwood has ever done.

In this book McGee is trapped outside his usual operating sphere, and forced to learn how to deal with the oligarchy running a small town.The real catalyst is the murder plot. Jas Yeoman is wildly in love with his wife Mona, but suddenly she conceives a romantic passion for a teacher and decides to run off.I won't spoil much by telling you that the murder of Mona Yeoman is one of the first things in the book, and that Travis McGee spends the rest of the book trying to figure out what happened.Excellent reading, as always!

I'm not sure how often I have read "The Lord of the Rings." For sure, the first time would have been around 1958, when I was about twelve years old. This was before the book became so popular, so I spent a decade telling friends about this magnificent book.Then the hippies got "into" this book and almost entirely failed to understand it.As the years rolled by, I began to seriously wonder what I meant when I said that the hippies failed to understand it. They generally understood the story, and the beauty of the story, but what they didn't grasp was the world-view, the understanding of humanity, which gave birth to the tale.Now, thankfully, this book answers the underlying question, and does a splendid job of doing it. If you are a fan of Tolkien, you owe it to yourself to at least LOOK at this book, and find out whether you are really into dressing-up like Orcs and Elves for fantasy conventions, or interested in the philosophical and theological background which is expressed in almost every line of the book. I'll throw in an example, one of the "50 questions" which are the backbone of this book: "Which is more important, romance or sex?" You will probably not be a bit surprised to learn Tolkien's answer, which was clearly "romance." But it may lead to asking yourself the parallel question: "Which is more important TO YOU, romance or sex?"All in all, a great piece of writing and a book which belongs in your library.

Other reviewers have done a fine job with this book, and so I am going to zero in on Chapter 7, "Deconcealing Van Gogh," which is my absolute favorite.Why? Because the "art critic" whose buffoonery is revealed here is none other than that notorious German windbag, humbug, and Nazi, Martin Heidegger. I have previously made attempts to attack Heidegger as a philosopher, but the camp of "Heidegger faithful" is immune to criticism: they always reply that critics are simply too stupid to understand the Great Master, the Most Important Philosopher of the Twentieth Century (If Not Of All Time). When you subsequently ask for the enlightened ones to explain it to you, they simply cannot.But here, Heidegger has taken plenty of rope, all that he needed to hang himself. The painting in question is Van Gogh's "A Pair of Shoes," and the canvas is exactly what you would expect: two shoes!! (If you would like to see this painting for yourself, just drop "National Gallery of Art Van Gogh Two Shoes" into your nearest search engine.)So: it's a picture of two old shoes: more than enough to set off Heidegger's humbuggery, which just BEGINS by claiming that "Art is truth setting itself to work," whatever that might happen to mean. This painting is not just two old shoes, my friends, it is "truth setting itself to work!"We'd better sit right up and pay attention, then!Heidegger waxes on, about the peasant woman who wore these shoes, trudging out to the peasant fields day after day ("from the dark opening of the worn insides of the shoes the toilsome tread of the worker stares forth"), throwing in a lot of typical humbuggery about "the ever-uniform furrows of the field swept by a raw wind." Has anyone noticed that the actual PAINTING is disappearing into the distance? The painting is a painting of TWO SHOES, and those "ever-uniform furrows of the field" exist ONLY IN MARTIN HEIDEGGER'S IMAGINATION.I won't make this any longer. Suffice it to say that Heidegger is totally wrong about everything. The shoes were Van Gogh's own shoes --- so that peasant woman and those fields swept by a raw wind are simply catastrophic errors. Moreover, as some genius pointed out, couldn't Heidegger have derived all of his sublime thoughts simply from a pair of REAL SHOES?Well, in future, people who tell me that "Being and Time" is something other than a thick volume of irrelevant nonsense will be shown the door. :-)And, to sum up, that is only ONE chapter of this black comedy of a book.Highest possible recommendation!

Well, that's a large claim to make, but I'm going to be 60 in a few months and so I will state my frank opinion: the Dvorak Cello Concerto is the best piece of music ever written by mankind, and you should really listen to THIS version, with Pierre Fournier on the cello, and George Szell conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.This could hardly be called "program music." Yet it seems to address any questions which you bring to it -- questions about love, mortality, and the gods, among many others. And there are many, many moments when Dvorak is simply "out there" -- communicating with the stars.My runner-up is the Brahms Violin Concerto! :-)

The rarest thing in music is melody, or so I have been told. In this case, the Andante (2nd movement) of the Barber Violin Concerto is a gold mine.If I compare the recordings of Gil Shaham and Hilary Hahn, I come up with something I've noticed before: some musicians apparently think that hitting all the notes with perfect accuracy is all they need to do, while other musicians pour their emotion into the music, not quite ignoring the metronome but obeying the inner emotions of the music.Musicians of Type "A" may record the piano music of Debussy, but dismiss "Clair de Lune" as immature fluff. Musicians of Type "B" may devote long years to mastering the immature fluff.So this is what I find with Gil Shaham (performing like a classic type A) and Hilary Hahn, performing like a virtuoso type B. You might want to get both performances and judge for yourself; I found the comparison a very interesting lesson in music.

Alexander Herzen was truly one of a kind, a splendid and amazingly well-informed conversationalist, one of the leaders of the radical Russian forces (from exile in London), and a very compelling writer.Yet virtually nobody (!) in the U.S. has even heard of him. They confuse him with Herzl or Hertz (the guy with the cycles). I'm surely as "guilty" as anyone; I only stumbled across this book in Joseph Frank's biography of Dostoevsky --- one of the many gifts of that biography.If nothing else, these memoirs of the immensely wealthy family Herzen was born into will make you understand two things with utter clarity: (1) How to be miserable though rich --- Herzen's father was one of the most miserable and bitter creatures on earth, God knows why (2) Why social conditions in Russia had to change. Herzen includes an unforgettable story about how his father literally destroyed the life of one of his serfs, and having done so, proceeded to "free" the broken man in his will --- which only amounted to getting rid of him, since the broken man shuffled off and was never heard from again.This is a brilliant, moving, wonderful book. It's a great pity that it's out of print. It almost makes me want to go look for the four-volume unabridged translation by Constance Garnett!

The English translations are not much to brag about, but they are there to serve a specific purpose: enabling us to read the original French. When we are engaged on such a project, we actually do not care about the beauty of the English translations: we need a trot, pretty much.What matters more, I think, is whether the short stories are worth reading, and here Wallace Fowlie has scored a major triumph. Maupassant's "Menuet" and Balzac's "La Messe de l'Athee" are simply superb, and I look forward to reading the rest!

It is hard to find enough good words to praise Joseph Frank's achievement in this triumphant literary biography. It is one of the most satisfying things I have ever read. At times you think that Frank is getting a little too detailed, but within a minute you understand the purpose of the detail. There is an equally telling moment in this final volume, when Dostoevsky is replying to an editor who wants D. to cut "an unnecessary detail." Dostoevsky's reply is vastly illuminating. To paraphrase: "You must remember that it is not I, the author, who is speaking: it is Ivan Karamazov, the literary character. This 'unnecessary detail' is meant to show the reader that Ivan has been thinking about this crime, and other similar crimes, for years. He didn't just read about them and forget them; he has been meditating on them for a long time, and this 'little detail' is proof of his very detailed thinking. Please remember this in the future: you are not reading what the author thinks, you are reading the thoughts of an artistically created character."Whew! So much for Dostoevsky being a "sloppy writer."He was also, in a strange way, the world's first blogger! He did it without computers or the Internet, but his journal "A Writer's Diary" was almost exactly what good bloggers create today: it was written by himself (100 percent) and actually sold very well. It was this "blog" which brought him to national prominence and fame, as well as his public readings, which moved audiences to tears and brought fifteen or twenty standing ovations.As for "The Brothers Karamazov," at some level it cannot be "explained" --- literary masterpieces do not lend themselves to "explanation" very well: they create and exist in their own world, from "The Iliad" through "The Little Prince." But Joseph Frank surely provides all the available explanatory background, and it is actually thrilling to see all the little pieces of Dostoevsky's life coming together as he finally and confidently creates the masterwork which stunned his countrymen, and still stuns the world.Books are gateways to other worlds. Nineteenth-century Russia is so different from twenty-first century America that Frank's work amounts to a magic-carpet ride, transporting us to an alien yet extremely important time and place, where vast intellectual and social forces were getting ready to completely shatter the "Old Russia" and give birth to something totally unexpected and vastly malignant. Abstract ideas such as "Utopian Socialism" and "Left Hegelian atheism" --- the intellectual brew stirred up by Chernyshevsky and many others --- were preparing the ground for the coup led by Lenin, and the Communist government that eventually produced sixty million corpses.This biography winds up being about much more than Dostoevsky --- it has to be about much more. It will open your eyes to the world of nineteenth-century philosophy and literature in a completely new way. Names such as Schiller, George Sand, Eugene Sue, and Victor Hugo take on new aspects and are seen in a new light. I would compare this experience to a really excellent graduate course taught by a brilliant teacher.Highest possible recommendation!

If you have never read anything by Balzac before, then prepare yourself for an adventure. For one thing, as Balzac's intrepid biographer notes, it is a bit odd that "Pere Goriot" has become the school-assigned-text of choice. Not only do crime, corruption, and vanity reach levels which shock the average reader, Balzac also slips in the first case of a huge attraction of an older man for a younger man.The difficulties begin when you begin reading the book: Balzac devotes pages and pages to describing the "Maison Vauquer," and manages to convince the reader that this squalid boarding house is not only boring and squalid, but perhaps incomprehensible to people who live outside of Paris. If you make it through this opening section, you will have begun to accustom yourself to Balzac -- who is at one time the worst of writers, and the best --- and who also feels completely free to assault you with his home-baked philosophy of life at every turn."Pere Goriot" has often been compared to "King Lear," but as soon as the comparison is made, we need to begin counting the enormous differences between the two works. Lear loved his daughters, but he can't hold a candle to Goriot in this respect. Lear was disillusioned rather quickly, while Goriot died with his fantasies intact.However, this lurks in the future. The first thread of the story is the tale of the young provincial Rastignac, who has come to make his mark on Paris. He is ambitious, but we need to understand what this term means for Balzac. Ambitious? Does this refer to a young student of medicine, who wants to advance the science of medicine, or to a young writer, who wants to write the most dazzling works he can?Well, no. For Balzac (and all the characters of his "Human Comedy") "ambition" means nothing more than social climbing. "Success" means being received in the highest circles of Parisian society, most likely the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Readers who thought of "ambition" in other terms will need to re-calibrate here.Before long, our young hero Rastignac is getting a full-blown lecture on the delights of a life of crime, from the mysterious and sinister M. Vautrin. He proposes a monstrous scheme to our young hero for marrying into a dowry of a million francs --- a scheme which will involve "only one murder."Well, I can't reveal any more of the story without ruining it. But it may help to understand that Balzac himself was fixated on the subject of money: he was the first writer to make sure that we all understood the relative financial standing of all his characters. He was also fixated on the social hierarchy of Paris.This novel is widely regarded as one of the best novels ever written. I think I agree. At times, it will exalt you; sometimes it may bring a tear to the eye; the finale may horrify you. But at least you will make the acquaintance of Balzac. If you would like a bit more, I would suggest "Cousin Pons."

If you want to understand Franz Rosenzweig'sThe Star of Redemption (Modern Jewish Philosophy and Religion), then two books will help you along that path: Nahum Glatzer'sFranz Rosenzweig: His Life and Thoughtand this "User's Guide."The "User's Guide" was developed through a series of high-level seminars. Professor Samuelson and a small group of high-level graduate students would meet for one two-hour seminar each week. Consulting the original German and the English translation, they would work together to provide a clear prose explanation of Rosenzweig's meaning -- at least the plain surface meaning. Then Samuelson would go and type the results into his computer, and a mere twenty years later (!!) he was finished.Frankly, I wouldn't have a prayer of understanding "The Star of Redemption" without the guidance of this book, and you may find yourself in the same situation. So far, I have managed to understand that Rosenzweig finds the origin of philosophy in the very human fear of death, and then demonstrates that, by the time of Hegel, that very human fear had been written out of philosophy (at least, Hegel's philosophy) because it was called a "Nothing" rather than a "Something." Schopenhauer and especially Kierkegaard put the vanished individual back in center stage, and then Nietzsche overturned everything by abandoning systematic philosophy and turning philosophy into a matter of his own individual thoughts and feelings.In this process, philosophy lost sight of man, the world, and God.Perhaps not for the faint-hearted, but fascinating reading.

Whoever continues printing this book is dead lazy. Admittedly, it's hard to make a BAD anthology of Greek writing, but 60 years is 60 years, after all: we have learned a lot and there are many excellent new translations.W. H. Auden may not have been the best choice to compile this thing, anyway. Why the heck did he decide to include the entirety of Plato's "Timaeus?" Well, it's a hundred pages, all right.In fact, this collection may rank with Auden's previous "Anthology of Light Verse," which was a real stinker.Auden was a superb poet, but he was not a gifted intellectual. He went to his grave trying to reconcile Christianity and Freudian doctrine. (!!) As his enemies enjoy pointing out, he couldn't even get a "First" at Oxbridge, but had to be content with a "Second."None of this detracts from his wonderful poetry, but I'm afraid he took on a couple of jobs he really didn't have the talent to do correctly.There is an anthology much, much better than this: Michael Grant'sGreek Literature: An Anthology: Translations from Greek Prose and Poetry (Penguin Classics).

What do I mean by a "crossover dictionary?"Well, I have noticed in recent months and years that the CD-ROMs included in dictionaries get an awful lot more use than the dictionaries themselves! I first noticed this with a nifty Thai-English dictionary. The CD version is so much easier to use that it's not even funny. But I looked around my computer and realized that I was doing an awful lot of Google searches for English word definitions, and was not really happy with the results. One example would be the word "flair." I was curious about the word's derivation / etymology, since I was pretty sure there was a French word "flairer" which means "to smell or scent." The on-line dictionaries were no help.Now I have the American Heritage Dictionary on my computer, and it's a LOT more helpful. It's also a lot easier to use than the paper edition, which does weigh 8.2 POUNDS! :-) Note that the CD includes a couple of small freebies (!) --- a big huge thesaurus, and the complete Indo-European dictionary. The words all come with etymologies, and by gum there is that French verb "flairer," as I suspected.Well worth looking at!! Well worth buying!!One note: on my system, which has a lot of free space, the CD install took over 30 minutes. I guess that this is the fault of some really dumb copy algorithm in the installer, but still --- be aware.

I have been reading a lot about mysticism over the past year or two. Living in Thailand, it's hard to avoid the Buddhist tradition of attaining Nirvana through meditation.But, surprisingly, that "old tradition" has been recently brought into question by the well-known Thai forest monk, Buddhadasa, who points out that in the original stories of the Buddha, many people broke through to Enlightenment simply through hearing the truth.In any case, it seems clear to me that there is a world-wide tradition of religious contemplation or meditation which may lead to an ecstatic union with God. Except for Buddhism, where it does NOT lead to any such thing, but to a rather undefined state called "Nirvana."From this presumed fact, the editor of this anthology makes a Great Leap --- and he's not the first one to do it --- and claims that this proves that all religions are the same.I would suggest that this anthology only demonstrates that, for a very small number of people, intense contemplation results in a feeling of ecstasy. Whether this is, in fact, a "union with God" is something that involves a leap of faith. It is reported, for example, that many epileptics have such religious experiences just before they fall into a fit.This is very far from demonstrating that all religions are the same.And here the editor fails, sometimes egregiously. His very brief introduction to Islamic mysticism manages to introduce a Muhammad who (somehow) was not a murderer and a brigand, and who did not marry a great number of wives, one of whom was under ten years old. The Muhammad in this book is a peaceful, profoundly religious man. To which I can only reply: read the Qur'an.The author's biases are also clearly on display in his introduction, where some decent scholarly summary suddenly gives way to preaching right out of Savanarola: if there is not a universal human religious revolution very soon, we will die from environmental disaster. (!) Putting aside the extremely unlikely revolution in religious consciousness, and the equally unlikely environmental disaster, this tirade has absolutely nothing to do with the texts selected by the editor.For example, Saint Francis' beautiful prayer which invokes the beauty of the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, etc. says nothing about the need for a grand "revolution" to protect them; it speaks only of adoring them.------- updated review --------The more time I spend with this book, the more I dislike it. Why?In the section on Buddhism, the editor frankly admits that he does not like some of the key tenets of Buddhism, and so he selectively edits the Buddhist passages based on his own jejune prejudices.The section on the Greeks, which is badly titled "The Way of Beauty" --- "The Way of The Good" would have been much better --- he includes some weird "Hymn to Gaia" which is attributed to a book written by contemporary feminists who imagine they are poets. PLEASE, could we limit the selections to things written by actual Greeks? Or do we see the editor again bending the Greek reality to suit his own jejune tastes, just as he bent the Buddhist reality to suit himself?I'm afraid this book is going in the trash.

This is an outstanding work, something which will grab your attention and make you rethink a lot of your assumptions. In the end, if it hits you as it hit me, it will become one of the rare books you give to friends.It's very hard to summarize, but it may help people to understand some members of the new generation, who say, "I can live without sex, but I can't live without love." Love, and good emotional relationships in general, are simply critical to human happiness.I'll tell you, this made me think back on all the embittered folks I have known who love to say things like, "There is no love" or, perhaps worse, "I don't understand what people say when they use the word 'love,' but I do understand sex." Everyone of those people is a lonely, bitter unhappy man, dragging himself through an empty life, and trying to convince himself that numbers make you happy (number of dollars in the bank, number of sexual encounters, number of expensive toys, etc.) In reality, a loving and supportive network of friends and family can make all the difference.Well, I'll stop. Highest possible recommendation!

I noticed a reviewer who dinged this series because Clark believed in a soul, supposedly. I can't imagine a more trivial and irrelevant comment.I myself was disappointed because Greece and Rome were almost entirely omitted, and so the story of "Civilization" is the story, more or less, of Western European Christian civilization. But what well-educated man wants to be ignorant of that story, or those stories, much less of the amazing works of art, poetry, and architecture created by the Western European Christians?All of these arts are, at their best, superb --- masterpieces. It is, in fact, difficult to imagine what Michelangelo was feeling while he sculpted his "David" --- the most magnificent statue on earth. One side of his soul must have been thinking, "This is Beauty" --- while the other side of his soul writhed in torment when thinking of the teaching of the Catholic Church in regards to "improper love" and (gasp) sodomy.But that is just one point in the history of the triumph of Western civilization. These videos present all of it, or at least as much of it as can be done in 13 50-minute segments.Interestingly enough, this whole series was shot on 35mm FILM. If that film has not been lost or destroyed, it should be used to create a BluRay version of this terrific series --- TV's first masterpiece.

If you are seriously interested in Plotinus, you really want this book. It was put together with special care, by a team of people who cared, and it offers the "best" translation of Plotinus along with scads of footnotes comparing other translations.Since Plotinus is one of the most difficult of all philosophers, you need all the help you can get. THIS book should be your central reference, however.The care extends to the typesetting and the binding. This is a great hardbound book which should last for decades if not centuries.

The book with ISBN 1449557848,The Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso--- with the red and black cover, and the flames --- is absolutely one of the strangest and worst books I have ever seen. Published by some outfit called "Classic Books International," it has an ANONYMOUS translation. Stranger than that, this anonymous translation seems to have been a verse translation but is printed here as PROSE -- but there's more! The initial letters of the verse lines have a Capital Letter which Has Been preserved, so reading the text is a little Bit like reading a ransom Note. There is no preface, no introduction. There are no notes. If I had to guess, I would guess that someone took a free text off the Web and did a slap-dash job of printing it out on paper.The cover is very pretty, which reminds me of that old saying...I just ordered the Mandelbaum translation from Amazon UK. This one is going in the trash.---- Note ------The Mandelbaum translationThe Divine Comedy (Everyman's Library Classics)has arrived, and it is superb.

I think the only serious competition for this book isThai Food, and I would cautiously award the blue ribbon to this book, if only because it contains lots and lots of recipes that I have actually seen and tasted, whileThai Foodseems to have a lot of recipes like "Beef and Mangosteen Soup," which I have never heard of, much less tasted. I suspect that a lot of this may be Royal Thai Cuisine, which is undoubtedly delicious but rather requires a kitchen full of servants.(!)This book, on the other hand, shows you how to cook such everyday items as "Pork Fried Rice" (and their version looks GREAT) plus dozens of other items. In fact, if you know of a Thai dish and cannot find it in this book, that will be a big exception.Full marks for the lovely photographs as well! Just leafing through this wonderful book will make you hungry.

The authors have done a superb job of revealing the lies, fantasies, and willful misrepresentations contained in that awful piece of junk, "The Da Vinci Code."The errors are not minor details. For example, the very idea that that Constantine convened the Council of Nicea to declare Jesus divine is just nonsense. In fact, one of the main reasons for convening the council was to settle a debate concerning the nature of Christ's divinity: was he the SAME AS God (homoousian) or SIMILAR TO God (homoiousian)? Christ's divinity was never in question.By the way, I am not entering this discussion as a Catholic, or even a Christian. I do not think you need to be a Christian to abhor the lie. And "The Da Vinci Code" is just teeming with lies.What else could be wrong here? Well, the whole idea that the "Catholic Christians" kidnapped Jesus from the "Gnostic Christians" is completely backwards!Folks, it really seems that there was a man we know as Jesus. After his crucifixion and death, his disciples, family and other adherents formed the original Christian Church. They were all Jews, and eventually forced by circumstances to leave the Jewish faith. But this original church was formed CENTURIES before the Gnostic movements attempted to capitalize on the popularity of the new faith.Mary Magdalene? A minor character in the Gospels. And, mark you well: despite all of their flaws, the Gospels are the only possible source for the life of Jesus, aside from a few scattered comments in Jewish and Roman sources. Why should Mary Magdalene be raised to the most important person in Christian history?More to the point, who ever dreamed that Jesus MARRIED Mary Magdalene and fathered a child by her?Most of the nonsense in "The Da Vinci Code" goes right back to that awful book, "Holy Blood, Holy Grail." The influence is so obvious that the authors of HBHG actually sued Dan Brown for plagiarism. They lost, on the rather odd grounds that "facts" could not be copyrighted -- as if their book contained any facts!If you want the quick demolition, just read the chapter on the Priory of Sion and Pierre Plantard.The question that arises, for me, is the following one: did Dan Brown actually believe all the nonsense he put into "The Da Vinci Code?" If he did, he was a fool. If he didn't, he was a charlatan.Fool or charlatan, there is no "third option."Believe it or not, one elderly women actually screamed that "The Da Vinci Code" could not have been printed if it was not true! She obviously didn't place a Bible on the table and scream the same thing, I wonder why.Human stupidity and cupidity are endless.This book gets my highest recommendation!

This is a very unusual book. When I first encountered it as a young man, I hastily filed it in the category of "get-rich-quick" books, which I despised. Revisiting it decades later forces me to admit that there must be something to this book.For one thing, glance through the reviews here. There are so many positive reviews which say "This book worked for me," and the negative reviewers basically say, "I read it and I think it's junk" or "I read it and nothing happened." Negative reviews which just say "I read the book" strike me as nearly self-contradictory, because you cannot read this book without realizing that the author himself says, many times, that just "reading" --- processing it through your rational brain --- will accomplish precisely nothing. The book is a blueprint for action, and if you don't take the action yourself, nothing will happen.Still, I know a lot of people who have grown rich without doing any of the advanced practices recommended here. But I have to admit, those people had a lot of the qualities which this book seeks to develop: setting goals, concentrating, and --- perhaps above all --- being persistent and never quitting.Another thing strikes me as curious at the age of 62: I have three brothers, and all four of us have reached the goals we set as children. The goals were very, very different, but it reminds me of the old saying, "Beware of the dreams of your youth, because they just might come true."So there is a lot of valuable stuff in this book. You don't have to make wealth your goal. One of the keys may lie in the question, "What is the meaning of life?" It's a question which needs to be answered, individually, by everyone who does not want to simply drift through life. Once you know your own answer, you may have formulated a Desire (as Hill would say).It should be pointed out, also, that this is NOT a get-rich-quick book. If anything, it is a get-rich-slowly book. And, after all, if you do want to accumulate a few million bucks, don't you think you had better have a definite desire, accompanied by a real-life plan, as well as complete concentration on that plan, and complete tenacity/perseverance? After all, you're going up against competition which may well have all of these! As Napoleon Hill points out, what is truly fanatastic is people who think that this is all going to happen through luck. What's even worse, if it does happen through luck (e.g. winning a lottery): well, how many people hold on to that money and go on to become truly wealthy? Isn't it less than one percent? And how many people win a lottery and subsequently turn up broke again?In sum, I really have only one serious question about the book and its recommended methods, and that is, "Can you fake it?" That is to say, can you take a whim that occurred to you a week ago (say, to become a superb chef) and actually talk yourself into trying to make it happen --- if it is not, in fact, your key goal in life? I don't know, but I strongly suspect that the answer is "No." You'd get tired of chasing your phony goal very quickly indeed, and then you could say that you tried the book's methods, and they failed.So --- before buying this book, do try to figure out what you most want out of life. If it is a great pile of money, you could hardly go wrong here. I think the book could also help in attaining other goals, but the title is not accidental.--- one additional thought ---I have worked as an English teacher for a decade or more, and have been immersed for most of my life in the struggle to learn foreign languages. It is only now that I suspect that the language teacher's focus on repetition is designed to drive the language into the student's "unconscious mind." We understand very little about the human mind, but this struck me as interesting: you speak and hear a foreign language just as you speak and hear your own language --- through some part of your mind which is most certainly not the "conscious mind."Thinking about that, I came to suspect that the idea of auto-suggestion, REPEATED day after day after day, might indeed have some merit.

At least, that has been my experience. A number of conservative Americans hand this book out like popcorn, I'm not quite sure why. Surely the inflation in Weimar Germany was every bit as bad, and also more recent. In fact, there is a good book waiting to be written on "Devastating Inflations Around the World." But -- somehow -- this little book on Fiat Money in France is clasped to the chests of many conservatives.Since the book is, in effect, an argument for the gold standard, I must say that I would find it much more interesting if it forthrightly argued the merits and demerits of the gold standard, rather than simply telling the tale of monetary collapse in revolutionary France. I suspect that the gold standard is not a very good idea, since -- to the best of my knowledge -- no country in the world supports it. The general argument is simple: gold is simply a commodity, like cotton, oil, or oats. Why should we tie the nation's currency to something like one single commodity? If huge gold reserves are discovered in Lower Slobovia, should THAT have any impact at all on the U.S. dollar, or the British pound, or any currency at all?The obvious answer is NO. And the prevailing situation worldwide is that all countries issue "FIAT MONEY." The currency is not tied to any particular commodity, but to a market basket of all the goods and services produced by that country. If you have ten thousand U.S. dollars, you can buy quite a chunk of American goods and services -- including gold, if you're in the mood for some dead "store of value."That's the key issue: all these "fiat" currencies are instantly convertible into gold, or silver, or rubies, or kilowatts. They just are not TIED to the value of any particular commodity.The system works fine. You just have to watch out for idiots like Jimmy Carter, who come to high office with no knowledge whatsoever, and proceed to increase the money supply until inflation reaches 13% and interest rates hit 20%.

Literary masterpieces often come in the most unexpected ways: who would ever have imagined that "The Little Prince" would still be selling (and selling well) in some 30 languages? Similarly, the original publisher of "The Lord of the Rings" felt that he knew two things for certain when he accepted the manuscript. First, it was a modern masterpiece. Second, he was going to lose a bunch of money printing it. Happily, he was wrong about the second point.P. G. Wodehouse is yet another example: who could have imagined that stories about a dim-witted drone and his valet would crack that magic line and ascend into literary immortality? How did that happen?For one thing, Wodehouse was an absolute master of the English language. He could use cliche, and use it artfully, like no other writer. Second, to mention the obvious, he was terribly funny. And third, he was a master of plot and subplot, sometimes managing to bring three or four of them to a satisfactory (and hilarious) resolution within two pages.That's my try at an explanation, but Bertie and Jeeves live on in their imaginary world, and I suspect will continue doing so for a long, long time.Highest recommendation!

I have read and re-read "The Old Devils." Halfway through the re-reading, I suddenly realized why Kingsley Amis was a success. His major strength was his ability to create characters who are both horrible and funny.They may be caricatures, but think about it: "Lucky Jim" has the bizarre, hateful Professor Welch, his two loathsome sons (Bertrand and Michel), and Margaret Peel."Ending Up" is a story of old folks who are not necessarily hateful but extremely strange. There is not a genuinely likeable person among them, excepting only the poor woman who had never been kissed in her life "because of her extreme ugliness.""The Old Devils" is more of the same, with a lot more "people." The four married couples slowly reveal themselves to be more or less hateful (aside from drinking enough to float the Titanic), and the "romantic conclusion" is not convincing.Amis manipulates these caricatures like marionettes. It makes for "black comedy" reading, but it does not make for great fiction.

As Michael Grant explains in his introduction, Cicero's reputation has waxed and waned over the past two thousand years. That reputation was at its zenith at the time of the founding of the United States, and Cicero was like an old friend to Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers. He was admired for many reasons, but perhaps the most outstanding was his concept of Natural Law, which had an enormous influence on the people who wrote the Constitution. And for that reason alone, it's worth getting to know Cicero. Relevant? You can hardly get more than a few pages into "On Duties (III)" before you come across this:"Granted that there is nothing unnatural in a man preferring to earn a living for himself rather than someone else, what nature forbids is that we should increase our own means, property and resources by plundering others."I would guess that the Founding Fathers agreed with this sentiment completely, for the simple reason that once citizens begin plundering one another, one of the primary social goals (living safely and without fear of your neighbor) is instantly destroyed. I would also guess that they didn't write this into the Constitution because it was so terribly obvious: every well-educated man understood Cicero and his concept of Natural Law. But they lived before the advent of Karl Marx...I also suspect that Cicero's "religion" was pretty close to the religion of the Founding Fathers. Cicero imagined the mind of the Universe to be God, while the physical body of the universe was made up by all the natural phenomena around us, and he was quite sure that each one of us carried within himself a spark of that divinity. As far as the afterlife, Cicero basically whittled the possibilities down to two. Either we cease to exist, and cease to feel pain, or there is an afterlife, and we will enter it. In either case, there is no reason to fear death.Another essay included in this book, "On Old Age," is a true Ciceronian classic. If I had my druthers, everyone would receive a free copy on his 60th birthday. It's a simple, short read, and cannot really be summarized in a short review.Another excellent book by Michael Grant!

The Kindle version of this book is not very well-done. It's taken straight from the Gutenberg project and can only be read with the large Kindle turned sideways into landscape mode.There is ANOTHER Kindle edition from Dover which is a heck of a lot better!Check it out yourself: download a sample and see what you get!Now, as for "The Life of Reason" itself, you need to know that this philosophical masterpiece was originally published in five volumes, and that the one-volume version involved (of course) serious re-writing.But where can you find the original five-volume edition?! It's out of print.The Kindle edition from Dover has all five volumes, and it's a great deal. But I grew frustrated at trying to deal with this huge masterpiece on the Kindle, and finally found a bookshop offering the five Dover volumes used (for about $50). If you come to like Santayana, you may well go this route yourself. The Kindle is a great invention, but it's not so hot for constant page-flipping, comparison, and all that. For some things, you will want the actual printed books.

If we first try to judge this mess as a novel, as a work of art, it gets an F. The characters are less than cardboard; Ken Follett (!) tells a better story with better characters. Comparing it with the work of genuine Russian novelists (Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky) is impossible; it's like comparing a broken-down, rusty bicycle with a Boeing 747.Ah, but we hear that "this is not important." (Does that mean that the Philistines have arrived at the party?) What's important are the ideas, the immensely influential ideas.Well, I will grant that this horrible book was enormously influential, but its influence was deadly poison. Chernyshevsky preached a gaggle of bad ideas, from atheistic socialism to man's complete lack of free will. Just that last "idea" alone destroys any possibility of morality, as Dostoevsky memorably demonstrated in his almost universally misunderstoodNotes from the Underground. He later became much more explicit in his novelDemons (Everyman's Library, 182).Naturally, Dostoevsky would have been horrified by this book's subsequent career: it was Lenin's favorite book, which he re-read many times (cf. Martin Amis'Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million). The "Utopian Socialism" which Dostoevsky went to prison for (as a young man), armed with Left Hegelian atheism, did its very best to destroy Christianity in Russia, and, irony of ironies, to establish Russia as an industrial power.If you want to understand the environment from which such deadly political sloganeering arose, I recommend Joseph Frank's biography of Dostoevsky:Dostoevsky: The Seeds of Revolt, 1821-1849, of which this is the first volume. You might want to look into Nabokov'sThe Gift, which contains a short biography of this supremely "giftless" man.

No gay scholar -- in fact, no student of human sexuality -- can afford to be without this massive two-volume masterpiece. The scholarship in these two volumes is nonpareil, the information at times overwhelming. Nothing like this has ever been published. Particularly refreshing is the freedom from cant, advocacy, and gay sloganeering: regard these volumes as the "Nothing but the facts, ma'am" side of gay studies, and you won't go far wrong.Highest possible recommendation!

This is one of the best DVDs I own.Focusing on the 4th Piano Concerto, it is impossible to tell who is playing with more enthusiasm: Zimerman on his magic piano, Bernstein as a superb conductor, or the Vienna Philharmonic as a whole -- all of them enjoying an evening of superb Beethoven, and all of them almost incredibly good. That's one of the great points about the DVD (as opposed to YouTube, where most of this has been posted in mediocre video) -- the expressions on Bernstein's face are priceless.Tragically, Bernstein died the next year, so Zimerman and the Vienna Orchestra recorded the 1st and 2nd concertos with Zimerman conducting.Make no mistake: buy this amazing DVD while it is still available. It is superb.

I just recently decided to go back and review the films of Richard Burton -- at least the ones I liked. The short list includes: Virginia Woolf, Night of the Iguana, and Becket."The Night of the Iguana" comes very close to being a masterpiece. Consider the talent on board: Tennessee Williams for the story, John Huston to write the screenplay and direct, and then: Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, and Deborah Kerr! I regard the casting of Deborah Kerr as particularly brilliant, but the whole film is superbly filmed, and superbly acted.It's an old movie, so you will look in vain for car chases, aliens, and explosions: what it is, is non-stop story from beginning to end. And talk. REAL talk: about God, about life, about the meaning of life. I feel that the film's climax comes when Deborah Kerr explains the meaning of the word "home" to Richard Burton. "Home" is not a place built of bricks and mortar, it is not necessarily a place where procreation takes place, but it is a place where two people can live happily together, sure that they are loved, and that they will never be alone. In the film, Deborah Kerr (Mrs. Jelkes) has built her home with her aged grandfather -- very aged: at 97, he is the world's oldest living and practising poet.But -- what a thought! Ava Gardner is a woman of middle age who has just lost her husband, and is currently seeking solace in the arms of a pair of very handsome, young, and uncommitted beach-boys. Richard Burton, the Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon -- defrocked -- is a man at the end of his rope.Telling you anything more would ruin the film for you. But I have always loved the poem which the aged poet recites towards the end of the film -- to me, it's evidence that Tennessee Williams could write a superb poem, as well as his superb plays.Very high recommendation!

If you are at all like me, you have Sincere Doubts that a tale of mathematics could do anything but put you right to sleep. Well, so much for our preconceptions!! (I know about mine, but am guessing about yours, naturally.)This is an absolutely wonderful book, and you don't need to be a math wizard to enjoy it. Simon Singh does a wonderful job at making you feel that you "sort of" understand the math involved. (Does he cheat? How could I know?? It's like asking me to judge a translation from an Eskimo tongue!)Don't let that fact deter you. You will probably be drawn into this book, willy-nilly, simply by the words which set the scene. One of the world's great mathematicians, Fermat, idly noted in the margin of a book he was reading, that the Pythagorean Theorem (which my father used to recite as "the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sum of the squaws on the other two hides") --- ahem, more formally, Hypotenuse (squared) = (Side1(squared) + Side2(squared)). So what? We all learned this in school.Well, Math Genius M. Fermat scribbled in the margin of his book "This equation only works for the power of two. It does not work for any other number as exponent. I have found a wonderful proof of this theorem, which alas the margin of this book is too small to hold." Then Math Genius Fermat put the book back on his bookshelves, and, sooner or later, gave up the ghost --- without making his claim public. Curious people going through his library, later on, found this outlandish claim and published it. And, slowly but surely, the mathematical world came to realize that Fermat was most probably right --- the equation only worked for the power of two --- but they had no idea at all of how to prove it.Thus was the gauntlet thrown down, to all future ages of mathematicians. And thus was born a really fascinating tale!! All around the world, math experts would chat about "Fermat's Last Theorem," and wonder whether or not it was nonsense, all the while realizing that IF ONLY THEY COULD PROVE IT, they would win lasting fame and, perhaps, mathematical immortality.They all failed. The decades and the centuries rolled by. Amateurs of math began competing for prizes set up by distinguished committees. The mathematical world grew more and more frustrated.In the twentieth century, at last, the problem began to be solved (perhaps!), and the initial crack at the solution came from a totally unexpected place: a couple of Japanese geniuses who had no clue that they were part of the solution to the grand puzzle --- one of them was particularly brilliant and tragic, taking his own life at a young age.I cannot and will not spoil this story any more. But I hope that I have whetted your appetite to find out what really happened. Was the puzzle solved?Read the book and find out!!! :-)

If you want something easier to read, I would suggest Ali Dashti'sTwenty Three Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad. While this is an excellent biography, Muslims are likely to reject it out of hand, as being written by a "heretic." In that case, simply look up the corresponding facts in THIS book, and there you go. This book is accepted as true by all Muslims; it's the closest we have to an original source.Both books provide extensive support for Rep. Allen West's recent statement that "something went wrong" with Muhammad after the flight (hegira) to Medina. Formerly a devout and peace-loving man, something happened. Either he changed, or his true personality appeared, and he turned into a fiercely murderous raider, beginning with "the Nakhla raid," where his men killed three other men guarding a caravan and made off with the entire caravan as loot. Dashti also notes that Muhammad changed abruptly into one of the biggest womanizers in history.Something happened after the flight to Medina, and no one understands exactly why.

This is a wonderful film version of "A Christmas Carol." The sets and visuals are superb, and really plunge the viewer into "Victorian London." George C. Scott gives a terrific performance, one of the best he has ever given us. The story, of course, needs no introduction.My best friend, who is Thai, enjoyed it throughly, and particularly liked the scene towards the end when Cratchit shows up for work EIGHTEEN MINUTES LATE. :-)A great Christmas gift from everyone involved. Thank you!

It is hard to imagine how much grief Allen Young went through to get this book written and published in the 1980's. But he did it, and he gave a huge black eye to Fidel, Che, and their "revolution."Another reviewer "explains" that Castro hated gay tourists coming to Cuba, as if that justified putting gay Cubans into concentration camps. Just recently, Castro himself (in his senility) has pled guilty to all charges.So does that explain why "the new Cuba" of 2010 is a hot spot for gay tourists? There are millions of starving and mistreated people in Cuba, and doubtless there are a lot of good-looking young men among them. If Castro hated gay tourists coming to Cuba in 1960, why is he encouraging them in 2010? Could it just be a question of...money??I guess I'm missing something here, because the whole Cuban "adventure" under Fidel, Che, and Raul looks like unbridled opportunism mixed with exploitation. Plus, of course, a good side-line in pandering, and another side-line in murdering your opposition.

The music is flawless and truly "the sound of angels." The visuals are great, too, since clearly these very talented lads are enjoying themselves giving beauty to others.

There are musicians who believe that perfection in performance is Everything. They will hit every note exactly on time, with exactly the right amount of pianoforte and pedal, and believe that this is the way to a performance masterpiece.The only thing they are missing out on is emotion.In the same way, Nabokov treated the novel as an exercise in performance while writing "Pale Fire." The whole thing is like a gigantic crossword puzzle, waiting for the right genius (or monomaniac) to untangle it. Is Kinbote the fugitive King of Zembla, or not? And, to be rude for a moment, who cares? If Nabokov did not care enough to tell us, but preferred to occupy himself with trivia such as "word golf," then one might well guess that this whole entertaining mess was written by Nabokov as a sort of "anti-Lolita" in his empty afternoons. (It is beyond any doubt that Kinbote has no use for Lolitas of any kind, but has been a devoted fan of handsome young men since he was born.)But, even there, the novel is curiously devoid of emotion.We have become accustomed to taking Vladimir Nabokov at his own estimation, as some sort of Great Artist. In fact, there is an argument to be made that Nabokov slaved away as a college professor until he hit on the idea of writing a piece of "artistic" kiddie-porn ("Lolita"). He really raked in the bucks from that idea, and immediately left the United States to live out the rest of his life in a high-class Swiss hotel.Born an aristo, and died an aristo. Will we still be reading his books in a hundred years?I don't think so.

Borges offers here his highly idiosyncratic views and thoughts about that mysterious thing called poetry.What, after all, really distinguishes poetry from verse? It's like "time" --- everybody understands "time" unless they are asked to define it exactly. In the same way, anyone who loves poetry can recognize it, as they can recognize Very High Verse ("Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?")This book is particularly enjoyable because one suspects, while reading it, that this "amateur" account of poetry is spot-on, leaving many dusty academics far, far behind."Dreaming, when dawn's left hand was in the sky..." What IS IT about that word "left," anyway?? Did you ever think of "rosy-fingered dawn" as having two hands? Would it work if you simply substituted "right hand" for "left hand?"Think about that for a while. The answer seems to be "No." But WHY?Welcome to the world of word-magic!One of the best books ever written on the subject.

For my money, this is one of the funniest movies Hollywood ever made. It starts out funny, and continues funny, right up to the end, when you realize that the good guys have won.The entire cast: magnificent.If you want to sit around feeling glum tonight, DON'T WATCH "RUTHLESS PEOPLE!!!" :-) :-)

Edmund Burke was someone I had hardly heard of two years ago. Then I stumbled across this book and became instantly hooked by two things: the quality of his thought and his impeccable style.Burke supported the American Revolution, and despised the French Revolution, for reasons which should be apparent to any thinking man but are clearly spelled out here. (Just this year, Ann Coulter makes the same case in her new bookDemonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America. If you think her title is going too far, wait until you have read the horrifying and bloody details of what went on in the French Revolution, where it is not too much too say that mobs of men behaved worse than gibbering savages, killing at random and doing unspeakable things to the corpses of the dead.) What is remarkable is that Burke saw all this coming long before the actual arrival of the Great Terror, and he was extremely displeased by some so-called Christians braying from the pulpit that England needed to follow the example of France.If you read this, you may well start looking for more Burke to read. If you have a Kindle, you're in luck. The last time I looked, his complete works were available for less than a buck:The Works of Edmund Burke, all 12 volumes in a single file, improved 8/8/2010.

I admire an author's clever use of words as much as anyone, but there is undoubtedly a point where the clever use of words becomes "mannerism:" the author calls attention to HIMSELF instead of his subject matter.This book fails miserably here. Berlinski seems much more concerned about drawing attention to himself as "the brilliant writer" than about explaining his subject matter with clarity.After all, where did the algorithm come from? A major source may have been cook-books, getting a major boost from Charles Babbage, the symbolic logic of Frege, and finally Turing and the actual realization of the computer.Not recommended.

M. F. K. Fisher is quite probably the person who singlehandedly created her field in the English-speaking world: the art of writing about good food, while simultaneously writing about the art of living.This book, "The Art of Eating," is actually five of her best books issued within one set of covers. My copy is getting dog-eared because I have gone back to it so many times. Fisher writes very well indeed, and her love of life shines through many pages. This is not "just a book about food," any more than "Babette's Feast" is just "a movie about food." The pages overflow with memorable characters -- unforgettable characters!As for the debate about "Eat To Live" versus "Live To Eat" -- which strikes me as an utterly phony debate built on words not life: Fisher simply observes that we all have to eat. As Brillat-Savarin pointed out, the universe is completely boring without its living creatures, and everything that lives must eat. You may choose to drop some protein powder in a blender with an egg and some milk, gulp that down and call it breakfast: others would carefully poach that egg and happily eat it with toast and cafe au lait. Fisher's main argument would be that intelligent people should know how to turn the inevitable time of eating into a time of pleasure, not choking down barbecue with standard-issue American bread and Dr. Pepper.And this point of view, to enjoy the pleasures of the world without simply lapsing into hedonism -- to understand the glorious rapture of peas freshly harvested, and instantly cooked, served with fresh farm butter and salt -- informs all the rest of her life, including her two marriages (to Al and to Chexbres). The marriage to Chexbres turned out to be the love of her life, and then suddenly everything went terribly wrong -- at the same time the Nazis were taking over Germany, Chexbres came down with a terminal illness. After living through that hell, Fisher awoke to discover that she was alone.She dealt with it. She described it, unforgettably. And in these stories of real life, lived on the edge, the volume sold as "The Art of Eating" truly becomes something that could be called "The Art of Living."This is simply one of the best books I have ever read in my life.

This is a fascinating film acted to perfection. Somehow we have come to expect these things from Clint Eastwood, who has certainly had one of the more fascinating film careers ever. Do we remember "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and the other Italian westerns?I think Eastwood simply took a gamble with this film "Hereafter." He had an excellent screenplay which cried out to be made, so he just went and made a film. Like almost everything he touches, the acting in the film was golden.He may even have had the idea that we need to think a bit more about "the hereafter" -- about life after death. There are, after all, hundreds of people who have had Near-Death Experiences (NDEs), and yet no one seems at all comfortable discussing these things.

Thousands of novels are published every year, and the vast majority wind up remaindered and pulped. Not this one! This book is well-nigh unforgettable, a unique coming-of-age story that happens in two utterly different worlds.The first world is a typical high-school, where the young (14yo?) protagonist does all the usual high-school things.The second world is the rarified world of search for musical excellence. Our young hero lives in Darwin, and the only decent piano teacher in Darwin happens to be an Austrian refugee who once was one of the best concert pianists in the world.To say anything more would spoil the story, so I won't. I'll just say that you may not enjoy this book if classical music bores you stiff. It's a fascinating tale of the growing relation between master and pupil.Very well-written, and highly recommended!!-----------Further thought----------------This could be made into a wonderful film.

Not only is this DVD educational, it comes with an (optional) examination and a reference library as bonus features.Where "Darwin's Dilemma" explored the Cambrian Explosion and the problems it poses for Darwinian Evolution, this DVD focuses on the idea of irreducible complexity, as illustrated by the bacterial flagellum (a truly remarkable item) as well as the inner workings of the cell producing proteins from DNA instructions. The underlying question is "Where did life come from?" As Dobzhansky memorably pointed out, life did not "evolve" from non-living matter: "Prebiotic evolution is a contradiction in terms."There are a huge number of questions which evolutionary theory cannot answer, and the biggest one is exactly this: the origin of life. Darwin didn't have a clue, and said so, although he made some silly speculations about a primordial soup. I use the word "silly" because, in Darwin's day, nobody had any idea what the cell was like inside, so they labelled the putative contents "protoplasm" and imagined it as some sort of organic goo. Nothing could have been more mistaken, and you'll see exactly how wrong this idea was in this DVD, which may well contain amazing and beautiful things that you have never seen before. As far as I can tell, the presentation is 100% factual, and the opinions of the various scientists are simply their opinions. But: which came first, proteins or the cell? The man who wrote "Biological Predestination" reports his own perplexity, when he realized that he had to (a) explain how DNA came into existence or (b) explain how proteins came into existence without DNA. He could do neither. In behaving this way, he acted scientifically: if the data conflict with your theory, then you need to get yourself a new theory. It is of no use to quote some courtroom judge on these issues: judges can be as biased as anyone. The best way is to look at the evidence for yourself and draw your own conclusions.For myself, I find it impossible to view the wonderful, extraordinarily complex nanotechnology at work inside the cell and believe that it's all chance. The origin of DNA can hardly be the result of natural selection, because you need DNA in order to HAVE natural selection.A beautifully done piece of work, fascinating to watch, which should have a very wide audience.(Note: I am not a follower of any religion.)

The PBS / Great Performances crowd did a super job of capturing this live performance on video -- and what a performance it is! Andrea Bocelli sings his heart out, and there isn't a bad song to be found anywhere. On the contrary, many of the performances are thrilling: "Amazing Grace" and a few others brought tears to my eyes. The audience reaction shots show that they were just as thrilled.If you love music, you want this DVD!

I've peeked at the one-star reviews and a number of them call this DVD "religious propaganda." This is mostly nonsense. We've all seen propaganda (a lot of it in advertising) and this DVD is not that. As a matter of fact, it does not even state a conclusion, although it presents a fascinating argument for the presence of non-human intelligence in the universe. This does not strike me as a horrible, biased fundie thing to do. We are still allowed to discuss scientific theories, are we not?It's odd, but in this particular discussion, the ones who strike me as completely close-minded are the evolutionist fundies. I have some theories about why that might be, but you don't want to hear about that.This DVD is about the Cambrian Explosion, an event which Darwin himself found deeply troubling, because it contradicts his concept of the "tree of life" --- where everything evolves out of the first primitive life-form, and species gradually differentiate and separate. The problem is that the fossil record does not look anything at all like that. Fully-formed animals in a bewildering variety suddenly appear in the Cambrian, apparently out of "nowhere." (I will note, as an aside, that the universe pulled the same stunt, appearing suddenly out of nowhere.)There are many serious implications to this, as Darwin himself pointed out: the sudden appearance of fully-formed animals would kill his theory dead, and he said so.Aside from all that, the DVD is just beautiful and extremely well-made. You'll probably learn a lot from it, and enjoy it, even if you disagree with the argument which is gradually developed.It's curious: my doctor brother also feels that Darwinism is on its last legs. I think I agree, and neither one of us is religious, although I think about Theism quite a bit these days. :-)There's a suggestion to watch this on YouTube. Go ahead if you like, but playing this DVD on a big flat-screen TV is a real treat.

The review above is excellent, and I just wanted to add one point. Aside from language evolution, Bickerton makes one point that philosophers should be paying attention to. The question is how we get from sense perceptions to words, and Bertrand Russell for one got this wrong. He imagined that words map directly to sense perceptions, and got into huge philosophical trouble. The truth is apparently a bit more complex. We humans (and other beasts) have what might be called a "sensory subsystem," which senses the outside world and hands us a "concept." In the case of a frog, for example, the concept of "bug" produces appropriate catch-the-bug behavior. In the case of humans, the concept "bug" gets mapped onto the word for "bug" (which would be "malang" in Thai, "insecte" in French, etc.) So, in Bickerton's view, our words map to "concepts," which in turn map to sense perceptions.This may seem to be similar to quarreling over angels dancing on the head of a pin, but in fact it is a huge difference, and would be directly relevant to anyone who wanted (say) to make computers speak English.

A number of reviewers have complained that this book does not present all sides of the debate about Christianity. All I can say is: read the title. The book is not called "The Christ Debate," but "The Case for Christ." Since I have read tons of anti-Christian and atheist material, this book was actually rather refreshing -- letting the other side speak, and speak in full. The author brings up many of the standard problems (and some new ones) and they are satisfactorily answered.There were a couple of surprises for me. First, Christianity is based on a much firmer documentary basis than Mormonism: not one archaeologist has found any of the cities mentioned in "The Book of Mormon" -- and, I would add, the entire idea of the American Indians being the descendants of a lost tribe of Israel was exploded long ago. (It is by now common knowledge that American Indians are of Asiatic stock, entering the New World via the iced-over Bering Strait.)Second, I had never realized what a self-serving, put-up job the so-called "Jesus Seminar" was. It was just a meeting of the most left-wing theologians in existence, which BEGAN with the guiding idea that Jesus was NOT the Son of God. Pretty strange Christians, if you ask me!The author conducts over a dozen interviews with extremely intelligent and learned scholars, which I found quite interesting. A lot of 19th-century German scholarship has been shown to be problematic.In any case, an interesting & challenging read!

This book tries to make the case that "homosexuality" can be "cured." I am not sure that the author is aware that the Kinsey Institute still holds a $5,000 cash reward for the first substantiated case of a change in sexual orientation.Aside from that: although the author claims expertise, I am not sure that he can do elementary arithmetic. Let's try some: in very round numbers, there are 6 billion people on the planet, which gives us 3 billion males. The lowest estimate of the incidence of male homosexuality is around 2 percent, while the highest estimate is 10 percent. That means there are somewhere between 60 million and 300 million gay men on the planet. That is to say, the low estimate gives us the population of France, while the high estimate gives us the population of the USA.Now, even if you grant the absurd premise that sexual orientation can be "cured," just how many "caregivers" would it take to "cure" 150 million people, with more being born every minute?Sounds like a bid for permanent employment to me, plus an attempt to put another clamp on that pesky thing, human freedom.

Paul Johnson has written an excellent short life of Napoleon, a man whose mind almost nobody claimed to understand. They could see his actions, his plans, his plots & counterplots, but no one seemed to understand how his brain worked.Johnson notes Napoleon's unbelievable military talent: he could and did write the orders for the troops (and their logistical support!) for a battle ten days away, in detail, in a matter of hours. He was a strategic and tactical genius, with one fatal flaw: his motto "L'audace! Toujours l'audace!" enabled him to strike like a cobra when on the attack, but he was simply incapable of fighting a defensive war, or a war of attrition. In the end, the Duke of Wellington, who had faced the French Army many times before, could say, "The French attacked in their usual way, and we beat them back in the usual way."Napoleon's historical standing has been puzzling: at the time of his death, he was almost universally detested as a man who made peace impossible. He had slaughtered millions and looted dozens of banks and capital cities, yet he had completely failed to "spread" democracy in Europe. When he died, there were kings all over Europe, and in France as well. It was particularly hard for him to "spread" democracy because France had no democracy to spread! The Revolution gave way to The Terror, which gave way to Napoleon, the First Consul who made himself Emperor. Some democrat! Perhaps I should add that he despised the Parisians, and the French in general, and his opinion of other nations was even worse.Yet, paradoxically, he was no sooner dead and buried than the French went to work, rehabilitating him with enthusiasm. What is even stranger is that other European countries such as England and Germany joined in this effort, so that there was a Napoleonic Legend as great as the legend of Alexander the Great. This legend of the Grand Tyrant came in rather handy for some of the slave-drivers of the twentieth century.I would bet fairly good money that Paul Johnson would have loved to include a final chapter comparing and contrasting the careers of George Washington and Napoleon. Washington left a lasting legacy: a functioning, democratic government, and refused a third term in office, having no desire for political power as such. Napoleon did just about the opposite: he sought political and military power at every opportunity --- in fact, the word "opportunist" might have been coined just for him --- and left nothing but chaos as his legacy.Well, that's not quite right. By the time Napoleon was done with Europe, his brand of French nationalism had awakened nationalism in every other European country. Nationalism, rather than royalty, became the new force driving history. But it appears that this was something that happened purely by accident, and was no part of Napoleon's planning.A very high recommendation!By the way, for an excellent description of the extraordinary welcome given to the first Napoleonic armies invading Italy, read the opening pages of "The Charterhouse of Parma." The simple explanation is that the fun-loving Italians had been living under the dour rule of the Spanish for 100 years, "and they had been bored for a hundred years." :-)A much more sardonic view is Byron's "Ode on Napoleon Bonaparte," which makes pitiless fun of Napoleon failing to die with his boots on, and accepting a coward's refuge in St. Helena.

I have little doubt that Oscar Wilde and Bosie had extraordinary sexual adventures, but one little thing keeps coming back to me: early in this book, the author identifies Ganymede as the Trojan boy whom Zeus abducted and "anally raped."What was that? Was there a source for that? I flipped to the back of the book, and of course there was no source. It was apparently "just something the author heard on good authority."I have been involved in gay scholarship for decades and have read dozens of books about Ancient Greece, and this book is absolutely the first place that I have read about Zeus' alleged anal rape of Ganymede.I will say one thing with absolute certainty: there is no Ancient Greek source which supports the author. Centuries later, getting into Medieval and Renaissance Europe, there may well have been all sorts of tales about Ganymede. He had passed into the popular language: men referred to a handsome boy as some other man's "Ganymede," and from this we ultimately get the word "catamite."But the actions of the Great God Zeus? He changed himself into an eagle and abducted Ganymede to Mount Olympus to serve as his wine-pourer. Period.Now, this one little thing may seem to be just that: one little thing. But this book about Oscar Wilde is full of details. And if the author is not trustworthy on the details, then one must wonder about the value of this book.Not recommended.

After reading the first few chapters of this book, I was forced to change my mind about a number of things. Just one of them was the old question: "Did the United States finance Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan?" For years, I gave the "Richard Miniter Answer": "No, the US only gave money to the Afghan nationals, not to the foreign Arab warriors." After reading Friedman, I tend to think that: Yes, this answer is "correct," but only if you fall for the window dressing. Saudi Arabia financed the Arab mujahideen, yes. But it did so while hand-in-glove with the USA: the two countries were allied in trying (successfully) to create a quagmire for the USSR. It began with the Peanut Farmer, and was intensified under Reagan. And it worked!The problem was that, typically enough, once the USSR collapsed, we "lost interest" in our former allies and simply abandoned them in Afghanistan. Of course, there may have been some not-so-subtle prodding from Arab regimes (such as Egypt, S.A., and Morocco) to do just that.Also VERY interesting: 9/11 was not really "all about America." The target was the Arab states just mentioned. Al Qaeda was attempting to provoke the United States into a massive attack on the Arab world as a whole, leading to a pan-Arab Islamic revolution in which the U.S. would simply have been a patsy.It didn't work. And understanding the strategy of Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, Bill Clinton suddenly seems a lot less "lackadaisical." Like all American presidents, he was stuck with a dilemma. If we don't do ANYTHING, Americans will hate us. If we attack the Arabs, we've just been played for suckers. Clinton chose an "in-between" strategy of "ineffective response."This book is a cram course in current geopolitics, and it is excellent. I would feel a lot more comfortable if the author were our National Security Advisor, or Secretary of State.The usual ending: "everyone should read this book." But with a special note: "especially the 'Truthers'." This book lays it all out in open view, and shows exactly how the 9/11 hijackers came mostly from Saudi Arabia, but did not represent the WILL of the Saudi Arabian government.No: they were trying to overthrow the Saudi Arabian government.As a result, one comes to view the attempted charitable gift of $10 million from a Saudi royal to NYC in a very different light. Mayor Rudy was "right" to follow his guts and refuse the gift, but, like almost everyone else, he did not understand what had just happened. The Saudi royal quite likely did, and so one of the strangest moments of modern history suddenly becomes a whole lot clearer.By the way, this book only takes the story to 2004, where the author quite rightly calls the war undecided, although looking bad for Al Qaeda. If you want the rest of the story, you'll need to look at a book like "The Gamble."One of the best books I have ever read!

I would not be surprised if this book turned out to be pure bunkum; America never seems to lack for people seeking to start a new religion.The opening of the story strikes me as hard to believe: that a tourist was basically left to die in the biggest and best hospital in Paris.Be that as it may, the real bunkum smell began to be unavoidable when Jesus and the angels were explaining God's future plans for humanity to Rev. Storm. Parts of it came right out of Karl Marx, while other parts came right out of the Disney cartoon "Pocahontas." In the future, you see, we'll all commune with magical plants, which will grow and bear fruit instantly under our psychic influence. And we'll eat that food without cooking it, and travel to distant galaxies without lifting a single pinkie. We'll all live in multicultural little compounds, where there will be zillions of different languages --- even though we communicate telepathically, without language. Yes, you read that right: there will be zillions of totally useless languages, and totally different cultures (all good), and we'll do everything collectively. In the evenings, we will sit with the children and sing "Kumbaya" after our dinner of raw squash, grapefruit, raspberries and mangos. Oh, we'll get along in peace with the animals, too, including the grizzlies, the wolverines, the hyenas and the jackals. (Can you say "Pelagian heresy?")And America will change its selfish, imperialistic ways, or die! You see, the book was published in the year 2000, right before 9/11 and the very visible rise of Islamic terrorism, so America was still the source of all evil in the world.I won't go on. The book is nonsense. Emmanuel Swedenborg may be more hilarious; it's hard to judge. But it's not enough just to state that the book bears no resemblance to Christianity; it bears no resemblance to any known religion --- always excepting "the Rev. Storm religion."

What do YOU think about 9/11?Do you think it was a plot laid by Bush or the Israeli Secret Service (MOSSAD)? Would you like to have more information on the subject?Would you like a six-hour TV docudrama that meticulously traces the path to 9/11?Well, you can't have it. (Or at least you were not allowed to have it until very recently.)This DVD ("Blocking the Path to 9/11") is an excellent explanation of exactly what happened to a $40 million docu-drama which happened to rub some Washington fat-cats the wrong way, and how they trampled all over the First Amendment to prevent you from seeing it.This is, as far as I can tell, the first major indictment of the corrupt media and the corrupt politicians acting hand-in-glove together.It's excellent, and very much worth your time.

G. K. Chesterton excelled at "turning the world upside down." It is pretty well-known that his research for this biographical essay was pretty spotty: he scanned a couple of books (or three) and then sat down to write his own book, which SOMEHOW stands as simply the best biographical essay of the man ever written.Like most of Chesterton's books, it's a joyful book. While paying close attention to Thomas, he also enjoys "turning the world upside down."What world could that be? Let me offer a description, somewhat exaggerated."The genius of Ancient Greece shone but dimly in the Roman Empire, and, following the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe entered the Dark and Middle Ages, from which it was only saved by the Renaissance."No, says Chesterton --- and he pays attention to some details, such as Plato and Aristotle. The genius of Ancient Greeece did indeed find its first flower in the philosophy of Plato, but Plato was decisively corrected by Aristotle. The Roman Empire came and went, and the new religion of Christianity became, over the centuries, extremely neo-Platonic and Augustinian. When Thomas Aquinas was born, the forces of Augustine and neo-Platonism represented the Conservative Old Order. Thomas Aquinas took on those old fogies and (almost singlehandedly) made Christianity pay serious attention to Aristotle. This happened long before the "Renaissance" and might well be called simply "The Birth" of a stupendous new universal philosophy which remains vibrantly "relevant" to the present day.The idea that Thomas Aquinas' "Summa" represents the most complete and satisfactory explanation of the human condition -- well, that's pretty revolutionary!

In one corner, an American "bourgeois" woman named Georgie Anne Geyer. In the opposite corner, Fidel Castro. The opening bell rings! :-0If I understand the "leftist" mindset at all well, there is no decision to be made here. Castro is right, and Geyer is wrong, and that ends that.But -- unfortunately for that mindset -- Georgie Ann Geyer worked really hard in compiling her book, and conducted interviews with hundreds of people, and she knows an awful lot more about Fidel Castro than he knows about her. She knows that Castro was a killer, even in his university days. She knows that he was an absolutely ruthless seeker-of-power, like some others we have known (Lenin, Hitler, Mussolini...)And, in his quest for absolute power, Castro was helped by another thing, not much discussed here. This was the idea that the current system is so corrupt, that anything else would be an improvement. We citizens of the planet Earth need to be very wary of ideas like this. For example, in Iran: the idea that the Shah had to go, that anything else would be an improvement. BZZT! WRONG! Thirty years of terrorist mullahs certainly put a big damper on that idea!In the same way, the Cubans of long ago partied and had good times and never really dreamed that anyone could be worse than Batista. Of course, sooner or later, they woke up to the fact that they were being ruled by a thug who would never relinquish power, and who would creep into his senility crowned by Forbes magazine as one of the richest men in the world. Oh, that hero of the people, that secretive billionaire Fidel Castro! How could anyone fail to kiss his beard, and declare him the savior of mankind?Geyer does not have the whole story here: she cannot (given the date of publication) quite cover all of the damage done to Cuba. But in the time of that evil "fascist" Batista, Cuba was an economic marvel: its workers were ranked #8 in the world in terms of wages received, among many other things. Nowadays, Cuba battles it out with Burma for the honors of "most godforsaken country."And to think: it is still a "fashion item" to wear images of Che Guevara, whose main ability was shooting prisoners -- in prison. Thousands of them! Fidel's Grand Executioner, and we strut around wearing his image, for what reason?The best biography of this [expletive deleted]. I really hope that Cuba will come back to the real world, and soon!

Isaac Newton was not your every-day guy. He may have become disillusioned with humanity in his childhood, but then again he may have never been interested in other people. He spent the first forty years of his life (more or less) in constant, solitary study.It is by now obvious that Newton was a genius of the same caliber as Mozart, da Vinci, Shakespeare, etc. But he was unique in his solitude. He did not want human companionship. He was totally absorbed in the world of mathematical ideas, as well as the world of alchemy and Bible scholarship (where he became a silent heretic, subscribing to the Arian heresy which the Roman Emperor Constantine so disliked).So he spent decades shut in his room, mostly at Trinity. He revolutionized mathematics, optics, and our understanding of gravity & the solar system. He did it, mostly, all by himself, buying the key books and studying them until they gave up their sometimes cryptic contents (e.g. Descartes' "Geometry.") He discovered and invented a lot of things, including the calculus (!), and kept most of it secret. He hated publishing his work because it would involve him in disputes with morons.And he utterly changed our understanding of the universe. It has been remarked that the history of math can be divided into two parts: before Newton, and after Newton --- and the second part is by far the greater part.James Gleick has done a wonderful job of presenting this unique human being to the modern world, and I recommend it very highly.

This Everyman edition, edited by Peter Washington, for some reason omits almost all of Hardy's most well-known and admired poems!NOT in this edition: Channel Firing, The Convergence of the Twain, Nature's Questioning, A Confession to a Friend in Trouble, Her Death and After, Are You Digging on my Grave, The Ruined Maid, Hap, The Impercipient, and A Broken Appointment. All of the Wessex Poems are missing, as well.I can't see what possible harm would have been done by including these poems! As it is, you're better off with the Dover edition -- this cannot be your only collection of Hardy poems, because the editor left out all the good stuff!

What strikes me as kind of funny is that I would like to frame this review as "take a step back from the current political chaos, and listen to a voice of wisdom from long ago." I still think this is a great idea, but have to admit that Cicero managed to produce the bulk of his writing just at the time when he was in the midst of enormous political chaos --- and family tragedy.Somehow, he managed to turn out a whole bunch of fascinating writing, particularly dealing with the question, "Is moral goodness enough to give us a happy life?" This, I think, is a deceptively simple question, and it brings to mind all sorts of scenarios: going into the slave trade to make your millions, and then retiring to have nightmares for the rest of your life, or perhaps: what should you do when you find your parents have died and all of your siblings have turned into Greed Machines and are ready to fight on for years in the courts over every last stamp in Dad's stamp collection? I know at least one couple who simply withdrew from the Greedfest, and I suspect that they were much happier than their relatives.Finally, I think a good acquaintance with Cicero is a magnificent thing for an American citizen. I must say, I find it absolutely impossible to even imagine Pelosi and Reid reading this book; they are quoted as being completely busy "wining and dining" their big donors in Pacific Heights. But perhaps this is one place where Joe Citizen can steal a march on them! :-)Good stuff here!

I suspect that fans of John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee all had a period when they ignored the recommendations of friends & family, a period which abruptly ended when they actually sat down and began READING a Travis McGee yarn.This one is a classic, for many reasons which can't revealed without spoiling the story. But the story itself is very well plotted: you will find yourself just as bewildered as McGee as he tries to figure out the wheels within wheels within wheels...The final discovery of the real villain is completely satisfying, and may well make you reach for yet another McGee yarn, after a decent rest-break, of course.You know, somebody could have a lot of fun turning these into a series of TV movies....

I am not sure about the previous reviewer's Thai friend, who said that some of the Thai in this course was incorrect. I've been through the course a hundred times, and never found such a thing.It now seems that the Linguaphone is "old generation," and that the Pimsleur method is sweeping the deck. But the Pimsleur method, as good as it is -- which is very good -- moves slowly. To help you imagine this slowness, in the "English for French Speakers" course, the pronouns "he" and "she" are introduced in Lesson 19!More than that -- when you have finished your Pimsleur Level I Thai Course -- what next? Does the Pimsleur course teach Thai reading and writing very well? No, it does not. Does the Linguaphone course teach reading and writing? Yes, it does, superbly.Again, it's a little old. Lesson 1 contains the word "secretary." Are they still around? But "businessmen" and "drivers" surely are.And a lot of people have learned Thai from this course alone!!

I considered calling this book a rewriting of history, but the more I read of it, the more it seemed like the much more complex task of "writing history," something which really has not been done for the period under discussion (Western Europe from 200 AD through 1000 AD).Peter Brown is an eminent historian, and for good reason. He reads widely, and he has good eyes and an excellent brain. His history of "The Rise of Western Christendom" upsets multiple historical cliches, the most famous perhaps being Edward Gibbon's boast that he had described "the triumph of barbarity and religion." One can understand how Gibbon came to this conclusion, but Peter Brown can describe what actually happened. There is a huge difference.I'll give you one example of my own historical goof, when I wrote the following:"In December of the year 406, a bitter winter chill enabled hordes of barbarian warriors--some 15,000--to walk with their horses, wives and children across the Rhine River. Once across the river, they plundered and destroyed at their leisure, seizing the city of Rome four years later."This is entirely wrong. The "barbarians" were coming under attack from Attila and his Huns, and so they wrote to Rome for permission to cross the river in self-defense. The Romans consented, only requiring that the new refugees accept military service.This sensible policy ended in disaster: famine broke out, and the refugees resorted to raiding the local farms for food to eat. In the end, they finally attacked Rome itself. But it was not a deliberate and planned invasion. Like so much in human history, it was something that "just happened."That is just one sample of the erudition on display in this wonderful book. To the best of my knowledge, it has no serious competition.I should note that Peter Brown gives good attention to the expansion of Christianity in the East, and that he was so dedicated to the truth about this era that he revised the original book and issued a second edition only seven years after the first edition appeared.Why? Because discoveries about this era are suddenly pouring in at a huge rate.This is your go-to book for the era. Period.

Original review posted 2005; now we are approaching 2010.----------------------------Ray Kurzweil is a genius, no doubt. But geniuses are not always right, which should not surprise anyone. Henry Ford was a world champion at building cars, and a total crackpot about the Jews. Ray Kurzweil created the software for some of the best keyboards ever made, AND he made big contributions to speech-recognition.But, somehow, in this book, he manages to confuse software with hardware.Everybody involved with computers knows that the hardware is improving at a Very Satisfactory Pace. Software? Hmmm... Software has to be written by human beings....Rather than talk more blather about the Singularity, I will just pose this question --- let's call it a MicroTriumph. What kind of a machine could perform the MicroTriumph Test?THE TEST: Place a poodle before the machine, and ask "Is this a dog or a cat?" The machine must answer correctly, or fail. Then ask, "What color is this dog?" Again, the machine must answer correctly, or fail. Repeat the experiment with various animals. As a finale, put a boy or a girl in front of the machine, and ask it whether this is a boy or a girl.I think most people involved in AI will realize that this is an INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TASK. It's a very good example at what computers do very poorly --- and what people do "without thinking." In order to pass the "MicroTriumph Test," a company will literally have to spend billions and billions of dollars --- not on the CPU, mates, but on the peripherals and the software.Gee, it's 2009 already. All those who feel that their computers have become noticeably "smarter" in the last 9 years, raise your hands. (No! No Vista victims!) :-)

This sprawling novel may put many readers off: all of the main characters seem to live in some sort of mental torment. All of their decisions are conflicted , and this makes the characters hyper-real, in some sense.Welcome to the Karamazov Family! The "patriarch," a drunken, miserly lecher with no redeeming qualities, has managed to produce four sons via three mothers. Dmitri, brother #1, is what the Thai would call "100 percent male," loaded with testosterone and continually in trouble with women: an ex-soldier whose motto would be "Eat, Drink and be Merry" if he could only figure out the "Be Merry" part. Ivan, brother #2, is the intellectual, college-educated and austere. Alyosha, brother #3, is the baby of the family and everyone's favorite: his is the life of the Spirit, and he enters the story dressed as a monk. Brother #4 is the unacknowledged bastard, Smerdyakov, the daughter of the town madwoman "Stinking Lisaveta," whom the lecherous father must have taken advantage of at sometime in the past. Smerdyakov is a misanthropic narcissist, to say the least.The novel begins by introducing us to these powerful characters and their conflicts --- almost incredibly, the lecherous patriarch, Fyodor, is locked in a conflict with his oldest son, Dmitri, over a woman of dubious virtue, Grushenka. And the story continues to be interesting, until suddenly Ivan, the second son and the "intellectual," opens his mouth and...delivers. The two chapters where Ivan unburdens his soul, "Rebellion" and "The Grand Inquisitor," are quite likely to sear themselves into your memory forever. "Rebellion" is a heart-rending description of "the problem of Evil" for the Christian faith, and "The Grand Inquisitor" --- well, you need to read this for yourself. What I find remarkable is that Dostoevsky, clearly a man of faith, somehow summoned the courage and honesty to write the most damning criticisms ever leveled at Christianity. These criticisms are followed by long chapters on the Elder Zosima, which are very moving discussions of God and Faith.Alyosha, naturally, is the man in the middle. He respects Ivan, but he loves his Elder.As you turn the pages, this entrancing novel of faith and ideas suddenly turns into an absorbing murder mystery. I don't think I'll spoil anything by saying that the creepy patriarch, Fyodor, winds up dead at the hands of...who??So, fasten your seat-belts and enjoy the ride.

It's probably safe to say that most Americans have never heard of Franz Rosenzweig. I surely hadn't, until I came across his name multiple times in books by David Goldman (How Civilizations Die: (And Why Islam Is Dying Too), andIt's Not the End of the World, It's Just the End of You: The Great Extinction of the Nations). In the latter book, Goldman goes so far as to recommend reading Rosenzweig and putting his own book in the recycle bin.Rosenzweig is known primarily for his early masterpiece,The Star of Redemption (Modern Jewish Philosophy and Religion), which is extremely tough reading. It has been described as a graduate course in philosophy and theology.Enter Glatzer's introduction, which at least makes it possible to begin understanding this man, who may well be one of the intellectual and spiritual titans of the last century. I find that the more of Rosenzweig I read, the more I want to know. David Goldman is a brilliant man in his own right, and he spent a number of years studying Rosenzweig.Just to whet your appetite a bit: Rosenzweig is one of the very few thinkers I have come across who regards both Judaism and Christianity as true and valid religions. He describes the differences between them, but is convinced that both can and do lead to a knowledge of God and redemption. Another thought of his: writing is better than reading, writing poetry is better than plain writing, and living life is better than writing poetry. That's one of his biggest points: don't get lost in the words and the books; we are called to live life according to God's love for us.This book is a terrific accomplishment.

This is a classic of Stoic philosophy, and it is quite close to Buddhism in its insistence on renouncing the pleasures and pains of the world. It is interesting reading -- up to a point.Just as a thought experiment: if you invited Marcus to a Thanksgiving dinner, would he participate happily in the feast? Or would he confine himself to a few slices of white meat, with a dour expression showing his disapproval of the feasting idiots? How would he conduct himself at a New Year's Eve party?Consider the idea that renouncing the world amounts to renouncing life, and that this is no solution at all for the mass of men. More than that, the Stoic renunciation brings no obvious reward (other than moral perfection and, perhaps, a reputation as a prig), while the Buddhist renunciation at least offers the hope of Nirvana.For the average man, it seems quite enough to live a good life and enjoy the pleasures of life when they are available. In fact, the Jewish tradition explicitly condemns those people who only eat a few slices of white meat during a Thanksgiving feast.

In this vastly informative (and neglected) book, we are called to see the "real" Gandhi.Now, while seeing the "real" anyone may be a very difficult task, the author's task is made much, much easier by contrasting his "real" Gandhi with the "movie" Gandhi. And Grenier rightly begins by noting that the "movie" was hardly impartial: it was financed by millions from the Government of India and (of course) produced by a fanatical British leftist.Now, would you expect an impartial treatment from such sources?Would you expect to learn that our "pacifist" Gandhi served in the British Army as a Sergeant-Major?Would you expect to learn that Gandhi was a fanatical Hindu who believed that the Gujariti caste polluted at 70 meters?Would you expect to learn that Our Divine Master Gandhi was in fact a political and economic idiot? (His advocacy of home spinning speaks volumes in itself.)By the way, to be rude, have you ever read anything written by Gandhi, such as "Hind Swaraj?" In that book, compounding his usual stupidities, Gandhi tells us all that India will return to its original perfection once it carries out two simple tasks: get rid of the railroads, and banish the doctors.That "banish the doctors" theme played an important part in Gandhi's own home life. When his wife fell ill, Gandhi refused to let her be "murdered" by those "doctors," with their penicillin shots and all.She died.A few years later, when Gandhi himself became seriously ill, what did he do?Well, he checked himself into the best British hospital in town.Now, aside from inciting his fellow Hindus to massacre Indian Muslims, I would have to admit that this was one helluva guy. I especially liked his practice of sleeping with naked teenage girls, and asking all of his disciples whether they had had a good bowel movement.Truly, truly, a guiding light for humanity.

Well, I must admit that "Dr. No" is the weakest of the three, but "From Russia With Love" and "Goldfinger" may well be classic movies.Of course, current movie-goers have no idea that these films even exist. They are all interested in James Bond flick #47, for about 15 nanoseconds. They have no clue that the whole series was kicked off by one of our greatest actors (Sean Connery), who finally asked to be released from the Bond routine because he felt he had other stuff he could do. (A hearty "yes!" from those who love "The Name of the Rose!) But don't trust me...just wander off to IMDB and have a look at his filmography.While you're there, you might have a peep at the filmography of Robert Shaw, who did an outstanding job in "From Russia With Love."These three movies are classic, unlike most of the Bond dreck which followed.

Perhaps the most terrifying statement I have read in my life comes in footnote #2 to the Introduction of this magisterial work:"In September 2000 I asked a class of over 300 students (at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, campus where I taught) how many of them had learned anything about repression in Communist countries in high school. Not one hand was raised. I also asked how many had heard the word "Gulag" --- four of them had."So: Communism produced 100 million corpses, and the people responsible for this, the greatest slaughter in history, are covering it up. It is not to be taught, anywhere.Small wonder that Paul Hollander had to spend almost a decade finding a publisher for this book. (!!)

Well, I surely missed this one in the theatres! This is probably one of Michael Caine's finest performances, and the screenplay by Andrew Klavan is superb as well. You could look on it as a modern riff on "Kind Hearts and Coronets." Black, black humor indeed! It's up there with "Gods & Monsters" as a film which deserves a wide viewing. And now DVDs and video downloads make it possible!!

While the very words "Horatio Alger" have passed into American English ("his success was a true Horatio Alger story"), Alger's books have gone terribly out of fashion. They are rarely read, which is one reason I decided to give "Ragged Dick" a try.Most literary types would find this book poorly written, but it is certainly well enough written to tell its tale, and it's very hard to get a few pages into the book without starting to cheer for Ragged Dick, the boot-black. In a lot of ways, the book is surprisingly realistic: robbery and fraud are constant companions on the streets of New York. But so are sudden acts of compassion and generosity.Readers will find that Alger ceaselessly preaches the gospel of hard work, thrift, self-reliance, education and good moral character. One of Dick's big steps upwards occurs when he decides to attend a Sunday school, which certainly would not meet with approval from our liberal elite, any more than prayer. Our elite would probably be amazed that Dick accomplishes all of his self-improvement without ever once thinking of government help...it simply never crosses his mind.The most surprising thing, for me, was that I came to like "Ragged Dick" quite a bit. He's got a wicked sense of humor, referring often to his "urgent luncheon date with the Mayor" or his "Erie Canal shares." I'm pretty sure that this explains why the book sold in the millions: Dick is simply a great character.The books may have gone out of fashion, but they are NOT out of date. :-)

I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The first chapter, on Chaucer, was brilliant and illuminating; the details of his life here were not mentioned when I was in college, and the analysis of his genius made me want to go back and look at "The Canterbury Tales" all over again. And this is where the "dangerous" part comes in: I wound up ordering the original Middle English for my Kindle, and a good translation in paperback.The next chapter, on Albrecht Durer, was equally fascinating, and I wound up ordering a couple books of Durer's drawings and woodcuts! More danger! :-)I survived the chapter on Shakespeare undamaged, since I already have everything Shakespeare wrote.But the fascination (and the "danger") go on and on. I have so far resisted the idea of ordering any more of Bach's music, but I do want to investigate the work of a man named Pugin, whom I had never heard of before. Jane Austen and George Eliot deserve a more thorough review, and so on.So I am reminded of a term I heard from the book-trade: "Mrs. X is one of the best hand-sellers in the business." What's a "hand-seller?" Well, this is basically a person who reads widely and loves books, and will engage customers in conversation, dropping in things like, "Oh, so you like Dickens, do you? Have you ever read anything by Trollope?" And she puts a copy of "The Warden" in your hand. "Oh, you follow the career of Freud, do you? Have you read this latest book?" -- and another book is plopped into your hand. When you finally reach the check-out counter, you may be holding four or five books you had not even contemplated buying, but are now eager to read.Paul Johnson's "Creators" is just such an experience, but I'm pretty sure that he gets no commission from his excellent work!! :-)

To begin with, I suspect that the real "author" of this book was Warren Johanssen, a very important figure -- perhaps the dominant figure -- in the world of New York gay academics. I say this because (a) Walter Breen was a coin expert and (b) the footnotes and bibliography belong to Warren.Much later, Warren Johannsen made extremely important contributions to "The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality," the most important reference work on this topic ever published.But Warren liked to remain in the background. He had no desire for publicity, but was fluent in some 14 languages.That said, Walter Breen managed to write a fairly stupid book on top of the scholarly background provided by Warren. His theme throughout the book is that the only purpose of a love between a man and a younger guy is to encourage the younger guy onto the path of True Heterosexuality, and this is a theme so foolish that I am embarrassed to repeat it. People are who they are!! Why should a gay man in love with a younger guy act like a parental surrogate, and continue insisting that Lovely Heterosexuality is the goal of life, when in fact his boyfriend might be utterly gay?Walter Breen was a brilliant numismatist, but a very stupid man, who did time in prison several times for extremely inappropriate sexual and social behavior. Towards the end of his life (I have heard) he began regarding the friends of his sons as legitimate targets (!). He wound up in prison and died there, as he so richly deserved.Sorry: not all gay men are good! Welcome to the real world!

...and with the fourth volume come the miracles. In the space of six years, Dostoevsky wrote "Crime and Punishment," "The Idiot," and "Demons" --- all of them masterpieces."Crime & Punishment" took Russia by storm; it was said that nobody read anything else in the year 1866. It was also said that reading it was so hypnotizing that it was actually dangerous. Myself, I haven't read this novel since I was in my 20's, but I'm quite sure that a re-reading is coming right up. I remember well that "The Idiot" was just as maddeningly hypnotic. But I haven't yet read "Demons" AKA "The Possessed."To think that one man wrote all of this in six years is simply mind-boggling, not to mention his novellas "The Gambler" and "The Constant Husband." Plagued by poverty and epileptic fits, the story of these six years is just fascinating, and once again shows that Joseph Frank was absolutely right when he cast everything else aside and decided to devote his life to understanding this man Dostoevsky, who may lay claim to the mantle of the greatest novelist of the 19th century.For lovers of literature, this is the prime stuff!

I was fascinated to see that Kinglake's enormous history of the Crimean War has been brought back into print. I am aware that some people doubt Kinglake's history, and don't like it. After all, it is hard to get people to agree about anything.But, for me, the real interest of Alexander Kinglake comes from a volume of memoirs. The author of these memoirs had the chance to meet Winston Churchill, and asked the great man what he could read to improve his style. Churchill growled back, "Kinglake." So the memoirist took himself off to a local bookstore, and discovered Kinglake's "Eothen," a masterpiece of travel-writing that has probably never been out of print.Some time later, the same memoirist had another chance to meet Churchill, and this time around he was able to say that he had really enjoyed reading Kinglake, and would appreciate another suggestion. In return, Churchill growled, "MORE Kinglake." So our memoirist took himself off to the bookshop again, and discovered the only other book ever written by Alexander Kinglake, his 8-volume "Invasion of the Crimea."Was Winston Churchill JOKING? Our memoirist thought not, bought the books, and was mightily improved by them.Open up the first volume, read the first page, and find yourself in the presence of a master of English prose.I'm extremely glad for the paperback edition of this book, because my other copies are so old that they are Valuable, and so they don't make good reading copies.Would you like to write superb English? Start with Gibbon and Kinglake!!------------------- UPDATED REVIEW -----------------Kinglake is not only a master of style, he is a master historian. Anyone interested in history will want to have this volume. His introductory description of the Crimea is excellent, his explanation of "The Usage" in the world of European diplomacy is found nowhere else (so far as I know), and his portraits of the Russian Czar Nicholas, with his adversary, Stratford Canning (later Lord Stratford) are fascinating.With all of that comes one of the greatest historical essays ever written -- Kinglake's brilliant analysis of Napoleon II, and how he managed to steal France from the French.This is a truly superb book in all respects.Highest possible recommendation!

When Flaubert published "Madame Bovary," it was a runawaysuccess -- the Parisian sophisticates enjoyed Flaubert'sdevastating portrait of French provincial life -- cramped,stupid, poor and miserable.But when Flaubert turned his satirical eye on Parisitself, in "Sentimental Education," the good timesabruptly stopped rolling. Nobody liked this book whenit first appeared; the few reviews it got weredeadly.Which may tell you something about human nature, alwaysenjoying the laugh when it's on someone else!It is said that Ford Madox Ford claimed that he hadto read "Sentimental Education" a dozen times before hefinally understood every detail of this marvellous workof art. Every detail is considered, every word is weighed.The plot is wonderful and extremely complex. There areabout seventeen major characters (!) brought successfullyto life.The young may misunderstand this book. I did. When I wasyounger, it seemed to be just a tale of two loyalfriends trying to make their way in the hostile world ofParis, and suffering a great number of misfortunes.Going back, and re-reading this great novel when I wasolder, I blushed again and again over the stupidity ofthe main character, Frederic Moreau. It is delineated ina brilliant miniature, right in Chapter One. Fredericis on a boat home to the provinces, and he meets andfalls in love with Madame Arnoux. A harpist appears toplay music, and Frederic enjoys the music hugelybecause he's in love. When the harpist passes the hat,Frederic drops in a gold louis because his mood is sohappy. A few moments later, he "realizes" that this wasall the money he had; he's hungry for lunch and doesn'thave a sou to his name.Now, while we may want to pardon the sentimentalexcesses of youth, it is also brilliantly clear thatFrederic had better outgrow this habit of givingaway his last franc for no reason at all, especiallywhen he needs it to eat!Well, he doesn't outgrow the habit, to put it briefly.There is an entire subplot involving Frederic'sidiotic mishandling of money. But that's not all:Frederic graduated at the head ofhis class in high school, and apparently has a brilliantlegal career ahead of him. So -- does he study hard?Does he persevere? A better question would be: why doesFrederic just stop going to his university law classes,and sink into idleness?But there is more -- much, much more -- in this wonderfulbook. I'll give you one small example which I finallynoticed myself. In Chapter One, Frederic meets MadameArnoux, and hears that her first name is "Marie." (Heshouts it out loud, later on, walking down a lonelycountry road.)Many chapters later, someone apparently insults thereputation of his "true love," saying that all Parisknows about "Sophie Arnoux." But that's not her rightname! Frederic could easily (and devastatingly reply),"You can't know much about that lady if you don't evenknow her name," but he misses this chance, goes on tobecome furious, and winds up forced to fight a duel!This may be the best book Flaubert ever wrote, and itis certainly one of the best novels ever written.Highest possible recommendation!!

This book is almost 700 pages long and goes into detail about every aspect of Thai cooking. I haven't finished reading it yet -- that may be a few years away! -- but I have read enough to see that it is solid and extremely well-informed. This is NOT an amateur effort.For example, one thing that may seem "backwards" to foreigners is the very idea that when you are eating, you are eating RICE. Those other dishes that go with the rice -- the curries, soups and salads that people rave about -- are generically known as "kab khaaw" -- "with rice." The author gets this point absolutely right.Another point of distinction: where other books may mention sticky rice and jasmine rice, this book has a CHAPTER devoted to the history and cultivation of rice.The only downside is that the recipes can be extraordinarily complex and time-consuming, not such a swell idea if you are cooking for one. On the other hand, if you're a member of the royal family, or simply very rich, you can have it all done for you. It's one of the reasons food is getting simpler these days: you have to do it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you. And is it worth working ten hours to enjoy ten minutes of wonderful food?Still, all this says nothing against this book, which is a flat-out masterpiece. And some of the recipes are so tempting that I'll probably give them a go, sooner or later. At the very least, the author has written down true Thai recipes for future generations, and deserves huge credit for that.The photographs are superb as well.For those who only occasionally aspire to the summit, I still recommendReal Thai: The Best of Thailand's Regional Cookingfor everyday use. This would be for people who actually buy their curry pastes ready-made at the market, rather then whomping them up at home. In any case, if you have these two books, it's very hard to go wrong.Highest possible recommendation!

Saul Alinsky never managed to achieve any real power in his own lifetime, or he might have added one all-important footnote to his sad little book: "Dump these rules if you ever do get into power."The primary example here is "Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it." This may (MAY!) be helpful at times during a campaign, but it is deadly when the campaigning is over.We have the example right before our eyes: the current administration can't seem to go a week without picking a target, freezing it, personalizing it, and then attacking it. So far we have doctors accused of performing unnecessary operations, legitimate holders of corporate bonds attacked as speculators, insurance companies, Wall Street companies, veterans, tea party activists, an individual white police officer, talk show hosts, an entire news organization, and now even the Chamber of Commerce --- all singled out for attack and demonization.This is not called "governing." It's called "making enemies as fast as you possibly can, at a time when you need all the popular support you can possibly get."P.S. Get your hands on David Horowitz's broadside, "Barack Obama's Rules for Revolution: The Alinsky Model." The whole story is there.

It surprises me that this book is more than ten years old. I guess I let my mind run on automatic pilot with regard to "Intelligent Design" --- and the autopilot tended to assume that ID was going to be completely uninteresting, like the "ideas" of a flat earth, or young-earth creationism.This book, along withSignature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, has convinced me that my autopilot was completely mistaken. Intelligent Design is NOT "creationism dressed up in a cheap tuxedo." As Stephen Meyer has pointed out, the creationist movement grew out of the Bible --- it was born in Holy Writ. Intelligent Design comes out of science, most particularly the stunning discoveries about the nanotechnology in the living cell.What we have found in the cell is an amazing, very large group of molecular machines, which could be called a nanotechnology factory. Probably the most amazing thing about this factory is that it can duplicate itself, and perhaps the most inexplicable thing is that it runs using computer technology. The genetic code found in DNA is something we might never have understood without discovering computers first, and it's also something we NEVER would have comprehended if we hadn't found the "decoder ring" right there in the cell with the genetic code. Who would have dreamed that three letters of genetic code specified an amino acid, and that a sequence of hundreds of letters would specify all the amino acids needed to make a specific protein?The question asks itself: how did this come about? The Darwinian fundamentalists naturally think that it happened by "evolution," their one-word answer for everything, but they have yet to come up with even one plausible explanation of how this stuff evolved. The problem is "irreducible complexity," which is found when a machine needs all of its parts in order to function, and the different parts by themselves do nothing. A simple example of evolution (in our hands) might be scissors: we can see pretty easily how a stone tool became a metal knife (useful all the way), and how two metal knives were lashed together to make the first clumsy pair of scissors. But that sort of step-by-step evolution does NOT explain a mousetrap, much less DNA, messenger RNA, and the rest of the amazing stuff going on in a human cell. Compared with a cell, the Jacquard loom is downright primitive --- and that loom is what led to the "IBM card" (the Hollerith punch card) of distant memory.I guess there are two main books which explain Intelligent Design, this one and Stephen Meyer's book. Meyer's book is slightly more difficult and technical, while this one is a bit easier to read and has more humor. The choice is up to you, but I would strongly recommend looking at one of them.This is NOT creationism redux, it's the beginning of a paradigm shift. Darwinian evolution can explain a lot of things, but it can't explain the origin of the universe or the origin of life.As a final note, if these books get you to thinking about who the Designer might be, it's well to remember that he is not necessarily the God of any particular religion. You may be persuaded that The Great Spirit or The Force is probably there, but he or it remains completely mysterious --- aside from being incomprehensibly intelligent.

This knife is amazingly sharp, and I am quite sure I will be eagerly looking for things to cut with it for a month or two. I haven't cut myself yet (hooray!). But the old folk wisdom says that a dull knife is a dangerous knife.(Peering into the future...) It seems completely inevitable to me that two things are coming down the pike. First, more and more people will discover the virtues of these ceramic knives, and so Kyocera will begin facing some serious competition in this arena (to date, there is none. But just you wait until 3M, or other companies, get into the game). As a result, these somewhat-pricey knives will become a lot cheaper.Second, we will all have to get used to having two sorts of knives in our kitchens: the steel knives and the ceramic knives. In a way, it will be just like the Teflon revolution, where years were spent explaining to people that Teflon cookware involved rules --- but then the teenage daughter or son would "forget" and scratch the holy bejesus out of a good piece of Teflon cookware.But did we stop buying Teflon because of accidents like this? Nooooooo.In the same way, people are going to have to learn the ways of the new ceramic knives, which seem to be quite brittle. Don't use them to cut cheese --- why? Well, I think: cheese is typically a rubbery substance, which might encourage the blade to bend, and then -- SNAP! -- no more ceramic knife.But the sharpness and the ease of use are a real treat! Even more, no steeling is wanted or possible. No sharpening in the home is wanted or possible. Here in Thailand, I got a free pass for two sharpenings in the next six years. I suspect I won't need them.WHAT A KNIFE!!!!---- Update, December 2010 ------I took my knife in for a free sharpening, after over a year of use (it was still pretty sharp) and it came back sharper than new!

This book amounts to a survey of Western literature since Dante and Shakespeare, and is a typical Bloom-book in being very thought-provoking. His central message is a very important one -- Western civilization is apparently at some risk of abandoning its literature.However improbable this may sound, I hasten to assure you that our radicalized universities have done everything in their power to neglect and abandon our literary masterpieces. At a large state university in California, the standard reading list for the "Great Books" course (formerly several dozen books) has been reduced to:1. Plato's "Symposium"2. Thoreau's "Walden"3. Gandhi's "Hind Swaraj"4. Alice Walker's "The Color Purple"Even more melancholy is the fact that this list evidently includes one "gay" book, one "environmentalist" book, one "pacifist" book, and one "feminist" book. That three of them are bilge seems not to have occurred to the nominating committee. (Many would deny Thoreau that palm -- I urge them to re-read this idiotic pretentious crack-pate in the company of "Saint Gandhi" and his lunatic prescriptions for India: "Get rid of all the trains and all the doctors," indeed!)So, the current situation in American universities is chilling, reminiscent of the Chinese purges during the "Cultural Revolution" (which was actually neither cultural nor a revolution, come to think of it, since it was a counter-revolution instigated by Mao against his enemies, and was explicitly anti-intellectual and anti-cultural. A mob attacked and destroyed the birthplace of Confucious during those palmy days.)Nevertheless, although Bloom is fighting the good fight, and is extremely erudite and thought-provoking, I must note two very serious objections to this present work.First, the Greeks and the Romans are mostly absent. I really don't see how you can even pretend to discuss "The Western Canon" and leave out Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles and the rest of the Greeks and the Romans. Especially since Bloom is extremely fond of the Old Testament ("the Yahwist"), this omission is startling.Second, I strongly object to the presence of Freud in this book. This mountebank first demanded our attention as a scientist -- as a man of medicine. To find him transmogrified into a Literary Artist -- at Bloom's whim -- simply boggles the imagination.If you put these two faults together, and conclude that Freud has been included at the expense of the Greeks, then the result is a tremendously flawed book. It becomes a presentation of the "Western Canon" which is almost whimsical.Not highly recommended!

Like many other people, I was outraged when this docu-drama was consigned to the ash-heaps of history, in flagrant violation of the First Amendment.Yes, I've had chats with "liberal" friends who say, "It wasn't just the Clintons, a lot of people were very upset by this." Well, an awful lot of people don't like the Marquis de Sade, either, but he's in print and for sale. Somehow, "The Path to 9/11" just got flushed.However, 5-6 years later, it has "escaped" to DVD. I managed to get a copy from Canada, and watching it only increased my outrage. It's an excellent film! I even learned something from it: Khalid Sheikh Mohamad (KSM) was Ramzi Yousef's uncle. What a wonderful family they were: Ramzi was the one who planted the truck-bomb under the World Trade Center, and whose fiendish heart was broken when the bombed tower failed to collapse into the other tower. KSM was of course the mastermind behind 9/11.This film should be freely available in the US, if only to shut up the Truthers with the actual truth. But who has the backbone to do it??That's a sad question, isn't it?If you want to understand how American censorship works, I suggestBlocking The Path To 9/11.

This book is the first volume in a five-volume, semi-biographical study of Dostoevsky.The five volumes, put together, amount to some 3,000 pages!!Who in their right mind would want to read these five volumes about a Russian novelist...much less (ahem) write them?I'm not quite sure, but, as Joseph Frank admits, he just got sucked in. He couldn't deal with Dostoevsky on a superficial level, BUT as he probed deeper and deeper into this author and his cultural milieu, he simply got hooked. The result, for Joseph Frank, was a masterpiece of literary and cultural analysis.The result, for us common readers, is a study that does an awful lot to explain where Dostoevsky was coming from. And he was born and raised in an extremely complex environment, where his father was trying constantly to "rise" socially --- and to instill Russian Orthodoxy into his children. From an early age, Dostoevsky was an addict of literature who inhaled other writers in a matter of months --- writers from Pushkin to Balzac. And, in his early years, he was horrified by the social conditions in Russia, where there seem to have been just three classes of people (the monarch and the aristocrats, the landed gentry, and the serf peasants --- who were actually slaves, although nobody seems to call them that.) Tolstoy, for example, was an aristocrat, who insisted on a strict distinction between his own family and their slaves, forbidding any contact between them.What made the whole system much worse was the Russian habit of "social superiors" beating and whipping their "social inferiors," sometimes without any reason. The late adolescent Dostoevsky witnessed this for the first time, while travelling from Moscow to St. Petersburg, and the horror stuck with him for the rest of his life.I have to echo one of the critics, who claimed that Joseph Frank has written a literary life that is as compelling and fascinating as a novel. Like Frank, I find myself getting increasingly absorbed by the tale he has to tell, and the protagonist of that tale.Joseph Frank deserves extra-special recommendation for ignoring ALL of the degenerate literary fashions of his time: Foucault, Derrida, and "deconstruction" never even get a dishonorable mention. Instead, he devoted his life to the thing a literary critic SHOULD do: understand the cultural environment of the author, understand what the author was trying to do, and then attempt to assess his success or failure. No "theories" of literary criticism are needed, thank you very much.In any case, I'm now into volume II of this absorbing study.Dostoevsky, at his best, wrote masterpieces describing this socially tortured country. And he was also, from time to time, amazingly prophetic: he seems to have been about the only person who foresaw the catastrophe coming for his beloved Russia. The story of how he became a literary giant really needed to be told.

St. Thomas Aquinas was nicknamed "The Dumb Ox" not because he was stupid, but because he didn't talk very much. According to many, he was the greatest philosopher between Aristotle and Descartes.An example of his silence was the night he was more or less forced to dine with the French King, the universally-beloved St. Louis. Royal dinners were not his style, and he sat silently while the French nobility did their "witty conversation" thing. There was a pause in the "witty conversation," and St. Thomas suddenly smashed his fist down on the table, exclaiming, "THAT should settle the Manichees!!"The other guests stared dumbfounded at this horrible breach of etiquette, but the King was smart enough to send two secretaries around to St. Thomas, to make sure he didn't lose that thought.This volume also contains another Chesterton masterpiece, his life of St. Francis.I am not a Catholic, not even a Christian, but I found a lot of stuff in these biographies which makes a LOT more sense than what Atheists Inc. have brought to America and Europe. I'd much rather listen to a Te Deum than watch "reality TV," for example. And these two short biographies are worth your time because they are an excellent visit with Dr. Sanity.

I had to abandon this book after dipping into a few chapters and finding the same dreary "professional philosopher" logic-chopping on every page. Believe it or not, Swinburne finds it necessary to BEGIN his book with a discussion of the various types of logical proofs, inductive or deductive, and winds up using MATH in his chapter on the problem of evil, which strikes me as completely absurd. ("If the coefficient of evil in this world amount to less than .15 of the coefficient of rationality minus .90 of the coefficient of good" --- well, that's not what Swinburne wrote, it's a parody from memory.) I strongly feel that, if you want to discuss the problem of evil (theodicy) you need to begin with "The Brothers Karamazov," where the problem is raised in truly horrifying terms, NOT in the terms of "stubbing your toe may be useful in the long run."I don't think this book is going to convince ANYONE, and the maximum impact it will have will be on a few professional theologians and other harmless drudges. If you want to see a real argument in favor of a divine intelligence which created and sustains the universe, read Varghese'sThe Wonder of the World: A Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God. For me, it's the difference between a Maserati and a 1960's VW.

If I remember aright, this film was savaged on its initial release, with the reaction running all the way from "A film for hate-filled morons" to "A film for hate-filled morons."Well, that was then, and this is now. This film has not done a disappearing act, and is in fact a very valuable documentary, which covers the very curious "reverse-Galileo" process currently taking place. By this I mean, we have listened to countless inaccurate accounts of how the hate-filled moronic Popes persecuted the poor innocent Galileo. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, and Atheist Scientists Inc. are persecuting anyone who thinks that science and religion may have something valuable to say to each other -- including firing them on the spot --- the atheist scientists seem curiously unable to see that they are "The New Popes."Conformism is interesting. When I grew up in the 1950's, the curse word was "atheist" and a divorced man had no hope of winning the Presidency. Nowadays, "religious" has become the new curse word, and atheism is a badge of honor. The thing that did not change was the conformity, the group-think, and the dismissive hate of non-conformists.This film is very valuable and worth owning for a number of reasons. The first would be the amazing computer simulation of the animal cell, which is what caused all the uproar in the first place. The second would be Richard Dawkins gladly confessing that he had no problem with the concept of intelligent design!! However, he insisted that the designers would have to be space aliens from another planet --- something which struck him as possible and likely, while the idea of a God involved in creation was absolutely ridiculous.This struck me as passing strange, that ANYONE would put more faith in unknown, hypothetical space aliens from the planet Xoto (OK, I made that up) than in one of mankind's oldest hypotheses, which is simply that God created the heavens and the earth. This indicated to me just how far someone as bloody-minded as Dawkins would go to exclude God. "Space aliens are much more likely!"The third thing I really liked about this documentary was the fact that it interviewed a lot of the major players on both sides of the debate, and clearly established the fact that one side ruled the roost, and had no qualms about persecuting its intellectual enemies.For honesty-in-reviewing, I am a lifelong atheist who recently dropped the "a" and am now a theist. I have no stake in any organized religion, but I do have a huge stake in the concept and practice of freedom, most definitely including intellectual freedom in our universities.Watch this movie and make up your own mind. My firm opinion (as of today) is that a huge paradigm shift is underway, and the Old Guard is panicking."The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvellous structure of reality."It is enough if one tries to comprehend only a little of this mystery every day."---Albert Einstein

This is a really great edition of the Bible: a classic religious text in a classic translation. As noted by others, it works for all sorts and varieties of Christians.The only drawbacks are obvious: it is not bound in leather or leatherette, and there is no little ribbon to hold your place. If you can live without those features, place this edition high on your list!

Just as one point: our "environmentalist" thinkers have decided that all human evil originates from the OUTSIDE. We are all born lovely and natural, but society corrupts us.How then to explain envy, the cancer which grows from within -- and only grows in SOME people?I strongly suggest you read this book; it is an important part of anyone's education. And the insights will suddenly start coming: Lee Harvey Oswald shooting John F. Kennedy -- could there be a clearer case of ENVY in the universe? Oswald, a lonely, failed drifter, prey to any radicals who wanted to use him -- versus Kennedy: rich, handsome, famous, brilliant, President of the U.S. and married to Jackie.Oh, envy pulled that trigger.What about Al-Qaeda and the Islamofascists? Does anyone doubt that, beneath all their hand-waving, their entire movement is based on ENVY?Domestically, in the U.S., we have huge cohorts of "political activists" driven by envy. As Schoeck points out, virtually nobody believes that establishing the grand egalitarian socialist state will eliminate envy: on the contrary, such a state will only exacerbate an evil which is detested by all societies on the face of the earth.On a smaller level, but still very important, this book does an excellent job of explaining that short masterpiece by Herman Melville, "Billy Budd." What was wrong with Claggart? Nothing other than envy. He envied everything good about Billy Budd: his beauty, his charm, his ease of making friends, his lack of envy, and his overall grace. Now there is something to think about when you go to bed at night: malignant people who hate and fear ALL the good qualities of their fellow human beings. (This actually makes me fear for some of my good friends, who are the kind we call "a prince among guys:" -- that snake envy may be waiting to take them down!)An extremely high recommendation, indeed!

When David Horowitz calls this "the most powerful film ever made about the true nature of the American left," I sit up and pay attention, because no conservative knows more about the American left than Horowitz.This documentary is a brilliant collaboration between Stephen K. Bannon, David N. Bossie, Horowitz, the late lamented (!) Andrew Breitbart, and a host of others.Be prepared to be shocked. You have never really SEEN the true Occupy movement, and the MSM have certainly given you no clue about who organized it and why. After you see all the violence, arson -- after you hear about the huge rape problem -- after you see their rat-infested camping grounds -- you will be shocked again to know that bigwigs in the Democratic Party (Pelosi, Reid, and Obama) were cheering these rioters on, apparently careless of the damage to civil society that was being done.Make no mistake: these people hate America, hate capitalism, and want a violent revolution. They have no idea what they're going to replace America with; they are nihilists.Highest possible recommendation!

Ali Dashti was a gentleman and a scholar. Born in a Shi'ite area of Iraq, he returned to his native Persia after completing a traditional religious education. He had an active political career (serving in the Mossadeq cabinet, for example) and also published many scholarly works on Persian poetry.This book is his attempt to deal with the phenomenon of Muhammad, and the Islamic religion he created. Most Westerners are not really aware that Persians are NOT Arabs. Persians speak an Indo-European language (Farsi) while Arabs speak a Semitic language (closely related to Hebrew). As a result, many educated Persians/Iranians view the Arabs as barbarian invaders, comparable perhaps to the Mongols, while it is widely known that Persia is one of the most ancient civilizations on the planet.On the whole, I think Dashti deals with Muhammad fairly. Of course, this was an extremely dangerous book to write, and he didn't really get away with it, in the end. The 83-year-old Ali Dashti was dragged to Khomeini's dungeons and beaten or tortured, giving up the ghost two years later. It is a remarkable thing: beating an 83-year-old man because you disagree with his thinking.My own historical researches make me ask: is there any more reason to believe in Muhammad than in Joseph Smith? (Joseph Smith is the "prophet" who founded the Mormon religion.) Or were these two men basically living the same old story, separated by 1300 years of history?Highest recommendation!!

This is definitely one of the most refreshing and surprising books I have ever read. It makes me realize (among other things) how much anti-Christian, "Dark Ages" propaganda I have been indoctrinated with. This is a book which is badly needed, and needed NOW, with so many born-again anti-Christians running around. I suppose the finger of blame needs to be pointed at Gibbon's "Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire." Rodney Stark's first main argument is that Gibbon had hold of the wrong end of the stick: the Roman Empire was a slave-driving tyranny that badly deserved to crumble and fall. Crumble and fall it did, because of its own internal logic: tyrannies never produce good economies or good citizens.Well, the Western Empire did fall, so we were off into the Dark Ages, right? So we have been told, a thousand times. The facts are quite different, since what actually happened was an explosion of European creativity and progress, freed from the Roman tyranny and guided by the precepts of Christian theology. Christian theology expected progress, because it was future-oriented, and because it believed that the natural world followed natural laws. In quick order, the "ignorant peasants" of the "Dark Ages" discovered the metal plow, the three-field system of cultivation, the water wheel, the windmill, the stirrup, chain-mail armor, and other items too numerous to mention in a brief (!) review. Christianity and science were not opposed; they worked together, hand in hand, as is obvious from the history of the great monastic estates and the discoveries made there. Again, there are too many items to discuss, but one sticks in my memory: nobody had discovered how to transport heavy loads over long distances, before the "ignorant peasants" of the "Dark Ages" figured out the correct way to harness draft animals, and also began breeding much larger horses. (Oh, and they invented the horse-shoe as well). Eyeglasses and watches --- no one else had them! And nobody else had the system of private property, free trade, and capitalism which were developed during the "Dark Ages." In fact, the whole capitalist system originated in Christian monasteries.Higher culture was not in disarray: writers from Dante to Chaucer helped to create the vernacular languages of Europe. Universities were created by the Church. Polyphonic music was discovered (or invented), and so were the instruments to play it.I hope this gives you a taste of the book's contents. In case you are wondering about reviewer bias, I am not a Christian. But I am a member of (what used to be) Western Civilization, and I am convinced that we must understand where it came from if we want to prevent it perishing. It may be the case that "all of mankind's great religions are false," as Santayana claimed, but, strangely enough, it does not follow that they are all equally effective or equally good. After all, we lived with the Ptolemaic system for centuries, and made great progress in astronomy -- even though the Ptolemaic system was upside-down. If Christianity tells a culture that it can move towards the future --- that it can understand the natural world --- these may be critically important theological points.Highest possible recommendation!

Bill Whittle is a man I'm keeping my eye on. As far as I know, he was virtually unknown 3-4 years ago, and then he was a leading light on Pajamas TV (PJTV), an Internet "TV station" worth looking into. He had his own series called "Afterburner," and also took part in "Trifecta." He now works independently, and his his own YouTube channel, "Firewall," where he continues his unusually clear and compelling discussions about what this country is all about.What is surprising about this "man who came from nowhere" is his gift with words and ideas. The current book, "Silent America," might be regarded as Bill Whittle "warming up," as he was with his excellent blog, "Eject! Eject! Eject!"Although he seems to be at his peak while speaking (rather than writing), the man is extremely talented, and this book may be compared with Lee Harris'sThe Next American Civil War: The Populist Revolt against the Liberal Elite. Unless I miss my guess badly, Bill Whittle is on the other side of the question Harris brings up: Bill speaks at Tea Party events and is a staunch advocate of limited government and entrepreneurial freedom. Another thing that is extremely obvious (it drips from the pages of "Silent America") is his deep love of his country and his countrymen, as well as his fierce gratitude to the American soldiers who have saved our country so many times, at incredible cost. (I don't notice this so much with Lee Harris and his devotion to his "meritocracy;" frankly, I didn't notice it at all.)So, if you're wondering what this "Tea Party" thing is all about, and you suspect that the mainstream news media are not exactly giving us an unbiased account of it (they spent months pretending it didn't exist, and then they tried to brand the "Teabaggers" as racist), here are the facts, from the horse's mouth. Bill Whittle loves his country, he wants to make sure that we are going after Islamic jihadis with everything it takes, he is a totally unapologetic defender of our removal of Saddam Hussein. If you read this book, and watch some of the programs on PJTV, you'll get all the information you need --- direct.I would note that Bill's rhetorical gifts are sometimes amazing. He even says that the things that he writes do not come "from him" but "through him." He notes Shelby Foote's remark about Lincoln during the Civil War, when Lincoln began finding his true voice: "And that Lincoln music began to sound." He compares that "Lincoln music" with some of Ronald Reagan's finer moments. (Amusingly enough, Whittle began with a strong dislike of Reagan, just as I did, and we've both been kicking ourselves ever since! :-) ) Another name that leaps to the mind is of course, Winston Churchill. That "Churchill music" played a huge part in the final Allied victory in World War II.And now we have "Whittle music." At least he speaks more directly and movingly to me (and many others) than any politician currently in sight.This book is well worth your time and money.

I have only finished the first few chapters of this book, but those were enough to make me recommend this book without hesitation. Perhaps the most gloomy thought arising from the reading was: "Oh no, the Europeans are doing it again." And when I say "doing it again," I mean starting a World War. After all, ever since 9/11 we have known that the majority of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. A much more disturbing question is how many of them came via EUROPE. Muhammad Atta, the ringleader, for sure. In this century, more than 350,000 Americans have laid down their lives in EUROPE, trying to keep Europe alive and free. How then can it possibly be true that EUROPE is alive with anti-Americanism, and tolerating large communities of Islamic radicals who have sworn, over and over again, to destroy America?I will single out two items which absolutely defy belief.First, after the murder of Theo Van Gogh, someone painted a large mural in Holland proclaiming "Thou shalt not kill." A local Muslim, incredibly, objected to the mural on the grounds that it was "racist." Even more incredibly, the Dutch authorities capitulated to him and ordered the mural painted over. Even MORE incredibly, someone filming the destruction of the mural had his videotape confiscated and destroyed.Are we in full surrender mode yet, or not??Second: a top Dutch politician now spends every night in a high-security prison because his security guards cannot vouch for his safety otherwise! He is "allowed" weekly visits with his wife! On the other hand, a man who murdered a top Dutch politician was fined 34,000 Euros and will be out of prison within a few years -- he did not get life imprisonment!So Dutch politicians are forced to spend their lives in prison, while their murderers are fined and released!!Are we in full surrender mode yet, or not?!Buy this book and read it.

Until I got to retirement age, I had been a big fan of classical music without really knowing much about it. I finally ordered this book to get myself some education.The author has his strong opinions, but what the heck, so do I. I am never going to become a fan of atonal music -- in my opinion, the quickest & surest way of emptying a concert hall. But it was a bit disturbing to learn that Richard Strauss was "a pig" and that Bruckner was a "nincompoop" -- not that these facts affect their music in the slightest.Two coincidences strengthened my opinion of this book. I had recently discovered Beethoven's Piano Concerto #4 on YouTube (Bernstein / Zimerman) and it blew me away. Swafford agrees that the Fourth is Beethoven's best piano concerto.The second coincidence was Theodore Dalrymple's very enthusiastic mention of the Haydn String Quartets. I began listening to some of them on YouTube and realized that there was a complete universe of beautiful music I had never noticed before. Swafford has basically the same opinion, that classical music has nothing to compare with the Haydn Quartets.There is a world of excellent information in this book, & I recommend it highly.

First of all, I have to congratulate Illustra Media on the beauty and professionalism of these DVDs --- ALL of them.The first one, "Darwin's Dilemma," deals with the Cambrian Explosion and Darwin's inability to explain it. This is not something put in Darwin's mouth. It is taken from his own writings. The fossil record looks nothing like Darwin's "Tree of Life." Frankly, I have no idea why people get upset when difficulties are pointed out with Darwin's theory. It's old, musty, Victorian stuff. Just last week, some scientists observed neutrinos going faster than light. If that is true, Einstein is due for some serious updating. But nobody got all hot under the collar and screamed, "You can't attack Einstein!"The second DVD, "Unlocking the Mystery of Life," deals with the incredible nanotechnology inside bacteria and human cells. The computer animation alone is worth the price of admission.The third DVD, "The Privileged Planet," explores the tantalizing, uncanny relationship between Earth as a home of intelligent life, and Earth as an ideal platform for studying the universe. As Einstein pointed out, "The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible."The DVDs are loaded with interesting information.I don't think I'll surprise anyone by noting that this set comes from the Discovery Institute, and that the DVDs would like to provoke thought about the question of all this happening by chance, rather than design. I assume that if you are an adult, you can make up your own mind about this.I am recommending these DVDs because of their extraordinary quality and beauty, the extensive scientific facts presented in them, and a little bit because they ARE thought-provoking. I think that people should expose themselves to several points of view while making a decision (or withholding judgment).Now I'm going to watch their DVD about butterflies! :-)

Mircea Eliade was a genius, a polymath, and his three-volume history of religious ideas deserves to go on your bookshelf right next to Copleston's history of philosophy.I want this review to be brief, so I'll just point out that Page One is really worth the price of the entire book. On that page, Eliade simply reprints his earlier thoughts on religion in general, which strike me as absolutely true: around the world and throughout recorded time, we human beings have been religious.And this is something which really deserves serious thought and examination. I myself am about as religious as a pea, but I cannot help noticing that I am in a distinct minority. Then I look at Page One again, and think again about Eliade's statement that religion is a constant of human consciousness, NOT an historical stage which we have passed through.Well, the man who most fervently believed that religion was "only a phase" was Mr. Karl Marx, who nowadays looks to have been proven wrong about almost everything.As Eliade says, "it is difficult to imagine how the human mind could function without the conviction that there is something irreducibly *real* in the world; and it is impossible to imagine how consciousness could appear without conferring a *meaning* on man's impulses and experiences. Consciousness of a real and meaningful world is intimately connected with the discovery of the sacred.....Living, considered as being human, is in itself a *religious act*, for food-getting, sexual life, and work have a sacramental value. In other words, to be --- or, rather, to become --- *a man* signifies being 'religious.' "This might well be compared with Larkin's poem, "Church Going."Perhaps the question for us non-believers is not so much to "convert" others, as to try to define a religion that works for everyone. Just as an example, I cannot see any reason why a religious life should involve a conflict with science, or an easily-falsifiable belief that the Earth was created in 4,000 BC.In any case, Volume I begins with the Paleolithic -- the earliest hunter-gatherers. It continues through "the longest revolution" --- agriculture -- the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. The next stop is Mesopotamia and Sumer / Babylon, followed by the religious ideas of the Pharoahs. There is a "detour" into the mystery of the megaliths (Stonehenge etc.). There follows a discussion of the Hittites and the Canaanites, early Israel, and then a sudden shift to the Europeans and the Indian Vedic gods. The rest of the volume deals with the phases of Greek religion, Indian religion before Buddha, and Zarathustra.That's just Volume I of an extremely detailed and thorough history of our religious ideas.

As admirable as this three-volume set may be, it was published in 1985...25 years ago.As the years have gone by, Eliade's speculations about the possible religions of prehistoric man have only become more boring, while it is now becoming clear that he missed one of the most gigantic chapters in the history of religion, brilliantly described (in massive detail) in Jenkins'The Lost History of Christianity: The Thousand-Year Golden Age of the Church in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia--and How It Died.It's hard to blame Eliade for missing this huge, thousand-year history, because everyone else did.Why?Don't ask me!

I am just about to begin a re-reading of this enormously interesting novel. I've read it before, but memory fades. And, this time, I want to try reading it in French (with a crib by my side!)Lots of people have complimented Proust on his style, or his narrative technique, or whatever.The answer to those critics stands in the novel itself. It is incredibly obvious --- it's right there in plain language. Proust is discussing the familiar topic of a famous author and his imitators. What he says is truly, truly memorable: all the imitators had grasped his style, and imitated it, but what none of them had noticed was that the author they were trying to imitate had a singular capacity to tell the truth. That was something they could not imitate.Whether you want to call it "Remembrance of Things Past" -- or "In Search of Lost Time" -- whatever. The point for me is simple. In spite of Proust's crazy jealousy-complex, this magnificent work simply contains more TRUE SENTENCES than anything else I have ever read.Yes, you read me correctly, more TRUE SENTENCES. Many more than can be found in Plato or Aristotle or Freud or the Catholic Church.People may start catching on to this!

It seems to me that Philip Larkin actually became a dyspeptic old grouch around the age of twelve. This is not to fault his poetry -- he wrote very well. But don't come here expecting Pollyanna or Byron or Shakespeare. Larkin was pissed off by life, and expects to tell you about it. If you're in a grouchy mood, this will suit you just fine. :-)

What a wonderful book this is! Funny and heart-warming, indeed. On page one a 13-year-old boy falls in love with the beautiful black eyes of his cousin, and he tells the rest of the story.The characters are not "realistic." Heaven forfend! They are loving and comic exaggerations of real Persians, who could never be mistaken for (say) Japanese or Americans. For one obvious thing, there is the huge importance of the Very Extended Family, a simple fact of Persian life. In fact, some thinker once commented that Persians are still living a "tribal" life behind the walls of their homes. Is that true? Well, when I was in Iran, I had a best friend who, over a period of two years, introduced me to about 200 members of his family, and to precisely one unrelated friend! If I had to try to reciprocate as an American, I'd be stuck after the first four or five members of my immediate family...The stuff about "England being responsible for everything" really hits home, and is probably the reason the book became a runaway hit in Persia itself. I hope everyone noticed that during the recent anti-government riots in Persia, the crazed mullahs immediately arrested eight staff at the British Embassy! The loony but lovable old character, "Uncle Napoleon" goes so far as to believe that all of his failures in life happened because of a British Plot. And one reason he is the universe's biggest fan of Napoleon Bonaparte is (guess why!)....because Napoleon was a great enemy of England!England! Perfidious Albion! That sceptred isle of mad plotters, that counterfeit jewel set in a sea of treachery.... Well, you get the idea.For me, the most important extra-literary point of this book is that it shows us The Real Iran, a very human place where people fall in love, get married, write poems, and fall into insane rivalries. Neither the Iran of the Shah, nor the Iran of Khomeini: it has existed for thousands of years, and right now (perhaps) waits to be reborn.By the way, the title for this review, "But what if the murder victim refuses to come along?" points out the Monty Python in this book. A man runs away --- vanishes --- and some family member decides to accuse another family member of killing him. The police are called, and the numskull detective (following his "international method of surprise attack") immediately refers to the missing man as "the murder victim." He does it so insistently that others pick up his habit --- and then the missing man turns up alive. They call the detective, who instructs them to show up the next morning with "the murder victim." They answer, "But what if the murder victim refuses to come along?" Said totally dead-pan, of course! :-) :-)I would read this book along with Taheri's "The Persian Night" to try to get a grasp on the immensity of the tragedy. That is, try to imagine ANY of the characters in "My Uncle Napoleon" falling for the crazy party line of the mullahs in any real way. You can imagine them PRETENDING to do so, if it will help them steal a march on a family rival, but REALLY?As they used to sing on the mountain, "Man zan-e mullah ne misham! Chera ne mishid?" ("I will never consent to be the wife of a mullah," sings the soloist. "Why not?" sings the raucous chorus. The rest can be supplied for you by a Persian friend.... :-) )By the way, I believe the complete Persian TV series has shown up on YouTube. No subtitles that I've seen yet, alas. Search for "Daie Jan Napelon."

The poems in this book are ALL originals by Daniel Ladinsky. They have no connection at all with any poems ever written by Hafez.This fact is, by now, admitted. The crucial item is that Daniel Ladinsky cannot read Persian (Farsi) -- that is, he cannot read the poems which he claims to have "translated."So, the fans of "The Gift" will have to give up bragging at cocktail parties that they JUST LOVE THE POETRY OF HAFEZ.Well, they don't know the poetry of Hafez. The poetry of Hafez looks like this:---------------------------------------Hafez: Ghazel # 1O Boy! Pour the wine! Then pour it again:At first love seemed easy, but then came the pain.The scent of his locks, lovely musk in the dawn,Arouses your longing -- and then your heart's gone.The Master saith: "Stain your prayer-mat with wine!"His knowledge is deep, and his guidance divine.Pitch camp in his heart?! What rest will you know?When dawn splits the sky, away you must go!Dark night, crashing seas, the dread whirlpool's roar:How can they know this, at ease on the shore?I followed my will; it brought me disgrace:No secret that, for it's thrown in my face.Are you longing, Hafez, for his presence?Don't wander away, but stay in attendance.And when you behold his beloved face,You can leave this world of time and space.(Note for Amazon: translation done by me, and not copyright.)------------------Have fun looking for this in the works of Daniel Ladinski.

I must admit that my antennae are up recently, especially for mental midgets who want to praise Islam at the expense of Christendom, and this book fills the bill admirably.When it comes time to discuss the incredible burst of invention which was characteristic of the so-called "Dark Ages," the authors are sure to write Europe off as an inventive, but "aggressive" culture. This should raise more than a few eyebrows, because at the time under discussion, the peaceable farmers and monks of Europe were under almost non-stop attack from the growing Islamic empire. The Chanson de Roland (The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)) is surely not accurate history, but it REFLECTS accurate history.If you then look up "Islam," you will discover that Muslims "established" a world-wide empire in a century or two, but somehow, mysteriously, they don't get described as "aggressive." In fact, they are FAVORABLY compared as a people of high culture who simply established "empires of conquest," and let their subjects get on with their business with no problem, especially if they were "People Of The Book" (Jews & Christians). You will not find the word "jizya" in this book, and you will find no mention of the fact that the Muslims utterly destroyed Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity in Persia (Iran), or of their 700-year rampage in India, where Buddhism was destroyed, Buddhist and Hindu temples were razed, and Hindus were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands. No, the blame is cast on the "barbarian farmers" of Europe, who suddenly decided (for no reason) to set off on crusades to the Holy Land. This last statement is utterly false, and anyone can see for himself inGod's Battalions: The Case for the Crusades.In sum, this book is the usual multicultural mess, where all cultures are treated as noble and worthy things, EXCEPT OUR OWN. The authors barely mention European architecture of the period (which includes many amazing cathedral masterpieces), and they do not mention the invention of the pipe organ, the discovery of polyphonic music, and the invention of a system for writing music down. They seem almost embarrassed by the richness of European invention, and seem to be in a hurry to rush off and lecture us about the brilliance of the Mayans and the Aztecs.This puts me in mind of all those people waving "The Rainbow Flag," the symbol of diversity. But if you look closely, you will find no banner for whites, much less white heterosexual men.It is interesting to observe Democrats campaigning on a platform of "diversity" while excluding white males. Interesting in a tragic way.

This is a delightful and interesting little cookbook, which may fill your mind with interesting ideas.My favorite so far is "English Noodles." Boil the noodles and drain them, then put them back in the pot with a dollop of butter. Stir the butter into the noodles.You could hardly imagine anything simpler, but add salt and pepper and it's GOOD! More than that, this makes an excellent side dish to e.g. grilled pork steaks.Still, I really would like to know what Dr Pomiane would have done if his kitchen had been equipped with a slow-cooker and a microwave! I suspect he would have been most attracted to the slow-cooker, since that would have produced dinner in zero minutes.

What a nice thing it is, to slip a DVD or two into the player, and be entertained.There is no angst here. There is no cinema noir here. There is just a very fun movie, with lots of fun things about it. David Niven is superb, as always, and so is Cantinflas. By the way, when Mike Todd persuaded Cantinflas to do his first (and only?) English movie, Cantinflas was the richest actor in the world. So he did this role of Passepartout just for the fun of it, or just for the love of it.Mike Todd (TODD-AO !) is also a unique Hollywood character. He produced one movie in his life, and it won the Oscar for best movie. Evidently, he was a very persuasive talker.The TODD-AO makes for a great widescreen movie. The acting is fun, the movie is fun.Highest recommendation!

I watched this movie on DVD, so I came with some preconceptions: I more or less assumed that the Rand Fans came to watch in droves during the first week, and after that the movie flopped. I also read a piece where Hollywood veteran Roger L. Simon basically tore the movie to pieces.Well, I enjoyed it. Then again, I don't enjoy the vast majority of Hollywood movies, which strike me as cheap stuff designed to impress very young people for 90 minutes. Explosions, sex, drugs --- these are things which drive me away. Ideas attract me, but I suspect they drive most movie-goers away. Ideas!? How outrageous!! Even when these ideas are exactly the focus of the political debate currently going on in the US.Of course, a lot of movie-goers may have realized this, and rejected the movie because they reject the ideas of freedom, private property, hard work, and self-reliance.In any case, I found the movie refreshing, if only because it's the first movie concerned with ideas I've seen in fifty years or so, and also because I sympathize with the main characters and despise the villains (such as the happily-named Wesley Mouch).It seems like we're still trying to deal with JFK's idea: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."A good movie. I recommend it.

"....a certain reluctance to admit that Communism was not only physically lethal and mentally repressive but also a total failure."And can't we see that "reluctance" all around us today? What are Code Pink and International ANSWER saying, whenever they are questioned about the Communism they support?Beyond that, we can notice that the book is supremely well-written. (Another reviewer whines that it should have been dumbed down to his own subliterate level.) Who else could pin down the odious record of Communism in ten totally accurate and measured words?Conquest will make all of his readers THINK AGAIN about such fifty-dollar words as "democracy" and "fascism." But he's not belligerent about it, and in fact believes that a nation will NOT want to be ruled by people who are nuts about politics.There is much wisdom here, and much food for thought. After all, America didn't have to do an awful lot of radical changing during the 20th century. What it really had to do was STAY THE COURSE, against the Nazis and the Communists. Sadly enough, there was no real vacation once those tasks had been accomplished: maniac anti-Semitic Islamic fascists popped up and began a whole new round of terror and violence.Perhaps, once again, we just need to stay the course -- which means, once again, defeating the enemies of civilization.I now return to listening to Mozart, and wish you well.

"Ragazzi" begins as a series of comparison-photos: one photo will be a classical statue of a male nude, and the other will be a real, live breathing human being -- who looks quite a bit like the statue!It's an interesting technique which makes an interesting point: in pagan temples, statues of male nudes were commonplace. Of course, in Christian times, photos of male nudes were items purchased under-the-counter (until very recently).The photos apparently date from 40-50 years ago, when the "ragazzi" enjoyed and embraced life, and found no problem at all in doffing all of their clothing to appear as they were born!All in all, if you enjoy photos and images of the youthful male nude, by all means put this volume in your library! Michelangelo surely would have!

In this review, I want to focus on one claim that is mind-boggling --- the one claim that tends to upset the whole model we have about "heroin addiction." But let's first examine the question of Dalrymple's credibility to make this claim.Dalrymple spent 18 years as a prison doctor, first in the prison itself, and then in the hospital connected to the prison. In those 18 years, he came to know thousands of addicts, and personally witnessed hundreds of them kicking the habit. So I would say that, unless he has decided to lie, Dalyrmple is a completely credible witness.His claim is that --- contrary to the Received Wisdom -- kicking heroin is no big deal. It takes 2-3 days, and is about as irritating as a case of the flu, or a bad cold. There are NO hallucinations, there is NO danger of death or madness. In fact, it's a lot more dangerous to kick a bad alcohol habit: that's where you get the DT's, and hallucinations, and even patients jumping to their death to escape the terrifying products of their imagination.To say that again: kicking heroin is no big deal.I invite you to browse the other reviews which admit that Dalrymple is right.If so, Western society has been sold a real bill of goods, and the people who began selling it were people as notable as Samuel Coleridge and Thomas De Quincy. Another reviewer wrote these people off as "minor authors." They are not, and were not. I believe you will find that they are both still in print, and have been vastly influential. They were joined, later on, by docs of the 19th-20th centuries who were shooting morphine themselves, and finally were joined by docs of the "Drug Therapy Establishment."After all, kicking the heroin habit is a terrible, terrible ordeal, so we must give them methadone, mustn't we? Whereas, in fact, all you need to do is throw them in jail for three days.Another reviewer complains that Dalrymple doesn't offer encouraging words to people "trying to give up heroin." I think Dalrymple would be full of encouraging words, but he would also be aware that this is a situation where actions speak a thousand times louder than words, and he might even mention the "Mao solution." Faced with 3 million opium addicts, Mao simply announced that they would all be shot. And then he began shooting them, starting with the dealers, but not neglecting the users in the opium dens. The result was highly predictable: millions of Chinese looked at their opium pipe and decided to get out while the getting was good. They didn't need any encouraging words.I would also add some confirmation from my own narrow experience. I lived in Iran for two years, and by the second year my friends trusted me enough to invite me to their *nightly* opium-smoking sessions. I joined in out of curiosity, and was surprised at the opium's effect: I didn't drift off into beautiful opium dreams. I felt more like I'd just had some really strong coffee. So we were up until dawn, time after time.In a few more months, I went home to the USA, and I have to say that I never once felt even the slightest bit addicted to opium. In fact, I remembered Basil Bunting's story about the times when he and Yeats were doing a lot of opium in London. After many years of this, Yeats showed up looking scared. "You know, Bunting, they say this stuff can be addictive!" Bunting thought for a moment, and said, "We'd better quit, then." And they did.No snake pit. No hallucinations. No problem. People inject heroin because they find pleasure in it.And that's a mighty big piece of news.

The debate over the translations here makes a lot of sense in light of Joseph Frank's judgment that Pushkin's poetry is simply untranslatable. Since I don't read Russian, I can't argue this point, but Frank may well be correct. I think there is at least one other poet who simply cannot be translated, the Persian Hafez. That is to say, various translators may indeed produce "translations" of Pushkin or Hafez, but what gets lost in the process is "everything." Joseph Frank says that so much depends on the choice of exact words in Russian, and the music which arises from mingling their sounds, that you really have to read it in the original. I think the same goes for Hafez.I have both translations, Nabokov's and Falen's. Falen's makes better reading, and Nabokov's is more accurate, but they are both failures. According to Frank, they have to be failures.In contrast, Shakespeare's language gets lost in translation, but there's a lot more to Shakespeare --- the characters, the stories, the psychology --- that does survive translation.If you want something of Pushkin's that DOES translate well, try his short stories, such as the Tales of Belkin.

One of the biggest shocks of my life came around 1979, when I finally got my little Apple II and dot-matrix printer to screech out a portrait of Winston Churchill. I took it to work, and showed it to a girl working next door: "Isn't this neat?" I asked. "Who is that?" replied she.So I guess Winston Churchill was already Ancient History by 1980. :-(Get this book, and read it! You can read it slowly, in snippets. I learned a lot from it. I had always known that Churchill had some very famous barbed remarks for "Lady Astor." Here, I learned that "Lady Astor" was one of those highly-unpleasant females of the "rich" species, born in Virginia, who somehow managed to get elected to the British House of Commons, and join a faction which supported Hitler and the Nazis!That puts a little more zing into Churchill's reply to Lady Astor's lovely remark: "If I were married to you, Winston, I'd put poison in your tea."Churchill's instant reply, "If I were married to you, Nancy, I'd drink it."

This is a book written by a young man who is only 19. It is full of fascinating, open-source stuff. But it is badly written and terribly organized. You can get the idea when the author refers to someone within Saddam's government as "Mr. Al-Tikriti." Come now! This is hardly a unique identifier. Anyone who has seen the playing cards distributed to coalition forces can tell you that almost everyone in Saddam's inner circle had the tribal surname of "Al-Tikriti."So: the first thing needed to improve this book is a list (at the front of the book) of the characters who play an important role. If possible, with pictures.The second thing needed to improve this book is a timeline (at the front of the book), putting all the important events on a chronological straight line to avoid reader confusion.The third major thing needed is for the author himself to follow some sort of timeline. He apparently does, but jumps around pretty much at will, so that a paragraph beginning "In 1987..." is immediately followed by a paragraph beginning "In 1994..."On the upside, there is just so much dirt in here! There is so much that really needs to be investigated in detail! I know a little bit about the career of Ramzi Youcef -- happily a prisoner of the US as I write these words. To what extent was he an Iraqi agent? And the Oklahoma terrorist bombing! I'll just mention one thing that really raises my eyebrows, in retrospect: the M.O. (modus operandi). It was another huge TRUCK BOMB. Go through the history of these "cunning, intelligent" international terrorists and TIME AFTER TIME their M.O. is to put a big bomb in a truck and drive it to the scene of the crime. Certainly they did that in the first attack on the World Trade Center. And what did we see in Oklahoma? They put a big bomb in a truck and drove it to the scene of the crime.This book is well worth looking into, but it really needs a complete rewrite. It appears the author rushed it into print himself because he felt the information was time-critical. I won't argue with him on that. I'm not sure exactly how much stuff he has gotten right. But I do have a strong suspicion that the two million documents being released by the U.S. government even now are going to bring a lot of support to this 19yo young man.That is to say, the "democratic wing of the Democratic party" has fallen so hard for the "NO WMD" and "NO CONNECTION" non-facts that there is going to be egg all over their faces by the end of the day. To think -- that such people were celebrating the likes of Michael Moore when people like Saddam and Osama were plotting the next terror strikes against America.It is really nice to notice that the "Saddam" half of that partnership is in jail, while the "Osama" half sneaks from cave to cave in Waziristan.

I am by now a big fan of Bourdain The Writer. As others have noted here, he has been naturally gifted with the ability to tell a story and make a telling phrase.The recipes seem to be excellent, although I can't try my hand at some of his legendary sauces because I can't find a source for VEAL in Chiang Mai.Well, in any case, this is not your ordinary, every-day cookbook. The one recipe I did try to make was the yummy Salade Nicoise (I think I even managed to find anchovies in Chiang Mai, although the label was entirely in Danish and Doubts Remain). But, no question: everyone gobbled it right up. It was yummy.Beyond all doubt, I think I would like to have a meal in Mr. Bourdain's restaurant. But a lot of his recipes are exactly what they seem to be -- complex and interesting recipes which pros can turn out without blinking --- while the person who cooks at home may be pining for something simpler.Still, all in all, you can't have my copy!!! :-)

This wonderful (heavy) book is a tremendous achievement, especially for people who can't manage the time or money to go and visit these magnificent shrines in person.The photos are fantastic, the text is informative, but the real stars of the shows are the cathedrals themselves, which I consider the most wonderful examples of architecture created by man. Well, maybe Ancient Greece should share the honor.Some lighter reading to understand these monuments of grace and strength: Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earthand David MacAuley'sCathedral: The Story of Its Construction.Did you know that the "ignorant Europeans" who built these masterpieces typically set aside a hundred years to complete the project?

For years I have been repeating the old idea that Somerset Maugham was not quite an "A" writer, but was certainly among the best of the "B" writers. I think this idea originated with Maugham himself.But the passage of years has made this idea look ridiculous. Quick, now: name ANY author in English who wrote better short stories? Maybe we should widen the playing field: name any author anywhere who wrote better short stories? In the second case, I come up with Chekhov (another doctor).But, leaving all thoughts of competition and comparison behind, please read "The Luncheon" or "The Ant and the Grasshopper" for a side of Maugham rarely mentioned: he can be as funny as any man on the planet ever was. He may be skewering a victim while doing so, but that's hardly illegal. "The Fall of Edward Bernard" is another world-class story, as is "Honolulu."You can't go wrong here. If you find yourself gnashing your teeth when the book is finished, relax. There are three more volumes.Highest possible recommendation!!

It took me a while to learn to love Dvorak -- I enjoyed his "New World Symphony" as a lad, and in middle-age I became a huge fan of his Cello Concerto (I still am!).This boxed set is your entree to the world of Dvorak's symphonies, and they are all excellent. I enjoy Dvorak's symphonies more than Brahms's. Brahms wrote excellent music as well, but Dvorak is very tough competition!Right now, I would especially recommend Symphony #4. Terrif.

I originally picked up this book with the best of intentions: to read all nine (or eleven) volumes, in belated "revenge" for not having majored in philosophy. Those intentions are now being stretched over a longer period of time.I have no doubt that this is the "academic standard" in the history of philosophy. You can tell, because Father Copleston makes a habit of citing foreign languages without translation. This used to be (and still may be) the distinguishing mark of an academic: just put it down in French, German, Latin, or Greek, and if the unwashed masses don't get it, tough. In particular, I would highly recommend that you learn the Greek alphabet before embarking on this adventure. Not the Greek language, mind you, but just enough of the alphabet to spell out all the Greek words which Copleston throws at you.The book is a major accomplishment; the fruit of a titanic intellectual effort. Still, there is competition in this rather small niche, most obviously Bertrand Russell's "History of Western Philosophy" (in one volume!) and Anthony Gottlieb's "The Dream of Reason." Quite frankly, for readers who are not professional philosophers (or students of philosophy) I might recommend one of those two books. Bertrand Russell's book gives you a bonus, in including huge swathes of real history to put his philosophical history in context, while Gottlieb is smart, diverting, and original.Father Copleston (a Jesuit) is smart as a tack, but had no intention of being diverting or original. It is really an advantage that Copleston's bias is openly declared: he is a Catholic who holds that the true philosophy is the Scholastic philosophy of the Middle Ages --- properly modernized, of course. So you won't expect him to dwell on people like Pseudo-Dionysius. And his essay on Plato's "Doctrine of the Forms" is, indeed, a major intellectual undertaking. It is so good that the acute reader can spot Plato's errors all over the place, such as Plato's assumption that the only real knowledge was of things that are eternally true and unchanging. That, if you stop to think about it, is a whale of an assumption. To take a trivial example, we all generalize from the frogs we have seen to an "Ideal Frog" --- it's part of recognizing reality. But it really plays havoc when we try to understand evolution, and must realize that there is no "Ideal Frog," or recognize that the "Ideal Frog" is constantly changing, over a period of time which we may not be able to comprehend. So Plato made it hard for humankind to understand evolution.And then, later on, in the chapter on "The State," you understand it when Copleston enthusiastically joins Plato's demands for censorship of the arts, and the rule of the Philosopher-King. After all, I am not the first person to have seen the Catholic Index of Prohibited Books --- and the Papacy --- as attempts to bring Plato's ideas about the state to fruition.I guess, in the end, I would like to describe a choice for the reader who is interested in the history of philosophy.Choice A would be Lord Bertie, who squeezes it all into one magisterial volume:A History of Western Philosophy.Choice B would be Anthony Gottlieb:The Dream of Reason: A History of Philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance. The drawback here is that Gottlieb is only half-done.Choice C would be to go whole hog and get the entire set by Copleston. You are not required to read every word, but the whole vast and detailed panorama is at your fingertips. If you're on a budget, you could always buy one volume a month, or something like that. :-)Good luck, and happy reading!

Well, this is a book from Roger Kimball -- so of course it's worth reading. Beware, however: this particular volume is written on the level of graduate seminars; it is most definitely not a popular treatment for a mass audience.This book is a collection of book reviews: not one-paragraph notices, but long and thorough reviews of books. It begins with a review of Aron's classic "Opium of the Masses" but then proceeds to a sort of mini-history of philosophy, done through book reviews.In my humble opinion, he wastes a lot of costly ink on mountebanks such as Hegel and Marx, and somehow manages to downplay the greatest working philosopher of the 20th century, Santayana.In sum, great food for the hungry brain! :-) You get your Raymond Aron here, and your Plutarch, your Daumier, and your Bagehot. Then you get your Descartes, your Schiller, your Hegel, and your Schopenhauer. Free bonus: Strange Soren Kierkegaard! :-) After that, you get your Santayana, your Wittlessstein, your Lord Bertie, and your David Stove. (Who he??)In conclusion, you get your Trollope, your P.G. Wodehouse, your Tocqueville, and a few others.Frankly I would recommend reading Santayana's "The Life of Reason" as you read this book. I think mankind as a species has wasted enough time on Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Heidegger, but if you follow my reading plan you can ignore witless me and hear what Roger Kimball and George Santayana have to say! :-)

These days, Epictetus barely survives as a footnote in discussions of Stoicism, yet there are signs that he may be due for a comeback. Oddly enough, I found my way to this book via Tom Wolfe'sA Man in Fulland Roy Abraham Varghese'sThe Wonder of the World: A Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God.Although my path to finding this book may have been odd, I am very happy with the result. One could hardly hope for a clearer exposition of Epictetus. And the book becomes more interesting when read with Varghese's, because Varghese offers a pretty convincing demonstration that there is a God who created and sustains the universe. Epictetus is of the same opinion.Now, Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher who lived around 100-200 AD. He had apparently heard almost nothing of Christianity, but he was quite sure about the nature of God (or Zeus, or The Force, or The Great Spirit). This is something I had missed about Stoicism (or Late Stoicism), and Dr. Long does a great job of demonstrating and explicating it. I suppose you could call it another instance of Deism, which is apparently a firm belief in (God, Zeus, The Force, etc.) which exists apart from any religion based on divine revelation (Christianity, Islam, and Judaism come to mind).However this all works out, I suspect that the "Gang of Four" --- the militant atheists who have all published extremely militant books in the past year or two --- may have made a truly glorious error in their timing, because it seems to be getting harder and harder to be an atheist.Two other books to consult areThe Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific PretensionsandThe Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth.But the book to consult about Epictetus is this one!

This is a short, fascinating, and thought-provoking read -- something that's always hard to find!Fascinating, even eerie parallels between Churchill and Reagan: well, everyone will have his own favorites. Here are mine.First, public speaking. They both wrote their own speeches and slaved over them. Churchill wrote on 4" x 8" paper, Reagan on 4" x 6" cards. They both practiced their speeches almost to the point of memorization, with the same result: they sounded spontaneous and convincing to their audiences. They both made speeches which changed men's minds. Carter, Johnson, and Nixon were incapable of such a thing.Second, their marriages. Churchill's first marriage, Reagan's second -- both were Total Love Relationships, with absolute loyalty on both sides, the kind of love Walt Disney teaches us to dream about.There are many other fascinating parallels (and non-parallels) between these two great leaders, but I'll leave them for you to discover as you read this VERY stimulating book!

Well, to make it simple, take the review from "Publisher's Weekly" and throw it in the trash.I don't usually take to "graphic novels," but this extraordinary book gives the reader the COMPLETE story of those dam*ed "protocols" in a format which can be comfortably read in a few hours. And, frankly, I would not want to read a book of 500 or 1,000 pages telling me this story.Eisner, with great skill and dexterity, put the whole tale into a small number of fascinating pages. And he produced a real work of art, which is going on my bookshelf right next to Malcolm Hay's "Europe and the Jews."Highest possible recommendation!!!

I have previously ventured the opinion that Hilary Hahn has recorded the finest performance of the Barber Violin Concerto. Now Kyoko Takezawa challenges her, and I can't really call a winner. They are both brilliant!This CD has the advantage of the Barber Cello & Piano Concertos as well, so it's a real winner!

Martin Luther didn't think very highly of the Jews. In fact, he wrote this Jew-bashing pamphlet when he was quite old, and finally "fed up" with those ornery people, who kept resisting conversion and even (have they no shame!) attempting to convert Christians to Judaism!! How ornery and sneaky can you get?!?!?What makes this particular publication particularly offensive is that the publishers did not choose to re-print Luther's rants by way of (say) exposing Luther as a Jew-hater. No. They write their forewords very, very carefully, but they make it clear that they re-printed this book in order to spread Luther's message and try to make it more widely available to good Christian folks.Maybe it's just me, but I get particularly rabbity when the "love-your-enemy" folks decide to drop that pretense and go in for a little genuine hate.

Just by luck, this book arrived at my house the same day asHinduism : A Very Short Introduction. The second book looks interesting, but this translation of the Upanishads is the one that grabbed me and wouldn't let go!Mr. Easwaran is a master of lucid thinking and writing. He very deftly plunged me into the traditions of Hindu philosophy / theology. I later learned that he had become something of a guru, but what I would call a "good guru" as opposed to the frauds driving Rolls-Royces, or leading their troops to mass suicide in the jungles. Not a bit of this could be scented at Easwaran's web site, where he eagerly provides free materials so there is no need to buy his books.This book also gave me further insight into Buddhism, which can be seen, in some ways, as a revolt against Hinduism. The Hindus have a supreme Godhead; Buddhism declares the question of God irrelevant. What is particularly fascinating is that both Hinduism and Buddhism attach great importance to meditation: the Hindus hoping to reach "samadhi," while the Buddhists hope to reach "nirvana." The problem is that "samadhi" is viewed as a mystical union with God, while "nirvana" is an ecstatic state which completely frees you from the cycle of birth, death, and re-birth.This book was also another lesson in the vast influence of Indian culture on what used to be called Indochina. There's a huge amount of Chinese influence in Indochina as well, especially in Vietnam. but the Chinese influence in Thailand has been more in the area of cuisine and business than in the area of religion.I found this to be a very deft and appealing translation of the "Upanishads" which makes very interesting reading.For people interested in religion, the highest possible recommendation!

I have been living in Thailand for eight years now, and will never be parted from this book.When I was in the US, I was frequently frustrated by the inability to easily buy all of the necessary ingredients (fish sauce, fermented bean sauce, phrik kii nuu, and all the rest). But when I began living in Chiang Mai, I was able to discover that the recipes are all delicious!Some recipes are vastly complicated, especially the ones which recommend pounding up your own curry pastes. I did this exactly one time, and the results were A++. But these days I can get an A by going down to the local market and handing the curry-paste vendor 25 cents for a small plastic bag full of the stuff SHE makes (and it's very good).If you can do this, then a seemingly complex recipe like "panaeng muu" becomes the simplest thing in the world -- and, trust me, this pork curry will disappear. "Constantly good, constantly gone" seems to apply here! :-)Of course, I would add some items to this book for people who are living in Thailand. Probably the first would be "Roast Loin of Pork." Alas, it is very hard to get pork in the US, unless you count bacon and pork chops, and forget the rest of the animal.But --- if you are interested in Thai cooking --- the place to begin is here. This is a superb book!

The first volume in this series was superb, and I was a little worried about the second volume. "The Years of Ordeal" were years when Dostoevsky wrote just about nothing at all (a few letters excepted) so I was worried that it might be tedious reading.Not a bit of it! We get detailed discussion of the investigation --- Dostoevsky at 27 was on trial for his life and supposedly condemned to death. In this book you will find out exactly what happened and how Dostoevsky was shipped off for four years of hard labor in Sibera, and how he came brutally and abruptly face-to-face with the moral horror of the Russian peasantry in prison. Their behavior --- drunkenness, habitual theft, constant fighting, etc. --- was bad enough, but Dostoevsky learned something worse right off the bat: they hated him and everybody from his class. Much to his surprise, after his rose-colored glasses were smashed to bits, he found himself hating them right back --- and out went the Christian socialism he had almost committed treason for. Dostoevsky was still a Christian, however, and this experience of fierce hatred for a class he had previously romanticized led to a genuine "conversion experience" and the foundation of the firm convictions which served him for the rest of his life --- although he took "a long, long time" to completely work through his conversion experience.All is this is developed and told by Joseph Frank in a completely fascinating way. It may not be as thrilling as "Crime & Punishment," but it sure beats a lot of modern novels in holding reader interest! Particularly fascinating is a detailed and very plausible account of how Dostoevsky finally managed to establish working relations with the peasants he hated so much; he had to learn to behave as they wanted and expected him to behave --- as a gentleman he could be as strict as he wanted with the peasants, but he could never commit the error of (a) pretending to be a peasant himself, or (b) failing to treat them as fellow human beings. They wanted him to act and be noble, but without a hint of nose-in-the-air snobbism. It sounds like a very delicate line to tread, but Dostoevsky finally caught on.There is way too much to summarize here. These books have won a basketful of literary and scholarly prizes, and are very much worth your attention.

Ah, Ancient Greece! Where wise men discussed philosophy and science at dignified academies, where young noblemen came to study and improve themselves...Where citizens in the agora held lively discussions about wisdom with Socrates the gadfly...which celebrated the Olympics every four years with dignity and grace, requiring only that the athletes compete in the nude...Well, I guess that's not a complete picture. This fascinating portrayal of "the REAL Olympics" shows a lot more of the very human nature of those Ancient Greeks. It's going too far to call the Olympics a five-day debauch, but there was that aspect to it. A lot of olive oil was massaged into young athletic bodies, and a lot of wine was guzzled by the spectators, almost all of whom had to stand in the blazing sun (without hats --- it was a rule), frequently falling victim to sunstroke or heat exhaustion while the superb professional athletes raked up all the gold and all the glory. When night fell, and more wine had been guzzled, there was sex aplenty for sale at Olympia, beautiful women and handsome young men both plying their trades. Your hotel? Why, that was a blanket on the grass. Your restaurant? Cart vendors. Your latrine? Well, that would be the dried-up river bed over yonder... Shower facilities and baths? Are you kidding?The 40,000 spectators arrived smelling pretty ripe, and that smell continued growing riper. Add in the fumes from a zillion cook-fires, plus that river bed over yonder...But who cared? This was the OLYMPICS!! The games here had a run of about 1200 years.The remedy for hangover? Make sure you upchuck everything before going to bed! (Would that work??!)In sum, this is a very entertaining portrait of the Ancient Greeks when they weren't posing for marble statues --- it's much more a portrait of the Ancient Greeks we find on ancient drinking cups. And the portrait of professional athletes of staggering wealth being cheered on by people who had a whole lot less wealth --- why, it may even remind some of modern times.

In 1992, which is (ahem) EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO, Kurzweil published "The Age of Intelligent Machines."In 2001, he published "The Age of Spiritual Machines."In 2005, he published "The Singularity is Near."In all those years (decades) I have not seen ANY progress made in the domain of "intelligent machines." (I'm still running Windows, and Mac freaks are still bragging about their Macs. :-) )(And, no, I do not count machines which can "sort of" take dictation, with no understanding of language, "intelligent.")This guy reminds me of Paul Ehrlich, who made a fine living predicting the end of the world from overpopulation over the same period of time. I think he did 3 or 4 books as well, all of them totally wrong.Wake me when computers are sentient, and can speak a natural language. Or, to put it simply, wake me when I can put a human child in front of a "machine" and ask the machine "Is this a boy or a girl?" and get the right answer.

This book just arrived today, and I obviously haven't read it all. I probably never will, since I intend to use it mainly as a reference work.And I just did that. While reading through "The Forgotten Man" I found a reference to the Compact Clause of the Constitution. Uh, what's that? Well, let's try the new book....good, "Compact Clause" is in the index, and it leads to an excellent short article on a clause in the Constitution which forbids states to make agreements (or "compacts") with other states without the approval of Congress.I also looked at the discussion of the Tenth Amendment, that most unjustly neglected and abused part of the Constitution, and was surprised that I didn't find a rant. I found, instead, another excellent article which described (at just the right level of detail) the original meaning of the Tenth Amendment, what has happened to it in the Supreme Court, and an astute description of what it apparently means NOW.This is a balanced, judicious, and scholarly effort, which must certainly have been a labor of love on the part of all the contributors. I would strongly recommend it for ANY library in America, public or private. It is a tremendous achievement!

While this film may not make it into the "classic" category, I've surely seen a lot of movies which were much, much worse. This one is colorful, well-acted, and tries its very best to do justice to the sprawling plot of Alexandre Dumas' 1200-page novel.Of course, as any screenwriter has learned, it's not just difficult but impossible to shoehorn a huge novel into a film. Therefore, entire swathes of the novel's plot wind up in the waste-basket, characters are blended together, and so on. The one alteration I found most interesting was the story of the grand love affair between the Count (Edmond Dantes) and Mercedes. In the novel, the two lovers face up to the decades of betrayal and part ways. As I recall, Mercedes retires to the country or goes into a convent, while Edmond frees his "Greek slave" and marries her. In this movie, Edmond and Mercedes forgive one another and go on to perpetual bliss. (There is no "Greek slave" --- she wound up in the wastebasket with all the other stuff, including the lesbian runaways.)I really think (and hope) that this whole business of turning novels into movies is going to learn something from Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" --- or from the TV mini-series. Producers should STOP chopping and maiming the original story to cram it into a narrow time frame: they should take just as much time as needed to tell the complete story.Of course, that's just me sayin'. :-)This is a good movie! But it could have been a lot better!

I remember the first time I read this book, and its uncanny presentation of something which has become a central fact of American and European life: the completely strange alliance between the ultra-left faction and the Islamic jihadis.Since then, events have confirmed Horowitz over and over again. George Galloway is a shining example. Jimmy Carter is an admirer of Hamas: he wanted to go and shake their hands but they refused (probably having figured out that Carter's credibility is around -700 these days). And just this weekend, a grand demonstration against Israel, organized by (guess who?) Code Pink, ANSWER, CAIR, and other representatives of people who used to love the USSR, as well as other front groups for the Muslim Brotherhood.Read this book, and shake your head in amazement and pity. I mean to say, the very least that one might expect is that ultra-leftist feminists would have NOTHING to do with Islamic Fundamentalism, not to mention the routine mutilation of female children. But everywhere you go, there is nothing but the very loud Sound Of Silence.The critical thing seems to be: "Hate America." If you pass this litmus test, you are welcome at the party.Speaking for myself, I don't find America (or any country) to be perfect, but it seems terribly, terribly obvious that people in America are, shall we say, better off than people living in Zimbabwe, or Syria, or Saudi Arabia, or Iran. They have more freedom, they have better food to eat, they have MUCH better health-care --- and yet, some people claim to hate the place.You cannot expect people to be rational!A really brilliant job of political analysis. Don't miss it.

Frankly, I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, since lady-boys are not at all my type (much less 12yo lady-boys). But, just as a person, the 12yo lady-boy won my heart.And that is perhaps the crucial thing about this film. Folks who come prepared to condescend will likely wind up wishing they knew more people like Maxi. Sure, he's an effeminate gay boy, and he's only 12, but... how to put it?....he's a great guy, sincere, affectionate, hard-working, and his dreams are firmly fixed on the stars. To sum it up: he's a believable character, and very sympathetic.Now you have to get ready for the "Romeo & Juliet" part of the story. Maxi lives with a family of criminals, and he falls madly in love with an honest cop. To say any more would spoil the story, except that I will say this: the story is about love, not about sex. In the end, both Maxi and Victor have been seen in tears. The affection is very real.Frankly, I don't regard this as a "quirky little film." It is a film about real human feelings. (When I was living in Iran, I had the same experience of a young boy falling in love with me! It happened during a vacation trip, and so it was short, but neither of us ever forgot it.) I don't think I need to repeat myself, but it was all about affection, and never about everyone's favorite subject. The last I heard, a dozen years later, Arman was in medical school --- and I was overjoyed to hear it.In precisely the same way, Maxi and Victor come to care for one another, and to care ABOUT one another.And that's really what life is about.

I enjoyed reading the first seven chapters of this book, although in retrospect they were a bit wordy. The Big Bang is a very solid scientific theory by now, and there is indeed a great puzzlement about the origin of life. The authors blend this with a bit of Anthropic Principle, a dash of chopped toad, and arrive at the conclusion that the universe, and life, were created by an eternal, intelligent force which we cannot understand.So far, so good. I have no problem, I have an open mind. Who knows? I think I'm a Theist rather than an Atheist.But in Chapter 8, the authors simply lose it in an enormous way. "We have found," they chortle, "A God who is consistent with the God of the Bible!""Consistent" is a very strange, weak word to use. But they forge right ahead and make a short list of "Religions That Might Be True," a list which includes Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. (!) At this point, I shut the book. Even the most elementary logic student, one still figuratively sucking his thumb, could point out that the authors "forgot" about the most obvious choice of all: "None of the Above."We have heard so much propaganda about the heathen and the pagan that it comes as a surprise to many when they learn that pagans were no strangers to a belief in God. You might even squeeze Plato into that camp, but no squeezing at all is needed for the Late Stoics such as Epictetus, or the neo-Platonists, especially Plotinus. In fact, this is becoming a new area of interest for me: pagans who believed in God. Certainly Aristotle accepted his own theory of the Unmoved Mover, happily borrowed by Christian theologians.However, as long as this list might turn out to be, it is obviously not exhaustive, and there are doubtless many other candidates which would fit under "None of the Above."That is to say, a belief in God does NOT require us to accept some sadistic fiend who would subject his own creatures to eternal torture, or any of the other particular weirdnesses of the three Abrahamic religions.In my opinion, a huge fail. A book I found much more interesting: Pope Benedict'sIntroduction to Christianity (Communio Books).

Malcolm Hay, a profoundly good man, wrote this book to document, once and for all, the history of Christian anti-Semitism (or: "Jew-hatred").The whole history is here, folks. We have to start with the difficult facts that (1) all early Christians, including Jesus and St. Paul, were Jews, and (2) the entire "Christian Bible" had been written by Jews. Given these primary facts, it would seem insane, or preposterous, to allege that these very same Christians, and their children) would become the biggest Jew-haters in the world. [I am editing this review, because we now have a new champion, it appears. Muslim hatred of the Jews is so omnipresent and so ill-concealed that it is now holding First Place in Global Jew-Hating. That, of course, means Last Place Among So-Called "Civilized" Nations.]But it did indeed happen. At the beginning, everyone was Jewish -- Jew and Christian alike. But the differences in faith obviously created a schism. And so the "Christian Jews" were faced with the eternal problem of defining their own, separate, identity -- and various articles of the Jewish faith got tossed overboard. Just as one example, circumcision: mandatory for Jews, it was first discarded by St. Paul during his successful attempt to convert the Roman and Greek pagans (who, for obvious reasons, had no desire to endure this useless and painful surgery as adult males). That was just the beginning. In the end, circumcision became a way to identify persons of differing religions -- Christians were not circumcised, while Jews and Muslims were.Are human beings petty, or not? Malcolm Hay asks many of these questions as he moves beyond the early schism, and begins discussing such major Jew-haters as St. John Chrysostom. This marvellous "saint" preached and wrote a whole series of "Homilies Against the Jews." I could quote them here, but it would be too offensive for community standards. But I will note one curious fact, that hardly anyone else seems to have noticed: the Roman Catholic Church has finally disowned those "Homilies Against the Jews." If you go to a good religious library, you can often find the old edition of Chrysostom, which contains all those nasty volumes. The newer edition simply cuts the homilies against the Jews, without a word.As we move forward into history, into the Middle Ages, we begin to see people (i.e. Jews) being burned alive.But I'm not going to tell you the entire story. You need to get this book and read it yourself.And then look over your shoulder to see the latest world religion which has based itself on hating Jews.

I have to begin by confessing that I have refused to even look at Medieval Philosophy for most of my fairly long life. When I was just a boy at St. John's College, I quit after one year. My boyish self thought that he had absorbed the Greeks and the Romans, and had no wish to waste time with...gack...Dark Age Idiots squabbling over how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.Well.I have now finished Vol. I of this history, and embarked on Vol. II, and I must say that I am thoroughly enjoying the tale so far! Is this because the philosophy is intrinsically interesting, or because of Frederick Copleston's sublime presentation and discussion of that philosophy?Make no mistake here: Copleston was one of the best teaching-writers who ever lived. (Gosh! Those Jesuits! They seem to do this over and over again!!)Big surprise #1: Augustine becomes my favorite philosopher! Well, at least for these points, which I will summarize from memory: "Many people doubt the evidence of the senses as inherently unreliable. Well, we have all seen an oar in the water, and are aware of optical illusions, but anyone who wants to throw out all of our information from the senses is making a terrible mistake. We learn everything from what we see and sense of the world. In the same way, we cannot trust the statements of other men; they are often unreliable. But anyone who insists on tossing all of the knowledge obtained from other men is an idiot: our human knowledge has grown great because of what we can see, and what we can hear from other men."Somehow, I want to place this beside Immanuel Kant's love of the starry firmament. (How did Kant KNOW that the night sky was filled with stars, aside from opening his eyes and LOOKING?)The second major surprise has been to discover that medieval philosophy was not just blind dogmatism and blinkered prejudice. The philosophers of pre-modern Europe were indeed groping in the dark (as are we), but they did have Plato and the Bible to help them, and they INSISTED on trying to discuss them rationally.We should not spit on the graves of these men. They were devout, and sometimes wildly mistaken, but they were doing their very best to take Plato and Aristotle and make something BETTER. At the very least, it is a story with a compelling human interest.Which is just about the last thing I expected from this book!Have a look for yourself some day! Of course, you have to begin with Volume I to make sense of Volume II. Just 5-10 pages a day will get you there, if you are patient and persevering. :-)

As another reviewer astutely noted, this version of the Bible is well-suited to secular classrooms. In fact, that's where I met this book, as an assigned text in a course at UC Santa Barbara given by one of the wisest men I have ever been lucky enough to know. (Douwe Stuurman is how I remember his name, many years later.)What you get here is basically two (two!) classics in one! The Bible itself, and just about the only translation which has ever been hailed as a masterpiece: the King James Version.The book begins just as you would expect: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth," and, before five more pages have gone by, it is dealing with the mysterious facts of human sexuality ("they knew they were naked") and the downright evil of human murder ("Am I my brother's keeper?")This is an important book, quite obviously a cornerstone or foundation of that disappearing thing we call "Western civilization." I recommend this book heartily to all readers, but I would note that I am not making that recommendation from a fundamentalist perspective. Not at all.Please indulge me. Shakespeare is not literally true, in every syllable. But he writes magnificently, and he is very often, magnificently RIGHT. ("DON'T KILL YOURSELF OVER FIRST LOVE." "DON'T GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING TO YOUR CHILDREN BEFORE YOU DIE." "DON'T MURDER YOUR LOVING WIFE BECAUSE OF SOME LYING SNAKE." "DO NOT MURDER YOUR WAY TO POWER.")In somewhat the same way, the Bible is not literally true, in every syllable. But it is magnificently written, and it is often magnificently RIGHT. ("HONOR YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER." "DO NOT KILL." "DO NOT GET DIVORCED." "THE UNIVERSE HAS A BEGINNING, AND IT HAS AN END." "YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A GOD WHO LOVES YOU.")It is most certainly "food for thought." At the very least.But neither the Bible nor Shakespeare is suitable for a ten-paragraph "review." Some things do not boil down to Cliff's Notes.

I harbor a grudge against the people who actually voted for Obama in 2008: they actually forced me to learn more about this narcissist moron than I ever wanted to. I have read a lot of the books, includingObama's America: Unmaking the American Dreambut this video really bears the palm away.Obama, like many foolish generals, finds himself fighting the last war. That would be "anti-colonialism," especially in Kenya and Indonesia. He seems to have no idea at all that America was never a colonialist power, or an imperialist power. America does not tell other countries what to do; it liberates them.I guess Obama could have been a good centrist president, but that didn't fit in with his foolish ideas.Watch this video and see how he developed his foolish ideas. It's a masterpiece.

Sometimes, it takes time to identify our heroes. When I was a child in the fifties, Ike seemed like Mr. Bland, the King of mindless conformism. (Please note again that I was a CHILD. :-) )Once JFK was in the White House, I don't think I devoted any thought to Eisenhower until, oddly enough, I was working in Teheran, which had a long, large boulevard named after Eisenhower. This simple fact made me stop and think. There were certainly no streets named after LBJ and Nixon. What was so special about this old duffer who spent his time playing golf?Well, of course I had to grow up, and sooner or later try to rank the 20th-century Presidents, and one thing I found extraordinary about Eisenhower was what he had done BEFORE becoming President.As a factual example: the outbreak of World War II caused a meteoric rise in Ike's career, and before long he was in charge of the renamed War Planning Department --- the Operations Planning Department. Working directly under George C. Marshall, Ike had 107 officers reporting to him and an unparalleled view of what global warfare meant in his time.This is where I start getting a little scared, since I cannot even imagine running a huge, detailed department like that. Could you?It got even "worse," and more "terrifying," when Ike was put in charge of the European Theater of Operations (in London) and his life suddenly changed forever --- he had stepped onto the world stage and was a public figure ever after.Then he planned, organized and commanded Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy which eventually put Hitler out of business for good. Through it all, his vast spidery intelligence was crucial, but so were his terrific public relations efforts in Britain --- and, above all, the indomitable will of George C. Marshall and Dwight David Eisenhower working as a team.Not too bad, for a guy who was 51 on Pearl Harbor Day. If he had died on that day, he would mean nothing to history but would be completely forgotten. As things turned out, though, his childhood virtues ( honesty, self-reliance, integrity, fear of God, and ambition ) served him very well. More than that, they served our country very well. Ike went on to guide us through the critical postwar years, settled the Korean War, and was overall a trusted and capable President.Highly recommended reading.

This is a book which may actually change your mind. It made me change mine, which is fairly unusual.The book presents an argument for God which does not require you to check your brain at the door. Varghese does not ask you to take anything at all on faith. The tone of the book is casual, even conversational, but clearly it is the result of many years of dedicated study and hard work.I suspect this book will take some time to attract public notice, if only because it slaughters so many sacred cows. The most important of these may be, "Well, belief in God may have worked for people in the olden days, but we moderns have advanced beyond that, and are now happily facing the future as `brights' (Dawkins' new term for atheists)."Another endangered cow is the idea that disproving, or discrediting, Christianity (or Islam, or Judaism) automatically disproves the idea of God. A moment's thought will show anyone that this is absurd. Just for example, a Muslim rejects Christianity but does not reject the idea of God.One last bovine living in fear might be the idea that modern philosophy is automatically better than older philosophy. Varghese's team consists of Avicenna, Maimonides, Thomas Aquinas, and an Indian philosopher named Madhvacharya. (I'll take them against Heidegger, Sartre, and Derrida any old day!) These four great philosophers agreed on a set of principles which Varghese calls "The Matrix." Not to be confused with the movie, the Matrix is a set of ideas which enabled the take-off of modern science. The set of ideas includes a creator of infinite intelligence, a world which is something different from the force which created it and sustains it, and the human mind. These three things are DIFFERENT. They do not collapse into one another at "higher levels" of thought. What is most striking is that this model explains why we can understand the world: we and the world have a common creator. (The Ancient Greeks knew this as the Doctrine of the Logos, and it went into Christianity with much other Greek philosophy.)The God presented here is not the God of Christianity (or Islam, or Judaism). He might well be called "The God of the Philosophers" or "The God of the Scientists."In any case, this book made me change my mind. I removed the letter "A" and now consider myself a Theist --- like many of America's Founding Fathers.Suggested companion reading:The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific PretensionsandThe Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth.

"Answered Prayers" was the leading shaggy-dog story of the U.S. literary world for almost two decades. When the first contract for Truman Capote's "masterpiece" was signed, Capote received an advance of $25,000 against delivery in January 1968 -- delivery of a book which would rival Proust's masterpiece, "Remembrance of Things Past," in portraying the aristocracy of our own times.Well, alarms should have gone off immediately -- they should go off whenever ANY writer says that he's goingto "do a Proust." But 1968 came and went, so the publishers gave Capote more money ("substantially" more)for a three-volume masterpiece, now due in 1973. And so on, and so on, until they finally settled ona $1 million advance in 1980, this time payable only on delivery of the manuscript in 1981.So, who says Truman Capote couldn't spin a captivating tale? Look at all the greenery he collected for thisshaggy-dog story of his "final masterpiece!!" :-)Unfortunately, the publishers were not the only parties getting deceived during this fifteen-year escapade.Truman Capote was also deeply involved in deceiving himself. He may have told himself that he was gatheringmaterial for a masterpiece, but he was actually turning himself into the tame lap-dog and court jester of thevery rich. Marcel Proust himself would have warned Capote against such a foolish, self-defeating courseof action.Capote was of course gay, but his new role as lap-dog to wealthy heterosexuals led him to adopt a strange,tortured role familiar to many closeted socialites. As time passes, you start accepting all the straightconventions, and begin dismissing any gay love affairs as trivial, sordid, or merely amusing, while holdingall heterosexual affairs in the highest honor and respect. In the end, the poor lap-dog may even tryto persuade his straight masters that he himself is enthralled with love for a beautiful woman, and starttrying to play that tune -- hitting a lot of false notes but keeping his masters entertained.Unfortunately, all this is on view in "Answered Prayers," where the author's "bisexual" alter ego develops a huge, indeed infinitely large, crush on the mysterious beauty Kate McCloud, and maudlinly dedicates his life torescuing the kidnaped son of his princess, which son is being held in an evil mountain fortress by ogresfrom the Teutonic lands.Even as Capote descended into writing this sort of childish fairy-tale, his self-loathing grewenormously, from his famous Black And White Ball onwards. He danced and sang for the entertainmentof the jet set, and hated himself for it. As he began spinning his shaggy-dog story, his realliterary output fell to nearly zero, while drugs and alcohol moved to center stage. In his more lucidmoments, however, he took his revenge on his trivial "masters" by spilling their secrets in a series ofdevastating short vignettes -- which he brilliantly pretended were chapters from his long-promised,shaggy-dog masterpiece!!It's no such thing, of course: it's an episodic, unstructured, pornographic mess which DID in factaccomplish its unconscious purpose: once Capote began printing excerpts from this "novel," his CafeSociety buddies dropped him like the proverbial hot potato.So Capote was free at last -- to be himself and write whatever he liked. Unfortunately, he had wastedalmost two decades and had a couple of giant monkeys on his back. As things turned out, the next chapterin his life was "Dissolution and Death."It is all very sad, but it is also ironic. If Capote had actually read Proust, this could all have beenavoided, for Proust is a sovereign tonic against social climbing -- his devastating analysis ofthe "top layers" of Parisian society is enough to put anyone off the idea that such people are worthpursuing."Answered Prayers" has some wonderful smutty stories and a lot of gossip about the sex lives of the richand famous. There are some funny jokes and anecdotes of the Marlene Dietrich/Montgomery Clift era. Itis most certainly not in any sense a finished work of art.Curiosity value only!!

Other reviewers have gone into the details, such as the well-known fraudster T. Lobsang Rampa, but this is one of the very best debunkings of "Oriental religions" I have ever read. I have no particular animus against Occidental OR Oriental religions; none of them has convinced me. But I am really very amused by all the "progressive thinkers" trekking to Thailand to discover the "Oriental Way of Truth." It's as though they have been taught (and carefully taught) that there is absolutely nothing worth looking at in the "Occidental Way of Truth."Hm.So --- will you take T. Lobsang Rampa over Thomas Jefferson?

This is really an amazing book for people who have always been curious about St. Thomas Aquinas, but intimidated by the huge bulk of the "Summa Theologica." Peter Kreeft began with hisA Summa of the Summa, which was a shorter version of the big work, and then whittled that book down to the book under review. People interested in Aquinas should probably go just the other way: begin here, and then, if interest persists, go to Kreeft's larger abridgement. If interest persists after that (!), you may be happy to know that you can get the wholeSumma Theologica (Complete & Unabridged)for almost nothing in a Kindle edition.This book is clear and helpful. It's everything you could want in an introduction. Even if you're not religious, you might want to take a peek at the man widely considered the greatest philosopher between Aristotle and Descartes.

Homo homini lupus --- "Man is wolf to man." That's a pretty good subtitle for Hibbert's enthralling history, "The Days of the French Revolution."It is said that Chou-En Lai was asked his opinion of the French Revolution, and gave the enigmatic reply, "Well, it's still too early to tell, isn't it?" Certainly, the Revolution provoked enormous controversy in its own day, and some of that controversy continues down to our own times. After all, what are we to make of statements like this: "In order to ensure public tranquility, two hundred thousand heads must be cut off?" (That was Jean Paul Marat, hater extraordinaire.) Or what are we to think of an eighteen-year-old boy, sentenced to the guillotine for cutting down a "tree of liberty?"But, if the Revolution had its monstrous and horrible days, it is necessary to remember where it came from. And Hibbert does a wonderful job of reminding us that this "man is wolf to man" stuff came in two distinct phases, the first being the centuries of the Ancien Regime, where all of France was divided into legally binding orders: the aristocracy and the church held the lion's share of the wealth while the peasants, representing about 22 million souls out of the total population of 26 million, typically lived on the brink of starvation."Taxes are for the little people" was a concept that the Ancien Regime took SERIOUSLY. Not only were the 22 million peasants exploited at every turn by their "betters," they were expected to pay almost all the taxes (!) - the church and the aristocracy being virtually exempt. This is the mirror image of the situation in most modern societies, where progressive taxation ensures that the wealthy bear the lion's share of the tax burden, and the poor pay little or nothing: try to imagine this situation reversed, where the poor actually support their wealthy and arrogant parasites.More than that, the church was extremely corrupt. Higher-ranking clergy could only be drawn from the aristocracy. While the "common" parish priests were virtually penniless, the bishops and archbishops raked in the money with both claws, assuring that the church was as unjust as the general society. Worse than that, the higher-ranking clergy was known to spend this money on extravagant living and debauchery.Similarly, army officers could only be drawn from the aristocracy. Upward mobility hardly existed once citizens had reached the middle class.A final, crushing fact was that France was bankrupt, and headed by a stupid king and a vapid, extravagant queen: Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. (She never did say "Let them eat cake" but her thoughts about the lower classes were hardly affectionate.)Given this situation, what to do? Edmund Burke and many others argued for gradual change, but that idea collides with the attitude of the pig-headed aristocracy, which would not surrender even a millimeter of their unjust privileges. (It is in fact terrifying to read about them doing exactly this during the early days of the Revolution, and to realize that they were simply signing their own death warrants.)As the history progresses, and the starving masses begin to take revenge on their "betters," it becomes clear that the French Revolution was not a series of carefully planned and deftly executed maneuvers. It was the opposite: it was, at several points, a terrifying rule of the mob, and, in general, was almost completely chaotic. The hero of the moment was at the guillotine the next moment: almost none of the principal players emerged with head intact. At some points, the description of the bloody massacres requires a strong stomach, even though Hibbert is not nearly as detailed as Ann Coulter in her recent bookDemonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America. I can't describe what happened without producing a review that Amazon won't print, and maybe that's saying enough.In a way, the advent of Bonaparte was a relief to revolutionary France, which was getting sick to death of bloody massacres caused by intra-revolutionary rivalry, such as the "Montagnards" versus the "Girondists." But, of course, the killing did not stop with the coming of the tyrant Napoleon. It was just beginning.An excellent book, and it has excellent illustrations as well. Highest recommendation!

To this day, Japan refuses to acknowledge history.It does not print accurate history in its schoolbooks, and the national Japanese attitude is an extremely off-putting and whiny one: "We didn't start WWII. We only fought on defense."So: Pearl Harbor goes down the memory hole, and so does the Rape of Nanking. While the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are memorialized year after year by thousands of "innocent Japanese."Once you open this horrifying book by the late Iris Chang, the myth of the "innocent Japanese" will vanish before your eyes. Iris Chang is a very good writer, and she begins her highly informative book with a mini-history of Japan which is worth its weight in gold.She then proceeds to the subject: The Rape of Nanking. She deals with it by imitating the famous film "Rashomon:" she tells the entire story from three different perspectives. These are the perspective of the Japanese (many of them horrified), the perspective of the Chinese victims, and the perspective of the Europeans living in Nanking, who established a "safe zone" for the desperate Chinese and kept copious notes on the Rape of Nanking.The Japanese massacred 300,000 innocent Chinese here. If you want to fetch out your slide rule of evil, you may note that both atomic bombs dropped on Japan did not reach this level of slaughter. If you read this book, you will also note that the massive rape, slaughter and torture carried out by the Japanese during the Rape of Nanking was extremely personal. Women were gang-raped, and then instantly killed (if they were not tortured before death.)This is mandatory reading, especially for zealots who believe that the West is the source of all evil. It is particularly disturbing that the Japanese, unlike the Germans, simply refuse to admit their past actions, which are becoming universally known.More than one Japanese soldier said that they were deliberately trained to be "devils."It is wonderful that the truth emerges at last.

If you scan the reviews of this book, you'll quickly discover that a lot of people hate it. They seem to be a mix of convinced pomos, the devout, and "professional philosophers" who have a Ph.D. but no teaching job. (This is one of the real risks of going for a Ph.D. in philosophy: winding up waiting tables or writing computer software.) I especially admired the review which tried to imply that Stove was a CIA tool. :-)But a lot of other people admire David Stove, including Roger Kimball, who is nobody's fool.A lot of people get worked up over his essay on the intellectual inferiority of women, which is of course historically accurate (as Camille Paglia would agree). I think Stove misses the main reason for this unequal performance, which is largely that the bell curve for males is a lot wider (or longer) than the bell curve for females. So men have more geniuses and more morons. This probably does not completely explain the difference in math ability, but I find it hard to care because I have never accepted the loony idea that men and women are interchangeable parts. Nevertheless, a lot of people get seriously upset by this essay, as if it were illegal even to broach the idea of sexual inequality. (By the way, Jensen in his authoritative book,The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)documented at some length the fact that men and women score equally on intelligence tests.)No, the most interesting essay in here is the one about Idealism ("A Victorian Horror Story"), although the others are well worth a read. Contra Idealism, it seems to me the most obvious thing in the world that human beings have knowledge about the (external) real world. This is not some sort of Primitive Philosophy: it was shared by Avicenna, Maimonides, and St. Thomas Aquinas. It is the matrix which underlies modern science. The idea that the only reality is in your head is the Loony-Tunes idea, defended among others by that "pathological windbag Schopenhauer." (Those are Stove's words, not mine, but I agree!)I don't think that David Stove is the first philosopher to Get Everything Right, but he does write brilliantly and he will make you think. I recommend this book highly.

If I were forced to choose between this book and "Thai Reference Grammar" (Higbie and Thinsan), well: I wouldn't choose. They are both very well-written and well-thought-out books written by people with vast experience.For example, David Smyth was involved in the Linguaphone Thai Course, and then later wrote "Teach Yourself Thai." He is immensely qualified to write the present book, which explains, among other things, why the word "talaat" (= "market") has the second syllable pronounced with the LOW tone and not the FALLING tone!But I must have one petty criticism! (Mustn't I? :-) )This book does not explain how to look up words in a Thai dictionary, not COMPLETELY. The question is: which comes first in a Thai dictionary, PIAK ( = wet) or PRIAP (= compare)?? This book gets it all wrong. The right answer appears in, of all places, "Fundamentals of the Thai Language," that totally ancient book which nevertheless sits in the bookshelves of many farang living in Thailand.The answer is right there! Look in the back! :-)

Other favorites have gone missing, including "Jane," "The Luncheon," "The Three Fat Ladies of Antibes" and a few others.It is a handsomely produced volume, with an excellent selection of Maugham's stories, but, if you want all of them, you will have to look elsewhere. An excellent standard edition isThe Complete Short Stories of W. Somerset Maugham (2 Volumes).

THE PLAGUEI am only reading this book now, at age 65, because I was choked nearly to death with "The Stranger" in my merry school-days. When I was assigned to read it in French III (high-school) it was moderately interesting. But when I had to read it AGAIN in French IV the next year, I figured that was enough. No such luck! I was assigned the same book in college French, twice! By that time, I had my own view of Meursault: a man completely without affect, and a killer.But I kept seeing rave reviews of "The Plague,' and finally picked it up in the excellent Everyman's Library edition:The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays (Everyman's Library). And I got a huge surprise. This is certainly one of the best novels of the 20th century: it is extremely well-written, and packed with interesting characters and incidents, all under the over-arching suspense of Oran under the plague, especially after Oran is placed under quarantine and nobody is allowed to leave.A situation like this is ideal for observing the human character under enormous stress, and this was the biggest surprise for me: Camus' penetrating psychological insights, which always rang true. For example, a doctor separated from his wife by the quarantine would actually spend most of the day thinking of her, rather than the deadly threat he dealt with every day. A journalist trapped in Oran decides to escape to join his wife in Paris: "I don't think I was brought into this world to write newspaper articles, but I may have been brought into this world to live with a woman." An attempted suicide (Cottard) suddenly becomes the most cheerful man in town. Why?This is a gripping novel. You probably suspect that quite a bit of it is grisly; it's impossible to write about plague epidemics from the point of view of a doctor without describing the horrific sufferings of the victims.But above it all ring out loud and clear Camus' views of the modern philosophical dilemmas. He includes some sermons from a Catholic priest, and other points of view, but in the end his main conclusion comes from Dr. Rieux, who simply states that the self-evident shines with its own blazing truth, and the obvious thing is for everyone to pull together before the plague kills half the people in Oran.Reading this magnificent novel immediately put Camus (for me) among the two greatest French novelists of the last century, along with Marcel Proust.Note: if you read French, Amazon sells the original version (La peste (table des mati&egrave;res hyperli&eacute;e) (French Edition)for an excellent price.

...and at a bargain price, too. I am not a "professional music critic." I saw an excellent performance of the "Pathetique" on YouTube (Maestro Chung conducting the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra), and it really surprised me...the Seoul Philharmonic is getting really good and Maestro Chung is no slouch. So I decided to put on the Bernstein version, and was totally blown away. I would sum it up by saying that Maestro Chung rated a strong B+, but alas Maestro Bernstein rated an A+.I recommend this set. The only drawback is the inconvenient packaging :-)

You know, I had serious doubts that I would actually read this five-volume biography of Dostoevsky, and feared that the books would simply become "bookshelf decoration."Not a bit of it. Volume I tells us of D's early life, right up to his arrest and imprisonment for being involved in a plot to set up a small hand-press. (!) He spent a year in solitary awaiting sentencing.Volume II is the "House of the Dead" section of Frank's biography, which covers four years at hard labor in Siberia, followed by service in the Army. It discusses in fascinating detail Dostoevsky's all-important "conversion experience," which more or less coincided with the beginning of his terrifying epileptic attacks. The epilepsy finally got him out of the Army, with retirement pay. And he slowly, slowly, made his way back to St. Petersburg from Siberia. The book also covers Dostoevsky's very unhappy first marriage.In Volume III, a much more mature Dostoevsky sets up a literary journal with his devoted brother Mikhail. Called "Time," it establishes Dostoevsky as a critic and polemicist of note.These volumes are filled with fascinating reflections, such as D's thoughts on "salvation" in purely material terms, something we may be facing in the First World, where suddenly even the poor people are fat, and the only people who don't have a home are the people we refer to as "the homeless:" paranoid schizophrenics, and addicts of one type or another. Dostoevsky remarks that the attainment of all reasonable material desires, without a transcendent belief to support one, can result in the most remarkable unhappiness and perverse striving, and even to a total confusion and loss of purpose.On top of all that, these books are nearly a graduate course in 19th-century Russian literary culture, and expand outwards to European influences which many people have never heard of: George Sand, Eugene Sue, etc. etc. A helpful companion book might even beHistory of Philosophy, Volume 7 (Modern Philosophy), which has a thorough discussion of the philosopher Schelling.As one example, reading this volume will enable you to read Turgenev's masterpiece,Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics), with Eyes Wide Open and Clear Understanding!These are some of the best books I have ever read!

First, let me establish a rule about books which attempt to bring new things into science.They must (generally) have footnotes.This problem screams for attention early on in this book, where the author simply asserts that pro-reincarnation passages were removed from the Bible, with Church and Imperial approval.Footnote? Where does this particular factoid come from??! I have a whole library of books about Christianity, pro and anti, and I have NEVER heard this particular claim before. Therefore, the author needs some citations to back him up.A paragraph later, the situation gets absurd, with the author stating that Clement of Alexandra, Origen, and St. Jerome were "Gnostics." This is a statement that obviously needs to be defended and cited, but it is not.There is not one footnote in the entire book, nor any indication that the author submitted his findings to be reviewed by his peers. He claims that he is scientifically curious, and wants to "know," but writes what could, for all intents and purposes, be a novel.Much more worrisome are the 450 reviewers who apparently swallowed this book whole, like those fabricated "Conversations with God" published by Neale Walsch, which assured us all that we could easily determine whether our thoughts were correct, simply by subjecting them to the "feel-good" test. That is to say, you think "I am immortal." Is that true? Well, does it make you feel good? Of course it does! So it must be true!Advanced third-graders should be able to spot gaping holes in tripe like this.

Probably the most astonishing item in this book comes from the author's interview with Babette (Willi Muenzenberg's wife) at the age of 91. She was by no means senile; she was ancient, but in top form. She had long ago abandoned Communism and become a sharp critic of that murderous ideology. But she knew where the corpses were buried. When our author asked her, "But what about Sacco and Vanzetti?", she just gave him a little smile and said, "That was Willi's idea."What?!?! How could that possibly be true?The explanation lies in this book, which will really make you dizzy as you recognize the items of Soviet disinformation one at a time. It finally turns into a case of "wheels within wheels," where the dedicated enemies Hitler and Stalin nevertheless wind up cooperating with one another in a sort of Satanic waltz. For example: Hitler wanted to eliminate a large number of German Communists. No problem, said Stalin, and provided him with a list of German Communists that Stalin wanted dead.If you read this book, you will suddenly come to a very different understanding of historical reality. For example, if you read that Felix Frankfurter and Lincoln Steffens both loudly and publicly deplored the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, you will understand why.This is an extremely valuable book which belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in the history of the twentieth century.

Somerset Maugham, in "The Summing Up," confessed that a lot of his favorite reading was "metaphysics." I am beginning to understand why: a good philosopher is trying as hard as he can to discover and explain the truth, and he has little equipment, aside from logic, imagination, other thinkers, and his own hard thinking.I don't know if this book is going to change anyone's thinking about God, but it is (for me) a mind-stretching update into the world of modern science. I mean, do you know that your body has 75 trillion cells, and each one of them is busily manufacturing 2,000 proteins per second?!The Big Bang apparently began with the entire universe at a size smaller than your thumb, and it certainly grew! How many billions of stars and billions of galaxies came from that tiny beginning? How did that happen?Similarly (?), the union of one tiny sperm cell with one egg cell will finally produce a fully-grown human being, with the aforementioned 75 trillion cells, each making 2,000 proteins a SECOND. How did that happen?A further mystery: proteins do not occur in nature, other than proteins manufactured by living cells. You can drain the seas and not find a single protein, unless that protein was made by some sort of life-form and its cells. BUT cells are made of protein, and require protein. Which came first, the chicken or the egg?Another thought-provoking fact is the simple atom. We all remember the little diagram of the atom-as-solar-system from high school --- and we've all (probably) been told that it's inaccurate. It's stunning to find out just how inaccurate it is! Enlarge the nucleus to (say) four inches, and where are the electrons? They're four miles away. Four. Miles. Away. 99.9999999 percent of an atom is nothing but empty space? Well, not quite. The "empty space" is some sort of force field we don't quite understand. Theoretically, the "force" comes from zillions of hypothetical invisible protons humming around. And when we get to the "matter," the weirdness does not stop. All the atomic particles have wave-like properties. It would only be a tiny step further to think "There is no matter in the universe!" That's wrong, of course, but it is certainly right to say that matter is NOT what we imagined it would be. It still works, hammering nails into plywood and all that, and your house is not going to fall down, but quantum mechanics is just weird. (Not only that, inThe Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions, Dr. Berlinski maintains that the math we use for relativity stuff and the math we use for quantum stuff are incompatible with one another.I recommend this book very highly. You might have to absorb it in small doses (I did).

This big Shakespeare book is very welcome and valuable asa general companion to the plays (the sonnets are not discussedmuch). It is certainly a book intended for the generalreader: it contains nary a footnote and there is nobibliography. There is not even, alas, an index!However, aside from its use as Shakespeare companion andtutor, this book advances a rather odd thesis that WilliamShakespeare singlehandedly invented human beings as we knowthem today. The average reader will very likely pause,go back to re-read that sentence, and then scratch his head."What?"For the sake of perspective, it is a commonplace of socialhistory that the European Renaissance gave birth to ourmodern conceptions of "the individual." For example,A. L. Rowse's "The England of Elizabeth" made this pointfifty years ago: "The increasing nationalself-consciousness expresses itself; but most significantof all is the growth of words expressing self-awarenessand personality, fancy and instinct, acuteness ofobservation, the psychological consequences of the senseof individuality that is at the core of the Renaissanceexperience."Well, Bloom is having none of this. Bloom tells us, rightly,that "the age" or "the times" did nothing at all -- wroteno plays, created no art, played no music. Of course allthis was done by people, not by "the age." But Bloom thenasserts that the entire Renaissance "sense of individuality"was the work of William Shakespeare. This would strike manyas a rather odd thought, a side-effect of the Bardolatrywhich Bloom cheerfully admits.Well, this is a complex issue and we can all decide forourselves, but here are a few reflections.First, Bloom never even hints that this "invention of thehuman" might in fact be a re-invention of the individualfound in ancient Greece and Rome. In this sense, Bloomwants to reconceive the Renaissance as the Naissance --thereby once again showing his enormous blind spot: forsuch an avid reader, Bloom seems to have read andunderstood precious little from pagan antiquity.Second, it would seem to stand to reason that -- if BillShakespeare was the unique inventor of the human -- that wewould find this miraculous event only happening in England;the Renaissance experience in France, Germany, and Italywould be utterly different, and their humanity would remain"stuck" in the Middle Ages, since Shakespeare didn't gettranslated very quickly. But I see no evidence at all ofthis, and Bloom can't be troubled to supply any.So, my own feeling is that Bloom's grandiose claim should bewhittled back to Shakespeare's visible achievement, inrevolutionizing the representation of human beings in hisplays, of building on the masterpieces of antiquity(Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides) and surpassing them incertain key aspects. With this in mind, it is easy toenjoy the rest of the book.

This brilliant book was published in 1995, around the time when the Clinton administration had suffered a big loss in Congress. And after Clinton came George W. Bush, so for thirteen years America was not suffering TOO badly from "the vision of the anointed."But 2008 rolled around, and so did Barack Obama and his administration, and suddenly this book came into its own. The "Vision Of The Anointed" was suddenly in the driver's seat --- in Washington and in the media, and The Anointed had nothing but scorn for the unwashed, knuckle-draggin', Bible-clinging and gun-clinging troglodytes who saw reality more clearly than the anointed did. Suddenly, in the new post-racial environment, everyone was hurling the term "racist" at almost everyone. And, most amazingly, the anointed simply ceased to care about letting the unwashed feel their undiluted scorn. Congressional leaders openly referred to average Americans, peacably assembled in political protests, in shocking terms: "mobs," "evil-doers," "teabaggers" (an obscene reference) were among the most memorable.And when video exposes threatened the huge empire of community organizers known as ACORN (with 200 other names), a number of leftists chose to go to the defense of ACORN --- to go to the defense of people willingly involved in tax fraud, housing fraud, prostitution, underage prostitution, and sexual trafficking of minors!I recommend the review from "Publisher's Weekly" for an example of The Sneer Of The Anointed. In this book, Sowell offers a template for leftist failure. First, there is a "CRISIS" discovered. Then the leftist (Statist) "solution" is proposed. Dismal, knuckle-dragging troglodytes object that this solution will produce Unintended Consequence "Z." They are ignored by The Anointed, and the "solution" is put into effect. Ten years later, there is nothing but "Z" on view. So what? The Anointed simply decide it's time to "move on."Sowell offers three illustrations of this template. The first is LBJ's War On Poverty, which was designed to get people off the welfare rolls. The Anointed admitted that the solution would be expensive, in the early years, but in the end, fewer people would be dependent on the government. The knuckle-dragging troglodytes objected that welfare dependency would increase. The program went through, over their objections, and ten years later the number of Americans receiving welfare had doubled. Nothing but "Z" was on view.The second example is sex education, where the goal was a reduction in teenage pregnancy, VD, etc. Ten years later, the rate of these problems had soared. Nothing but "Z" was on view. More than that, The Anointed were beginning to insist on sex education in every year K-12. What?! The birds and the bees can be explained coherently in less than an hour, but The Anointed had no intent of doing just that. They wanted to change the thinking of an entire generation --- and for that, twelve years of propaganda would do nicely.The third example is the Warren Court and their friends revolution in the treatment of criminals. Focusing on prevention and rehabilitation, ten years later crime rates around the nation had soared. Nothing but "Z" ws on view. Once again, The Anointed simply decided to "Move On," and let someone else clean up their mess.This year, we have new things labelled a "CRISIS." The doubtful thing called "global warming," or "climate change" has suddenly become a crisis, and so has something as everyday as going to the doctor.How this will play out remains to be seen, but every thinking American needs to take a look at this stunningly prescient book.

This book is excellent reading. I found myself nodding my head with almost everything the author had to say, most particularly the idea that "pleasure is not happiness." Gorging yourself on ice cream may be a pleasure, but if you make it a habit you will be quite unhappy because you look like a walrus.I especially enjoyed his chapter on male / female differences. After first noting that human nature is insatiable ("Give me more! more! more!"), Prager makes the intriguing point that men and woman are both insatiable, but in very different ways. The typical male wants to have sex with every good-looking woman he sees -- that's his insatiability. The typical woman wants endless emotional intimacy -- and that's her insatiability.Another important thought is that "Everything has a price," and we had better understand that. To marry, or to remain single? Prager lists the price which must be paid for either choice. Whether to have children? Weigh the costs and the benefits e.g. children are expensive, but raising children may have enormous rewards which cannot be measured in rupees. What is the "price" of a child who comes running to meet you after work, saying "Hello, Daddy" while he gives you a hug?If you're going to read a self-help book this year, choose this one.

I read this book many years ago, in college, and it has stayed in my memory. Recently I decided to re-read it, and discovered that it is just as powerful as always.I'm also reading Joseph Frank's life of Dostoevsky, and I suspect that Frank is right when he pinpoints what makes this such a suspenseful novel: "Crime & Punishment" is like a detective novel, except we obviously are not trying to find out who committed the crime. What we are trying to discover is the same thing Raskolnikov is trying to understand: his motive for the double murder. Many clues and possibilities are left for us to examine: could it be his poverty? His desire to help the unfortunate? His rage at social injustice? There is an unforgettable cast of characters surrounding Raskolnikov, each one offering him another possibility at understanding himself, as he is constantly torn between his strong desire to help people in distress, and his ideological conviction that the "strong man" is above such miserable weakness.Make no mistake about it: this is a disturbing masterpiece, and it is not light-hearted. There is a nightmare scene where a horse is savagely beaten that will stay with you for a long time, and the description of the crime itself was so brutal that it shocked nineteenth-century Russian readers, one of whom wept as he read the book. "Fantastic realism" is one way to describe this book, and the nightmare vision of St. Petersburg which Dostoevsky creates."Ideas have consequences" would be one of the thoughts to take away from this book.

It is not possible to review this massive collection of 14 CDs (in the Amazon-allotted space), but I think it is possible to state that the two greatest pianists of the 20th century were Arthur Rubinstein and Claudio Arrau, and that this collection of CDs is something that you will prize forever.

I've noticed a number of Muslim readers sending in negative reviews because, let's face it, the Bad Guys in this book are Muslim.I have no problem with a novel about the West versus Al-Qaeda, but I did have some other problems with this book. The biggest problem was that the protagonist (Jalal) was simply not believable, and neither was his self-enforced isolation from his employer, the CIA. I also found it Risky Business to show Jalal as a convert to Islam, who still maintained his hostility to Al-Qaeda.But the book became downright silly at the end, when suddenly Jalal's girlfriend jumped into action, and the two of them managed to bring down two massive terror plots within twelve hours, despite being shot and being infected by bio-war bacteria.I mean, really!? You want to stop a dirty bomb, so you just start walking down the street waiting for the man driving it to happen along??

The authors meticulously tie down and skewer a particular type of Latin American Idiot, a "progressive leftist" who thinks that the "free market" is "inhuman," etc. etc.But it's easy to see lots and lots of North American Idiots in this portrait, as well as handfuls of European Idiots. Noam Chomsky and Medea Benjamin fit right in, both wallowing in economic illiteracy.This book can be very profitably read by anyone in the world! The main point the authors come back to over and over again is the silly idea that wealth is "stolen," and not created. That is, if a foreman in Detroit makes 50 times as much as an Indian peasant in the Andes, well, that lousy American stole it from the peasant. Or he "exploited" him.We've all heard this nonsense many times before, mostly from people who are very comfortably off (Chomsky, for example, is a millionaire). But the simple fact is that the foreman in Detroit PRODUCES fifty times as much as that peasant in the Andes. Of course, the foreman is surrounded by competent workers and managers, and huge capital investment in machinery etc. BUT at the end of the day, you have to produce wealth in order to have it.Think about that. The United States is, according to the Idiots, the supreme exploiter in the world today. Yet the booming American economy, some $12 trillion strong, is two-thirds based on services! How can services possibly exploit starving peasants in the Andes?The new democratic government in Mexico is a pretty surprising example of the Idiots finally in retreat. With NAFTA in place, and foreign investment encouraged, the Mexican economy has managed to reach the threshold of a trillion dollars, with a per capita GDP of $10,000. That's doing marginally better than Thailand, and of course infinitely better than Cuba.

When this "new and improved" version of Harold McGee's classic arrived, I immediately put my old, beat-up copy of the first edition in the "to-be-recycled" pile, and picked up the new version with great anticipation.I immediately turned to the index and looked for "Salisbury steaks" and "Kellogg's Corn Flakes" and "American Food Manias," only to discover that my very favorite section of the book had been DELETED!! Not updated and improved, folks --- it was GONE! It didn't take me long to discover that McGee may have deleted that section on "American Food Manias" because he has gone over to the "enemy camp." :-0 He now has a long, long discussion about "free radicals" and "antioxidants" and even includes a chart telling us which foods are good for which part of the body. It's an update, sure, but an update of such nonsense as "fish are brain food" and "garlic cures cancer." This all strikes me as pathetic pseudo-science, but I could be wrong. Let's come back in a hundred years and find out. But I (naturally) suspect that I am right! :-) "Eating right to fight disease" is what leads to all these silly news stories about how a glass of wine can "fight" colon cancer (red wine only!), and peanut butter is good against calcium deficiency, and fish are brain food. (I made all those up.)---------------- LATER ADDITION -----------------------------Two recent medical papers are raising big questions about antioxidants, to wit: they appear to cancel some of the effects of exercise, and may even have a tendency to PROMOTE cancer. And we still have 99.5 years to go! :-)----------------------------------------------------------------Now, it's obvious and well-known that we have to pay attention to getting the right nutrients. Scurvy was not a daydream, and eating citrus fruits cured it. Here in Thailand, the peasants in Isaan often develop goitre, from a lack of iodine, and some places in Northern Thailand evidently supply way too much calcium (or something) because some people develop mottled teeth. But America is not Thailand. Eat a moderate amount of a wide variety of foods, and you'll be doing just fine.I also noted McGee's attempt to deal with the newly discovered phenomenon of "umami" --- the "fifth taste." He gets the story right, but can't resist slamming MSG, and I sense that he simply could not help himself here. You cannot be a politically correct Northern Californian and say something nice about MSG, any more than the ex-hippies could say anything nice about "refined white sugar." The battle over things like meat and MSG has nothing to do with food science or any science, but everything to do with leaving the correct tribal markers.Worse than all that, I simply cannot get INTO the new edition. The old one seemed to invite the reader in, at every new chapter; the new one seems to want to be A Food Authority, with about as much life and pizazz as a row of headstones in a graveyard.Psst! Want a good book? Read M.F.K. Fisher's translation of Brillat-Savarin, or get a copy of the first edition of THIS book before the price hits $[...]!!!

Having been brought up in a liberal culture which automatically assumed (and taught) that the adolescent rebel Rimbaud was a far more important poet than his old fuddy-duddy "conventional" lover, Paul Verlaine, it is very interesting to read Verlaine's actual poetry and compare it with the so-called poetry of Rimbaud, and to realize that Verlaine was, by miles and miles, the greater poet of the two.Of course, time and reflection will also cast doubt on the very idea of Verlaine as "conventional," running off to London with a gorgeous young man as he did. And Rimbaud certainly did not stick around his country of birth to fight for his ideas, his poetry, or anything.Les sanglots longsdes violonsde l'automneblessent mon coeurd'une langueurmonotone.Tout suffocantet blme, quandsonne l'heure.je me souviensdes jours anciens,et je pleure...Et je m'en vaisau vent mauvaisqui m'emportede &agrave;, de l&agrave;,pareil &agrave; lafeuille morte...(That's not Rimbaud!)

For most of my life I have been a Norelco / Braun user, but the latest Braun got to be a real irritation because it would send me off to buy more cleaning fluid once a month. In Thailand, that was $25 a month! And then it cried out for replacement blades, which were another hassle and another $75.I finally got sick of the whole routine, bought a Mach III, and put the Braun in the trash a few weeks later. The Mach III works beautifully -- in the past two years I haven't had a single nick (no blood!) and not even a hint of discomfort. I replace the blades about once a month or so, but that's a $3 item, not $25 -- and that $3 covers the $75 cost of replacing the Braun blades.And the Mach III is more than "something cheap" -- it gives a closer, easier shave than the electric razors.I gave up on razor blades years ago, when they would nick me and cause discomfort. But that was 40 years ago, and the caravan most definitely has moved on!! :-)

Plotinus was an unusual philosopher: Gibbon lambasted him and his fellow neo-Platonists for trying to turn philosophy into religion. Be that as it may, Plotinus is surely one of the very few pagan philosophers who could be called a mystic, and, of that group, he was beyond doubt the most influential. He was imitated and "reincarnated" many times during the centuries to come.He's also legendarily difficult, and that's where this book comes in. If you want to get your feet wet, and get at least a beginner's understanding of Plotinus, this would seem to be the book to get. At the very least, a careful reading of the introduction and the first selection ("On Beauty") will give you an idea of how far you want to go with Plotinus.Notice, though, Balzac's thought on the matter: "Man only lives, in fact, by some personal satisfaction. The passionless, perfectly righteous man is not human; he is a monster, an angel wanting wings." :-)By the way, and ignoring Balzac, Plotinus seems to go rather well with Bruckner.

These magnificent heroes are not Spiderman, or Batman. They are real Americans (SEALs) who will likely astonish you.They astonished me. I'm no fan of shoot-em-up war movies, and no big fan of today's movies in general. Typically, I'll watch a DVD for a while and then press "Eject" and go read a book. But I watched this movie, spellbound, to the end.Why? I wonder. The plot is skimpy, but it WORKS, and it just flies by. It's hard to talk about the acting, when most of it is done by real SEALs firing weapons.Perhaps it just comes down to gratitude, that America still has magnificent men like the SEALs, who keep the country safe by frequently putting their lives on the line.You may or may not know this, but every Peaceable Kingdom needs tough and ruthless border guards. Why? is a question left up to the reader.
