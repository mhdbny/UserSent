It is a rarity these days when a horror movie presents something new. The Descent proves that there are still new boundaries to cross and new horror techniques to keep fans on the edge of their seats. It is not often that a movie can leave me open-mouthed in awe of its sheer brilliance. Emotional, thrilling, riveting, and downright brutal at times, The Descent has it all. This one is sure to impress any fan of the genre, especially those who don't fall for the typical Hollywood schlock. Instant entry into my top ten list of Best Horror Movies Ever! Highly Highly Recommended!

By far the finest product I have ever used to repair latex and vinyl. Most glues will not bond to these substances, Shoe Goo worked PERFECTLY the first time. Works on hard-to-repair halloween masks as well. If you want a product that is SIMPLE to use and will work right THE FIRST TIME right out of the package...BUY SHOE GOO! You will not be disappointed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Yet another 4 star film that lost a star in the last minutes of the film. This one lost it in the last 15 seconds. Overall, still quality horror in the vein of Exorcist, The Omen, etc. Effects ranged from blah to excellent. I guess they spent the extra cash on the lightning, and couldn't afford a real-looking dead bull...oh well. This is still worth a watch. A rent, nothing more.

Okay, I am the first to admit that I enjoyed this DVD. It is, however, just a rehash of his TV show with a lot of things stolen from comedians like George Carlin and Chris Rock. Many people are down on Carlos because he uses a stage name...so what? If your name was Ned Holness, you would have changed it too. Also, a lot of people say that all he did was rip off Dave Chapelle and replace him when he left Comedy Central. Well, most of these people are "fanboys" of Chapelle who can't get over the fact that their favorite comic lost his marbles. Overall, a funny DVD, but not very original.

This film is much better than most of the reviews claim. I do not know when it became "cool" to hate Stephen King's work, but that is the sense that I get from the negative reviews. This film is a nice spin on the "alien invasion" theme. Pay attention and don't get too lost in the "visual metaphors" that run through the film. Any true fan of sci-fi will enjoy this film. Recommended!

One of the few (especially in the horror genre) that does not let down as a sequel. Providing insight into the original while continuing the tale in a new, terrifying style. Once again, the story does not go where the viewer thinks it's going. A great suspense worthy of the SAW name. Highly reccomend this feature to any horror fan!!!

First, highschool does NOT define who you are for life!Okay, with that said, this movie defines a CLASSIC football film. One of the best. Why Amazon is "packaging" this with crap like "Ray" I'll never know.This movie excels with performances by all involved and a story that even non-football fans will find riveting. The unnecessary "relationship" scenes at the beginning of the film have nothing ot do with the rest of the movie, but that is the only failure of this film...must needed to have appealed to younger audiences.Adults and true football fans will see the tragedy and beauty that is Friday Night Lights. A film that will go down as a classic in this genre.

First, this movie gets one star ONLY because I can't seem to rate it zero stars. Second, let's correct all the self-righteous fools in some of the other reviews...Quinn and Vigil created the Faust comic series LONG before Todd McSellout created Spawn. That being said, the character's appearance is clearly a rip-off of Marvel's Wolverine (created in the 70s). Now for the film...well, there is nothing to really say...it sucks. It very well could be the worst film ever made. Nope, no exaggeration, it could be THE WORST. It is a TRUE SHAME that this schlock will be forever paired with what was one of the best, most brutal comic book series' ever produced (however, it too even went through a couple different distributors before the series was completed YEARS behind schedule). Oh, sorry, back to the film...it SUCKS. Don't waste your money...PLEASE...don't waste your time.

Why did this movie get rave reviews? It was too long, too boring, and DID NOT rewrite the "zombie genre" which so many people claimed it did. I found the the plot jumpy and inconsistent. There was no real "feel" of terror. All that being said, I think the main thing that failed this movie was the outside over-hype. It was nothing that I expected, because if it had been, then it would have been good. Sorry, can't recommend this one.

Misses the mark. A great idea bogged down by a bad film. This had so much potential, but the execution was just sad and borderline pathetic. If it hadn't been for the the enjoyable death of the attorney, I'd have given this just one star. The "ghosts" were fun to watch, as well as well thought out. Too bad they were not better developed as true "characters" in the film. The "real" characters were shallow and uninteresting. The only one we cared about (the psychic) was underutilized. Overall, a waste of time.

This is a very well written, informative and thoughtful book. While not very long, it contains bits of wisdom that will actually make the reader contemplate what they are reading. I read this while sitting in the library, but would not hesitate to buy it from one of the "lower price" sellers. A good blend of Christianity and Buddhism. Recommended!

While I would not bill this movie as a comedy in the purist sense, it will keep you laughing. Brilliant performances by the entire cast. I personally would have liked to see a little more true "retribution"...you'll know what I mean if you see this film, but I'll take it as it is. (That is the only reason it got only 4 instead of 5 stars)How often does a film like this come along? Not too often! Let's take a look at something that makes this movie really special. It is a drama/comedy, a damned funny comedy, that actually supports and puts forth Christian values! Now, I have to admit, when I rented this I never saw that one coming! What a rare treat.HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS FILM!!!

The only thing worse than reading a book that is 300 pages that should have been 200 pages is watching a movie that is 100 minutes long, that felt like 3 hours long, that should have been 60 minutes long. Wait, there is something worse...trying to watch a HORROR movie an having to sit through two lame pseudo-sex scenes before anything HORROR related even starts to happen. Shutter is based on a good premise gone wrong by trying to translate it for an American audience. I am no fan of all these Asian-remake horror flicks. It was done right ONCE with The Ring...let it go. Another problem...how could an actress who was good in Transformers have totally forgotten how to ACT??? I won't even mention the rest of the cast, becasue they were clueless. The only saving grace of this movie was the ending, not just becasue it was over, but becasue it was actually good. That is the ONLY reason it gets two stars. Too bad you have to sit through the rest of this garbage to get to the ending. WASTE OF TIME!!!

Backpacker was the PREMIERE outdoor adventure magazine until it changed hands from Rondale press. Now it is a shell of its former self. Still better than the fashion-puke rags that claim to be adventure mags like Outside and anything with "Mens" in the title. A few less ads would make the magazine better, but for those who complain about the political edge, Backpacker has a long tradition of EXCELLENT outdoors-related political commentary. Backpacker reviews have always been spot on and I have never been dissatisfied by any of their recommendations. Worth a cheap subscription price.

OKay, let's get to it. The movie is worth watching for only a couple reasons. A few really good corpse scenes and the Man-Thing creature. Now, the really good corpse scenes are scattered throughout the movie, but one has to wait to the end to see the entire Man-Thing. [...]Watch it with the sound off, scan for the good corpse scenes and watch the last 3 minutes. Otherwise, this pathetic script, poor acting, and forced scenes will drive you mad. He, haven't we seen this plot before...like 100 times...corporate pollution + creature (environmentalist) + Alaska, swamp, desert, rainforest location = crap. They could have done so much more with this!

This film did not need to be made. I guess that is my main problem with it. I wanted to enjoy it, because I loved the classic, but this is a far cry from that. The original was a dark comedy...this film just made everything too right at the end.The beginning was also way too drawn out. Come on, we all know that Charlie eventually gets a golden ticket...let's get on with the story already.Depp had me laughing at a couple parts and the obsessive sports-mom had a few good lines, but otherwise I was unimpressed. How about originality out of Hollywood? Wow, does every film need to be remade? Can't you people think of anything new?

Now, I would draw short of calling this movie bad. It might be silly and stupid, but not really bad. The story was okay, but the execution was lacking. Now, I will call the editing BAD. It seems like half-way through the movie there is a need to "cut and paste" some scenes just to get to a drawn out ending. I am also not real sure the casting director did much work picking the "kids" for this film. Hollywood must be short on talented child actors. Two stars only because I actually laughed a couple times...other than that it would have gotten the solo star review. Feel free to pass on this one.

Finish is the only cleaner recommended by the manufacturer of our dish washer. That made choosing this version of Finish a piece of cake. The orange scent and cleaning power makes Finish even better than ever. This is a simple choice. If you want your dishes to be cleaner than ever before, and you want that citrus splash, add this product to your list! You will not be sorry!

Overall a nice twist on the tale of Jack the Ripper. The film went in depth with what could have been the motive behind the 1888 slayings in Whitechapel. We will never know the true story, but From Hell delivers an explanation the plays well as both an enjoyable film and a stab at one of history's most notorious figures. Brutal, sad, and thought provoking. A definite recommendation!

So much of what we see on the classic TZ episodes has been redone to death these days. These are some of the ORIGINAL stories from a classic age of sci-fi suspense. This volumes includes three of the classic, iconic episodes. Kind of a hodge-podge mix of good stories on this disc. Probably the weakest in the collection, but still worth watching. Recommended.

Great story, great animation, great presentation. Monster House is the type of animation that draws you in so much that it does not feel like an animated film. I am surprised they didn't attempt to make this a live action movie. Style very reminiscent of The Goonies. I love the reviews who complain the movie is "too much for those under 13"...funny, the MPAA has a rating system...it is rated PG. On the same note, the movie has some deep and creepy undertones. Again, no more so than some of the great "young adult" movies that exist. This movie is a definite recommendation. Not as fast paced as most of the animated fare out there...that's because this one actually makes you think and care about the characters. Four solid stars!

I caught this film on the Hallmark Channel over Thanksgiving weekend. Along with its sequel (Meet The Santas, not out on DVD) it is a GREAT holiday movie. I have to admit, I went in with no expectations, but was pleasantly surprised with the "new" twist on holiday traditions. More than a belief vs. non-belief movie, this film breaks the molds and sets a new standard for holiday film magic. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Probably the best psychological thriller in YEARS. This is not an easy film to get in to, and it takes a lot of commitment to stay with it to the end. The payoff is worth the wait. I tend to call this type of film a "sleepy-thriller". It moves along at its own pace, not overly concerned about the viewer's "timeframe". Quite possibly the best Bale movie I have ever seen. His dedication to the role and his portrayal of Reznick is mesmerizing. So much better than the typical Hollywood schlock. Recommended!

This book is a definite page-turner and can easily be finished in one sitting. That being said, it is a fine reflection of emotional conflict that comes with being in a war. More than that, it is a book about loyalty and friendship that I think any young boy can benefit from reading. A classic.

I then tried the full version of the game in an attempt to try to find out if it had any hidden glory. I wasted my time. This game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about. Enemies are too easy to kill and the "light up" weak spots are childish and lame. With so much potiential, this game was a huge disappointment.

Amazing show, but PAINFULLY slow. It took about two episodes to get me hooked, but once it did, Carnivale delivered. The characters and their actions keep the viewer interested even when the "main story" isn't moving along. No matter how slow, each episode seems to have a "pay-off" style ending with a surprise or twist in store for the dedicated viewer. I wish I could give this series more than three stars, but, to be honest, this series is only going to truly intrigue a hardcore fan of the genre.

This is one of Seagal's better films (funny how it still rates only 3 stars). Not quite as hardcore as some of his early fare, and not as preachy as his later films. A good mid-ground piece by a less-than-stellar actor. Still all the action and martial arts makes up for the lack of substantial plot. Clearly worth a watch.

Lansing's telling of the circumstances of the Endurance and E.H. Shacklton's Antarctic expedition is simply powerful. Only a few words do justice to this incredible tale, "wow" being one of them. The reader truly "feels" the constant pain, suffering, and utter despair that plagued the crew throughout their stranding in the Antarctic ice floe. The cold is palpable, the wind echoes in your head, the hunger twitches in your gut, and the contact fear heightens the senses. Throughout the story the reader cannot help but feel for the crew, who are thwarted over and over again at every turn. Each time you think things are getting better, they only get worse. This carries through to the very end. The reader is caught in the despair of the crew who, by their own strength never give up hope. These men shine through as the true definition of survivors. In times where we tale so many conveniences for granted, these men dealt with circumstances that would crumble lesser souls. This is an absolute MUST READ! No adventure traveler or explorer should venture out without having first read Lansing's book or at least packing it along to remind themselves how bad things can really get and what it truly means to have the will to live. HIGHLEY RECOMMENED!

GUN is by far the best western genre game since Oregon Trail. Now, let us not truly compare the two, since they are from different eras. The fact is, GUN is an excellent standard by which to compare future western games. The problem is, there are not that many in the genre. The horseback riding, the mechanics, and the entire scope of the game make the player truly feel like they are in the 1800s. Bottom line, at such a bargain price, buy GUN, you will not be disappointed.

Okay, I am going to go against the grain of other reviewers here and (without spoilers) give you the true scoop on Season 2. As we all recall, Season 1 was more than riveting, it was groundbreaking storytelling at its finest. Season 2 starts off this way and then takes a sharp decline. It is almost as if the first three episodes and the last three episodes of Season 2 were written by someone else. The middle episodes (while still better than most other schlock on television) seemed to drag on forever. I cannot help it, I find Walt's wife to be the least likable, least interesting, and the character I would most love to see killed off in the entire series (with Hank a close second, but he gets better developed in Season 3). Season 2 spends a lot of time focusing on Skyler, her pregnancy and Walt's medical condition. Yeah, I am aware that these are central to the series, but enough already, we get it, can we move on to the more interesting aspects of this series? Maybe it was just me, but I found the finale to be less than climactic and could see it coming from the second to last episode. Maybe I am just jaded by how great Season 1 was and Season 3 is (which I am watching now - hint: Much more like Season 1 - AMAZING). Again, I am not bashing this show, I find the entire series to be superior to most all others I have watched, however once you set such a high standard, it is imperative to live up to it with each episode and not throw fillers in mid-season just to drag the story out longer. Tell your story clearly and concisely. No, this is not a short-attention span thing, it is a classic storytelling rule that should be adhered to. Admittedly, I watched the entire season in about 3 days, so maybe I was just overwhelmed by everything that was going on, but you would think that (given that short span of time) I would not have felt that the show was moving along too slow. Now, the haters can hate and bash this review, but if you are a true fan of this series, you must admit that I am right on at least a few points. And for those comparing this series to THE SHIELD...come on!!! THE SHIELD jumped the shark the minute they killed Lem. The rest of that show was a jumbled mess. THE SHIELD does not even deserve to stand in Breaking Bad's shadow. Final thought: Breaking Bad is still one of the finest series ever. Period, full stop, end of discussion.

I picked this game up in the $10 bin at a local store. I have since sold it on Ebay. Having said that, it is worth that price and nothing more. I enjoyed the hunts and strategy of the game. The graphics, however, were horrible, and it is almost impossible to tell what you are shooting at. Tracking is just about useless, and you are penalized if you shoot a species or gender that you do not have tags for. Overall this game could have been so much better. I expect more out of future Cabela installments.

Why is it that everything from Disney gets over-the-top attention and a movie like this is forgotten? This is by far the finest work of animation/storyline that has ever come out of Warner Bros. If you call this a cartoon, you deserve to be kicked in the head! This is a wonderful tale that transcends the genre!The sound and animation truly make you feel this movie! It is enough to take your breath away. With so much crap being pushed at kids today it is about time they saw some REAL quality work! But don't think this is just a kids movie. The deep story in the film will keep adults cheering all the way through! I cannot reccomend this film highly enough! I just want to kick my own butt for not seeing it on the big screen seven years ago!Get you popcorn, find a friend with a 65' TV and surround sound then BUY THIS MOVIE!!!

The Maxpedition Drop Pouch is truly combat ready. It folds out much bigger than you would expect. It is perfect for all those loose items you may need to quickly store while in any multitude of situations. The nice benefit is, if you no longer need the storage, it rolls up into a compact, low-profile bundle that you will not even notice on your belt or LBE. A great addition to any gear set. The uses of this item are endless. As others have stated, the non-shooter can use it for metal detecting, artifact hunting, or even just carrying dog treats for your furry friend while out on a walk. No matter your particular situation, you will not be disappointed with this item.

A true masterpiece of the classic science fiction genre. Packed full of interwoven stories that depict a world that is all too familiar. It has the same social impact today as it did when these stories were written. The fact that human nature does not change. Bradbury captures that perfectly in these stories. These are not tales for anyone looking for uplifting, life affirming prose. These tales border on the macbre and deliver it in a way that is often humorous. This book is simply a MUST READ for anyone who loves science fiction. This is not a high-speed, action adventure, sceince fiction read. It will appeal to those who are respectful of the genre and not those looking for a fast high.

I went into this film, like many of the other reviewers, thinking this was going to be a horror film. That was a mistake. Much more along the lines of Ghost In The Darkness, this film is about the convergence of primitive superstitions and real wildlife danger. The film does not stop there. It is also a social commentary on the forgotten areas of Africa and the plight of the native population. With all that mixed together, Primeval is an engaging, dramatic, and thrilling film...but still nothing like it was billed. With all the serious overtones, the film could have done without the "comedic" lines written for Orlando Jones. Sometimes it felt like "Chris Tucker Goes On Safari". Overall, solid performances by the rest of the cast (including Jones in his non-comedic moments). I found that while it was not what I expected, I still walked away enjoying this film. The effects were so-so, but once you realize that this movie is not "really about" the giant croc, the effects seem not to matter. The film delivers enough entertainment to rate four stars (maybe a shaky four stars, but four stars all the same).

This is by far one of the most unique and brilliant shows to come along in a very long time. The cast is amazing. What would seem like a simple concept is developed in an elaborate and creative way. The story draws the viewer in to the point that you CANNOT turn away. The characters are dynamic and engaging in every aspect. This is a series that could go the distance as one of the finest EVER.

We have seen everything in this film before. It is the same as every other "what-to-do-when-you-know-you're-going-to-die" movie. Nicholson seems to be trying to recreate his "As Good As It Gets" character. All these things aside, this really is a good movie at it's core. It is still well done and worth watching. Anyone who has lost someone to the scourge of cancer will be touched. Don't expect anything drastically new, but do expect a quality film.

This is a great examination of the facts behind the Bigfoot legend. Keep in mind that this book was written in 1972, but much of the basic information is timeless. The book lacks in the more recent facts in the quest for a North American primate. The book could have also used a little tighter editing, Napier repeats himself several times and the book is full of misspellings. Napier also seems to focus on the lack of evidence for the yeti rather than focus on the North American sasquatch. More recent evidence for (and against) the existence of the yeti is worth examining after reading this tome. DO NOT let these little issues dissuade you from buying this book. It is still a GREAT read. Overall, I feel fortunate to have found this fair and accurate examination of the evidence to date (1972). The conclusions are fair, but the reader can draw and reach their own conclusions. Highly Recommended!

This is by far the best performance of Mrs. Moore's entire career. A semi-dark, mystery that will keep you guessing. No Hollywood ending here! Mrs. Moore makes you feel the character she portrays. It is definately not what you think! Congrats to Demi for scoring big with this film.It doesn't keep me from wanting to stand on Ashton Kutcher's throat, but this film shows that Mrs. Moore can still make some good decisions. I truly hope she has many more performances like this one in her future. This could be a whole new start to her career!

Let's take a look at this film in all its wonderful elements. The premise - unique perspective on the horror genre. With such a great idea, why was so much time (actually any time) wasted on the schlock pseudo-sex scenes? What a waste. That was time that could have been used to develop the plot. This film felt like a twist on the old Stephen King Creep Show piece. The main difference is that King knows how to deliver suspense without wasting time on unimportant minutia. The characters - sort of pretty well developed. Granted, not enough to actually care about any of them, but they were better developed than some horror films. The antagonist (the evil weeds) - wow, I would have liked to see this entire theme better explained. Maybe if the film-makers had cut the entire first 20+ minutes of this feature and spent that time on the actual ruins, well, then we might have had a 3 star film. I give this waste-of-time 2 stars only for the big "DAMN!" scene...and you'll know which one that is when you see it. Other than that, don't waste your time with this nonsense. A truly disappointed horror fan.

This film is jumbled mix of Mutual of Omaha Presents and an old Disney "we're-going-to-kill-the-dog-at-the-end" type film. Narrated in a melodramatic, homey tone reminiscent of the old Tex Avery cartoons. I forgot how much fun it was to watch people run in the 70s...no one could ever run without falling down. A whole lot a nature filming and no scientific "creature" basis for this pseudo-documentary. I would strongly warn against buying it. Poor quality filming, bad editing, redundant scenery, and bad acting...probably only bearable for one screening. That being the case, you can find this entire film for free on the internet. The film does, however, contain my new all time favorite line from any movie. When speaking about an old hermit in the "bottoms" the narrator describes him as, "He walks with a limp. He once shot off half his foot in a boating accident"...shot off half his foot in a BOATING accident...PRICELESS. One of the characters in the film goes on to describe the area she just moved into, "What type of place is this? Panthers living under a house?"...meanwhile in the same scene, the sheriff just gives these folks one of his shotguns and basically tells them, "Good luck"...yeah, what type of town is this? Anyway, for the HARDCORE cryptid fan, Boggy Creek is worth watching once. Other than that, it is just an old novelty film, nothing more.

This film helps to make the story of Jigsaw even more complex. A great addition to the franchise. Nothing is ever simple in the Saw series and this installment is no exception. Horror fans should be pleased. These films seem to be very "fluid" in continuity, film style and feel. Many other filmmakers could learn from that alone. Highly recommended.

This movie is pure fun from beginning to end. A sci-fi flick with a western theme. A great film that has been copied time and again with less than stellar results. See the original, the borderline-masterpiece that started a whole new genre. Recommended!

This is a great movie, especially for those who enjoyed Van Helsing and Constantine. The effects were complete and amazing throughout the entire production. SO many movies in this genre fall short by having good effects for big scenes and then crappy effects for minor scenes. This is not the case with Underworld. The other good thing about this film is that it is not bogged down by crap that doesn't have anything to do with the major plot. There is a deep sense of emotion in the film, but no crappy love scenes with vampire or werewolves. I applaud the film makers for keeping this film above-board. It will go down as one of my favorite films of all time.

I have to admit that I liked the epcot-esque city in which this story is based. Its retro sci-fi look is great and lends itself well to the story. The special effects range from "good for the time" to just plain "bad". The story itself drags on a little too long. There is no reason this movie should be 120 minutes. The premise, however, is good and has not been well duplicated since the original. I simply wish sci-fi movies could have avoided "coming of age" during the time of psychedelic filmography. Hard core classic sci-fi fans might be intrigued, but I fear most everyone else will be bored with this film. I can say it's average, and that's about all.

Would you go hiking without a map? Would you work on your car without a manual? Then why would you even think about going to the Middle East without this book? Poole once again sets the standard in the industry for explaining the tactics, history, and mindset of the Islamic Extremist. From military commander to field grunt to civilian contractor, if you're headed to a desert combat zone do yourself a favor and BUY this book! I also suggest you read this book with a highlighter in hand...but you may just end up highlighting everything. This book undoubtedly has saved lives and will save more in the future!

While not as enjoyable as Krakauer's other works, UTBOH is a compelling read. Insightful, giving the outsider a view of the FLDS church that is seldom seen and even less understood. Some of the passages are disturbing and violent. The book sometimes has a feel of anti-religious propaganda, but give credit to Krakauer for being someone who attempts to deliver the facts as best he can. I am sure this was a very difficult book to research due to the "closed" nature of the society he was investigating. Great read for those interested in the topic. The casual reader, however, will be lost in the confusing morass that is the FLDS church.

This is by far one of the most unique and brilliant shows to come along in a very long time. The cast is amazing. What would seem like a simple concept is developed in an elaborate and creative way. Just because they have escaped, don't let that fool you. The story draws the viewer in to the point that you CANNOT turn away. The characters are dynamic and engaging in every aspect. This is a series that could go the distance as one of the finest EVER. This is non-stop action and excitement from beginning to end!

I need to start by admitting that before reading this book I knew nothing about Peretti as an author. I picked up the book because I was interested in the subject matter. That being said:This book started off with an excellent premise and a downright creepy style that quickly turned into a B-Movie...at best. I do not understand why this is billed as a horror novel. A horror novel should rate a "mental R rating" with the reader. This book was PG at best. I laughed over the inside flap reviews that claimed the book would, "make it hard to sleep" or some such drivel. This book is the simple equivalent of a popcorn-munching Saturday matinee feature.I have to admit, I almost stopped reading the book twice. Once when I (mistakenly) thought the author was going to cop-out on his sasquatches and the other time, just due to the sheer boredom of reading the SAME THING over and over again. I felt as mentally abused and physically tired as the books character Beck. Alright already, we get it, they (the family) are fleeing from something, for goodness sake, this information is neither entertaining nor pertinent to the story anymore! You've told us IN DETAIL a dozen times! And, by the way, the MYSTERY of the sasquatches doesn't need to be dumbed-down by explaining every minutia of their actions. Leave something up to the imagination of the reader!This book is WAY TOO LONG, very weak on character development, and overly descriptive of unimportant details. Just using more words does not make your argument or story any better. Less is more! The cliche characters with their uber-cool jobs were mishandled. The other characters all blended together, so much so that, by the end, I didn't care who died, because I couldn't remember who they were or what they did anyway.Doggedly, I read to the very end, and it ended better than expected. I might pick up another Peretti book in the future. I hear many claim he is a Christian writer, but I didn't really see that shine through in this book. This book went from a five star, to a two star, back to a four star, and finally settled on a solid three stars. Genre/subject matter fans will be disappointed, horror fans are going to feel downright angry, and B-Movie fans will write it off as another piece of mediocre fiction.

Okay, for all those who are fans of the Orwell classic, you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen. We're dealing with talking animals relating to humans. This tale is too deep for the "movie public" and ANY movie will fall short for true purists.Taking it for what it is, it is an accurate depiction of the novel. The reviewer who didn't see Moses the Raven in the story must have watched a different film.It is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what Animal Farm represented when originally written. Take that and put it under the Hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who haven't read the novel.I truly enjoyed this film. I reccomend it for all. Even if it is a little difficult to follow. Unlike the box says, it is NOT for children.

Great science fiction continues to stay relevant regardless of the era. That is true about Andre Norton's Zero Stone. Regardless of the fact that the book is almost 40 years old, the story still carries though time. The depth of characters is staggering. The reader could probably use a little less information about the constant need to eat, but this is a sign of the times in which the novel was originally written: it does not detract from the overall story. Not as fast paced as some of the modern fare, but Norton's tale is true literature, while much of what is seen today is simply brain-candy. Highly reccomended to anyone who appreciates the classic sci-fi genre. It should be noted that this tale is part of a two-book series. Zero Stone leaves the reader craving the next installment.

I went into this movie with less than zero expectations. I admit, I typically run screaming from movies of this genre. They are usually stupid to the point of missing comedy entirety (ex: any of the American PIe schlock). Superbad, however, turned out to be surprisingly funny. This film redeemed the "teenage comedy" genre. With a message that reaches beyond the enormity of its sophomoric humor, Superbad will leave the viewer with a good feeling of entertainment. I wish this movie had been marketed differently and perhaps it would have reached an even wider audience. Let us not downplay the rampant profanity and sexual innuendo that pervades this film. But come on, it's about three, not-so-cool, high school seniors. And oh yeah, it's called FICTION for a reason. Watch it for what it is and ENJOY!

Let's keep in mind that this movie has a ridiculous premise, with an equally ridiculous solution. Now, that being said, the movie is watchable in the same light as Armageddon, Volcano, Day After Tomorrow, or any of the other "End of the World" schlock that exists. These movies are the 2000s equivalent of the "post-apocalyptic" genre of the 80s.What can mankind do to save the ENTIRE world? Well, a handful of the world's best scientists ought to do the trick. I was on-board for the ride once this movie got rolling. I bought into space shuttle landing, I even bought the excessively-long "pigeon genocide", but I had to draw the line at "The-single-female-space-pilot-ties-a-windsor-knot" scene. It took me a while to recover from that.All these things being said, I enjoyed the movie. Truly it is only a time-killer and not to be taken for ANYTHING more than that. It is not a social statement. It is not a "humans-are-bad" statement. It is JUST A MOVIE. There are plenty of worse movies that actually get awards each year.It is kind of interesting that the Earth that the heros are trying to save plays the only antagonist in the movie...but let's not start "social dialogue" at this point....

It is truly disappointing when a movie with such unlimited possibility is trashed by inept acting, poor effects, and a director who cannot seem to decide where the movie is going. With such a cool premise, the movie just turns into a bunch of garbage that is unbearable to watch let alone get involved in. I was glad this was a free rental at the local video store. I would have been ticked off had I spent a dime on this crap. Consider yourself warned.

This book is well worth a read by anyone interested in the carny lifestyle. Please be advised, however, that this is more of a biography than a true, in-depth look at the sideshow phenomena. I was disappointed in the lack of analysis and found the title a bit misleading. However, this is still a GREAT READ. It reads like a fast short story, which I guess is what it really is. In other words, yes, it can EASILY be read in one, couple hour, sitting. I would have like more detailed information on the gaffs and "attractions". The honest, easy tone more than made up what this book lacked in substance. Like a few other reviewers, I felt let down by all the stories the author claimed to have but never got around to telling. Tragic, truthful, and sincere, this book is worth a look. Recommended.

I often wonder why Hiatt isn't heralded as one of the best musicians ever. It seems like he has a solid, respectable fan base, but still not mainstream acknowledgement. Now, I'm sure Hiatt doesn't care about being mainstream (his music proves it), but I wish he was given more credit and acknowledgement for his work. Stolen Moments is one of his finest offerings. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

Though I like to blame MTV for the degredation of society, this film put out by the media moguls is a hit. Much better than ever anticipated. Why can't the American Pie series put out true comedy like this? Instead they crap out total steriotypes why this movie, which is genuinely good, gets left in the dust. The performances were good enough for the script. Rent it, you will be pleasantly surprised!

I truly wanted to enjoy this action flick, but find myself just wanting the predictable story to come to an end. I did not like any of the characters and did not care what happened to them. What can they expect when they did not even take the time to develop any of them? It turns out the the most likable was the barkeep. He was the only one even remotely interesting. The story failed on every level as it presented a predictable plot with zero twists. If you did not see the 'reveal' coming from the very beginning, then you must be a complete idiot. I give this jumbled mess three stars though for a few reasons. Some of the visuals were pretty cool, though the aliens themself were humdrum typical (except for their tiny hands). Secondly, the lack of a true Hollywood happy ending made me smile.The fact is, Schlockywood needs to understand that not all comics, or graphic novels, translate to the big screen. I really expected better from the crew behind this film. Maybe I'm still too jaded from Spielberg and Ford ruining Indy with their last film flop. Wait, that one was about amazingly similar, uninspired aliens too.I just have to say again, I really wanted to like this movie. Sad.

There is no doubt that Matt and Jeff are (by far) some of the most talented and exciting pro wrestlers to watch. While they served their fans better as a tag team than solo performers, that fact does not detract from their talent and undeniable athleticism. This DVD is a must for any fan.

I don't think I can cover anything that hasn't already been covered in other reviews. Is this the worst Indy film? Yeah, probably. However, it still fits okay into the franchise. Four Stars For Nostalgias Sake. This series really should have taken the "James Bond Route" and began casting new leads to lend viability to the franchise. At this point it's too late. Still, it was fun while it lasted and took me back to the truly great films of the 80s.

This was one of my favorite films as a kid and the soundtrack is amazing. The surprising thing about this film is how engaging all the supplemental characters come to be. They are not the paper-cut "extras" that permeate so many other films of this genre. FLASH is legendary! Enjoy!

An alien invasion...who doesn't like an alien invasion? How do you screw up such a time honored tradition? If you watch this piece of garbage you know exactly how someone screws it up. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen...and I've seen a lot of bad movies. The acting was horrible, the actors were brainless, the dialogue was mind-numbing, the "cool-lifestyle" was something a 13 yr old would dream up, the effects were rotten, and basically the entire thing failed on every possible level. Okay, it started out with potential, but within minutes you were praying everyone would die and the movie would just end...but it didn't. I drug on from pointless scene to pointless scene. Event he aliens were lame. How do you screw up aliens? WHoever made this movie needs to absolutely give up and find some other job to suck at. Please, I beg you, do not waste your time on this! If you ignore all the warnings, and you actually rent (or God forbid buy this movie), follow the timeline and turn it off before the final 5 minutes (that would be right the time they put "Day Three" on the screen). This advice might just save your sci-fi soul!

I am trying to figure out why this film is almost universally panned. I can only assume that the reviews are from those who have no familiarity with the comic series or those who do not get any enjoyment out of classic pulp comic books. The only problem with Green Lantern is that it probably stuck too close to the comic series and did not drift off into some "Hollywood-esque" superhero movie. The fact is, Green Lantern is a "cosmic" superhero, and to attempt to portray a movie without incorporating that element would serve a huge disservice to the character. If the film-makers had tried to keep Green lantern "down to Earth," it would have gone against the entire grain of the traditional series. The fact is, it is just too bad that this superhero movie was just too comic-like for too many people. I guess they should have darkened it up like Nolan's Dark Knight series, and then all the wannabee fans could rave about how "cool" it was (note: I am not bashing Nolan's 1st or 2nd Batman film [the 3rd was not that good], just he idea that all superhero movies have to be "dark" or "gritty" these days to play to the vast movie going audience). All in all, Green Lantern was a fun film. The only real drawback was the colossal build-up to a "villain" that was so easily defeated. Maybe they can do a better job with that in the next installment. Having said that, I think the film deserves at least one more in the series, most obviously following up with Sinestro. Now, that would be a better overall fight. If you are a classic comic fan, feel free to enjoy this movie and not get taken in by the "hater crowd." I give it 5 stars to attempt to rebalance the rating and get this film where it should be. Recommended!

...But this compilation passes the Buffett Fan Test. It is a good mix of new and old. I am waiting for the singer-songwriter to fully come back to some of his best works. Some of Buffett's lesser known albums are far better than this and I hope he soon returns to that style. It seems like a journey that started with Barometer Soup and just hasn't come back home yet. Still, for the true fan, it does deliver. Not my favortire, but a worthy addition to a complete collection.

(Spoiler Warning) Not exactly sure why this is such a highly regarded movie. It has to be the absolutely weakest in the Nolan franchise. Like it or not, Bane is one dimensional. Having read the original debut of Bane in the comics when he first appeared, I have to say not much has changed with Nolan's interpretation. At least back then he had a little depth, but was never supposed to be a brain surgeon. I do not understand why one would give someone who is supposed to be a drug-raged brute such a calm and distinguished voice. In actuality, the voice was the only thing I liked bout the character at all. Further, Bane is made out to be some evil genius who seems to have absolute control over everyone around him, yet he is "fatally" taken out with one shot from the Bat-Pod...Really? That is how you defeat the villain who just spent the entire movie breaking Batman? Bane = plain boring, 'nuff said. Next there is Catwoman. She added nothing to this movie, should never have been in this movie, and is the least interesting of Batman's rogues gallery. Oh, but that's right, we have to put a pretty girl in a tight outfit into the film for the 13 year old male fans. Oh joy, Nolan finally introduced us to his interpretation of Robin! Anyone who didn't see that coming from Blake's first appearance is just an idiot. I can't stand Robin and despise the very concept of Robin, however, it would have been cool to see him in a pseudo-Nightwing role. Lastly, Alfred and Fox were way under-utilized. Genius actors set by the wayside. Sad. Oh, did I forget to mention Batman? That is probably good since he was hardly in this film at all. That is actually a plus, because Bale plays a much better Bruce Wayne than a Batman. He is far more intriguing as Wayne and perhaps this is the only thing this film gets right. It focuses on Bruce Wayne, and tries to move past "Batman." It is because of that modicum of depth that the film earns two stars instead of none. Overall, it reminded me of Batman Returns...and that is NOT good.

This is by far the best console that is currently available for gamers. There is no denying the failure rate of these consoles, but MS has extended the warranty again to provide for a higher level of customer service. It is a fair price for a console also. The stable of games is of the highest quality and there is simply no true competition at this point. Granted, I have been through two of these consoles myself, but even that does not detract from my love of what this console 'will' be when some of the hardware issues are completely fixed. A gamers console in every aspect with an online component that is TESTED and PROVED to stand far above anything else that is out there. You can't go wrong here.

Too many reviewers are taking themselves too seriously and then getting mad about this film. Unlike most of the reviewers, this film does not take itself too seriously. Hey, it's PG-13!!! It's perfect for FAMILY FUN entertainment. If you are looking for some scary, bloody, vulgar, horror-laden, "witch movie" look elsewhere. This film is fun in the same style that Indiana Jones can be fun (and way better than the last Indy film, BTW). Sure the dialogue is choked-full of one liners (some funny, others not so much) but this film isn't striving to be an epic tale of witch trials, the inquisition and the crusades! Come on people, it's only 95 minutes long...what do you expect? I can recommend this for a fun, popcorn-munching evening. High cinema it is not. However, I suggest you bundle your young ones under the blankets, turn down the lights, and enjoy this movie. Recommended!

This is one of the most freshman movies ever. But, like any good car wreck, you can't take your eyes off it. It is side-splittingly funny in parts. Is there actually a story here??? Yes, there is...and it is not too terribly bad. Sophmoric humor is too much of a compliment, so I call this one "freshman humor". The gratuitious nudity at the beginning is just dumb, but the rest fits the plot. And in the end, what's not to like...it is about BEER after all...

I really think that the title of this review says it all. The effects in this film are berathtaking, but the performances turned in by the supporting cast are sub-par. Bacon and Shue do an okay job in their roles. Not my favorite Bacon movie, but not bad either. The supporting cast, however, either don't know how to act or they were handed really bad dialogue. Ignore that part of the movie. No worse than many "classic" horror films. This is still a fun film to watch.

Bought this specific blade for trimming a Goldendoodle for summer. The blade moves easily through the coat and is easy to keep clean and cool. The nice thing about the Andis UltraEdge system is how fast you can switch blades between dogs. Each of our pooches require a different blade setting, so swapping them out is a snap. The price for this item was considerably less than what you will pay in a retail store, so Amazon is the only way to go! Highly Recommended!

Much more of a dark comedy than most of the crap movie translations would have you believe. Cyrano is a classic in every sense of the word and by far my favorite play. Too many times this exquisite work is turned into a comic mess by the schmucks in Hollywood. Do not settle for anything less than the original.

This film is a brilliant and honest look at one man's obsession. The story told here is not so much one about saving bears as it is about how far a person will go to escape reality. Treadwell was not a scientist nor was he learned about the true nature of animals, however he had a passion and he stuck with that passion up until his final moments. Was he crazy, insane or mentally ill...maybe, but that does not detract from the importance of his underlying message. Sometimes it takes someone who is a little "off" to show the world how "off" everything else truly is. Getting a glimpse of Treadwell's unedited moments were what truly brought this film home. Without seeing that, the viewer would have had much less understanding about who the man really was. Emotional, riveting, and wonderfully put together. So much more than just a nature film. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

A movie about a down-and-almost-out boxer that FOR ONCE doesn't blast the entire sport of boxing. That alone could have made this film a masterpiece (or at least one of a kind). Anyone with a passion for the sweet Science will find this film well worth watching, as will anyone who seeks a drama that doesn't bore the viewer with the typical Hollywood schtick. Jackson steals his own film. You will hang on every line. Highly recommended!

Prometheus is a worthy prequel to the Alien franchise. However, keep in mind, this is not Alien. This is a whole new set of creatures, a whole new set of questions, and very few real answers. This film focuses on the reality behind asking questions that may not even have a satisfactory answer. It also shows how one answer just leads to a new array of questions. The film is true eye-candy for the scifi fan in every sense of the word. From the opening scene to the final moments, you cannot take you eyes off the screen. Reading the other reviews, it seems like those who don't like this film either do not understand the history behind it, are not intrigued by the bigger mysteries of life, or are just wanting to munch their popcorn to other mindless schlock that Hollywood barfs out and calls movies thee days. Prometheus is going to make you think and entertain you while doing so. If you are up for the adventure, then check it out.

I have read this book (actually the hardcover) several times and even cited it as resource material for a college paper (back in the day). Powerfully written. Each reader has to make up their own mind about the subject matter, but there is no denying the talent which Hopkins possesses when he puts pen to paper. Arguably one of the finest pieces of work in its class/genre. You will not be disappointed.

Let's start with the comment that this movie is visually stunning. One could turn off the audio and be dazzled by the sheer brillance of the videography. However, if one did that, they would miss one of the best tales of true survival EVER placed on the big screen. The book details the events more clearly, but there is no lack of drama, suspense, passion or emotion in the feature film. In the same league with "Into Thin Air" (the book), this film is an ABSOLUTE MUST for ANY mountaineer, climber, or adventure traveler.

This is a great movie. The part about the police detectives is actually very accurate...some just have no common sense. Overall, this is a great, violent, vulgar roller-coaster ride. If you want a cool folow-up to a bloody free-for-all like Reservoir Dogs, then GET THIS MOVIE. It is a steal when you can get it in most retail outlets for less than $10. The critics about how these guys can be "saints" just don't get it...

I am pretty sure that those who give this product a negative review are either: Unable to understand a hand-crank or Have damaged their DVD/CD (due to their own negligence) so badly that nothing would fix it and they expect a miracle to intervene and correct their stupidity. This product works FLAWLESSLY when used correctly. I have used it to fix HUNDREDS of DVDS without a single problem. I have yet to find a DVD that I can't fix with this product. I routinely "rent/borrow" DVDs from the library and you can only imagine what type of condition those things are in. Once used it to fix the entire set of "24 Season One" that I got from the library. I also bought a bunch of Xbox 360 games from a video store that was going out of business. This product buffed them all right up (and you know how most kids handle video games). I cannot recommend this product enough! I have one suggestion for the negative reviewers...try keeping your discs in CASES instead of those horrible CD/DVD "sleeve books"...those things are most likely the cause of all your problems! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Brilliant and eerie, exactly the way a monster movie should be. Those blasting this movie just don't "get it". The Instant Gratification Generation needs everything explained to them and on top of that they want ALL the facts spoon fed to them. If that's what you're looking for, Cloverfield is not your movie. This film is deeper than most dramas, more suspenseful than most thrillers, and better than any recent monster type film. I have to admit, while stylistically perfect for the film, I grew tired of the shaky camera work. That is probably the only reason I won't watch this film twice...at least not for a while. This film is creepy the way all good horror/monster films should be. It harkens back to a day when simple elements of light (a la Creature From The Black Lagoon) create suspense. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

When all is said and done one has to admit that if "they" had listened to Marcinko then maybe some true terrorist threats could have been averted. These guys did what they were supposed to do. Just like most jobs, do it too well and someone will come down on you. The film is short, but for a rental, worth the price. Tame by today's standards, but they only showed us what they "wanted" to show us. I think it stands on its own!

This film finds its best moments in the opening credits, before the title "Hostel" ever hits the screen. After that point, it is a quagmire of useless, non-relevent, sex-scenes and expressions of drug use. After trudging through the first half of the movie, dealing with unrelated mentionings about the female anatomy, one hopes the movie will reach a higher standard and show the horror that was promised. The only horror here, is the filmaking itself. While the premise behind the movie is an interesting idea, the filmaker seemed too busy with style over imagery and symbolism over substance. The film never scares the viewer. It even falls short of being anything disturbing. A true waste.

Kameo is fun from start to finish, which is actually the only problem with the game...it's too short. You can find this title at a better price from different sites, but it is worth $20. Powerful graphics and terrific gameplay make this a must have, especially for the younger audience. Kameo will go down as one of the best premiere titles for the 360.

There is no doubt that this album will go down in history as one of the BEST albums EVER. The creative writing of the well thought lyrics string this album together like nothing I've seen since Graceland (obviously different genre). Each and every song stands alone, but at the same time completes the intricate package that is AUGUST. So many other songwriters could learn from this compilation. This album is where all the musical talent the universe has been hiding has gone. Nothing short of perfect.

I am not going to rehash the plot of the movie the way WAY TOO MANY reviewers do these days. Instead I am going to give you all you need to know. Go watch this film! It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date. Granted, the original story was "updated" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days. That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming). However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST. WHY? Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero. What novel concept! Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved. You got this one right! This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Others have covered the details sufficiently, so I will stick to a simple review. This sequel was one of those rare films that was as good as the original in every aspect. When a sequel is this good, it doesn't have to rehash the first film, it can just get on with the story telling. Fine work, a worthy watch, enjoy!

I went into this film with extremely low expectations. I used to watch the animated Aeon Flux series which was very well done, if not somewhat confusing. Bringing Aeon Flux to the big screen actually IMPROVES upon the original. The film fleshes out the the story/history of Aeon Flux and actually makes the entire premise understandable. This film was an enjoyable ride with some interesting special effects, some were good, some were lacking (I found all the blood in the film very fake). Overall, this film is a good watch for anyone interested in sci-fi (even if not totally original). The film stands on its own without any viewing of the animated series. Four stars = above average. Aeon Flux gets a well deserved four stars.

This book is great for anyone who wants to learn certain nuances of the net and what is lying just beneath the surface. Savvy net users will even find a trick or two in this volume to assist in "tweaking" their net experience. Take a chance and try to learn something new. This book has something for everyone.

Not as bad as some reviews state, but not a great movie either. Funny moments to be sure. The problem is, the movie had a lot more potential that it didn't even attempt to reach. Sandler fans will enjoy this film, others will see it the same as most of his movies...senseless with little real humor. Sandler needs to mature and go back to making truly good films like Big Daddy. This could have been that good with less lame cameos and more humorous "cross cultural banter".

I remember the old reviews of this movie which was once called, "The scariest movie since Silence of the Lambs." That reviewer must not watch many movies...and this must have been the first one they watched since watching Silence of the Lambs. This movie is not only NOT scary (even by older standards) I cringe at the idea that it is called a "horror classic," This IS NOT a horror movie. A psychological thriller, maybe, but not a horror movie. Actually it would be a three-four star psych-thriller, but don't bill a movie as something it's not. This was a HUGE disappointment.

This game can sedate the bloodlust and battle-envy of most gamers, but only if purchased at the used price. Paying full price, gamers will feel let down with the lack of story, plot, or anything coherent. The gameplay itself is fun, but somewhat a little repetitive. I am not saying this is a bad game, there are just better games in the same genre that are currently on the market.

This is by far one of the finest books I have ever read. Those giving it bad reviews fear the truths the book reveals. Yes, it is a &quot;page-turner&quot; and yes, it moves at breakneck speed, but that is what a good book is supposed to do. I could not put it down and frankly, didn't want to. Dan Brown has written a masterpiece that will live throughout the ages. Are all the ideas original? No, but it took brown to bring them into the mainstream and make it a convincing enjoyable read. Don't let the zealots keep you from reading this book!!!

These hooks are great. I have used them for everything you can imagine. They are surprisingly strong and support a good deal of weight. The pack comes with extra adhesive, so if you have to relocate them you can. When you remove the hooks, simply follow the instructions and there is no mess, no mar, and no damage to the surface. An excellent product! Definitely no complaints here.

I have used this product as well as the TUB SURROUND version and I have to say that I am not overly impressed. The claim of "immediate tackiness" is not quite accurate. It took a longer time that implied to "set-up". While I am a fan of other Loctite products, these adhesives could be a lot better. When making a decision to buy a product like this at the hardware store, one usually only has the product label to go on. This one was lacking.

Okay, let's look at this from an objective point of view. I bought this product for one of our baby pomeranians who has terrible allergies in the spring and summer. This is after going to the vet and having him prescribe this exact item. Now, the vet charged $14 for 20 pills. Here at Amazon I got 100 pills for right around $3.50. Time for the "common sense test." What do you think is the better bargain? Anyway, this medication works wonderfully and now our pom is no longer wheezing and panting on those hazy, lazy spring/summer days. If you have any doubts, do yourself a favor and just buy this product here. You will not be disappointed.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon how much money I want to make) one of my jobs is to be exposed to concert halls and extremely loud music (which I typically despise). These little ear plugs have become a lifesaver. I already have bad enough hearing and I don't need it damaged any further by club owners or show promoters who are too stupid to turn down the sound. If they won't do it, then I will do it for them and protect what little hearing I have left for my old age. Hearos come in a nice travel case and are washable after use (if needed). I found the sound dampening quality good for my purpose and won't hit the road without them. Save yourself the headache and cut out the chaos with a this simple purchase of a quality product. You will not be disappointed! Highly Recommended!

The best advice I can give, regarding this book, is to GIVE it to a young person interested in science or space. You will plant a seed that will grow forever. Sagan's masterpiece takes the mind on a wonderful journey through the stars as well as through other space centered events. Highest recommendation as a text for learning as well as a fine read for anyone interested in the subject.

Let me first address all the reviews that compare this film to Apocalypto...there is ONE major difference, this movie is actually GOOD. Pure fun from start to finish. Is it totally fast paced...NO, but the film is trying to tell a historical/fiction STORY. That is where Gibson's dull flop missed the boat. Now, the special effects are nothing to write home about, but the pure beauty of the costumes and landscape more than makes up for it. BC packs twice as much STORY into its 90 minutes than most of the 2+ hour schlock that comes out of Hollywood these days. An interesting perspective on historical possibilities makes the film even more interesting. Acurate in every detail, probably not, but possible/plausible all the same, sure. Give it a chance, once it gets rolling, this is pure popcorn-munching madness. Personally, I can't wait for 9999 BC. Recommended for pure summer/storm DVD fun!

This has got to be one of the worst business/wealth building books I have ever read. Out of boredom, I got this for free off the internet while surfing the web LATE one night. I would never have paid for a book like this. I just want a chance to warn others before they think about purchasing this rag. If you get it for free it does make for nice bonfire kindling if folded properly. Other than that, I cannot think of any good use for this book. Infomercial in a can...and that's where this book belongs.

My problem with KOTOR:II is the whole "I've got to start all over" feel to the game. There should have been a way for the game to acknowledge that you played through the first in the series, and allowed the player to level up faster or skip certain aspects. It would have felt like a "true sequel" that way. It is still a great game, but it is not the original. My hope is for a better follow-up on the 360 platform.

There is nothing not to like about The Incredibles! As with all the best recent animated films, the jokes may be over a kid's head, but that is what keeps the parents buying the tickets. The Incredibles is a fun look at heros similar to the ones we all grew up with...only a little older. This is one of those movies that is so good you hope the DON'T make a sequel. A sequel would only cheapen this originally funny film. After all, there really is nothing to add to this imaginative piece of art.

I went into watching this film with quite a bit of apprehension. I had unfortunately listened to all the ostriches who have their heads conveniently buried in the sand. Mr. Gore, who I was previously no fan of, presented his theory with conviction and sound science. The delivery is in no way dry or monotone as some of the other lying reviews claim. You can feel the "establishment" ooze off these other reviews. It is easier for them to ignore the problem than face the truth. Anyone who hasn't personally felt the effects of climate change has not been outside their house over the last 20 years. You owe it to yourself to watch this film and think critically about these issues presented. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Candid, stunning, amazing. Those who listen to Teddy Atlas are forever wrapped up in his passion for life and boxing. More than a boxing book, this is the true story of how to become a man. Mr. Atlas' candor and straight talk leave little to the imagination. Others talk tough, Teddy Atlas is tough. He doesn't try to hide his own misdeeds, he presents them in the context of reality. Anyone who reads this books is instantly indebted to Mr. Atlas for his wisdom.

This is one of those albums that hits you in the chest and leaves you breathless. A mix of bluesy/rock angst compiled with lyrics that provoke thought and emotion drive this album. Hiatt has never been short on talent but this album was a breakthrough on so many levels. There are so few albums of this caliber on the market. That also helps Hiatt ascend to the top with GUITAR. This album will leave you wanting more, not because Hiatt hasn't done his job, but because so many others don't. The HIGHEST recommendation!

I picked this game up at a "going out of business sale" (all too common these days). I bought it based on the subject matter (aliens and Area 51) and less on actual facts or reviews. First off, this is actually a really fun game. Short, about 4-6 hours. I think that is the first thing that truly surprised me. Is it original (from a FPS point of view), no. The shooting is basic, the targeting isn't always "spot on" (i.e. sometimes you don't need to hit your target to get them to fall), the "squad commands" are generic, and the driving takes some getting used to...but it is STILL FUN! For what it is, it delivers! The dialogue will make you laugh, which is perfect since this game doesn't take itself too seriously. I think any gamer who goes into this game with a similar attitude won't be disappointed. My only two major gripes are more of pet-peeves than actual complaints. So many developers take a ton of time trying to get details correct (guns, uniforms, vehicles, etc.) which is to be commended. However, inevitably in ANY and ALL games these days there is a bathroom you can walk into. Sorry to tell you guys, bathrooms in the Middle East (specifically Iraq) are significantly different from American/European bathrooms (if you've been there, you know what I mean). If you are going to take the "cheese route" and put these particular details in a game, make sure you have it right. Also, what ever happened to big, dramatic endings in video games? Playing the older games (NES, Sega Genesis, etc) the ending cinematic was always the "pay-off." Too many games these days lack this simple item. They waste tons of time on cinematic elements throughout the game that only serve to break-up game play and then get stingy with the finale. That is more a comment on all games these days rather than just Blacksite. Other than that, Blacksite: Area 51 is a fun game. I would recommend it highly, especially if you get it for less than $15.

I'm going to get right ot the point here. This movie is WAY too drawn out. The acting by anyone besides Ms. Stiles is trivial, non-believable, and just plain bad. The plot will keep you guessing until just about the end...and that is the best I can say.Now, for my blast at the rating...The movie is rated "R". The opening pre-credit says, "contains explicit sexuality". When I'm warned about something, I expect to see it. There isn't so much as a nude scene in this film. The "R" is actually for language...dropping the F-Bomb a couple times.Lame and not worth the time.

This series has gone and blown away the mold of the police drama. Soars FAR above everything else that is currently out there. By the time Vic and the strike team are through, police shows will never be the same. This series is a must for anyone who is starving for unpredictable, unprecedented action/drama/excitement. It is never what it seems. The Shield comes at the viewer from so many different directions that it keeps the viewer guessing to the end of each and every episode. I can only give this series the HIGHEST possible recommendation!

While I truly believe the title of this post, I hope the next couple efforts are a little more solid. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun ride, but from all the previews I expected more puzzle solving and quest than this film provided. It was fun and fast-paced in the Disney tradition. Cage does another outstanding job (one of the greatest actors of this generation). The ending was a little cheap, but what can you say, take the movie for what it is...While Lucas and Spielberg are busy screwing up their classic films with PC remakes, I hope Cage provides us with a hero that doesn't change through the ages. Great work, great cast!

This film was a strong, family-fun addition to what has been a dry couple months of DVD releases. I would have liked a little more backstory on the creatures and less discussion of the family. I would have also liked to see more diversity in the creatures and preferred less reality and more fantasy. The books are filled with interesting tidbits that seem glossed over, but what can you expect from Hollywood today (they don't expect you to be able to read, after all). The film still stands well on its own. Mostly family friendly except for a couple of rough action sequences and an ill-timed, almost-profanity at the film's conclusion. Just don't expect Froud or Narnia. Recommended!

There are far more exhaustive reviews of this product, but I thought I'd add my two cents because I am just "that impressed" with this item. First lets start with a little history. I have been trying various products in this category for over twenty years. I can't honestly say I've tried them "all," but I have tried and wasted my money on more than many other people. This is the FIRST and only one that I have found that met my expectations and...get this...actually tastes awesome! Isopure blends smooth. Now, most of the time with products like these you get the "clumps" or powder that sticks to the side of the blender. Let me repeat, this product blends SMOOTH. No clumps or "stickiness" whatsoever. You will not find a commercial smoothy that is smoother than this product. Second, the taste is absolutely the best tasting protein powder drink I have ever found. Period, full stop, end of discussion. You know why? Because it tastes like bananas, not "banana flavor." Isopure does it right! Now lets throw in the factors that it has zero carbs and is lactose free. Does it get any better? Short answer, no. There are those who have stated (both in reviews and at the gym) that this product is a little "pricey." This is the perfect example of "you get what you pay for." I have no problem with the price of this item at Amazon. Elsewhere, like the rip-off nutrition centers, they jack up the price outrageously. Buy it here and skip the retail nonsense. To bring this to a close, shelf your doubts and take the plunge. You will not be disappointed. More than Highly Recommended!

This film was a true worthy follow-up to one of the best superhero films of all time. Inspired by the storyline from the late 80s 'Armor Wars' arc, Iron Man 2 has our hero fighting against his invention being weaponized while at the same time fighting those who are stealing his tech. There is no one who can pull off Tony Stark like Robert Downey Jr. His portrayal is worth watching even if he never dons the suit. This is good, because Iron Man gets very little screen time against his alter ego in this installment. A perfect precusor to Avengers and Thor, with a slight nod to Captain America. You cannot go wrong here!

This is by far one of the BEST RPG/style games ever released for the 360. Tied, possibly, with Oblivion, Mass Effect takes the player on a galaxy-hopping adventure as the background story unfolds with each new mission. Could it be better? Sure. Allowing training for ANY weapon regardless of class would be nice. Also, the overall learning curve is VERY STEEP. Those few items aside, Mass Effect draws the player in deeper and deeper with each passing gaming episode. Not for everyone, since not everyone is an RPG fan, but for the RPG fan, it is a surefire hit. Recommended!

A fun CD with a mix of some of Jimmy's early song style. A long way from the island-hopping, beach music that made him famous. Similar albums would include: High Cumberland Jubilee, Down To Earth, or Before The Beach. Classic singer/songwriter/folk fans MIGHT also find something here for their tastes. Others would probably be better served looking elsewhere for entertainment.

5.11 shirts are by far the most superior product on the market for the tactical professional. Plenty of cargo space and unique touches make these shirts a must have. They stand up to rugged terrain and hostile situations. You will not find a more durable line of clothing. HIGHLY Recommended!

Credit to Gibson's vision. However, when people rave about how brutal and violent a movie is, I expect brutal violence. This film was neither brutal nor violent, considering the context. It was extremely reserved compared to what it could have been. I applaud Gibson's dedication to reality and using the original dialect, however, this tactic detracts from being able to adequately develop characters. This is a film that should have been 90 minutes or 3 hours. As it was, it should have been 90 minutes of action/drama. I would have preferred a film that was 3 hours long that presented characters that I actually cared about. How can I care whether a guy gets his heart cut out, if I don't even know anything about that character? This film could have been so much more. I was disappointed.

The only reason most people bought this game was for the Halo 3 beta. That is the simple bottom line in this game. The game itself is too easy and you can bypass too much of it. There is something to be said for "open world" games, but this takes it to the extremes. You literally do not have to do anything except kill the bosses. How lame is that? Games are being pushed out the door without any imput form true gamers. That has been a problem with the industry for years. This, unfortunately is no exception. Maybe a sequel can save this game from itself.

I will not waste time heaping on the high praise that this film deserves, because it has all already been written in other reviews. I will simply state that I truly enjoyed this movie, until the end. Since I don't believe in spoiling a movie for the non-viewer I will not go into detail other than I am referring to the final actual "conflict". Still worth 4 stars. Not "Vampires", and not "Near Dark" (two of the genre's finest), but damned high up there all the same.

Burton and Depp have done it again with Sweeney Todd. A downright beautiful, macabre masterpiece in every sense of the word. However, feel free to call me uncultured when I was surprised that this was a MUSICAL. I'm glad I didn't know ahead of time because I never would have given it a chance. The surprise was bloody glorious! High praise for this film!

Land of the White Death is a powerful true account of a tragic expedition into the northern Russian arctic that few people are probably aware. Reprinted from Albanov's own diaries, one cannot get a better first hand account of this epic adventure. Albanov's dialogue brings to life the tragedy and utter hopelessness of being stranded on the ever-moving ice of the arctic. He truly delivers the facts that this area is a huge, moving, living land, not a solid mass. In this powerful delivery, Albanov never losses faith in his own ability to return home. He honestly recounts the strength's and weaknesses of the entire expedition and is unapologetic for his feelings that some of the team were just too weak or unmotivated to find the will to live. Albanov's book is an absolute MUST READ for anyone interested in adventure travel or expedition narrative. For anyone who wants a "pure read" of the book, I would skip David Robert's introduction, it reveals a little too much of the tale. That is no slight against Mr Roberts, an EXCELLENT writer in his own right, but this introduction gives a little too much away for my tastes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I don't use the term "masterpiece" lightly. Yes, in the same league as Into Thin Air, but a COMPLETELY different book. This book will make the couch-sitter-mountaineers steer clear of the hills. It will make the true adventures start sorting gear. Brill does not pull any punches and his dedication to getting the "details" correct is to be commended. Throughout the book, he answers questions so many are afraid to ask, or simply normally don't think about (such as what it's like to relieve oneself in the sub-arctic). Every word is relevant, and when Brill does repeat himself, it is necessary and within the context of the moment. An absolute MUST HAVE for any climber, mountaineer or adventurer! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

It seems that as soon as the letters WWE come up on the screen, too many people discredit a movie. I wish they would do the same when watching studio Hollywood crap. Oh no, they buy right into that schlock and ask for more. They have no clue.See No Evil is a GREAT horror/slasher film. It adds a nice variety to the massacre genre. Now, it doesn't stray too far from the "bad-kids-get-what-they-deserve" ideology that pervades almost all horror/slasher films, but it is original in it's delivery of the antagonist. I wish the film had had time to "flesh out" the characters a little more before they were rendered. Movie makers need to realize that horror fans aren't like most attention-span-deprived movie goers. The film makers could benefit from giving us a little more time and not always trying to cram a film into 90 minutes.I've rambled enough about this one. Thumbs Up for See No Evil. Well worth the watch!

Everest: BTL is an amazing DVD that captures the drama of a diverse group of climbers and their attempt to summit Everest. While not technically exhaustive, the DVD is presented in more of a "reality show" format that draws you into the human struggle of the ascent. The DVD focuses on both the strengths and the weaknesses of the men who are attempting to summit the greatest mountain on Earth. That being said, ANY CLIMBER who has ever stepped foot on a mountain knows that many treks (ESPECIALLY EVERST) have been corrupted into purely commercial "events". However, to focus on that aspect and miss the larger picture is the sign of an unrealistic, mountaineering mind. We can't go back in time and change what these types of climbs have become. Accept it and move forward. Some can, some can't...just like climbing the mountain. It needs to be said however, that each and every man and woman who place their feet on Everest have already proved everything they need to prove. As far as the dead climber (Sharp) controversy, it should be noted that there was nothing these men could do that would have saved that poor soul that wouldn't have also cost their own lives. Not worth it. Each person knows the score when attempting Everest. This is nothing compared to the tragedy of the 1996 expedition. I would suggest that those who are overly concerned about this aspect of the 2006 expedition have never faced true tragedy in their lives or been in unique, "team-centered" experiences (such as combat) where the survival of the group is paramount. While in safe, secure, civilized society we would all do everything in our power to save a human life, combat and an "assault" on Everest are different scenarios where (unfortunately) different rules apply. Overall, outstanding presentation. The avid climber will find enough here to keep them interested and have them trying on their boots and dusting off their gear in the off-season. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This is a classic, rare book that contains some of the best stories from American folklore. This edition was written long before the censors got their hands on these tales and made them politically correct for the modern era. These are the original, raw tellings! Some of the stories found within, you will find no where else. It is fascinating to read other tales in this tome that have been rewritten, and compare them to the originals found here. A must have addition to any folklore enthusiast!

This is a great little guide: direct, to the point, and informative. Keep in mind at 48 pages (actually 24 front and back) is is brief to say the least. However, the information packed in those few pages follows the concrete, traditional, field guide design. The Guide To Listings at the end of the book, along with the great drawings and maps are well worth the price. The problem is, with shipping, you are paying way too much. Keep in mind, I think this is a wonderful book, but it amazes me that the cover price was originally $6.95. I happened upon this guide at a local used book store for $2.50, so I can truly say that I am in no way disappointed. There are far better, exhaustive, tomes on the topic, but as a quick read, this guide can't be beat. Recommended!

A great movie. How long would it take you to realize that a zombie invasion was taking place in your community/life? I think we all walk around in this same haze throughout our lives. But social commentary aside, "Shaun of the Dead" rivals all of the other zombie flicks out there. It truly stands alone as a satire/horror movie. When it needs to be funny, it delivers. When it needs to be gruesome, it also delivers. One of the few horror films that takes the time to develop the characters in the film.

The ONLY reason this movie even rates one star is for its soundtrack. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. The opening scene has a guy in MOTORCYCLE boots apparently searching southern China and finding a grave with an amulet (not to mention a fake skull - closed eye sockets?). From that lame point on, the movie declines into a total mess. The story is never believable and the reality/fantasy mix is TERRIBLE. Random teleportation throughout the movie? Police crime scene team "misses" a HUGE charm necklace in the space of a bathroom stall? Come on! What should I have expected from a movie staring an outspoken Wiccan? The movie further insults other religions in furtherance of its plot. Terrible. Just Terrible.

As the title of the review states, this is an excellent adventure travel book. Messner goes further than many of the armchair anthropologists by slugging through the Himalayas in an attempt to confirm his hypothesis. While I found the lack of true "scientific data" (before drawing a conclusion) a little disturbing, that does not detract from this well thought out, and contrary to other reviews, well written book. It is worth noting that the idea that the large footprints discovered were the result of a bear "consistently" stepping in the print made by its front paws is laughable, but that was my only major gripe. It starts off like a high speed adventure thriller and then slows to a reasonable pace as it presents the facts (as Messner knows them). It is a very fast read, so I would suggest the library or the "lowest price" option if one is considering buying the book. All the same, a SOLID four stars and a recommendation for this book.

I have to admit that I can only play this game for a little while at a time. There is only so much mayhem to cause before I get bored and go back to some other 360 title. It will probably take me forever to finish it. So far, I have enjoyed the robust story. The gameplay is pretty intuitive also. However, Rockstar, as always, hits a few negative spots with me. First, missions that are way too complicated or simplistic mixed in at the same "level". Second, the opening/loading cutscene...hey Rockstar, I don't want to have to see this stupid hooker sucking on her lollypop every time I play the game...I should be able to skip this. Third, being able to interact with everything is cool...I can steal any car, but can't get into any building or break any window...just odd. On the same note, why is it that the hood can fly off my car, but if I clip an OPEN car door in traffic, it wrecks the WHOLE car? Shouldn't the door just get snapped off? All the same, a worthy addition to the franchise. Problem is, GTA isn't my favorite series. Only 3 stars.

Up front I have to admit that the acting in this film was HORRIBLE. Now, getting past that, the story was an awesome blend of traditional sci-fi pulp and modern story-telling. The complexity of the story did not transfer well to the big screen, however. This would probably have been a bigger cult hit if it had been shipped direct to dvd and not exposed to the simple minds of most reviewers. Not the typical Hollywood schlock...which accounts for the negative press. Die hard MNS fans will appreciate the story...others will get lost.

The SAW franchise is still going strong. This film "fleshes" out the entire Saw continuity. It was hard to imagine what the film would be like without it's two main leads, but fear not...the games go on. I feel that by the time this series reaches its conclusion, it will be obvious why this particular film was so important. Highly recommended for Saw fans and horror fans alike.

Way better than expected. Stone Cold Steve Austin is as much fun to watch on the big screen as he was when he was a superstar in the WWE. This movie sets a nice, high bar for action adventure. Far better than the played out and repeated crap that usually comes out of Hollywood. It is time to start taking some of these stars seriously, as they a far more entertaining than most of the rest of the Hollywood stable. I look forward to Stone Cold's next venture into film. If it is half as exciting as this, it will be a hit in my book.

From the opening scene, it is obvious that Eyes of the Mothman is not your typical cryptozoological film. This is not a movie designed to hype a phenomena or create a false sense of intensity by exaggerating evidence. Eyes of the Mothman plays out as a clear, concise, and accurate history of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. In addition, the films shows how the legend of the Mothman plays into that history. With concrete chronology, the film takes the viewer from the Battle of Point Pleasant and the betrayal of Chief Cornstalk all the way through to modern times. The viewer is exposed to a rare, complete picture of the area and how the different legends surrounding Point Pleasant weave together. The film covers the contamination of the area throughout WWII as the famous TNT area became a hub of weapons manufacture and then was seemingly abandoned to decay. The filmmakers interview scientists, residents, researchers, enthusiasts, and witnesses to form the most accurate portrait of the Mothman phenomena. Intertwined with this phenomena are ancient curses, UFO sightings, and a bizarre string of "coincidence." The documentary presents numerous possible explanations while allowing the viewer to draw heir own conclusion. At a little over 2 hours, this is no short film. Nothing is rushed and each topic is given an appropriate amount of time for discussion. This is a must see film for anyone interested in cryptozoology and the Mothman phenomena in particular. The film is written and directed by Matthew J. Pellowski and was released by Red Line Studios.

I am not going to say that this is a great movie. The premise is good, but the story drags on far too long. It is a very accurate portrayal of the government's disregard for soldiers' welfare and the fallout of an ill-conceived conflict. It is difficult to separate politics from a review due to the nature of the film. The film is not lacking because of what it portrays or the way it portrays it, it is lacking in the overall style of the filmmaker. I give it four stars because of the honest approach it takes to a difficult subject. Right or wrong, many young people are dying.

Good story if you can get past the crappy beginning. The FX are awesome in most scenes and then seem trivial and pathetic in others. Don't get me wrong, overall I liked the movie. A great comic adaptation, but the average viewier is going to be picking this thing apart. Okay...you like comics??? RENT, do not buy this movie. After you see what it offers, make your buying decision. Personally, the dialogue and creaive charaters (except the main crappy villian) kept me interested enough to RENT a sequel. It's sad that SO MUCH good movie was damaged by bits and pieces of bad...Still, worth the rental.

Currently using this product as part of a tree-climbing rig. Absolutely love it! Paired with the Petzl Grigri 2, you have a bomb-proof system (provided you have the adequate training and skills to pull it off). I also plan to to use this ascender for more traditional rope work in the Spring. In addition, I like this so much that I will likely buy two more (another right hand and a left hand version). The price can't be beat and the reputation of Petzl speaks for itself. Highly Recommended!

This film is pure adrenaline from the moment it opens. I will not rehash the plot of the film, as some other reviews have revealed too much in the way of spoilers already. Solid and enjoyable. Quaid makes his mark and shows that he still has what it takes to be an action/drama hero. I can only guess that the negative reviews came from the pro-war crowd who were expecting the type of "bang-em-up-shoot-em-up-kill-fest" that Hollywood excels at stuffing down the gullet of the ignorant masses. If that is what you are looking for, Vantage Point is NOT your film. This is an EXCITING, thought-provoking, thrill-ride without the typical dumbed-down delivery. The film flows smoothly and is not forced in any fashion. The flashbacks add to the intensity and anticipation. The movie's message is clear in the final minutes, as all the pieces fall into place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Okay, for the most part I enjoyed the film. It was a great translation of the Wells classic. Problems arise with too many scenes of a screaming kid and a malcontent son. These do not play well against Cruise's portrayal of a man truly concerned with survival (not only his own, but the world's). Another problem...the aliens were cut-rate for Spielberg. Too similar to Independence Day and other mainstream films. Why is is that when a director makes an "alien movie" with depth, they only give a glimpse of the aliens and do not allow the viewer to see more of the creatures? The aliens IS what the movie is about after all. As an action film alone I would give it a 3...but the drama bumps it up to a 4 in my book.

This is a fine western film that may get lost among others that have higher profiles. The morale conflicts create a film that transcends the typical western schtick, which is why some people have given it negative reviews. Granted, the film could have had a stronger ending, keeping more in line with the exposed morale of Crowe's character. It is that reason alone that this film gets 4 instead of 5 stars. If you like quality westerns with plenty of chase scenes, 3:10 is right up your dusty street.

This is a great book for anyone looking for a very scholarly look at the Koran and the world of Islam. It must be said that this is a brief overview of a very complex subject. The book it jam-packed with information 'about' the Koran, but does not spend much time on 'explaining' the beliefs behind the Koran. This is in no way a substitute for study of the Koran, if that is what the reader is looking for. As a very educated text, this book stands far above many others. It was not what I was personally seeking, but that does not take away from the quality of this text.

Any fan of hoaxes and anyone who actually checks into scams before falling for them will not find anything new here. The book was interesting in parts and very funny at times. Since the book was written in 2006 it is already dated as far as the information goes. It is hard to keep a tome like this truly up to date with unique information. A quick read/browse at best. You can find it at the library for free which is where I suggest you peruse it to your hearts content. Take a look, but you've been warned before you buy.

Movies that are billed as comedies should not have numerous, terrible pauses while waiting for a laugh-track that isn't coming. Fey deserved a better script to showcase her talent. Not sure how Kinear got mixed up in this flop. Steve Martin, well, Steve Martin is the ONLY reason to watch this movie. His over-the-top enviro-guy was hysterical. The rest of this movie crashed and burned. It was a good concept lost in a bad script with choppy editing and non-funny jokes. Avoid!

I am not sure when it became "cool" to bash Stephen King, but most of the reviews here that do are shallow and contrite. Much like the overlooked Dreamcatcher, The Mist takes the viewer on a thrill ride packed with characters who represent the extremes in everyday life. But isn't that what you are supposed to do in a film about the microcosm of society pressed into two hours? I am not going to give any simple recap of the film, because reviews like that are useless. Here's what you need to know...if you like creepy, gut-wrenching horror that packs an intelligent and unapologetic punch, then The Mist is right up your alley. This is the fun, classic King at his best (a la Creep Show). There were two items that bothered me about the film, however. The "creature" too similar to the ones from Dreamcatcher....and, if we're going to use a "parallel dimension" as the cause for the creatures...I think more creativity could have gone into their design. That being said, this movie is clearly in my top ten horror films of all time list. Highly Recommended!!!

Okay, the first thing that you need to know about this product is that all it is a length of nylon strap with two slide-buckles. That is it. That is all there is to it. Now, if this is something you need and you're willing to pay $11 for a single piece of nylon strap, well then, more power to you. I expected more. I expected at least a set of instructions showing the different uses for the product, but found myself having to go to the manufacturer's website to get some ideas. Also, if you plan on using this as a chest harness (certainly not load bearing) to keep an ascender or similar device in place, you should know that there is not much strap here. You will be hard pressed to get this around your body (as diagramed on the website) if you are over 190lbs. If you are bigger than that, forget it. There are far better &#34;placement-style&#34; harnesses on the market. You could make this one yourself in about 10 minutes (and $3) with a trip to Michael's or JoAnn Fabrics. If you are lazy, and still need a piece of nylon strapping, go ahead and spend the $11 and get this one. Best of luck to you.

Tourist Season is a rapid fire, lightning fast read that brings together all the things that make a book a classic. This is just plain fun from start to finish. The macbre horror is mixed with humor so perfectly that you catch yourself rooting for both sides. As another review stated, "Terrorism was once funny"...this is from a more innocent time, where not-so-innocent acts attempt to fight against a stark and sad reality. The hero of the story is just as torn as the reader as things just seem to get worse all the time. Tourist Season is not a mystery by any stretch of the imagination, but it is an awesome read that I highly reccomend. Any reader who is also a Jimmy Buffet fan will find the inspiration for more than one of his songs as well as a slew of lines that made it into his lyrics. Just plain cool! A MUST read!

Haters be damned, Halo 3 still sets THE STANDARD for multiplayer enjoyment. Yes, the entire Halo story (single player) is a bit disjointed and each game since the first has been too short, but who really buys Halo for the SINGLE PLAYER? Halo 3 is all about ONLINE MULTIPLAYER killin'! It really is that simple. Bungie has expanded character customization (FINALLY). Overall, this game has the most re-playability of ANY game currently on the market. For an entire Halo experience, and to actually understand the story line, I encourage people to pick up the Halo novels. They will flesh out the video game experience and give some of you a little more credibility when you are attempting to talk about this series. Halo 3 is HIGHLY recommended!

Sturdy, rugged, and will fit over IBAs even with SAPI plates. A great little vest. Molle set-up maximizes carrying capacity. Recommended!

While I did not seek this film out, I ended up watching it when I had little else to do. I think that is a shame. This turned out to be a wonderful film that didn't hit the viewer over the head with some "age old" message. Instead, this film presented a well delivered story that was touching and unapologetic. Baby-boomers will find many of the themes familiar, as will anyone with a little life experience. Hit the road and watch this film...or vice versa. Recommended!

Reilly certainly has a way of grabbing you by the short-hairs and never letting go. This is a non-stop action-adventure story that would probably do better in the fantasy section. Keep in mind that this is a purely fictional story (at best) and not try to relate it in any way, shape, or form to reality. With a reccomendation by Richard Marcinko on the cover, one is lead to believe that Reilly's work is going to have the same demand for logical, realistic warfare that Marcinko's novels do. This is not the case at all. While it reads like a summer blockbuster movie, it lacks in the arena of realism. The characters come through as shallow, which is good, because very few make it to the end of the story. Still, the ones that do could use a little fleshing out. Reilly's writing style breaks the fourth wall on far too many occassions. He even interupts his own "thoughts" with action sequences. Not enough of any of the truly mysterious elements are explained to the satisfaction of the reader. That being said, it is a book that you will rip through in no time. It certainly is a great time-killer as long as you know what you're getting into. It is not realistic at all. But that's good, because the real world is not this much fun.

Bar none, this is a FINE offering from Mr. Buffett. My problem is, this is the ONLY album most people who claim to be fans of Jimmy Buffett even own. That in itself is a true shame. Buffett has had much better albums/compilations of his work, but SONGS was still the first to put them all together in a non-live package. One can't argue with the quality since these are all Buffett classics that stand the test of time. Pure summer fun.

This movie shows the "corporate" depravity that exist in so many people. Putting money over all other things never leads to a good end. Overall, I admit that I liked the film. It should have ended about 15 minutes sooner and it would have been EXCELLENT. However, due to that final 15 minute RANT, I can only give the film 3 stars. The ending was unneeded in an otherwise fine film. Lewis does an extraordinary job in his performance, but we even tire of watching his lunacy by the end. Just a RENTAL...nothing more.

Some people claim they had problems with the glitches in this title. I never experienced any such thing. This is by far the best sci-fi RPG ever made for the original Xbox. The story is deep and compelling. Most importantly, it keeps continuity with the original Star Wars story. The feel is classic SW. HIGHLY Recommended.

While this is the best of the "Tales" books, it suffers from the same problems that plague other stories in the SW Universe...canon. What stories are "true", recognized tales of these characters and what is out-of-continuity schlock? Take them for what they are (stories) and have fun learning about characters that existed for mere seconds on film. It is a funny note, that for years when Empire was only available for view on TV (HBO etc) and shown in "full screen" mode that IG-88 isn't even in the film. He is cut out since he is standing at the end of the line. It is also amusing that his tale is one of the best.

Great supplemental material for the criminal investigator. For the common folks out there...learn the tricks that the authorities might be using against you! Like some of the other reviews state, it IS a little rough around the edges. It is still better than what you are going to get in many other books.

The problem with a lot of alleged scientists and hack writers is that they do not do their homework before the spew out a thesis and attempt to get the public to follow them like lemmings. This book is not a representative expose' on the true evidence for the possibility of Bigfoot's existence. As another reviewer put it, the author should have actually gone for a few hikes and explored the country and not just rehashed some schlock that they found in other writers' anti-bigfoot rhetoric. This book displays less about Bigfoot and more about poor writing and research. The publisher must have been blinded by the tabloid title and not even cared about factual information. There are FAR better books on BOTH sides of the "Bigfoot aisle". Just let this one continue to sit and get dusty.

I am amazed that this book is purported on the cover to be a "gothic tale". It is nothing of the sort. While some of the imagery is excellent and SOME of the humor comes through, I found it lacking. Overall the book simply rambles on about things that we later find have no relevance to the story. Just like any good horror tale, describe a scene once and you "got me", describe the SAME thing over and over again and it is nothing but boring. The "reveal" could have happened about 1/2 way through the book and then been used to actually further develop the story. Instead, we are punished and dragged through the morass of this tale to a true anti-climax. I give it two, instead of one, stars because of the humurous murder depictions. Other than that, I would not waste my time on this tale. However, at less than 200 pages it is a quick read...thank God.

This film offers a nice follow-up to the first two Superman movies. Thank God they ignored that crap that passed for Superman III and IV. I could have done without the prolonged explaination of Lois' son. That just got a little old after a while. After about 30 seconds, we all knew whose kid it was. Spacey steals the show as Lex Luther, but even here, we could have done without the bumbling of his henchmen...a criminal mastermind can't hire better help? For what it is, it's a good ride. Superman still delivers.

You just can't take your eyes off this TERRIBLE film. Are you starved for a dose of Bruce Campbell? Ok, then you'll be in your glory. Bruce takes this film to all new levels of, well, who knows what. Campbell is still fun to watch, and his rendition of The King is flawless. If it wasn't for his performance, this film would rate only one star. Campbell saves it...and it achieves a solid two star review. Horrible in every sense of the word, but, yeah baby, you still wanna watch don't you? Well, thank you, thank you very much.

This is a nice little natural energy source. There is a powder form of this product available also, for people who can't do pills/capsules. Only suggestion, if you are using the powder, take a breath mint with you. This stuff, while good for you, can leave a "green" taste in your mouth. The powder doesn't taste bad, but it is not for the neophyte "green drinker". If you are not used to the flavor or texture of "green" drinks, you might want to ease into it or stick with the capsules.

Most non-Buffet fans have never heard of the songs on this album, and that is a true shame. These songs are some of Jimmy's finer work. Following an environmental slant, Hot Water dispenses pure soul in the form of songs like Prince of Tides and That's What Living Is To Me. Probably too thought provoking for the passing Buffett fan. True fans will love this album.

So much of what we see on the classic TZ episodes has been redone to death these days. These are some of the ORIGINAL stories from a classic age of sci-fi suspense. This volumes includes four of the best episodes ever. It really is odd that they put such complete quality on one disc. This volume will not disappoint! Highly recommended.

This is a great game with tons of replay value. The mulitple games and multiple levels of difficulty amke it a easy to play, but still a challenge for more experienced players. This is a GREAT addition to any DS collection. Sure to keep anyone busy on long flights!

Why did this movie get rave reviews? It was too long, too boring, and DID NOT rewrite the "zombie genre" which so many people claimed it did. I found the the plot jumpy and inconsistent. There was no real "feel" of terror. All that being said, I think the main thing that failed this movie was the outside over-hype. It was nothing that I expected, because if it had been, then it would have been good. Sorry, can't recommend this one. However, it is better than the first.

Anyone famliar with feeding a baby knows that bubbles inside a bottle often lead to bubbles inside the baby. Playtex has addressed this with an innovative concept, allowing air to circulate from tha bottom of the bottle. The first thing you will notice is the lack of bubbles inside the bottle, followed by the lack of the familiar "air sucking" sound so many infants make due to sucking in air instead of formula or milk. Less air in equals less air out. We all know what that means. This simple idea has finally found solid engineering and design by the people at Playtex. Worth giving a try.

I can't remember the last time I had such a visceral and emotional reaction to a movie...and no, it didn't have anything to do with him cutting off his arm! This film was powerful on a cerebral, not graphic level. Sure, the blood is there, but nothing more than you would see on network primetime (think CSI). I'm actually surprised it garnered an "R" rating. However, what makes this film better than great is the realization Ralston comes to. In his darkest hour he accepts that he is not perfect and, understanding his own imperfections, moves forward with a survival instinct that would cause many others to crumble. I cannot recommend this film highly enough! For the true adventurer it does not make you afraid of the wild, it makes you want to go out and challenge yourself even further!

By far the best fantasy based RPG for the original Xbox. Endless adventure and customizing options. The story can be a little difficult to follow with so many side quests, but that does not detract from the overall playability of the game. HIGHLY recommended.

I don't know how else to say this, but Hostel II was even worse than the first. The first was a horrible attempt at a "Saw-esque" slasher flick. This doesn't even attempt to be any better. Do not waste your time with this film.

This is by far the best stand alone Star Wars book ever written. The reader does not have to have read any of the other books to understand the story behind "Shadows". This book captures the feel of the original movies and fills in a great deal of missing plot from the films. Highly recommended title!

This book is by far the finest factual account of lycanthropy that exists. It delves into the actual cause of the disease and gives vivid, stirring accounts with historic facts. The most truthful, non-fluff werewolf book you will ever read. If you want the truth and are willing to stomach the depravity of humankind, then definitely pick up the book. It is a classic read that has yet to be duplicated in quality or substance.

This is a fine text and usually required reading for anyone in a white collar crime class. The text has a steady flow of vital information regarding one of the lesser exposed elements of crime in the United States. This may not be the stuff of primetime television, but it is the true representation of what will put people in prison for years. Recommended for the research student!

I had a pair of these boots and used them on the street for two years before they wore out. The comfort of this particualr model is unmatched. I had the original model of these (without the zipper) and that pair lasted the previous two years. The ones with the zipper are THE PERFECT BOOT!

Just because one is a sportswriter does not mean that they can cover all sports accurately. Not all sports have the same depth or the same level of needed understanding. It is all the worse when a sport is covered by someone who had neither a passion for the sport nor any intellectual interest in the sport. Chris Jones really doesn't have any knowledge of the history of boxing that delves deeper than a previous short newspaper clip or a 30 second sound byte.It would be nice if this author would attempt to write at least one complete sentence. How about an attempt not to use "sportswriter" jargon or "present slang". A professional examination of this topic would have been much more digestible.Latching onto the "feel good" character of Otis Grant was sad. The author only attempted to understand his history AFTER his assignment was given. Then he paints Mr. Grant as a helpless figure who is abused and tormented by the evil world of boxing. Oh yeah, forget that Otis Grant loved boxing...This is a read for those with a short attention span and no interest in the true history/reality of boxing. If you like boxing...and good writing...it will just make you sick.

This funky, goofy western is a little piece of 70s film noir that is a must for fans of Jimmy Buffett. One might ask, what was Jimmy doing in this movie??? Well, not much besides playing one of his early signature songs. The plot revolves around an attempt to preserve the west for westerners and everyone else be damned. It is clearly not the best work of any or all the actors/actresses involved, but Rancho Deluxe is still worth a view...not a buy.
