Adam Sandler/George Simmons is going to die, so what does a famous actor to do? Go back to his roots and realize the world has passed him by. Sure, he gets the ladies, a large house, and a ton of money/great stuff, but he lost his love to his selfishness, and he has no real friends. Enter Seth Rogen, a struggling comedian who's simply not funny, and happens to be in the right place at the right time to be Simmons's right hand man/joke writer. That's only the first half hour, and trust me, it only gets more tedious and unwelcome after that.It's always a bad idea to set an expectation in a movie title, and 'Funny People' burns in this regard. There's a lot of comedy, but there's very little funny. In fact, when Eminem & Ray Romano provide what is probably the film's funniest moment (James Taylor comes a close second), you have a serious problem. I tend to surround myself with a lot of stand-up comedy, and in studying the comics of today I get a general idea of what works and what doesn't. Guess what, Funny People's comedy doesn't work. Whether it's cameos, Jonah Hill, Adam Sandler, or Seth Rogen, they all come off very awkward and not funny, at all. Another very awkward/uncalled for scene is the one you may have seen in the ads with Sandler brutally roasting a European guy. As someone who also makes some pretty racy jokes, even I found this scene squeamishly uncomfortable.At one point, Sandler chides Rogen's character for using too many d**k jokes because it guarantees chicks won't sleep with you. Apatow should have taken this advice because 95% of the jokes in this movie are about the d**k, and when he's going for this striking personal drama about Sandler stricken with cancer, all emotion is lost with these jokes. It's just uncalled for, and sort of kills the momentum & the movie. No I'm not prudish, I just don't think it works in this context.This brings us to the drama/story. I learned two things from this movie. Everybody in Hollywood is a large a-hole because they let the fame go to their head, or you'll become an a-hole because you want the fame. Make no mistake about it, at some point in this film every character is an a-hole. This not only turns you off from liking the characters, but I found myself cringing or shaking my head several times in this movie because they're just so dumb, or such a-holes. Again, it's awkward. Sandler's character alone starts off an a-hole, gets better, becomes a large a-hole, then comes back down again.Casting is a rather mixed bag. Adam Sandler gives his 2nd best performance (his scene as an old man in 'Click' still wins me over), and the role is almost perfect for him. Sandler's done a lot of stupid movies like the character, and he knows comedy, drama, and being an a-hole. Rogen on the other hand was awful in his stand-up persona, then balanced throughout the film between being a jerk and being the voice of reason for George. In the end, Rogen couldn't win me over to like his character. I personally thought Leslie Mann's best scene was when Sandler went down on her. Besides that, it's always a mistake for the director to cast his wife, and by the time the character shows up in the movie it had already worn out it's welcome, and she helps run it into the ground. Jason Schwartzman also gives a good performance as a jerk, and Jonah Hill is just underused. Eric Bana? Could've done without him.After leaving the theater, I was deeply depressed & conflicted over the movie, then as soon as I looked at my iPod my mind sprang to John Mayer's "In Repair." Listening to this song was really the missing piece for me since it describes George Simmons. He's in repair at the end of the film, he's not together but he's getting there. It certainly works better than a b-side John Lennon track. Still, with the exception of a few moments in the film & the last five minutes, I found little I liked about the film & it still left me rather depressed.If anything 'Funny People' is proof for me that Judd Apatow is purely lightning in a bottle. It worked in '40-year old virgin,' and to a lesser extent 'Knocked Up,' but aside from these, and displayed prominently in this movie Apatow's is a good producer, a hit & miss writer, and an atrocious director. It's painfully obvious Apatow fully expected the drama and comedy elements to mesh together, but they never did thanks in part to a barage of d**k jokes and as a result I was wanting to leave the theater over 40 minutes before the film ended. 'Funny People' is just too moody/messy to recommend.

Note To Andrew Adamson: You Screwed Up.First off, I really liked the first movie, it was a blend of fun, adventure and family fun with spiritual values that weren't muted by Hollywood. However, the first one was so good, it would be very hard to top it. It's possible, but not likely. And let me also say, that in this case, I don't like it when I'm right.The opening sequence, rather than the Blitz of the first film, we are thrown into the Prince running away for some reason, on the advice of his mentor, who strangely looks like a Hogwarts professor reject. Five minutes later, I'm already bored. Then we are introduced to the kids from the first movie, whose last name I will not even try to pronounce. Things are noticeably different for them. Susan has taken to lying in order to brush pompous boys off her shoulder, and Peter has taken to fighting with anybody that gives him the slightest bit of cause to do so. Why the personality changes? They long for Narnia, and are growing impatient, after all it has been a year. Then just like that, Narnia appears not in a wardrobe, but in a train station.When they get to Narnia, things are also different, there's ruins, and some creatures don't talk, and most of the rest are restless to say the least. The dwarfs for example are utterly useless and annoying, and I was actually rooting for them to be expended by the end. You know, these are the creatures who were reduced to working for the witch in the last movie? Which they say they would gladly do again.The children eventually join forces with the Spanish Prince, and decide to get the prince back his throne, using lots of useless violence. First they storm a castle, which doesn't end well. Mostly due to Caspian, who also becomes quickly unlikable. And his character only gets worse, climaxing in a scene where the dwarfs summon demons and other scary stuff that force Caspian use his blood to bring back the witch from the last movie. And this is a family movie?Note to Andrew Adamson: What in the heck were you thinking here?Then there's a swordfight with Peter and the evil king, who is eventually defeated, only to be quickly replaced by a worse guy, who is quickly defeated in an almost cameo by Aslan. What the deal there? The Lion doesn't appear till the end of the movie, and his part is so minor that it could have been easily rewritten for another character to save the day? Then the movie ends.Many words on the ending: Again, utterly pointless and forced. Why exactly are the children so willing to go back to "earth?" I mean, they were so mad at the beginning about not being there, then they get no leisure while they are there, and are confronted with nothing but trouble, and they're so willing to leave. They're basically like, 'Yeah, that's nice, ready to go back now, see you later, take care.' And then Peter and Susan aren't coming back? And I totally missed the point there. They've learned everything they can learn? If anything, Lucy and Edmund learned more, while the older ones kept screwing up.Note to Andrew Adamson: What the heck were you thinking?Then there's the kiss. What's the point of that, exactly? Did some movie exec say, 'Where's the kiss? We can't have a cute boy and girl without sexual-tension!' Again, like the rest of the movie, forced and pointless. They kiss, and they'll never see each other again, even though they didn't really care that much about each other in the first place.Now, don't think I didn't like the movie... well, never mind, I didn't. But there was some good points... There was Lucy! And there was the cute Badger, who had no role! And how could we forget the mouse? The cute mouse that your love for just boils over everytime you see it, except for its last scene.Wait, I forgot one last thing. When I really thought 'what the heck' during the actual movie, instead of thinking about it while trying to sleep after I got back home from the theatre, was when the trees came alive and started "fighting" the enemy. If that isn't the most lazy steal from The Lord of The Rings ever, I don't know what is. And that was actually one of the better parts in the whole series.Note To Andrew Adamson: What the heck?Overall, while your little children will like most of the movie, mostly thinking about the mouse, you will cringe thinking about the movie afterwards on almost every aspect. In fact, you'll think, why did I even pay to go and see the movie? But, if you take it for what it is, you'll like it better. My major problems with the movie was mostly the bad writing. Bad characters, bad scenes, bad story, and terrible ending.Hopefully, if there is a third one (and Disney will think twice before going any farther on the third one), it will be better, as it is being helmed by fresh eyes. It will still lack half of the main cast, but hey, at least I'll have zero expectations for it. And when you have no expectations, you can't easily be disappointed.

Being a fan of the series since I was a kid, Get Smart the movie was a must-see for my summer movie list, but surely it couldn't be that good, right? Wrong, the movie works in almost every aspect, from the pitch-perfect casting, great characterization, and even the interesting story. Add in comedy that kept me laughing from start to finish, and I left the theater quite pleased.Since then, I've seen this film about 3 or 4 more times, and each time is as good, if not better than the first. An entertaining movie in the truest sense of the word, and it's comic action at its best. Get Smart doesn't miss it by that much, but would you believe it hits it right on the head? Believe it... Now when's that sequel coming out?

I'll admit it, it took me nine years to get to this film. It couldn't possibly exceed the hype. There was just so much critical love for this film that it couldn't possibly deserve it. Yet, after the movie had ended for my first viewing, I was left with the words, "Holy crap, that was pretty good." My mind was blown at the ending, and after this mind-frak of a film, I left to meditate on it. Then I watched it again after a month, and I stuck with my original opinion that this is in fact, a really good and original thriller. Is it perfect? No, but it's still quite the classic and a must-see for everybody, at least once.If there's one reason to watch this movie, it's in the way it's presented. It starts at the end, starts at the beginning, and alternates between the two until they meet in the middle, to which the movie is wrapped up. It works for the story, and keeps the viewers on their toes in keeping track of everything. Let me illustrate to you the brilliance in this presentation. There's a scene where Carrie-Ann Moss comes up to Guy Pearce in her house, bleeding and bruised. She tells Guy Pearce that it was her boyfriend did it to her and that Guy needs to get rid of one of his associates. Seems harmless enough, right? Right, but you just watched the scene without context. Then it moves to the scene that led up to the previous scene. Carrie-Ann Moss comes into a room, Carrie-Ann Moss tells Guy that she's going to use him & proceeds to go on a obscenity-laced tirade directed towards Guy. Only problem is that Guy will never remember this conversation in a minute because he can't write down that Carrie-Ann Moss is actually bad. Guy then hits her, causing her to bleed, so Carrie-Ann Moss walks out the door. She sits in her car for a minute, and then Guy forgets everything that just happened to him, and Carrie-Ann Moss walks through the door as seen in the scene previously, or afterwords. It's more or less brilliant and Nolan uses it to his advantage to spice up an already great story.If there's on fact the movie wants to get across to you, it's that this short-term memory loss makes your life a living hell. The movie goes deep into the detail of how somebody with this condition would live. What are the downsides, what is their life like? Does the ending take things a little bit too far, in basically revealing that half of what the movie told you was a basically a lie? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But hey, the reveal speech by Joe Pantoliano and Guy Pearce is great. And again, it's a 'Holy Crap' moment that will leave you satisfied on your first viewing. Did I get the same feeling the second time around? No. Since I was diverted thinking about the mystery of it all, I started thinking about the more logical points of the movies and the detail. In this sense, the movie didn't hold up for me the second time around. Plus, I must ask, is Carrie-Ann Moss' character really necessary? I mean, besides the scenes that I mentioned above, was she really essential to the movie, or was she just a diversion, or just another person to manipulate Guy Pearce after Joe Pantoliano is gone?Overall, I would highly recommend seeing Memento once. Any more than that is risky. Sure, it's brilliant, but some of the magic from the first viewing was lost on the second, as least for me. Still a classic, I really hope I never get that short-term memory loss.

Upon searching through the long and windy halls of Netflix Watch Instantly one day, I came across this film with a premise that intrigued me. Two hours and five minutes later, speechless throughout most of the movie, I decided that it was not only one of the best dramas I had ever seen, but one of the best films I'd ever seen. Truly, The Legend is a 1900 is one of the most beautiful and moving films in modern film history, an overlooked classic, and a tribute to the Piano in every sense of the word.Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon 1900 was found orphaned, most likely born to and forgotten by immigrant parents, aboard the Virginian a luxury steamliner much like the Titanic, by a steam room worker. He took in the child as his own and named him Danny Boodmann (After himself) T.D. Lemon (After the advertisement on the box he was found in) 1900 (After the year he was found in). He is a man without a birthday, he is a man without a country, he is a man born to The Virginian. 1900 proceeds to live out his childhood in the ship, learning about the world and the languages of the passengers until one day, the crew discovers he's a piano virtuoso, and soon after that, he becomes part of the ships orchestra, as word of his talent is spread by anybody that has ever heard him. Occasionally, the film also flashes forward to around 1945, where The Virginian is being prepped to be scrapped after World War 2, but with 1900 still aboard, and his friend Max's efforts to get him off.Being the only English-language film of the Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore, the film is incredibly beautiful to look at. The striking beauty of the ship is one of the most stunning aspects, choosing to accent backdrops and provide a unique setting for the proceedings. The cinematography of the film is so well-done, as is with the rest of the film, I'm very disappointed that this was Tornatore's only English work, since his use of the language of the film is also very well done, considering most of the crew, including the screenwriters I believe, were Italian. But not only is the film striking as a whole, there's just so many memorable scenes in here that are simply brilliant in the way they are composed and played out. And what do all but two of these 7 or 8 scenes that stick out in my mind have in common? All of them involve the piano. I'm not a big fan of classical music by any means, but the instrumental works, and the way they're shown on screen is unequivocally magnificent. Composed mostly by Ennio Morricone, this is truly one of the aspects that makes the film stand out for me.Tim Roth leads out the cast played by relative unknowns to my mind, and he gives the performance of a career. After watching this film, I came out with a great deal of respect for Roth as he displayed acting talent I didn't even know he was capable of. He sells every aspect of 1900 perfectly. Whether it's the humorous side of the character, the quite side, the peaceful side, the cursing side, the romantic side, or the speech-making side, Roth makes you invested in the character, as if the character development in the movie weren't enough. I don't know if Roth actually learned to play the piano for this movie, but he sold me on that too. Pruitt Taylor Vince also plays the character of Max well, and even though he isn't asked to do all that much, he did a fine job portraying his lifelong friendship with 1900.I don't want to use the word "beautiful" too much in this review, but it aptly describes this movie. Some have called it epic, but it's only epic in its emotions. This movie will valiantly attempt to bring tears to your eyes, laughter, and everything in between. There's a particular scene where 1900 comes to accept his fate the only way he knows how, by playing the piano. But in this scene, there is no piano to play, so he plays air piano. But instead of cheesy, it's touching. There's no words needed to tell the audience the gravity of this scene and this moment, but you feel it. And that's what a movie should do. It should make you feel. It's only a couple hours long, but those couple of hours were all that I needed to be turned into an emotional wreak.

After their silently mediocre major label debut, Snow Patrol was still an obscure band. Thus, "Eyes Open" is highly pleasing, pleasant, and radio friendly. But that doesn't mean it isn't good. The highlight "Chasing Cars" is a highly radio friendly pop love song to the utmost, but it carries a moving quality of originality and emotion. And it must have carried one heckuva sense of mass-appeal, since it still seems to be played at AC stations across America every hour, on the hour.But coming in a close second is "Open Your Eyes," a song that builds slowly, driving home the magnificent chorus in epic fashion, without coming off cheesy. It also would have made for an awesome closer to the album, instead of the dreary "Finish Line." In terms of lowlights, "You Could Be Happy" sounds more of lullaby, and is sure to put you to sleep with its sappy lyrics.But not all is a snooze fest, as the album primarily unleashes the band's rock side. Songs like "You're All I Have," "It's Beginning To Get To Me," "Shut Your Eyes" and especially "Hands Open." All achieve their goals, and all and well-made, well-produced, and keep you interested in the album. Other songs like "Set Fire To the Third Bar," "Make This Go On Forever," wind up as mixed bags, achieving goals in some areas, and missing them in areas, and leaving a general sense of, "I don't know what to make of that." The album lyrically holds onto the strange theme of 'eyes,' with half the songs mentioning the important body part in some metaphorical way, or in a literal sense, depending on what you make of it.Overall, Snow Patrol crafts a very good album, but there are a few critical flaws that keep it from becoming great. But make no mistake, it's not very original, although it's the band's most original, it's radio friendly, but highly pleasant. It also shows brief flashes of brilliance, making this the album I would most likely buy from Snow Patrol's now-vast catalog. They've certainly come a long way from their former days as "Polar Bear."

For American audiences, McFly is like Hanson, except actually good, and they might even have mixes of the Jonas Brothers, except, McFly is actually great. With a penchant for covers, a world-wide cult following, and an implied motto of 'Fun first,' it's a crime that the States don't know this band. "Motion In The Ocean" is probably best introduction to the band, as it is the most unabashedly fun effort to date. Of course, with a song like "Transylvania," complete with organs and Dracula background vocals, how could you take yourselves seriously?"We Are The Young," "Star Girl," "Please Please," "Sorry's Not Good Enough," and "Friday Night" are all full of energy and youthful fun and excitement, capturing what very few American bands have bottled. Sure, it may not be the most original, but this album has only one goal in mind: have a good time. And in this sense, the album is a smashing success. The album also owes a lot to its song-writers, as they perfect the formula, and the producer for making it all sound amazing. Even when the band slows it down with a piano such as, "Bubble Wrap," "Lonely," and "Walk In The Sun" the band pines old themes in a simple, but effective manner, with some surprising emotion involved. "Little Johanna" also foreshadows a sound that groups like Panic at the Disco would take even farther, in a sound that builds in a very strange sunny feeling pioneered by The Beatles. It's so good, it's amazing nobody thought of it before.But in a question of a highlight, "Home Is Where The Heart Is" wins my vote, as it invokes a sound totally different from the rest of the album, but Bon Jovi himself would be right at home in singing, hearkening back to his classic rock works of the 80s. It again is surprisingly simple, but surprisingly effective and good. And again, the writing and production values are amazing. And if you happened to get the bonus track, a cover of Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," you again won't be disappointed. The band really seems incapable of disappointment on this album. "Silence Is A Scary Sound" is a also a worthy tune.Personally, it's one of my favourite albums of all time, and I haven't got tired of it yet. It's just the type that's so catchy and fun, you just want to share it with the world. So please do so, and feel the "Motion In The Ocean," because a wave of fun is sure to crash over you.

What if The Matrix's Neo was not born with his abilities, but rather acquired them after killing some 125 versions of himself in parallel universes? In in overly simple statement, that's the basic premise of the movie. Kill one version of you dies, that makes the remaining versions stronger. You can dodge bullets, become ultra smart, ultra strong... basically like Neo. Kill all the other versions and the universe either explodes, or you become god. So is THE One's plan until he meets his last version, and since both THE One and The One are both on equal power, this One might be a bit harder to kill. If you're not confused yet, then by all means buy the movie.For the action/sci-fi fan, there's plenty of entertainment to behold, and much to sink your teeth in. From the original premise, to fight sequences to the general action, there's certainly enough to keep you going, and the movie succeeds where it should fail. Add a young Jason Statham, and you got a great popcorn flick. Sure, there's a plothole or two, it'll inevitibly be compared to The Matrix, and you'll be perplexed and confused throughout half the movie, but it could have done a lot worse. Get for a rental, check it out on cable, you'll be entertained.

Wyatt Earp is Kevin Costner's bio-pic answer to the film he was originally supposed to star in, Tombstone. It is said that Wyatt Earp is more documentary-like than Hollywood movie. However, at the end of the day, Wyatt Earp fails to entertain or keep the interest of its audience for it ridiculous 3-hour running time.First off, I have to commend the film for its use of Michael Madsen, Linden Ashby & Mark Harmon in particular. All three actor, while playing smaller roles, all to very well with what they have, putting up some solid performances. The cast is littered with recognizable names, and for the most part, everybody does the best with what they got. Actors like Jeff Fahey are underused, but they're usually still solid. The same can not be said for the main characters, however. Kevin Costner is for better and for worse Kevin Costner, not really doing anything with the character apart from what's on the page, often giving a distractingly tonal difference between the two sides of Wyatt Earp. Gene Hackman phones in a performance that asks little of him than to be wise. And even though he's in the movie a grand total of five minutes, he gets 2nd or 3rd billing. As for Dennis Quaid, he gives one of the most overwrought accents in recent memory with his portrayal of Doc Holiday. Sounding like a cross between the Rooster from the Looney Tunes & Colonel Sanders, Doc Holiday is a black hole of personality thats defining characteristic seems to be his only friendship with Wyatt Earp because he has TB. On his own, Quaid's Doc Holiday isn't that interesting, but compared to Val Kilmer's classic portrayal of Holiday, there isn't even a contest. Kilmer wins by sheer default.Then there's how to film views women. Every one of the various wives in this film is portrayed as little more than a winy shrew that will steal a gun and fire it at their man if they're the least bit angry. And they happen to be angry a lot. They get mad when Wyatt moves the family asking why 'the brothers need to stick together.' They get mad when Wyatt does what Wyatt does with the "Cowboy" gang. One gets mad when her husband is cheating on her even though they're not technically married. Not to mention the sheer lack of any personality found in Wyatt's other two girlfriends/lovers/wives to begin with.Then there's the long, drawn-out story. Covering most of the highlights in Earp's life up until Tombstone, the movie has a certain fondness for dropping you in the middle of a situation where nobody seems very happy. They literally jump in time where things are supposed to be better, only to show you that things are not going better. For example, when Earp announces he's moving the family to Tombstone, literally the next scene is the wives complaining that they were moved to Tombstone and thing are the same as they always were, to which one of the brother's respond, "It's not for lack of trying!" Wait, how did you get here again? The movie has a fondness for doing this, leaving very little connection from scene to scene. You're left extremely confused about Earp before & after the Tombstone incident. Why is everybody mad at the guy? Why did he "pick" the fight anyways? In fact, general lack of cohesion makes this movie an overall frustrating watch.Overall, with shoddy stunts, writing, story, motive, main characters, and other problems with most everything else, Wyatt Earp is a forgettable mess that's not the epic the movie is advertised as, unless they meant epically bad and uninteresting. As a stand-alone film, it doesn't work. When compared to Tombstone, it's wiped off the floor in almost every respect.

Let's admit it, the only reason the Terminator franchise was good was because of James Cameron, once he left, it was a crapshoot at best, with most of the proceeding Terminator-related material being crap. Take Arnold out of it, and let's face it, you better have one heckuva great storyline & great characters. This show, unfortunately did not turn out this. Always miscast, Lena Hedley & Thomas Dekker bring a brooding whinyness to the series, with a distinct feel of emo. Sure, Summer Glau elevates the show, but she can only do so much. For the first season, I started out engaged, but as soon as I watched an episode back, I realized it was the drek that it was. Of course, by the time I realized this, I was already 8 episodes in, and it was too late to turn back. Going into the second year, it only got worse. I kept waiting for plotlines to go places, but they'd lose my attention before continuing it once more. I'd wait for action, but what there was, was disappointing at best. Make no mistake about it, TSCC is a sci-fi drama, but the drama is uninteresting & undramatic, and painfully bad at worst.Maybe I didn't get it, and maybe I'm not emo enough to put up with the brooding and emoness, but Fox made the right decision here in not renewing it for a 3rd season. I'm sure all would have been fine once the storylines, and the show got where it wanted to go, but I imagine in the end we'd all be left wondering why we wasted so many precious hours. A cancellation Fox actually got right, who would have thought. Don't listen to the fanboys, this is not worth your time, because this show terminated so many hours of my life.Only Summer Glau elevates this above one star.

When I first heard the song "Back To You" I fell in love. I loved everything about the song, the lyrics, the message, the singer, the melody, I give the song five stars. However when I heard the rest of the album, my interest in the band fell apart.Disclaimer: I'm not a hard rock fan.Since I don't like hard, or grunge rock, I didn't like the album. I thought all of the songs except for "Back To You", were only OK, nothing to write home about, nothing original or outstanding. Just OK. Nothing wrong with OK, but hey, it isn't five-star either. So get "Back To You", skip the rest of the album, and save yourself 45 minutes, and ten bucks.

The Office was one of the seminal comedies of the decade. Starting off slow with an underrated 1st season, then coming into its own and hitting its peak of creativity in the 2nd season. But since then, the quality of the comedy & the storylines have started to degrade. First it started off slow, each season progressively getting worse than the last, until this season. It actually quite fine for the first half of the season, coming up with one of its best episodes with some of its best moments yet (Niagara), but as soon as the show came back from Christmas break, it fell head-first off a cliff.Episode Highlights Include:NiagaraThe LoverMurderThe DeliveryWhat happens in the 2nd half of the season? Well, Sabre happens. It did give us the sometimes funny character of Gabe, and it did start well-enough with a Christian Slater cameo, but those were the only good/memorable parts about it. Granted, I wasn't any fan of Kathy Bates to begin with, but she is simply annoying and underused here. The writers simply don't know what to do with her, and Kathy Bates can't bring anything new to a poorly-written character. Every moment of Kathy Bates on screen is a moment you will want back because it will be unfunny & utterly wasted in the worst way possible. Every move she makes. Every thing she says. Just, simply awful.Granted, I understand why the writers did it, because they felt like the economy has to have an impact on our favorite company in Dunder-Mifflin. Just think about it for a second. They killed off Dunder-Mifflin. I have a great T-shirt that advertises my love of the show with the Dunder-Mifflin logo. And they're just going to kill it off because of the economy? There were probably ways in which to make this story to work, but the writers choose NONE of them.Then there's the characters. Oh, how I just want to slap every writer for this travesty. The writers have always struggled with Michael Scott. Sometimes he's a playful man-child who's immature, sometimes he's the serious boss not afraid to get onto his employees, or actually show why he's in the job, or that he has actual salesmanship. However, the writers stick with the immature Michael for much of the season, and it's getting to the point where enough is enough. The man is becoming a parody of himself. He still goes for the damaged women, and he still proceeds to screw it up with every one of them, then has an affair with a married woman. Just please, stop. The only episode where Michael even resembles his old self is one that Steve Carell directed himself. The case is the same for Dwight. Dwight works in a very specific box. Taken too far, it's an insane jerk. This is the mode he spends most of the season in. Dwight has always been a character best suited for being the receiving end of a joke, since the guy needs to be taken down a peg every once in a while. Of course, there are one, maybe two, possibly three moments of this the whole season. So frustrating!As for the highlights, Jim & Pam are still as great as ever, if a bit underused. Also, Erin comes into her own as a character. She's given a wacky backstory, she's given a nice relationship with Andy, and she's just great with everything she does. She's like the opposite of Kathy Bates. Every scene that Erin is in is made better by her presence. Her personality just radiates sunshine and goodness.Overall, as a die-hard Office fan, this season was frustrating with brief glimpses of goodness. The well has been run dry, the ideas are stale, the characters are in a rut. Oh sweet release, I now pray for a graceful ending to the show. Of course, looking back on Niagara, I would actually be really satisfied with that as a series finale. But since the series will go on for at least a year and a half after that, it will just be the ending in my mind. Steve Carell and the rest of the cast simply don't need to be subjected to this anymore. It's time to move on.

Coming into this documentary, I knew of Wayne Gretzky and knew that he was great, but I didn't know of his story. Heck, I wasn't even a hockey fan, so imagine my surprise when I was glued to my seat during the story of one of the most compelling trades in sports history. Director Peter Burg just does a great job of using old footage mixed with various commentary including that of Gretzky's, and to my surprise again, Gretzky was quite open on his feelings about the trade now. Openly saying you could've had at least two more championships if you hadn't taken the trade? That takes guts.The documentary was also very compelling on the side of reaction, and the management's end of the trade. The documentary was fair on all sides, and I still came away (knowing nothing of the events beforehand, mind you) thinking Pocklington was an idiot. And then I found the reaction from the city of Edmonton just stunning. It's very rare you see a city hold so much of a place in their heart for one guy, then simply riot against the guy who let him go. I mean, they burnt statues of Pocklington in the parking lot.Overall, if you're a hockey fan, a fan of Gretzky, or just a sports fan in general, then you should find much love in your heart for "King's Ransom." It gave me insight into a subject I knew nothing about, and it was well-done and compelling in the process. So props to Peter Burg, and forever props to the great Wayne Gretzky.

Taken on its own, Drillbit Taylor is a film that's too grounded in reality to be that funny. Considering the pedigree involved in writing the project, add the phrase "Exceedingly disappointing" to it also. You see, John Hughes came up with the story, and Seth Rogan co-wrote the screenplay. No, this isn't an Ethan Cohen vs. Etan Cohen situation here, these are the John Hughes & Seth Rogan that you know and love. So how did this film go so wrong?First off, the story. The plot revolves around three bullied kids hiring a bodyguard to protect them, except the bodyguard is actually a homeless person, and doesn't really have any credentials to be bodyguarding. Sound familiar? It should. The plot derives cliches from every bully plot or sub-plot in movie history, every character pretending who they're not, then being found out plot or sub-plot you've ever seen, and a myriad of other random high school cliches. And since the script was co-written by Seth Rogan, who also did Superbad, you can derive a dozen similarities to that movie as well. In fact, in that respect, Drillbit Taylor seems like the prequel to Superbad. There's the tall, geeky kid that has trouble with the ladies. There's his smart-mouthed friend, who also happens to be chubby. And they even have their third member, who isn't really a core member, but can be helpful/crazy when you need him to be. But Michael Cera, Jonah Hill & Christopher Mintz-Plasse these kids aren't. They're bad actors, and they sell little if anything about their characters. The adults are good actors, but with the exception of Owen Wilson and maybe Danny McBride, everybody is reduced to little more than cartoon characters. In one scene, the bully charms all the parents and the school principal with a stupid joke and a smile, and everybody acts like he was Jesus Christ. Granted, this fits into the cliche in these films that adults are stupid and you must take it upon yourself to stand up for yourself, but that's Home Alone logic. And at least in that film, the adults weren't total buffoons.But that being said, the highlight of the film, and the only real reason you should think about watching this film is Owen Wilson. Wilson brings a certain charm to the character and makes the most out of a poorly-written character that's story-arch is a little bit non-existent. Wilson's character starts off as a greedy jerk, then turns into a nice guy, with the implication of one scene being the only explained reason. Then there's the fact that Drillbit can't really fight, then turns into a kicking bad-ass in the one ending scene that makes of the film's DVD cover.Which brings me to this: The film isn't that funny. There's some gags that work, and the charms of a few of the actors make jokes more funny than they really are, but there simply isn't much here to laugh at. This is mainly due to the fact that there's little place for true humor in the story. Why? Because the bully is an unrelenting and dangerous psychopath that threatens people and commits bodily harm to them with a freakin' samurai sword. Thus, the confrontational scenes are utterly brutal to watch. It's like watching a mouse crawling into a lion's cage. You admire its perseverance, but you known that the Lion has the ability and the desire to shred such a cute thing. It's not funny, it's just uncomfortable and scary. The story tries to add humor around these situations, but every one of them falls flat. Especially the ones that involve topics such as balls. Oh, and if you've ever had past experience, or have been traumatized by a bully, you'll be traumatized by watching this film. I felt traumatized and I haven't even been in that situation.Overall, if you're a HUGE Owen Wilson fan, then check out this movie, and you'll find something you like. Otherwise, skip it like it's a fat girl at the prom dance. There's not much to like, there's not much to think about, there's not that much to laugh at, and in the end, you just feel bad.

Being a big fan of Franz Ferdinand's first piece of work, especially the classic "Take Me Out," I checked out their follow-up album to see if they could avoid the sophomore slump and provide us some more rock anthems. This album has a problem though in the lack of variety. Either their sound doesn't permit a great deal of variety, or the vocals don't permit it. Either way, it's a very monotonous record.In fact, the first track is the best track, and it's the best gauge to see if you're going to like the rest of the album, because if you love the song, then you can stand listening to the whole album in one sitting. Otherwise, you're out of luck. Not to say it's a bad album, it just could have used more depth to it. So, hardcore fans unite, everybody else find other means.Real Score: 2.5

Before entering Star Trek, you should know that you might find more of a character-driven drama rather than your typical summer action flick. Sure, there's special effects and action, but it's one of the more uninteresting elements of the movie, but then again, the movie doesn't really need it as J.J. Abrams aims to start anew with the franchise and remind the millions why they fell in love with it in the first place.At first, the movie starts off as a prequel in the traditional sense that it follows how the main characters came to be, and why they come to do what they eventually do. Here, Abrams takes his time to design these familiar characters from the fatherless and rebellious James T. Kirk, to the outcast Spock who is constantly trying to find a place for himself in the universe. Raised by circumstance, driven by a search of destiny, the pair soon find their paths, personalities cross, and clash at Starfleet Academy. Of course, fate eventually lead the duo at odds to find themselves on the christening voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which happens to make a run-in with the exact same villain who had killed Kirk's father some minutes before his birth. Strangely enough, the villain is looking for revenge... What Star Trek villain hasn't wanted that before? Make no mistake about it; Eric Bana would be a wasted one-dimensional character if you could tell it was Eric Bana beneath all that makeup.Of course, the plot doesn't do your mind any favors either because by the end of the movie it's not really a prequel since by the use of time-travel the adventures you've known from the faithful crew never really happened. No Kahn, no whales in San Francisco, no drawn-out scenes of inter-galactic diplomacy. Yet, by the genius of J.J. Abrams none of this really matters while you're watching the movie, mainly because of the likable and relatable characters.The casting is also inspired as Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto come into their own as actors as they give these familiar characters the twists and turns as they make them their own. Even the supporting cast brings new life to relatively limited personalities. Karl Urban who pays tribute to DeForest Kelly in every line he utters as the wisecracking and supportive Dr. McCoy. Zoe Saldana whose character of Uhura is actually given a purpose within in the series, and accentuates the polarizing personalities of Kirk and Spock. May I also mention that the supposed love-triangle in the movie is greatly exaggerated from scenes of flirting.Another key that Star Trek so surprisingly good is the fact that it's directed by a minor Star Trek fan who brings a filmmaker's prospective to the series, and two self-proclaimed Trekkie screenwriters, who also happened to pen the Transformers series. Star Trek is a mix of fandom and good filmmaking that is sure to please both fans and non-fans alike. If anything, the stage is set for a killer sequel.On A Random Note: According to this movie, in the future Iowa not only has canyons, but becomes quite the industrial powerhouse building various starships. Who knew corn country who become such a bustling place in the future?Real Score: 4.5

First there was Elvis, then The Beatles, then The Bee Gees, then R.E.M., then Matchbox 20, now, it's Sufan Stevens. The proceeding was a list of influential and great artists of their time, who did, are, and will leave an impact. To sum this album up, you'll either love it or hate it. To find out, I recommend hearing "Chicago", "Jacksonville", "Come On! Feel The Illinoise!". These are the highlights of the this unique great, classic album.The only track I hated? "John Wayne Gacy Jr.". That's right, a song about a serial killer. Strange? Listen to it. It's the most creepy song in the world. That said, how many people can make a song the elicits such emotions, to that degree? Sufan can.I personally love the album. You might hate it, or you might see the art, or the light in this case. Underrated? Sure. Different? Oh yeah. Art? Grammy worthy. Try it, buy it, love it, hate it, frame it, play it.

Along with winning the award for worst hair, EVER, the 80s were also obsessed with time travel, as it housed some of the stalwarts of the genre (Back to the Future), but in addition to the cinematic classics, were some filmmakers with a creative imagination, but cheesy execution. Stewart Raffill, creator of uber-cheesy E.T. knockoff, "Mac and Me," with the help of producer John Carpenter, takes on the old urban legend and makes a time travel movie out of it. Two sailors from the fated ship fall through a wormhole created by the experiment, and end up in the 80s.The concept and action keep it afloat with some surprising cinematography, and entertaining action sequences dictated by it's chase elements. Of course, the real cheese comes towards the end, with a somewhat forced romance, a little bad acting, and a climax that could have been better. Of course what do you expect with a small budget in the 80s. What you do get is a prime candidate for a remake, and a creative cult classic from the 80s.Real Score: 4.5

Nick Cage is one of my personal favorite movie actors, mostly because he's so darn likeable, and he's been in some darn good movies, and some not so good. He also doesn't like to not work, so he takes most everything on his plate, and does a heck of a lot more than most other actors. This movie however is a departure for him, because it definitely doesn't seem like the movie, or character he'd play. But in the end, he somehow pulls it through, despite a very weak beginning, and a so-so middle. Darn it, I just gave you a review of most of the movie.Story: Around two or three in the morning on TNT a few months ago(isn't that when all the best movies are on?), I watched most of Blade 3. A generally terrible movie had it not had Ryan Reynolds to pick it up with his quirky and humorous personality. Ghost Rider amazingly has numerous similarities to Blade, from the whole supernatural storyline, hero, and yes, devilish villain (pun intended). But overall, there's nothing really interesting or compelling, or for that matter, original about the story. This is probably because the story, except for background info on the characters, is just background.By the way, superhero movies' back-stories have always been the weakest part of the movies. Not many can seem to pull off how they became a superhero, or their childhood story without boring me to death (think Spider-Man 1). This movie is no exception. Yes, it was very important, but could they have speed it up?Acting and Characters: Nicolas Cage of course saves the movie, with his personality, subtle humor, and just plain likability to an unlikable character. Johnny Depp in no way could have pulled off this role without turning it, well, into a dark Blade type movie, as opposed to a light Blade type movie (besides Depp will always being playing some version of Jack Sparrow in my mind.). Eva Mendes, is of course, as the damsel usually is, one of the weakest characters in the movie. She's a bit bland, unrealistic, and at times just does stuff that doesn't make any sense. Ghost Rider's friend (that guy from all those cancelled TV shows?) pulls off his poorly written role off quite nicely, making the character likeable. However, I don't know whether the guy is dead or not, can somebody tell me? Sam Elliot does great in his mysterious role, in which he doesn't do much, except provide a "twist" in the movie.Peter Fonda does a good job playing the devil, which may or may not be a good thing. Wes Bentley is very convincing, but his minions are all clearly failed Sci-fi channel actors. Which is about the worst comment you can get as an actor.The Effects: Nothing really jaw-dropping, or wow moments, or anything like that. No totally amazing action sequences. Instead, the action sequences look very cartoonish, and it seeps into the rest of the movie.Overall, an okay movie. Nothing really amazing, nothing really horrible either. However, Nicolas saves the movie in the corny role of Johnny Blaze, in a pretty corny movie. No Oscars are coming out for this movie. But a few Razzies might pay mind. Of course, coming from the guy that made Dare Devil, I would kind of expect it. This movie wants you to think it's Spider-man quality, but really, it belongs back in the 90's. But I wouldn't be opposed to a sequel.Real Score: 3.5

After loving the first film I saw this terrible sequel. Relizing the potintial of a series I was exited about this movie. Good thing I did not pay money for this! From minute one it was bad, bad cast, bad charectors, bad Bad Guys,and bad story(How many times has mind control been done). Avoid this sequal.

After his excellent debut album Mayer decided to stick with a proven formula, or should I say, the label decided to stick with a proven formula. The result is not Mayer's best effort, and not even close to it. Yet, this guy is so good, it still gets 5 stars.First off, is "Clarity," a soft rock song that's simple musically, but complex lyrically. Supposedly, it's Mayer's first thoughts when waking up one morning. "Bigger Than My Body" makes for sense when combined with the previous track (How much does Mayer weigh times his body? Three times.) The song is a great upbeat song which also continues the theme of "No Such Thing" from the last album, and overall makes for an awesome song."Come Back To Bed" is most evident style change of the many moods of Mayer, it's also the most unexpected, Country Music. That's right, Mayer makes a song that would be a hit on country radio. This version is a little obscure about it, but if you watched/listened to CMT Crossroads with Mayer and Brad Paisley, then you'd wouldn't know what to think. "Home Life" on the other hand is not another country song like you might think, but instead has a funky style all its own. Either way, a surprisingly good song, with good beats."Only Heart" is a good song, except for the fact that it's just a little bit too radio-friendly, and I'm surprised it wasn't a single, however, it probably didn't have the time with the next song. "Daughters" is pretty much what it is, you've probably heard the song, you might think it's sappy, sweet, or just plain weird. Mayer himself isn't a fan of the song, and thought it was too radio-friendly, too poppy. But nope, the record label put it out as a single, which did win Grammy's, but Mayer didn't care. That right there shows what Mayer is made up as an artist. He isn't in it for the money, he's in the game for the music. The song could also be argued as what turns Mayer's style around with his next album.For the highlights, "New Deep" is a great musical number, with lyrics being about searching for that something that's missing, continuing the theme from the previous song. But the chorus really shines here, while the verses are good, they're building up to the impressive chorus that delivers in true Mayer style, with a little pop added in for good measure. But the true highlight of the album is "Something's Missing," one of Mayer's choices for a single rather than "Daughters." With this song, the verses take a backseat to the light but impressive chorus, and the amazing riff and music Mayer plays on his Fender Stratocaster/Telecaster hybrid. As Mayer said, "I want that, and everything related to that."Overall, I would say a tie with his debut. They're both what Mayer calls "Mixtapes" and they both have a distinctive pop sound to them. Although they have their highlights, they're not exactly groundbreaking, or maybe not the most original in the world. That being said, nobody does it better. Mayer is a true talent that would have been considered a god in another time. Let's all embrace his music today, and enjoy the melodies he's created.

If anything, this film is a testament to the acting legend that is Jack Nicholson. The man is only in the film for no more than ten minutes, yet when the movie is over, he's the one you remember. He gave the famous line, he's the biggest "villain," and let's face it, he's Jack Nicholson basically being Jack Nicholson. But hey, we love Jack.But that isn't to say he's the only good part of the movie. Far from it, here the film also catches Tom Cruise in his young prime, a lot of great actors before they became famous, the great writing of Aaron Sorkin in his first work, a solid courtroom drama, and a moral conundrum involving the military. Rob Reiner also arguably gives his best directing performance in certainly his best non-comedic film.But that also isn't to say the film is without its faults. The film sort of drags in spots, and it's guilty of gross-overacting, even though most of the negative overacting is done by Demi Moore, who may also be one of the weaker characters of the film.Still, A Few Good Men is a well-done drama with stupendous acting, solid writing & a good plot. It still holds up, and the price of admission is worth it for Nicholson's courtroom scene alone. It's also interesting to note the sort of questioning of the military code the film dives into, taking into question honor, and the means one goes to protect the nation. For Tom Cruise, this makes the 2nd film that dived into the topic after the excellent "Taps," which was one of Cruise's first film roles.

Picking up where Blink-182 leaves off in the world of pop/punk, New Found Glory was one of the first in the genre to really bring an accessible album to the masses without a 'parental guidance suggested' on the label. They were unapologetic in their style, and they had fun. "Catalyst" was their first with a major label, which of course made them more "radio-friendly." The result is a huge step forward in the genre, and even though they never had a bona-fide radio hit to the caliber of "Yellowcard," it still left an impression.Nowadays, one could define this as the 'NFG sound,' where the music never slows, because the band never wants you to turn down the volume. It's more punk then pop, and it mostly stays this way the whole record. Unfortunately, it gets monotonous after awhile, which is fine if you absolutely love the sound, otherwise, not so much. Also, if you try to remember half the songs and hour later, it's very hard. Maybe it's because they're short, or maybe it's because it blends after awhile. Either way, I wish they'd switched it up a bit every once in awhile.But not all is lost, as the radio single "All Downhill From Here" is still a classic, and it really defines the sound of the album. Then there's arguably the band's best song, "No News is Good News." Why is this one of their best? Because lyrically not only is it totally different then anything the band did or has done, but when did you ever hear Yellowcard, The Starting Line or Blink-182 talk about politics like this? It's blatantly political, but also insanely catchy, and it has some awesome music and guitar work to go with it. If nothing else, it's their most underrated song.Overall, it may not rock the hardest, or win the most Grammy's, and it may not even sound all that great now, but there are some true highlights, and this classic is certainly worth a listen. Sure, you may be laughing at the very idea of calling this a classic, but call me up in 20 years and tell me otherwise.

MWS, or Smitty, has been around forever, or pretty close. However, I wasn't a big fan of his earlier work, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It just seems too old fashioned. Unfortunately after this album he went back to that format. But, after a good 15 years MWS had to change his format, do something different, or at least for part of the album. The result? His best work in my opinion.The first two songs are MWS's best songs of his career. They're different, they're good, one is peppy, one is somberish. (Is that even a word?) It continues through a good first half of the album, then I would say it get boring again, and becomes just like his old work. So did he just use that because he already had it, and he didn't have anything better? Anyways, they're not as good as the first part, and they feel out of place.Overall, a refreshing album from MWS, and his best. And we can only hope he comes out with another one just like it.

I'll admit it, I was never a big fan of the original show. If I remember correctly, they made the point of never killing anybody, so they were forced to live by the merits of crazy plans, and the baddie-of-the-week. Needless to say, unless you were a fan of it as a kid, you don't really have fond memories of the show, and you wouldn't think it'd make a good film, however, under the direction of Joe Carnahan, the concept is taken to its logical extreme, and along the way, awesomeness is given.First off, the casting. Liam Neeson is a myth unto himself now, and the movie plays off of this perfectly. He's a crazy leader, kicking butt, taking names, and making plans. Plus, he just radiates awesomeness. Bradley Cooper is the handsome leading-man type, and that's his character. Granted, by the end of the film he does learn to become a planner, but he's mostly there to look good and crack wise, and I'm fine with that because Cooper does it well. Then there's Rampage Jackson. Since he probably had the hardest role in filling the shoes of a legend, he does pretty well with it. His acting skills are a bit iffy, but he's completely serviceable, he's good for the butt of a joke, and he can kick butt pretty well also. Finally, there's Sharlto Copley, who you may know from District 9. That happened to be his first ever movie role, and he played a largely dramatic part. In his 2nd movie role, he's there for the crazy and the funny. How do I know this? When spinning chopper blades, he sings "You spin me right round baby, like a record baby, right round." That's funny and crazy right? Of course it is! The only problem I had with his character though is his accent. Sometimes he sounds like his native South African, sometimes he sounds Southern. But hey, I still love him. Finally, there's Patrick Wilson as a slimy CIA agent. I had not really seen the guy in anything before this movie, but he is such a good actor, and he seems to be having a lot of fun in relishing the ridiculous role. Trust me, there's a scene with Patrick Wilson in an SUV that's just so brilliant on his part.Next up, plot. This aspect is beside the point mostly, but it's still pretty decent in its own right. You'll have a hard time keeping up with its various "twists and turns," but you'll get the gist of what's happening, and that's what's really important, since it just serves to take you from setpiece to setpiece. Also, this plot does have holes, so don't be surprised if you get Swiss Cheese instead of Cheddar.Finally, the action. This is really the whole point of the movie, and on this aspect, it really delivers. It's original, it's engaging, it's fun, and it's awesome. Among the highlights? The classic scene of the A-Team "flying" a tank, and a cargo ship blowing to smithereens, and it's CGI cargo reigning down. I mean, when the whole point of your movie is to get to the action, you have to deliver, and this movie does just that, and then some.Overall, Stuff blows up. Comedic lines are given. The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. What more do you need? It's like the most recent revival of Star Trek in a way. A tired series is given new life with a great cast that adds their own personality to classic characters, action to be had & a plot to accommodate it all. It may not be the great overall film like Star Trek is, but it knows what it does, and it does it well. And really, that's all I can ask from for a movie like this. I, at least, ate it up.Real Score: 4.5/5

I must admit, this was the first Italian Pop Rock band I've ever heard of, and probably the only music out of Italy I've actually liked. Granted, if you're not a pop rock fan, or the golden staples such as The Starting Line, Yellowcard and such, then you probably won't like this album, because let's face it, don't you hate all good music? Anyways, Vanilla Sky may not be the most original group on the block, but "Waiting For Something" proves that they can at least equal the best of them.Note: Even though the band is Italian, they sing totally in English."Distance" and "Your Words" get the party off rockin' with their catchy and sunshine loaded pop rock hooks, which sink summer glory into everything it touches. "Wasting All Time" keeps the party going before going into an overly vulgar interlude, complete with two F-Bombs. That's the only time they use language on the album, that I can tell, so I begs the question, why the strange interlude? "Unfriend" also offers a surprisingly strong track offering some of the more poignant moments of the album."The Point" offers some great tracks with promising verses, before half-delivering on the chorus. While "Wait For The Sun" offers one of the many punk rock moments on the album, which the band achieves quite well, before delving into one of the few harder moments into the album where it briefly launches into a screamo mode. "Looking For Memories" sounds like a great song, which launches into the band's problem of not knowing half of what they're saying. Sure, they're speaking English, but their accent makes some of the lyrics sort of muffled. Now, this might great to your ears, because the vocals are unlike anything I've ever heard of before. Think Kurt Cobain, except I think without the drugs."70 Miles Away" launches back into the New Found Glory styled pop rock anthems with plenty of catchy hooks that you've probably heard before, but you still like them, so you still love the song. "Broken Car" breaks in the standard acoustic lovesong, which is an absolute must-have for any album like this. As cliched as this sounds of course, with the band's lyrical oddities and comparisons, it doesn't feel like the standard fare. "Never Falling Star" could be the highlight of the album, because all the pieces fall into place. Not only do you have the pop rock catchy hooks, but you have strong verses and an awesome chorus. I could definitely see a band like Yellowcard pulling off a song like this. And in the end, the song all comes together and meshes perfectly.Now, we come to the finale. "The Ghost Track" is by far the hardest track on the record, and it isn't even a hard rock track. It just gets angrier than all the others, and launches into a rather lengthy screamo mode towards the end. I could have done without this track the most. And for those of you lucky to get "Xmas Girl" with their album, you also get a great song. It doesn't feel very Christmasy, but it's pure rockin' pop rock glory with more of a Christmas lyrical theme. While no classic, it's still a great track nevertheless, and fits very well with the rest of the record.Overall, while not the best pop rock album you've ever heard, it does have some great catchy songs that rock your socks off, and the vocals add an indie flavor to the music. A project that's certainly worth checking out from a band that needs to receive much praise from the states. After all, I would say this debut is better than most debuts from all the pop rock standards today.Oh, and for more Vanilla Sky, or even if you're a music fan and you can find it, attain "Have You Ever Seen The Rain?," from their demo project "Play It If You Can't Say It." It's not a cover as far as I know, but if you got a really good producer and two really talented vocalists, this song would blow you away even more than it does here. It's rough around the edges since it's a demo, but its roughness adds to the song all the same. I would say it's by far Vanilla Sky's best work by far.Real Score: 4.5

The hardest thing for an artist to do is release a greatest hits album. Do you pick fan-favorites? Most successful or popular? Best lyrics? Best music? Band's favorite? Nobody will end up totally happy. With this album, I think the band left out most of the fan-favorites. Where's the "Houseplant Song?" How about their magnificent cover of "Free Ride?" Don't tell me they left out "Clap Your Hands?"Most are great selections for the band. But some of the new songs leave something to be desired. "Goodbye" is your standard goodbye song, maybe a little cliched, but hey, it's a goodbye song. And I thought "Blaze Of Glory" was a cover of the Bon Jovi song, where it came from I don't know, it's a cover of some other group I know. Weird addition. And for those of you who got the special edition, "Down In The Lowlands" is an excellent song. Mark Stuart is spotlighted on this song, and boy does he shine.Overall, get the special edition if you're going to get the album. If you have the rest of Audio A's albums, download "Down In The Lowlands." It's a must have for any fan. Thanks Audio A, you'll be missed.The hardest thing for an artist to do is release a greatest hits album. Do you pick fan-favorites? Most successful or popular? Best lyrics? Best music?

By the time I had finally got around to watching this movie, the hype had already cemented itself in my head. 'It's the greatest super hero EVER!', 'It's one of the greatest movies EVER!' Of course, such hype rarely lives up, but I went in wanting to love this movie. While certainly a great uncharted dimension for super hero movies, certain to shape the future of the genre for the foreseeable future (Superman is already to tread the path towards the dark), it does fall short in key places. So first off, my criticisms on why this movie as a whole doesn't live up to the hype. Unfortunately, to fully explore this qualms that seem to solely bother me, I will have to give a spoiler or two.Firstly, the movie strikes a dark and twisted realism that is very well done, giving a certain tone to the film that separates it from others. It's gritty and chilling to say the least. However, with some glaring moments, Nolan leaves some farcical moments in the movie, for me at least, tarnishing the experience, mainly the unrealistically incometent police force. For example: Leaving the Joker with idiotic guard, going into a known death trap under the overpass... the list just goes on. Now of course, the Gothom City police has never been the brightest, but never to this ridiculous extent.Secondly, while it would be inconsistent with the comics, and a few key themes of the movie, I'm just one of those guys that believes in killing the bad guy so he doesn't come back for a sequel, especially in this case. Now, in the 3rd installment if there's even a passing mention of The Joker, or lack of one, you're going to have a massive elephant in the room... because that's right kids, The Joker, terrorist and mass-murderer at large, lives to see another day. Now I might write this off had Ledger not died, but since his unfortunate death, Nolon knew he couldn't bring the character back in any form, so why not just dispense of the character, especially since this presents no inconvenience, since in the last scene, he's on his way down anyhow. Just let him go, and there's no elephant. Also, A Dark Knight would imply some murder to his methods, as is, he's more of a white knight, because he captures and brings to justice.Speaking of the late great Heath Ledger, his performance is not only his best, but worthy of all the hype. If he doesn't win a post-humous Oscar for this role, it would truly be a crime. Ledger not only gives a creepy and psychotic performance that sends chills down your spine, he completely rewrites the book on the character/psychopathic personality. Hannibal Lector almost looks like Santa Clause comparitavely. The rest of the cast is eqally excellent, from Bale to Gyllenhaal, from Caine to Freeman. Aaron Eckhart on the other hand gives a severely underrated performance, as he gives equally spine-chilling scenes... just not to the caliber as Ledger.Just for kicks, I watched the original 1989 "Batman." Comparitevely, the once heralded movie now looks even more of a farce, and an all-out comedy. From tone to acting, to story and everything else, there's no comparison as Nolan has taken Batman from farce to brilliant charactacher. But that doesn't mean this movie is the great, as I would even argue Batman Begins is a little better, and Iron Man still ranks as the greatest super hero movie so far. While putting up excellent performances and quite a few jaw-dropping moments, Dark Knight doesn't follow through, and leaves some rather large elephants in the room. Odds are you'll love this movie, but I'd personally would probably only watch it once.

The Newsboys is a great 90's band, not so much in the new millenium, but in the 90's, the ruled. "Breakfast" is one of the greatest songs of all time, and classic Newsboys. There's so many great songs on here, and they did a great job with the song selection. And there's new tracks, the best of which is "Joy". The song definitely shows the sound of the band in the new millenium. O, did I forget "Mega-Mix"? Great re-mix song that covers most of the songs on the album. It would have been great to see the re-mix album done with expanded mixes herd here, but this is a great addition to the album.Overall, a great greatest hits album, for a great band. They did them well around this time, and even though they didn't have bonus DVD's, I would still recommend getting this. There's a new greatest hits collection coming out this fall, that'll have a DVD, but it won't have the quality of songs found here. They'll leave out some great songs, and they won't have my buy. But this is great.

One of the most influential groups of the 00s, Blink-182 has had their share of haters and criticisms, but they've come back strong every time. This generically titled "Greatest Hits" is pretty standard by greatest hits albums, showcasing most of the singles, maybe a few rarities, but the most distinguishing feature is the exact chronology of the album. As you trek through you see their progression musically, vocally, and even in maturity.Highlights Include:CarouselWhat's My Age Again?Adam's SongThe Rock ShowFirst DateAnother Girl Another PlanetAt the start of the album the band has a distinctive punk sound and as they move on the sound becomes more streamlined and mainstreamed, which culminates in 'Enema,' and branches off in subsequent records. Sure, some of the songs and choices are questionable, but thus is the history of the band. One thing you can't deny, their hits were pretty darn good/fun.The collection is basically a showcase of the band before their breakup and subsequent hiatus. However, since they're back together, I would hold off on the album for fear of them releasing a better version with more rarities, or even an edition which included a DVD. Not to mention the fact that something just seems to be missing from the album. The future of this influential band is now wide-open, and this CD is a reminder where they've been. What's down the line? Nobody really knows...

Let's face it: Dragnet is by no means a good movie. Just look at the ridiculous plot that after all these years, I still can't find the reasoning behind. It's just an excuse to get Tom Hanks & Dan Akyroyd into goat leggings. Still, this is one of Dan Aykroyd's best film roles, and young Tom Hanks is a lot of fun as well. Aykroyd has the perfect voice for the narration, and he does a stupendous job playing the deadpan seriousness and dedication of Joe Friday, while still cracking some classic jokes. Yes, this movie is proof that Dan Akyroyd once had a career, and was once very funny. Tom Hanks is of course Tom Hanks, but still rather funny in that Tom Hanks way, going from not serious, to serious, to funny, to cracking wise. Plus, you have Harry Morgan who everybody loves, and that still catchy theme. Sure, you could have taken out all the crappy 80s-ness of it all, including that god-awful "rap" over the credits, but hey, you pay a price to see a good Aykroyd.Overall, everything relating to the main duo is very good. Everything not relating to them is very bad. Watch it once, watch it twice, just soak in your Aykroyd appropriately, and take just the comedy facts: The only two things that separate humans and animals are our ability to use cutlery, and the ability to resist our primal urges.

How to Train Your Dragon is the latest from the stable of Dreamworks, but apart from the animation style, you'd never know it.How to Train Your Dragon is the story of Hiccup, a Viking who feels out of place since he's not a fan of killing the dragons the Viking's world so revolves around in. But, when Hiccup captures the rare Night Fury Dragon and inadvertently injures it, the two become fast friends and attempt to bridge the gap of understanding between the Dragons & the Vikings. It may not sound like much, but things are deeper than they may seem here, and they are 3 reasons you need to go out and watch this movie right now.1: Casting: Having seen Jay Baruchel as a geeky character in the film Fanboys, this film only solidifies for me the fact that Baruchel makes cliched characters feel real & brings traits out they wouldn't have otherwise, and this fact is very evident here. The same is true for the rest of the cast. In Shrek 2, Larry King was wasted in a long-running and painful transvestite joke. Here, Craig Ferguson is perfect in the role not only because he's Scottish, but he brings the appropriate mix of eccentric leadership needed for the right-hand man of Gerard Butler's character, who is also well cast. The same goes for the rest of the cast with the possible exception of Jonah Hill, who always feels out of place in almost every movie he's in.2: Visual Effects & 3D: Now this may because the Viking environment hasn't been portrayed much on screen before, but the film is stunningly beautiful, and that's only reinforced by the 3D which is used better than Avatar in some cases, especially in the case of the flying sequences.3: The Emotion/Uniqueness of the Film in Animation Today: The story gives way to many emotional moments in the film, all of which are played perfectly. And, not to give too much away, but at the end of the film something happens the to main character that was not only shocking to me, since I'd never seen something of its magnitude done in animation period, but to me it was also one of the most tear-jerking moments, especially in relation to what it does to the relationships & similarities between Hiccup & his dragon in the movie.Overall, how do you train your dragon? With charm, love, understanding, amazing visuals & stunning 3-D flying sequences. This film ranks up there with Pixar's best, and if I had any criticism towards the movie, it would be the fact that it's made by Dreamworks, and with their quality lately, you don't have high expectation entering this film. Nevertheless, How to Train Your Dragon gets a fire-breathing 5 out of 5.

Relient K axed its old image and created a new one, minus a guitarist, plus two, bringing the lineup to five. Gone are the direct mentions of God, opting to design lyrics to mean either God, or a girl, depending on what you figured it. Most of Relient K's core fans saw the move as a sell out and a desertion of the band's roots. Departed are the pop culture references and in with themes of girls, breakups, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Most noticeable though, is the band's shift to more punk and hard rock.This time the highlight is "The Only Thing Worse than Beating a Dead Horse Is Betting on One," a thinking man's song, a lyrical tour de force, a summarization of politics, and a caution toward the future. "Just listen to the politician wishing his position wasn't missing everything his heart would like to say. And the constant in the constitution is that there can't be one solution, it'd be so far from the truth that we would hate it anyway. Opinions are immunity to being told you're wrong; paper, rock, and scissors they all have their pros and cons. And all of us we will endure, just like we always have. But you just can't be too sure how long this will last. Cause we control the chaos, in the back of our minds our problems seem so small. But they grow on us like gravity. But gravity still makes us fall."The only problem with the album is there's little originality; it's been done. That said; Relient K does it better, with construction of songs and substance of messages conveyed. Overall, a stellar rock album that fulfills with its well thought-out finality.

After the utter lostness of Season 2, watching the first 6 or 7 episodes, you'd think you have been caught in a time-warp where Season 2 never died. But don't worry folks, the brutal tediousness of the beginning of the season was not to keep this season down, and in fact, it's provided the show some of its best & most underrated moments in the history of the show. Sure, it may be small pieces in a big puzzle, but almost every minute of the 2nd half of this season is simply enthralling.Highlight Episodes:Flashes Before Your EyesThe Man from TallahasseeExpos&eacute;The Man Behind the CurtainThrough the Looking GlassSeason 3 is all about those mysterious Others, a group with the weirdest sense of motives, or lack thereof ever conceived on television. For the first 6 episodes, you got intimate knowledge of their polar bear cages, and the general complex of the zoological facility, which you would never really see again. But hey, you got a lot of tedious dialogue, a lot of Jack being stupid, Kate being the point in a love triangle/quadrangle. Make no mistake about it, if you did not watch these episodes back to back through the wonders of DVD, I feel sorry for you. It's hard enough dealing with this tediousness over a night, much less months.But again, all is not Lost, because the producers saw the error in their Season 2-type ways, and sought to correct them. We got some Desmond flash-forwarding with one of the most emotional moments the serious produced up until that point. We got some AWESOME Locke dialogue and interactions with Ben Linus, including a lot of Ben Linus vs. John Locke.And then of course, we have Nikki & Paulo. Oh, that infamous duo that was so eloquently summed up by Sawyer as, "Who the hell are you?" Sure, I wanted to slap them every moment they were breathing until they got an episode of their own, but once they did get a flashback episode, one could consider it one of the worst Lost episodes of all time, or one of its worst. There was strippers fighting crime, hilarious flashbacks that tried REALLY hard to show that this duo was there the WHOLE time (What? You didn't see them in the background doing nothing?), and really atrocious dialogue/acting. I mean, they even conceived an excuse for why Paulo was going to the bathroom in almost every previous scene we had seen him in before! But alas, these truly awful, annoying characters were literally buried alive, set to some of the most inappropriate clapping I've ever done. Oh, Nikki & Paulo, how will I ever get by without you? Just fine actually.Heck, the producers actually made Charlie likable again, right before they killed him off. I mean, they tried so hard to make him a jerk last season, and here he is making the top 5 moments of his life, and heck, we actually like him again! What's worse is, we genuinely root for him! Oh, how easy we forget. Sure, Jack & Kate are basically the same as last season, continuing their characters' downward spiral. But hey, Sawyer is as hilarious as ever, Hurley is as lovable as ever, and hey, we finally did away with full-time flashbacks! Oh Lost, how far you came in such a short span of time.Overall, watching this season is one of the most satisfying of the show, especially since you get such plentiful, awesome moments after sitting through so much tediousness at the beginning. Underrated, Season 3 will always have a special place in my heart, if only for the reason that it truly made what Lost became later.

Now, we didn't know it when it came out, but this would be the last Audio A CD of totally new material. And did they go out in style, as the first track quickly shows. "Clap Your Hands" is one of my favorite Audio A songs, a great rocking song that's just plain party fun. It's impossible not to either play air guitar, or dance. If you don't, you don't know how to have fun, because this song it cranked to 11 fun. And while not as good as "Clap Your Hands", the title song is a great rock song."King" is a great Audio A original worship song. Audio A never did a cover to do a great worship song, they created them, and this song is one of their best worship/praise songs. "Undefeated" comes with a little of Deja Vu, as it sounds a lot like the title song."Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher" is the best cover ever done of that song. Mark Stuart shines for good reason on this song, and blows the original out of the water.Overall, Audio A didn't go out doing bad albums, they went out with some of the best work of their career. This is a great band, and they'll be sorely missed by all CCM fans. Let it be said Audio A went out undefeated and in a blaze of glory.

To explain the awesomeness of Zombieland, let me explain to you this one scene. Woody Harrelson locks himself in a booth, and cages himself in. A horde of zombies is circling around this booth. Zombies are climbing on the cages, trying to come through the back door and the roof. Woody Harrelson graps two pistols, and starts blasting them away. When he runs out of that round, in slow motion, he spins around, puts the clips in the pistols and starts again in his seemingly futile effort. In any other movie, he would have died. But this isn't any other movie. This is Zombieland, and it's awesome. When Woody Harrelson emmerges victorious from his caged booth, a whole pile of dead zombies in his wake, you cheer, and you get exited, because you just got a crapton of awesome dumped on you. That's Zombieland, and it does what it does VERY well.What is does suprising well is its characters. Usually the characters are disposable like a blonde having sex in a horror film, but not here. It's still a Zombie movie, but by the end of the film, I felt an emotional attachment to all the characters. I can relate to Columbus. Talahassee, as mentioned before, is awesome. Little Rock is cute. And I'm always a sucker for Emma Stone acting like Emma Stone. Plus, the character interactions are just a joy to watch.The film also works on a story level. Sure, it's simple and basic, but it's well-told and it gets the job done and the characters where they need to go. The action doesn't dissapoint either, whether it's the "action setpieces," or whether it's the simple things of opening to car door while the car is moving to knock the crap out of a Zombie. As the movie says, enjoy the little things. And that's another thing! The rules and their layout in the movie is just so original, and again, fun. I like how it floats next to characters on screen. It's just a great way to present the movie. Did I also mention that it's funny? The often-talked about cameo completely lives up to the hype, and the movie presents comedy gold spliced in-between everything else to.Overall, if you like Zombies, go watch this movie. If you hate Zombies, and want to kill them, go watch this movie. There's certainly a good time to be had by all. I just didn't expect I'd have that fun of a time. But boy, did I ever. So nut up, shut up, and get this movie!

There are two types of people in the world, those who hate Dane Cook and think he is overrated, and those who think Dane Cook is pretty darn funny. I fall more in the latter category. And here he makes his starring debut, and nobody could save this film except for the Kind of Egoism. Well, add to the fact that it has an interesting locale and this film saves itself from a somewhat shallow grave. And comes off rather funny in the process.The Cast: Dane Cook brings his personality to the movie, and hits all the right slacker notes. It definitely couln't, or wouldn't have been pulled off very well any other guy, except one who is truly a slacker. The underrated Dax Shepherd also hits all the right notes as his evil and underhanded cashier superstar. Although it is weird to see him with blond hair, but it makes him all the more evil. And Jessica Simpson, while winning no Oscars, doesn't exactly come away with any Razzies as screamingly as her other roles. She comes off a bit likable, even though her character is a bit one-dimensional.The supporting cast is also rather well done with many underrated talents. Harland Williams, Efren Ramirez and Brian George also do well in what under-used roles they have. And they come off great as always. It's also nice to see Harold Crenshaw, or Tim Bagley in a role that fits him very well. On the other hand, Andy Dick is self-explanatory to his name, and the over-used Danny Woodburn is as annoying as always.Story: Fairly interesting, and entertaining. Sure, it may be one you've heard a million times, but with the added element of the "Super Club" setting, it makes things all the more interesting. It's more of a satire on the blue-collar workshift workers who make their living in dead-end jobs, with nothing to look forward to. And the movie makes this dull existence something of a respectable position. But don't expect me to turn my application in there any time soon. And although this may sound weird, the more poignant moments of the movie were very good (stop laughing, I'm not out of my mind).Comedy: With all these comedic minds, how could there not be a chuckle or two? Fortunately, there's more than chuckles, and it blows into all-out hilarity in spots. Of course, my humor is the more juvenile 'Family Guy' type, but I was very amused during the whole movie. And while all gags featuring Andy Dick fall flatter than a... never mind, Dax Shepherd's victim gags seem to garner a laugh every time. And the competition scenes are sure to grab a few laughs if only because of the sheer ridiculousness of it all.Soundtrack: Props to the soundtrack of the movie, with it's wonderful use of Sugarcult's "Do It Alone," NeedToBreathe's "Shine," the cover of "Surrender," and whatever the name is of that song that plays at the beginning of the credits. It's all fun, it's all good, and it's all used very well. It's very rare that a movie has this much music that I actually know, much less like.Overall, pick it up for a rental, or pick it up in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart, there's enough here to entertain and sustain. Sure, it may not be the greatest film on earth, or even close, but this little comedy does have heart, laughs and a great cast. Or you can just write me off as crazy, which you probably have anyways.

Combing through the movie graveyard on Hulu a couple of months ago, I found Captain America, from the year 1990. That's right kids, after DC & Batman came out with a successful adaption, Marvel decided to put out their top character in movie form as well. The results are sad. Starring J.D. Salinger's song Matt, this film probably deserves to be left in the movie graveyard. But hey, it provided some entertaining Live-Tweets that I made during the course of the film. They will shed light on this film, and they will hopefully entertain more than the movie did.Wow, Billy Mumy grows up to look exactly Darren McGavin. Who knew?Captain America just went into the ladies restroom. There's screaming ladies & this is unintentionally hilarious.Fact: Captain America is useless without a shield, which he mostly uses as a glorified boomerang.Captain America also substitutes a table for a shield fairly easily. In fact, he doesn't like his suit very much either.Red Skull doesn't do much. He has his daughter do most everything.Red Skull doesn't have a red skull either. He got plastic surgery so he just looks like Old Italian White Guy Skull.Fact: Red Skull killed JFK, MLK & RFK. I don't know why Oliver Stone didn't figure that one out.Fact: Captain America likes to do backflips.Yeah, Captain America just saved Eastern Europe by knocking Red Skull off a cliff! Wait, somethings not right there...Captain America just somehow stopped Global Warming. Movie Over!And don't forget kids, now that you've seen this awful movie, go out and support the "Environmental Protection Act of 1990!"

Imagine, this is the movie that discovered Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, being this both of their debut roles. And the acting in this movie shows it, as great performances are given all the way around, especially by Timothy Hutton. What might be even more amazing is that I've never heard of this movie before two weeks ago.In fact, I imagine that today's audiences couldn't sit through the first thirty minutes, as it's mostly filled with dialogue, and seemingly boring military school proceedings. But this is all very important, as it shows you the full load of dynamite just waiting to go off. Then as the movie progresses, it quickly delves into a 'Lord of the Flies' situation where there's youth in revolt. As the drama and tension rises, it soon becomes very clear that despite what you hope for, all will not end well. And when the end finally does come, it's hard to watch, even though it almost seems necessary.The movie is certainly though-provoking, taking on themes of independence, military school, indoctrination, brain washing, honor, duty, dignity, courage, and fighting for what you believe in. They're thoughts that stay with you for awhile, and they offer no real answer, but it will challenge your beliefs.Overall, an underrated and brilliant character masterpiece, with superb acting from some now famous stars, and a story that causes you to think. Granted, it makes me want to stay far away from military schools, and it's hard to watch at times, but "Taps" is a must-see movie.

Maybe it was the reviews, or those horrid ads, but somehow I figured this movie was going to be terrible, and gave it 15 minutes. But against all expectations, not only did I get through the movie, but it was pretty good. Granted, it is a bit formulamatic, predictable, and some of the jokes fell flat, but it succeeded where you'd least expect. In fact, it was sweet, engaging, it did have some great jokes, but also good performances and a soundtrack that anchors it all.It mostly rides on the concept of missing out on your dream by *this* much, leaving you with only a bunch of 'what-ifs.' In this case, it's a rocker who missed his chance on being part of one of the biggest groups in the world. A deleted scene with former-Beatle Pete Best anchors in this fact, and the concept actually is quite interesting in of itself. Add to that themes of moving on, maturity, and following your dreams, and you're hooked.Another thing that is surprising is characterization, as you see this motley crew who make up a band develop and mature through their journey on the road to stardom. Rainn Wilson, Emma Stone and even Christina Applegate are great in their roles, and bring something extra to their characters that probably wouldn't have been there otherwise. Teddy Geiger is also a good actor, playing an emoish kid who through his journey develops into a sunny pop/rock artist. And this is where the soundtrack comes in, because even though it doesn't sound all that great by itself, it sounds pretty impressive within the movie.Overall, you should at least check it out as a rental, and come into the movie with an open mind. You might just like what you hear and see in this underrated flick. Granted, it's not amazing, but it is worth a watch, and your support. Dwight can't stay in his cubicle forever...

What happens the when an aircarft carrier is transported through time, and has a chance to try to stop the attack of Pearl Harbor? That's what "The Final Countdown" ponders in this little known cult-classic, which you may have never seen on TV, but it broke ground for many time travel movies that came after. But it seems the answer is that funless fate will keep time on it's natural course, and you can't really change it, but just adjust it, or at least according to this film. But what the movie lacks in the satisfaction of seeing it's premise play out, it does have is the suspense and engagement in watching the film, heavily thanks to Michael Sheen and Kirk Douglas, two great actors sharing the screen.And although the film doesn't carry with it a great deal of action, it does have the action of the carrier itself, as it seems to me at least, to be a very accurate portrayal of the ship, and it makes for a great backdrop to the movie. So, if you're a former Navy shipsman, or a time travel enthusiast, this movie broke a lot of ground, so check out this surprisingly good early 80s cult classic.

Rolling Stone isn't without its share of problems. Maybe it's because the Internet age has passed them up, or they're just under poor management, but the magazine is far from being top-notch. Every album they've heard will never compare to the oldies like Bruce, Bob and The Stones, and as a result, it's incredibly rare to see an album with more than 4 stars. And frankly, the amateurs at AllMusic.com show them up every single time.Then there's the politics, which the magazine has seemingly moved to in order to boost sales (bad idea; it fails every single time). Instead of bands like Kings of Leon gracing the cover, Obama's smiling face seemingly glows everytime I read the magazine (4 times in total so far). John McCain on the other hand is portrayed as the anti-christ, sure to kill black people, torture gays, and talk meanly to those nice little terrorists. In fact, according to the magazine, anybody even seemingly close to having an "R" next to their name can't be good, and must be disposed of. And those darn Christians, according to Rolling Stone, they'll seemingly be the death of us all, conspiring against us, ready to kill us in our sleep. Obama and the "D"'s on the other hand can never do any wrong, according to Rolling Stone. I mean really, compared to Rolling Stone, The New York Times and Rosie O Donnell are The Bible and Mother Teresa.Of course, you can always try your hardest to ignore all of it, I just wish they'd focus more on music. The movie guy on the other hand seems to have a good shake on things (giving "W." 3.5 stars), and he overall does a good job. But of course, the magazine's strongpoint is the music. The interviews with the artists are insightful, and the news is the best in the industry. Their music commentary is also outstanding, with the music editor routinely making great points on the state of the industry. On news and commentary, every other outlet I've seen doesn't even come close.Overall, if you're a hardcore music fan, and you want the musical insight, news and who's hot and not, there's seemingly still no better source than Rolling Stone. But then again, you have to put up with mediocre music reviews, and blatantly biased and overly magazine-filling political coverage. If you can get the magazine for dirt cheap price, then by all means, buy it. Otherwise, it's totally your choice.To Rolling Stone: I'm always open to a position in contributing to your fine magazine.Real Score: 2.5

What to do with $15 in birthday money? You're at Wal-Mart and you have the choice of Joy Williams' "Genesis" or Big Daddy Weave's "What I Was Made For". You've heard a couple of songs off both albums, and like them. What did I choose? Well, I thought buying Joy Williams would be embarrassing and not "manly" enough, so I said hello to the Big Daddy, and some bubble gum.Big mistake. There's only 3 1/2 songs I like, and one is a Wal-Mart exclusive live song of "Neighborhoods". With that song, I think the Big Daddy should make a live record.The album starts off well, "What I Was Made For" is a great rockin' song, and the band's best. "You're Worthy Of My Praise" is a great modern worship song, and Barlow Girl's best duet (that Selah one was just gosh darn awful). I also like Fred Hammond's part in "Killing Me Again". I think he has great lyrics in his part, and his short part in the track is better than all the tracks I haven't mentioned off this album, combined!That's right, the rest is pretty bad. After a couple of songs, the album becomes VERY formomatic. Other songs are just poorly constructed, and poorly executed. And even after reading the explanation to "The Track Of Silence", I still think it's an excuse to lengthen the album, so it actually seems like you're getting your money's worth. You're not.Overall, another bad formomatic album for the Big Daddy. I would recommend only buying the songs I mentioned off the Wal-Mart MP3 store to get the bonus track. Sorry Big Daddy, try a live record.

Shutter Island is not a film I expected to like. A psychological thriller with touches of horror and jump scares? Boring. And it would be too in the hands of literally anybody else. Instead, we have Scorsese making moods like it's nobody's business & creating atmosphere while still balancing those pesky things called plots and characters. Leo makes good use of the accent and brings some humanity to an otherwise messed up man.Granted, one could only come to this conclusion after the end of the movie since the movie lives or dies by its 3rd act. Personally, I think they did a great job with it. It's unrealistic as all get out, but Scorsese sells you on it, and rest assured if you go back through the movie, it still mostly holds up with the twist. But here's the thing, without the twist, it would be a fairly generic and boring film, even if everything else was the same. The ending and the reveals/twists bring a quiet intensity to the proceedings which lead to some good emotional and dramatic moments, and somehow makes the rest of the film worth it.Overall, if you like a good Scorsese mood piece, then by all means watch this movie. It's not a brilliant movie, and we could debate the warrant of that ending all day long, but in the end, Shutter Island is pretty entertaining.

Disclaimer: I've not heard every song on the album.That said, I don't think I could. It's not like they're a bad band, it's just when they get into the hard rock stuff, I don't care for it too much, such as the title track. Songs like "The Last Night" don't float my boat either.However, "The Older I Get" makes up for most everything else, as it has to be one of the best songs of the year. If you've not heard the song, please do, you'll be doing yourself a favor. I actually first heard it on mainstream radio, but that doesn't make the song any worse, it's just a great song. It's very catchy, and very emotional. Although I personally don't relate to the song's message, I think a lot of others would.Overall, most of the album is suited for the hard rock crowd. Other songs I just don't get. But the one redeeming song saves the day. If you don't get the album, get "The Older I Get" I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Oh, get the mainstream version, because it has better production value than the album version.

From the firs note, you'll be blasted on a punk roller coaster covering some of the most successful and popular songs of all time, giving a much needed break for these songs that are taken far too seriously in their original versions."That Thing You Do" and "Goonies R Good Enough" is typical punk, nothing really special, and not really memorable. But this is quickly erased with songs like "Never Ending Story Theme Song" which is pumped up with so much adrenaline, forget about sleeping for awhile, and it's packed with so much fun, you can't help love this song. "I Don't Want To Miss A Thing" and "The Glory of Love" put a light side into songs that take themselves way too seriously, and that were unduly successful."(Everything I Do) I Do It For You" again appaulingly puts a "classic" in its place, almost making fun of it, rocketing through the chorus that is so vocally Bryan Adams, NFG doesn't even look back, they're too busy going to the next song which is..."My Heart Will Go On" is the second-most successful song ever by a female, being so recognizable, and classic... Not anymore, New Found Glory blaze through the familiar notes, through the spots where Celine showed off her vocals, and in the end, the song is unashamedly ripped apart in almost parody fashion. So fun, so amazing, so punk.That was quick... Overall, though it is amazingly short, they really do some classics justice, and put the originals in their place. This is a pure fun, rockin' punk album that is not for the faint of heart and/or music critics. The world of music will never be the same again.

How does one describe The Core? Think Armageddon meets Journey to the Center of The Earth meets The Happening. Armageddon in that it's about a rag-tag group of people sent to save the Earth by going into an unknown place using experimental technology and using a nuclear explosion to help complete their task. Journey to the Center of The Earth in that it's about people going DEEP under the Earth. We haven't been more than 7 miles deep? Really? The Happening in that some of the actual disaster scenes are similar and it has a very cheesy vibe coming of it. So what are the results? A B-movie action flick that's well-done and quite enjoyable in the process.The plot is about the Core of the Earth which is about to stop rotating, and creating a bunch of weird natural phenomenon in the process. A hole in the O-Zone layer or something melts The Golden Gate Bridge and half of San Francisco, Birds and a trout go haywire and inadvertently attack people, everybody with a pacemaker dies, and Rome is destroyed by static electricity and lightning. Yes, the film ignores science like it was of the Devil, but it's cheesy. It's supposed to be like that. Oh, did I mention the Shuttle landing sequence? Say what you want about this movie, but it has balls.The result is an Armageddon-style trip to the Core of the Earth in an effort to restart it. Things so wrong, people die, people sacrifice themselves to save everybody else, they run into unexpected problems, they split up the ship, and the government isn't as nice as they seem. Sound familiar? Yes, it's clich&eacute;d as all get-out, but it's a fun type of clich&eacute;d. Part of this fun comes from the cast. Aaron Eckhart is likable/decent, Hillary Swank is serviceable, Stanley Tucchi is great, DJ Qualls is DJ Qualls, Delroy Lindo would have been better if he mentioned Sesame Cake, but hey, he's decent too. And last but not least, Bruce Greenwood is awesome as a wise leader/mentor. There's a French guy too, but he's French. You know he's not going to make to the end.Another part of the entertainment is partially brought on by the environment. It's nice to see a spin of the Journey to the Center of the Earth tale. Granted, most of it looks like indistinguishable computer-generated stuff, but it's still serviceably original.Overall, The Core is an appropriately fun and well-done take on familiar elements and story. It's not going to be Earth-stopping (See what I did there?), but it will most likely be entertaining if you are a non-Scientist.

Before they started experimenting, Coldplay first attempted to put their stamp on a perfection of rock music. And while it may not perfect the genre, it certainly adds a lot into what rock is in the 21st century, and has to be considered in a list of top 100 albums in rock, as it really sets the stage for all Brit Rock to come in the decade."Don't Panic" starts the album off in a glimpse of what's to come: understated, but brilliant soft rock. The chords are all so strikingly original and driving, as showcased in "Shiver," a track that introduces you to question of 'why didn't anybody think of this sooner?,' which you will ask throughout the course of the album. "Trouble" is a striking piano-based ballad that chock-full of some of the most raw emotion Coldplay has recorded, and it again, it has some great piano-based riffs in the song. "Yellow" is probably the most recognizable track from the album, and rightly so since it has such timeless, yet mysterious lyrics. Again, it has some excellent musical prose, and some raw, yet simple emotions. A true Coldplay original, the track has led to a few covers, but I have not heard one that tops the original just yet.Overall, 'Parachutes' is a breakthrough, and in the battle of best Coldplay album, it depends on which style you like. If you like the grand and layered sound, then 'Viva La Vida' wins out, but if you like the simple, yet understated sound, then 'Parachutes' wins out. All in all, it's not hard to see why Coldplay is considered one of the best bands in the world today. Don't believe me? Their inevitable best-of CD already looks to be a killer.

Walking into The Book of Eli, I didn't really know what to expect aside from the fact that it's set in a depressing post-apocalyptic wasteland, and it features Denzel wielding a big knife and doing cool things with it. If that's all the movie had been, I probably would have been more or less entertained by it. But no, the movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, and for a movie about a book, it's a pretty solid film.What stuck me most about this film is probably the unique direction and world-building the film does. It's never really told what caused this apocalypse, but this post-apocalyptic world is kind of a beautiful world. The color has a very distinct tone to it, and even though the film mostly takes place in the California desert, the landscape seems very alive and striking. Watching Denzel just walk in front of a broken interstate towering above him is just a cool visual. And since the world is set 30 years after the apocalypse, everything looks it. Roads have a cracked, but dry quality. Cars are rusted, the paint on houses are peeling, and door hinges easily give way. Also, the world, at least as it shows, show society as reverted back to Western times. It's not really overt, but there's certainly the distinct feel of it in the scenes of the town. In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that they didn't go deeper into the world. I want to know what it was like before. What was Denzel like before all this happened. Was he in the condition that he was in before it happened? You can see a K-Mart name tag with Eli's name on it at one point, but other than that, the movie is very specific in its scope. I just loved what they did with it so much, I wanted to see more of it.Also, I've never see The Hughes Brothers at work before, but they have a great visual style. And it's not just the color either. It's the shadows, how they light the fight sequences, the camera angles, what you can hear, when you can hear it, and how it's emphasized. I usually don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think. Certainly, all the crew have promise, and I hope to see great things from them in the future. This includes a special shoutout to screenwriter Gary Whitta, who has never done a movie before this, but comes out with a splendid script for his first effort.But that isn't to say the movie is perfect. I could predict about 75% of the plot fairly easily, and I didn't have much love/use for Mila Kunis until she started blowing crap up. Still, by the end of the movie, they had convinced me that Meg Griffin could in fact be a believable bad-ass. There I said it. I thought it was impossible, but Eli showed me otherwise. Speaking of which...Denzel really is one of the, if not the highlight of the movie as the mysterious, but still thoroughly bad-ass Eli, who has a penchant for cutting off heads with a very sharp blade in the shadows. But it's not just the blade, as Eli is also impressive with a gun. Denzel pulls all the aspects of the character off with ease and coolness, while still being wise as all get out. Also, Gary Oldman is back in full form, channeling the slimy villainy he ruled over in the 90s. The character is a bit too serious, but Oldman makes the best out of the character.And then there's the end. A lot of people won't like it, but I like how it isn't the typical ending you'd expect from a movie like this. Is it believable? It's certainly a leap, but it works for Denzel's character, and makes him an even greater character. Plus, everything is wrapped up pretty nice, so I'll give it that too.Overall, atheists beware, this is a well-done movie that shows promise for everybody involved creatively. It also shows that Denzel is not without hope, Gary Oldman can still be slimy, and Mila Kunis can actually be cool. It's a surprisingly good movie and a satisfying one at that.

This is a very good movie.I live in house full of spiders. This movie makes you think twice about that harmless spider crawling across your floor right now.The movie takes a little while to get going and has a anoying charactor but it makes up for it. John Goodman is great in it. It is very underated. Watch it!

In more ways than one, Lost Season 5 is the best season of one of the greatest shows ever to air on television. It had all the elements that have come to define the show, and make it one of the most enjoyable experiences ever to hit TV. It had great character development, it had great mythology, it had great moments, it was original, and it had a superb story. And let me start off by saying that I'm a time-travel geek. I lay awake at night in fear of time paradoxes and my life being erased. I've also seen most major & obscure takes on the subject, so I followed and understood the whole season with the information that was given. I can see how somebody would get lost easily, but I understood it perfectly, and that's just because of my geekiness. Your experience with Season 5 may vary.Highlight Episodes:The Life and Death of Jeremy BenthamLaFleurNamasteDead Is DeadThe IncidentFirst off, the characters. Ever since Season 1, Lost has struggled with bringing new emotions, and stories that seem like they fit with the character, and not for any cheap or uninteresting side-note or plot device; that is if they even move the characters along. In Season 5, this is not the case, every character matures in a totally different way than we've seen before, and it does them justice. This is especially the case with Sawyer, who after 5 Seasons has finally granted my wish of wanting to see him in a leadership role. But he's no leader like any we've seen on the show before, and he's certainly no Jack. He's still the cool, nickname guy we knew before, but this is a Sawyer that uses his brain for somebody other than himself, and he just does it in some have called a "Winston Churchill" type manner. And this description would suit him well. We finally found a stable relationship for Sawyer, and for a long while there, he was one of the few characters on the show that had found some sense of happiness. Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid & Sun also progressed well from off-island life to island life, giving each of the characters a real reason to return that again suited their characters well. Heck, even Kate or Jack didn't seem annoying for a while there. Then of course, we saw Miles & Faraday grow into their roles on the show, as they became not only essential to the story, but they found a way into our likability circle. Sure, they may have came late, but especially in the case of Miles now, he fits right in.Story-wise, the season does start off a bit slow do to the whole 'We're Getting The Band Back Together' storyline. Sure it was essential, but it felt like it could have been condensed a bit. But that only lasts for a few episodes, and they're usually inter-spliced with the time-travel story (More on Time-travel later). But once everybody got onto the island, it just rocketed down the path of no return with each episode being slammed-packed with great moments & stuff we've never seen before. Keeping the show on the island, but moving it mostly to the 70s was a great change of pace for the season, and it was fun living in the Dharma world for a little bit, getting to know the characters, events & the company that shaped the island so much, even though we wished Radzinsky had bit the bullet early from the moment he started opening his mouth. But overall, I couldn't have been much more satisfied with the arch the season took, and it did a nice job of setting up the final season.As for the time-travel, I was stunned how the show took it in such an amazing/original direction. I mean, the whole island moves in time, stays in one spot for a while, then takes the castaways to another time period. And some of the stops are pretty amazing. We get to see the island in the 50s, the future, the 80s, and other various unknown points, and what the castaways usually found in these periods was just so fun for any Lost fan. I mean, the moment where the island skips in time, and a rope once dangling from a well was just sticking out of the ground since the well hadn't been built yet. So awesome. But that's not all folks, they presented time travel theories, created the time-loop timeline, and dived deep into the question of 'Can you change the past, or is what done is done? If you try to change the past, do you just eventually set it on its present course?' These are deep questions, and it was just so fun to watch Lost tread ground that most other media hasn't even touched on, much less delved into.Overall, time will tell its true placement in the series' hierarchy, but for me, it was one of the most fun and satisfying experiences watching TV in my lifetime. Sure, it's not for everybody, and it is hard to get a grip on it, but for those that can (and it certainly helps to watch all the episodes in a short span of time), then you might be half as keen to love it as I do. And what about those last 30 seconds? One of the best cliffhangers in TV history, especially if you have the chance to pop in the next episode right afterwards? I say yes.

Star Wars 2: Attack Of The Clones10 years have passed since the last movie, and now that little friendly, sweet, emotional boy, from the first movie is now a selfish, inpatient, eccentric Jedi. You heard me, but how did he get this way? Well the story explains it as his being to attached to his mother, so when he dreams her suffering, he decides that he will disobey his master's orders to stay, and of course leave to save her. The result is not pleasant, leaning an already leaning Anakin closer to the Dark Side.Meanwhile the scheming chancellor's plans fall into place starting a galactic war with clones. Nevertheless, like Empire the movie ends with the characters pondering over what's to come.The story moves better then one, but still things are discovered that are never explained, and not small stuff either, big stuff. Like who ordered these clones? You can think and guess, but that is as far as you can get. As for the Forbidden Love, George tries a teenage love story, which leaves you wondering, what does she see in him?Hayden Christenson does a just an ok job acting, but for the rest of the actors they did well with what they had, which was not much. Silly conversations and weak dialog kill certain scenes.Again, the special effects keep you from falling asleep. Also as an addition to the movie, Yoda is digitized and is now able to fight in a great fight sequence unfortunately it ends bad. In addition, this movie has the best soundtrack of all the Star Wars.Overall, a decent flick that is worth sitting through bad dialog for the action 3.5/5 Stars.Note: See my three other Unbiased Reviews of the Star Wars films.

Everyday Sunday comes onto the scene with a little heard bang, but a bang nonetheless. The first two tracks are great catchy rock songs that are sure to get stuck in your brain, unable to leave with it's good, clean rock. "Stand Up", although not a rock song, is a great highlight off the album.Question: Why is their a remixed version of "Stand Up"? It sounds almost exactly the same, maybe just a little bit more polished. But overall the album is a great debut that has been overlooked by most of the industry, but for those who have heard it, it's a gem in their collection, and easily one of the best debuts EVER! And a whole step above Relient K's debut, which isn't saying much but hey, it's nice to know you're debut is better than the best band ever's debut. Get the album, and you'll love Everyday Sunday. You'll be an instant fan.

Overall, if you go into the movie with the right expectations, you'll be in for a good thrill, a lot of fun, a one helluva sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, a very poor story, less than thrilling characters, and incredibly over-the-top action keep this one on the ground. I'd rank it third in the series, only in front of Temple of Doom, which it shares a lot of problems with.Real Score: 3.5Warning, if you have not seen this film, and have tried to avoid all spoilers thus far, you'll be well served when you see the film, because this movie is chock full of very important spoilers. It's darn tough, but I made it through three weeks of release without hearing anything totally major, and the experience was better because of it. From this point, be warned: HERE BE SPOILERS!!!Indy: Ahhh, since riding of on the Jordanian sunset, the good doctor has been very busy indeed. First, he fought in World War 2 (wouldn't you pay to see THAT movie???), and when the aliens landed in Roswell, he was there too, for some strange reason we're never quite privy to. The good doctor can still kick butt, and do incredible stunts, once again proving that like cows, Indiana Jones gets tougher with age. Whether you like this fact or not, since let's face it, Harrison can get the senior discount at Disney Land, right? Really, he hasn't changed personality wise since the last film, he's the same old professor, stressing old. You'll get giddy when he puts his hat on, and let's face it, you love seeing the icon again, right?Mutt: First off, what kind of name is "Mutt" for a potential future action hero? And what kind of iconic weapon is a pocket knife, which I believe is was lost in the movie? This could have been a great character, and in some senses he is, but he could have been a helluva lot better. He has a great personality, but he didn't really show he could be the next Indy like Phoenix did back in 'Last Crusade.' And I was very disappointed that Indy didn't pass the torch to Mutt. I mean, are we supposed to deal with old Harrison for another movie, kicking butt in a wheelchair? There's one scene where Mutt almost puts on Indy's hat, which would have been a great ending, but instead Indy takes it away. Very disappointing Spielberg.Other Characters: I found a bunch of characters in this movie just plain uninteresting. Marion, Mac, Oxley, the new dean, and the supporting baddies just didn't interest me. Not to say they were bad characters, I just didn't care for them. Bad character development. And Oxley could have been easily written out in favor for a more interesting plot-mover.Villain: Cate Blanchett is possibly the most overrated actress today. Which isn't hard, when she's almost single handedly dominated the best actress nominations the past few years. Her character could the poorest developed character. Nothing like Belloq, or that rich white guy from 'Last Crusade.' I mean, she pops up, and we're supposed to go, 'Ooohhh, she's real evil.' Not really, I mean, she's more freaky than evil. She's fascinated by psychological warfare? Really, that just doesn't pack any sort of a interesting punch. The character was also stereotypically Russian baddie, in a bad way. I mean, could the character be any more cookie cutter?The Action: Now, Indy has always been about action, so if you don't have action, you don't have an Indy movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem nearly as fun as it was back in the 80's, and it seems a bit forced, and at times uninteresting and unoriginal. Sure the motorcycle chase is fun, but the whole "Hangar 51" sequence seems a bit forced, although it does have some of the best moments of the movie. The whole chase sequence in the jungle on the other hand straddles the Hollywood line between believably and just plain ridiculous.CGI: One of the things that George and Steven wanted to do with this movie is keep down the CGI in most cases. However, on which sequences to use the CGI, they chose poorly. CGI BDA (CGI Big Damn Ants) are really testing that Hollywood line, and I really could have done without them. On the other hand, in the overall worst scene in the movie, Mutt swings Tarzan style through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys, and when you watch the background, either somebody forgot their CGI, or somebody needs to go back to computer school. I mean, that was absolutely pathetic, and reminded me of the terrible action background from 'Temple of Doom.'Over the Top: Let me count the ways...1. BDAs scaling each other to get to Cate Blanchett.2. Mutt's Tarzan aforementioned Tarzan sequence.3. Our heroes fall down 3 huge waterfalls with only a scratch to show for it.4. The fact Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion inside a refrigerator. Did it have airbags?5. The fact Harrison Ford can take down hefty men twice as young and twice as strong.6. The Aliens. Why Steven, WHY?!?Which brings me too...The Story: What bothered me the most was this: the reason it took so long to get another Indy out was because George and Steven wanted the perfect story, and it took them almost 20 years to find it. And THEY CAME UP WITH THIS????Let me set it up this way, Indy searches for El Dorado, the supposed city of gold with Mutt, who seeks his help to save his mother. Now I must admit, I heard this spoiler, since it already was the worst kept secret in Hollywood, and not hard to figure out. Mutt is Indy and Marion's son. So the family races the evil Russians to find the city of gold, which they find with the help of a half-crazed loon who looked into the eyes of the crystal skull too long, which looks strangely like an alien head. When they finally find the city through strange happenstance, they find a room with not surprisingly, a bunch of alien figures. These aliens by the way helped the Mayans build pyramids and invent technology, which of course they couldn't have figured out on their own, so of course it must be alien.The Aliens soon reveal the temple they've been living in as a large cover for their very large spaceship, which is a page directly out of Stargate. The Aliens then leave, taking all the baddies, and giving Cate an overwhelming amount of knowledge, which promptly causes her to explode. The aliens then take the whole valley with them, and leave no trace. Indiana Jones then explains that El Dorado was not the city of gold, but rather the translation of the city of knowledge. Indy and Marion then get married.I blame David Keopp for this utterly lazy and stupid story, and I blame Steven and George for not realizing it was as bad as it was. I mean, the aliens still look the same as they did in the Spielberg movies years ago. They just don't change their look. Now, I could rail more against the story and aliens, but it appears I've almost written a book here...Anyways, we now can add what to expect with 4th movies from now on. 1st movies in classic series are usually classic and groundbreaking. 2nd usually isn't that great, and is bitter disappointment, and a scar that the director will never live down, they're the ones that ruin the series. The 3rd one may not be as good as the first, but it comes pretty darn close, usually dealing with something besides the action, although that's still there, but it just adds a bit more heart. We can now say that the 4th movie is a crapshoot, and you never can know what to expect. The 4th may not be as good as 1 and 3, but it beats 2, and still retains the aspect of what made the series good in the first place.

Oh the movie males of the 1999/2000. Neo from The Matrix, Lester Burnham from American Beauty, Peter Gibbons from Office Space, The Narrator from Fight Club, Patrick Bateman of American Psycho. All of these men have the same thing in common. At the start of their respective movies, they're living in their own personal hell and are facing crises that must be remedied. Neo finds the Matrix, Lester finds beauty in the world, Peter steals from his company, while The Narrator & Patrick turn to more primal methods of coping. Sometimes the cause from these crises is due to consumerism, but it is often brought on by familiarity, which of course breeds contempt.Fight Club & American Psycho are the perfect companions for each other however, as they both contain all the above themes, and both deal with primal remedies that deal with madness and insanity in a world that inevitably breeds madness and insanity. American Psycho deals with the 80s, and how the Yuppie culture essentially created a bunch of consumerist clones. Fight Club deals with the late 90s/00s and how society has essentially made us into a bunch of wimps due to our lack of societal hardships to rise against. Where American Psycho leaves off, Fight Club takes and runs with. For the purposes of this review however, we shall analyse Fight Club.The Narrator is caught in a world of familiarity. He travels and gets to see America, but it's all the same to him. He works for a terrible and probably selfish company, and when he's in an office environment, it's soul-sucking. As a result, he can't sleep, and his lack of sleep is a reflection of his life's familiarity, and this familiarity starts breeding contempt, so he starts attending support groups so he can let his emotions through tears. And for a year, this actually work, and it probably would have kept working too if it hadn't been for Marla. Truly, Marla Singer set into motion the events of the rest of the movie because without her, The Narrator is perfectly content to cry his frustrations and emotions away. But since she is a distraction, his life is messed up again, so he takes the philosophical route. In the moment, right after the line "If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?," Tyler Durden appears. Bingo. The Narrator has just found the ultimate form of societal rebellion.You see, The Narrator/Tyler Durden sees society as a bunch of wimpy zombies. Rendered numb by society. Wondering around because they don't know what else to do. They take the easy path because it's the only path they've ever been on. The rebellion starts out small at first, with fighting. Then it turns into guerilla terrorism. But then, it all goes to hell. At some point, something went wrong. "His Name is Robert Paulson." Those are the words that send a wake-up call to The Narrator. Something has gone horribly wrong. He's been working for a way to free society from being zombies, yet he's created an ultimate army of zombies. The first rule of Fight Club is to never talk about Fight Club, yet everywhere he goes, everybody knows about Fight Club. Tyler Durden is just a name. A figment of an imagination. A shadowy figure that was born and resides only in legend. Thus, as The Narrator stands holding hands with Marla, watching the improbable financial collapse of America, there's no redemption except for death. He's gone on a journey to escape his own personal hell only to create another one, even more personal than the last, even worse because it's of his own doing. He can kill Tyler Durden, but Tyler Durden still lives on in all that's been created. There's no way to dissolve Project Mayhem. There's no way to stop the financial collapse. There's no way to live with himself. This is the cautionary tale of Fight Club. The tale of a man so numb, he took punches just to feel something, and wanted the rest of the world to be free. But with freedom comes a price, and a price that defeats the freedom in first place.The story is well-put together, brilliantly written, stunningly put-together, perfectly acted, hilarious, memorable, and most of all, thought-provoking, Fight Club is a quasi-modern masterpiece.

Continuum was one of the best, if not the best album of 2006, and one of the best in the already storied career of John Mayer. This follow-up, or EP if you will, gives a different spin on tracks for both Continuum and Try!, and in the end creates a mostly acoustic effort from Mayer that showcases yet another face of John Mayer."Waiting on the World to Change" is for the most part the same as the original pop classic, but this version seems a little bit slower, and has the background vocals of Ben Harper. The vocals really give a different spin to the song, and gives the impression that it was recorded for more of a black church setting. As strange as that may sound, it may be the strangest change to a song I've seen. Some may like it, some will flat-out hate it."Belief" is pretty much a straight-up acoustic radio session version; no real emotion, just served straight-up. And since the song really has no life to it, it ends up being the lowlight of the CD. "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room" on the other hand succeeds where "Belief" fails, in that it has real emotion, and Mayer seems to be really into the song, making it one of the highlights of the CD. "Good Love is on the Way" continues the trend, and with the acoustic spin on the song, as opposed to its original live, electric form, makes the song rather interesting."I'm Gonna Find Another You" is more of an acoustic blues, under the stars song, that Mayer passes off as emotional, all-but with a little sap mixed in with good measure. "In Repair" sounds just as great in acoustic form as it did in electric, and in the end, makes the song more emotional, open, and maybe more artful. This song also closes the album out very nicely, possibly saving the best for last.Overall, although it is a little short, this song is an EP, which is meant more to please the fans rather than the general public. And with those terms applied to it, it certainly succeeds in a way fans will adore. Mayer manages to keep the original art and heart of the song, while giving different emotional takes to them. Certainly John Mayer is the modern day Bob Dylan, going from acoustic to electric, but never losing his many faces and roots, and in the end, being the best quality artists of their days.

I got this movie on PPV but it would of been great at the cinema or HDTV.It has a great story! The Disators are the best you will see in a movie before 2004. The twisters are better then the ones in Twister. The tidel wave in New York will blow you away!The politics of it are off because of the vice-president. Other then that the movie is great!

Studio Executive 1: How about this? A New Yorker couple with marrital troubles are forced to live the country and eventually come to find love for the local townsfolk and each other. Oh, and they also get a kid at the end of the movie.Studio Executive 2: Sounds a lot like "For Richer or Poorer."Studio Executive 1: Yeah, but that didn't have Hugh Grant.Studio Executive 2: Tell me more.Studio Executive 1: It has Sarah Jessica Parker instead of Kristie Allie.Studio Executive 2: Give me a funny scene.Studio Executive 1: There's a bear outside their cabin.Studio Executive 2: Sold! Here's 58 million dollars.This is the thinking process behind "Did You Hear About The Morgans?." It's exactly what you think it is, and that's it. There's jokes about Sarah Palin, Bears, bull suits, and a dumb blounde. Also, it makes Hugh Grant out to be a pu**y. There's a joke scattered here and there, and there's enough plot to satisfy your grandmother. I was so desperate for something remotely interesting, I thought Mary Steenburgen was sexually attractive. Also, if you like Sam Elliot, there's some Sam Elliot here for you. Yep, that's all I can say about this movie. Never buy, skip the rental, watch it on cable if there's nothing on one night at your own risk.

With Blink-182 making their highly anticipated reunion, it's easy to see the effect that they've had on an entire generation, which changed their musical habits forever. When most of the world was in the unfortunate grip of bad pop and hip-hop, this group of guys clearly didn't care, and did their own thing. It was simple, at times immature, but at all times fun, and the band clearly knew their audience. Unfortunately, it's in reviewing an album like this it's hard to separate the legend from the quality. Is it classic rock, or immature crap? That'd all depend on your demographic.Highlights:DumpweedAliens ExistWhat's My Age Again?All The Small ThingsAnthemFor someone who grew up with this, it's classic rock at some of it's finest. It really birthed the pop-punk genre, it rocked from start to finish, the music and the lyrics were classic, and the album had a nice flow to it, so it also made for a nice overall project. It's almost revolutionary in this sense and even though I've grown up since the release of the album, the other day somebody asked me to act my age, and I said, "What's my age again?" Yeah, this album is/was pretty awesome.From a legend point, it's pretty legendary and influential. From quality point, it clearly did something right to bring a genre to the mainstream, and rocket it on the path it followed for the rest of the decade. In fact, most of the new pop-punk bands of the past 5 years had at least some influence from Blink.

I find it very hard to like John Wayne. He was like the Justin Bieber of the old Hollywood western. He stands for that all-American goodness so happy and honorable it wouldn't hurt a fly. He called High Noon un-American for its selfish depictions of the townsfolk, I call it one of the best westerns, if not the best western of all time. Here however, I actually like Wayne. He actually feels like a real human being as the gruff and tough Rooster Cogburn. He's likable, and he holds a nice presence on screen. Unfortunately, he's basically the only good thing in a film that hasn't aged very well.AMC has been replaying this film a lot lately with the remake having just come out, so it's kind of interesting comparing the two films even though they take their source material differently. Both Roosters are great in their own way for instance. Both Cheney's are kind of menacing, although Brolin is clearly much more so. Matt Damon is easily better than Glenn Campbell, but the remake certainly doesn't have a young Robert Duvall & Dennis Hopper hanging out in the background. Then there's Mattie Ross, who both movies rely on heavily for plot reasons and such. As such, the quality of both movies heavily ride on the character and how she's portrayed. There's a reason for instance why Hailee Steinfeld is nominated for an Oscar for her performance, because she carries the film very well, and makes Mattie Ross a strong female character.The original is quite the opposite, and as a result, the movie is kind of god-awful.Kim Darby never was a good actress in any sense of the word, but when she was a kid, she was just awful in every sense of the word. She's shrill, annoying, and just plain stupid. Granted, a lot of it is bad writing for the character, but Kim Darby plays her no favors. Instead of a strong female character, we have a little girl who Justin Bieber apparently stole his haircut from, who's hard to take seriously, and falls stupidly into the damsel-in-distress dynamic more than once. As a result, every scene she's in, which is a lot of the film, verges on either being laughable, or cringe-inducing.Overall, coming at the film from a very modern prospective, I found the original True Grit very hard to get through at times. Some of the acting is pretty good, and it's good to see John Wayne in one of his best roles, but Kim Darby's Mattie Ross kind of torches the whole production in a heap of cringe-inducing smoke, that looks even more smoldered now that we have a good remake to compare it too.

Warning to Alien & Predator fans, STAY AWAY, you might cry due to the destruction of a franchise!As a kid, I have fond memories of having nightmares of aliens after watching "Aliens," and looking in the shower, because you never know when one's going to pop out at you. Predator/The Future Governor Movie, also has a fun place in my book. Flash-forward to this unfortunate movie, and the franchise of both characters are utterly destroyed like the nuclear bomb at the end. Real actors? We can use bad/obscure ones! Character building? Who needs it! Gore? Got it! Shock? You'll be horrified!In fact, the only actor I found recognizable is childhood Shawn from the TV show Psych, and an alien leeches on his face and pops out of his stomach... This is a 10-year old kid we're talking about! But why stop there? How about a particularly disturbing scene where an Alien pops out of a pregnant woman, or an Alien finds himself in maternity ward? It's just simply disgusting. Because let's face it, they dumbed it down to today's disgrac... distasteful group of teens. There's teen sex, the blonde bimbo, the gore, and yes, all the intelligence of a gnat is used in this movie. I mean, the majority of the movie is set in a dark, rainy town where it's hard to see any of the action.Overall, if you're a teen, or not a fan of these franchises, or somebody that likes mindless horror films, in more ways than one, then this is the movie for you. For the rest of us "normal" people, don't see this, because you'll be regretting it if you do. By the end, I felt like I had an Alien popping out of my stomach. By the way, what would the citizens of Colorado think of having a nuke dropped in their state? There goes the tourism dollars!

I am now screwed in my movie-watching for the rest of the year because I'll be so hard-pressed to find something that doesn't make me say, "It was good, but it was no X-Men: First Class." I will go to comedies, but doubt I will erupt into applause again at the perfect execution of a joke so satisfying. I will go to action films, but I doubt they will use their explosions and action so effectively. I can go to horror films, but I doubt I will feel somebody die as much as I did in this movie. I can go to romantic films, but I doubt any will be as heartbreaking as this. I can go to dramas, but I doubt I will care for characters quite like I did with this film.Point is, X-Men is not only the best superhero film in my opinion, but a fantastic film in its own right, so much so that it has the ability to make other works seem amateurish. The previous X-Men trilogy? I'm currently in the process of erasing it from my memory. I cared more for characters that were on the screen for less than 5 minutes than I did for 95% of the original trilogy's characters. Thinking about characters like Rogue, or the fates of several of the characters in The Last Stand actively make me angry now when I think of them in context of this film.First off, a lot of credit goes to director Matthew Vaughn, who in my opinion is one of my top 3 directors working today. The guy simply operates at a level above everybody else in this film, and the things that he does with the camera, the way he makes you feel, and the way he does everything is just a wonder. Prequel films and origin stories are typically one of the hardest things to do in film, see X-Men Origins: Wolverine for proof, but Vaughn makes it look easy, possibly earning the distinction of being the best stand-alone prequel film of all time. The things you expect in a superhero origin story are all here: Training sequences, learning to use powers, discovering powers, coming to grips with those powers, and having responsibility of them are all touched upon here, and are all handled exquisitely.For the first two films, X-Men was certainly a grand allegory for both racism and homophobia, but here it's just elevated to a whole other level, and is truly relevant to these times. The Professor X/Magneto and MLK/Malcolm X comparisons are more valid than ever here, as both the men's true beliefs are explored to its fullest rather than the more implied 'Oh, well, he was in a concentration camp. That's why he's like this.' Here Vaughn includes the original trilogy scene of Magneto at the camp, but then continues after that and follows Magneto in events after that. The result is you completely understand the reasons of both men for what they do, and when Magneto does what he does as an adult, you feel his pain and the god-like fury raining down from him as he goes about the world bringing about vengeance.Which brings me to the action. The budget here was reportedly $120 million, which is less than most big budget movies nowadays, especially something like Pirates 4 or even Spider-Man 3 whose budgets can almost reach $250 million. Those films have nothing on this one. The acts of action are simple. The uses of the powers are usually simple. But you feel them all, and are usually stunned by them. You might have seen some amazing things in the trailer, but until you've seen them in the movie, and the context for them, you haven't really seen them. The lifting of a submarine for instance is a triumphant occasion, an amazing feat, and something that you're rooting for, even though it's performed by Magneto, who you know is not a nice guy in later films. It's not exactly a type of action I would describe as "fun," but rather immensely satisfying.I should also say that even though it's PG-13, you should consider this to be something on the level of The Dark Knight in terms of maturity. There's no character quite like the Joker of course, but what the film does with a simple coin is one of the most dark, violent, stunning and frankly, emotionally powerful I've seen in a while. That scene is also a testament to Vaughn's work, who takes something that probably seemed rather simple in the script, but with the use of camera angle, cuts, and the pace of it, you feel every moment of it, and it's disturbing. Then there's the whole Mystique kind of being naked, but not really since she's scaly and blue, and it's never been creepier to me than here when they show the Mystique form in her as a child. Then there's also it's clear use of the F-Word, which is, like the rest of the movie, effective.The acting is of course wonderful, as everybody hits all the right beats they need to with their characters. Frankly, they're so good that they make it look easy, which means you probably won't realize how good they actually are. A lot of people have cited how bad January Jones is in the movie, but I simply didn't see it. She is what she needs to be, and that's fine with me. McAvoy has never been better, the young talents are a revelation, Bacon is sinister as heck, and Fassbender is just something else. Then there's the gaggle of character actors, all of whom have played main villains in their own movies and shows at some point, simply populating the movie and adding more class to it. Seriously, this is a classy film. Also, "M. Ironside."Overall, I loved this fiilm. It left me and my mind in a constant state of being blown away, and it consistently gets better as it goes along until the tour de force finale. Its themes are heavy, its acting is fantastic, its characters are wonderful, its action is stunning, and its emotion is palpable. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, and if they do make a sequal to this, it kind of has to have Vaughn at the helm again simply for the fact that I don't know if topping this film is possible. Also, go to Rotten Tomatoes and take note of every critic who gave this a negative review, and give them a grain of salt for the rest of their careers. As it stands now, I am convinced that everybody who is giving this a negative review either came in not wanting to like it, didn't pay attention to it, understand it, or even seen it. Don't you make their same mistakes. I am pretty sure you'll come out of the movie liking it if you give it the slightest chance.Note: There is no scene after the credits. Once the credits start rolling, the movie is over. If you simply sit in the theater assuming that there will be a scene after the credits, you will be sorely dissapointed, you might curse at the movie, and I will laugh hysterically at you.

I don't get it, "Beautiful Love", "Someday" are great songs, the rest are OK. I don't know why, but they're just OK. Nothing really caught my interest except for two songs. But I might have found more if they had MORE THAN 10 TRACKS! I mean really, they cut some stuff, they had some stuff in the wings. Make me feel like I spent my money well! For ten dollars I could have gotten this on I-Tunes. Any more than that, and just forget it, it's a waste of money. But The Afters has great potential. They have what it takes to be a great band. They just didn't bring that in this album, except in small quantities. So skip the album, buy the above mentioned songs. Hopefully The Afters take advantage of their potential in the next album.

It's been three years, and an appearance on Jay Leno later, and Relient K is back, and changing the formula of the album yet again. The result is a blend of the best styles the band has to offer.The vocals and music are as superb as ever; the music entertains, and the album pleases mainstream and Christian audiences, as the band once again mentions God.Their fun side also returns, but with a more mature wit as "Crayons Can Melt on Us for All I Care" declares, "I just wasted ten seconds of your life."The most impressive feature is that the album has three highlights.* "Must Have Done Something Right" is a downright positive song that's very contagious with its use of wordplay, and will possess you to sing the lyrics long after the song ends.* "Give" is a song that is somber but sweet, and while not the typical Relient K fare, the song works exceptionally with a great melody.* Finally, the ten minute epic "Deathbed," a tale of a dying cancer patient reminiscing on his life, and finding peace with his past when he dies and goes to heaven. The great thing about the song is that it tells a story. The song also draws you into the emotion, so at the end you really get a sense of this guy's life and his pain. This is Relient K's "Hey Jude," an emotional epic that's a surprising crowd pleaser.Overall, an acclaim worthy album that offers familiarity, as well as some very pleasant surprises. This could be Relient K's best album and for my money, it is.

There is a debate among fans about re-releases. On the one hand, you get goodies like acoustic versions, new songs, and a DVD disc with music videos, etc. But, is it really worth buying the CD again if you already have it, or paying ten extra bucks compared to the normal edition, if considering the purchase? After all, you can live without it, right?The preferred method for introducing new material is the Relient K method - by releasing an EP after the main event comes out. Another way is to release the special edition simultaneously with the album, so buyers can choose. But too often you have to buy the CD all over again; and once you've done that, it's tough to trust them with the next CD (I'm still holding out on buying the latest Hawk Nelson, for fear of a future "Special Edition" release).This time around, Relient K goes with the simultaneous release. But, differing from other special editions, they choose to add no songs to the audio portion of the album, but instead opt just to add a DVD to the mix, which contains the making of the music video "Must Have Done Something Right," as well as the video itself. It also features commentary and exclusive acoustic performances.It starts off with six acoustic performances in the legendary Capitol Record Studios in Hollywood California, which clocks in at almost exactly 30 minutes. This portion reminds me of Jeremy Camp's "live" acoustic album in late 2005, with the whole coffee house vibe to it. This really is the highlight of the special edition, because you get to see the raw talent of the band, from all the member's vocal talents, to their amazing instrumental versatility. It starts out with a couple performances from mmhmm, including "I So Hate Consequences," which also fuses a little of "Life after Death and Taxes" with it, and a performance of "Who I Am Hates Who I've Been," whose acoustic performance was left off Apathetic EP. After a little banjo pickin' on "Faking My Own Suicide," we move on to one of Matt Thiessen's big inspirations `The Beach Boys,' and a cover of their classic "Sloop John B," which is fun and finely played. Next are two tracks from the actual Five Score and Seven Years Ago album, including one of my personal favorite Relient K songs, "Give," which is played very well, but not to the emotion it was on the album. However, this rendition still shines here. The last performance is "Devastation and Reform," which is a fine addition, but one of their singles like "Forgiven" or "Must Have Done Something Right" would have been a better choice instead. Taking a rock song like this down to an acoustic form is risky; it ends up just uneven, and comes out with mixed results.In between the acoustic performances are brief commentaries on making the album, the `Beach Boys' as inspirations, the versatility of the band, and a commentary on "Devastation and Reform." At the end of the performance, Thiessen comes out and tells everyone watching 'thank you,' and hopefully they'll do more stuff like it in the future. I personally think it would be great to even release a full album or DVD of nothing but acoustic performances, and maybe some more bonus features.Up next is a making-of feature on the "Must Have Done Something Right" music video, which runs almost 8 minutes long, and fuses the making of the video, commentary on the video, and commentary on the song itself. The commentary is fun, and unlike a movie commentary you might find on a DVD, the band actually talks about every scene in the video in-depth while on the set, explaining every move of the video. This can get repetitive at times, but the humor of the band keeps you interested. However, the continuous loop, and the mixture of other songs from the album as the background music is also repetitive and gets annoying after awhile, and could have done better by using more than just snippets of the songs. Right after the making-of is the actual video, which follows Matt's quest to impress his girl by trying to retrieve a soccer ball which is being kicked all around Los Angeles. It's fun and maybe one of the most creative the band has made so far.Overall, I wouldn't recommend anybody buying it unless they were a Relient K fan. There just isn't enough for the casual listener here. Out of the four music videos they've made so far, only one is included. And as with most re-releases, more could have been added, such as a "meet the band" featurette, special tracks added to the actual album, or the making of a song from Matt Thiessen's head to your ears. Wishful thinking, or can more really be done? After all, every re-release could have done more, and to my knowledge, none have been perfect. That said, it's aimed toward fans, and to fans I highly recommend. Relient K has built an outstanding album here, and this is the icing on the cake.

For most great artists, the debut is a monkey you can't get off your back. It's not that it's a bad album, just not up to the standards of their later and greater work. John Mayer himself considers this album and Heavier Things more of a mix-tape, a time in his career when he had to break out and say look at me, here's my best. There's no clear theme, just the best of what he had at the time. He also looks back on his early work as too much him, not about the music, a time where he just sang constantly, and wouldn't let the music speak for itself. The change is most evident in "83," a song about the joy of childhood and a longing to go back to that time. An excellent theme that everybody has felt, and he brings it out amazingly well. However, if he had written the song today, it would have been even better. So the last minute or so when he longs for his lunchbox would probably be axed in favor of the music itself.So taking the album as/is, and not comparing it to his later work, the album is an amazing little pop album. Another interesting this is the lack of electric guitar, and heavy use of acoustic instead. This is evident in the opening part of "No Such Thing," which is great opener to the album, and to an amazing career. Electric guitar still pops up in songs like "Neon" "Love Song For No One" and "Back To You." Wonderland also has an amazing electric solo in the middle of it."My Stupid Mouth" has the simplistic theme of talking too much, and getting yourself in trouble. Pretty simple, but still a good song. What's most surprising is that the theme carries into "Your Body Is A Wonderland" when Mayer sings, "I'm never speaking again." Which is what he says in the previous song. From just hearing the song on the radio, you'd never know this, but when you listen to the album, you pick up on the mastery of Mayer's work.With all of this amazing music, it's hard to pick favorites, but two tracks stand out on a whole other level from the rest of the songs. "St. Patrick's Day" is an amazing song that has a mood beaming with love and hope. The song is an instant classic, and could fit right into a hundred movies. "Why Georgia" on the other hand is on a whole different level because of its lyrics. A song about the quarter-life crisis is both as relevant as it is good. And when the chorus arrives, something unexplainable happens. Is it genius? Maybe... Mayer has also said he loves playing the song, because it's then he knows he's not the only one asking these questions, when you have a whole crowd full of people singing, "Am I living it right?" There's something there, and this album relates to people on a whole other level.Overall, while not as impressive as Continuum, it's still an amazing album, and the start of the best artist of our time. An instant classic that's great on so many levels, it's hard to count. Mayer does not deserve the title of a "Dave Matthews Clone," that's a downright insult to the amazing genius that takes place on this album.

Since I started getting into the phenomenon known as American Idol back when Carrie Underwood was singing, I had major trouble picking somebody I liked. I only liked Carrie because she looked better than Bo Bice, she also had the better name. The next season wasn't much better, Chris Daughtry was OK, but most of his songs were unknown to me.Then, this past season came, from his audition Chris Sligh had me hooked with his sense of humour and unique voice. He sang MuteMath, and covered the legend that is dc Talk. However, America wasn't sold, he was voted off early. However, he's back with his hometown band, and he bring his vocals, and his approach to music with him, but keeps his love for God. The result is one of the best debuts in a long time."Hero", "Know" "In A Moment", are just of few of the amazing highlights off this album. Let's face it, there is little originality in the world of Christian pop and rock these days. To cure your summer music blues, to find something refreshing and original, look no further, you found it.Note: that's my review below, but due to technical problems with the site, it didn't use my username with the review.Since I started getting into the phenomenon known as American Idol back when Carrie Underwood was singing, I had major trouble picking somebody I liked.

I really wanted to like this movie. I love Twilight Zone-type stories. I love sci-fi mysteries, and weird movies. But, do you know what I like more? Movies that have a point to it. The Box may have many well-done parts & elements to it, but stacked together, the movie comes crashing down in a disappointing heep of pointlessness & potential. Let's divide this movie into three parts, shall we? Warning: Here be spoilers!The first 45 minutes really plays kind of like the type of Twilight Zone where something weird happens that eventually leads to a moral dilemma. This moral dilemma comes packaged in a box, and happens to be a box with a button in it. Pushing the button promises to give the couple a million dollars, but it will also kill somebody the couple doesn't know. What would you do? You don't know if The Box is real. Heck, it could be one big joke! Granted, the guy who gave it to you gave off some bad vibes, but hey, how do you know he's telling the truth? It doesn't help that the couple has also recently learned of financial issues. A cheaper education for their son is denied, followed promptly by nose-bleeding by the denier. And the husband is denied entry into the NASA space program (I wouldn't be surprised if nose-bleeding occurs after this decision was made). So essentially, the first 45 minutes really is spent building characters, setting the mood and establishing a little of the reality. This of course all climaxes in Cameron Diaz pushing the button, leading her to basically be the 'Eve' in this 'Adam & Eve' story.Before we move on to part two, let's talk about the cast, shall we? James Marsden really hasn't been given a chance to show off his acting skill before now, but really, the guy can act, and he's naturally likable. Basically, I want to see more James Marsden in the future. Frank Langella is of course a fine actor, and he does the best with his character. As for Cameron Diaz, while her character is interesting enough, I was really put off by her southern accent. At least with Sandra Bullock in the Blindside I got over it after a while. Not true with Diaz here. It didn't help that she was trying REALLY hard in this movie too. But anyways, let's move on to part 2.The 2nd part of the movie turns into a homage to the paranoid conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s. This is probably the part that works most for me, as I ate most of it up. There were Zombie people, nose-bleeding, people in photographs, murder conspiracy. Richard Kelly just gets the mood so right in this aspect of the film, and it makes for a very good period piece. Of course, this is also the part of the movie where a LOT of stuff is thrown at you. I personally was able to keep up, but despite all the mysteries being explored, I didn't really feel like we were solving anything. Or even that we were being given enough information to solve it. Thus, I felt like I was grasping at slippery straws, looking for something, anything to help me grab onto a semblance of what this movie was trying to say. This 2nd act culminates in a library. This sequence again proves that the mood & paranoia at this part of the movie is just right. There's a part where James Marsden is being followed by an increasing number of zombies in the library that is just excellently done. Of course, for James Marsden, he's led to three portals, two of which lead to hell. Well, that can't be good! I don't really know why, or what is happening right now, but it still can't be good! Cameron Diaz also meets up with Frank Langella again and Cameron gets to have an emotional moment, and gives a revelation that I thought would actually go somewhere. I don't think it ever does. Basically, Cameron Diaz is turned into a Zombie, James Marsden apparently walks into the "correct" portal. Let's recap quickly. We have all these building blocks that haven't really gone anywhere comprehensible yet, let's hope Richard Kelly can bring it all back around in the 3rd act.But just when you think it can't get anymore weirder... IT DOES!3rd Act: We learn that Frank Langella actually used to work for NASA, but then was struck by lightning when the Viking Probe got too close to a planet or something, so Frank Langella basically dies, then turns into a messenger type for what I believe is aliens. It's never actually stated who his "employers" are, but they do have access to the afterlife, and crap like that. Then, at a wedding, James Marsden is shown by a previous guy who had received the box a bunch of pictures, and diagrams, and told that he also received a box and killed his wife to save his daughter. But then, that guy is killed. All the while, we are seeing other characters, including the kidnapped son into these portal pools. Why? I HAVE NO CLUE! Then we find out that the boxes are actually a test sent by the aliens or somebody to test humanity to see if they deserve living. In this way, it's like another Twilight Zone episode, one where the aliens are testing humans to see if they're ready to join their ranks, to which of course, the humans usually fail the tests. Anyways... Basically, to pass the test, you're supposed to simply NOT PUSH THE BUTTON. Then we jump to Diaz's and Marsden's house, where Frank Langella gives them ANOTHER TEST. Since they pushed the button, they must pay by either their son going deaf and blind for the rest of his life, or James Marsden killing his wife. Since the couple decide that they're the ones that brought this on themselves, Marsden shoots Diaz, perfectly knowing what happened to the previous couple, to which Diaz dies, Marsden is arrested, and their son is basically going to die as an orphan since the last Dad didn't exactly last very long in the land of the living. The movie ends with Frank Langella giving another box to another family. By the way, the moment before Diaz dies, another couple pushes a button, leading us to believe that this is an eternal cycle that will eventually doom humanity to extinction.Sorry if this review has been plot-heavy, but I had to tell you how INSANE and FRUSTRATING this movie was. But, it didn't have to be like this. Let's say that the movie ended the same way it does, but it shows another couple deciding NOT to push the button, thus not dooming humanity to extinction. Or how about this? Go all "Knowing" on us and actually show the world getting destroyed because everybody had pushed the button. As is, the movie gives us closure on the two central characters, I guess, but little else, especially in terms of plot. What is the moral of the movie? Don't be selfish, even when aliens are making your financial lives harder. As is, humanity is doomed to extinction because they pushed a button. An exploration of free will? Maybe. The better decision here would be to press the EJECT button on your DVD player.

When this album came out back in 2004, I thought is was the greatest thing ever. Now? Not so much, in fact, all the songs I thought were good, not so much. The songs I didn't like, I love.But I do have to give credit to their guitar guy, some songs like "Meant To Live" would have been terrible without that opening solo. In fact, "This Is Your Life" isn't that great either. It might have good lyrics, but the musical quality is not so great. The opening part to that is just strange, future of music channeling is what I call it."More Than Fine," "Gone," "Adding To The Noise," are a bunch of great little ditties, and really should make up more of Switchfoot playlist, instead of the harder stuff. Lyrically and musically "Gone" is a real winner, however, it should also have been the last song about materialism. I mean really, can the guy write about anything else? That's one of the reasons their last two albums haven't been good, it's all about materialism. They should have just stopped here."24," and "On Fire" are great ballads, and amazingly the band excels here, making these the highlights of the album, especially "24." Why can't the band make more of songs like these? These songs are gems, and shunned gems at that.The rest of the album isn't that great, filler material, including the title track. Overall, I like about half the album. The rest is throwaway. Sorry, Switchfoot, you could have done better. What's sad is this is their best album. Having said that, the album does have it's high moments, and depending on what you think of them, I would definitely recommend it.

Rollercoaster is one of the finer examples of great 1970s thrillers you'll find, but for some reason, it's mostly flown under the radar for all these years. Maybe it was because it came out in a time where disaster films ruled the box office, but in a film that seemed to fit the bill, there simply isn't much disaster. Or maybe it's the fact that a movie set around roller coasters, or people blowing them up simply isn't exiting/interesting enough. But I assure can assure you, Rollercoaster is surprisingly good and tense. It thrills, it excites, and it gives you serious hate for 70s fashion/music. Did I mention it can also be found on Netflix Watch Instantly?The real highlight here is Timothy Bottoms as the rollercoaster bomber. He's never given a name, he's never given a motive, and he's only credited as "Young Man." He's the type of guy you wouldn't mind hanging out with, and as long as his plan comes together, he's actually a pretty happy guy. Timothy Bottoms does a lot with little to go on, and succeeds by operating the character using the delivery in the minimal dialogue he's given, and his facial expressions. Oh, those facial expressions. He doesn't even need to speak. The camera could stay on Timothy Bottoms' face the whole movie and you'd stay compelled. It's hard to believe that this kid would one day grow up to be a George W. Bush impersonator and "The Asylum" member, but hey, he's the highlight of this movie. Plus, Helen Hunt is in this film briefly, and the great Steve Guttenburg makes a quick cameo in his first movie role.The plot is fairly straight forward. Imagine a terrorist bomber blowing stuff up and setting stuff on fire as part of an elaborate extortion scheme involving amusement parks. But as simple as the proceedings are, they're still well done. Scenes/shots linger and go on forever. The camera keeps following roller coasters, lingers on bombs waiting to go off, lingers on faces, and shots of people having fun at an amusement park. It all makes for surprisingly tense proceedings, and hey, it was the 70s, so it all seems plausible. Also, George Segal makes for a likable main character to follow around, and tends to lighten to mood and make the proceedings more enjoyable, even though he's a lowly safety inspector. The only real problem I have with the movie is the ending, which simply feels to rushed.Overall, if you can get past the bad 70s fashion and music, you have a great performance by Timothy Bottoms, a roller coaster crashing, and a Steve Guttenburg sighting. What's not to love? Check this underrated thriller out at least once, and make sure to grab some cotton candy while you're at it.

On the surface, "Push" has a lot of similarities to "Jumper." Both have heroes that don't want to be, have major parent issues, they're not great at their power till the end of the movie, and both are being chased by an African-American government official. However, instead of the whiny Hayden Christensen, we get a cool Chris Evans. Push builds up an interesting mythology surrounding its characters, but to do this, and establish the characters, the movie is a lot of shots of walking and talking, with not much action. When there is action, it's usually the heroes getting the crap kicked out of them, since they're not very good at their powers. And with this generally slow pace, the movie is very forgettable. You're still going to finish the movie, but you're not going to be anticipating it very much. Don't get me wrong, there's some cool moments, but they're few and far between.I also found Dakota Fanning's character both charming, and darkishly funny. It's not everyday where you find a 14-year old drunk in a movie. The movie does add it's interesting elements, but it's also mixed with lots of cliches and general confusion. As for the ending, while not giving anything away, it suspensefully leads up to it, and they wrap it up nice, but it's also cliffhanging with the overall story arch. Thus as the credits role, it's begging for a sequel. Guess what, it's not getting a sequel.Overall, if you're looking for an charming, slow sci-fi film with superheroes, that requires a sequel it'll never have, this might be the movie for you. Otherwise, it's a rental at best. And yes, I love Chris Evans all the more with this movie, and I wouldn't put this past as being a future cult hit.

In NatM2 Ben Stiller has gotten what he wished for, no not an Oscar, but a very successful inventor, yet even though he is very successful, he is not happy. Of course, he doesn't remember the old saying of 'Do what you love, and you'll love what you do,' so Ben makes a stop at the museum, for the first time in 2 years. When he arrives, he finds that the museum is being closed to replace all the exhibits with advanced video projections, and the old exhibits being shipped to the Smithsonian. Only one problem, the tablet that makes everything come to life is also going to the Smithsonian, which means that everything in the largest museum in the world is going to come to life. Well, that ain't good. Only problem is that Hank Azaria wants the tablet, and he's going to be his most intimidating to open up a portal to the dead using the tablet. Trust me, the story is just a thread to link all these history gags loosely together.While the old cast seems a bit tired and doing-it-for-the-money acting, the movie is helped by its new additions, namely the ever lovely Amy Adams as the bold Amelia Earhart & the ever funny Bill Hader as the wacky but cowardly General Custer. Both actors give a new life to characters that otherwise would have been like the rest of the movie, stale.The movie plays out in the old thinking of how a sequel is done. Instead of having a true reason to build on the old characters honoring the first film, the movie comes back just to come back, and only adds a change of scenery & new characters. But I must admit, while much of the humor is flat, I could not resist those Einstein bobbleheads!Sitting through NatM2 overall is not a bad watch, but neither is it a good one. Sure, the kids will latch onto humor in this movie, but you'll just be comparing it to the far better first movie. Rent it, and you might like it, just don't expect too much because it all just seems a bit too forced. But because of this movie, I love Amy Adams that much more...

As a budding writer, the thing that seems to be going "Giant Chicken" on me at every step of writing, is grammar. I mean, who came up with all this, and would it be wrong if this person "disappeared?" Anyways, all kidding aside, the subject of grammar can only be akin to "Ernie The Giant Chicken," who on "Family Guy," seems to kick the crap out of the main character, and just when the main character thinks he has the chicken beat, the chicken shows he's alive and well, and will live to beat the crap out of him another day.This book tries to combat the chicken, however, by providing everything you need to fight back. It's the all-in-one guide to grammar. A Reference. The Be All, End All. And it's conveniently pocket-sized. Simply put, the title says it all. And after you've finished the book, there's no reason to have grammar problems. I mean, you have all the rules right there, in one place. It's pretty easy to understand. But nope, grammar will still kick the crap out of you. No book will ever implant it, and make this stuff automatic for you. Nope. It comes from experience, and stuff like that. At least now, you know all the rules, in one easy, simple source, at a cheap price.

It took awhile, but the master finally made it on his own. This is in short a near-perfect album. There's something for everyone here, and more. But, you can't experience the true joy of this album without listening to the CD through some very good speakers, turned way up. This is truly some great driving music.The album is everything you want and more. It's catchy, it's rockin' but it also slows down, the beats are INCREDIBLE, but most importantly almost every song is memorable. You won't forget this album anytime soon.However, the only thing keeping this album from being perfect is Trudog. Yes, the kid is cute, and sometimes funny, but he's been on every single record. We need a break from the dog.Other than that, the album is a must-listen. However, I wouldn't recommend buying the album until the fall, when the special edition comes out, according to this very site. Get this, and you're sure to maximize the money you spent. So far, one of the best albums of the year. Is there anything the Mac can't do?It took awhile, but the master finally made it on his own. This is in short a near-perfect album.

Green Zone is an arrogant, self-indulgent political thriller that doesn't thrill, since you already know the story before it even takes place. Green Zone doesn't add anything new to the debate and doesn't really care to. Call it wish-fulfillment, or call it a misguided attempt at a compelling political thriller sprinkled with action, but Green Zone doesn't succeed in much of anything.First off, I actually agree with what the film is trying to say. My disagreement is not on a political level. Quite the opposite, the film actually makes some good points on why the WMD mishap happened. Granted, you have to work in the subtext, but when Matt Damon is shut down by his Superior's because of his rank, and because of the lack of questioning and oversight in the military, that's one of the real-world reasons. Greengrass also adds a lot of great detail to the film about the experience of the early days of the war in general, such as the mood of the citizens, the various looting, etc. It's the Clark Poundstone I didn't really care for in the least bit. Granted, you have to condense real people into a central person, but Poundstone is simply a one-note character there to be evil. But Matt Damon doesn't really have a personality either, as he is simply a vehicle for the events around him, and very little beyond that. Thus, since the writing is mostly terrible and everything else is middling, it's Greengrass' direction that makes it at least somewhat interesting. I like the way he uses the shaky-cam, I like the way he presents the movie, with the exception of dialogue scenes.But getting back to the Iraq War aspect of it, it all feels like water under the bridge since there is very little perspective to the movie. It took a good ten years for good Vietnam War movies to start coming out, and it took that long because the films had perspective. Greengrass thought of the idea in 2004 for the film barely a year after it happened. There's no way you can have prospective on it. There's no way you can look at the events without emotion or bias. The thing about the Bourne movies is that even though they were dealing with current issues, the fiction of it felt distant enough to give it a little prospective.Thus, Green Zone feels kind of like Bourne placed into the real world, and the resulting mash-up is sort of a trainwreck. Bourne dialogue now sounds stupid/poorly written. Bourne characters now feel needlessly one-note. Even the roguish Matt Damon character doesn't translate well into the real world. As a result, while Green Zone does some interesting things, it's not nearly enough to keep you engaged in the movie.

It was the 1999. A young filmmaker has finished writing a submarine horror/thriller film. He is ready to turn the script into a film as his second Directorial effort. Instead, he will direct Requiem for a Dream, which will be held in high regard by many. This young filmmaker was named Darren Aronofsky and that film was called "Below." Instead, the script lied around until it was picked up by director David Twohy, and after a few re-writes, the film began production, modestly budgeted, with a very unknown at the time cast. Then as the film was ready to come out, it was uncerimonisoly dumped by the sudio. What, a film distributed by the Weinstein was crapped upon and sent out into the wild to breed? Shocking, I know. The result was a gross of six-hundered THOUSAND dollars. It was subsequently forgotten and now lives on Netflix Watch Instantly. So, is it any good?The description of "horror film" doesn't exactly apply here. Below may seem cut and dry, and in some ways it is, but it's actually a mood-driven mystery thriller film set in a submarine, with some supernatural elements. Essentially, a submarine on the tail-end of its mission, the crew weary and on edge as all get out, picks up three Brits they were ordered to assist from a wreak, one of whom turns out to be a Nazi, who the crew quickly eliminates. It's about this point, unrelated to the Nazi mind you, that weird stuff starts happening. The crew starts seeing things, hearing voices, and the sub suffers a series of mechanical setbacks, all while the sub is being stalked by a German ship. Did I also mention that the Captain only recently became the Captain of the sub after the mysterious death of the old Captain.Like I said, most of the film is based on mood. As the movie goes on, as the bad things start mounting, and the crew becomes increasingly paranoid, the mood just gets more and more dire. Plus, it's set in a sub, and the mood that comes from that is great. Sure, people die, and there is a little violence/gore, but the film is overall VERY minimalistic. The most grusome death shown is a guy swimming outside the sub without scuba gear on the bottom of the ocean, where the pressure kind of expands him. Also, a guy gets a hammer stuck in his face I think, but it's really brief. Nope. The mood is why you should watch this movie.Also, the cast is pretty good considering how no-name most of them are, expecially in 2002. Zach Galifinakis is here in a somewhat substancial role (you can certainly reconize him from the beard), Scott Foley from TV's "The Unit," Holt McCallany from the recent movie "The Losers," Olivia Williams from various stuff (although she's the worst character of the film since she has a lot of annoying moments), Matthew Davis (who is actually pretty decent as the lead of the film) who played Warner from the film "Legally Blonde," and of course, you have the great Bruce Greenwood being Bruce Greenwood. This is actually one of the more villainous roles for him, but he's perfectly fine, even though he's part of a reveal and last 10 minutes I just didn't really care for.Overall, Below is certainly a film worth checking out. It plays with minimalistic horror a lot, and it strikes a very compelling mood, anchored (See what I did there?) by a suprisingly decent cast and script. It's not brilliant by any means, but it's certainly better than you'll expect it to be.

I can't resist a live CD/DVD combo from a band I like. So far, I've been happy, and this is no exception. Kutless does a great live show, great interaction with the fans, great stage presence and performance. However, their play-list isn't that great. Kutless has only done a few albums, and not many of those were great songs, so they're not going to have that many great songs to play live. This is most evident in the second half of the album, where the song quality really suffers, as these were from their early album, or some of the bad songs off thier new ones.That said, the first half is great. And the DVD only adds immensely to the experience. The filming is done very well and creatively. The few bonus features are also welcome.Overall, I would say you'd have to be a Kutless fan to like this enough to buy it. For the rest of you, you probably just might want to skip this.

As a guy that prides himself on never crying during a movie, I came darn close during this film. I can't really explain it, but this movie moves you. Maybe it's the universality of it all, the characters, or the humanness of it all, even where humanity seems to be only a shell of itself. Some say it's a story that warns us about our environment, being a kid-friendly version of 'An Inconvenient Truth," but it's more than that, because this movie is more about what makes us human.You see, around the year 2103, Fred Willard is the president of a company that's achieved global domination, but this world is quickly on the environmental downturn, so he sends humanity off on a five-year cruise, which as the scope of the problem worsens, quickly becomes 700 years. So around the year 2803, long after many of robots sent to clean the know global garbage dump known as Earth have broken down and gone silent, Wall-E is still diligently doing his job as if he had started yesterday. But even though he stacks haunting skyscrapers of garbage up, Wall-E is inquisitive about his world, picking up the various items that interest him, one of these being an old video tape that managed to survive, which depicts the companionship he longs for. But even with all this underlying sadness, there is hope for all with the arrival of EVE. Make no mistake it, in terms of quality, the first half hour of this movie could be the best EVER in filmmaking. All achieved with very little use of words, letting the emotions speak for themselves.But don't think the rest of the movie is dull, because while different, it certainly is good also. Let me also praise the stunning visuals, which look even better in Blu-Ray, the music, Ben Burtt, and director Andrew Stanton, who is so far the best talent in Hollywood today.Overall, I'm not sure if I'm ready to call this the best animated film of all time, but it certainly is topping my list of best film of 2008, for now. Even with all the hype, Wall-E is an underrated movie for the whole family that provokes thought, and shows us a little of what it means to be human, without being one himself.

It really helps if you can relate to the main character. You see, The Baxter is less of a romantic comedy that it is a romantic indie with some dry humor. But for what it lacks in a somewhat lackluster original story, the film makes up for with some great characters, some great scenes, and a splendid cast. The movie isn't overtly funny, but the humor derives from the characters, which makes it all the more funny when they do come around. For example, and spoiler warning, when Elliot finally conquers his 'Baxter' status and declares his love for his love, an old college friend of hers comes up to them at that very moment, knowing that this type of incident is what has messed him up before, Elliot runs after the guy chasing him away. Trust me, it's funnier when you actually see it.Overall, being a fan of Michael Showalter, I was pleased with what I found in a movie directed, written, and starring him. It's a good debut, and while I sadly don't expect we'll see another project like this from him again, it certainly speaks to his talents, both in playing the funny, and the serious emotional sides of the character. the movie may feel long at times, but it is worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of Showalter's.

You have to admit, it's a great premise. What would America look like and do if war was conducted on our own soil instead of across an ocean? But instead of going the conventional way of showing you anything and everything about it, director John Milius decided to give this depressing scenario a view from a bunch of high school kids. We don't even know the full extent of the attack until the middle of the movie. Interesting concept sure, but what looks good on paper almost never works when fully attempted.First off, with the exception of a young Charlie Sheen, the acting is bad... as in pathetic. Patrick Swayze is a guy you wouldn't expect this from, but he's one of the worst offenders. Then there's the plausibility of the Wolverine story. Sure, it's possible that a band of high schoolers could take on the Commies in small groups, but it wouldn't last for as long as it did. But it's Hollywood, so I give some leeway here. And there's probably a reason connecting with pride or something, but why didn't they just head towards "Free America" and help mount bigger and better attacks from there? At least they could fight on the borders, and receive supplies from the Americans. But instead, it's not until most of them are dead (more on that later), that they decide it would be better to not do everything independently.Then there's the plausibility of the whole Russian invasion. Now, I'm far from an expert, but wouldn't it be almost impossible for the Russians to launch that big of an attack, so coordinated, so problem-free, so quickly, without a huge retaliation? I'm just saying. It was pretty hard to do it back in the 80s, and word to the wise for those doing the rumored remake, it's impossible to do it today.Now don't get me wrong, the concept is very intriguing, and works great on paper, but the only problem is that it's extremely depressing. Call me an ever-happy schmo, but watching America being desecrated in such a manner with reeducation camps just doesn't exactly lift my spirits. It's probably not supposed to, but after 2 hours, it just drags you down. Add to the fact that all but 2 main characters die, including Charlie Sheen, in one downer of an ending and some painful scenes, and it's a bit overkill (no pun intended). I also didn't care for the fact that the ending left so many questions unanswered, leaving just a short narration. Here's a question, what ever happened to Patrick Swayze's character?Now, it may sound like I hate the movie, but I don't. I was entertained and interested, but the movie just falls in so many ways, it's a downer, and again, most of the movie is just depressing. It has some good American values, intriguing concepts, and some interesting character studies. It plays on the fears of the Cold War, and therefore has the most impact for those who fully experienced these 'I Play Chicken With The Train' times. So, in a battle of best Cold War 80's movie, "War Games" still wins hands down. So here's to America, the NRA and The Wolverines!

At first glance, it seems that Wanted is a 'Matrix' wannabe, especially in the first five minutes, but make no mistake about it, Wanted contains some of the best gunfights and action sequences in recent memory. It's bloody, it's profane, and it could be the best man's movie since the Die Hard series. Wesley Gibson starts out as a wimp with a pathetic life only to be swept in a strange fraternity of assassins, in which the training is incredibly brutal and painful. The reasons as to why, and what follows bring a couple of out-of-nowhere plot twists that wrap together a simple but surprising story. And unlike the Matrix, there isn't any grim future, and it's not as weird.But the main draw is the action, which is intense as it is brutal, and at times it's stunning, if not jaw-dropping. The cast also does a great job as relative newcomer James McAvoy makes a good action star, Angelina Jolie returns to the action genre, providing several curves for the movie's delight, and Morgan Freeman also pops up in another surprisingly good role for the legend. Overall, Wanted as least warrants a rental if not a purchase. It certainly keeps the heart beating as it were, and it looks stunning in Blu-ray, with a great assortment of bonus features. Now if we could only get a sequel, and change that generic title...

After hearing the praise from critics and the public alike, I decided to give the movie a try. After telling my father all the great thing I'd heard about the movie, and its considerably high position on IMDB, he decided to watch it with me. Well, he made it about 30 minutes through the movie, and left. I made it about an hour, maybe an hour and a half through the movie till I was too frustrated and confused to keep going.Story: I was so confused by the convoluted, confusing plot, I had to go to a myriad of sites with a full movie synopsis, to figure out what the heck was even going on. And even then, I was still out in the dark. So even though Christopher Nolan has never been one to make a simple plot, this one is way over the top. But wait, that's not all. This movie moves at a slower pace than most days watching C-Span. I mean good gosh, while this movie is at least a good two hours, it feels like you're watching a Peter Jackson movie. And the worst part is, you don't feel as if you spent your time wisely.Performances: Although the actors were good at portraying it, there was really only one emotion in the movie, anger. Not that hard to do. However, I was very surprised at the appearance of David Bowie as the character of Tesla, who I didn't even know existed till this movie.Mood: Very dark; Victorian London was never one for bubbling joy, but really, this is downright depressing. But, that's what this movie is going for, it's not supposed to be easy to swallow, or even fun, it's supposed to teach you a lesson, which I will get to in Morals. But, on terms of mood, the movie achieves what it's going after, and the amazing visual effects only compliment it even further. And again, Nolan knows how to create the mood he wants.Morals: Basically, the movie is about topping one another, and rivalries. And this is a rather bitter one, from crushing of birds, to wives dying, to trying to kill the other. By the end of the movie, you don't really care if any of them go, because they're acting worse than children. In fact, at times they're rather hateful, rageful, and use rather disturbing and strange ways to take their revenge. And of course, by the end, nobody wins.Overall: A very strange, confusing, slow, depressing movie, that really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Sure Christopher Nolan is good, at creating the mood of the movie, but it's not really a great mood. In fact, the number one mistake you can make in a story is you don't care for any of the characters. This movie only gives you more reasons to not like them. So if you like movies that only a critic could love, or you understand complicated story lines, or just like strange moral lessons, then this is the movie for you. For me at least, three words: Over The Top.

This is Chris Tomlin's best album, but that's not saying much since the others were mostly hit or miss. It's interesting because Tomlin actually toys with the arrangement of the songs, changing them from their album version quite a bit. "Indescribable" one of the top classics in CCM history, starts off as a very slow well done, but then quickly speeds up. I personally like the slower part better. But the crowd is great anyways, since every Christian in America has heard the song. "Forever" quite improves on the album version, and gives a great live performance. "On Our Side" is another great highlight."How Great Is Our God" is possibly the most improved song live, over album, in history. The album version was only OK, but this makes it from bland, to powerful. From skipable, to worship service lineup in church. And again the crowd really makes the song. When the crowd sings back a song with all it's might, it's an instant classic, and a great moment for the listener, and the artist.However, the album is quite short, 8 songs in all. Could more have been added? Most definitely, if he couldn't record anymore, grab some Passion recordings. The Passion version of "Famous One" is a lot better than this version. So, I would have liked to seen Passion version, but this is good. Chris Tomlin is going in some Hall of Fame somewhere, and for good reason. He still could be better, but he's made his mark, and few artists to that. So give him his props, he deserves it.

The 80's were memorable to say the least; in fact, it had an air all it's own. The music has stood the test of time, and still holds fond memories for those who lived through the decade. Apparently, the bands who appear on this album grew up in the 80's, and are covering their favorite songs, for better or for worse.Not surprisingly, Relient K brings the best work on the album with a true cover of "Manic Monday" that keeps the original spirit of the song, while still keeping the Relient K sound we all know and love. So if the highlight comes first, does that mean it's all downhill from there? Not exactly, as Hidden In Plain View, Sugarcult, Midtown and Motion City Soundtrack all put up worthy covers sure to appeal to any pop punk fan. Whether or not they're good covers is a different argument altogether. They're just good songs. Emery brings out their big guns next with "Holding Out For A Hero," which is a very good song up until the last minute when the song puts all its breaks on, and suddenly switches to a scremo-fest. Now, I may not be the biggest scremo fan in the world, but the sudden switch in the direction confuses me, and for me at least, ruins a perfectly good cover.For most of the second half of the album, we're treated to a variety of songs which range from the snooze-fest that is The Early November's "Power of Love," to the pleasing rock-fest of So They Say's "Forever Young." However, most of the tracks in-between just aren't memorable enough for any critique. But then I came across the California duo of JamisonParker's fresh new spin on "Everybody Wants To Rule The World." It's a techno ballad that's far away from the light Tears For Fears classic and one that is made the band's own with very good results. Amber Pacific then takes us out with a true punk reworking of the MTV classic "Video Killed the Radio Star."While no ground is exactly broken here, there is certainly something here for most everyone. Whether you're a nostalgic 80's fan, a pop punk fan, a fan of cover songs, or just a fan of any artist around here, you'll find something that'll float your boat, at least for awhile. Because even though you'll still come back to your favorite tracks, the album doesn't hold much of a lasting value. So get it for a nostalgic summer, or if you just need that one Relient K track, otherwise, pass this one up.

It's been two little known, but excellent albums from Everyday Sunday, and it's time for the band to make itself known, with noise. And that's exactly what the band does. From start to end, the album doesn't stop, no slow songs. The only thing close to slow is "Find Me Tonight" and that's only slow in the verses, in the chorus forget it, it's back to full blast."Wake Up! Wake Up!" is a great rock song, and one of the band's best. As for the rest of the album, great rock. It's about time Everyday Sunday got some attention, and with this album, the band gets it, and with good reason. This is a great find, and for those who haven't heard the band, this is a great place to start, because you won't be bored.

Star Wars 1: The Phantom MenaceAn even longer time ago in a galaxy (that seems to have infinite planets); we witness the beginning of the collapse of a democracy and the rise of an empire, in addition to, the development of a villain of legendary proportions.Unfortunately, the movie stands on special effects. The story has stuff that is never explained in the rest of the series, and what is explained sounds too Eastern Religion.Unfortuetly childish creatures come again in the form of big talking frogs. Again trying to appeal to children.Although the actors were very good, the writing they were given was bad. George Lucas wrote it himself, big mistake.Overall, the movie suffers from bad writing and another childish creature. The special effects are the only thing holding the story together; also, it spends too much time dilly-dallying around exotic environments. The worst out of the Star Wars 3/5 Stars.Note: See the other three parts of Unbiased Reviews of Star Wars.

Alright, I don't care about the ads, or the spyware. They shouldn't do that, but I'm not going to fuss about it. Putting that aside, I don't do multi-player on the computer, the Internet is just too sporadic for me. I only do multi-player on XBOX Live. Thus I don't use the multi-player here, just the single-player. Which would be fine, except there are five maps. What??? There's a ton more in the multi-player. Is it that hard to put AI in another couple of maps? It's not like there's a real storyline, just put AI in another couple of maps. But can they do this? Nope. In fact, you can't upgrade to new weapons either. You're just stuck with the basics, and that's it, unless you pick up something from a fallen soldier. Although a couple of the maps they give you are cool, they get boring after playing them ten times.In fact, it seems the single-player is just there to train you for multi-player. Doesn't make sense, but that's how it isThe graphics are okay, nothing totally amazing. The AI seems to be fine, no idiots walking through walls, or running in place. The storyline is just there for background, and is just there so you don't have to play another world war 2 game.However, you still gotta love the gameplay. After all, it is fun to shoot bad guys, jump in the car, and run over some more bad guys. And while the helicopters are kind of hard to operate, and aim, they're still fun to fly around in. The game is also missing something totally awesome, like the jet pack from Battlefield 1942.Overall, just an okay game. While the gameplay is great, you get the feeling the game somehow doesn't like you. The single-player is not great at all, and seems downright lazy. So, if you're looking for a multi-player game, this seems good. But anything else, and you might want to pass.

Star Wars 3: Revenge Of The SithThe moment two generations have been waiting for, the movie that answers the simple question, how? How does the chancellor's plan work out, why is he disfigured? How are all but a few Jedi exterminated? How are Luke and Leha born? In addition, how did Anakin turn his soul over to the devil? In addition, many more how's. Nevertheless, the question is does the movie answer these pondering question? Yes, most of them are answered, but smaller ones are not.Obviously, George Lucas had a very hard time connecting the two trilogies, and some stuff does not connect with the other movies, which unfortunately cannot be fixed unless he redid the original trilogies.What about the story, is it as bad as the first two movies? No the other two movies suffered because this is what they were leading up to, if it had been one whole movie it would have been better. Hayden Christenson said this is the part he really wanted to play, not the character in the last movie. The story transitions smoothly, the dialog is a whole lot better, especially the dialog of Obi-Wan when he leaves Anakin in the lava. Why are the dialog and a couple other things in the movie? George got some much-needed help with writing, and it's even rumored that Steven Spielberg did the Yoda, Evil Emperor Fight sequence.Is Anakin's transition believable? Yes, I know that people say that it's impossible, but it's not it happens to regular humans all the time. When you sin, you are moving to a kind of Dark Side.The special effects are excellent; some of the action sequences are stellar.Overall excellent, bad dialog is minimized, childish elements have been eliminated, the story and special effects now stand on their own ground, most everything is tied together, the movie stirs emotions, and the whole thing seems very satisfying, 5/5 Stars.Note: See my three other Unbiased Reviews of Star Wars.Note: The sequel debate is still up, George says he is not going to make any more sequels and prequels to Star Wars, but that does not mean other people can't do it, but to be fair do something new set in a different period, like the Old Republic.

It took a year to grow as Relient K released their second album. There were still references in the song lyrics--Breakfast at Tiffany's, Mr. Ed, Star Wars, Thundercats, Maybelline, Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Brian Wilson. But there are actually songs concerning worship.Distinctive from its predecessor, references utilize fun, as opposed to exemplifying a point. A case in point is "Maybe it's Maybeline" which addresses our fixation with blame--"Maybe it is them. Maybe it is me. Or, maybe it's Maybeline."The vocals clearly have grown, as shown in "Lion Wilson," a concise a cappella song. The tunes also have advanced, taking more of a punk feel, but varied with acoustic guitar for worship songs.Songs like "Sadie Hawkins Dance" and "I'm Lion-O" are enjoyable, and call the listener to dance. However, the real highlight is again an edgy song titled "Failure to Excommunicate," which speaks of excommunication in the world, racism, and loving outcasts.Overall, an entertaining album; the group has enhanced their sound, but there's still room to grow.By the way, the Gold Edition isn't all that much different, except for one music video, and that's really it. But there could be a sound quality difference, which I wouldn't know, without having the original album.

Don't let the first song be an indicator this is a good album. I've actually only heard of this band very recently, and I'm quite surprised considering how much talent the band shows with this album. How do you describe them? Think Lincoln Brewster doing rock/pop with a good guitarist. This analogy stands well when you listen to the first song, which seems very tailored to radio, and also drags on much longer than it should.But the highlight comes next "Really Free" starts off with a great guitar riff, and as the song progresses, you're like, this band could be the next big thing, especially when it hits the chorus.The ballad "Waiting For You" is a beautiful song, and really makes you wonder why this band isn't all over. They provide some great music, and for the songs that aren't that great, the guitarist makes up for it. Unfortunately, a few of the songs could have been done better, and they really show that the band could use some more experience.Overall, a great group with promise. While not inventing the wheel, and still a ways to go musically, this band could make a big splash with their sophomore album.

Back in the day when Radio Disney used to be a respectable organization (my have times changed), bubblegum pop ruled the airwaves and the kids ate it up. Sure, the station was still feeding off the pop mania of the late 90s early 00s, but hey, it made money. And Disney sure knows how to pick its talent, since almost every artist on that station is either totally obscure and homeless and/or on drugs. Then there was Hilary Duff... Ahh, Hilary. She ruled the #1 spot every weekend on the Radio Disney countdown, she had catchy music, and to tween boys everywhere, she looked better than sliced bread. Then there was this wonder of an album which produced hit after hit. It might have been the first album I considered buying. Fast-forward quite a few years and I'm quite older, more mature, and my tastes in music don't even compare to the Radio Disney days. So how does the album hold up?Clearly there was some top radio-friendly talent on here, with such songwriting and producing legends such as "The Matrix" and new American Idol judge, Kara DioGuardi, all noted for writing hits for Avril Lavigne and Celine Dion among others. Disney pulled out all the stops here, and it pays off. Songs like the highlight "Why Not," "So Yesterday," "The Math," and "Come Clean" are all innocently catchy, and since you'd never be caught dead listening to this, it's also a great guilty pleasure.Of course, you're bound to have some clunkers like the dumb "Sweet Sixteen," and even though the songs may not be the most original, or most vocally proficient, they're radio-friendly to the core, and doing what it does, it does well. Not that it's respectable in any manner, it is produced for tweens, and I think it's better than the majority of what Miley Cyrus' crew is able to turn out. You surely won't find any horribly pathetic and painful covers of Cyndi Lauper here.Of course, if I was the same age I was back then, now, then I'd probably be gawking over Miley Cyrus, and laughing at her stupid show, resulting in far fewer brain cells in my brain. But back in the day, this was what was hot, in more way than one. It may not have been the best thing in the world to listen to for the musical brain cells, but it jump-started the bubblegum pop revolution that's climaxing with Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers. This also sold more, with 4 million copies, as opposed to 3 million Miley put out there with her debut.

So the first track, kind of weird with the name "It's Not Over". But as far as lyrics are concerned, not much to say, in fact, the whole song seems familiar, the whole feel, another rock song about a relationship. Original? Hardly. It works for the happy with the packaging music fan, but leaves something to be desired for the rest of us."Home" is a great track, considering it came from a mainstream band. It really fits American Idol well, since it was written about coming home after the famous show. I'm not against the song going to Christian radio, just like I wasn't against "The Fray" doing the same. But I ask, what's the point? It's an interesting thought though, mainstream bands thinking enough of us Christians to support their music enough? We might actually be gaining credibility in mainstream circles. Interesting thought, good song."Over You" is another good song, not great but good. It won't be as popular as his other songs because it's different from the other rock tracks, I think in a good way. But, as always, I could be wrong.

When I first heard a the guitar solo on "Her, You and I," I knew that I was going to have a time breaking away my ears from this new indie rock group. But it didn't stop there, as I listened to the rest of the album couldn't get over the fact that it made me exited about rock again, for the first time in a long time. After that, I became infatuated with the indie music scene, especially Indie rock, and haven't looked back for very long since."When I Wake" starts off the 'day' theme of the album, and gives you a taste of what's to come. It's a great little song and it's only made better by the Daytrotter Session version. "On A String" is a little bit too light for the album, and kind of breaks the great vibe going on. "Water of the Gods" starts off the bouncy morning rock vibe permeating the album, and this song is a prime example of this sound I'm talking about. "Sisters" has a strange song structure, but it adds great variety to the album and comes off as one of the main highlights of the album."Modern Love" seems a little short for what's there, and delivers in the verses, before completing its cycle at the chorus. Truly indie rock, they do a great job musically tying the ends and outs of the song together. "Her, You and I" is the best song off the album, coming off in an epic fashion that slowly builds through standard song form, before breaking down for an exquisite guitar solo with some great organ mixed for good measure. This is truly one of the great guitar solos I've heard from somebody not named John Mayer. Truly genius. You'll launch into an all-out air guitar rock fest when it cranks into high gear. The song then comes to a close you don't want to see coming, but at least the song goes out on all cylinders before moving onto the self-explanatory "When I Sleep."This would be the perfect album to listen to while cleaning the kitchen. With their great brand of indie rock, and certainly one that defines the genre for me, The Changes put you in a sublime mood, and gives an album that will surely be around for awhile. Now when's the follow-up coming out?

Cool World is vaguely interesting, random, strange, weird, but never is it, for one second, funny or anything close to enjoyable. What exactly were they going for? If it was to please cartoon fetishists, mission failed: the film is PG-13. If it was to create an interesting film around a vaguely interesting premise, mission also failed. The characters are dull and lifeless, the acting is just short of competent, with Brad Pitt coming off the best, and he's forced to used a hushed tone for most of the movie. The writing is awful, the pacing is unbearable, and they consistently fail to live up to what their interesting premise and all the interesting things you can do with it.If they were aiming for a dark comedy, mission also failed. Unless you like random-cartoon characters randomly appearing and doing random crap to each other. Also, the music. The music is god-awful with a mix of techno and early 90s pop. It speaks to the movie, which is off-putting. Take it from me, don't watch the movie, just move on. There's nothing to see here in this epic failure of a film.

Going into Cloverfield, I was incredibly curious. Would I vomit from the camera? Could this monster be the next Godzilla? Could a movie work with NO stars? Could J. J. Abrams flop in the face of hype again? To answer those in order: No, Doubtfully, Yes, No. In fact, I think this movie is an instant classic that isn't afraid to turn Hollywood rules on its head. What Abrams and company do is take the old premise of monster in NYC and take it from a whole new Point of View. And POV is what this movie is all about.Main Camera Man Hud is obviously not good with the camera, as seen in the beginning, compared with Jason's camera work. Being from the younger demographic, this shaky-cam doesn't phase me at all, since I am probably used to YouTube effect. And let me say, if you thought Hud's camera work was bad, you should see mine. Nobody would have made it out of the theater without falling down in a dizzy drunken stupor. So anyways, while we're used to the normal omniscient camera style of the all-seeing-eye, seeing everything, this style does have its advantages. It provides the film's best "Oh Crap!" moment in the tunnel, when they turn on night vision.The bad thing about this style is the fact that it's very hard to keep up with the camera, and everything going around. So, it's kind of hard to tell which person is dying, and who is alive. It didn't help any that both Beth and Lizzy were both brunettes. So, it took me awhile to figure out what happened on the Brooklyn Bridge, who was put into the helicopter first, and who was with Rob at the very end. I also didn't know that Lizzy's helicopter went down. But thankfully, there's Wikipedia to give you a scene-by-scene summery of the movie's events.I also liked the little touch where everytime the camera was turned off, you had the little moment's of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date. Not much, but it just seems to strangely work in the movie, and gives a nice break to the action going on around.Speaking of action, it's pretty darn good for a movie made on the budget of most romantic comedies. The suspense and action keeps you on your toes, and there's plenty of cringe moments that keeps the mood all the more intense. Although I really could have done without the exploding stomach and the rescue of the impaled girl. But I thank the movie for being restrained, since they could have easily gone into R-Territory, which would have made the whole film a cheesy horror film. Oh yeah, it would be "The Blair Witch Project."Let me also say that the famous/infamous Statue of Liberty head in the streets scene, will go down as one of the classic Hollywood scenes. I mean, the scene is just so classic. Head flying down and rolling down in the streets. The Shock. The "OH MY GOD!" being repeated over and over. The Surprise. Total classic.For being a no-star movie, everybody in the cast does an excellent job. There's no bad acting, no fake acting, all the emotions seem real, and in fact, these actors do a better job than their more famous counterparts would do. And for a lack of character development, I liked most of the characters in the movie, and when I could tell that they just died, I was saddened by their loss. Except for Marlena, who I didn't get the appeal of.However, when it came to Hud, I was deeply saddened by his loss. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of T.J. Miller since he stole the show on the now cancelled Carpoolers. The guy is just likable, and he brings his personality to Hud. Alas, this brings me to my next complaint.Why did Hud have to die? I mean, he just seems to be cheapened when he's eaten by the creature, just for the sake of us getting a facial glimpse of the monster. I would have liked it if Hud was like the only survivor, and found a way to escape operation "Hammer Down." Sure, incredibly unlikely, but still. Instead, the film ends up a bit depressing, since basically every character you've met during the course of the film, is dead. And the monster seems to still be alive. Yet, it's nice to see the profession of love at the end, and it again, strangely seems to work.But for all of that, you also have to add the realism of the entire thing. I mean, if a monster like that were really to attack NYC (highly unlikely), that's probably how it would take place. And most importantly, these seemed like real characters, not cardboard cutouts of twenty-somethings.So overall, for it's realism, originality, execution, characters, and premise, this movie earns the title of "Instant Classic." It defines a era that is 2008, where terrorism is the first thing you think of when a major disaster happens, the YouTube/Camera Phone culture and just society in general. It's the little things that make the movie more than the big things, and they work in unexpected ways. Sure, I would have probably changed a couple of things, but it all seems to work. As for the rumor of sequels, I'm a bit hesitant, as is the crew, because you really need a new gimmick, as this has already been done. And quite well I might add.

I'll admit it, I got into "Failure To Launch" and gave it 4 stars. This on the other hand is a new low for all involved, which basically means it's barrel scraps. It's labeled as a romantic comedy, yet their were no real romantic moments, and the majority of the comedy comes from two minor gay cooks. Sure, there are other redeemable elements, but they're few and far between. It's National Treasure at sea, except less exiting, less humorous, and more juvenile (Wow, that's pretty bad). First the bad elements.With the exception of a few Kate Hudson (although I would've preferred another Sarah Jessica Parker outing) and the general rough jerk-persona of Matthew McConaughey, the acting is bad to pathetic. The villains being the worst offenders, with not even that Cosby kid showing one bit of prose. Ray Winstone is bad as always, along with the main villain, Bunny, and his white hired gun. And poor old Donald Sutherland gives possibly the WORST performance of the movie, and/or his career. Matt's sidekick doesn't add to anything either. The story is unoriginal, and obviously little to no thought went into this treasure tale, so I won't dwell on the plot. The action is also mostly uninteresting.Good elements? Well, Donald Sutherland's screen daughter does well as a stupid and ditsy Paris Hilton like character. There is some good humor involved, again mostly coming from two minor gay guys, and a few of Hudson's comments.Amazingly, it could've been much worse, but not by much. Being from the director of "Hitch," you'd expect something a bit more quality, but this movie has more holes than Hugh Hefner's water bed. This movie all but fails in what it set out to do, and I wouldn't even recommend this for renting. There's plenty of better date movies out there, so just say "NO!" to this movie, and move along. Not much to see here.Real Score: 1.5

I have read and finished this book. The only book better than this is the Bible. This author is definitely the torch carrier for God. There is no other book on the market today like it. I will carry this book with my Bible. It reveals truths from God no other book has. I am surprised that this book is not a bestseller. Pick up this book and your relationship with God will never be the same again.

I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. This will certainly be a movie I pick up when it comes out on Blu-Ray later this year. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!

Whether you call it post-punk-laptop-rap or just plain good, MC Lars is the most underrated rapper out there, and probably the most original. In probably his first major EP, MC Lars lays it out on the table in all his geeky/fun glory. Since it's independently produced, it is a bit rough and sounds like a demo. "iGeneration" and "Signing Emo" are later found on his semi-major label debut, and they mostly sound the same. Songs like "Hurricane Fresh," "UK Vise Versa" and "Straight Outta Stockholm" are great indie rap, and entertaining to boot. "Mr. Raven" on the other hand is not only great indie rap, but an excellent rap track period. Dare I say it's MC Lars' best? Perfectly incorporating Edgar Allen Poe's famous poem, it kicks the beats, brings the cool, and MC Lars lays it down, scaring the crap out of all comers. Overall, while the project isn't MC Lars' overall strongest, it does contain some great tracks. So if you haven't the Lars, then lay down your cash for The Laptop EP, which is slightly less expensive then a laptop.

Pay it Forward is a mixed movie, and I would only recommend seeing it once. Why? While 'Pay It Forward' is a great social concept, the movie takes a very cynical approach to the world, thus creating depressing scene, after depressing scene, interspliced with optimism. Haley Joel Osment was an expert at these type of roles, where he basically was the shining light in all these dark depressing movies in 1999, 2000, and 2001, and he alone makes you care about the movie. Kevin Spacey also puts up a fine performance, but again, his character seems to be wrapped up in all this depression. Helen Hunt's character on the other hand seems to be the cause of most of this depression.What makes this movie so depressing? Maybe it's all the child abuse, molestation, drunk people, drug addicts, gangsta bullies, and the ultimate depressing moment at the end of the movie where spoiler alert, the kid dies. Ultimately, 'Pay It Forward' is probably the most optimistic/depressing film I've ever seen, and it just deflates you. I like the concept, but the movie is depressingly executed.Real Score: 2.5

I'm coming out of the closet right now. I'm a Roland Emmerich apologist. Independence Day was a seminal film of my childhood. Godzilla was an entertaining/memorable film. I've probably seen The Day After Tomorrow more than any human should. And I am one of the few that remember and kind of like 10,000 BC. Thusly, I was in the theater Day 1 for 2012. A true Master of Disaster, nobody can destroy the Earth like Roland Emmerich can.But first of all, there's setup. Wait? What? Roland Emmerich blows stuff up, Roland Emmerich doesn't do character development! I'll also admit right now that 2012 probably could have been cut down, expecially in the first 30 minutes, since it is too long of a movie, and it takes a bit too long for the Earth to start crumbling down. But even so, the actors do fine with what they're given. John Cusack is John Cusack, Danny Glover is underused, Chiwetel Ejiofor did the best with bad material, and Amanda Peet should never be allowed to be in a film again. And again, while the plot is serviceable for the destruction, the parts where the Earth was getting the crap kicked out of it could have been cut down. As for the Mayan Prophecy, stupid? Yes. Serviceable for giving an excuse to pulverize the Earth? Yes.First major action sequence: Los Angeles crumbles apart in a GIANT Earthquake. How crazy is this scene? A car drives through a collapsing building. Believable? No. Fun to watch? Oh yeah. Then we get to see Las Vegas get hit by that same GIANT Earthquake. How crazy is this scene? We get to see a plane dive below and above collapsing hotels. That's pretty exiting. Then we get to see the Super Volcano at Yellowstone blow its top. Believable? No. Fun? It lingers a little too long, but yes. Then from there, it's just a crapstorm of disasters. The Vatican comes down, making for some religious symbolism. Cruise ships get flipped over by waves. The White House is crused by an Aircraft Carrier. All variety of places are hit by giant waves and are flooded. A plane crashes and its occupants have to get off by using expensive sports cars. Again, while you do have to wait a while to see all this happen, it's incredibly satisfying & cool when you actually get to them.But what I also love about 2012 is the absolute insanity of it. There's a scene where two characters are saying how they're feeling apart from each other, just for a GIANT crack to open up between them in the ground. The movie even takes the all-popular crazy, but correct guy and takes him to the next level with Woody Harrelson. Nothing is destroyed in a nice way, or just a simple explosion or anything, no, it's long, it's drawn out, it's destructive, and it's a beautiful thing to watch. At least for me it is. Your opinion may differ. I mean, there's a scene where an "Ark" is fixing to crash into the Summit of Mt. Everest, aka the highest mountain in the world! INSANITY! And they squeeze the scene out with everything that it's worth, then some. If this isn't Roland Emmerich's love letter to his admirers, like me, I don't know what is.Overall, 2012 is the CGI grandfather of all disaster films. The SyFy channel & other disaster movies spend two hours on what takes 30 seconds here. Remember Poseidon Adventure? You get that in a cooler looking 30 second sequence. Have you ever watched Category 6, or one of the many other SyFy channel crapfests that aim to destroy the world on a measly budget? Yeah, I have, and 2012 takes a dump on those films in all its two-hundred million dollar budget glory. So as unpleasant, or as poorly scripted and drawn-out as 2012 may be at times, it's Disaster Porn at some of its finest.

Word To The Wise: Watch the trailer for the gist and most of the "comedy" then come in the movie when the flood happens. You'll save yourself almost and hour and a half, and wonder what idiot movie exec let the budget for this mess rise above 75 million.First off, this is supposed to be a comedy. The result is a movie where most, if not all, of the humor comes from Steve Carell, but even he can't sugar-coat most of this poorly written dialogue. And while Jonah Hill and JMH provide a few laughs, they are tossed to make room for Wanda Sykes. Now, she was already overrated, but in this movie she give a killing performance that just screams razzie. I didn't find myself laughing at any of her crap "jokes." And again, they're just trying SO hard to be funny, it ends up laughable, but in a bad sort of way.Steve Carell is given the unfortunate job of carrying this movie on his shoulders, and even though he does a good job for most of the movie, the character could have been interchangeable for most of the movie. Lauren Graham makes a good mother, but again, a poorly written character. And John Goodman just sinks lower and lower with every role he plays, and this one is no exception.The story isn't that great. A bit predictable and a bit too long, even though it's a short movie. But when it anti-climaxes at the flood, it's a fun and enjoyable ride complete with great effects and some interesting symbolism. But that lasts for what, all about five minutes?As for it's family-friendliness, it's a little confused. While it does have plenty of predictable, but nice messages for the whole family and all those annoying/cute/CGI animals running around, it does stumble. Most glaring of these unfriendly errors is when Carell says if the flood isn't a "Water-Type Flood," he'll be "Pi$$ed." That's really nice for the little ones. And then you're half expecting for somebody to get struck down when they keep saying OMG. Sure, these little gaffs won't offend most, but if the movie is marketing to a primarily Christian family audience, you have to keep the questionable stuff out.So overall, Steve Carell plays the role of Atlas in this movie, carrying the whole film on his shoulders. Unfortunately, you can only do so much with bad writing. And there's plenty in this movie. From the pathetic excuse at comedy from Wanda Sykes, a story that annoys you more than anything, and a few language gaffs that could have been avoided. So wait till the Starz Bunnies cut this down to 30-seconds, because they'll have more laughs than this films does, and it'll be much more entertaining.Real Score: 2.5

MirrorMask is nothing short of the weirdest and most imaginative movies I have ever seen. It is also the farthest thing from a mainstream film as you can get, as 9/10 people will absolutely hate this movie. If you can get into as I did however, and appreciate all the visuals they were able to accomplish with an incredible 4-million dollar budget, then you'll appreciate the subtle humor and originality of this film, throughout the pure strangeness of it all.First off, this movie is purely a British production, so it highly retains a BBC-tone to the movie, and all the actors are completely unknown in the States, and by no-means stars in Britain. However, Stephanie Leonidas and Jason Barry are excellent in their roles, and really help draw you into the movie, giving you something to identify with. Because, with all the weirdness going on, it's incredibly easy to lose yourself in the film, becoming lost in the vast land of the unknown. The actors and characters therefore must keep you focused, and they do this well. Of course, if the visuals weren't enough to throw you off track, the story will. Sure, it could have been better, and it draws influences from many staples of the genre, but in-between all this, I still liked the movie.Maybe it's because of the subtle humor, that's both witty and hilarious. Between the flying books, and the other strange assortment of characters in this movie, you almost can't help but laugh.Overall, chances are you're going to hate this movie, and you wouldn't be alone. There is nothing normal about this movie, and it's part of the reason why it's so good. Sure, the film could have been cut down 15 minutes or so, and the story could have been tweaked, but you might like what you see. It's probably a one-time watching event, and who knows what Jim Henson would have thought of it. I personally think he would have loved it. It has Henson written all over it, from the characters, to the humor, to the the weirdness. I think he would have been proud.The Librarian: 'Take the book, if it goes back on the shelf, it'll just depress the other books, causing them to huddle together and molt.'Pure genius...

After the unprecedented success of "Hanging By A Moment," Lifehouse took the genre they inevitably bore and ran with it. The result is a follow-up forever foreshadowed by the success of its predecessor, but arguably tops it. Taking a heavy-dose from the grunge genre, Lifehouse all but nixes any acoustic or poppy elements from their sound, as it all takes a very raw, rough, but rockin' turn instead. I personally love every moment of it, as it's on the edge, and it's almost one long consistent jam session that the band really ran and had fun with.Standout tracks include "Spin," "Sky Is Falling," "Stanley Climbfall," and the highlight/album-definer "Take Me Away."Overall, on a recent list I made of the top 15 albums in Christian music, I placed this particular work at #9, saying "If 'No Name Face' bore modern rock as we know it, then "Stanley Climbfall" perfected it. It's still one of the most consistent records I've ever heard." Well, that pretty much sums it up. It's highly controversial, especially since this album has been largely forgotten, but it is a true masterpiece in the genre of modern rock. Sure, 'No Name Face' has the moving work of "Everything," but 'Stanley Climbfall' has the consistency and the driving "Take Me Away." I still am however confused about the title. 'Stanley Climbfall.' What does that even mean?

Why not follow a bad effort with a worse one? Why not abandon all early fans? Why not make an album that's just made for the pathetic radio crowd? That's what they did. "Presence" is just as bad as "Amazing Love" and song like "Blessed Be Your Name" are downright pathetic covers, and some of the worst in the industry.Overall, boycott this sad effort from the Newsboys. It's a truly bad album with no substance.

Invictus is a failure in of the key elements of filmmaking: Make the audience care. As an American, this was going to be no easy task. We don't know the first thing about Rugby, Eastwood doesn't really present the sport well, and what's worse is that he doesn't really present the events well. I came into the film being interested in the subject after studying it, and what happened before the events of most of this movie. The movie spends all of 30 seconds on this, thus giving no real context on why this is all important. But if they'd done that, it would have been hard to be invested anyways. It's a sports movie, but it's not a sports movie, but it uses all the cliches of one. The result is a very fine balance the movie has to walk, but it ends up tripping over. When speaking of a portrayal of this subject matter, cheesy should NEVER be something you use to describe it at any point during the proceedings, but cheesy is the word I'd use here more times than not, especially when it comes to the music.There's a song called "Colorblind" that plays in the middle of the movie that gives us the heftiest dose of unintentional cheese. The song is exactly what you think it is. It's an inspirational song with the most insufferable lyrics ever conceived, with its chorus being "I'm colorblind!," followed by African chants. This is supposed set the tone for an "important" scene, and it comes off as anything but. The same with the title song that plays over the credits. The music is just a metaphor for the film as a whole. Too heavy-handed and serious for its own good, when the film is made by a bunch of Americans.The cast is decent, but only headlined by two stars, and mostly unknowns for the rest. Matt Damon is a blank slate with a distracting accent. But Morgan Freeman highlights the film in a performance that just fits like a glove. Who's the most natural person in Hollywood to play Nelson Mandela? Morgan Freeman. And Freeman does very well in the role, even if the writing is far from top-notch.Overall, the great Nelson Mandela deserves a lot better than what this movie gives. Its tone is inconsistent and all over the place. It hold very little interest for the viewer. It's ineptly paced and it's just SO BLOODY LONG! Well, it's only 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Sorry Eastwood, I just wasn't feeling this film, and I wasn't really a fan with what you did with it. Sorry, but this could have been a lot better, and I was hoping for more.

Maybe it's the fact that they lost their director, or the recasts were plain awful, or the character that actually novelizes the events from the first two films, or a combination of all the above and more that make even this film pretty sad even within the genre of action/adventure films. But at least it has enough mindless action to somewhat save it. Yet, you have to wade through a 'daddy issues' subplot, whiny and sometimes atrocious dialogue, and questions like, 'How exactly did the son lose his heavy British accent in the course of 10-20 years, in order to sound almost American?'In the 1st Mummy of this series, there was a great blend of horror/action/adventure. The 2nd lightened up the tone, replacing most of the horror with a great sense of humor; of course, it was a retread of the first, but it was probably best of the series because it was the most entertaining. The 3rd on the other hand does bring the action, but that's about it, as it leaves you shaking your head more often then not. It's still a great rental, and one for HD and great sound systems; just don't expect any substance to this popcorn flick.

Well, at the second half of the CD. "Love Song" and "Finish Last" aren't exactly the best worship songs in the world, but they're still pretty good. In fact I used one for a Bible Study. "Life Is Good" is good. Wow! Who knew that?The rest of the songs are the poor man's Relient K. Yeah, they're better than some of the lame excuses in music nowadays. The album is short, fast, and will leave you wanting more, of that. They didn't provide that with the second CD. You see what you get, what it looks like, is what it looks like, that's Stellar Kart. Take them or leave them.

I'll admit it, I was watched this film. But only once. And it was when it premiered on Cinemax. As I recall, it was a simply terrible film that wasn't very scary, was frankly boring, had actors that deserve MUCH better than this, but oh, that ending. I still remember the ending. Looking back on it, the ending actually helped the movie since I still remember it. This movie should by no means taken seriously, so I will not write this review seriously, instead, I shall try to remember all I can about it without looking it up online.Alright, so the main girl comes home to her lake-side house to live with her father after a stay at a mental institution, where she was coping with her mother's death. Her sister is there, and her father, played by the great David Strathairn, who has a new girlfriend in the form of Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks is playing the role of the evil step-mother here. The main girl thinks Banks is only there to still her father's money, and then kill him, but why she is so evil to the main girl. The main girl also finds out that Banks might have been a babysitter that killed a few kids or something, and the main girl is also haunted by the ghosts of the kids, and the kids pop out as ghosts and provide the "scary" moments.In the end, the main girl and her sister are almost killed by Banks and then... My mind gets fuzzy. I'm sure it wasn't important. Point is, the main girl was actually batcrap crazy the whole time, and imagined most all the proceeding events. Her sister is actually dead and died in a house fire that killed the original mother, and it was all started by the main girl accidentally, which made her insane. Thus, Elizabeth Banks was actually a nice person the whole time and was not evil. There's something to explain away the ghosts or something, and the main girl actually kills Elizabeth Banks in real life, rendering her ultra batcrap crap crazy, and poor David Stathairn is left without his girl friend, and an insane daughter that has basically killed (accidentally of course) his entire family. Let's see if I was right (Hold on while I look up the plot to gauge my accuracy)...Alright, so it was even more crazy than I originally remember. Wikipedia has the full plot details here: [...]Point is, if you watch this movie, you'll be mildly entertained, but not in a good way. This is a stupid, stupid movie that's as crazy as its main character and is not really recommendable to anyone, unless reading the plot synopsis really interests you.Note: I wouldn't mind Elizabeth Banks trying to kill me. I'm just saying...

If you knew the ending of "Knowing," then you probably wouldn't want to watch it, because then you might know more than you needed to know. No matter how you slice it or dice it "Knowing" is an interesting concept with very poor execution, weak writing, philosophy that isn't worth thinking about, and one bizarre last half hour. But if you can say one thing about the great Nic Cage, it's that whether it's good or bad, his movies are always original. That's a my summation of the movie, if you want to go deeper, SPOILERS FOLLOW!The part that I didn't like about the movie is that it's simply a short story stretched into two hours. How have I come to this conclusion? Because, the aliens at the end of the movie went too out of their way to get the kids. All they had to do is take the kids in the middle of the night and start over. Not like the kids would remember, it seemed as if their minds were erased when they got to their new homeworld. Of course Nic Cage would still be the messed up & doubting guy he is at the beginning, but I found his personal journey weighing down the movie anyways. So instead, the underrated I-Robot director Alex Proyas throws numbers in there, and disasters. But all of it is for naught at the end, so it kind of seems pointless. Again, the film tries to ask these deep questions about philosophy, but again, the movie's questions are worth thinking about the way they are posed here. So it's again pointless.But don't worry, if you like prolonged and lingering shots of people and animals burning alive, you've come to the right place. If you like shots of people getting crushed by subway cars, then this is your movie. If you like shots of the end of the world overlaid by inappropriately joyful classical music, then this is the movie for you. If I wanted all that, I could have watched Final Destination, but "Knowing" thinks its way better than it is, and it disappointingly falters under its own weight. Also, you should probably be off world, or at least on the other side of the world when a solar flare strikes Earth. Those things are a b**ch!

Dawn Richardson is a RARE talent in the music world, one that actually has an amazing race. She has have one of the best voices, if not the best voice in CCM, and one of the best in mainstream. She's that good. She can do soft, rock, hard rock, with no sweat. Don't believe me? Listen to "It's You", which is not only vocally flawless, but is a great song period. "Attitude" is a great rock song, and very memorable. And even though I'm not a big fan of hard rock, this album actually had me liking it, to some degree.Overall, a vocally flawless album. Oh, I forgot to mention the background guy. He's a great voice in his own right, and could front his own band, but combined with Richardson in the above mentioned songs, and it's magic. The songs are great, the rock is great, I would recommend this, even though I'm not a big fan of hard rock. But who knows, maybe their next album will be less hard, and twice as good. Then it would definitely be one of my favorites.

On the day of the 6th season premiere, I finally decided to watch Lost to cement the fact that I will forever be six years behind or ahead of pop culture. I would have watched sooner, but by the time I wanted to jump on the bandwagon, a lot of my friends jumped off, "It was great for a while, then it just got weird" they'd say. But now, with the final season upon us, and with my hearing that answers will be/have been given, I jumped on the fated Lost plane. Thus, this review will be in the context of a first-time viewer starting from the beginning, so forgive me if these facts are later changed, resolved, or otherwise not true in later seasons.Highlight Episodes:PilotWalkaboutAll The Best Cowboys Have Daddy IssuesHearts & MindsDeus Ex MachinaFrom the opening moments of death-dog, Vincent waking up our fateful hero, then finding out that a plane has crashed on an island, and the ensuing chaos that follows, Lost comes up with one of the best pilots in TV history. It's absolutely mesmerizing for anybody that watches it. How could you not become a fan after watching this? The beach scene not only has some great special effects, but the tension and feeling of terror on the beach is just so well-done. In fact, this scene is so iconic, every show like it that has come afterwards has tried to come up with their own version of this scene. Guess what, they all fail. What may seem like a simple scene, is actually an encapsulation of all that makes Lost a great show, at least in the first season.Another aspect of Lost that the show does so well, is that while it's most known for its story, it's characters hold the show together, and it's mostly what makes the characters so good. It's so hard to get to know so many people since it's an ensemble cast, but by the end of the season, you get a good sense of most/all of the characters, their motivations, and what brought them to the island.Jack is the reluctant leader who was told all of his life that he didn't have what it takes to be a hero (He's also the first of many characters we learn that has MAJOR daddy issues). Sawyer is the local conman, unlikable maybe, but he gives clever nicknames, so he can't be all bad. Locke is the local philosopher, always the wiser, he struggles with issues of faith. Sayid is the local Iraqi torturer. Hurley is the comical fat guy with a heart of gold and a harsh unlucky streak. Jin & Sun are the local Koreans that are surrounded by emotional and linguistic barriers. Charlie is the local drug-addicted former rockstar that finds a new addiction in the pregnant/sweet/cute Claire. Boone & Shannon are the high-class step-brother & sister that slept together. Michael & Walt are a father & son that struggle to build their relationship. And even though Kate is often criticized for being the worst character/actress, she's a tragic type who's built by circumstances, and only suffers because she's the least likable out of the whole cast.To build out and flesh out that big of a cast in only 25 episodes is an amazing accomplishment to me, especially since a lot of it comes in the form of well-placed flashbacks. And again, in this season at least, Lost puts its characters above its story. Sure, it may string you along with a few mysteries, Lost Season 1 was all about the characters. This is where Lost succeeds, and for me at least, makes it such a compelling watch.Overall, it's a must that you at least try the show out at least thought the pilot, and probably through episode 4 or 5. If you're not satisfied by this point, then you'll probably never be satisfied, and if you continue and make it through the whole season and you still don't like it, then just drop it. This is the best that Lost has offered so far, and to me, it's a TV gem.Also, if you've already seen this season, after you've seen the whole show, I hear it's equally comelling and facinating the 2nd time around. Which is always great when a show stands up to, and even benefits from repeat viewings.

Sunshine's plot is Armageddon meets Alien, where the sun is dying, you have to get a bomb to restart it, then a creature comes and messes the whole thing up, making an already hard job, that much harder. Chillian Murphy is as good as always, but really the standout actor/character in this film is Chris Evans, who audience might know from the "Fantastic 4" series of films, and here he plays a brave and logical engineer, who in my opinion, really elevates the movie.Sure, the rest of the crew are idiots from going off track with the mission, chasing an extra bomb that may, or may not work, but you're into it, aside from most of the character's sheer stupidity. But making the characters not that bright in seeing the potential consequences that could happen, it's like they're almost asking for something to go wrong. It's not enough that it turns into a suicide mission, but due to a insane madman that wanders onboard, it turns very badly, with people being murdered left and right. And yes, the critics are right, all the built-up momentum the movie has going for it falls off from here. It's almost like the writer didn't know how to extend the movie, so he put a mad slasher character in there.To make matters worse, this film is really below Danny Boyle, and if this was the first time you were seeing the work of this fine director, you will be sorely disgusted as my father was. Because, for whatever reason, Boyle feels the need to use slow motion, shaky cam and blur effects whenever the scarred madman is on screen, which is very distracting, not to mention disorienting. Did they not have the budget to show the full figure?In either case, Sunshine is a good concept gone bad, like the mission shown in the movie. Sure, it has its likable elements, but it just takes the wrong turn, then things start to get ugly. Not to mention it's a pretty forgettable work.

In more ways than one, Hearts in Atlantis is can be compared, and could be considered worse than Twilight: New Moon. I don't know how the book is, but Hearts in Atlantis is one of the most paint-by-numbers Steven King works I've ever watched, and what's worse is that the filmmaking behind it is deplorable, with a basic misunderstanding of how a film works.The story is that of a coming-of-age tale of three kids in the 1960s. The film will tell you this by showing you pictures of the trio playing set to period music like "The Twist." Did I also mention that it barrows HEAVILY from Stand By Me, with none of the interesting plot, conversations or acting that made that movie good. Anton Yelchin is an ok actor, but when this movie asks him to carry it, he simply can't do it. Thus, all the "acting" in the movie is centered around Anthony Hopkins. But I even have a problem with him. Granted, I can't tell when the man is mailing in a performance anymore, but if you wanted Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins, then by golly, you get Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins. Defenders may say, 'Oh, it's so well acted!' No, it's just Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins.Let's get back to the story. Essentially, what make this film interesting is that Anthony Hopkins has some sort of psychic ability which I believe he passes along to the boy. At one point, Anthony Hopkins relocates a girl's shoulder, psychically. This should be one of the more critical emotional points of the film, but instead it's presented in such a lifeless form that it fails on any level of what it was trying to achieve. Maybe this is a side-effect of the pacing. The pacing is such that when something actually happens, you just get angry because you were waiting for something to happen. Guess what folks, NOTHING DOES. The grand finale of the movie is Anthony Hopkins being taken away by the "low men" and Anthony Hopkins yelling out to Bobby, "I wouldn't have missed it for all the world!" Looking back on it as an adult, Bobby also says this line as if to reinforce the fact that the characters believe this to be true, even though you could really find no evidence of this being true upon looking back on the film. I mean, besides the fact that I've never met a psychic old guy, I've had more interesting coming-of-age stories myself, and I consider myself a fairly ordinary person.Other Quibbles: Hope Davis plays Bobby's self-centered mom. Granted, I don't think they were going for a likable character here, but it's hard not to be at least the slightest bit happy when she gets raped by her boss whom she's been sleeping with.Overall, this is movie makes Hearts In Atlantis Steven King's "Twilight: New Moon." It's a coming-of-age story where two people form a supposedly interesting relationship where there is no interest to be found with characters, who lack any sense of depth, which is not helped by the fact that the acting is poor. Plus, NOTHING HAPPENS. It may be good for hardcore Steven King fans, or hardcore Anthony Hopkins fans, because God only knows you get a lot of Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins, but otherwise, this is a BAD film in almost every sense of the word. I watched it for free on Netflix Watch Instantly and found my free time with the film wasted. I implore you not to make the same mistake.

As a Community College student myself not so long ago, I was interested what NBC Comedy could possibly do with such a wacky institution. The Results? I wish I went to this Community College...First off, the show does take great liberties with the setting. My experience may have differed from the norm, but mostly what I saw was a bunch of apathetic people who couldn't wait till the moment they could get back home. They would never go to a candlelight vigil at night for example. The people of Greendale are the opposite of that. They care about EVERYTHING. They will create a candlelight vigil for wacky causes, and bake cookies for everybody there. Of course, the setting also gives a great sense of openness and freedom for the show. In this world, the possibilities are endless and anything can happen.Next up, the stories. At the beginning, the show struggled hard to find itself, being more hit or miss more than anything, but after the first 5-10 episodes, the show really entered its own. A relationship doesn't work? Drop it! A pairing doesn't work? Separate them! Two actors had more chemistry then you originally realized? Put them together! A personality is too negative? Change it, then make jokes about it! Nothing holds this show down, and each time it comes down with more flair than the last time. May I also note that almost every episode takes advantage of each classroom setting really well? Plus, especially towards the end of the season, the episodes turn into complete brilliant parodies. An episode that takes on "Goodfellas" and other mafia movies? Do it! It's hilarious!Plus, the cast is great for everything that is thrown at them. Joel McHale is excellent of course, Chevy Chase does a serviceable job, and everybody else, who were basically unknowns before the show, really break out here. This includes Donald Glover, Allison Brie, etc. Plus, Ken Jeong is great as always, and that's always a plus.If you're still not convinced of the brilliance of Community, watch "Modern Warfare." Not overrated in the slightest, it's the best episode of TV period of the last 6 months, and the best episode of comedy in the past year. Everything that makes this show so great came together PERFECTLY for this episode to absolutely gut-wrenching comedy. Never before has ridiculousness, parody & inspired brilliance come together before like this since "Airplane!"Overall, in a year where The Office shows considerable signs of aging, new-comer Community upstages and BLOWS AWAY its older brethren. It's only a matter of when for the show to get a big cult following like The Office once did, so jump on now. It's just now starting to get really good, and you don't want to miss a minute of it.

Fact: Most of the disaster films of the 1970s were god-awful abominations of cinema. Earthquake, Airport, The Swarm etc. The lone exception probably being The Towering Inferno, and that's mostly by the good graces of Paul Newman and the great Steve McQueen. How bad is Earthquake? The directing is an absolute embarrassment, the writing is horrid, which is sad considering it was co-written by The Godfather book/movie writer Mario Puzo, the special effects were laughable even for the time period, and most of the actors/characterization in this movie is dead and/or dying, the lone exception being Ben Cartwright from Bonanza because let's face it, he's Ben Cartwright from Bonanza. Also, Walter Matthau is in here for absolutely no reason at all.Charlton Heston plays a businessman who is having an affair with a young mother, while having marital troubles with the nagging Ava Gardner. Ava Gardner is also the daughter of Lorne Greene, aka Ben Cartwright, even though they clearly look the same way (in actuality Ava is 7 years younger than Greene). George Kennedy plays a cop that picked the bad day to be on the job. Richard Roundtree is a motorcyclist who thinks he's a lot better than he clearly is, and then there's Marjoe Gortner. Everybody that I asked who remembered Earthquake all said the same thing, they remembered Marjoe Gortner and how he ruined the movie. It's easy to see why they'd say it. Gortner plays a grocer who can only be described as an arrest away from officially being considered a pedophile and/or sexual predator, and he has pin-ups of male body builders on his wall, giving the assumption to his roommates at least that he is gay, to which they proceed to call him offensive slang and throw things at him. He also happens to be a National Guard Sargent, so when he's called to patrol the city during the Earthquake, he snaps, kills people, and comes close to raping a girl. I don't know exactly what the purpose of this character was supposed to be, since he really isn't consequential to any of the proceedings, the character comes off as offensive in every possible way. Did I also mention that the way all these actors portray their characters can be best described as wooden?I could go on riffs on how the director was incompetent to say the least, the ending was needless and perplexingly bad to say the least, but in the end, Earthquake is just a bad movie on many different levels, for two hours, without any redeemable qualities. Nobody really liked it back then, and the only reason it was popular was because it came out in the absolute height of the 1970s disaster movie era, where it came out in the same year as The Towering Inferno and Airport 1975. Today, Earthquake has aged like sour milk left in a hot shed for 30 years. Nobody really liked it back then, and today it's just an utter embarrassment of filmmaking for all involved. In fact, the only thing good that ever came out of this movie was a Universal Studios ride, and even that is somewhat debatable.

Non-fictional books are never useless. The only difference in its productiveness is how much information you can glean, whether it be how to do, or not to do. And in this book, there is much to glean, however, there are also parts that miss their marks."Branding Failures" is about failures in business, which is always great to study, as to not to repeat history. Each of the 100 cases looks at a business failure (classic, idea, extension, PR, cultural, people, rebranding, tired brands, and E-Failures) its story, and it's reason for failure. Each conclusion is mostly logical, even with a little help. In fact, not a case goes by where the author does not cite, or use another's writers explanation. Chiefly mentioned is the classic market manuel "The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing," and authors Jack Trout and Al Ries. However, there's a point where these sources are cited so often, you're left wondering, 'why not just buy their book?' However, a book examining all these failures in one place differentiates itself from others, in addition to the great advice is gleaned from it. The author himself even adds some great advice every once in a while.Also keep in mind that the author is of the UK, so there are a few companies that haven't crossed the pond, or are just local. For example, there's a London nightclub, and a few other British companies. So, there is a bit of a cultural barrier in understanding a few of the companies. It's also written in British grammar, so percent is written "per cent," and words will be spelled a bit differently. But the vocabulary is pretty comprehensible.While books like "22 Immutable Laws of Marketing" primarily go into the principles of marketing, and only bring specific companies up as examples in aid to their teaching, "Branding Failures" goes in depth into why the case failed. While the book could have been better, it's still very informative, and it's at least worth a trip to the library.

I love me some R-rated Travolta. In these type of roles, John Travolta tends to run wild, curse like there's no tomorrow, and generally act insane in a fun way. I didn't like The Taking of Pelham 123 that much, but Travolta cursing was certainly a highlight of that movie. And in this movie, he certainly doesn't disappoint. Not only does he curse, but he's bald, he's batcrap crazy AND he's does some great action in this movie! What's not to love about this film? Oh yeah, Jonathan Rhys Meyers.Essentially, most everything relating to Jonathan Rhys Meyers is deadweight. Except, there were a few scenes involving cocaine which were funny. Whether these were intentional, along with a few other scenes in the movie, I don't know, but I got a kick out of them. Problem 1 for Jonathan Rhys Meyers. The movie is from his point of view. Travolta is more interesting, and everytime they cut away from Travolta to Meyers, you're like, "Hey! Hey! No! You get back to Travolta! We don't want to see your face anymore!" Personally, I would have given the script a rewrite, write Jonathan Rhys Meyers out, and give his translation skills to Travolta. Granted, the end of the movie does lean on Jonathan Rhys Meyers heavily, but hey, it can be re-written, and nothing will be lost. Problem 2 for Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He doesn't really do all that much, except for complain much of the time. It's not till a twist in the story is given that he starts manning up, and even then, you have to wait for the last five minutes before his character gets interesting.As for that twist, I could see it coming from a mile away. As soon as they have a scene on the roof, I knew that character wasn't going to make it through the end of the movie, and there was no good to be found in her vicinity.Overall, it's a good rental if you like the finer points of Travolta acting crazy, and there's plenty of decent action to go around, but Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a paper weight that kills any rewatchability. Plus, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is British, and his character talks in an American accent the whole movie. What? Also note, he's not very good at the American accent. Why? He's too British. Well, I suppose he's Irish, but you get the point. Also, I have a problem with the title of the film. Why "From Paris With Love?" What is its significance with the film? It just makes me think of "From Russia with Love!"

I'm man enough to admit I kind of liked the first Twilight film. It provided enough material for me to actively make fun of the film. Plus, THEY LITERALLY SPARKLE! Plus, as soon as I was starting to get bored, there was an "action scene" that was entertaining enough. Sure, it was utter crap, but it was entertaining crap. New Moon on the other hand? Just crap. Essentially, 8 more minutes are devoted to this movie than the last one, and NOTHING HAPPENS!Of course the biggest reveal of the movie is that Native American Jacob is a werewolf. What?!? So, while Edward is away doing Vampire things, Bella falls for Jacob, and they spend a while on that. But, this time is enough for you to say, yeah, Jacob is the better man. He's nicer, he's not trying to push Bella away all the time, he has some acting skills, he looks better shirtless, he doesn't look pale, and he has a better head on his shoulders. Essentially, Jacob is better than Edward in almost every fashion imaginable. I'm Team Jacob, and everybody that's Team Edward is not thinking with their brain. But still, the movie does give us a break from our favorite emo vampire, and I thank if for that. But still, this movie is exceedingly boring. I could go into how horrible the relationships is done, or what as soulless character Bella Swan is, or how heavy-handed the scenes are done, but hey, that's how Twilight rolls. Also note, Chris Weitz, after making The Golden Compass, got sent to director jail by being forced to make this movie, and this guy should never be allowed to direct again. Granted, you can only do so much with the material, but he chooses to do nothing with it. If anything, he makes it more unbearable.Let's get to the "best" parts of the movie, shall we? Ok, the music is pretty good. Granted, they're never used that well in the context of the film, but hey, it's good music. Also, the last act is a throwback to the craziness of the first film. Basically, Edward, being the emo kid that he is, wants to expose himself as a vampire by biting somebody in a pretty Italian town so he basically have himself killed, since he heard the rumor that Bella was dead. Sounds silly? Oh yeah, it is. The scene essentially pulls a "Couples Retreat" since the only reason you have it in the movie is so you can vacation in Italy for a couple of days. Also, poor Michael Sheen. He's not even close to being a great actor, but he's pretty decent, and he's forced to essentially play a more over-the-top Vampire-version of Grima Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings films (That's the character's name, right?). The whole counsel stuff is even more unbearably awful than before, and it's at this point you start praying for sweet death. Then the movie ends with the promise that, "Hey, stuff is actually going to happen in the next movie!" Let's see if they keep this promise, since they've utterly failed so far.Overall, there are very few redeeming features about New Moon, and its plot could have been cut down to 30-40 minutes. To fill up time, you get lengthy scenes of tedious dialogue, longing stares, strange showings of "emotion," and the awful direction of Chris Weitz. Only true Twi-hards love this film and its book, so maybe it's just the material, because I don't know how much more of this I can take.

Move over Chris Tomlin, you're good, but this CD is better. "Stand To Praise" is one of the best praise songs I've heard in a long time. Most of the songs on here are church quality music, and music I wish they would play. But there's some great worship, and some great praise. If it's a good praise and worship CD you want, pass up Tomlin, because you won't be disappointed with this. This is one of the best genre's best talents in a long time.Note: I loved Aaron Shust before the craze. I bought his CD six months before "My Savior, My God" was released on radio. So don't say I ride the waves, I came before the wave. In fact, I created the waves. Alright, that might be an exaggeration.

It's almost impossible to find a good live-action family film that captures magic anymore. From the utterly boring "Water Horse" or the laundry list of fantasy film clones that come out each year. This movie on the other hand is different from the rest. Words like "Clone" and "Boring" don't belong anywhere near this movie. Instead, words like "Original," "Captivating," "Cute," and "Weird" are used. Now, how many family films come anything close to original nowadays? If you're tired of the standard fare, or at least want a new twist to it, look no further.Basically, global warming has wreaked havoc in future Earth, and a brilliant scientist has devised a way to save it, by sending stuffed rabbits and toys to the past, to receive the special item that will save humanity. One of these care packages lands in the hand of two kids, one of whom is already bright (we're never privy as to why), and since they don't know how to keep a secret, trouble soon starts as the toys get feisty, and time starts running out.The cast does a good job with their roles. The kids are cute of course, and they do a very good job. And I might be partial, but Rainn Wilson does a perfect job as his dreaming teacher. His parter also does a good job, and Michael Clark Duncan is fine with what little he's given. The dad, although sometimes nonexistent, whether he's there or not, also does ok. But the mother on the other hand, greatly detracted from the movie for me. I mean, she's half off her rocker, and she's so annoying and emotional and crazed with every half-brained and annoying thing she does. Such an over-reactor, I was like, somebody do a major rewrite of this character. Believe it or not, she's the very low-point of the this very good movie. And it's a tie between her and government for the movie's "villain." I hated her character so much; this movie gets downgraded half a point on my scale.Anyways, the story moves along rather quickly, and the backstory is almost non-existent, but the rest of it certainly keeps you interested and entertained. It's fun to watch these kids have all these cool abilities, and to watch a five-year old girl be smarter than the brightest minds man currently has to offer. You'll certinly get giddy during some of the moments, and you'll feel the emotion and tenseness during other moments. This movie draws you into it, and makes you feel for the girl and her otherworldly bunny. And makes you hate the mother all the more when she agonizingly takes the bunny away.While all these elements make for an excellent film, some might be offended, or further weirded out by the ever-present new age aspects. So present in fact, they ground the story, which might offend parents that are more traditional. Even if it doesn't offend you, it will certainly weird you out.Overall, while some might think the movie is too out in left field, many might take it as the original movie it is. While not perfect, it'll make you wide-eyed, and bring out a sense of wonder, no matter how ridiculous or futuristic the movie might seem. So, next family movie night, pick up this underrated popcorn flick, and prepare for your little ones to become even more attached to their stuffed animal than they already are.Real Score: 4.5By the way, I hated the infinifilm edition of this film. I mean, they can't have all the 30-second special features all grouped together. Nope, you have to search for them by watching the movie all over again. And even when you do find them, they're lame at best. The fact track sucks even worse, giving information that is useless and uninteresting at best. Really, DVD On TV and AMC Enhanced TV is superior at this, and the DVD shouldn't be trying to copy those shows anyhow.

U2 is a legend. And a legend to look up to, because unlike many famous artists, the band crafts great lyrics about peace and love, but then backs it up with their great work in charity. And their legacy continues with this tribute album, where not only do you get great music, but you're contributing to a great cause. For every album sold, Sparrow Records will donate to World Vision to help the AIDS victims in Africa. If there was ever a CD that you had to buy, this would be it. Don't download it illegally, buy it and help World Vision.The big names come out for this one, and the album starts off with one of the band's most famous songs, "Sunday Bloody Sunday." Pillar does a great job with the song, both vocally and musically. Some consider it a hard rock approach, but whatever it is, it works. And the album only gets better with Sanctus Real's cover of "Beautiful Day," one of the more recent U2 hits off the album. Sanctus revs up the song and takes it to it's true potential, making it actually better than the original. Could it be so? Sanctus Real does better than U2? Judge for yourself, but for my money it is.Starfield gets comfortable with "40," and the song's worshipful mood. Many people criticized it, but I think the band did I nice job with it. The now defunct Audio Adrenaline shows off their rock side with "Gloria." Which, amazingly isn't a Christmas song, but musically sounds like the band's cover of "Little Drummer Boy." Overall the band does very well with the song.Sixpence None The Richer, Nicole Nordeman, and Jars of Clay take on U2's lesser known songs, but do well with them, especially Nordeman who gives one of her best performances. These songs however are forgettable nonetheless, since they're the lesser known songs of U2.tobyMac (having done a cover of "40" with dc Talk) this time tackles "Mysterious Ways" with a little help from Sarah Kelly. The song has a electronic undertone, but it comes out well. Another dc Talker does "One." As usual Tait delivers a flawless vocal performance, but again the song is more forgettable, since the original wasn't well known.Delirious? Comes with the hit "Pride" which is dead-on with the original, vocally, musically, everything is a copy of U2. This isn't a cover, it's a copy, and due to the vocal similarities with both bands, I think Delirious? should have been left off the album all together, and the song be given to somebody totally unexpected like Relient K. "With or Without You" is a great performance by, not Grits, but Jadyn Maria (Who?). The song was made for her, and she gives a stellar performance, in fact she's the only one that performs, Grits just does a repeating background vocal. So drop the Grits influence, great song, with Grits, still pretty good.Strangely following the emotional song is "When Love Came To Town," which you probably haven't heard of, but it's not forgettable because Todd Agnew gives his best performance ever with the song. This is his niche, southern rock; he has the voice for it. The song has a great feel to it, and Agnew exceeds all expectations and unexpectedly blows it out of the park.Chris Tomlin continues the trend. "Where The Streets Have No Name" is the most famous U2 song, and it had to be done well, and Chris Tomlin is amazingly the guy to do it. The music, the vocals, the whole feel of the song is just right. It does the original justice. Personally this version is one of my favorite songs of all time.Overall, buy the album. Not only will you get some great music, but you'll be helping a great organization help people. The legacy of U2 is preserved with this album, musically and charitably. Sure I would have liked a couple of minor changes, and maybe add a bonus track of dc Talk's "40" but this is a great album as is, and a must-buy. I got the album for free from this site. Next time I'm at Family Christian Stores, I'll pick up another copy, for the people of Africa, not to sooth a conscience, but because I want to.

I must admit, I love time travel movies, but in the end, most fall short in the subject they're dealing with. They just can't get into their head that if you change one little thing, everything changes. "Next" avoids this problem altogether, by shrinking the margin of travel to two-minutes, for the most part. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.Story: Nicolas Cage's character apparently can see into the future, which is both a blessing and a curse. He can see a bank robbery and a murder before it happens, and prevent it, saving innocent lives. But since the police can't see the future, they take offence at this mysterious magician seemingly punching people for no apparent reason. But he can also avoid them with this ability, which is how he chooses to live his life. But wait... then the darn government agents have to interfere, asking his to stop a nuclear bomb from going off. However, since his ability seemingly can only go two-minutes, he isn't much help. Until he meets a woman that seemingly amplifies his powers to great lengths.Concept: Pretty darn interesting, and original. His powers also evolve over time, making them and character, and for that matter, the movie rather unpredictable. And while the concept is handled rather well, the movie makes it very confusing for viewers that totally aren't mentally into the movie. But think of his powers this way, he basically can go "Groundhog Day" for two-minutes. Rather original, I think.Good Guys: Nicolas Cage is again amazing in the role, and is really perfect for the role, giving the character added depth and emotion. The character therefore is likable, and you feel for him, even though his background information is left completely out of the picture unlike most 'superpower' movies. Jessica Biel does surprisingly well, sure she doesn't blow you out of the water, and the character is pretty cut and paste, she still does fine with it. And even though Peter Falk is listed as one of the main actors, he has all but a few lines, and is more of a cameo.Bad Guys: Julianne Moore shows off her mean side in this film, and while she was never a bundle of joy, she isn't exactly a caring government agent in this film. Exact opposite, while she's doing her job, the character plays good cop sometimes, her only use for Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is too stop the bad guys, which isn't bad, they just bring up some torture questions in the movie, which I personally could have done without. Definitely not the best of roles for Moore.Her partner however could be even worse, not because he's mean or anything, but thank god he only says a few lines, because he's just a downright pathetic and horrible actor to the nth degree. You cringe everytime you hear him speak. Soap-Opera bad doesn't describe it, it's Sci-Fi channel bad. Pathetic, and a real oversight on the director, and Producer Cage. The terrorist on the other hand are pretty bland, and cardboard. But with the main terrorist's name being "Mr. Smith," did you expect anything else?Effects and Action: There's a bunch of "oh snap!" moments in terms of action in this film. Particularly the jumping over the tracks, and totally awesome hill sequence. That was just amazing, until the part at the bottom, where I noticed a couple of effects that looked about ten years old. But other than that, they rarely fail to disappoint. While they aren't exactly blockbuster, they're pretty good considering the rather low budget.The End: Here's the thing, up until this point, I've thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was ready and willing for another half an hour, and it looked as if it was heading in that direction, because that's what happened in every other movie like this. They go through the scenario the first time, screw up, try it again, get it right, happy ending. However, with this movie, you're forced to make up the ending on your own. 'But wait, I'm seeing somebody else's story, so I don't have to make up my own.' Well, if you're that type of person, and most of us are, you won't like the ending at all. But apparently, they didn't have the production budget for it, so they cut the movie about 30 minutes short. Sure you'll feel cheated, sure you'll be angry.Overall, this movie is a rather enjoyable popcorn flick, and a great movie to see on TNT or something. It has a great concept, an interesting story, and good characters. However, all these element have their glaring flaws that mar a otherwise great movie. It's still a good movie, just not great. Also, you have to really pay attention to this movie, because you'll get confused very easily if you don't. Chris's power evolves, and sometimes you don't know what is the future, and what is the present, so sometimes you'll be shocked. But if you do pay attention, the movie is actually improved because of those otherwise confusing elements. And I actually would love a sequel to this movie.

Relient K knows, or knew, how to put out extra content, the EP. The early EPs had songs from the full length albums, as well as some goodies, sometimes good, sometimes not so much. But the trend turns with Apathetic EP, all original content, nothing old.The album starts off with two new studio songs, both are great, but are in a in-between style, not Five Score, but not "Mmhmm" either.The next three songs are marvelous acoustic tracks. All of them are great in their own right. I might prefer the studio version to "Over Thinking" musically, but for the overall emotion to the song, this version works best."In Like a Lion (Always Winter)" is one of the greatest Relient K songs of all time. Although it's not a rock song, it's their best, I guess what you call balled. If you haven't heard the song, please do, you will be blown away. Why this song wasn't on the Music Inspired By The Chronicles Of Narnia album, I don't know. I think it was a MAJOR mistake by the people that produced the album. Because this song is better than that whole album, combined.The last song is by Matt T's side band, Matt Theissen and the Earthquakes. The song is only OK, not anything to write home about. I also had a hard time getting the whole vibe of the song.And for those of you who got the acoustic version of "Who I Am Hates Who I've Been" it's a good version, but I think they took it down too much, which is probably why it was eventually cut.Overall, the best EP by far, great find for fans, and the album contains many great songs. Only time will tell if another EP of theirs is made, this site only mentions a Christmas album coming out, but I hope they do an EP for Five Score. The Relient K EP is always the best middle album in Christian music, and probably music period. You don't have to agree, but it's my opinion, and I'm sticking with it.

This has to be the most original album ever to come out of the circles of Christian music. Take two or three songs, and blend, that's the concept of this album. And surprisingly, it actually works to great effect in most cases.The first song is the best, it is the only song that combines three songs, and it's mixed by the great Tedd T. The song is a great blend, and while SCC's verses are messed up, the problem is easily over looked when looked at a whole with the rest of the song. It's a great blend of rap, and rock. Tracks 2,5,8,9 are also great, expeccially 9.Tracks 3,4,6,7 are tracks that might sound great to another person, but it didn't float my boat. They were OK, but in my mind nothing to write home about. Track 10 is the only track which I can't comment on because of my bias toward Carman, I personally hate the guy. The reasons are personal. So don't ask.Overall, a great concept album, and major props to originality. But, the album was released four years ago, so my only question is, where's the sequel? The some of the songs on the album are classics, but most were hits at the time, and never made it to music memory. I fear a sequel will never be made. Although the public reaction was mostly positive, the critical was terrible, and when you have an album like this, you need the critics to promote sales, and they didn't have that. But, the fans of this album hopefully still have a voice, and a sequel will be made. But till then, we must watch the sky, and pray. You don't have to agree, but it's my opinion, and I'm sticking with it.

The hardest thing for an artist to do is release a greatest hits album. Do you pick fan-favorites? Most successful or popular? Best lyrics? Best music? Band's favorite? Nobody will end up totally happy. With this album, I think the band left out most of the fan-favorites. Where's "The Houseplant Song"? How about their magnificent cover of "Free Ride"? Don't tell me they left out "Clap Your Hands"?Most are great selections for the band. But some of the new songs leave something to be desired. "Goodbye" is your standard goodbye song, maybe a little cliched, but hey, it's a goodbye song. And I thought "Blaze Of Glory" was a cover of the Bon Jovi song, where it came from I don't know, it's a cover of some other group; weird addition. And for those of you who got the special edition, "Down In The Lowlands" is an excellent song. Mark Stuart is spotlighted on this song, and boy does he shine.The DVD portion is also a little lacking, and more for the fans, although they'll feel disappointed. The biggest disappointment is the selection of music videos; it's not the complete collection. They left out videos like "Free Ride". And while "The Story of Audio Adrenaline" is pretty good, and the photo gallery is good, you can't help but wanting more. And they could have done something about it. Again, fans will still like this DVD.Overall, get the special edition if you're going to get the album. If you have the rest of Audio A's albums, download "Down In The Lowlands." It's a must have for any fan. Thanks Audio A, you'll be missed.

Doug Liman seems to have done nothing but freefall since The Bourne Identity, which was five stars. Then he did Mr. and Mrs. Smith, (4 stars), and now he's done this wannabe (3 stars). I don't even want to know how the sequel is going to turn out, although it has the potential to be a whole lot better. Anyways, this movie has a great concept of teleportation, used in sort of a anti-hero and selfish manner. Add a girl that was better off out of the picture, and you have a somewhat entertaining disappointment.Hayden Christensen, while no Oscar winner, isn't as bad most would have you believe, but on the other hand, you almost never see his true colors because they're hidden under boring, one-dimensional and whiny characters. And that's what this character is, boring, one-dimensional, whiny and just plain dumb. In fact, Jamie Bell's Griffin is a whole lot more exiting, experienced, has his act together, has no girlfriend dragging him down, and he's just plain cooler. A movie centered around that character would have made for a much more interesting movie. Hopefully, he'll be around in sequals as an ally.But the main problem with the movie comes in the form of Samuel L. Jackson, who gets his revenge from Hayden kicking his butt in Star Wars, and in turn shocks everybody, and stabs them with a knife that probably has a deleted scene to explain its strange mysteriousness. Or maybe it's just bad filmmaking. Anyways, Sam Jackson and his group of Jumper killers are so over the top, Evil Knievel couldn't jump over it. Sam Jackson especially. He's just so evil, he's beyond evil, not believable, and again, over the top.Then there's the "twist" of Diane Lane, which is not only disappointing but confusing. She's a bad guy? Now, any path they take with her character is going to be so muddled a Hummer couldn't get through it. Then there's the girlfriend, who seems pretty cardboard, and who I never could quite get into. She isn't bad lookin', but her character development seems rather predictable, and again, boring.But for all those wrongs about this movie, there is also plenty of good ones. The prologue is interesting and does a good job setting up the character, although Hayden's narration does get annoying after the first time. Then there's the action. Ahhh yes, the action. The action is entertaining, interesting, and pretty darn cool. My personal favorite was when they brought the London bus to the Egyptian desert.So overall, you have a excellent concept and tons of potential. Unfortunately, this potential doesn't formulate into much thanks to poor writing, bad characters, over the top bad guys, questionable casting, and way too many lulls, both intended or otherwise. I look forward to a sequel, where hopefully they'll make it an action film. It won't have much depth to it, but as long as there's no lulls it should be pretty entertaining at least.

Basically, Brandon Fraser's getting kicked out of his college lab (SNL's Seth Meyers makes a great appearance), Brandon's nephew spends vacation with him before moving to Ottawa (I prefer Toronto), the two go volcano hunting in Iceland (none of my uncles would have ever spent the money to take me to Iceland)... Ahhh who cares, it's all just an excuse to for some 3D action! But let me warn you, DO NOT GET THIS IN STANDARD DEFINITION! Why?Because this movie looks stunningly beautiful in awesome in Blu-Ray, and it just adds so much to the experience. In SD, it's a sub-par experience, because the movie was made for HD, and of course 3D, but with those paper red/blue 3D glasses, I only noticed a substantial 3D effect during the credits. During the movie, the action just moves too fast, and your color is all distorted. So unless you have a really good pair of glasses, you might want to skip that. But you'll still have the picture and the action. It's a throwback to those Saturday matinee serials where things jump out, scare you, and surprise you. Things blow up, explode, collapse, and the action and adventure is certainly entertaining. Good family fun, although the little ones may find some of it a bit too intense.Overall, don't even consider the SD version as you'll only come out disappointed. HD on the other hand makes all the difference, and it makes the movie that much better. Sure the plot is nothing to write home about, but the family and I had a very fun time with this popcorn flick. And I'm very open to a sequel, if it's filmed in the same manner. An Atlantis plot is especially intriguing.Real Score: 4.5

I first heard Mr. Wright on 90.5 Spirit FM in Tampa, Florida when I was living in nearby Lakeland. I was going through one of the most difficult times in my life, and I remember walking around my quiet suburban neighborhood praying while listening to "You're Beautiful". This song and Shawn McDonald's "Gravity" helped me get through a tough period in my life. After listening to a few other songs off the record, I decided to support the artist that helped me through.The aforementioned song is as it's name says, beautiful. A magnificent song, and easily the top song of 2003. Paul brings emotion into his songs like no-one else. This is probably best showcased in "Mommy, Where's Daddy?", which apparent to it's title, is about the effects of separation on a child. Wright weaves a delicate balance of being emotional, but keeping your attention the entire time.The great thing about Mr. Wright is that he can't be fit into a genre. This album has them all, pop, hip-hop, rap, reggae, worship, acoustic rock, and various other styles. The great part? They all work. Another great thing? They're fusioned. In the case of "Your Love Never Changes", which is rap and pop, it works brilliantly. "Rock The Show" is another great upbeat dance tune, sure to rock your socks off dancing, the Lightheaded re-mix is even better.And even though he's from Seattle, Paul has a heavy beach influence about him, as showcased in "South Beach" and "Flip Flops". I don't know of anybody else that does the types of songs that Mr. Wright does, and if they do, I'm willing to bet they don't do it as well.The rest of the songs are excellent. In fact, this whole album is like a rare bunch of bananas, the type that is totally ripe, and every last bite is as flavorful and savory as the first. Don't believe me? Buy it for yourself. Mr. Wright is an underrated fresh blend in the world of Christian music. A musical smoothie sure to delight. This in my book is one of the top 3 debuts of all time. And it's one of the tops in my CD collection. I hope it will be yours too.

From the opening track and probable highlight of "I Want To Save You" you know there's something different about Jack's Mannequin frontman, Andrew McMahon's pop-punk/piano rock project. Even though it has all the trademarks of a pop-punk record, it carries with it a natural maturity because of McMahon and his piano, which really makes the album and differs it from the rest of its competition. This is really shown in the honest piano ballads of "Cavanaugh Park" and "Globes & Maps." And the album also surprises you musically, as seen in "Straw Dog."That doesn't mean it's all great however, with the profanity-laced "If You See Jordan" and fun, but the cliched "Drunk Girl." But, the good parts like explosive "Not What It Seems" all but make up for it. So overall, even with a couple of missteps, it's still a classic album for the genre, and really showcases the underrated talent of Something Corporate and Andrew McMahon. For people who have never heard of the band, I would describe Something Corporate as a power-rock version of The Fray. So for pop-punk/rock/piano rock fans, it doesn't get too much better than this cult classic.

Going into this movie, I was either expecting to get hit over the head with the atheist book of nothingness, or sit through a torturous movie that defines why the fantasy genre should just give up now. And while I did not get hit over the head, nor was I tortured, I was just bored. And yes, the fantasy genre just keeps sinking lower with every copycat that tries to make a fast buck with a big budget. Really people, not every "bestselling" book that has the genre of fantasy should be made into a movie.The story and mythology had me more confused then that time when I woke up on the moon, then realized it was just a dream. And if confusing wasn't enough, it was just plain weird. I mean, everybody except the polar bears and the witches had an animal following them all over the place, which was somehow connected to their soul or whatever, and these animals were called "demons." Which is even more confusing since the demons or witches in the movie aren't really "demons" or "witches."The visual effect and action are what really keep the movie on its feet though. The "Steam-Punk" look of the cities, and the sheer magnificence of the backgrounds are sure to impress. In terms of action, to add to more confusion, the fight between polar bears, reminded me a lot of the fight between Peter and King Miraz from Narnia 2, in the fact that it didn't excite me, and tended to lean boring, since it was fight for the sake of fight, for fight's sake.But don't let cute, almost Narnian look of this movie fool you, this is not for kids at least under 13, because you will scare the crap out of them, and even kids under 10-13 will have a hard time processing the film's more tense moments, and the sheer evality of the villains.However, the film does deliver in the climax when Lyra escapes from the "experiment" proceeds to blow up the place, then run into a battle with a bunch of Russin lookin' characters with swords. And although it would have been a lot cooler if the Polar Bear brought his army to the battle, but hey, I'll take what I can get from this film. The battle offers the film's most exiting moments, and actually shows a glimpse of hope of a good movie.The casting is rather good. Whether the cast was used to their full potential is another thing. Sam Elliot is great in his role, as is Nicole Kidman. The girl who played Lyra was good and kept you interested. But the voice cast on the other hand was thrown away. They were all interchangeable, and could have, and probably should have worked with lesser known actors portraying the roles, since no voice performance really stood out, or was in the least bit memorable. And even though Daniel Craig was put as a featured star, he was in the film for all of five minutes. Christopher Lee on the other hand could have had 30 seconds.Fortunately, this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, instead of the 2 hours it could have been. Unfortunately, this movie banked way too much on having sequels, so the ending is hanging off a cliff with 1 finger. It offers no satisfaction, and it makes you wait for a sequel that probably will never come now. I mean, nothing is really resolved, except for a couple of side-quests. No bad guys are killed, and nothing is really done.And to make matters worse, the credits song takes the award for WORST credits song of all time. It's a lazy effort with pathetic lyrics that has the musical-quality of singing rocks. And frankly, singing rocks is a lot more entertaining.Random Rant: I was disappointed that the polar bear didn't drink Coke at any point in the movie, and Coke didn't have any advertising campaign associated with the movie that I can remember.And although I have not, and will not read the source material, I'm glad they didn't stick to it. The movie was made better for me because I didn't feel like I was being preached at, although I expected to be. And while watching the movie, you don't feel like you're being whacked over the head with some atheistic crap. Sorry to offend all you people that believe in nothing, which is something (confusing I know), but Philip Pullman is the most offensive thing this side of a Nas record.So overall, while this movie does have its moments; they are few and far between. Between the moments are a lot of information that flies over your head, a story that doesn't make much sense, and plot-turns and side-quests that are there just for the sake of being there, and don't really make sense. I don't care if the movie is congruent with the book, just give me a good movie.

When I first saw the pilot, I thought the show was visually striking, humorous, and most importantly, original. This feeling continued for the rest of the season, which was unfortunately cut off due to the writer's strike. I eventually gave the season 5 stars and named it one of the best shows on today. Then, 6 months later, the show came back, and for the first 4 or 5 episodes, it continued this streak. That is until the quirk the show had bottled was run dry and instead the show tried to hard with its wacky storylines and characters. Add to that some romantic subplots, daddy issues, and other messy writing, and the show quickly outgrew its welcome.Again, the show was not cancelled prematurely, but it just ran its course way too quickly. Not the fault of ABC, but the fault of the writers and the creator. It's not enough that the show was so out of whack it didn't appeal to a mainstream audience, but by losing the quirk, they lost me and a lot of other fans of the show. Hopefully, the cast will find success in the future because they did a great job, but because of the end, I will probably forget this show sooner than it deserves.

If you drink coffee, than you know Starbucks. I personally hate the company, and drink for that matter. But if you've ever been in a Starbucks, then chances are you've heard their background music. That's Hear Music, Starbuck's own music brand who just released the new Paul Mcartney CD, and released the famous last Ray Charles duet album. The brand often releases "Unplugged" or acoustic versions of popular AC songs, i.e. Alanis Morrisote, Oh how I hate her.This is the Christian's Hear Music album. A great CD to drink coffee to, or just read a book and relax.Note: This is not a live album, it's just unplugged in front of a select audience of maybe 50 people. This is not what a Jeremy Camp concert looks like, there's no orchestra or conductor behind him.Now that we have that out of the way, let's explore the quality of the album. Underrated is the word. Nobody liked the album because they thought it was "Live", so nobody bought it. But get the album's true art, and you'll love it. The album is an acoustic masterpiece. Every song is given a new layer, and many times improved upon. This is most evident when his wife sings with him as background vocals, nothing short of stellar.The only problem is I wish it was longer, more songs. But overall, the album is truly an underrated classic work of art. The DVD is also a great bonus, totally adds to the album and music. The video work is very well done, and is award winning quality. So go into the album expecting a Starbucks style album, and you'll like what you hear, and want more.

The trailer for this movie is certainly one of the best to come around in a long while, peaking my interest in the movie. However, once the reviews came pouring in, I was worried, and decided to wait for Blu-Ray. So is the worry for nothing, or is it justifiable? Well, while some of the reviews were a bit over the top, 'the plot comes to a halt in a scene involving a kitchen utensil.' Really, it's not that exiting, and no, none of the main characters die. The curve is out of left-field, but I moved with it and continued on. The plot doesn't come to a halt, it just changes in tone, since we already got past the drunken hero part. If it hadn't gone in the direction it did, it just would have become too cliched.With Will Smith in a movie, you expect heavy on the action and comedy, and Smith doesn't disappoint yet again. It's a 4th of July blockbuster for gosh's sakes! You've scene parts of most of these scenes in the trailer, and it's even better in the movie. The magnitude of the drunken-idiot-efforts of Hancock is incredible. And as always, Will Smith is great per usual, as is Jason Bateman. Charlize could have been casted better, but no big deal, as she still looks good after all these years.However, there are two problems with this movie. First, if you're not doing an origin movie, then implement flashbacks. Otherwise, there's too much dialogue explaining, which naturally leave plot holes, and you saying "What the heck?" With proper use of flashbacks, you can eliminate this, and keep the plot moving. Secondly, while Peter Berg does a decent job, they could have gotten somebody better, as the movie carries a largely out-of-place arthouse feel with the camera work. In this case, a normally straight drama director doesn't work here, especially a movie introducing a character. If they had done these two things, then the movie could have been five stars. Otherwise, it's a four.Overall, in this case, it's just best to decide for yourself and see the movie. You're either going to love it, or kinda love it. It could have been a lot better, but it could have been a lot worse, and it brings a hefty dose of originality to the genre. Just keep in mind, the trailer is probably better than the movie. I am however already lining up for a much-needed sequel.

The genre of Pop/Punk is very crowded i.e. Relient K, Stellar Kart. In this genre, bands like Eleventyseven were lost in the crowd, so they totally changed their sound. The result is an amazing CD that might not be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it's original."Love In Your Arms" is probably the highlight of the CD, and like the rest of the CD it is a great ringtone song. I mean the rock mixed with electronic is something never heard in CCM. The new sound is continued in "Happiness," but only every once in a while. The band has matured enough to keep things interesting and catchy throughout the whole album. "How It Feels (To Be With You)" is a well crafted song that builds up interest until unleashing on the chorus, satisfying to the utmost."It's Beautiful" is a great radio acoustic song, and it really shows the band's maturity. The lowlight is "12 Step Programs" which isn't bad, it just doesn't have the feel of the rest of the album, and feels out of place. "Conan" on the other hand is a great candidate for best pop culture reference song of the year. I first thought the song was about Conan The Barbarian, but it's actually Conan O' Brien (the guy who's taking over the Tonight Show). I won't spoil the lyrics, but they'll make you laugh. And the most surprising thing is they haven't been a guest on the guy's show. I mean they make a song about him, and he doesn't even care.My personal favorite song off the album is "Galaxies Collide," a heavy electronic song in the style of HelloGoodbye, in that it's a electronic voice lovesong. The chorus is great, and the music is the most refreshing in years.Overall, a must-have for anybody looking for original Christian music. The style is great and Eleventyseven have really found their niche. I mean, nobody else does it, and they do it perfectly. I would love to see the style throughout their next album, but this is one of my favorites for the year.The genre of Pop/Punk is very crowded i.e. Relient K, Stellar Kart.

When the band made their debut in 2000, you could hear the crickets chirp. The album was evidently written by teens, which is forgivable if you grew up in the 80's, but the rest of us didn't get it. Nancy Drew, Matchbox 20, Marilyn Manson, Back to the Future, Charles in Charge, and 17 Magazine--all referenced in the music--made focal points of the songs. While some are amusing and witty, "`It's three a.m.,' she said. `Who are you Matchbox 20?'"Other references are irritating and utterly pointless. The vocals lack, and while glimpses of tune are visible, most are simply forgettable. "Softer to Me", the highlight is an edgy rock song that croons the plea, "Life could you be a little softer to me. ... This world is hard, it's cruel, and I wish it could be ... softer to me."Overall, the album is amusing to a degree, but it's juvenile, and this all but murders the album's good points. Even the band admits they hate it.

First off, how come it took this long to get a song about Myspace? The song is terrible like the site, but hey, at least they did a song about the site.Eleventyseven is another one of those bands that my younger sister would love, but not a more mature person. I mean really, if you've heard one song off this album, you've heard them all. Listen to "More Than A Revolution", you've heard the album. Unless I just happened to miss a song, which is possible since I fell asleep.The whole thing screams Jonas Brothers quality, from the immature voice, from the lyrics, to a sad excuse for punk music, this album is a good one to give to your little brother. Thinking of the album for yourself? Don't bother.Note: I've heard "It's Beautiful", and it sounds like the band will take a giant leap musically in the next album. We can only hope. The album cover looks awesome anyways.

At times The Day the Earth Stood Still is an interesting sci-fi, and at other times it's like shaving yourself with a cheese grater. The story is an after-thought at best, the action is few and far between, and the by the end I did not find myself attached to any of the characters, except for the fact that I liked the actors themselves i.e. Jon Hamm. But wait, SPOILER WARNING -- Jon Hamm dies for no particular reason -- SPOILERS ENDED!However, by far the worst element of the film is the sheer annoyingness of Kathy Bates and Jaden Smith's characters. These characters darn near ruined the film with their sheer unbelievability, irrationality, and especially in the case of the kid, the endless whining! URRGHHH! Keanu Reeves is good, but he's playing an emotionless character... Take that comment how you like.What do I blame this poor quality on? The lack of experience of the director/writer, whose only credits are The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Last Castle. WTH? The studio heads entrusted such a huge movie to a director with little prior experience, and no real foreseeable talent? The result is a movie that's best reduced down to the trailer, because the movie is mostly a time waster. Why does it get two stars? Gort's the best part of the movie, and pretty darn cool... Even though he sets the end of the world in motion...Did I also mention that the reason humanity apparently deserves this fate in the eyes of the aliens is because we didn't take care of the environment, and the only reason we're spared is based on the promise that we'll change? Yeah, it's pretty bad.

Carrie Underwood is the godess of country, bigger than Reba, bigger than Dolly, in fact, she's the biggest girl in country, period. And it all started with not some hearts, but with six million hearts. "Jesus Take The Wheel" is a good song, but I am now tiring of it after constant replays of the song on radio, on the multiple formats the song apeals to, including country, christian, and others."Before He Cheats" on the other hand is not for families, as the song is about beating the heck out of an ex's car. As appealing as that sounds, it isn't very nice, but it helped her sell a good portion of her albums. The rest of the songs on the album are OK, typical country fare. So, if you don't like country, you won't like this CD. With the exception of the title track, which is good top 40 material. One of the highlights I liked from the album was the one about her hometown, which was also the only one where she actually wrote a song off her album, and it's the highlight. Connection?After 6-million albums sold, what do you expect me to say? It's the most groundbreaking album of all time? No, I don't even think it's that in the circles of country, it's close, but not there. This is only a debut album after all. Carrie as a singer is great, and some of her values are good, but a song about a revenge on a cheating boyfriend taints the album from getting my vote. You don't have to agree, but it's my opinion, and I'm sticking with it.

If you want an action movie you can awe at and lose yourself in, then Eagle Eye is your ticket. If you're looking for serious and realistic movie that's meant to give you a debate on big brother government and terrorist tactics, then go get 'The Bourne Ultimatum.' This movie on the other hand is a tense action thriller that keeps you guessing, and some true jaw-dropping scenes. It's almost non-stop movement, and it's movement that keeps you on your edge. Make no mistake about it, Eagle Eye is an action thriller.Story-wise, Shia LaBeouf is a slacker that works in a 'Copy Cabana,' who strives for independence, even though he's not very good at it. Michelle Monaghan is a somewhat happy single mother who just sent her son of to play trumpet at the Lincoln Center. Then all the sudden, Julianne Moore calls them their cellphones, and even gives directions on random TV and various other electronic screens, and she won't take voicemail or no for an answer. As it turns out, she does not want pizza, but rather intends to guide them to Washington DC to carry out an elaborate conspiracy. Oh, did I mention some anti-terrorist government officials are after them?On its surface, the premise of Eagle Eye is actually quite compelling, and keeps your attention throughout the movie. It's only about 3/4s through I started noticing it shared some similarities to Will Smith's 'I-Robot.' In either case, while some parts may be original, the overall story really isn't, but again, this isn't the type of movie you dissect like that. Sure, it calls into question terrorism methods, and spying, but that's not the point of the movie. The point of the movie is to have a good time. And not to give too much away, I'd rather Shia's character kick the bucket at the end, sacrificing his life, as it could have made for a strong movie all the way around.But overall, Eagle Eye is a great popcorn flick, and a conspiracy action thriller. The cast does a great job, the crew does a nice job, the story keeps you interested, and the action is jaw-dropping sequence after sequence. Rent it, buy it, it's a great watch. Just don't over-think it.

What's the selling point of RED? Stars you like doing stuff you like, mainly shooting things. At this, the film does very well. And fortunately, the things it doesn't do very well don't detract from the film that much.Granted, the plot is incomprehensible, and the supposed twists at the end will have you thoroughly scratching your head, but most of the main plot points at least have an interesting action setpiece surrounding it. Also, I had a big problem with Morgan Freeman in this film, as he gets second billing, but is in the film a grand total of 10 minutes. He's good during those 10 minutes, but it's little more than a glorified extended cameo, since he doesn't really factor into much of anything very much. I mean, was he too busy filming Thick as Thieves or any of the other myriad straight-to-dvd trash he's been involved with in the past decade? Sorry, just had to get those off my chest.Still, RED mostly makes it up with a great cast and creative action. It's hard to tell what Bruce Willis phoning in a performance is anymore, but here he's just Bruce Willis, and the results are pretty nice. He's still believable as an elite assassin type who can best men half his age, and he pulls the romantic aspects of the plot fine as well. Which brings me to Mary-Louise Parker who while I've never been a particular fan of, does a good job as the cute government customer service girl dragged into this crazy conspiracy. She's charming and funny, and while she isn't exactly asked to do a lot, she does a very good job with what she has. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are appropriately cute together. Karl Urban sounds exactly like Dr. McCoy as a CIA agent, but he's actually quite likable despite some of the more cliched aspects of his character.Still, none of them quite reach the level of John Malkovich having a helluva good time as the LSD-dosed paranoid agent who serves about 85% of the comedic beats of this action comedy. He really gives a lot to the role, giving the appropriate amount of crazy to make this character, who at one point charges at the Vice-President with a fake bomb strapped to him, really funny and memorable. He has a lot of great lines, he has some good action beats, and he's given a lot of great stuff to play off of, mainly his pink pig.As for the action, it has a lot of creative over-the-top sequences, never too far apart, to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. There's the awesome Bruce Willis stepping out of a moving/spinning car while shooting a guy scene, but the scene taking place with a bunch of cargo crates probably takes the cake. It's fairly short, but it exemplifies everything to like about the movie. There's general craziness (using a gun as a bat to toss back a live grenade), very creative and satisfying moments (the grenade launcher hitting the first guy was particularly great), and then of course you have the explosions and a good Malkovich one-liner to top everything off.Overall, if you know what to expect, and it's really not that hard to know, you should have a pretty enjoyable time watching a bunch of older actors kick butt. It's pretty accessible to most anybody if you want a good date movie, action movie or comedy, and judging by the reaction in my theater audience, it's also quite the crowd-pleaser. So, if you want a bunch of Retired, but Extremely Dangerous people to invade your screen for a good time, put in RED.

"Run" is a great song. Unfortunately the rest of the album is just a bad rock album. Nothing interesting, nothing new, nothing that strikes you as good. So a bad debut for Kutless, which makes since since self-titled albums usually turn out bad anyways. Relient K, Kutless, Lifehouse, all turned out bad. This is no exception.

Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way "Toys" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named "Evil Peel," and gets to say the line, "You just saved me from myself." Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the "funnier" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.

First off, great value, great price, and great that it comes with the 100 CD's I really need for all my computing and media needs, especially since it takes me 10 of these to backup my computer fully. And like I said, 9 out of 10 work great, especially when I'm burning a music CD. However, when play back that 10th CD, I've come to find that at least one of the tracks has a defect in them. It's not the music, or the burning method, or the user, it's the CD. But for the price, it's still a great buy. And I highly recommend it, just watch out for that 10th CD.

Moving from the apparently monotonous punk/pop, New Found Glory decided it was best to move into the more mature varied pop/rock sound. Emphasis is placed on music and lyrics of it all, instead of solely on the music. Add in some incredibly catchy tunes and a relatively lite atmosphere, and you have a winner of an album.The best part about this album is that it's a music chocolate box, where you never really know what you're going to get, like the rock ballad, "Boulders" or the pure power pop excellence of "Connected," which ranks as the highlight. The best is every song has something to give, and it's hard to find a bad one in the bunch. You have your normal radio-friendly tracks like, "Hold My Hand," and the acoustic, poppy "Too Good To Be" but it all comes off great. The album also never disappoints, moving from track to track.Truly one of the highlights of the genre, and probably the band's best album (although "From the Screen To Your Stereo Vol. 1" ranks up there). It never fails to disappoint giving 50 minutes of varietal and enjoyable listening. A great soundtrack to summers everywhere, it may be more mature, but that just means they've gotten better since the last time around.

Jeremy comes full circle with this album, sure his first two albums were good, but they weren't great. The precedent is set with the first track, "Restored" , great modern rock, with even better lyrics. The great thing here is that Jeremy builds up to the chorus, and then delivers without disappointment. The lyrics only get better with "Take You Back", his big radio hit, and for good reason. This song sings God's promise to us take back his prodigal sons.Even slower songs like, "Even When", "Be The One" and "This Man" are nicely crafted, and don't get boring for one second.And did I mention his rock tracks? "Lay Down My Pride" is unique in that it starts slowly in the verses but then it quickly amps up when it hits the chorus. Great track, easily a highlight. My personal favorite is "Breathe", a track that rockets off, and never slows down.The only lowlight is "My Desire", which has great lyrics, but I think it could have been executed better musically, although the background vocals by his wife are excellent. Overall, it's all uphill for Jeremy. He waded through the waters of the debut album, and suffered through the sophomore slump, but walks on water with this album. My love for Jeremy is restored, as if it was ever gone in the first place, after all, that's is a GREAT first name. Jeremy, I like the sound of it.

Going into this movie, I was expecting a mediocre and boring piece of film which would fall into the cracks of movies never to return again. Instead, it's like one of those strange 80's fantasy films which didn't fit into the whole feel of the day, but holds enough charm to one day become a backwoods classic. Think "Labyrinth" and other such movies. And contrary to the opinion of so many ravingly insane and stalker-like fans, this movie isn't half-bad.I don't know where all the "Star Wars" comparisons were coming from, except for that suspicious sunset scene. But anyways, this felt a lot like Lord of The Rings. And that's what this movie aspires to be, with the Peter Jackson like pans of the journey over breath-taking landscapes. Who know Hungry could look that good?So while this movie doesn't exactly do anything new, I didn't really expect it to be, when all fantasy works steal off each other anyway. This movie is a combination of those Tolkienesque quest epics, and those dragon movies which never seemed to strike a chord with audiences. See that's 90's dragon movie whose name I can't think of, and that Christian Bale evil dragon film which I kinda liked.Another bad point to this movie is just the poor choice of director and writer. If you're going to do a big movie like this, don't give it to a first-timer. And as for writer, let's just say it's fun to guess what the character is going to say, before they actually say it. Fun game.As for characters, Eragon is likeable, yet immature and stupid. Jeremy (love that name) Irons does the best with what he is given. And the girl, what can I say, she doesn't look half-bad. But here's a question while we're at it. Is all Elvish the same? Do Lord of The Rings Elves, and Eragon Elves speak the same language? And why do they sound so different from Santa Clause Elves?Anyways, the bad guys on the other hand, are pretty bad, mean, cardboard, evil, and you wish for them to go away, in a bad way. And those soldiers sure seem a lot like Orcs. Here's another question. Why did Rachel Weiz lose her English accent for her dragon role? I didn't even know it was her.But onto the good points. The action, while not original, is entertaining. The sword fights are cool, and the battles, while not exactly impressive, are interesting. The story, while not original, is interesting, and mostly keeps your attention. It also avoids the ugly fate of Golden Compass, by keeping down the confusing mythology. Although they could have cut down on the Elvish a little bit.But for the best part of the movie, let's give a round of applause for the director. Because I thank him for keeping the movie a little more than an hour and a half. Not 3 hours, not 2 hours. Just a nice little hour and a 38 minutes. But although this is a very nice running time, the director could have easily cut down many scenes to make this a true 1 hour and a 1/2.Overall, while not exactly original or brilliant, it's Lord of The Rings light. It keeps you interested throughout the whole movie, it has some cool sequences, and some characters are pretty likeable. And again, I like the running time. So don't listen to the crazed and mentally unstable fanatics of the much-overrated book, this movie could have been a whole lot worse.Real Score: 3.5

"Me And Jesus" is the best track on the album, with great lyrics, and the passion behind the song. Bad thing is the rest of the album falls into it's own formula, and one that you tire of VERY fast. Stop after five tracks, you've heard the basic sound. Creatively is badly needed on this album, change up the formula. The next album should be a complete departure from their first two albums, do hard rock, or no rock. Do something different. This isn't a sophomore slump, because their first album wasn't much better.

In the late 80s, when "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" is ruling the radio, a war is going on in Europe, and when this volatile pot starts boiling, it somehow moves to America. At first, in only starts on Ellis, Governor's, and Liberty Island, but it then those sneaky Reds come ashore in Seattle and start wreaking havoc. Unfortunately, the only ones who are there to defend the area just got back from a tiring tenure in Europe. What follows is a desperate attempt to keep those pesky Commies at bay, and protect the homeland. Story-wise, I have no problems except for the fact that the game doesn't present it in chronological order, leaving you to only know the backstory halfway through the game.To keep the story going are a series of animated movies in-between the missions to give the character an effective sense of realness, which they succeed at, and the excellent narrative provided by the best Baldwin Brother, Alec. The result are characters and a story that you care about, and voice work that is by no-means shoddy. I would have rather had the animation for the movies and characters a little less hand-drawn, but they serve their purpose.The gameplay itself is interesting, with missions taking 40-70 minutes per mission, which I would have liked shortened, and during the course of each mission, you're given objectives like 'defend the gas station,' or 'take the fort.' This mostly results in your ragtag group of soldiers taking and defending circles. Simple yes, but what did you expect?During offence objectives, you'll travel to circles infested with Commie soldiers and tanks, and you'll wipe them out. In defence objectives, you go to the circle, and wait 5-10 minutes till your men have wiped out the oncoming force, or you retreat, which you seem to do alot. Defence provides the most interesting action, because you mostly sit back and watch your men impressively take out the hardened Commie force. While on offence, you'll be so busy plotting your best course of action, you'll mostly miss the action. You also tend to stay rather busy, moving and telling troops to attack, gathering reinforcements, and directing your aerosol of air force, creating an impressive array of destruction of every sort.The graphics also never fail to impress. You can take the omniscient point of view over the whole battlefield, or you can zoom in to see the details on your soldier's faces, and the detail in your tanks. The only problem is that with all this action happening, and rather large maps on top of that, my computer had a very hard time keeping up. The machine is by no means old, with it running perfectly on Call of Duty 4, but this moved painfully slow for me, camera included. Troops took forever to get places, it took forever to get in badly needed air support, and so on. Just be warned, your system better be pretty up to date to handle the magnitude of this game.Overall, with a well-thought out story, characters you care about, a well-placed soundtrack, interesting gameplay, impressive action and equally impressive graphics, this game has too many a pro for you not to consider adding to your own arsenal. It does have a few cons, but these are mostly minor. World In Conflict is a surprisingly effective game, and I'd recommend it to anybody that loves these types of games. I would love a sequel, and somebody should seriously consider a first-person shooter prospective to this scenario. And don't forget to turn up your speakers during the credits!Real Score: 4.5

Alright, I loved the regular edition, but didn't own it. So this comes out, and I pay seven bucks for three more songs that what I would have gotten. I wish I would have gotten the regular edition. Because this is a pathetic excuse for a special edition, in fact, it's just plain lazy.You get three "New" songs, I had high hopes for "We Exalt Thee". Kutless just got lazy on it. It could have been so much more, it could have been a great worship moment. What do you get instead? Awkwardness. I thought "My Savior, My God" was a cover of Aaron Shust's hit. It isn't, I don't know where it came from, but it's very poorly done. The singing is bad, and the retention of the song is a little under two seconds, but not much less. The last song? The live version of "Strong Tower" that was from the live CD, which Kutless fans already have.Overall, a useless, pathetic, lazy excuse for a special edition. Get the regular edition, because this is just plain embarrasing.

This is a great release by Kutless, their best by far. In a world where the worship genre has the depth of the kiddie pool, this is a great breadth of fresh air. The original songs aren't that great, so the Kutless written part still isn't that good. But the covers are moving to say the least. When I listened to their version of "Word Of God Speak" I fell to the floor in adoration. Now I've never done that before with any worship song, ever! So this CD is very powerful."Take Me In" is also very powerful, and one I would like to see integrated into worship services in churche. However this version is great until the forth go-around, then it gets repetitive. "We Fall Down" is another great worship song.Overall, underrated. Most people didn't like it because there wasn't enough original material, when I actually think that that's a good thing. A very powerful worship album, and definitely one worth buying.

If you need a movie that doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, that's also a pure action movie, then you've just described G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra perfectly. Coming from Director Steven Sommers, who after 'Van Helsing' stopped taking himself seriously, doesn't really take anything seriously in this movie. There is a plot, that tries to take itself seriously, but towards the middle of the movie I think it just gives up and throws in Cobra's story every once and a while. And yes, if you try to give the bad guys motivation, 9 times out of 10 it fails, and watching this film it's a 4 out of 4.Channing Tatum, that "cute" guy with the Army haircut takes on the burden of playing G.I. Joe, sure, it's technically an organization, but he's basically an action figure in this movie, and his acting attests to that. But even with all this, I did find his character somewhat interesting in that he's this super soldier, but no matter what he does he's a screw-up. He tries to help his friend, his face gets Vadarized. He tries to save the Eiffel Tower, it's partially intact when it topples over and kills a ton of people. If the filmmakers care about character development in the sequel, this feature to the character would be very interesting to expand on. The rest of the Joe team is pretty good, but a little unmemorable. Except in a bad way for Marlon Wayans, who stayed away from his brothers' crappy movies, but gets saddled with all these awful jokes. Also, even though Dennis Quaid is shown in all the trailers and is given high billing, he mails it in for all of the five minutes he's there.But wait, then there's Snake Eyes. Channing Tatum is the "star" of this film, but Snake Eyes is the most bad-a** dude here. First, he doesn't talk because he's taking a lifelong vow of silence, and he's an awesome fighter. Really, some of his sword-fighting sequences are some of the best I've seen in years. Even the child version of him is kicks butt. Snake Eyes looks cool, gets the job done, and is the film's breakout character.Action-wise, it's like a best-of summer action films. There's chases in vehicles, underwater, in the air, with swords, with guns, with fists & feet. Did I miss any? Basically if you ask what kind of action this film has, I say all the above. For the most part, all of it works, it's all pretty cool, and it never overstays its welcome. Also, at home Blu-Ray & an awesome home theater system will mean everything to this movie, and it increases the experience ten-fold. And yes, perhaps the film's best sequence, and one of the best action sequences I've seen in a while is the Paris chase with the accelerator suits. It's incredibly self-indulgent with slow motion, but I loved every minute of it.There are also two great unique elements to the movie I found enjoyable.1. The movies makes very heavy use of the flashback sequence to give the backstory for all the main characters, and while it does slow it down some because there's not really any action to them, I applaud the effort and I found them pretty engaging.2. Having seen a lot of these future technology weapons on the History Channel, it's pretty cool seeing the movie making heavy use of this advanced technology working the way it would really work, and not a Hollywood version of it. Somers says all the tech will be in use in 20 years, and I highly doubt it, but it's cool to see these futuristic weapons grounded in reality for once.Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, the action-phile I am, and it's a great way to lose two hours. It never loses it's welcome, and it provides a lot of satisfactory bones thrown to the audience. It never takes itself seriously, as it shouldn't, and you shouldn't either, because you'll wind up disappointed. For the G.I. Joe fans, if you're a fans of 60s/70s Joe, it's in name only unless you count the scar on Channing Tatum. As for the 80s cartoon Joe fans, you'll most likely find yourself highly pleased since the movie takes most of its universe from the cartoon series.

With the passing of the late and not-so great George Carlin, the baton in my mind has now officially been passed onto the culinary rat from the Pixar film, Patton Oswalt. Listening to this CD however, you would never guess that this guy who rants a no-holds barred fire-bombing, devastating everything in his sights until the last C-Word, WTC joke and W. jab is spewn, plays in a family film as a cute rat who cooks. Be warned, you will probably be offended.That all being said, between the political commentary I could have done without, there are some pretty damn funny bits. Chief among these, " At Midnight I Will Kill George Lucas with a Shovel," which is for all us geeks who express much hate at George Lucas' Star Wars prequels. Because, between all the hilarity, he actually makes a pretty good case. Then there's Oswalt's best track so far, "You Are Allowed 20 Birthday Parties." This track lays out the rules for how many birthdays you can really have, or the birthdays that anybody gives a crap about. And when you think it can't get any better, he gets to the 100's, where he explains that you can murder anybody, and get away with it. "This is how we weed out the weak people," Oswalt says, "if you get beat up by a 100 year old, then you deserve to die." This is a classic track that builds up and comes off so funnily.Oswalt has some pretty good material up his sleeve, and while it may sound formulaic at the times, like a standard comedy album, complete with 15-second tracks, and 6-minutes tracks, and witty commentary on such American oddities such as the KFC Bowl. Still, what separates Patton from most other comedians of his ilk, is he borderline annoying, without going over the annoyingness line. He crosses many other lines, but he never gets so annoying that you turn the album off. You'll come close with some of his weirdly waste tracks, but most of these are toward the beginning and the end. Otherwise, when he starts getting into his rhythm he comes up with some great one-liners. But really, next time Patton, no singing!So, while some may step back in horror, or sit back in boredom, but between all the filth, filler and such, there's some pretty witty and funny bits that will make you crack up. So, given the choice of Carlin and his politically soiled and tinged brand of "comedy," or Oswalt's vile, witty, nerdy and current brand of comedy, I'll easily take the rat who can cook.Real Score: 4.5

Star Wars 4: A New HopeThis classic was the first blockbuster, also this movie that gave meaning to the word geek, and gave Halloween something to look forward to. Excellent for its time, it came at the perfect time, the Vietnam War had just ended, and Americans needed some fun, and then came Star Wars.Although you may look back and think how fake that ship was, or how bad Mark Hamill's acting is, but this is not an analyze movie, it's a fun movie. That is what delivers fun is.Overall great 4/5 stars.Star Wars 5: The Empire Strikes BackWith such a hit like Star Wars you have to deliver a sequel and boy did they deliver a sequel!With Irvin Kershner at the helm instead of George Lucas, much needed characterization came into play, bringing the characters in new directions, and adding much needed depth to the characters. Also new locations, new villains, and new characters like Yoda, and a new plot to carry the series to the climax, all are added.The writing was also the best of any Star Wars movie; bring memorable lines like "Luke I Am Your Father!" Hamill's acting does get better but not perfect.Overall a great addition to the series with the characterization, better story, and better lines 4.5/5 Stars.Star Wars 6: Return Of The JediAn entire generation has been waiting for, the moment where we see Han is rescued, Luke comes face to face with his father, and the Dark Side and our heroes defeat the Evil Empire this moment. So how did life-size teddy bears make it into the movie?When you ask a person what he/or she, remembers most from Jedi it's "Those cute little Ewoks!" What! Forget that an entire galaxy was saved, or the harrowing conclusion to a six parter series. We should have known George would put Jar-Jar-Binks into the prequel. However, why mess with a good thing? To make it more kid friendly.Overall the movie suffered from childish creatures, lacking Irvin Kershner (who made the last movie), and less focusing on the conclusion 3.5/5 Stars.Overall, the series changed movies forever, and for good reason. This movie also paved the way for Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford. However, from a tainted conclusion I give the trilogy 4/5 Stars.Note: See the other three parts of my Unbiased Reviews of Star Wars.

The Kaiser Chiefs have certainly carved out their stake in the Brit Rock arena, driven by their hooks and catchy lyrics, the band only seems to get better with age. In their sophomore effort, driven by the catchy power rocker, "Ruby," the band puts out their most complete release yet, but they're still not all the way there. A little bit more variety could have been used, but they still can crank out a stunner when least expected.If you've not heard "Ruby" yet, then you're doing your ears a great disfavor, but warning be given, it's very catchy. "Love's Not A Competition (But I'm Winning)" may be the band's best, coming out of nowhere to sock you a chorus that'll blow you away, with its subtle but deadly approach. The words, vocals and music all speak perfectly for themselves, and they speak emotional impact."I Can Do It Without You" boasts some impressive hooks. "Everything Is Average" speaks truth in its lyrics, and provides some catchy rock to go along with it. "Learnt My Lesson Well" takes some bouncy cues from the pop rock genre, but could've taken the concept further. "Try Your Best" also has a surprising amount of depth in it, although it takes a bit too long to find it. "Retirement" also finds its spot toward the end of its run.The rest of the tracks however are not bad per say, but they are safe and predictable, with few elements to distinguish themselves from one another, although each does have positive elements. If you love the sound, then you'll by all means love the whole album. I was just looking for a little bit more shuffle and mixing it up.Call them the modern day "The Turtles," or a more radio-friendly version of Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs is slowly staring to come along in their musical journey. It may be a bit slow and predictable, but along the way there are flashes of genius sure to stick with you for a long time. Let's hope the band finds more of a sticking point in their third effort.

How's this for a concept? A man with an unusual gift brings his true love back to life, but can never touch her, else she pushes daisies once more. If you don't see the irony in this, then you might never get the show, because it's one of the most witty, brilliant, and certainly the most ironic on TV today. If nothing else, it gives a much needed weirdly original twist to cascade of murder-solving detective shows on today.Ned has the gift of changing people's cold fortunes, bringing them back to life. Unfortunately, if they're alive for more than 60 seconds, then someone else must take their place in the underworld. Since Ned doesn't want to inadvertently take another's life, he has to touch them again before the clock expires. This is both a blessing and a curse. It's a curse in that his childhood was hell because of it, and he can't touch his girlfriend now. The blessing is he can solve crimes by bringing back the disfigured murder victims to extract the information he needs to solve crimes, which adds income to his pie business, and makes his partner, Emerson Cod rather happy.These facts must be known to get any of the series. But even if you still don't get it, you'll appreciate the characters at least. This show has more quirky character that are so brilliantly developed, you would think this show was on USA. But it's not just the character. Brilliantly designed by all involved, this almost-fanciful world takes cues from people like Tim Burton and other such out-there stylists. The world lives and breaths effortlessly, and amazes you with the irony and quirk of it all.And even though this show is supposed has all the detective/murder-mystery elements that we know and watch endlessly, this show not only adds Ned's unique twist, but also much humor and wit in it's murder stories. Case in point, when Ned brings back the dead for his 60 seconds, they come back with all the scars that killed them. Whether this is a half-rolled face, knives or glass shards sticking out or whatever, it may seem gory, but once you get over the shock factor of the first time, these scenes play for all comedic value, causing you to laugh, no matter how wrong it may be.The cases have also so far turned up must quirk, whether it's the killer who uses real test-crash dummies, or the guy who says his wife killed him, but he has 3 wives, they all take quirky and ironic twists that keep with the show's feel. Never do the cases feel over-done, in fact, they might feel a bit underdone. Because the murder isn't the focus here, it's just a side-story. The show is all about the characters, and there story plays out centerstage, instead of the other way around.And how could I go on without also giving props to the narrator, Jim Dale. Yes, I'd say it's pretty unique for a TV series to have a narrator, and no he does not bore you, but rather, he enchants you with this forensic fairy tale, giving you all the details without it sounding like an explanation.So overall, certainly a show I'll keep watching well into this season to see how things all pie-pan out. It restores faith in the originality of shows on ABC and network TV. Certainly ABC's best show, and certainly must-see TV, Pushing Daisies is the quirkiest and most ironic show on TV today. Can you say Emmy's?

Fact: The British like to dance.Fact: This album is so pumped with adrenaline, it's bad to drive to this. You'll find yourself doing 100 MPH. Yes, it's that good. "Open My Eyes" is pure adrenaline, say goodbye to coffee, because this is a pure action song. You'd expect it to be played in huge action movie scene, like a high-speed car chase."Lifelight" is a song that actually has lyrics, but that doesn't hinder the song, as it's still a great dance song, and it could fit right in with the club scene. The rest of the album is filled with great beats, and cool vibes. Overall, a great unique album for the Christian music industry. This album is so cool on every level, even Andy Hunter's name sounds totally cool. I just wish more people could hear him. So try it out, but don't drive to it. You'll get a ticket.

Starting off with probably the best action sequence seen in an animation film, Bolt quickly finds itself immersed in classic Disney cliches and themes, but the good thing is that nobody does it better, and it has characters to keep you hooked. These characters radiate a comfortable warmth to them, with interesting personalities and good characterization, all anchored by a surprisingly good, if not sometimes unknown voice cast. The animation is also nearly on par with Pixar in terms of quality, and John Lassiter's influence clearly has an effect on the movie.But if the adults weren't satisfied enough, the kids will be glued the whole time, if not with a state of fascination, then they'll be laughing at every move the hamster-in-a-ball, Rhino, makes. He's the breakout star from the movie, possessing both a sense of cuteness and fun.Overall, through all the cliches, and slow scenes, and despite all my expectations, me and my family actually loved this movie. Granted, it gets points taken away for unoriginality, but this movie is packed in a nice positive package, wrapping things up very nicely in the end. And it Blu-Ray, I imagine it'll be that much better.

After the release of mmhmm in 2004, Relient K got major mainstream attention; MTV, The Tonight Show, and other venues now featured the band for the first time. The band also captured the attention of one Todd Mark Rubenstein, one of the leaders of "The String Quartet Tribute," a group that puts the classical spin on everyone from "The Beatles" to "U2," "Good Charlotte" to "American Idol," over 200 albums in all, with Rubenstein doing over 40 of those himself. That's right; your favorite Relient K songs have been turned into classical music.Now, before you click away, at least find a sample of album first. If you don't like what you hear, or if you're not a fan of classical music in general, you'll most likely not like this project. This review, however, is for the rest of us.The way that the group works is they go note for note on the songs, replacing the band's instruments with violins, cellos, and the occasional drum. But, the obvious first question is, does it work? Well, one advantage is that it puts more emphasis on the emotions of the music itself, with songs like "Getting into You" and "Jefferson, Aero Plane," this works well. However, there is an exception with "Let It All Out," which was primariy vocally and lyrically driven, not quite as musically reliant. The quartet's version, being all music, doesn't work as well.Surprisingly, taking on guitar driven songs such as "Softer to Me," "Failure to Excommunicate," and "Pressing On" gives new angles to the songs, and more of an appreciation for the melodies that Matt Thiessen is able to craft with each one. And although not a string instrument, the drum plays an important role on the album as well, especially with "Be My Escape." The drum's presence gives the song more depth, and more bang for the buck, but it only comes out when needed. The string treatment also does fan-favorites justice. "Mood Rings," "Sadie Hawkins Dance," and "In Love with the 80's" still remain as fun as ever, even without the lyrics that made the songs.I recommend that you listen to Relient K's versions of the songs, then the string versions; so you can gain a greater appreciation for the album and the songs. Otherwise, if you don't know the songs, it's just a nice album for background music, and a nice modern alternative to the legends that composed symphonies with just a piano, and their mind.Overall, if you're not a fan of classical music, then you'll probably pass this one up. However, if you're willing to give it a try, then I highly recommend it. With most cases in the album, the string tribute does each song justice, and adds new depth to them. A worthy tribute of a band that will go down as legends in CCM history, all I can hope for is The String Quartet Tribute to Relient K Pt. 2.

You know it's going to be scary when somber/scary music starts playing, then when a woman takes out her hairpin and stabs it in her neck, you must admit that M. Night takes a rather artful approach to filing somebody dieing. Of course, that rather artful scene could be the only one of the movie, as it's a stark contrast to a later scene where a man purposely feeds his arms to a group of lions. It's not bad in of itself, it just comes out like a Monty Python sketch. And this would be the story of the movie. At times it's well-done, and at times it's laughable.Example, the marriage troubles that's the unfortunate subplot of the movie involves the wife feeling guilty, acting like she's cheated on her husband, come to find out she only had cheesecake with him. It's at this fact, that the husband feels lied to and betrayed about. To this, he responds by conjuring a story saying he was so attracted to a pharmacist, he bought cough medicine, even though he didn't have a cough. The wife is horrified at this fact, until the husband reveals he was kidding. Yes, this subplot is pretty bad, but also delightfully cheesy.The Happening happens to be an attack of plants on humans by releasing a toxin that makes anybody affected to kill themselves via any means. Why are the plants doing this? Because we're poisoning our environment, which is the real horror in this movie. It's incredibly cheesy, and entertaining, even though it could have been carried out better in terms of plot/action. I mean, if NYC is killed by plant toxins, that's going to set the nation back quite a bit, not to mention the massive loss of life. Also, don't try to figure out the logistics of the toxin, or how it works, because you will be confused. It kills people in large groups, then kills a singular people without explanation.Mark Wahlberg has seen better roles, however he carries possibly the film's funniest/cheesiest moment when he finds himself talking to a plant, trying to convince it that he means them no harm, and he only wishes to go to the restroom, come to find out the plant is plastic. With scenes like this, I'm even surprised he took the role. Zooey plays the wife who likes to keep her feelings inside, even though Zooey is known for being that energetic indie girl. Besides the fact that plants are makes people kill themselves, Zooey is still the highlight of the movie.Seen as the cheesy film it is, M. Night Shyamalan's first R effort is entertaining, but the type of film you'll only want to see once. Why is it not to the par of other M. Night films? Because he's purposely trying not to be himself, which kind of hurts the movie, but helps give the film its cheese. So what is the happening? The cheese is what's happening.

As a big fan of the incarnation of the Chipmunks in the 80s, I kind of liked the first Alvin movie. Granted, it wasn't anything brilliant, but it was funny & entertaining enough for a watch or two. Then I decided to watch this movie with the family. The results? ALVIN! WHY DID YOU MAKE SUCH A BAD MOVIE?!?The major problem with the film is the fact that it takes place in High School for most of the movie. That's right, a regular high schol, with famous Chipmunks, and the Princible is a secret huge fan of the group. The film then proceeds to play out like a generic newcomer-to-high-school-film. As in, the Chipmunks struggle to gain acceptance, get bullied, blah, blah, blah. Oh, then at one point, Alvin decideds to turn his back on his friends, and they get mad at each other. Then there's Ian, and he has the Chipettes. Oh, and Jason Lee is in the hospital, so the video-game addicted Zachary Levi has to "look after them."Really, at such low expectations, Chipmunks didn't really have that much to live up to, but it fails to even reach this high bar. Everything is so uninspired, and much of the jokes fell flat. Granted, the movie did provide enough laughs for the rest of the family for them to get through it, but after a while, it just became painful. Everybody is here for a paycheck, and a paycheck is what they got. Just next time, I wish they'd try a little bit harder.

When I got my cellphone, it came preloaded with this cool ringtone called "Sugar Sweet." No, it doesn't have anything to do with The Nutcracker, but I was intrigued by the 30 seconds of the song that came with the phone, so I searched out the group and got the full song. I dug it. It's a lite pop rock song that sounds more of a 60s track than a 00s track. It's catchy and I love the guitar work in it. It keeps a nice melody and ends up to be a pretty good song. The next step was to check out The Icicles' album, and this produced different feelings altogether. In fact, I felt like I was hearing different variations of "Sugar Sweet" musically on ever song, with different lyrics thrown in to keep it different.I really wanted to love the album, but every song sounds the same, with the best being truly saved till the last track. Is it lack of creativity, or lack of material, or did they just find a proven formula, and stick with it for every song? All possible, but I think it's just lack of talent, because every song has the same instruments. So it might have been because nobody wanted to get left out, or this is all you can really do with what they had to work with. In either case, it unfortunately doesn't pan out on this album for The Icicles. So pick up "Sugar Sweet," and leave it at that.

I first became a major Hawk Nelson fan back in 2005, when I heard "Letters To The President". However, I got the special edition. So far, this album has been out for a year and a half, and no special edition. And I might just be paranoid, in fact I know I am, but I suspect that if I buy this album, they'll come out with a special edition, and I'll have wasted ten bucks for bad timing. So until there's definitive proof there will be no special edition for this CD, I'm not buying it.But that won't be the only reason, the album is a step down from the debut in my opinion. In the debut they tackled issues with a blazin' guitar anthem, i.e. "Letters To The President". This time, they tackle them with the interest of a gnat, or at least I had the interest of a gnat. "Zero" and "Everything You Ever Wanted" suit the Christian radio crowd just fine, but for Hawk fans it just doesn't work."Something On My Mind", "Hello", "The Show", are highlights of the album, and would have fit great with their debut. "One Thing I Have Left" tries to channel the debut, but in my opinion comes out to hard rock, which I don't care for when taken to the extreme, except in special instances. However, a totally interesting song, totally surprising, and strangely works for me, "Fourteen" is a haunting song. What it haunts about, I have no idea, but hey, the song works for me, in some strange way.Don't tell the feds this, but I listened to the album illegally. But, that's the only way I'm listening to it. The band cut a title track to the album, which didn't make it, but it would be great for a special edition, but no, they won't set anything in stone yet. And it's not even a great album, just OK, with the highlights being the only songs worth listening to.

Having lived in Winter Haven for two years, and thirty minutes away for most of my life, I feel the band is like my hometown band.Anberlin is a breath of fresh air in the circle of Christian rock. The singer's voice is nothing short of unique. The music is original, yet appealing. Most surprisingly are songs like "Cadence" where the songs are actually catchy, and stay in your head after listening.Overall, I proud to say they're my hometown band. They're a great group that isn't afraid of going against the grain musically or vocally. Good debut, and a good starting place for their budding career. Hopefully we'll here a lot more from these guys in the years to come. You don't have to agree, but it's my opinion, and I'm sticking with it.

Try this: put this CD in your car, and CRANK IT UP! This is the type of CD you actually want you non-Christian friends to hear. This music invites you to loosen up, and lose your mind in dancing. The beats and raps are nothing short of incredible. And these guys are not afraid to be different, just look at their names! Now, this music might stun you at first, but after a few listens you will be singing the praises to Krunk Rock. ROCK ON!This album is not for serious people, it's pure party, and it never lets up. Favorites are many, and letdowns are few to none.By the way, get the special edition, it's the icing on this delicious cake.

If you haven't heard FF5 yet, do yourself a favor and listen to the best debut album of ALL TIME!!! That's right the best debut, of all time! There's no hype, just substance. And the special edition makes it even better. While you're not going to get hip-hop with these new songs, you'll get some great rock. The riff for "I Love You To Death" is incredible.Did I mention the new album art? AMAZING! Check out the picture behind the actual CD. Original. Buy this CD, love it, share it, Crank It UP, and hang the art on your wall.

After the release of "Sunrise To Sunset" Paul Wright became addicted to Myspace, he composed songs for the site, he spends so much time on the site it's sad. Unfortunately, Myspace has also drained his talent. "Saturday" is a great dance song, a great fusion of disco and rap. Great rap, Paul can rap, better than most rappers, which isn't hard to do, but still pretty cool.Unfortunately, the Myspace syndrome starts kicking in and the CD goes downhill, literally. By the end of the album you're praying for the ride to stop, not because it's scary and unknown, but because it's frankly boring. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Paul Wright, his first two albums are excellent! But Myspace has taken away his talent. Now he is nothing more than a quickly fading memory. Sorry Paul, but drop Myspace while you still can, it's not too late!

Trevor McNeven brought these guys into the Tooth & Nail fold, which is interesting considering there's some real comparisons to Hawk, and TFK side-project FM Static. The result is an improved fusion of both bands, with original Hawk mixed in."California," "Someone Else Before," "Letters To The President," "36 Days," are the highlights of the album, with all but the last being great punk rock songs that rival even Releint K, while the latter song is a I-Miss-You ballad, which is sung beautifully, and has great lyrics."Like A Racecar" is the only song I didn't like, which sounds way too much like TFK, which could be explained by the presence of McNeven. The song seems very out of place on the album, and could have been saved for another album. But's it's nice the band is trying all forms of rock on the album.The rest of the album is a mixture of funky punk rock, and some slower songs that don't detract from the album at all, and might even enhance it. Some of the songs are short, but they burst of pure energy that could be compared to MxPx in their style of let the dam flow. Or, let it all out, don't stop.Overall, a great debut by some rockin' boys from Canada, this is my favorite punk rock CD, and for good reason. The band really does a great job here, and leaves nothing in the open. It's an open and shut case, if you're looking for good rock, this is the CD for you.As for the deluxe edition. The acoustic versions are good, not exactly for the punk fan, but for the pop/rock fan, buy it. The other two tracks are fillers, Jason Dunn speaking in French? Please, I've seen some pitiful bonus material, but this takes the croissant. The other track you shouldn't buy is the introduction to "My Generation" which tells the basic information about the song. Hawk likes the Who, and they played it on a now cancelled TV show, big deal. The cover is OK, not a big fan of The Who, but hey, it's OK.I bought this album not having the original album, so I was pleased that I waited. Now, why can't the band keep putting out more bonus material for their new album? Pet peeve maybe, but buy this edition if you don't own the album. If you do, buy the non-useless material off the Amazon MP3 Store.

Wait. All these songs are recycled from previous albums? Nothing new? And not one good song out of the bunch? What's the point of buying this album then? That's my point. It doesn't get much worse. This is a lazy, pathetic excuse from the Newsboys. Sorry, but you failed your fans badly. Harsh words yes, but they deserve every one.

When I first heard "Here In Your Arms," I was blown away, it was a beyond amazing modern love song that was filled with genius. After taking a look at the quirky album cover, I thought, what could go wrong? The answer? Much goes wrong, but much goes right.First off, the highs, as I have said before, "Here In Your Arms" is a must-listen, and an amazing song that's as sweet and catchy as it is brilliant and original. "All Time Lows" is a quirky jam of pop-rock shiny happiness that for the most part stays with this album. This song is so full of the energy of love, it sometimes loses it's place, but eventually gets back on track with. "Oh It's Love" is a Hawaiian style tune of love that only needs a pineapple to complete its mood. "Figures A & B" also seems to pull off its thing quite nicely, towards the end, with the beginning lagging quite a bit.The rest of the album however, is just, eh. Nothing special, nothing to write home about, in fact they are completely and utterly forgettable. "All Your Love," "Stuck To You," "I Saw It On Your Keyboard," and especially, "Two Weeks In Hawaii" are not only not catchy, but you can hardly think of the tune by the end of the album. There's just nothing special about them, and nothing to make them really stand out. Sure there's the electonic voice, but that's more of a Hellogoodbye thing. "Homewreaker" has nice opening chords before completely losing it by the end of the song. "Baby, It's Fact" is random gibberish brought on by happy sunshine bursts of love. It's not only weird, but a bit awkward.The sad part is all the letdowns didn't have to be that way. Every song could be brought to greatness, if only given the chance, some work, and a very good producer. Forest Kline definitely is one of the greatest minds in the pop-rock genre today, but you only see it in short spurts here. So does the band just need to grow? Or is it the producer's fault?In either case, over half the songs are not worth listening to more than once. So you might just be better off buying a few tracks, not the whole album. Not to say it's a bad album by any means. It's just not nearly as good as it could have been. While most will still see the album as a complete mess, some might see it as a brilliantly creative mess. In either case, I can't wait to see what Hellogoodbye does on their next album. Just make the album longer, please!

If there was ever a film that needed to be remade, then this was it. Sure, the original was good for whoever watched it growing up as a kid in the 80s, but by today's standard the movie is little more than a joke. Fortunately, this film will be relevant for much longer than the original, and Sam Worthington does a much better job than Harry Hamlin.The story follows the same basic premise of the original, with a few tweaks, so it's still an ancient road-trip movie to save the local princess, except this time the film adds a heavy amount of more motivation for Perceus. This time, he's driven by revenge, and his desire to be more man than God. And in this sense, while the story take a little bit too much of the screen time, and there are lulls, the story does a serviceable job creating a cohesive narrative that moves from setpiece to setpiece. The characters are a bit less serviced, and by the time the movie is finished you only really get to know Perseus. Thus when a character dies, you're a lot less inclined to care, since there's a great disconnect between the emotion of the film and its audience. Thus, for me at least, it was simply about the action.And the action is pretty good. Since the larger creatures are just so fantastical it was hard for me to get into those scenes as much, but anytime Sam Worthington has a sword I'm happy. But still, the Medusa scene is one of the film's highlights, and apart from the fact that he looks like a sea monster version of Godzilla, the Kraken does provide a lot of great destruction. Plus, it gives the line that will forever live in the annals of film history in, "RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"Overall, Clash of the Titans is a mostly satisfying B-movie action matinee, and a great way to kill an afternoon. It may have its problems apart from the action, and I'm not exactly thrilled at a possible sequel, it was a mostly enjoyable two hours, and that's all I can ask from a movie nowadays.

Let me first say that I thought The Early November's earlier work was terrible. Maybe a bit too acoustic emo for my taste, but it mostly bored me to death. This project however is their crowning jewel. Their "legacy" will now be defined by this album, because it was their last. It's ambitious to say the least, and you rarely see this much variety in a CD by any artist, much less a group labeled as pop rock/emo. Did Chris Carraba do anything half as incredible as a bunch of tracks on this record? Not a chance, because even after a few years, this project still overall holds up through all the dust and angst.The Mechanic: By itself, this album contains some awesome emo rock anthems that will stick in you head long after the CD stops spinning, if it ever stops spinning. Surely, by itself, TEN's best album by a good margin, and they could have made some darn good albums like this one. It's a mix of Dashboard Confessional, Anberlin, and with plenty of Mae to liven up the variety. But the thing is, when the songs work, they work BIG time. Unfortunately, since the record is experimental, some songs don't work in the case of "The Car In 20." But sometimes, it fails in some parts, but live up like the case in the dark "The Rest of My Life."Highlights include "Money In His Hand," which is the best song with that theme, and an amazing pop rock, the powerhouse chorus of "No Good At Saying Sorry," the somber and emotional "Long Talks," and the darkly tinged lyrics of "Decoration." But it deserves it's own distinction. Because not only is it the most catchy, but simplest song on the record, but it's anthem feel seems so powerful, it's hard not to get swept in it. Add to that the amazing rock anthem chords that go with it, and you have one helluva stunning rocker."The Mechanic" Real Score: 4.5The Mother: Like the previous disc, this is experimental record, but this time it leans toward the happier pop rock side of music, with plenty of Dashboard Confessional-type anthems thrown in for good measure. And this is where the band pushes themselves, because they've already done that acoustic emo stuff, but now they want to change it up a bit. The result is "From Here To L.A." which stretches Ace Enders' voice to the breaking point, and at times it comes off horrid. If it wasn't for the vocals, it would be a good song, but he had to strain it. It's kind of downhill from there because the last few songs on this disc don't really have heart, and come off boring and uninspired.Highlights include "A Little More Time," which might just be the best song on this project with its stunning chorus and thoughtful verses. "Hair" has a truly peppy and happy chorus that's topped off with its whimsical verses. "Driving South" comes off a bit forced in the chorus, but its verses are full of out-of-left-field lyrics and images. Who knew a modern folk song could be this artsy? "Scared To Lose" also aims to please with the most pop rock song on the album. It's bright and sunny and is a love-themed ditty. And a quick little shout-out to "1000 Times A Day," which is virtually chorus-free, and amazingly verse-driven. Whether it works or not, is another opinion to each his own, but pretty interesting song structure."The Mother" Real Score: 4.5The Path: The album that killed The Early November, and one that was universally hated by all. So were they right? Oh yes, this album is horrible beyond belief. It's dark, depressing, hard to understand, random and painfully boring and self-indulgent. In fact, if they were going for art with this album, they came out with something more resembling random brushstrokes by a man who had recently gone through a stroke. And all through the album I kept wondering, "Why should I care about this guy's life?" Add to the fact that the guy's voice is horrid and unlistenable, and hard to understand, and you have yourself an all-out mess of an album, and a sad one at that.A highlight, if there was one on this album, is "The Runaway," which isn't that interestingly lyrically, but the music is what drew me in, with the violins and such. "Decoration" also gets a softer chorus in a revisit."The Path" Real Score: 1.5Overall, The Early November's last decoration is a mixed-bag. On the one hand, you have plenty of disappointments, including "The Path." But on the other hand, you have a ton of amazing highlights that will never get the credit they deserve. So pick it up if you're a TEN fan, or download all the highlights I listed. The Early November may be gone, but thanks to this album, they may never be forgotten.

I must make a correction. When I called this album "Silently Brilliant," I must correct that statement by calling this album "Silently Mediocre." Sorry, but I listened to the album again, and it just isn't that good. It's not even good as a whole, some songs are good, yes. But the album screams boring and mediocrity.For highlights, "Chocolate" is of course a very sweet song, "Run" hits high marks when it's in chorus mode, and "Spitting Games" makes for a good upbeat rock song. Other than that, the album is filled with forgettable, boring and otherwise mediocre songs that never really capture your attention, or lead anywhere. Gordon Lightbody is good as always, but the quality of the songs don't match his talent. And in cases such as "Somewhere A Clock Is Ticking," the song title is better than the actual song.Overall, I've heard it before, and I've heard it better. Although there are a few good songs, the project is underwhelming, and frankly a disappointment. You'd think otherwise by reading other reviews of the album, but don't be fooled. Bad start on the big stage for Snow Patrol, aka Polar Bear.Real Score: 2.5

Note: I've only heard one song off this album.That said, the song is one of my favorite songs of all time. I heard "Savior" on the radio a few years ago, and loved it. You have to listen to it to believe it, but this is the greatest worship song of all time. The lyrics, the melody, the vocals, all flawless. About half-way through the song you'll fall down in adoration. Yeah, it's that good. Find it, listen to it, worship to it, love it. Unfortunately, the group never caught on, so less than 1% of Christian music fans know the best kept secret of Christian music. It's Farewell June's "Savior". You might find it in your local Family Christian Store, you might find it on I-Tunes. If you can't find the song, buy the album off Amazon. You won't be disappointed.

Coming into Speed Racer, I had very low expectations for the film. I hated the cartoon, it looked a bit childish, and the Wachowski siblings helmed it. What could go wrong? Well, plenty does go wrong, but plenty goes right. Granted, most of these moments have nothing to do with the filmakers and lay solely in the CGI department, but I was surprised with this film, in a good way.This film is a true roller-coaster in more than ways than one. Quality-wise, it goes from interesting, to bad to just plain stupid, which it stays at for awhile. Then when Speed Racer agrees to run the forbidden death race, the film starts taking an uphill turn, going from bad, to just so bad, it's good. I mean, the Ninja scene will cause you to laugh out loud, but not because it's funny, but because it's just SO bad.It's when the death race really starts going where the visuals start carrying the movie. The crashes, the environments, the action, the falls and drops all contribute the movie's jaw-droppingly amazing visuals. Several moments produced a verbal 'Wow' for me, making this a must to at least see once in HD. Then in-between races, the movie starts coming together, for most part becoming a good to great movie, depending on what moment you're at. The final race brings the movie all together and really makes it worthwhile, for the most part.Where does the movie go wrong besides the absurdity and stupidity of many "serious" scenes written by the Wachowski siblings? Chiefly, the movie tries to hard to appeal to everybody. It doesn't really strike me as a kid's movie, mainly because of the action, story and visuals will fly over most youngsters heads, but yet, Speed's younger brother and chimp way overstay their welcome. It's a bit cute at the beginning, but then they start cutting into the good stuff. You're then forced to go between the more intense races and fights as such, only to be broken up by the antics of the overly childish duo. I mean, there's kid friendly, then there's stupid. They fall mostly into the latter category.The acting is decent overall, everybody does good with their roles, especially Cristina Ricci, and Matthew Fox does the best with what he's given. However, the movie makes a grave casting error. The role of the evil & cheesy corporate giant Royalton should have been filled by Tim Curry. I mean the no-name who does it in the movie played the character like he was Tim Curry. He sounded like Tim Curry, he acted like Tim Curry, and Tim Curry would have been brilliant in the role, because it was perfect and made for him. Sure it was small, but it bugged me throughout the WHOLE movie.Overall, Speed Racer greatly surprised me, although my fears were both confirmed then denied. It's a whirl-wind of a movie that could have been done better without the Wachowskis, and with a lot of editing, since the film clocks in at over 2 hours. There's lot to love and hate, with most of the love coming from the visual effects department. What's weired is, I actually wouldn't mind a sequel. But like that's ever going to happen!Real Score: 3.5

After Mr. Wright's stellar debut album, his sophomore had high expectations. However, there are some changes. Mainly the limiting of genres. The debut had a colorful cornucopia of genres, half of the genres, or more, have been cut. Another interesting thing is there's not many songs you can compare to the debut, totally different. There's no songs like "Rock The Show" "You're Beautiful", or "Brighter".The first five songs really take off on the beach theme introduced in the debut, and incorporate them in worship tracks, rap tracks, and in fact, the whole album would play nice at the beach. "Heaven" is the first, and one of the best tracks off the album. The song is catchy, great musically, and a real winner for Mr. Wright. I don't quite get the meaning of "Come Around", but it's a fast paced song sure to keep you tapping your feet.Tracks 5-7 are some unique tracks in that I've never heard anything like them before. "Resurrection" is by far the weirdest, with a just plain weird. It's hard to tell if it works, but it's not one of those songs that isn't going to make you feel rosy. I'm not saying it's a bad song, it's just very different. In this section is also a great hidden track, "Burrito Boy". Think it sounds rude? Well, if you eat at Taco Bell with any regularity, then you'll love the song.The last three songs lean more to the style of the first few tracks, and "Surfah Girl" is easily one of the highlights of the album. "Thank You" is also a great worship song, improving from the worship song he did on the debut.Overall, besides tracks 5-7, this album is pretty darn good. A little short, and a little weird in the middle, but Mr. Wright still knows how to make music. I just wish he could've had more songs with other types of music.

There's a reason why I call tobyMac the master of music, with his work with DC Talk and his incredible solo career. However, the Mac has some trouble here finding his solo identity. First off, 18 tracks is highly impressive, he must have been working on the CD for a few years. But there's one thing I noticed throughout the whole album, an identity crisis, he wanted to not be DC Talk with just one singer, he wanted to be different, this CD is trial, and some of it comes to be error.There's about 4 highlights, "Somebody's Watching" is a great funky hip-hop track with a gospel singer on background vocals, and the whole track works well. "Love is in the House" is my favorite track being a fusion of rap and pop. "In the Air" is an unique song, being really part conversation set to a beat, and it works well. And finally, the first track, which is a great party song, and seems to be the only harder rock song I liked.On the other hand, the rest of the songs either don't work i.e. "Irene", or are very hard rock or hip-hop i.e. "J-Train," "What's Goin' Down". If you like the hard rock group RED, you'll like the Mac here. Me? I think it's too over the top, in fact it's WAY over the top. The lyrics point to crimes that are downright disturbing. The problem here is that the album is going to appeal to a younger audience, what are they going to think of the second verse of "What's Goin' Down" where the story of "Susie" is recounted?After the phenomenon that was DC Talk, Toby felt he had to get away from it as quickly as possible, so do a hard rock/hip-hop/rap record with very little pop. Obviously the experiment didn't work too well as Toby totally shifted away from the hard stuff, and went lighter. He finally found his identity with "Portable Sounds", this album on the other hand is better for I-Tunes.There's a reason why I call tobyMac the master of music, with his work with DC Talk and his incredible solo career.

Marching in with hype and top-level producers, Motion City Soundtrack is clearly looking to make a statement within the music industry, that pop punk/rock is not dead, but it still lives on. With Fountains of Wayne frontman Adam Schlesinger and The Cars' Ric Ocasek in tow, they look to conquer a kingdom somewhere. Strangely enough, it may be the tools that make this sculpture have some of its most glaring flaws.Probably the most noticeable lowlight of the album is "The Conversation," a standard piano ballad that comes off more insincere than it does emotional. Other than that, the band produces an album full of strong, but not necessarily memorable tracks. Case in point: "Broken Heart." And even the strongest tracks suffer from attributes I attribute to the producers. The back-half of "Hello Helicopter" is a good example, as it turns from an original and emotional track to too much of a pop rock emo fest.And yes, the album does minorly earn it's language warning sticker. They throw around a few S-words, a F-word or two, but the strange thing is that it seems like the band is just throwing them around just to either sound cool, or be more mature. Let's just say, I could have done without them, but they neither hinder nor help the album to a great degree.Pop punk highlights include the fun "This Is For Real," whose music video is a must-see. "Can't Finish What You Started," and "Where I Belong" also finish what they set out to do. In terms of highlights, the band puts probably puts out their best and/or second-best in the one-two punch of the quirky "Antonia," and "Even If It Kills Me," which is a strong set, finding its place in the back-half of the song. However, "Antonia" does lose a little momentum everytime the song leaves its verses.Overall, Motion City Soundtrack lives up the hype and produces a strong set of songs, which wind up to be the band's best, by far. They come up with some catchy and fun pop punk/rock, adding a sense of quirk to the album. However, aside from the strong but unmemorable songs, the band makes little mistakes that take away from songs.Looking to the credits however, a pattern emerges. Its impressive duel-producers seem to be the cause of the problem. While Ocasek is consistent in the album, Schlesinger is largely inconsistent, of course specializing in the pop punk songs, but faltering elsewhere. Little mistakes hinder the album, but if you're looking for a fun pop punk/rock album with variety and quirk, then this is the CD for you.

Don't tell anybody this, but I like this album. This is one of the best Pop albums I've ever heard. Joy Williams has a great voice, and brings such emotion to her songs. Better song writing really helps this release compared to her earlier work.Only major problem is the length, I would have liked more songs, more bang for the buck. Some songs are better than others considerably, but they are still good.Overall, a great Pop album, not totally formulatic, and don't even get me started on the album insert. Whoa! Buy it, love it, listen to it, look at it.

Back in the day, bubblegum pop had a tight grip on radio. Artists like Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys cranked out hit after hit, sucking every dollar out of every tween and teen in the late 90s and early 00s. Then there was Carly Hennessy. She achieved a record contract the old-fashioned way (by hard work and luck), and she came from a rather modest background. She clearly caught the attention of the record execs because they sent "You Get What You Give" mastermind Gregg Alexander the job to produce it. Unfortunately, the album died by its timing and though it was on obscure shelves across America, gaining a following, the album held silent till 2008. It was here where the new and improved Carly Hennessy became Carly Smithson, and took American Idol by storm. And even though again, timing sent her packing early, attention came back to her old album from fans searching for everything Carly. So what will they find? A radically different Carly. But first, I must say that I did not cry when she left AI, and I am by no means a fan.The album has the writing of its producer all over it, most evident in the mid-tempo "You'll Never Meet God (If You Break My Heart)." Strange and long title aside, you might get deja vu when you hear the countdown. In fact, this very well could've been The New Radical's follow-up album. "All Kinds of People" is the standard racial harmony song that could've worked better in the 70s, but it's pleasant enough. "Just Missed The Train" also puts up a very strong effort on the album, and it would have been perfect for any number of Country divas, especially Martina McBride. In fact, I would love a cover from the Country music circle. "I Need A Little Love" and "RIP In Heaven" also hit and surpass their marks to make for an excellent back-half of the album. You make up your own mind on "Get You Off" however.The highlight comes in the form of the bouncy, but failed single, "I'm Gonna Blow Your Mind." The song does all its supposed to do, and creates an amazingly catchy and upbeat tune, radio-friendly to the core, but more pleasant than a basket full of kittens. Britney has never thought creating a song this good. And it seems Carly takes a jab at the former pop princess in the song. It's sweet, and like the rest of the album, has rather impressive vocals. Trust me folks, it's not easy to do some of the stuff she does here.Unfortunately however, the album does have its weak moments. Mostly from "Beautiful You" and "Surface Wound," which I'm not even sure where their marks were, much less if they hit them. "Young Love" also has some of the more stranger moments on the album.But the problem that bugged me most was the length. Not that the album was 52 minutes; I was cool with that. But the fact that there were only two songs less than 4 minutes bugged me. Even the best of songs could have been cut dramatically, and radio edits are an absolute must for the album. Because when you lengthen the song, you give it more room for error, which the best of artists make, much less a debut. This album could've easily been five star had they cut off 30-60 seconds off most of the songs.Overall, under the direction of Gregg Alexander, you know you'll find something you'll like. Fortunately, there's substance to go with the fluff, and fluff to go with the substance. Truly a debut, with its varying Country and pop elements, Carly does well with most of what she's given, and you'd expect the occasional song that's not up to snuff. But most surprising, she hits a few songs out of the park. Call it the New Radical's follow-up that never happened, an underrated pop album, or just call it what it is, just plain good. I just wish they could've edited it down a bit length-wise.

What do you expect from a band who's main audience is Radio Disney? For some dome reason this pathetic sister duo decided to promote their music to CCM audience, they even brought on famed producer Ian Eskelin for a few songs. What does it amount to? One of the worst albums of the year. The covers throw rotten eggs at the original versions, and the stench seeps through the rest of the songs. The music is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, their voices aren't anything to write home about, and the lyrics are downright pathetic. Why buy it? Don't, boycott it! What's Christian about this music? What's even good about it? By the way, their new album only expands on the bad parts, it might be so bad, it's burnable.

Taking all the roles Vin Diesel wishes he could have, The Rock/Dwayne Johnson has made quite a name for himself as that likable tough guy, which 'Race' seems to lean on, even though Johnson is often less than charming as he was in "The Game Plan." In fact, characterization and/or story sort of lacks, and most of the movie feels like filler until the next chase sequence. Sure, there's some genuine funny/cute moments, but most of the movie is either been there, done that, or 'that's nice/cool.'But in the end however, despite its many faults, and probably mostly due to the likable kids in the movie, the movie turns out to be enjoyable, if not entertaining. If you're looking for a little excitement in your family film, then this is a fine choice for you. Otherwise, it's neither here nor there, until you somehow find yourself there, and it somehow winds up being good. It's also nice to have a Tom Everett Scott sighting.Real Score: 3.5

This little hard to find gem is just that, a gem. With the price tag you have to pay nowadays for it, it's really only for the hardcore fans. And they'll be no disappointment for them here."Push" is like all the other versions of the song live, so if you have one of their live DVD's or whatever, this song doesn't really hold you purpose. "Crutch" is on the VH1 concert DVD, but for those who haven't heard that version, it's basically an interesting little jazz ditty, that sounds like it should be from the 50's. It's a song with many old fashioned influences, but it's still a good listen."Suffer Me" is a new studio track from the band, and it starts off very well, and while it fades a little in the chorus, it's still a very good song, and pure Matchbox Twenty. However, one has to wonder, why the song was put on this rare EP, and not a studio album. "All I Need" could be the best track off the record, I don't think it's been on a live DVD, so it's pretty fresh. Rob Thomas really shines on the verses with this song, and proves that he truly is one of the greatest musical minds of the past 20 years."If You're Gone" is a kind of a fusion track, because it's mostly acoustic guitar, but it's sprinkled with electric. The song is slow, and and at times, boring, as they took the emotional element out of the song. "Disease" is a complete departure from the song's hardish rock roots. Rob Thomas does a great job with this song, and really brings out the heart of the song.Overall, the audience for this EP is very narrow; collectors mostly. But it you're a fan of Matchbox Twenty, and happen to come across this gem, than you won't be disappointed. While this gem is a little unpolished, it's good parts still shine through.

This is a dark, dark, dirty, dirty, awkward comedy that's surprisingly sweet, but above all, a very funny crowd-pleasing film that you should feel horrible for laughing at/with.Most of the funny comes courtesy of Steve Carell, where it becomes clear to me that he's one of the greatest comedy actors of the past 20 years. Carell simply elevates every scene he's in, making stupid jokes funny and gives you the go-ahead to laugh about terrible things. Cast anybody else in that role, and the film is a mean-spirited and unfunny dud. Take for example the final dinner scene. Carell delivers the Dreamers speech perfectly, and then when Zach Galifianakis gets up and does his thing, which is terrible, mean-spirited and downright sad, you laugh and feel for the character because of the energy and love Carell injects into the role. In fact, his whole character in general is kind of depressing. He makes the Mouseterpieces to express himself. I mean, there's a scene where Paul Rudd is going through a few of Carell's Mouseterpieces, and it's portraits of that character's troubled marriage and his wife breaking up with him. It's presented in a silly way, but not only does the film make it emotional, but Carell makes it work with the character. It takes real talent, and pretty decent writing/direction to do that, and Dinner for Idiots does it well.Not to say the rest of the movie is bad, it's just kind of underwhelming for most of it. Paul Rudd does what Paul Rudd does, and his relationship story simply isn't interesting without Jermaine Clement or Steve Carell to spice it up, until the end. Oh, and then there's that dirty, dirty stalker. Terrible and easy jokes are made with that, but they're still pretty dang funny. During Inception, my head hurt because I was thinking too much. During Dinner for Idiots, my head hurt because I was laughing too much.Overall, one would fear that the trailers would give away all the jokes, but in context, the film is completely different, in a good way. It balances the awkward and painful moments well, and comes together with a great climax that while may be a little clich&eacute;, is crowd-pleasing all the way. In fact, when the film was over, my audience audibly clapped for a while to express their pleasure with the film. Give it a watch, and you will laugh. When you laugh and how often will depend, but rest assured, you will most likely laugh. And that's what a good comedy does. Especially in capable hands like this that the film gives to you.

Could it be? Is it possible that the best/safest place for our castaways is on The Island with The Others, Smokey, magnetic & time anomalies? Is it possible they shouldn't leave? That's the question Season 4 asks as life on the Island gets worse, but it's shown that life off the Island is even worse. Make no mistake about it, season 4 is quite different than the seasons proceeding it as the story starts building towards something, and the sci-fi elements of it get that much stranger. And oh the complexity!Highlight Episodes:The EconomistThe ConstantThe Shape of Things to ComeThere's No Place Like HomeNaturally with the more story-driven nature of the season, the characters are kind of pushed aside, but that's not totally on the fault of the series. While we are given new characters to get to know, we've already know inside and out the regular castaways. And probably the biggest fault of the "flash-forwards" is that we don't really get that much character development. We might see a new side of Kate, but it's Kate & it's a logical progression for the character I'm not exactly sure we needed to see. Sure, it sets up the later season, but I'm not convinced it really works in tangent with this season. It doesn't hurt the character development like Season 2 did, but it doesn't really help and/or do anything for them either. The lone exception to this however is probably Ben Linus, who progresses significantly then what we've seen of him previously. Plus, Michael Emerson could be doing nothing and I'd still be fascinated with him & his character.But again, Season 4 is focused primarily on the story. Sure, it may be slow towards the middle of the season, but there's just so many great moments here. The whole Freighter storyline is played well, and the foreshadowing and setting-up in this season is all compelling. And what's best is that besides being just fascinating to watch, it's also original, which is a great thing to say when a show is in its 4th year. I mean, I know "The Constant" has been praised to no end, but the episode just works so well as both a sci-fi and character piece. Make no mistake about it, an episode featuring Desmond is always a good one, and "The Constant" is one of the series' best.Overall, Season 4 is a thrilling ride, and it's worth the trek if only for "The Constant" and 'No Place Like Home.' It's not the best season, and it may not move the characters along as much as I would like, but its primary function is foreshadowing and setting up the events to come. It has so many great moments, both story & character-wise, making Season 4 well worth the trip.Real Score: 4.5/5

The reason I love Indie music so much is because between all the saps trying to make it on MySpace, you find a group that truly blows you away with their originality, style and prose. The Brother Kite is certainly no exception. I first heard heard of this "shoegazing" band (whatever that means) by sheer randomness. And it might have been the best random piece of music I had ever heard. It was different, it was distinctly summer, and it blew me away."The Coat of Arms" gets the ball rolling with a very rousing instrumental anthem before shifting into a slow interlude, all preluding to the stunning "Out of Sight," which is the best work of the album. An amazing song that doesn't make sense lyrically, but the music is just so stellar, nothing else really matter. I don't know what sound it really is. You could call it "shoegazing," but I'd like to think that this is what the Beach Boys would've sounded like if they were out today. Really, if you check out nothing else by the band, then check out this song, and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's so good in fact, I have to make up a new word to describe it. It's... Scrumtrelescent!The album treats every song like a piece of art, and gives to each its own. You won't find a clunker, filler, or something you could have done without. It all meshes, it all amazes, and it's all so different. The Brother Kite clearly know what the highlights are, because they give them all fitting preludes. "Get On, Me" is another great song sure to please, with more musical variety, great structure, great vocals, and again, it's all so easy to dig. And believe me, I'm digging holes to China on this album.The Brother Kite bring originality back, and do something totally original and different. Or at least it's original to my ears. I certainly can't see anybody doing it better than these guys. Read it as a concept album, a summer album, or the album that amazes you it does. If you're looking for originality, something for your summer, or just a great piece of music, The Brother Kite is flying high with this one.

Having heard a few really great tracks off this album, I decided to see how much more The Click Five could impress me. And while no songs impress me as much as "Headlight Disco," "Flipside," and "I'm Getting Over You," most of the album entertains and pleases any listener with impressive vocals and songs that try to add a little bit more depth and variety than your average pop punk album.As with any good pop punk album, the first three opening tracks aim to please with their rockin' atmosphere. They're catchy, fun and perfect for any summer. "Addicted To Me" brings in some synths to add a 80s/new wave feel to it, but the song is mid-tempo, and isn't that exiting to listen to.As I said in my review of "I'm Getting Over You," the song is an amazing breakup song that goes above and beyond this unoriginal type of song, and brings true emotion into the picture. But the song is needlessly short, and they could have stretched it out more. "When I'm Gone" is well-done that's a little catchy, and has some really good chords that make this a pretty good power pop/rock song."Headlight Disco is also another excellent highlight that begs you to move your feet in this dance tune that would fit perfectly at a skating rink. It's pretty original for this genre and is certainly a crowd-pleaser. "All I Need Is You," "Long Way To Go," and "Mary Jane" all have their good elements which make them good songs, but they unfortunately don't stick in your head very long. "Empty" closes the album out with a ballad with contains some great vocals and emotions. The song also gets better as it goes along, building to its grand finale.Overall, this album goes beyond the call of a pop rocker's duty, and The Click Five separates themselves with some much-needed variety in their music. Add some great vocals, catchy and crowd-pleasing tunes, and you have a pretty good pop rock album which is sure to please any fan. And while they won't win over any fans outside the genre, they'll please and entertain any fan of the pop rock scene.

Alright, so coming off the high that was Season 1, we dive into Season 2. Unfortunately, like any other sophomore season, this show has a LOT of growing pains, and they're very evident. Sure, we get a lot more mystery, but most of the events of this season are virtually erased by the middle of Season 3. But don't worry, Lost is about characters, not story, right? Yeah, but they frustratingly can get much right there this season.Highlight Episodes:Man of Science, Man of FaithThe Other 48 DaysOne of ThemLockdownLive Together, Die AloneAlright, so we do get a lot of great moments in the Hatch, and we do get to know the Tailies, but by season's end, most of the Tailies are dead, and the hatch is blown up. The mystery certainly did its job, but in retrospect, it was kind of for nothing, besides a few character building moments. Which brings me to the Flashbacks. These moments in the first season often gave us insight into the characters, but in season two, they mostly tell us what we already know, and a lot of them feel just straight-up pointless and not enjoyable. Sure, they're useful when first meeting the Tailies, but that's about it.Then there's the crime this season commits against its characters. By the end of the first season, we had grown to love these characters, and while they weren't always likable, they had a good reason to be so. This season however, it seems the Island has a tendency to just make everybody annoying/jerky. Basically Sawyer, Sayid & Locke are untouched by this rampage of bad turns with characters, but that's because they align with who they were last season. I can't say as much for the rest of the characters. Jack becomes increasingly more irrational/annoying when he goes he becomes more of a roguish leader shaped by the harsh reality of the Island. Kate isn't given that much to do, but between love-triangles & more irrationality, she became annoying very quickly. Michael wasn't there for most of the season, and he was just trying to get his son back, but I found him more frustrating and just being in the way of the action I actually cared about to care about his predicament, or even try to justify his actions, since they were completely irrational. Sun & Jin took way too long to get where they were going in their personal journeys.And then there was Charlie. My god, what did the producers/writers do to Charlie? There was simply no reason to bring back the heroin storyline with him, and they just made him into a pompous jerk bent on being a smart-ass & nothing more. There was simply no reason to do this, and again, the Writers spent a LONG time after that to get the guy to become likable again, and it just barely worked because it reminded us of the Charlie of Season 1, since Charlie of Season 2 was a douche. I also wasn't a fan of Claire, since she became the new Shannon, ala annoying screaming girl, who I just lost all physical attraction for. And again, most of her actions are not rational in any sense of the word.But, for all that Season 2 does wrong with the characters, it does introduce us to the wonder that is Michael Emerson & Desmond Hume. Henry Gale/Ben Linus just makes for such a perfect foil of John Locke, and his character is just so compelling, even though you don't know a single thing about him. His expressions, his actions, every word he speaks and doesn't speak is absolutely spell-binding. And even though Desmond Hume is only in the Season a grand total of 2 or 3 episodes, the character is fascinating on every level, and does the most with his short time.Overall, the story is compelling and a lot of interesting stuff is raises, the Season suffers from a grand sense of pointlessness, and what it does to the characters that we fell in love with just a season before, is almost unforgivable. They may have Lost their way, but at least there's enough good elements here to find yourself getting through the Season, on to bigger and better stuff.

Remember when Steve Martin used to be funny? Yeah, it seems so long ago. Nowadays he's expanding his horizons, going into more dramatic territory, but I'd never pen him to write a story about terrorism and double-agents. Unfortunately, when Neal McDonough appears within the first five minutes of the film, I could tell this was going to be less than fun/good/watchable.Neal is awful as always, Don is understated, but good, Jeff is in the film for all of two minutes, and Guy Pierce (not Ritchie), actually gives the best performance of the film, which isn't saying much. However, it might not be the fault of these actors, but instead their terrible characters. The movie gives no reason to like 99% of the characters, and when stuff happens to them, you're more like, 'Oh well, when is this going to be over?'But mainly, the main problem this movie suffers from is lack of a cohesive point. Is it entertaining? Not unless you find a fictional view into the life of terrorism entertaining. Does it make you think? What's there to think about? If it's about conflicts between Islam, the merits of terrorism and stuff like that, then I frankly don't give a crap. Is it a political movie? It certainly has enough politics to turn anybody off, and a general sense of uneasiness not seen outside most horror films. And it certainly isn't a thriller, so what is it? A Jason Bourne knockoff? Hardly. While Don Cheadle's character is touted as being this great soldier, only one brief instance of this is shown. The rest of the time he gets the crap kicked out of him. I care about the character even less, as he can't even fight.It would have been much more watchable if it had better direction and editing. First off, the first thirty minutes of the film has Don Cheadle undercover in a Yemen prison full of terrorists. Complete bore, and useless. Easily could have been cut to 5-10 minutes. Hour's gone by, nothing of real note has happened. Easily could be 20-30 minutes at this point. The point is, this movie should have been no more than an hour and a half. Then there's the direction, which is expected considering the only major credit the guy had before this was writing the global warming disastor movie, "The Day After Tommarow," which spell trouble right there. For example, there's an important scene on a bus, which done properly, would have been a great ironic moment, somewhat changing my negative opinion of the movie. As is, the scene is a confusing mess where you can't tell what the heck is going on.In summation, it's a thriller that doesn't thrill, a drama that isn't that dramatic, and a movie that wants you to think, but isn't worth thinking about. What movie these positive reviewers were watching, I don't know, but this movie suffers from bad direction and lack of a basic point. However, even with multiple trips to the editing room, and better direction, it's still a 3.5 effort at best with its drab subject matter. This movie was a traitor of my time. Don't let it betray yours.

Two years later and Relient K is ready to bring game. Songs focus on girls, God, and life's various challenges. While pop culture still pops up sporadically--Jefferson Airplane, Britney Spears, 80's-- all referenced, they're clearly backdrops to more mature themes like moving forward in life.Songs about the "complex infrastructure known as the female mind" are given droll twists--ever give an emotional girl a mood ring? The band also found their forte--punk songs with wordplay. The best example would be "Mood Rings" with lines like, "If it's drama you want, then look no further. They're like the real world, meets boy meets world, meets days of our lives."And the classic--"And it just figures that we'll never figure them out, first she's Jekyll then she's Hyde ... at least she makes a lovely pair."The highlight is "Jefferson Aero Plane," where the strengths of the band are united in an idiosyncratic song that takes wordplay up a few notches, provides stellar vocals, and one of the best melodies of the past five years. While the lyrics are cryptic at best, it's infectiously catchy, and one to remember, as genius flows a waterfall.The tunes are fantastic as the guitar solos are brilliant and catchy in "Over Thinking." Overall, Two Lefts... is one for the CD collection. While imperfect, the album carries exceptional songs and is a worthy chapter in the band's legacy. As for entertainment, listen to the hidden track after "Jefferson Aero Plane," rest assured, you will not be bored.By the way, the Gold Edition isn't all that much different, except for one music video, and that's really it. But there could be a sound quality difference, which I wouldn't know, without having the original album.

I know what you're thinking. "In what world can this movie be good? SNL hasn't been funny since the 90s! How can they make movie out of such a stupid and unfunny character?" Well, I thought the same thing, but then I saw the movie with an open mind. The result? Stupid. Hilarious. Brilliant.Anybody that says it wasn't funny, or that it was a bad movie was either too offended (understandable), or full of crap. Sure, it may look bad, but go into it with an open mind, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Don't believe me? Here's a rundown of the 3 most hilarious scenes:1: MacGruber has sex with his wife's ghost at her grave in a cemetery. However since she's not real, he's thrusting air. Hilarious visual.2: MacGruber has a scene where, he's becoming friends with Ryan Phillippe, then they're ambushed, and MacGruber uses Phillippe as a human shield, causing him to get shot up. Unknowing to MacGruber however, Phillippe is wearing a bulletproof vest. Hilarious visual.3: Kristen Wigg is undercover as MacGruber in a coffee shop. She tips the guy behind the counter, but MacGruber would never do that, so she is forced to take back her tip from the tip jar in front of the poor dude. Then, MacGruber is attacked in his van, and since Kristen Wigg is supposed to be saying everything he is, she ends up lying on the floor screaming "OH MY GOD!" Another hilarious visual.It basically plays itself as a serious 80s action film, but it'll just throw out ridiculous gags. For example, MacGruber says, "You're loco man!" The screen then pops up a subtitle saying, "You're crazy man!" There's also running gags about a license plate, celery etc. There's so many jokes flying past, it's almost Arrest Development like. Again, these statements may sound out of line, but you must watch the film to know what I'm talking about.Overall, with story that fits the action, great jokes & a cast that supports it and sells it all, MacGruber does what so many spin-offs & SNL films haven't done, it stands alone as a great piece of entertainment. You don't have to know to skit to like this movie, you don't even have to like SNL today to like this film. The two are completely different. This film is almost out of the Apatow school of thinking, and I will defend this film as one of the best films of the year thus far. I even predict cult classic status.

Of all the bands in Canada, The Weakerthans could be the Great White North's best musical product. They've certainly influenced me musically, showing that the lyrics don't really have to make sense, or even fit. They're almost the definition of what Indie rock should be. Of course, that's their later albums, in their debut however, they create a new genre, Folk-punk. It's certainly something along the lines of original, but the problem is that the album is mostly throw it up against the wall and hope it sticks. Some of it works, but most of it seem to be an unintelligible mess of ideas that don't work. And after awhile, it all starts sounding the same.Granted, it's their debut, and it a very raw demo-like quality to it, but while it breaks some musical ground, it's anything but the sometimes brilliant work the band put out in their succeeding albums.Real Score: 2.5

"The Men Who Stare At Goats" is an amusing and silly film with a great cast, but it's ultimately inconsequential. If you looking for just a fun movie about crazy people doing crazy things, then you might like this film. Granted, the plot is anything but mind-blowing, but the dialogue is pretty funny, and the actions relating to the Jedi soldiers are pretty amusing. The cast all does well with their roles and are mostly pretty funny. Ewan McGregor was probably the weakest, but he was also the narrator/straight man for much of the movie. Plus, there's goats falling down. Add to the fact that the film makes liberal use of the band Boston's "More Than a Feeling," and can you really fault this movie?

"All About You" was probably the best Christian rock song a few years ago. Sure, it was hated for being to similar to a certain mainstream song, but it's still in my top 10 on my MP3 player. The follow-up? Bad. It stinks. It's bad pop. "Breakthrough" and "Lone Ranger" attempts to be good, but falls on its face and highlights as some of the worst songs of the year. I don't get it, he had a great thing going. I guess he aged like a tomato. Yeah, it's that bad. Don't buy it, buy his debut. I give it one star because some of the songs aren't totally terrible, they're just OK.

Continuing where Transformers left off, the Autobots are valiantly defending Earth from the pesky Decepticons. Along the way, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, but who cares, the Decepticons always lose at the end of the day right? That is until new ones are created, or brought back to life by other pesky Decepticons from outer space. It is then where College Freshman Shia Laboef (I hate spelling his, or his character's last name) must then help save humanity, with the help of familiar friends and Meagan Fox, who filmmakers could find no better reason to be in this film other than cheesy emotional scenes and eye candy.I must admit, this film is impossible for a real movie reviewer, or critics to review because their job title has them breaking down movies to see if you should enjoy them. Unfortunately, if you break this film down, it loses all it's fun. So don't think, just sit and enjoy.See It If:You like Awesome action: This is almost a pure action movie, because the fighting sequences are stunning, and really make you get into the movie despite any flaws it may have. Sure, a 20-minute action sequence may be overblown, but I was enjoying every moment of it.You like comedy that is funny in the moment: To balance the intense action, the writers upped the quotient on comedy this time around, having several LOL jokes that kept a semi-permanent smile on my face throughout the film, especially in the college scenes. Kudos especially to Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson who play Shia's parents and teacher, respectively. I could have done without the juvenile scenes of dogs humping which a 6-year old sitting a few seats down from me found particularly enjoyable. However, don't think about these jokes later, because you mind lose your mind trying to wrap it around these jokes.Don't See It If:Your movies are driven on plot: This plot is one in the moment as you get it when it's happening, but you're left wondering later how the heck they got there. Again, don't think, just sit and enjoy.Your tolerance for pure stupidity is low: Yeah, this has been beaten to death by other reviewers. You have been warned.You hated the Transformers mythology: Because if you got confused before, you're going to be scratching your head here. It's like they went for the geeks, and left the rest of us just to ignore that aspect, because it gets confusing.Now For Some Observations:This movie is very grounded in 2009... Swine Flu jokes? Economy jokes? And a Chevy Volt? Will anybody get what any of this means in 10 years?Speaking of which, from the first scenes GM makes their presence known because they must have gotten a HUGE contract with the government.Obama is anti-Transformer! He's mentioned specifically by name in the movie as wanting to shut down the Transformers program as he feels they could be a threat to nation's security. I mean, he is pro immigration! His National Security advisor is also a jerk within the movie, so it shows poor judgement in his staff choices... Republicans, ravage at this fact, Democrats steer clear of these scenes.Did the composer get lazy in this movie? I counted no less than 4 times Linkin Park's "New Divide" was played in the movie either instrumentally or in full. Same goes for Green Day's "21 Guns" which I counted no less than 5 times during the movie. It also happened to be the ONLY song playing in Meagan Fox's garage.Again, a LOT of civilians die in this movie. In the first I was shocked when a Decepticon plowed through a bus, but in this movie, that's nothing. Buildings are wiped out, cars are smashed at will, aircraft carriers are blown up with no survivors. It's almost numbing after a while.Overall:In a survey of viewers that saw the movie, 91% said it was as good, if not better than the first. I would join these people in saying that what the first one sets up, the sequel takes and runs away with in explosive fashion. And despite its many flaws, I was fully-engrossed in the movie, and you will be too if you don't try to break it down, or take it too seriously. But I must admit I have seen this movie 4 or 5 times now, and it grates on me more every time I see it, so keep repeat viewing at an absolute minimum. Keep your unbridled joy of watching the first time in your memory.

In case you're one of the few who do not know ho MC Lars Is: MC Lars lays down the pop culture references and post-punk-laptop-rap in an original fusion of awesome rapping and fun. Rapping about girls, roommates, time machines and even providing his own social-consumerism commentary on the "crunk" culture; no topic is too out there. Even if it involves a rap about Ahab and his hunt for a whale, MC Lars never fails to entertain. And it isn't just his lyrics that are original, but he samples music from Iggy Pop and Supergrass, and his sound ranges from slow pop to punk, to crunk, so he's incredibly diverse sounding great in all styles. His phrasing and his great lyrics also provide plenty of one-liners and social labels, which are perfect for a cult following to latch onto. Highlights include:"Download This Song""Hot Topic Is Not Punk Rock""Rapgirl""Ahab""iGeneration""If I Had A Time Machine, That Would Be Fresh""Internet Realationships""Signing Emo"Did I also mention it's catchy? Really, I can't these songs out of my head, and it has tons of replay value, so you know you're getting your money's worth, if the awesome rapping doesn't entice you first. So overall, as somebody who struggles to find rap that fits my niche, since I didn't grow up in the ghetto, it's not to find a guy like rap. Now finally I can ride around with the bass kicked in. Add in a sense of humor, and picking up MC Lars' The Graduate is a no-brainer. Really, why is this guy not on the radio???

The Expendables is an idea. A supposed embodiment of machismo heralded by great action stars of the past present, and in alternate universes, and a symphony of gunfire and explosions.This is just an idea. This movie is false advertising. It's movie that when describing it, you use words like "more" and "less" to describe everything. There is simply very little, or very brief moment of the film getting something right. For example, a good scene where some baddie is getting their hand cut off, or a good scene of somebody getting blown away by a shot gun. But these moments never translate into anything more. They don't extend to make fully memorable action sequences. Instead you comments like, Less dialogue, more action. Less Dolph Lundgren, more Jason Statham. Also, it could have used a better story. You know, the type that isn't driven on Stallone's liking for this one random girl. The type that isn't forced to go to the bad guy's island in the middle of the movie by calling it "scouting it out," when really they just didn't have a better excuse to get some action in. The type that just isn't generally punctuated by god-awful writing, the type where you get to the point of tuning out of the movie and getting popcorn or a drink or something when something isn't immediately blowing up.Overall, even though I rented The Expendables on Blu-Ray, I still felt a bit cheated. I liked Jason Statham, I liked some of the action, but most everything in-between was a complete and utter bore. Some people will feel the action and the sheer amount of nostalgia hanging around will make it all worth it, but no matter how you slice it or dice it, the film hanging around its idea is bad.

Let's get one thing straight, if there's no Kevin James, there's no Paul Blart or 150 million the movie made in the theater. Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a family film purely for families, and although it's painful/boring in the first half, but the second half redeems the movie because who is set up as the stereotypical loser becomes a hero when he takes on a group of robbers on Thanksgiving night. Hilarity and fun of course ensues, and this film will leave any family with smiles on their faces. It's better than you'll expect, and there's some plot twists you won't expect.Some other elements I liked included Keir O' Donnell who does a great job as Veck Simms, the criminal mastermind. I also enjoyed the various X-gamers, although Jason Ellis' role in the movie was too small. Although this fact is remedied in the behind the scenes and deleted scenes on the DVD. And of course, Kevin James really makes the movie as he plays the classic lovable hero. The underrated Jayma Mays was also lovely as always.Overall, is it the best movie ever? No, but it's a great pick for family movie night for both the adults and kids. The first half could have been better, but taken as is, Paul Blart is a great little film the whole family will enjoy. It's at least worth a rental.

In the world of fantasy films, there's original, refreshingly unoriginal, and unoriginal. Inkheart falls headfirst, painfully I might add, into the latter. You see, the movie gets lost in translation between great concept, and messy execution. Maybe it's because most of the characters are whiny, or not likable, not to mention one-dimensional, but the acting is atrocious also. Brandon Frazer is truly sleepwalking, Paul Bettany should know better than to do this, and what the heck is Helen Mirren doing here? Did she wander onto the wrong set, and the writer's were so overjoyed, they wrote some lines for her, in which she doesn't contribute to the movie what so ever? That sound's about right.This randomness continues into the plot, taking good opportunities and not playing on them, or ignoring them. The daughter in the movie is left alone while the father goes off to save the day, bad guys kidnap girl, father is surprised when this happens, she ends up saving the day. Oh, the chiche! Not even chiche with fun, but chiche is lots of tediousness, which amounts to an hour and 45 minutes that feels twice as long.Overall, the only redeeming feature is that your easy to please 10-year old might like it if you rent it, but you will want to stay away, and never, under any circumstances, buy this wasted piece of chiched and tedious, not to mention painful, crap. And they want to make a sequel to this? Oh, kill me now!

Clay should have won American Idol, but this is also the only good album he's made yet. He does the classics well. It's your standard Christmas album, take the songs as is, use the Clay voice, and it's a hit. The originals on the album stink, which is why his other stuff is no good, he has bad original songs. But his covers are very good. "O Holy Night", "Mary Did You Know", "Winter Wonderland", are among the highlights.Overall, if you're looking for an original album, look elsewhere. These are just Christmas songs with the Clay voice. That said, he has a great voice. So if you're looking for the Christmas standards, look here, looking for something more original? Grab Relient K's Christmas album.

All ask for in these type of movies is 4 things. Stuff blows up. Comedic lines are given. The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. The Losers has a hard time living up to these standards. Stuff does blow up, but except for one or two scenes, they don't really have the impact you want. Comedic lines are given. A character is good. And the film lags dearly between all the action. On these aspect, the film mostly fails, but overall, it's entertaining enough. Let's expand on these points, shall we?Stuff Blows Up: By far the most memorable scene is where a motorcycle does an awesome crash into an airplane, and it blows up, and Jeffrey Dean Morgon walks away from it, because let's face it, cool people don't look at explosions. And while the rest of the action isn't as memorable, it still kept me entertained while watching the film.Comedic Lines Are Given: If anything, this film will renew your love for Journey's "Don't Stop Believing." Most of the jokes comes from Chris Evans character, but the others on the team do their share of one-liners & amusing dialogues as well. If Jason Patric's character is anything, he's unintentionally funny. How evil is he? He shoots a woman for not holding his umbrella right. I found that amusing. But I'm also a dark and disturbing person apparently.The Characters Are Great: Chris Evans has had a very long streak now of being the best thing in every movie he's ever been in, and this continues in full-force for the Losers. I suppose he actually has a skill, but the movie mostly turns to him for laughs. A sequence in a building featuring Evans caused uproarious laughter in my theater, and other scenes featuring Evans are also great. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a cool dude, but not a specifically memorable character. Same with the rest of them. They all have their traits, but none except for Evans really stick with you.The Movie is Consistently Entertaining: Here's the problem with movies like these. They have to keep up a great pace so the audience isn't really thinking about what's not happening at this very moment. Why? Because they start asking questions about plot holes, or "Why are these characters even here?" The space between action may not be as long as I may make it out to be, but the film could have been more easily paced. I could also discuss plot, but hey, are you really watching this movie for plot?Overall, The Losers will make for a good matinee or rental, but not much more. I know it's kind of a mindless action film, but there's just not enough substance here. Plus, if you have the choice between this & the new A-Team movie with Liam Neeson, there really isn't a choice. The A-Team blows The Losers out of the park. No, watch The Losers for some decent action sequences and Chris Evans. There's no Win-Win situation here. Everything just ends with the word "Lose."

Christmas albums are always the hardest to tackle, since everybody either knows the classic songs, or the original songs either don't fit, or don't stick. But to add an element of punk to your Christmas party, you can't go wrong with this charity record with the stalwarts and new faces of the genre. The result? A surprisingly great record, with excellent takes on the classics, and originals that should be classics.The Highlights:Forget DecemberYule Shoot Your Eye Out (The song is a whole lot better than the title)I'll Be Home For Christmas (Best song by the group, Christmas or otherwise)Ex-Miss (NFG almost never disappoints, and this song is no exception)So This Is Christmas (One of the best takes I've heard of the song)The Most Wonderful Time of The YearA Cradle in Bethlehem (Probably the best of the disc)Sure you have your sleepers (Sleigh Bells and Wine), and punk for punk's sake (Christmas Night of the Zombies), but there's certainly enough holiday cheer and Grinchiness for the price of admission. So if you're looking for a rockin' and original Christmas record, or if you just like one of the bands, I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

I was a huge fan of Sanctus Real's sophomore CD. It was the first CD I actually bought, and until I got into Relient K, it was the pride of my CD collection. Imagine how hyped I was when this CD came out. Imagine my hopes when JFH gave it a stunning review. I bought the CD, and liked maybe 3 songs, all of which were in the first 4 songs."I'm Not Alright is a great rock song, and it's lyrics have a great meaning. "Eloquent" does very well in it's weaving of wordplay, something Relient K has mastered. "The Face Of Love" is a my favorite song because it's a great worship song, and every word is deep in meaning.Other than that, the CD is only good, but not great. Compared to "Fight The Tide", this album just can't match up. The great riffs and lyrics that made the tide such a great album have been replaced by stuff that's more "mature." A case in point: "Benjamin." This was supposed to be a great emotional song to end the record; it's not. I don't feel any emotion listening to it, and all I hear is a poorly executed song. The same could be said for other songs on the album.Overall, if you've never heard Sanctus Real, I would suggest getting this album first, then "Fight The Tide", that way your expectations aren't so high when listening to the album. A fan's dissapointment. This album has pretty much lost me with the band, and my former love for them is all but a memory. Hopefully the next album will be better, but it will be hard to win this fan back.

When you look back, it's absolutely amazing Third Eye Blind only put out three albums, but those albums had some pretty classic material. If you don't own any of the albums, or you only got the 1st album, this is a great look into the band covering both the hits and the deeper cuts. If you've only heard the singles, you haven't heard the real Third Eye Blind. For only three albums, nearly every track on this album is pretty strong.Highlights Include:JumperGraduateNever Let You GoBlindedForget MyselfMotorcycle Drive ByBy the end of the album, especially after the back-half of the album, I literally felt like I had just broken up with someone who I thought was the love with my life, and I should just stare at some girl's picture for hours upon hours thinking of all the memories we didn't have. That's the effect Steven Jenkin's songwriting has on you. It's a somber reflection with lots of heartache that comes with the breakup. Don't be fooled by some of the peppier beats, Jenkin's lyrics rarely match the mood that is trying to be conveyed. This adds to the mysteriousness, the emotion and the quality of the music.Overall, while I could have done without "Slow Motion" with lyrics, and could have had a rarity, this is a finely put together best-of package. It showcases all the band's hits, it's deeper cuts, and progresses through the band's various sounds and emotions. In the end, it's an emotional journey albums rarely give, and this feat is pretty impressive. So while you're waiting for that forth album, takes a look at some of their criminally underrated earlier work. You won't be disappointed, but you might need a tissue.

This album gets boring toward the end. The first couple of songs are good, but the rest is just OK. Nothing that interest me. The special edition is good for long time fans, with the following of the band, and a behind the scenes look. But overall, not their best album, but STUPENDOUS compared to the rest of the stuff they've come out with so far in the decade. Still looking for the old Newsboys.

Sufjan Stevens is influential. This album follows in his suit, and even takes one of his songs. But hey, nothing wrong with taking a cue from the indie master. However, Crowder changes it to reflect just praise and worship, instead of just random thoughts about a state. The result is a hit or miss.The song that majorly hits is "We Win!". After all, how can you not like a well-crafted victory song? The song is rockin', and the people are talkin'.What makes this a concept album is that it's divided into themes. The first theme is the safe, radio friendly theme. If you've listened to radio for the past couple of years, you've heard this whole section. Which isn't bad, but it feels familiar.But, the weirdest collection of tracks in years is in segment three. This is supposed to be the future worship category. Now, with the theme of future in a music album you know it's going to be different. "Do Not Move" is officially the weirdest song ever. You have to hear to to believe it. What's even weirder is it starts growing on you after a few listens.Overall, an interesting album. David Crowder dares to be different, taking a cue from the guy that has mainstreamed this type of album. But, like all concept albums, it does have it's hit and misses. Which is expected. Just know what you're buying, before you buy.

Sugarcult has always been one of those bands that filled their quota, making some great tracks, but always releasing largely mixed albums. Maybe it's because of the constant style changes, or the fact that they resided on the darker side of pop punk, but besides their soundtrack placements, Sugarcult has never before been much to write home about... until this album. In terms of power-rock albums, there's simply nothing better. It's mature, it's surprising, and it rocks from start to finish, with almost no acoustics in sight. There's also no question that this is by far the band's best album.You'll find the band's standard more hardcore power-rock side in songs like the dirty "Los Angeles," "Dead Living," "Explode," and "Out of Phase." All are all good arena rockers, blasting speakers, and taking no prisoners along the way.Highlights include the catchy feel-good song, "Do It Alone," which also has a great music video, and the song fit perfectly in Dane Cook's movie star debut "Employee of the Month." "Riot" is a perfect hardcore arena rocker, with fists pumping in full, well, riot mode. "Majoring In Minors," despite its rather strange title delivers on all its marks and more. The peppy "Shaking" also delivers in the band's mature sunny side delight sound. "The Investigation" is also a surprisingly emotional love song, which hits all the right notes, especially on the chorus.And for those of you able to attain the bonus tracks from the Japanese version, then you'll be very pleased. "Freezing" is a short but sweet acoustic ballad. While the cover of "A Hard Day's Night" is absolutely perfect for the band, giving a short burst of power-rock perfection.I must admit, I wasn't expecting much from this album, but Sugarcult took me by total surprise, crafting the perfect power-rocker Fall Out Boy and groups like them could only dream about making. Sure it's not the most original album on the block, but power-rock usually has other goals in mind, and Lights Out meets and exceeds every goal. So for all those looking for a good power rock/pop album, then this is perfect for you. The Plain White T's this is not.

Liz Lemon (you gotta love that name) is surrounded by chaos, and without her, the world would fall apart without somebody keeping it spinning and/or GE would lose tons of money. 30 Rock is simply a show about crazy, over-inflated egos, and the girl that tries to keep them all together. And while Tina Fey amazingly plays the straight girl (to the confusion, and bemusement of some), the show's humor comes from the out of control egos, from the dumb blond, Jenna, self-proclaimed mental, Tracy Jordan, and the Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming, Jack Donaghy (NOT Donahy).Amazingly, the only episode that is a complete mess is "The Pilot," but as the show progresses, and finds its footing after a mere 4 episodes. From there on out, it's brilliant. The show creates compelling and humorous storylines, crafting great characters along the way. The humor is not always prevalent however, especially in Liz Lemon's personal storylines, but the show certainly has its moments, such as the classic fireworks spectacular that you have to see to believe. The show also greatly benefits from pitch-perfect casting. Also surprisingly, the show doesn't misuse, overuse, or abuse its use of guest stars (in this season).I must admit, it took 3 years for me to get into the show, but once you get into it, it compels you to keep pressing on. I don't really know why, or how they do it. They just do it. And the show deserves all the acclaim it receives, and yes, it deservedly beat The Office for at least this season. I look forward to spending more time with Liz Lemon, the best named character on TV.
