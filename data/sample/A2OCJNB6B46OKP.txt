Why would you take a franchise that had so much promise, and turn it into a monstrosity of a movie?When the first Transformers film was released back in 2007 as an `80s child I was highly anticipating my shape shifting robots on the big screen. When I found out that they took the time to gather Peter Cullen to go back to his roots and voice Optimus Prime I was awestruck. After a fantastic film that didn't really give me enough robots that I anticipated I was eager for more. Then came `Revenge of the Fallen' More robots, intense action, but unfortunately more humans and horrible acting in a over 2 hour film. After that a promise was made by Michael Bay that the third film was going to be one of the greatest action films ever and yes there would be more robots and more character development.`Dark of the Moon' came, there were some amazing action sequences, and yes more robots...BUT...no plot, no acting skill and just a bunch of special effects and explosions to cover the mess all up. This movie has the word fail written all over it I don't even want to purchase this DVD. Hell, this movie makes `Revenge of the Fallen' look good and that says a lot! At this point I am devastated after 4 years of what could have been one of the greatest stories ever told on film based on a true animation revolution, I was left with disgust and sheer disappointment. Take these movies...maybe not the first and bury them deep underground and let's never speak of them again. If there is a Transformers 4 or a Transformers reboot, you can bet your money that I will not be sitting in that theater.

While many were expecting The Chronicles of Narnia to be flops as films, no one would have expected the first instalment to be on of the highest grossers at the box office. Now with the second installment of hopefully 7 films the world of Narnia takes on a very different shape.The same actors who played the Pevense children are back to reprise their roles, but Narnia itself is no longer a world filled with fantastic creatures and magic. 1300 years after the defeat of the White Witch Narnia has been taken over by a ruthless leader who wants Narnia to be a...normal place. A place that will appear just as bland and ordniary everywhere else. It it now up to the Pevense children to return an rescue Narnia from this new menace and discover the true king of Narnia, Prince Caspain.I was very surprised by this film. Much like the first Narnia film it was not an incredible movie, but it was just as enjoyable and the atmosphere was a little more dramatic and mature. There is a lot of dramatic sword fights and meaningful moments between the characters and the new roles are played well by actors such as Eddie Izzard and Ben Barnes. Now we have to see what the next film will bring. There is new leadership for these future projects now that Disney as given the project to Fox. I am hoping that the rest of this story keeps the same elements that made the first two movies enjoyable.

If you are already among all of us working stiffs, pushing buttons for some guy with a fancy car and his own personal parking spot... what ever you do don't rent 'Wall Street'!'Office Space' is one of those few movies that really brings the average day in office to true life. Eventhough there are some overly exageratted scenes in this movie (oh and they are extremly funny), there are so many things I myself pointed at the screen saying 'That happened to me!'This movie is not one to be missed it IS the movie you need to watch when you come home from work. The characters are great, Mike Judge even got the stereotypes correct in the software field. There is always a huge woman sitting at the front desk directing calls, there is always an Indian guy (if you have called Dell computers for assistance you know I am right.) And yes there is always a geekey looking guy who acts like a hot shot, whom you have to lick the scum off of his shoes everyday just to prevent yourself from getting fired.To Mike Judge and the cast of 'Office Space', thank you for showing us all how to stick it to the man because we are all too big of whimps to do it ourselves.

The nightmares are getting worse and the scar is burning pictures of the dark lord in the mind of Harry Potter. Not even going back to Hogwarts, The Quidditch World Cup or even his huge crush of Ravenclaw seeker Cho Chang can keep these dark images away. Now suddenly Harry is about to face his toughest challenge in the Triwizard Tournament, as a mysterious 4th champion. He will face off against the Proud Victor Krum of Durmstrang School of magic, the fair Fluer DeLacour of Beaubaxtons magicical institute and his fellow student the popular Cedric Diggory.'The Goblet of Fire' is the best in the saga by far. The tagline says...'Everything Is Going To Change'. As the climax of the Harry Potter saga, the film was true to its word. This movie is far from the previous three. It has a PG-13 rating, ranging hormones and very disturbing ending. Still what made this movie so amazing was the work that was done to finally bring to life the one character that every fan has been wondering and waiting to see. Of course I am speaking about the Dark Lord Voldemort. Casting Ralph Finnes was the perfect choice, because he knows how to be the villain as you have seen in his previous work. His performance left me speechless and the fact he didn't even get nominated for a supporting actors Oscar shocked me...well at least Jake Gylenhall didn't get it either. Also the adding of Miranda Richardson and Brendan Gleason was also great. The regulars of the cast also did a fantastic job.What made me so happy about this new movie was the writers and new Director Mike Newell really looked at the past films and now thanks to the disaster of Azkaban, the right things were cut and added, the bonds of friendship were forged again and the cast finally played the correct rolls rather than just standing there for comic relief. As this first piece of the story comes to a close the stage is set for 'Order of the Phoenix'. With a darker chapter and a new director in the chair I am hoping that the last three films keep the fire that this film created.

We all know the typical mystery movie. A mans wife is killed and needs to seek out the killer and other people get thrown into the story. Now take that concept and show it to the movie going public....backwards! What you get is Christopher Nolans' masterpiece 'Memento'.This is one of those movies that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Eventhough you know exactly how the movie is going to end you are just waiting to see how the story got to that very point. A story like keeps you watching and thinking and that's probably why this movie is praised by millions. The cast is phenomenal and package is perfect. The funny thing is Nolan is now this huge director because of his re-inventing the Batman franchise. People may soon...forget that he was just as good of a director before that. That's why this film should be a true...memento for your collection. It is such an incredible movie it is not to be missed.

The world of Ghibli has astounded its fans for almost 30 years and while the last ten years were not the kindest to this animation studio, Miyazaki himself knew it was time to take the helm once again to remind us what makes his films so great. With that he gives us 'Ponyo'.Loosly based on the classic film 'The Little Mermaid', Ponyo is a gold fish that knows there is more to a simple life than just staying under water in the care of her sorcerer father (who strangley enough it not fish like at all). With a little intuition she escapes to the surface and takes on a human form. The she finds a little boy names Sosuke, a boy who's favorite thing in the world is to help people. When he comes upon Ponyo he wants to care for her too and they form a very special bond. Now the two of them need to fight and let her father understand that the world of the sea and the world of the surface can live together in peace so long as both worlds understand just how important they are to one another.This film is such an enjoyable on, because of the fact that it has gone back to the magical roots that make Ghibli films so amazing. The scenes where the water looks like faces crashing onto the last is so creative and all the bright colors and the innocence of the characters make the film more enjoyable. 'Ponyo' is the very first Ghibli film to be shown on a wide release of U.S. movie theaters. It is about time too. While there haven't been such great films since 'Spirited Away', 'Ponyo' is a sign that hopefully as the studio reaches it's 30th annuversey there will be some new films that are just as magical as the greats that came before it.

Tim Burton will always be one of my favorite directors. While his library is not perfect, he is one of the greatest story tellers in film history. With worlds of the outlandish and incredible heartfilled characters there was no doubt that Disney would call upon him for bringing one of the most beloved childrens tales to life, in Alice In Wonderland.Now, in order to truly appreciate this film you need to know your Alice 101. If you have never read the two Alice books (yes not many people know there were two books) Or if you haven't seen the 1953 Disney animated film, chances are this will not be the best experience for you. What makes this film so great is that Tim Burton wanted to give his audience something fresh, so he made his very own unoffical 3rd Installment. This Alice In Wonderland is sort of what Stephen Speilberg's Hook did for Peter Pan. In Tim Burtons' fims whether good or bad his cast is always great (most of the time because it's the same). The best performances here have come from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Cater filling in the shoes and head of the Red Queen gives you a true 'you love to hate me' character. Johnny Depp turns on his Jack Sparrow/Willy Wonka charm, but kicks it up one huge knotch. The only beef I had with this movie I think the CGI was a tad overdone. Sure we have come to an age where the CGI is king. Still, you compare it to so many of the Burton films before, the lack of CGI just made them all the more whimsical. Still, the movie is entertaing and so much fun to watch. I would say proceed with caution if you haven't caught up on the story in a while. If you are an Alice fan, it will be a good one for you.

I would expect a franchise that is apparently so successful to actually be good. After watching two disappointing films, the third just makes me want to dig a hole in the back yard and curl up into a fetal possition. I don't seem to see what is good about these films, so I must be going crazy.This film is poorly written, the acting talent is not even there. The worst part is that there are two decent young actresses in this film in Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard. Yet, they barley get any screen time in this movie. For a movie that was suppose to give me an incredible epic battle of Vampire vs. Vampire and Warewolf...I am left with just a cheap blur of second rate special effects. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson again horrible and Taylor Lautner is so pathetic in his delivery of dilogue. I mean..."Let's face it...I'm hotter than you???!!!' Someone crank out the crackers becuase I just thrown a butt-load of cheese. I even wonder why I am wasting my time watching these, maybe it's because of my deep longing to finish projects I have started...and know that it is important not to knock something unless you have tried it.Yes, I will see the final two films and yes I will give my thoughts. I am not trying to be biased because I am a huge Harry Potter fan, but I have seen all of those and unlike Twilight they actually try to improve on their mistakes and always try to make every following attempt better than the last. I also have nothing agaist Pattinson because I loved him in the film 'Water For Elepahnts' Frankly, once Twilight is over he will be able to bask in the glory in all of his Twlight royalties, and even if Twilight keeps getting the MTV best movie awards, I feel that in about 20 years no one will even understand the question 'So what are you, team Edward or Jacob?'

The Beatles will forever be legendary in the history of rock and roll music, their songs are unforgetable and their impact nothing less than amazing. Yet some how every now and again a new release from the Beatles comes to us that makes us look at the Fab Four in a whole new light.This time the Beatles come to us in the form of a brand new Cirque De Soleil show called 'Love'. Being in Vegas over the summer and completly missing that show really ticked me off. So when I was given this album for the holidays I crave a chance to go back to see the show. 'Love' is 26 tracks that span the whole history of the Beatles music. You really have to listen to the well put together flow. Listen for the blends of songs with a couple tracks as well as one of their songs played backwards and a bunch of other surprises that await you on this Magical Journey. Definitely take advantage of the two disc set with the audio dvd it is definitely a added treat and as a whole one amazing gift for the Beatles fan in your life. This piece once again shapes this band into a whole new animal eventhough they are no longer together this album was definitely made with their true style in mind.

There are plenty of movies that show the traditional comming of age tale, but nothing compares to the comical, extreme and sometimes painfully true film that is 'Trainspotting'. Trainspotting is the story of five screwed up pals looked upon as the dirt and rejected in their Scottish upbrining. Each over their heads in their own screwed up addictions. Everything from substance abuse, to theivery, to petefilia, these guys have dug their own graves so deep it would be a miricle to get out of it. Yet the main character Mark Renton played by the brilliant Ewen McGreggor is the one that is forced to change his ways against his own will. Through loving parants and a high school student he accidentally had relations with, Mark manages to begin enjoying life. Even when temptation arrives again in the form of his mates he still manages to free himself eventhough he admits to being a bad person he knows he is on the right track with our without the people that made a major impression on his life.This story is one of the most relatable ones I have seen in all the movies I have seen that tell this story. In life we all grow up with a small circle of friends. These are the people who let into the deepest darkest corners of our souls. Even if they may the most brilliant of people, or low lives, from those who are pure to those that are pure evil we kept them close just because they trusted and understood who we were. Yet a time comes in all our lives where we must face the real world put aside the childish games and sacrifce our time to jobs and keep our lives in line with modern society. It is up to those same friends who we still hold dear to our hearts or just hate to join or be left behind in the gutter to rot. It is not because we are bad people who don't care about others, it's because they are not willing to join us on the road ahead.

Captain America, is one of the oldest comic book heroes, up there with Superman and Batman. For some reason, he never had the spotlight like those other two. In fact he was a hero that was practically crapped on with plenty of horrible representations in other various media. With the Avengers story line doing so well in the box office, Marvel finally reached the story line of this superhero, and I am glad to say that Captain America has finally witnessed justice.`Captain America: The First Avenger' is, in fact a prequel to all the other films we have seen until now. It is the story that takes place during World War Two, and the creation of a soldier that was able to take the enemy down. The job was not given to the strongest, or the brashest of men. In fact it was given to a man who was as imperfect as you can get, but his eagerness to put others in front of himself and his want to right wrongs, gave this man the chance to be something great. With that, Captain America was born.This film was so enjoyable, the cast was very well put together. While I was curious about Chris Evans playing this specific hero, I was impressed. The rest of the cast including Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were well placed and fun to watch. What I was happy about the most was the tribute that this film played to Captain America's history in comics, with a lot of references that are scattered throughout the film. To me, this may have been the most accurate depiction of a super hero, even giving Christopher Nolan's Batman a run for its money on accuracy.This is a movie you will like, even if you have never seen any of the other Marvel Studio films, it is a simple, yet complex story and loads of fun.

I have been a Nightwish follower for a little over 1 year now. Since then I have purchased all of their albums before this one and saw them in their very first US concert tour. Nightwish is awesome plain and simple. This album is awesome plain and simple. The sound is a fresh new look at the potential of what heavy metal can and should be. Not dark and depressing but beautiful and inspirational. Thanks to Tarja's amazing vocals and the muscial ability of Tumos and the band...Nightwish has it all. The songs are great but still this is not the album to start with if you're first hearing about this group. 'Once'is pretty much an Americanized version of Nightwish using alot more hard and heavy guitar and alot more male vocals. (not that there is anything wrong with that) Still, songs like 'Ghost Love Score'and 'Creek Mary's Blood'is the old school sound that Nightwish began with and turned into classics such as 'Elvenpath', 'The Riddler' and 'Dead Boy's Poem' However the album is great and thanks to Roadrunner Nightwish now has the ability to grab a whole new bunch of mainstreem fans (I'm talking to all you Slipknot, Soulfly and Type-O-Negative fans!)Welcome to America Nightwish we are glad you're here.

Things are getting darker in the world of wizarding world. 12 years after the dark lord Voldemort disappeared, his loyal followers were tracked down and locked away in Azkaban, the most secure of wizard prisons...or so it was. Now the most feared and dangerous of these prisoners, Sirius Black as escaped and is after none other than 13 year old Harry Potter. While all those who are true to Harry stay close to make sure he is safe Harry can only wonder who this dark soul is and why he is not only out kill him, but the painful fact that links him to the death of Harrys parents.This book is still the fan favorite of the Harry Potter saga, but it surley is the worst of the movies thus far. Don't get me wrong there are some great moments in the movie as well as some great new actors that joined the cast. Gary Oldman was chosen to play Sirius Black and eventhough he is only on screen for the last half hour of the movie he never ceases to amaze with an absolutaly stellar performance. That and the acting of Emma Thompson and comic releif of Rupert Grint is why this movie actully got two stars.What ruined the movie was surley the adaptation of the book to film because it was all out of order the only part that was perfect was the time travel which takes up almost 45 minutes of the movie. The new director Alfonso Curion really focused on Harry and barley any of the other characters. It was as if all the bonds of all the supporting cast memebers were stripped away only so Harry and the new memebers of the cast could have their day in the sun. This is also the shortest of all the movies. I am sure the fans would not have minded an extra 20-30 minutes of movie to watch, especially if it was a scene with the Hogwarts Quiddith Cup finals.Now with the 4th instalment on its way I am hoping that Columbus and the crew learn from their mistakes and if they want to cut out a few things for the sake of cinema and potty breaks they better learn from the disaster that 'Prisoner of Azkaban turned out to be.

What makes this album so good? You have the most creative individual in the music industry returning after a 5 year hiatus teamed up with the most brilliant individual in the business (Dave Grohl)working to create a sheer work of art. This is the album the NIN fans will love and newcomers will get hooked into. The songs are a true culmination of all of Trent's past work. 'Only' is surly the best track because it brings back the new wave sound of Pretty Hate Machine. The rest of the tracks...a huge pleasure to enjoy. This album has the potential to be the best of the year and who knows...maybe even a grammy?

I thought that television had become nothing but a wasteland of reality television until the past 3 years. All of a sudden the return of the great sitcom and now the dramatic television programs on network tv are finally overshadowing HBO. Heroes is the return to glory for NBC because it came into the superhero hype to create an origional story about ordinary people becomeing extraordinary. Unlike the well known super-hero stories Heroes takes a very human look into people from all walks of life discovering they are gifted. The writting is fantastic because it feels like you are reading a comic book. The show is build around visuals and very easy to follow dioligue. This all comes from a guy who had never read comic books in his life and went to some of the most well known in the business to write the first chapter of what could a historical television program. I had not seen this show as it aired on TV but picking up this DVD set showed me that this show really was everything I though it was going to be and I am very much looking forward to seeing where the story will go. I would love to see a team of supervillians in the seasons to come.

You don't need a flashback to Arnolds' diner, a bunch sumos or the muppets to promote this album. Weezers 5th album 'Make Beleive' speaks for itself in all 12 incredible tracks. So maybe there aren't that many whinney depressing songs, but who cares?! There are some new wave elements and some retro 60's beats in this one. Nothing wrong with songs about best friends or living in Beverly Hills either. I also like the message they send in 'We Are All On Drugs'...plain and simple not good stuff. If there is one thing everyone should expect from Weezer is something new and different, but always recognizable at the same time. A band that grows everytime a new album is made gives them the ability to be around for a very long time. Beleive me...after the waiting us Weezer fans went through from 1996 - 2001, it's great to see this foursome back and stronger than ever.

In 2001, the world was introduced to the greatest fairy tale never told. It was the story of a grumpy ogre who just wanted to be left alone and instead was chosen to take the adventure of a lifetime. For 9 years the story of Shrek has been a huge part of film and pop culture and is one of the greatest family film franchises ever. Now, with the 4th and final installment the entire story is being released in a complete box set. It includes a ton of special features including all the holiday specials, which really makes it a true complete collection.Shrek is a great story because it is a well written parody of the traditional fairy tale. It brings all the traditional fairy tale characters and puts a few hysterical spins on them. (My personal favorite is in S4 when the Pied Piper playes 'Sure Shot' on his flute) Also there is a little bit of hostility to Disney throughout the Shrek Saga, because Dreamworks does consist of a few ex-Disneyites so the jokes are pretty obvious digs. The cast is probably the sagas strong point with Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Then you add a ton of other brilliant character actors and comedians and you get comedy gold. The list includes: John Lithgow, John Cleese, Antonio Banderes, Julie Andrews, Justin Timberlake, Larry King, Rupert Everette, Maya Rudolph, Eric Idle, Amy Poeler, Craig Robinson, Meredith Viera and more! Each part of the story is unique, some more likable than others, but if you look at it as a whole it is a great story.Now that the whole story has been told the true point of the story is not about fairy tales and mythical creatures, but life in general. Shrek goes from meeting his true love to taking care of a family and all the hardships and responsibilities that one encounters. Even though the story is meant to be out of the ordinary there are so many relatable features that can be seen in the characters. Shrek is a masterpiece and a treasure in modern cinema. If you purchase the box set I guarantee it will be one of your greatest treasures.

Star Trek, love it or hate it is a piece of entertainment history. 6 television shows, 10 movies and legions and legions of fans follow these iconic sci-fi characters. Now, almost 50 years after the crew of the USS Enterprise beamed into our living rooms Star Trek makes it's return to the big screen...but it's not like the last time.This time around, we are shown a world that is gritter, funnier, and dare I say flashier than your daddy's Star Trek universe. J.J. Abrams has re-vamped Star Trek for a mass audience appeal throwing away most of the traditional sci-fi techno babble and slow moving plots. These elements are replaced with tons of action and simple to follow diologue. A true Star Trek fan would scream bloody murder with matters such as these, but Abrams covers all the bases. He has not done away with the origional Star Trek universe the plot of this new world pays tremendous respects to it's roots with a story that is all about why the universe of Star Trek has been re-vamped beinging in the past. Along with a special appearence by the legendary Leonard Nimoy, he is the one that bridges the gap between the two worlds and passes the torch to the new cast beautifully. 'Star Trek' is the beigning of a brand new generation with an incredible young cast who will hopefully make many more Star Trek films in the coming future and who knows maybe even some new TV shows. The best part about this film is it may be looking like all the haters out there might just start to become 'Trekkies' as well.

Frank Miller has always been one of my favorite comic book writters. He is a great narrator and imaginative story teller. One thing that the brave men who decide to tackle his storys for film know is that they cannnot mold it to the likings of cinema. When Sin City was brought to the big screen I was amazed at how the story was told page for page narritive to action sequence. The breakthrough green screen filming is what totally did it for Frank Miller's story and now it was time to bring another of his masterpieces to the big screen.300 is such an incredible specticle. The story is brilliant as well as the cast. The bullet time fighting sequences are mind blowing. In all of its gore and glory you can't look away and anything that is placed in front of your eyes. This is a movie that you might not get the same thrill of through DVD alone. But if you saw this movie on the big screen you will enjoy it either way.

I first heard the song 'Somebody Told Me' as the number one song on 92.3 K-Rock Furious 5 at 5. (for those of you out of town its a countdown on NYC's alternative rock station.)Once I heard the name of ther artist I sampled more tracks. I was floored and bought it the next day. It is amazing to see a new group that could easily go the way of all the coprate rock bands and instead go the way of 80's new wave. The use of synthesizer and style of vocals really brings back the names 'Tears For Fears', 'The Cure' and 'New Order'. This is perhaps the begining of a revinvention of a sound that has been lost for over 20 years. It is a sound almost everyone loves and doesn't want to forget and yes we even want it back. Even if The Killers never make another album and vanish off the face of the Earth I will say this...your attempt was bold and will be remembered for a job well done.

I mean....OH NO SCOOGE!!! Consider this part 2 of my first trilogy of reviews (check volume 1 for the begining.) As the second volume was released my love for Zim grew...and grows bigger than my love for Game Slave II!!! This DVD really brings out all the greatness in all the other characters with episodes staring Dib Gaz and yes even Scooge! What makes this volume so great? The characters get nuttier the episodes get weirder and most importantly 'Hobo 13' is the greatest episode ever! I don't know what Nickelodeon was thinking. The highlights in this dvd inicluce...'Plague of Babies', 'Bloaties Pizza Hog' 'Hobo 13' 'Game Slave II' and of course 'Lice' because it kept me up all night it was so creepy. To make a long review short sit down shut up and enjoy. It's what Scooge would have wanted...I mean...OH NO SCOOGE!!!

I had seen my very first episode of Invader Zim in my junior year of college. My friend had 5 episodes in a burned disc and I just thought it would be just your typical everyday Nicktoon. Never would I have excpected this show to be so eerie and sometimes nasuiating but at the same time flat out hillarious! This show blends the essence of classic Nicktoon comedy like Ren &amp; Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life with a bit of the twisted anime action and humor (kids jumping out of second story windows when school is out.) I Was officially hooked when GIR (A hyperactive Meatwad) made his first apperence and sang the DOOM song, because he just rules! Unfortunatly I had gotten into this show too late because it already had been canceled by hoards of angry parents saying this was not a kids show. WELL DUH! It wasn't ment for kids otherwise it would be on tv at noon rather than prime time! Why do all the good shows die so soon? (The Critic, The Oblongs, Mission Hill: may they rest in peace.) I was hoping to have seen Zim join the rest of the adult swim crew, but a season dvd is so much better. Once again we have triumphed over moder society and are able to get back our sick, twisted and tremendously funny programs to be watched over and over and over. WE SHALL BRING DOOM TO YOU ALL!!!

I have know about the fabled 3rd album of this power pop/punk band for quite sometime. The fact that it didn't even get made in the states after what seemed to me as a very strong sophmore release. Yet, I digress and I suddenly find out it is here so of course I went to get it.I was happy to hear the familiar sound of this band and finally having an album with a few songs I had been able to snag like the origonal version of '1985' and their great cover of Peter Gabriels' 'In Your Eyes' However, I have to say that this album was a bit of a let down. This album is by no means awful, but there are just not as many songs that are as enjoyable to listen to. I am not a big fan of songs like 'Blue Light Special Life or Blood and Bourbon'. Even some decent songs like 'All American and 'Here We Go Again' just don't have the same pop as songs like 'Mosquito' or 'Everything'. The album is just not as great a package like the first two albums.Still, the album is finally here and I get to complete my collection for the time being. The album having a US release is giving us hope now that there is a 4th album in the works, so who knows this could in fact be a small step towards a huge comback. Especially with so many bands from the late 1990's suddenly emerging from out of the woodwork. Who knoes that the future will bring to SR-71.

When people ask me wha my favorite movie is I always say it's more about directors rather that actual titles. Martin Scorcesse never lets me down in that department. This year he graces the movie going public with yet another exciting and all out fun shoot'em up twisted up masterpiece in 'The Departed'How can you say anything bad about this movie? I had spoken to about 20-35 different people who had seen this movie in the theaters and not once did I hear a single negative word towards it. The cast couldn't get any better, this is the best cast Scorcesse put together since Goodfellas. Matt Damon Boston native extrodiare and Leo DiCaprio put on probably their best performances of their careers and each were in two very well put together movies on their own this same year. I was shocked that neither got a nomination for best actor for this movie. Eventhough DiCaprio got a nomination for Blood Diamond it was a stll a shock. The great Jack never lets you down with his intimidating on screen presence and his signature wit and classic quotables. Probably the best performace in this movie was Mark Walberg. He was a power house and really knew how to do that Bostonian accent to a tee.All and all if you are a fan of great mob movies its your movie. If you are into big casts its your movie. If you are into artsy films that can possibly win best picture of the year...oh wait too late, it is winner for you. This is one of those movies you will probably watch a million times and finally credit was given where credit was sorely due.

I definitely feel the need to post these next two reviews. These two were landmarks for me because I really feel I put more effort into them. I got down to the nitty gritty of the products based on other customer reviews as well at my own findings. Hope you my reader will approve. I noticed that this one got 2 out of 3 posstive approvals.There it was just lying on a Best Buy shelf, waiting for a mother of small children or a serious `80's buff to buy it and believe me 10 bucks is a sweet deal for such a rarity. I first got into the Care Bears when I was 4 now I'm 21 and proud to say I still care for these cool bears. This full-length film is criticized as being an hour long commercial to sell merchandise based on the new Care Bear Cousins. Though it seems to be true after watching it, I realized there is something more.As the Care Bears travel to an Earth gone mad they are being followed by the cause of the madness. A friendless boy possessed by an evil spirit bent on turning the whole world into a wasteland of hatred. Watch this movie again if you have it or are totally against it, because you might learn a thing or two about the Care Bears. This movie proves that the Care Bears are not invincible. The Care Bear Cousins provide the extra strength and ability the Care Bears could not supply alone. Some of these examples include aqua abilities (Cozy Heart Penguin), air ability (Playful Heart Monkey) and night vision (Bright Heart Raccoon) just to name a few. Plus the song and scene where the Cousins get their tummy symbols is always fun to watch.The movie's story is not as good as the second, but what I like about this one, is the fact that all the care bears actually say at least one line each, even Secret Bear! If you are a new fan or an old school fan, let this review be a reminder that the Care Bears are back! Who knows, there may even be another movie.

I am happy to announce that I have recovered lost reviews of mine from various account names I forgot my password to. I am hoping that Amazon will allow me to finally post all my reviews as a whole! Enjoy!!!Straovarius can only be sumed up on one word...origional. While the world of heavy metal music is pretty much on the verge of death, Stratovarius steps in to say "Hell No!" Stratovarius shows the listener that metal does not have to be dark and depressing and does not need to include graphic content. The lyrics and vocals as well as the amazing musicianship fills you with motivation and hope in a time where it is needed the most. Strat has come a long way from "Fright Night" taking a one of a kind blend of blood pumping guitar and mixing it perfectly with a beautiful classical score. The album includes great concepts from political messages towards the war on terror, to a song dedicated to the movie "The Neverending Story." My only dissapointment was the fact that the song "Run Away" which is included on the "Eagleheart" single was not included on the actual album. I recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a sound with depth and meaning rather than pointless bubble gum pop. Their sound is truthful and wholesome, but very very loud! Elements Pt.1 ranks up there with Strat's other masterpieces such as Visions and Infinate I highly suggest looking into those albums as well I am eagerly awating Pt.2.Now go to the very last page of my reviews so you can see what happened when 'Elements Pt.2' was released. I will pretty much sum up where this band is in my world.

I have already reviewed the past 3 seasons of this incredible show. There really isn't more to say. Robot Chicken is one of the most origonal shows in the history of television. It's so funny and there is never a dull moment. This volume is just more of the madness that has been given to us for the past 5 years! The best thing to say is because of this shows success Seth Green has created another marvel. So buy this dvd and enjoy and let's home Titan Maximum season 1 hits shevles soon!

I am going to take the time to answer in full detail the two questions that seem to be causing consumers to pull their hair out just as crazed as Homer did in 'Maggie Makes Three'. 1: Yes you can get a replacement box, because quite frankly the Homer head sucks as a dvd box (But is quite nice for a display) In the package there is an order for a replacemet slip case ...SLIP CASE PEOPLE!!! Its black its got Homer looking through a magnifying glass with maggie, smithers and groundskeeper willy behind him. You still have to take the contensts of the Homer package and just slip them in there is no slit for the booklet or plastic holders for the disks. This offer is only for two types of people. Those who are extremly frightened of change (BUY ELECTRIC CARS THE STONE CUTTERS ARE NOT HOLDING IT BACK!) and those who just love free stuff (Yes there is a 3 buck S&H, but what else can you get these days for 3 bucks?) 2: If you watch the end of season 12 on Simpsons behind the laughter The Simpsons and Springfield are in Northern Kentucky...it is said clearly. Plus if you watch the episode with the Who in season 12 you get the Simpsons Phone Number. Hopefully you will all get the much needed sleep you all deserve obsessing over all of this. Oh....Season 6 kicks A$$

A great musical talent can make its mark in many different ways, musical, scandelous what have you. But the way for any band to stand the test of time is to always find new sounds that will be able the grab the approval of its loyal fan base many times over. Billy Corgan, one of the well known voices from the 90's alternative grunge scene made his mark throughout the 90's with the ever popular Smashing Pumpkins. Until 2000 they filled the radio waves with unique gloomy musicianship, haunting harmonies and of course Billy's original singing voice. The band broke up feeling there was no place for them where music was going and Billy still tried to keep his music alive through many different side projects, but it still didn't seem to reach out to his fans without the now legendary Smashing Pumpkins name.Now in 2007 The Smashing Pumpkins are back, but not whole (minus James Iha and D'Arcy. Yet, this new rencarnation it bringing a major message to the legions of fans that have waited for this moment. It is not right to dwell on the past we must venture forward. And Venture Billy and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin have. 'Zeitgiest' is a breath of fresh air in the music scene but it is also a great listen. It is not the signature gloomy heavy but now it a loud fast sometime possitive heavy. The first track 'Doomsday Clock' is already making headway by appearing on the soundtrack of the biggest movie this summer so far, Transformers. The guitars are fast the harmonies have vastly improved and Jimmy Chamberlin really brings out his old school drumming in all the tracks. Some of the best songs on this album are Tarantula, Starz and Come On Let's Go. These songs pretty much take Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan and create some sort of a hybrid that really gets you into it. Also there is tribute to the loyal fans with a few slower and softer songs like Neverlost and For God and Country. These songs use the unique gloom and strange use of Synthesizer and even a Xylephone. This album was well worth the wait and it is great to hear this band again. Hopefully this album will mark a new chapter in Billy Corgans career that will allow this band to stick around for the years to come and continue to bring us great music. More importantly this will hopefully reunite the band as a whole so we can all proudly say The Smashing Pumpkins are back!

Do you remember your childhood? It was an innocent time, full of wonders that were yours and yours alone. When the real world got you down you always knew that your world was waiting for you. Then as you got older things were changing all around you in ways you couldn't understand and at the same time your world was no longer a place you wanted to escape to. That is what the whimsical world of Max is all about in `Where The Wild Things Are.'Based on one of the most beloved children's book, we are brought into the world of Max. He is a boy with a fierce imagination and is always looking for others to join him in his adventures. Apparently there was a time when plenty of people were part of his world. Now things are not as fun as they use to be. He is having a hard time being ignored by his teenaged sister and doesn't seem to understand why his mom is so wrapped up in work and dating other men since the passing of his dad. One night he realizes he just can't take it anymore and runs away. He finds is a lonely row boat that takes him to a far off place. There he finds a whole bunch of large creatures that just want to play and have just as much fun as Max. They welcome Max into their world and make him their king. As King Max tried to bring the two worlds together, but something happens especially with one of the creatures named Carol (Played by James Gandolfini) After that Max suddenly realizes that sometimes even when you trying to escape from your troubles they will always find away to catch up and the only way to make them go away is to face them.Where The Wild Things are is not a fantastic movie, nor is it horrible. It is a very original style of film making that you don't see too often, so it takes a little bit of getting use to. This movie was a real risk on director Spike Jonze. To take a book that has no more than 9 lines of dialogue and create a whole world out of it is nothing short of brilliant. This movie unfortunately can send many mixed signals, especially to parents of young children. Despite the PG rating this is not a film for kids. This movie is mature in nature, it's about a child trying to cope with growing up. It may have its elements of fantasy and big fuzzy creatures, but these big fuzzy creatures are as real as real can be. They suffer because of the anarchy they live in and just want to be set strait and given direction and Max wants to get away from all of that. He realizes that being a king takes a lot of hard work and responsibility and he discovers that some times only thinking about you can lead to torn friendships and hurting hearts. It's a movie that really tugs at all of your emotions. It's a movie especially for us who love the story will appreciate. It was a movie that was made for the grown-up in all of us to remember the joys and hardships of being young again. Again, it is a very different style of film, but it is so creative and full of wonder it is not to be missed.

The journey that began with an innocent young boy discovering the world he belonged to comes to an end in an explosive and emotional finale in `The Deathly Hallows Part 2'.It is just so amazing to see how far these actors who were practically no names changed into incredible young men and women that managed to give such great performances for the final time. What started as an incredible drama ends in a fast paced battle between good and evil in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Still, in all the explosions and special effects the film is filled with emotion in two ways. The final film ties together the whole story, including some major revelations in Harrys' world and certain characters. Of course the main event in this film is the final showdown between himself and the one who wanted him dead ever since he was a child.Personally I felt that there was just a little bit missing from this film, but as a whole especially seeing it along with `The Deathly Hallows Part 1' it does a great job giving the fans the ending they have been expecting to see. As a whole I am happy to say that while these films may not have been as great as the books themselves, they were by no means horrible films. I am so excited to finally have my complete collection of Harry Potter films and I intend to enjoy them again and again.If you have read all my reviews of all 8 Harry Potter Films...thank you. Please check me out my Harry Potter film documentary on YouTube at smdelta4.

After spending a month watching Studio Ghibli films I had to write a review on one of the most overlooked animated movies. 'The Iron Giant' is a story of a young boy named Hogarth growing up during the Cold War who comes acorss a giant robot. Like most young boys when they come across a giant robot is to make friends with it. Now he has to keep him hidden from a worrysome mother and paranoid government agent. This is one of the most heartfelt movies I have ever seen and it's not even a Disney movie. The characters are so well made and voices chosen really allow them to connect with the viewers. I loved how the movie really depicted the time of the innocent 1950's with all the pop culture references as well. Still the bond between Hogarth and the Iron Giant is heartwarming and real you will want to watch this movie again and again.

Dreamworks comes up big with How To Train Your Dragon. It is a very simple to follow story about a boy who's father is of major importance in the time of Vikings. Yet Hiccup does not inherit the strong burly momentum that his father does. So instead of going up against his tribes enemies, the dragons he is sent to work as the lowest of the low in the fight, until he decided to accidentially trap one of the rarest of the rare. When his father finds out he did he is proclaimed a hero and when he finds his catch he tries to do something none of his tribe has ever done...learn to befriend it and understand it. What Hiccup uncovers is a major secret in the world of Dragons and that there is a way to put a stop to years and years of rivalry.This movie will make you laugh and make you feel true emotions as it portrays a classic Father Son tale. The cast is amazing from the leading role played by Jay Barruchel all the way to Craig Ferrgeson. Dreamworks, while they don't always create a gem like Pixar tends to do, comes up strong with this one. It is a great movie and you will definitely enjoy it.

The magical world finally stands united now that the Dark Lord has made his presence known. Now no one is safe except for those to choose his side. Be it a wizard or muggle Voldemort has his sights set one finally completing his mission, but he must eliminate the chosen one. Harry Potter, is about to enter his sixth year at Hogwarts. This time, besides being closely watched over by the watchful and caring Albus Dumbledore Harry must face a new challenge, being a normal teenaged boy with his thoughts fixated on girls. Friendships and dating is swimming all throughout the corridors at Hogwarts and it's much more complicated than any Quidditch match. Still, Harry must stay focused because he can sense that there is a plot afoot to penetrate the walls of Hogwarts and turn the haven of wizarding youth into a spawning ground for Death Eaters. The questions that need to be answered are who is plotting it, whom are they after and who is working with them on the inside. There are many secrets revealed about Voldemorts past in this chapter, but most importantly this is the point in time when Harry Potter finally makes the choice on what he must do to finally take down his nemesis.There were many mixed reviews about this film, but as a fan who read this book when it was first released this was my favorite installment (Meaning it surpases 'Chamber of Secrets'). What grabbed me the most was this book made things a little lighter after two extremely dark novels. It was a much more human story showing that while there is a classic story of good versus evil in an imaginative world these young witches and wizards are still just ordinary teenagers with ordinary problems. Bringing David Yates back to direct this film was the best choice because in 'Order Of The Phoenix' he brought realism to the characters and deep development within themselves and with one another. Tackling love and heartbreak is a very hard thing to do in a Sci-Fi fantasy film, but Yates nailed it. The story was also very funny as the book was. The characters show fears in the areas on popularity or just manning up to tell a girl how he felt. Tom Felton who has played Draco was finally given a chance to show his acting potential. While there was minimal dialogue until the very end his body language showed true emotional that really worked the crowd. The fact that a boy who has always boasted about being a proud dark wizard can shed tears when he faces his true self was made so believable by Felton. I sure hope that once these films have concluded he is given a chance for more work and many stellar performances.If you agree with this review then like me this will be a Harry Potter film you will enjoy. We now look forward to the final chapter going Hoarcrux on us to bring us the entire final book page by page. It looks as though they want to do the finale correctly so expect nothing less than a PG-13 rating.

The films of Studio Ghibli are acclaimed all over the world. As a whole the films are nothign less than wonderous, but singled out like always there are some bad apples in the bunch.'Howl's Moving Castle' is the story of a girl that has her youth taken from her by an old witch. She then stumbles upon the strange, but mystical Howl. A handsome man that has a strange power...or curse. He lives in an abstract moving home that has a few interesting things in it. A young apprentice that changes his face in order to do business in 3 different worlds. A flame in a furnace that talks and a strange scarecrow that has a strange urge to follow the bewitched girl where ever she goes.As you can see I really don't have much to say about this film. Honestly I found it quite dull and boring. The only thing I liked about it was that the english version used Billy Crystal as one of the voices so he has his moments. Other than that I was a bit upset to see that the Howl character was nothing more than a big whining baby with a strange inferiority complex. Again this is only my opinon, but people do like this film so it's like I always say don't knock it until you try it.

Justice League was one of my all time favorite shows. I mean when you're in your early 20's with a full time job watching a show like Justice League it really makes people wonder about what this show is all about. With this brand new film Bruce Timm is really taking the step to keep the older fans interested in his work by maturing the story lines as well as the characters.The New Fronier is based on the forming of the Justice League through a writter and artist with a huge passion for the silver age of DC comics. With the film adaption Bruce Timm went out of his way to find new voices for his cahracters to really bring out the 50's theme with a little bit of takiness but at the same time really trying to bring out the thematic elements that revolved around the story. At points it can be a little confusing to the watcher, but for me the Cold War was a bit confusing all together.This movie will make a great addition to your comic film collection. It's a great story eventhough it doesn't involve all the characters in depth, it capture a bit history as well as the evolution of the comic book industry if you look hard enough. I am very excited for the next Bruce Timm film and I am so happy to know he and his staff are still not through with their work.

After Elements Pt.1 was released I was running all over the place converting fans left and right and constantly saying just wait for Pt.2! Thank goodness I was the first one of all my friends to buy it...it gave me enough time to give them my input before they all got it. I was expecting Pt. 2 to be the `Empire Strikes Back' of sequel albums, but instead it was more like `The Matrix Reloaded'. Elements Pt.2 is not a terrible album, but like another band I love `Dream Theater' it was as if they didn't try hard enough to bring something new to the fans. There are highlights in this new album such as `I Walk To My Own Song', `Awaken The Giant', `Luminous', `Dream Weaver' (A grand duet between the two Kotepito and Tolkki) and `Liberty'. The rest makes you say to yourself "Heard it before." Or, "It was great the first time I heard it." It was almost as if something was up with the band itself and it turns out there was. Now with Strat looking for a new drummer and lead singer, you can't stop but wonder...Elements Pt. 2 could have been the last great Stratovarius album. For their sake I hope after the band is rebuilt their next album is something great.

'Toy Story' was a landmark film for Disney and animation in general. After the mediocre second film in Pixar's 'A Bugs Life', the toys decided to come back to town. Now, of course with any sequel loads of questions come pouring in as well as a great deal of skepticism. A sequel rarely lives up to its predecessor and history had shown that a great deal. While the plot was told to the fans way before the movies released, it sounded great, but no one was going to say anything until the movie hit theaters. In 1999 the world was graces with 'Toy Story 2' and did it live up to the original? The answer is yes!'Toy Story 2' did a great deal of things that were right on target to making a great movie. The first positive was bringing the cast back. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen reprised their roles as Woody and Buzz and just did what they did in the first movie. Of course with a new movie it means new toys. We are introduced to some great new characters that have just as an important role to play as the originals. While it may take a little time to get use to as the movie reaches it's end you are left quite satisfied. The second positive was the story its self. This new movie put these wonderful characters into a much larger situation than just hanging around in Andy's room. The toys encounter the challenges of the outside world, at least for a toy and the humor that is thrown in as well as a few movie references all worked perfectly. Of course along with the adventure side of the movie another major positive in this movie comes with a very emotional and very real message. 'Toy Story 2' introduces the fans to the concept of children growing up and leaving their toys behind. The message is summed up by the new character Jessie and a wonderful song preformed by Sarah MacLauchlan. The montage that goes with the song is just so real and somber you can't believe that this is something that ends up in a movie like Toy Story. I think that is why people of all ages love this movie. It's because of the fact that Pixar, while it has the opportunity to make a sequel, they want it to be loved by everyone. Pixar films, while they may gross millions at the box office are just filled with so much emotion and heart. Since the first 'Toy Story', there have been 10 Pixar films added to the library and so many people love them, quote them and even own them. Each one is such a great film and filled with so much that people appreciate and it's because of the thought and heart that is added to each distinct film is why they are appreciated as much as they are.'Toy Story 2', now that the third and hopefully final installment has been added, is probably the weakest of the 3 films. Still, it is not to say that 2 is a bad film. It's probably because of the fact that 'Toy Story 2' was just a little larger and deeper and it takes just a bit of time to get use to. Once you have seen the final installment, you will find out just how important this film is to the saga and it will make you appreciate it so much more. I enjoyed 'Toy Story 2' so much and would recommend it to anyone young or old.

Dreamworks is having a very hard time trying to keep up the genuine perfection of PIXAR. Since these guys probably believe they never will surpass them the next best thing is to just make fun of them and everything else. So because of that mentality we get the latest DreamWorks film Monsters VS. Aliens.MvA is the story of a young woman named Susan ready to take the next step in her life and marry the man of her dreams. Suddenly she is exposed to a meteor and starts to become a `big' problem. Now she is government property, has made a bunch of interesting new friends and is now part of a team that has been assembled to take down threats that the average man may not be able to handle. Her first mission, stop an alien invasion! Not too bad for the next step in Susan's life.Monsters VS Aliens is a laugh out loud comedy that really appeals to a very diverse audience. There are numerous references to Sci-Fi pop culture and of course the Monsters in the movie pay tribute to all the classic B horror films of the 1950 until today. Some of those examples include, `The Creature of the Black Lagoon', `The Blob' and The `Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'. The cast is fantastic and of course we all knew that Seth Rogan would steal the show as he always does. Some of the other cast members include Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie and believe it or not a whole new side of Keifer Sutherland. What I loved about this movie was the fact that Stephen Colbert played the president and probably delivered the best line in the whole movie. I applaud `Monsters VS Aliens' for its original tribute to the Sci-Fi parody and it is definitely one of the few DreamWorks films that is very much worth the money. Since `Shrek' there really hasn't been a truly great DreamWorks animation film. (This is not including anything made by the Aardmen Studios). I have to say I am very excited for future DreamWorks parody projects. The two known ones on the horizon are `How To Train Your Dragon' which is a take on fantasy stories and `Oobermind' which is a take on Superheroes and comic books. Let's see what happens.

The finale that we have awaited for, for the past 10 years has finally arrived. Harry Potter has been through quite a lot in his past 6 years at Hogwarts, but now it is time to make the full transition from child to adult.For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome. This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray. Before Blu Ray was released they managed to give us just as many special features on DVDs and now since Blu Ray at least to me is nothing but a space saver the film industry is literally taking a massive dump on DVDs. I have watched DVDs and yes the picture is clearer, but it is the film itself that makes me enjoy what they are.

The Killers are really something special in the world of music today. There are a band that uses meloncholy new wave sound that is able to put smiles on peoples faces and have them sing along. 'Hot Fuss' was a real coming out for this band but their new cd 'Sam's Town' is not getting the same vibes from many people. This new album has the fans split right down the middle. The first single 'When You Were Young' is just not getting the same feeling as 'Somebody Told Me.' Yet this group is not going in the wrong direction. This is a band like many before them that plans to stick around for while by experimenting and trying new things to see how far they can go. Those types of bands are the ones that stand the test of time. 'Sam's Town' is a real triump there are great songs on this record and even some that keep the origional Killers sound. Songs like 'Bones' and 'See My Mind' keep the fans interested while the rest are a new breath of fresh air which is what the music world so desperatly needs. So take a listen and try and keep an open mind.

You could tell from the ending of the first `Karate Kid' that this was only the beginning of the story. The continuing journey of Daniel LaRusso bursts wide open in 'The Karate Kid Part II' Mr. Miyagi must return to his home land of Okinawa to see his dying father, but he is also well aware that the scars of his past are still there waiting for him after all this time. Daniel learns of Mr. Miyagi's best friend Sato and how Miyagi broke the village tradition to ask for the hand of his best friend's betrothed wife. Daniel learns through his trip that karate is more than tournaments and trophies. He learns that it is about honor and pride. He soon understands that there are people who take honor very seriously that they will stop at nothing seek out the purity of honor if it has been disgraced. That means anything is possible, even a fight to the death. Only through the sacred rules and techniques of the Miyagi family karate can Daniel overcome the tremendous obstacles he will face at this step in his journey.This movie is one of the fabled sequels that live up to its predecessor. The story is darker and Pat Morita's performance is his best by far. I am surprised that he didn't get nominated a second time for an academy award. The villains are just as evil as the Cobra Kais (who actually make a brief appearance in the film) and the final fight shows that karate is not about fancy moves and glory. The message learned from `Part II' is that when it comes to fighting the most powerful technique is the one that your opponent doesn't see.

Between the hyjinx of `Ghostbusters' and the use of bananas to fight crime in `Beverly Hills Cop', there was `The Karate Kid'. It still amazes me that a 23 year old Ralph Macchio plays a 17 year old adolescent from Jersey, anyway what can be said about this film. `The Karate Kid' is a fun coming of age film with a huge heart to go with it. Daniel LaRusso arrives in California only to discover that it's not the same as the East Coast. He is labeled as an outcast by the powerful, rich elite of The Valley who comes down upon him at full force with a brutal and violent form of karate. Daniel sees that even learning karate is no the place for him, as he sees the local sensei (The Evil John Kreese) is just as cruel and merciless. Daniel is determined not to seek revenge, but to gain respect and acceptance as an equal in his new home. Befriending his apartments handyman Mr. Miyagi (The late Pat Morita), he learns that the true nature of karate comes from the will to be true to yourself and that if you are pure at heart you can accomplish anything. That also includes catching flies with chop sticks.This movie is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. The acting is amazing and the characters are unforgettable. It is one of those movies that stands the test of time and can be enjoyed by all ages. The last scene in this movie is probably one of the most memorable in movie history. It is when Daniel used the `Crane' technique to beat is nemesis Johnny Lawrence only to receive the trophy from the exact same person with a look of respect and a statement to match. I agree with that statement and that is what true movie magic is all about. As Johnny said..."You're alright LaRusso!"

What better way to end the saga of Daniel LaRusso than a final installment in `The Karate Kid Part III'. There was only one major problem...it was a great idea done terribly wrong. The story takes place right after Part II, where a sinister plot is hatched by the true villain of `The Karate Kid' saga, John Kreese. John pays a visit to Terry Silver, fellow soldier turned millionaire scumbag and loyal Cobra Kai. Kreese tells Terry of his downfall thanks to Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and Terry is more than willing to help his friend get his revenge. They hire a violent up and coming fighter named Mike Barnes to force Daniel to fight him for the All Valley Tournament title. Daniel is still true to the Miyagido style of karate and would rather spend his days helping Mr. Miyagi with their new business in Banzai trees. When Daniel is threatened under unavoidable circumstances, Terry jumps in to pose as a friend and teacher to Daniel. Learning a new more violent style of karate from Terry causes extreme tension between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. For too long Miyagi taught Daniel that Karate was not about defending a title and Daniel is torn apart wondering why he has strayed from his friends teachings. No sooner when Daniel discovers that he was played for sap, Mr. Miyagi re-unites with Daniel not for revenge, but to prove the point that has been shown throughout the entire saga. One must be pure in heart and true to his honor in order to emerge a champion.I gave this film a low rating because the movie as a whole did not live up to the plot. What knocks Part III down from the rest of the story is the sub par acting. `The Karate Kid Part III' comes off looking a lot like `3 Ninjas', with its cartoonish villainy and Ralph Macchio just whines too much. Not even the heavy use of adult language and the major role of John Kreese could save this movie. This movie could have been made much better because the premise of this story is quite good and it does work. I guess it was the staff, letting the movie going public know it was time to put an old dog to sleep. Unfortunately they didn't, but I'm not even going there. If you are a fan of `The Karate Kid' as a whole you will watch this movie more than once and really make an effort to enjoy it. Still, there will be a voice in the back of your mind saying...Sorry LaRusso...you lost this time.

I have praised the bizarre world of Haruhii Suzumiya, I could never imagine a world without her. Then from out of nowhere this movie comes out.`The Disappearance of Haruhii Suzumiya' picks up right where the show left off when one day Kyon wakes up in a world that seems a little off. Suddenly he realizes no one he has gotten close to remembers him at all and even worse the person who knows him the most is nowhere to be found. Now Kyon has to find out where Haruhii has gone and more importantly where he is!This show is great, but the movie is something truly special. While there is very little of the paranormal in this movie what makes up for it is the characters in this story. You will experience a true emotional rollercoaster in this film and there are moments where your jaw will hit the floor in wonderment. You do have to see the show beforehand because this movie has links that go back to many episodes of the show. So like Kyon if you have not seen the two seasons of The Melancholy of Haruhii Suzumiya, you will be lost.I have seen much anime in my life including `Grave of the Fireflies' which is one of the great films I have ever seen period, but this one comes pretty close on a character driven standpoint. Even if Anime is not your cup of tea, this is a story that really shows you how characters can make a movie work so well. All I am hoping of is after such a great chapter in this story that it is far from over. I am hoping there is a third season of the show on the horizon real soon.

If you are a fan of Mr. Labrie with Dream Theater do not let this album pass you by. 'Elements of Persuasion' is a masterpiece. It has everything a true appreciator of music loves. James is just as good as he is with the boys of Dream Theater and doesn't do anything drastic like changing his picth or anything else you would expect from an artist that would make a solo record.There is however something that he does change. he wants the fans to know that this is his work and not Dream Theaters and the way he does that is through the band he uses and the style of the music. Instead of just good old fassioned Dream Theater Progressive metal he uses alot of trance and industrial elements in the music. The songs are also not extremly long epics they are just good old fassioned 3 to 5 minute songs. I mean I am not knocking Dream Theater in anyway. This is just a good way to listen to Dream Theater music in a different light much like Liquid Tension Experiment. The highlights on this album are Oblivious, Lost, Alone and Slightly out of Reach. Pick it up you will not be disappointed.

It's here, the next installment in the line-up of hits from the DC Animated Universe. Everytime one of these movies is released not only am I eager to see the film. I am also always excited to see the preview for their next project. The Green Lantern seemed to a project that the entire staff was very eager to do most likley because the Green Lantern is one of the DC comic chatacters that has not been given much face time outside of the comic books. The Green Lantern is probably one of the most popular comic characters next to the major DC heavy hitters. Probably because of the creativity of the characters, the complexity of the universe GL is in. Or maybe, just that awesome pledge he says.'Green Lantern: First Flight' really is the very first Green Lantern movie period and I have to admit as much as I was anticipating to opportunity to see it I was still very much surprised. This film is more than just an origin stroy. In fact it really is the story after the origin. The premise of this film is now that Hal Jorden is The Greeen Lantern what happened after that? The story is more about what it takes to be a Green Lantern. The viewer is taken on a roller coaster of a story as the members of the Green Lantern Corp take care of business. Busting crime throughout the universe and of course beating up the baddies. Yet, while they believe everything is fine, there may just be a baddie among them. The viewer of course will get a kick out this film because while it may be Hal Jordans' first mission he is being trained by his future arch nemesis Sinestro. Hal definitely picked an interesting time to be chosen.Like the previous projects from Bruce Timm and company, this one is just as gritty and exciting as it's predecessors. This movie is a great origional story for Green Lantern fans. It's got Hal Jordan, Sinestro and the Green Lantern history everything a Green Lantern fan craves in an orginal 'Training Day' like story. The voices for the characters are well matched and the action is great, with a few unexpected plot twists and surprises. Now I think the guys working on the 2011 live action Green Lanter movie should definitely check this one out...it could give them a couple of pointers.

This recovered and FINAL review means a lot to me. This one was given my very first perfect score. It got 6 out of 6 approvals. After this review I stopped writting for a while and lost my original password. Notice that my name is 'Underground Reborn' So I am glad that everyone that has been reading almost 200 of my reviews will be able to finally read my complete work. Now that I have found these two reviews of the Care Bears movies, maybe it's only proper I review all the other 1980s cartoon movies! Let's see what happens.Before I review this film, I decided to answer the question so many reviewers have posted on Amazon in the past. The question is: How is it possible to have only met the Care Bear Cousins in the first movie and end up knowing them all along in the sequel? The answer couldn't be simpler. The Second full length Care Bears movie is entitled: The Care Bears Move II: A New Generation. This means it is an entirely different world.I am not ashamed to admit that I am a 21-year-old male who is a fan of these `80s's pop culture icons. Most boys I grew up with like myself watched the show along with all the cool stuff the `80's had to offer and we all had at least one doll. I was the proud owner of Champ Bear thank you very much. The second movie is a very interesting one now that I look back on it. After finding my old copy I realized this movie was a little extreme for young children. The villain is a demon and there are very serious situations that kids wouldn't understand like the scene where Dark Heart almost drowns. Yes even though he is a demon if you knock your self out you can drown. All and all the movie has a great easy to follow story, great sound track and leaves you with a positive attitude. It also has great action and proves that the Care Bears not only care about the well being of Earth's children, but they care about their own family just as much.Still, I felt there were some very disappointing things about the second installment. 1) Even though we were introduced to a new Care Bear named Harmony (Dark purple with one red heart and two small pink hearts flanking it), did you ever notice that Treat Heart Pig was not in the movie at all? All you true fans should look very carefully she isn't there and she became one of the most popular characters in the last few seasons of the animated series. 2) Where are Grams Bear and Hugs and Tugs? They were all in the first movie, but if they were not in the second one, how did they end up Care -A- Lot? Think about it, Grams Bear should have been the first Care Bear instead of the other new characters True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse. 3) This is my biggest beef, barely any of the Care Bears actually played a part in this movie. Their names were mentioned, but none of them said anything! In the first movie every Care Bear has at least one line, but not all the Cousins. I was into the Care Bears just as much as Transformers and He-Man, but never in my life have I ever heard the voices of Loyal Heart Dog or Proud Heart Cat. They made appearances in both films, but not once did either say a single word. Oh yea and what's with the gender changes? Some were no big deal, but I'll tell you this...BIRTHDAY BEAR IS A DUDE! Anyway besides these issues, Care Bears II is a great buy for all ages. Whether young or old no one will be disappointed. Still, it would be cool to see a Care Bears III, one that could appeal to the old fans like me.

I have said this before and I will say it again. If it wasn't for Kevin Costner, 'Goodfellas' would have recieved the best picture honor in 1990. Martin Scorcese for the past 20 years has given us some of the most meorable movies of our generation. They have a very similar theme and tend to use the same actors as well. Now, we are given 'Shutter Island', which is a step away from the usual and giving us something fresh.I had no idea that this film was based on a comic book, but seeing the trailers and knowing how well DiCaprio works with Scorcese I was very eagar to see how this movie turned out. The movie was a good watch, but there were a few flaws to it. Still, I don't want to rip this film because this was a brave move by Scorcese. He decided to break the usual mafia mold and give us a psychological thriller. We do have the Scorcese elements such as the large amount of 'F' bombs and the whole 1950s/1960s gangster/detective vibe which he loves to do. Still, The acting was great, especially in the every end when the truth about Shutter Island was revield. DiCaprio's performace throughout the movie was good, but bland at times until the very end. His character took a huge twist and the dramatic turn her took was just incredible it made up for the last hour and a half. The movie I felt was too predictable. I pretty much figured out what was going on about half way into the movie. As a whole package it was definitely something new from a director who's work I enjoy.My thoughts on 'Shutter Island', take the time to see it. It was a new step in Martin Scorcese's career I would love to see if he intends to continue trying new genres of film. While predictable it is still enjoyable.

I have always said it takes absolute genius to create utter stupidity. 'Robot Chicken' proves that I am right. This is a show that has everything a avid television fan could ever want. It captures the essence of everything television is about, from channel surfing to reality tv and it is shown through stop motion camera. Yep, you don't need extremely expensive effects to creat good television. All you need is a ton of clay and a bunch of old action figures and barbie dolls. Then have them all do things from going on space adventures, have them lured by satan to do nothing but watch TIVO, and yes go at it on the dinning room table in their trailer park home. What could be any better?What is so great about this show is that it wanted to capture the very essance of television in modern society. Yes, that is extremly far fetched but if you think about it its true. Each episode only lasts about 10 minutes and is basically the day in the life of someone flipping through channels. The show says whatever it wants to say and everything you never had the guts to say. This is a must have for all those with a sick sence of humor and love for anything pop culture. But please don't try any of the things you see on this show at home. In other words....DON'T PUT THE BABY IN THE BULDOZER!

Nine Inch Nails has always been known for being unique controversial and just plain bizzare. There is no artist out there at this time nor has there ever been that carries this kind of sound. Based on the late 70's-and early 80's New Wave sound and the early years of heavy metal and techno. Trent Reznor put all those sounds together to form what is now one of the biggest underground music movements to date, Industrial/metal you can dance to. Ever since 'Pretty Hate Machine' NIN as always been one of the most anticipated acts in music. This time around Reznor created another triumph with 'Year Zero' Being skeptical because it was the fasted release since Reznor's previous 'With Teeth' I was proven dead wrong. 'Year Zero' is everything NIN has been and more. Never a dull moment no songs to single out. All it is, is the music you always loved from this band. All hail Trent Reznor!

At the very end of the 2nd seasons finale, everyones favorite bad boy of the court room Alan Shore says to his partner in crime Denny Crane. 'Let's hope they pick us up for another season' Why did that even have to be said, because this show is fantastic! The fact of the matter is people are just not watching as much tv as they use to. Today however if they are, they are watching the right shows and Boston Legal happens to be one of them. After numorous nods from the emmys this show bursts onto the small screen better than ever. With a minor cast change unfortunatly letting go of Monica Potter, the cast is just as sharp and witty. With a new full time cast member in Julie Bowen and plenty of appearences from very famous faces, including Michael J. Fox, Tom Seleck and Robert Wagner every episode expands the story of the law firm of Crane Poole & Schmidt and even does justice by wrapping up older stories from the first season. There are very few shows I would recomend to purchase on dvd, but I assure you this is one you will want to watch more than once and I am only sure that eventhough I saw not a single episode of season 3 it will not be a dissapointment.

I have already written a review on the original release of `Watchmen' on DVD. However, for you first time readers I have posted the original review of the movie along with my review of the Ultimate collection.The comic book has now officially become the mainstream in the world of film. The major companies try to get their hands on every franchise they possibly can. The real question is once there is a movie in play how will translate to the big screen and who is the fan base? Well, we all have seen what `The Dark Knight' and `Spider-Man' have done. Still, what about the no so main stream novels such as `300'? There are directors out there that don't want to make a movie in their own vision, but yet they wish to bring the book to the screen word for word, page for page. That is the film 'Watchmen'.'Watchmen' may be the biggest cult fan based comic book of all time. Written in an alternate reality in the 1980s, the Cold War is very much alive and all of Earth is extremely concerned about nuclear war. The heroes in this world are not ones special abilities or powers, and they are not liked by the people. Though, the costumed crusaders prevail to keep the people in line and keep order in the world. Suddenly one of them is brutally murdered and they are now the ones who fear extinction.I made it my business to make sure I read the graphic novel before I went to see this film and it was a wise choice. This movie no doubt tried to remain as faithful to the comic as possible. The dialogue was melancholy, they characters were well cast and while there were not as many effects as a major comic book blockbuster it was still put together in a very artsy package. Though, this movie is truly not for the mainstream movie goers. Watchmen was definitely created with the true comic book fan in mind. The director Zack Snyder like on his previous work with `300' wanted to make a movie that was just as authentic as the pages it was first concocted upon. Those who read this story would definitely enjoy it even though it is a very slow movie dragged out story. There are a few major things that are changed for cinematic purposes, but after reading this story I believe that the changes made really made the story more believable and less confusing. The changing of the costumes was a positive thing because some of those characters really looked like pimped out hood ornaments in print. The actors chosen were not well known which a great thing is always. They each filled their roles perfectly and it really made me feel like the comic book was actually coming to life before my eyes. I believe that if you read the book definitely pick the movie up. If you are an innovative person who wants to see something different then you might enjoy it as well. But, I think if you are looking for the typical action super-hero flick let this one pass you by, you might not understand it. Alan Moore may have officially removed himself from any film that his work was to become, but I believe he needs to see this one, because it really has done him justice. Watchmen came out at the right time because Zack Snyder got it right.Apparently I was not on target when I originally wrote my review, because now we have a 5 DVD Watchmen extravaganza. I have to say for one movie on its' own I have never seen such a package. This edition has everything that was made in honor of this film even dating before the movie itself was officially released in theaters! Before the movie came out where two animated films made for DVD release. The animated creation of `Tales of The Black Freighter', which is an essential piece to the Watchmen story. The special feature on that DVD included `Tales From Under the Hood'. In the graphic novel itself you see excerpts of that book and for DVD it is reinvented to be a television documentary complete with effects that make it look aged and its own advertisements. The other DVD release was `Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic'. This was the graphic novel page for page narrated like a book on tape making the original comic book art look as if it was jumping right off the page. Thanks to this new Ultimate collectors edition these two projects are woven in to the film to make it more true to the novel and really give this film the honor and respect it deserves. Other features include the official video journals and incredible documentaries and commentary not to mention a digital copy of the original theatrical release. How can you possibly pass up purchasing this amazing DVD package? This package has it all...I am serious there is nothing missing from this film now! If you loved this movie you are going to love it even more when you officially have the complete story.

There are so many people bashing this new album from one of the greatest bands of the 90's. The reasons are probably some of the lamest I have ever heard. If you are going to take cheap shots at someone you have to have a way to back it up. First of all, yes, this album only has one of the origional members. A bit of info for you all, Everclear was created by Art Alexakus and he is the true brainchild of the band. He wrote all the songs, produced all the records and even when he created his own solo project had the gumption to call upon Craig Montoya and Greg Aukland to play on the album...that became 'Songs From An American Movie Pt 1." The other two memebers did not break their backs for anything so wheather they are on this new album or not it still has the sound and vibe to what Everclear was all about.The songs on this new album is pretty much an overview of the entire Everclear histoy. Hard angry songs like 'Hated' and soft ballads with the pattonted Everclear harmony like in 'Glorious'. I being a very big fan of Everclear am glad that Art still choses to move forward and bring his music to his fans. In a time when rock music is presumably dead among the popular 'music' it is good to know there are still some trying to keep good old fassioned rock n' roll out there. For all you out there who want to bash this cd you probably listen rap music or someone with no talent anyway.

In the 1990s there were two awesome action cartoons. One was Batman The Animated Series and the other was X-MEN. Both went on to spawn other TV shows around their respected comic universes and while DC until this day still has the upper edge X-MEN still stood the test of time and it has finally come to DVD!The X-MEN show gave us the most popular X-MEN of the time and threw a few guest appearances in every now and again. The stories were loosely based on the stories in the comic and the animation was dead on in regards to the characters themselves. The show was fun, full of action and paid true homage to the X-MEN universe as a whole. One of the major pluses about this show was the animation. I loved how they didn't change the style of the costume on any of the characters, even though some of them who were in fact X-MEN in the comics and not in the show still had the `X' badge on their clothes. I guess it was a message to the fans who never read the comics to go out and read them. Still, unlike Bruce Timms DCAU there were a few imperfections on the Marvel end of the spectrum. One was the fact that it was a little too kiddie. I mean take Wolverine for example...he is a character that is gritty and dark, yet being a kids show there were times that they just made him far too goofy with his jokes. While the voice acting on him was good again it was just far too child oriented. Still, when you are 9 years old it's something that you have no issues with, fast forward through time about 2 decades and there are lines in there that make me cringe. However, within this shows 4 year run there were some very deep episode that really touched on the backgrounds of all the characters. There were in fact a select few that were extremly emotional and that was how some chapters in the X-MEN world have been throughout time. Also while I was never able to catch any future episodes past the Dark Phoenix Saga I read up and saw that a lot of these episodes in the last 3 season were show out of order. The DVD releases could have fixed that but putting them all in the right order, but they didn't. Not that the episodes were bad or anything, but continuity does intend to work. I remember there was an episode that is on the final 5th DVD set which should have been in the beginning of the 3rd set because of the plot.In summation I am very glad that this show is on DVD. I own it and love it. I am very glad that they decided to finally bring one of the best TV shows of my time to DVD so I could finally enjoy it in its entirety.Recommended Episodes:Volume 1: The Unstoppable JuggernautVolume 2: A Rogue's TaleVolume 3: Cold ComfortVolume 4: Beyond Good & Evil 1-4Volume 5: Old Soldiers

It has been such a long time since a creative mind actually found the power to create a story that captured the imagination of the entire world at the perfect moment. Harry Potter the story of boy who finds out he is a big part of a hidden world of magic, spells, and mythical creatures, now must join it only to discover he is being hunted by the one who murdered his family.I was already a huge fan of the books, so when the movie was set to be released in 2001 I was very excited and curious to see how it would turn out. I enjoyed the movie, unlike many who said it was long and sometimes boring. Read the tagline people...'Let The Magic Begin'. Hello we still have 6 more parts to this story! 'Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone' is just like every first installment of a major film saga. Introduce the main characters show us their part and of course just throw a tiny bit of foreshadowing of what is yet to come.This movie is truly enjoyable for anyone who wants to get away from the real world. The characters are great as well as the actors who play them. I was also amazed at how Chris Columbus tried as best as he could to keep this first movie as close to the book as possible. Yes there were some things taken away and a few others changed for the sake of cinema, but for the first part of this grand story when the movie was over the only thought going through my head was... "It can only get better from here."

We have all seen the traditional love story and like the movie narrator said...'this is not one of them'. I have seen a great deal of romantic films, most of them involve a lot of adolescence and 80s new wave music. 500 Days of Summer, however is truly something special.What had me so taken by this movie was how relatable the movie was as a whole. It's the story of an average nice guy, who is smitten by a girl that is somewhat out of a dream to him. He is then taken on a mysterious journey into the mind of a woman who he is unsure of. It is a movie about trusting your instincts and while things are being shown to you in one way you have the ability to see them in a completely different one. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays one of his greatest rolls in this film as Tom. He is the guy that every average guy sees them self as. The guy who looks for the good in everything and does everything right in life to himself and to others and yet in the end gets the crap beaten out of him at the end all because he dared to dream. Zooey Deschanel plays an amazing role as Summer in this film. The girl who could be your girlfriend if you try hard enough and yet, she is the one that no one can read. When these two grade A personalities meet you get one of the greatest adventures you will ever experience in a movie. The originality is also what drives this movie. It takes you all over a relationship but out of order. It is amazing to see the emotions that anyone can feel at various points in time. How they can go from walking on air to wanting to jump off a bridge and all the little junctures in between that got you from point A to B.Even if you have never seen or never enjoyed a romantic comedy in your lifetime, 500 Days of Summer is one you have to see. This is a film with great performances and a story that is driven by powerful emotions, life lessons and of course a killer soundtrack. Why this movie got not a scrap of credit in the 2010 Oscars is beyond me.

Like its basis, we come to the final chapter in the Family Guy Star Wars saga with 'It's A Trap'. The style of story telling and the humor is exactly the same there is really nothing different in this new installment that was expected. I have to call this conclusion one thing...'RESPECTABLE'.As a fan of this parody, you knew there was going to be nothing new. The same old Family Guy characters and jokes and pop culture references galore. The opening of the episode pretty much hit the nail on the head bashing itself about how it was only for the money and the executives made us do it. Some of the jokes like 'SSSDS' were right on target at the right moment and they just got a great belly laugh out of me. In the end i was satisfied and very glad they decided to make the whole trilory.Now I am going to sit back and patiently wait for the prequil trilogy, I mean let's face it they still have plenty of 'American Dad and 'Cleveland Show' characters to use.

In the past decade the traditional blockbuster has split in to three categories. The Comic Book film, The 1980's Cartoon Film and of course the infamous Fantasy Novel Saga. The newest sensation is the modern day vampire love story called `Twilight'.Once again the mythology of the vampire has been picked to be re-invented for a whole new generation to call their own. Twilight definitely has changed the image of the vampire. Suddenly they shine light diamonds in the sunlight and have lost their fangs. Heck in this version we are introduced to the "Vegetarian" vampire. That is a vampire that feeds off the blood of animals as opposed to humans. The story is about of course a human girl that finds out the boy she has a huge crush on is a Vampire. The Vampire is plagued by her beauty knowing he should not kill her, but can he even bare to love her back afraid he would fall into madness.I have heard so many things about this story. Mostly my girls who are madly in love with the Shakespearian like romance between the two main characters, so of course being one of the highest grossing movies of 2008, I was intrigued. After I saw this movie I wanted to hop into the bathtub with a razor blade. I am so sorry, but I thought this movie so depressing and just pitiful. The real name of this movie should have been EMO: The Motion Picture. Everyone in this film was so mopey is made me laugh. I would seriously give Kristen Stewart 1000 bucks if she would show a naturally happy smile. Not to exaggerate, but I actually had to watch this movie a second time just to see if I possibly missed something and maybe my thoughts were just too harsh. Nope, they didn't change. The only thing that kept me going was all the good looking Vampiers (girl bloodsuckers). All the characters looked like they just stepped out of a CW TV teen drama.Yes, I know the saying never judge a book by its movie. But, I truthfully never intended on reading the books anyway. I just expect the movies that I see to be entertaining whether based on novels or not. This was a pathetic excuse of a movie, it would have been better off as a made into a TV drama, the special effects were pretty much up to small screen par. I know there is no way to prevent the final 3 films from being released. Will I see them...sure if I don't have to pay for it and if I am in need of a good laugh over a beer with some buddies. Oh yea, anyone who takes Twilight over Harry Potter...take a Zoloft and make an appointment with your therapist because you got issues.

With the new Green Lantern film heading into theaters soon, Bruce Timm and company felt it would be necessary to give the movie goers a little Green Lantern 101. The DCAU returns with the latest film `Green Lantern: Emerald Knights'.Based around the same concept of `Batman: Gotham Knight', this film features 6 interlocking stories. Five of the six stories are actually told by Hal Jordan & Sinestro to young newcomer Arisia as they prepare to face a foe that has been dormant for centuries. Each story features a different Green Lantern well known and non to show you that at one point they too were young and overwhelmed by what being a Green Lantern is all about. I have to say that this film while it is not the best, it is by far the most fun. I love the lore that is explored through each of the stories from the very first Lantern a creative story about the mysterious and elusive Lantern known as Mogo. Each story is very different from the next from the overly dramatic to the just plain entertaining. The voice cast is fantastic and Green Lantern fans can rejoice everywhere now that Nathan Fillion finally fills the shoes of Hal Jordan. The rest of the cast is fantastic, with each one playing their roles very well. My favorite would have to be Henry Rollins voicing Kilowog who is always a great Green Lantern to watch. Even the great Roddey Piper gets a voice in this movie. While I am a fan of Jason Issacs, and enjoyed his work he has already done in the DCAU, I was a little displeased with him playing Sinestro. I think it is just because I was already use to Sinestro with an American accent and not a Brittish one. Still, that does not mean his job was bad.`Green Lantern: Emerald Knights, is a great prelude to what is yet to come on the big screen. I just hope that the film will be just as fun to watch as this one.On a side note, while I enjoyed this movie I have to lash out. I was furious that it took Warner Bros. so long to announce the release of the Two Disc DVD. I am not a fan of Blu-Ray and I don't intend to invest in them at this point. I unfortunately had to find out that the Two-Disc DVD was only available at Wal-Mart for a limited time. Now, I did get it and I was willing to pay the price, but you gotta keep us fans happy by giving us what we want. If you want to make a change, please give us fair warning. I just hope that Warner Bros, shapes up and goes back to releasing both the One & Two Disc DVDs back on Amazon, especially starting with Batman: Year One.

When I first put down the fifth Harry Potter book I had told my friends that when the movie was made it was going to be amazing. 'Order of The Phoenix' was a real step up in the Harry Potter saga. A story that originated around magic spells and fairytales became a real world of war and politics. Harry Potter knew that this year at Hogwarts was going to be no different than the previous. Witnessing a fellow student die at the hands of his enemies the previous year things have gone from bad to worse. The Wizadering World has been torn between believers of the dark lords' return and those who just want to live in denial. Unfortunatly the second side is the side with all the power as the Ministry is trying to keep everyone in line including the children at Hogwarts. With a new teaching on the grounds insituting new rules to keep Harry's mouth shut, Harry and his friends are not going to take it lightly.This film was going to be a challenge for whomever took the directors chair. Small time director David Yates created a great film rich in the detail of the story. Eventhough a great amount of the books material was cut it was just like 'Goblet of Fire' There is a lot of pointless side story which really has no reference to the meat of the story and that is why you do not see those in the film. The characters have really come a long way acting wise. The children have really evolved since the begining and new commer Imelda Staunton nailed Umbridge. What David Yates did that was very different from the previous directors was that he made these characters real. With all the wizardry and magic there was a real sense of realisim through the diologue and the emotions expressed by the characters. Now with Yates signed on for the final 2 installments (3 technically due to the divison of Deathly Hallows) I am even more excited to see how the rest of this story emerges on to the big screen.

And the review continues...so the hero has been chosen and it is time for Anakin to begin his legendary adventure in that galaxy far far away. It has been 10 years since he was found by the now deceased Qui-Gon Gin and began his Jedi training under Obi-Wan Kenobi. Just when things were going well who just happens to show up. Padme Amidalla the now Senator for her home planet Naboo...and the wackiness ensues!!! `Attack of the Clones' is a step up above `The Phantom Menace' as all second chapters are in the great stories. The characters have been introduced and now its time to give them a problem. Unfortunately this episode is another disappointment to the obsessed fans of this story because what is featured is the love story between Anakin and Padme the to be parents of Luke and Leia, but don't count this one out so quickly my friends there some great things to be seen.In this movie I loved that we got to see Courosant in its grandeur after being one of the biggest teases Mr. Lucas gave his fans with the special edition of `Return Of The Jedi' I loved the night clubs, the traffic and even the dinner...I felt very proud to be a New Yorker watching that. We also get to see how the system of Jedi training works and now we understand that Yoda really did instruct Obi-Wan because he trains every single Jedi. I also loved how we finally get to see the origin of the most mysterious character in the story to date...of course I'm talking about Boba Fett and I was amazed how his role in the story was much more complex than many had thought. There are also a few other pieces that are revealed which of course we all left hanging in the air just waiting for the next 3 years to pass for the space to be filled with Episode 3.Altogether the movie is enjoyable unless you spent all your life living in your parents' basement and downloading scripts trying to spend hours upon hours memorizing every single level of the death star. It still however lacked that one little piece which we all had to wait another 3 years to see. Not even the great signature BMF lines from Sam Jackson, or Yoda's surprising fight scene at the end couldn't keep me satiated. Otherwise...the force was still with Mr. Lucas at that point in time and once again another fun film put in the books.

The biggest fad in movie making now along with the comic book films is 1980's cartoon shows. With so much success from Transformers and TMNT and with GI Joe on the way we almost forget about the light hearted fun cartoons. Alvin & The Chipmunks have been aroud before the 1980s, but the cartoon was a classic and I loved it to death. So, of course I am going to see the movie.There was a lot of pesimistic thoughts towards it and the movie was not the best plot wise. Still a movie doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyed by many. This movie was so adorable and fun to watch. The cartoon definitely had a huge basis around the character development and the songs played on the history of their singing career.Say what you will, but this movie was fun. If you look hard enough there are even some lessons to be told about youth in the music industry. These past few years have showed us the hardships of some young talents and how they can be troubled by fame and the media spotlight. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by any age and now that I found out that the Chipettes will be playing a major role in the 'Squeakuel' I am ready to throw down another ten bucks and be there front row center. THE CHIPMUNKS ROCK!

In film DC Comics only brought us one too many versions of Superman & Batman. While a few other comic characters from this company have made it to film like `Watchmen' & `Hellblazer' Still, where are all the other popular DC characters? Our prayers were finally answered this summer with `Green Lantern'First off, I am a huge Green Lantern fan. I love the story and I love the fact that a hero so simple can have such a deep complex life as well as a very deep story. This movie was huge, because the entire DC franchise was weighing it. Success would bring all the other major DC names to the big screen finally. Unfortunately, this film is not the greatest. The acting was not the greatest, but thank goodness Ryan Reynolds was able to do a decent job. Blake was not lively at all as Carol Ferris and Marc Strong who played Sinestro barley got any screen time. The other weakness of the film while it was strength to me was the story. The story of Green Lantern goes far beyond the ring, there is a whole world full of Green Lanterns that protect the entire universe and a story like that may not sit well with people whom have never read the comic and no nothing of the lore. Green Lantern fans will appreciate that aspect, but at the same time will not be entirely satisfied due to the subpar acting.There is a great deal of potential for a sequel to be a better film, especially with the cliffhanger ending. The only problem is due to box office failure, there may not be another film. Still, `Green Lantern' is a fun film and I own it and after seeing it a second I still feel the same way. It is a fun film that the true fan will enjoy, with of potential to be better.Again this is a horrible DVD and I blame it on Blu Ray, there are next to know decent special features and you can only get the extended edition on Blu Ray...shame shame.

I was very excited to get back into Heroes post writers strike. When the whole advertising campaign is about the coming of villains anyone would be excited. When season 3 began it was without a doubt cool to see a more realistic view of classic comic book villainy in a real world setting. Yet as the season moves on the new villains are quickly picked off and we are pretty much stuck with the same cast of characters trying to figure out what side they are on. Another plus on this season is the character development of Sylar and how he tries to truly figure out where he comes from and why he has the power to kill. Unfortunately the plot is just way too confusing especially when Nathan decides to start hunting all the Specials down and put them in detainment camps. Though the ending is pretty cool as the main characters dive into a very mysterious part of their past and figure out how this whole story began. Even after that there are still many more questions to be answered.Personally I think a show like Heroes is great, but at this point I am wondering what season 4 is going to bring because this show is really starting to go downhill.

So many ladies, so little time. That's the top subject in the world of `Ranma '. The third season comes in full swing giving Ranma more to worry about than just trying to survive a day with out ticking off Akane. Just when he thought things were settling down an old friend makes her return. Her name is Ukyo, another tomboy but cuter and she makes a pretty tasty Japanese pizza. Oh and she also happens to be Ranma's fianc&eacute;. Now Ranma has to ward off four girls and a guy (don't worry he only goes after him in girl form) just to get some time to him self.But now something is wrong. Apparently Ryoga is in love with Akane and just can't seem to muster the courage to take her away from Ranma, why Ranma...are you jealous?Mousse is still on Ranma's trail and will stop at nothing to win the heart of Shampoo even if it means teaming up with Ryoga, Tatewake Kuno and even Ranma...(yes you read it right) to do so. And watch out for Shampoo's little sisters Ranma, Amazonians are a force to be reckoned with no matter how young. Suit up and come hungry for an exciting new season as the whole gang takes on the mysteries of the paranormal. Ghosts of the past and present haunt the ally-ways of Japan and inner demons lash out to take control of their own. Dive into history of Happosai and Shampoo's great grandmother Cologne and the strange love story that happened long ago. Hey they may even make a quick stop at Jusenkiyo while they're at it! Even the peon servant of the Kuno kids, Sezuke will have his moment in the sun in this season. Friendships will grow, hearts will be broken and food of all kinds will be eaten by the boatloads. As a whole, it's a season full of enjoyable memories.*Recommended Episode: Les Miserables of the Kuno Estate*

Cell is ready to get down and dirty with Goku and the Z fighters in the Sixth season of Dragon Ball Z. This is pretty much what we have been looking forward to since Trunks gave Goku the warning and now after two whole seasons of warm-ups it is time for the full on fight to the death. Not since the Frieza Saga have we seen such an incredible battle. Though this one will have a few interesting twists to it as well as new characters with will either amaze or disgust you. Sit back and enjoy all the glory that is Dragon Ball Z!

There is really nothing new to say about the second season of Robot Chicken. The same 10 minute episodes of nothing but bashing pop culture by using the most unappreicated people in show business with all the vulgarity and disturbing images this show has to offer from brain child Seth Green. Who could ask for anything more?! Wait....uncensored you say?....I'LL TAKE IT! What seals the deal in this compliation of episodes is the infamous Star Wars: Phone Call. You will wet your pants from laughing so hard and then you will wet your pants a second time because like the fool you are you just had to watch it again instantaniously. You have been warned.

After 7 years we return back to the days of Captain Jack Sparrow and the swashbuckling mayhem of Pirates of the Caribbean. Under new leadership of Rob Marshal and replacing Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly (For now) with Ian McShane & Penelope Cruz it makes for another action packed, laugh filled Pirates adventure.Simply put, if you have seen the first 3 and you liked the first 3, then 'On Stranger Tides' will be movie you will like as well. I was glad that they went back to the first film and realized that a simple easy to follow story is better than something overly complicated. Having Johnny Depp & Geoffrey Rush do what they do best as Jack and Barbosa, it's a winner. Still, the fact that it is just another 'Pirates of the Caribbean', well it may not always be a good thing.So apparently there will be a possible Pirates 5 & 6 as a "New Trilogy" I am wondering where the next adventure will be.

After an ending like the one seen in 'Dead Man's Chest' whp wasn't excited to see this final instalment? In 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' We are taken into the relms of the bizzare, haunting and exciting. The crew of the Black Pearl now lead by the resurected Captain Barbosa has two missons. To find our hot star Johnny Depp and to bring this fantastic story to a close.'At World's End' gave us exactly what were were looking for, by tying up all the loose ends of the story with all the characters, but also broadening the horizons of the pirate world. We now see the uniting of the 8 Pirate lords and strangley enough Jack Sparrow is one of them. The pirates go into an all out battle at sea against the East India Company and Davy Jones in a fight to the finish that only Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski can do.At the end you will be left a bit confused wondering where the story will go from here and the same time happy with how this story ended. This unforgettable franchise now sails proudly into the sunset officially completing its goal going down as one of the greatest trilogies.

The 80's gave birth to the most unique genre of music in history. The enigma that was New Wave was appreciated but all music fans. From the pop charts, to the underground it was music with depth, fun and a very catchy sound you could dance to or blast in your car. Yet, one band stands out on top and that is the band New Order.New Order may not have been the most well known in music. Yet if you heard the well known songs Blue Monday and Bizzare Love Triangle you enjoyed them even though you didn't know who sang them. I have to say listening to this band in retrospect, never have I heard more deep, heartfelt song writting. I mean I don't want to knock a band like the Beatles but New Order surley beats them in the song writting catagory. These songs when listened to can bring your heart to skip a beat or even a tear to your eyes. If you listen to the song 1963 you will surley understand what I am getting at.New Order is a band that must not be over looked. If you look at the bands beginings with Joy Division these are people that really had alot of stories to tell and emotions to bring their music to life. Give a listen you will probably be as surprised as I was.

As someone who has been a fan of this band since first hearing Shimmer on the radio, I have to say I am glad that this band was able to stick it out. After losing two founding members of the band and the refusal of Chris Daughtry to fill Brett Scallions shoes I was wondering if Fuel would burn out.(no pun intented)But the true fans know that Fuel is the brain child of guitarist Carl Bell, and still as one of the most underratted song writters in the alternative rock scene I could tell that he was one that would not want to have Fuel go under. So with a new Drummer and leadsinger Fuel has been re-encartanted and sounds very similar to the previous 3 albums. If you are a fan you will not be disappointed by any of the tracks. The same hard energetic sounds and the melodic ballads remain as passionate as ever, not as belty as Bretts vocals but a little more suttle which is a good thing. After all, no one likes a whinner. After time passes on Angels & Devils it would be great to see a band like Fuel rise up into the mainstreem of rock and allow this re-invented foursome to make some new music in the coming years.

What would you say if your best friend whom you have trusted for the longest of time was discovered to have known all your deepest and darkest secrets? If that day ever came, he or she would use them against you to take you down. Enter the newest DCAU film `Justice League: Doom.A secret society of super villains led by one of the most mysterious of them all finally has discovered how to bring the Justice League to an end, by turning them against each other. It turned out that one of them (you can probably figure out who) had files on each and every one of them, just in case. By using those secrets each of them is exposed and their vulnerabilities tear them up from within. Eventually as always evil is punished, but at what price?This film is one of the better in the ever growing DCAU library. Unlike `New Frontier `& `Crisis On Two Earths', `Doom' individualizes each of these super-heroes and shows a very human side to them. There are moments in this film that make you feel a bit uncomfortable as you watch each of them fight their inner demons. Of course, the action is great and when you see the easily predictable final good vs. evil showdown, it's hard to disappoint. The film also ends on a very different note, more of a melancholy ending which is also something I have not seen in these films thus far. Finally, the voice acting, it was great to see the original cast back in action. Bringing back Nathan Fillion to voice Hal Jordan is always a treat. It was a bit weird to see Michael Rosenbaum giving his voice to the Barry Allen Flash and not the wise cracking Wally West. It shows how much these guys have grown together as a collective group.As I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I am always excited for the next DCAU film. The two disc edition includes a very heartfelt and in-depth look into the legacy of Dwayne McDuffie. It is definitely worth the extra money.

The X-MEN films are a very important piece of the whole comic book film phenomenon of the past 10 years. Unfortunately after X2, the X-MEN films themselves were only sub-par. I was a little concerned with this prequel/reboot, but I have to admit I got quite a surprise.`X-MEN: First Class', while it is not a accurate origin story compared to the comic books, it is a well done origin story of the X-MEN film universe. What made this film work so well was the time that was put into the characters. You actually get connected with them especially Mystique & Magneto. What made these characters so believable was the actors and they were all great. James MacEvoy, Michael Fastbender, Jennifer Lawrence, hell even Kevin Bacon was great. If Kevin Bacon is in a movie these days, there has to be something right with it.If you have enjoyed the X-MEN films in the past, then definitely give this one a try. It does have a few weak points, but it is a fun film none the less.

Quinten Tarantino has a love hate relationship with the movie going public. He is one of the few major faces in film who wants to make movies his way whether you love them or hate them. His stories are jumbled his humor is crude and to a great deal of dislike he loves to push the bar. In the end he manages to put together a brilliant ensemble cast and always finds ways to take some of the famous names in acting and put them in a role and is out of their element. The outcome just gives fan goose bumps especially with the newest edition to his library.Inglorious Basterds was a movie I was very eager to see. As a Tarantino fan and lover of every film he has directed I was very excited to see a movie about Jewish soldier beating up Nazis. As a member of the Jewish faith and a grandchild of Holocaust survivors there was no doubt in my mind that this was a film that was going to spark tremendous amounts of controversy. Yes, the story told is entirely false and the major Jewish press felt that his work was a shear mockery, but Tarantino stated he had no intentions of making a Holocaust documentary. As a fan of films that involve larger than life heroics, he wanted to give every little Jewish boy and girl a dose of ...dare I say it...Pulp Fiction. These types of stories go back to the days of Superman and Captain America comic books taking down the Nazis and it was done with style and class and Tarantino in my eyes at least didn't push any harsh buttons with me. The acting in this film is awesome, he cast the right people for the right roles especially Christoph Waltz as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. His performance was the best I have seen all year and he really put fear into the movie watchers. I am so happy he was nominated for the golden globe and I sure hope he gets the Oscar nod and wins it. Brad Pitt, I have not seen in a more brilliant role since the stoner in `True Romance'. You also have great performances from Diane Kruger, and yes even Mike Myers! As a Tarantino fan, you get everything you need from Inglorious Basterds. Listen very carefully to some of the voices you hear throughout the film you may get a few awesome surprises.If you haven't seen this movie yet, Jewish or not it is a must see. It is a pure rush of excitement and that is why we go to the movies.

After seeing a film such as 'Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind' I was very curious to see the rest of Studio Ghibli's work. The next film in their collection is 'Castle In The Sky'. Pazu is a young hard working orphan with big dreams. While he enjoys working as an apparentice for a stern but caring Miner he dreams of fulfilling the goals of his late father. To uncover the mythical ciy of Laputa that floats way above the clouds. One night he catches a young girl that falls from the sky with a mysterious glowing blue stone around her neck. Suddenly Pazu is carried away in an unforgettable chase from government spies and hysterical air pirates only to help this mysterious girl named Sheeta. What Pazu is soon to find out is that Sheeta carries a huge secret that's got them both on the run, the possible way to Laputa. Now the young children must trust in one another and understand the power of the crystal to unlock the secrets it holds so they can keep it away from the wrong hands.Hayao Miyazaki's second film such an amazing one. It is filled with drama, comedy and unforgettable characters. The chemistry between the characters is very real in a story that is so fantastic and inventive you just can't help but wonder what will happen. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great story that will unlock the deepest parts of your imagination.

Certain things in this world will never die, but sometimes they will take a long nap until they come back into the limelight. This time it is that wonderful one of a kind cast of characters that are The Muppets.The Muppets are just truly special and while the last few movies may not have been the greatest whenever the Muppets come back to the big screen you better know I am gonna be there. `The Muppets' is a very different Muppet movie because it is really a tribute to them from the fans that missed them and just plain adore them. Jason Siegel wanted to bring them back for a whole new generation to enjoy and while the movie is great there is just a little something missing. Still, it's not that what is missing can be found because it is the voices of the characters, but unfortunately the original cast is just getting to that point where they can't work at it anymore. Still, it is a film that wants to preserve the magic that Jim Henson created over 50 years ago and as a movie on its own it is a great movie. The soundtrack is not the greatest, but the more you listen to it the more you learn to like it. I feel that this Muppet movie is going to start something big for the next few years more films and even a new TV show is in the works.We just can't have a world without these great characters and this time around the movie itself shows us just how great The Muppets truly are. If you are a Muppets fan you are going to love all the classic stuff thrown into the new film as well as all the guest starts and blend a few new things into the mix you have yourself a true and fun Muppet movie.

I finally was able to see this third installment of one of my most beloved childhood characters and after what I thought were two fun and enjoyable films and I excited to see the new one. At this point I was expected no more character introductions and just a great Chipmunk story. Unfortunately I was not to happy with what I got.'Chipwrekced', was nothing but a simple no effort film that ties up all the lose ends that the predecessors left behind. Also, it was an attempt to place stupid pop culture references all through-out the movie. Of course I will admit there were some very cute moments and jokes. Even more so a little bit of character development, but a very small amount. The music of course is always a Chipmunk staple, but it this film the flow of the songs was just very unorganized and a little over done.At this point I think it is safe to say that this franchise is history, it was nice to have a brief moment of Chipmunk-Mania, especially since these characters have been in the public eye since the late 1950's. Still, if you want to have a proper send off, you gotta give it some effort. Will there be a 4th film...if there is I would not be shocked, even if it was just a made for video release. Will I see it...unless they fix what they broke, definitely not...I'm munked out for now.

Work has its ups and downs, but there are those that just don't want to get up in the morning because they just hate their boss. Now, imagine if you will where you have officially had enough to the point where you want to kill your boss. That is the story of `Horrible Bosses'.`Horrible Bosses' is a simple to follow story with lots of laughs and it really isn't the most original comedy out there. However, what makes this film so great is the amazing ensemble cast that is in this film. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day & Jason Sudekas are brilliant together and give us one great laugh after another. Then you have the bosses played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston & Collin Ferral. What did it for me was Jennifer Aniston whom I am not a fan of, but to see her playing the outrageous role of the nymphomaniac dentist was some of the most impressive acting I have ever seen from her.While this movie is very funny, it is far from perfect. The story was not as great as `Bridesmaids' and Jennifer Aniston & Collin Ferral were very underused. I would have loved to see the two of them more in the movie because I loved what I saw in the parts they were in throughout the film. Still, you will get your laughs from this one and it was one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time and believe me where comedy is heading these days it's a real challenge to find a good one.FYI, I hate blu ray even more because they don't even put the unrated edition on DVD that's terrible.

Holy free hollies! The DVD of the century is finally here! We all know that Steven Speilberg can do almost anything. He gave birth to the summer blockbuster, turned Harrison Ford into a film icon and created one of the most horrifying yet respectable movies (Schindler's List.) Where could he go from here? He started a cartoon empire. In the early 1990's a whole group of Spielberg cartoons busted onto the TV and gave us plenty to laugh about, but also learn about. Animaniacs is probably the most brilliant cartoon ever to be created...EVER!Animanics is about 3 whatchimawhozits named Yakko Wakko and Dot. They were locked away in the 30's for being out of control and now they have escaped! Since they escaped they have made fun of pop culture in every way possible but also gave us a huge amount of knowledge through word and song. Consider it Sesame street for older kids and adults. The songs like Yakkos World, The Senses Song and many others are what really made this tv show stand out and show the world that cartoons don't always have to be just plain silly or action packed where the good guy wins every time. This DVD set is a must have in your collection. If you are a die hard fan of the show or never saw it in your life, it is still a must have. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed and if you are I expect to hear from you!

So it comes to this the end of a short-lived masterpiece. Well Mr. Vasquez surly saved the best for last. This final volume of Invader Zim is by far the zaniest and most brilliant out of the entire series. This piece really fills up all the gaps in the Invader Zim story line. We are introduced to the vile Irken female invader named Tak. I am sure that Dib would have killed himself knowing he tried to get with an alien. The head of planet food courtia also tracks down Zim. And of course...I mean...nothing is more ingenious than an episode dedicated to Zim eating waffles! Nothing happens in that episode yet you just can't help but laugh at him just eating waffles! I heard that there were other episodes that were written, but never released. The true question is...what are the chances of a possible Invader Zim comeback? Knowing television programming these days probably slim to none. Zim however will remain in the hearts of all the fans along with all the memorable lines and characters that joined him on his quest to conquer Earth. Unfortunately for Zim...he will never find out if he ever did...but speaking as one of his true fans he sure as hell did. Johan Vasquez...thank you.

The newest edition to the Ghibli library is a winner. After a few so-so films and a few disatsers I am glad we finally get a new one with that magical feeling as some of the classics that this studio has given us.'The Secret World of Arriety' is not an origonal story, rather based on one of the most beloved childrens tales 'The Borrowers'. It is a magical tale of wonder, but at the same time a true tale of life, coming of age and survival. The cast of characters is such a great ensamble and the voices chosen for the American version were great. The two that stood out the most were amy Pohler and Carrol Burnett. It was just an easy to follow heart warming story, eventhough there were some moments that were a bit hard to handle it was an all around great film.I was upset that I didn't get to see this film in theaters, and still have yet to see a Studio Ghibli film on the big screen. I am always looking forward to the next Ghibli project, I just hope that the next one is just as enjoyable as this one.

We get a full 180 from 'All Star Superman' to this brand new in your face, brash actionfest. The DCAUs 14th film Superman vs. The Elite is true to its' title. Suddenly a new group of extreme super-heros decide to crash Big Blue's party and halp him save the day. Unfortunatly the way they do things are not something that Superman thinks is ok.This film is yet another great delving into the many faces of Superman, this film captures the mockery of Superman about him being the boy scout and the super-hero that the modern day doesn't need anymore, because he doesn't finish the job. We live in a world today where people are alive that are crazy enough to push a button that can wipe out an entire people's existance. While it is never the right way to fight violence with violence, do we now live in a world where it may the right solution? Superman is really put to the test for his character and his morals and in this film we see just how far he would be willing to go before he gets pushed off the edge. The other question is, if the greatest hero of a generation did in-fact go off the edge...what happens next?Again another enjoyable film with a great story voice cast and plenty of action. The animation is something that makes you a bit uncomfortable at first, but as the film goes on it ends up being the least of the films' problems. The next film will in fact be one that will stand a true test, being taken from debatibly the greatest comic book story ever told. I have a feeling knowing how things have been up until this point in the DCAU it's all good.

So let's pick up where we left off. Ranma is a guy that turns into a girl whenever he gets wet and when he's doused with hot water he becomes a guy again. He is engaged to Akane a girl who hates him just as much as he hates her. Ryoga, his old school rival has tracked him down to kill him, but turns into Akane's pet piglet P-Chan when he gets wet. The Amazon princess Shampoo is in love with the boy Ranma, but wants to kill the girl Ranma. Tatewake Kuno (The school hot shot) has a mad crush on Akane and the girl Ranma, but wants to kill the boy Ranma because he's engaged to Akane and at the same time his kid sister Kodaji is sickly in love with the boy Ranma....whoa when does the madness stop???!!!The second season of `Ranma ' keeps the story moving along in all its wacky glory. It's a season of hysterical competitions, wacky races for glory and searches for cures of the cursed springs that for some reason is turning all these characters into something else. Now the engagement of Ranma and Akane is really taking a toll as we are introduced to the 3000 year old queen of the Amazons who wants to make sure that her great granddaughter gets the man she must marry and believe me it will take a lot of patience and quick wit for Ranma to match up to this tough cookie. It sure doesn't end here as Shampoo's stalker the Kuno kids faithfull servant and yes even Ranma's dad's old master find his way into Ranma's world, panty raids `n all. At this rate there will be no peace for a while at the Tendo house.Sit back and get ready for a monumental season as Ranma is put to the test to find his inner strength and maybe even find the courage to show Akane his true feelings for her.*Recommended Episode: You Really DO Hate Cats!*

First and foremost if you are actually reading this and you haven't seen it, get up off your ass and go to the theater right now! I know it is still playing in a theater somewhere!It has been 11 years since we have seen these characters and I will say when I heard about a script in the works for the third chapter I was a bit skeptical for many reasons. Apparently this movie started out as a direct to DVD release when first conceptualized about...4/5 years ago. It was not going to be in CGI and the plot was about Woody and the gang rescuing Buzz from Japan after he and other first edition Buzz Lightyear figures were recalled to the manufacture. Yea, that could have worked, but this is Toy Story! I mean when we all went to see this movie about 15 years ago we were just awestruck by these unbelievable characters. The movie was full of such magic and the story was so original that is just made you think about your own Toys and how great they felt when you played with them. I know I am going on and on, but that just shows you how meaningful Toy Story is to me and film as a whole.Toy Story 3, does not meet up to the grandeur of its predecessors. Toy Story 3 goes above and beyond anything that this story has given us so far. Toy Story 3 turns this simple little world into a massive epic, and the story itself while it may be so simple and easy to follow, there are just so many different emotional levels seen throughout. There are points in the movie where you will laugh so hard and then in the following scene you will be trying so hard to hold back tears. In the theater I was in, I saw grown men cry. For that to happen because of a movie, it just shows you there is something truly special here. The Pixar animation has come so far since Toy Story, that the textures and scenery that you see in this installment are so believable and lifelike you can almost touch them yourself. The voice acting is fantastic as well. Along with the story, the cast returns and steps up their game as well. Each character is given so much more depth and the funnier members of the bunch get even funnier. On top of that we are introduced a whole new batch of toys. Each one is unique in its own way and the new actors that lent their voices did a wonderful job, it was as almost as if there were there from the start. There are not many jokes that play on satire or pop culture like Shrek, but the humor that is used just works. The movie is great for all ages, but I believe it was really made for those that have been there from the beginning. You can tell by some of the scenes that it is not only because you have known these characters growing up, but it is the fact that you are now seeing these characters as a grown up and how you must have felt when you realized it was time to stop playing with your own toys and if they were like these characters what they must be feeling. On that note, probably the best part of this film would have to be the ending. I don't think I have seen a story end on such a high note since 'Return of the King' It just makes you feel so many different kinds of wonderful emotions. The feelings that you leave with towards these characters, in fact the entire legacy that Toy Story has become, you could not have asked for a more proper send off.Now, after reading this I sure hope that if you haven't seen Toy Story 3 that you will. Brush up on your Toy Story and Toy Story 2, because when you see Toy Story 3 you will be very glad you did. Pixar really has outdone them selves with this film. As a person who has seen almost every Disney animated film and who owns every Pixar film, Toy Story 3 could arguably be the greatest Disney animated film ever made! This movie has been praised by fans and critics everywhere since its theatrical release. It makes me wonder where the Pixar gang will go with future projects, some of which will be sequels to other Pixar classics. In fact I don't think 2010 can possibly give us anything better in film! I have already seen Inception and I have to say that Toy Story just adds that little bit of extra magic. Toy Story 3 to me at this point is the best film of 2010, it has surpassed The Incredibles as my all time favorite Pixar film. I sure hope that this film wins the Oscar for Best Picture of the year, yea I am going to stick to that last statment because a film like Toy Story 3 is why we go to see movies and purchase them in the first place. Not only do we want to be entertained, or just escape the hardships of every day life, in the end what we truly want from the films is that sense of perfection that goes deep within our souls. While that feeling maybe different for everyone if you find that feeling it just sets everything right in the world. Like Peter Jackson, John Lassater deserves his credit that has been due to him ever since he created Toy Story. To get an award as prestigious as the Oscar for best film will show the world that animation can be just as real as live action and if you just have the desire and the passion to create something special that is not depicted by something that is entirely real, you can sure as hell do the best that you can to make it real.BUY THIS MOVIE!!!

If you are interested in your tradition crime solving edge of your seat police movie, have we got a treat for you! 'Hot Fuzz' is the newest release from the comedy team that brought you 'Shawn of the Dead' one of the most origional plays on the cliche horror movie. This time the world of action packed crime fighting cops is placed in the hand of these comic geniuses. There are so many things in this movie that made it probably one of the most entertaining movies I have seen since '300'. One I just love British movies. Two all the hysterical dialogue even during the most tense moments in the movie that just make you snicker even though you know you shouldn't be. Three, the final chapter in the movie that takes almost every cliche moment from your tradition action movie and twists them in so many ways you will wet your pants from laughing so hard. If you haven't been to the movies in a while this will be your final excuse to go before Spider-Man 3 and the other much awaited Summer blockbusters move into theaters

As Goku steps into the ring at the World Martial Arts Tournament against Tien Shinhan, little does he know that his world is about to get even bigger. As he dukes it out with Tien there is a dark cloud looming over the world, darker than Goku can even begin to fathom. That dark cloud is in the form of a ruthless tyrant named King Piccolo. Piccolo is the strongest being on the planet and even with the discovery of the Dragon Balls, his goal is not world domination. Rather, his goal is to destroy every human being on the planet. Now with Tien and Chiatzou as strong allies with some new friends by his side, Goku is about to face Piccolo head on. The only thing here is Goku is not going into this fight with the mindset of saving world alone. This time it is something much, much more.While I was enjoying watching Dragon Ball, this is the point of the Dragon Ball story line that was truly looking forward to the most. The show has so many positives when it reaches this point. One of the big positives is the mood of the show and how quickly it shifts from light hearted and funny, to dramatic and dark. Granted, there are still funny moments especially seen through the pudgy mountain man Yajerobe, but still when Piccolo makes his appearance even Master Roshi, gets serious. The dramatic elements are used so well and I had not seen so much emotion in the characters since season eight of Dragon Ball Z. It all stems from that one moment at the end of the Tien Shinhan saga that sets the pace for the rest of the 4th season. I don't want to give it away, but if you are a DBZ fan this point in time is actually mentioned in the Vegeta saga by Goku and it was a moment that I was really looking forward to seeing.Now there is one more season of Dragon Ball to explore, and I am looking forward to seeing Goku finally making the change from Boy to Man and paving the way for the adventures that will follow in Dragon Ball Z.

Fantasy is probably the best type of story telling out of all the work that has been put on pages and movie screens. With cinema reaching its peek with technology and special effects finally the greatest of the classic fantasy tales can be told. Flying off the coattails of probably the greatest epic ever created: J.R.R. Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings', comes his true life friend C.S. Lewis's Epic: `The Chronicles of Narnia'.The Chronicles of Narnia is 7 stories of a fantasy world that has been under the ruling of Jada the White Witch who was told of a prophecy. Four Human Children would find their way to Narnia and when they did they would allow the true ruler of the world to rise and they would rule along side him as royalty. The first movie `The Lion the Witch & the Wardrobe' is actually the 2nd chapter of the Chronicles and in this story the prophecy is fulfilled. The Pevinse siblings who were sent to the country side of London during WWII stumble upon the world of Narnia through an old wardrobe in their foster home. Then their journey beings as they encounter talking animals, incredible dangers and fantastic magic at every turn. Then the true adventures of Narnia begin.Unfortunately for me I had to miss this movie in the theaters. Being a true fan of the epics like `LOTR', `Harry Potter', `Star Wars' etc, I was eager to pick up the DVD. Unfortunately, people were giving this movie a bad rap. One reason was because it was from Disney, two people were talking about the large amounts of Christian overtones and of course people thought it would be extremely childish and toned down. For once in your lives people, try to forget all of that and just pretend it's an actual movie? I don't think that the people who put this movie together would have wanted to ruin the true story at all. The movie was very well done, it was not the best movie I had ever seen, but it was fun it was exciting and it was not Disneyfied at all. If you are into fantasy and happen to have actually read the book then I am sure you will not be disappointed. If you think about it, no one really was. Because with all the bad rap, Narnia remained in the theaters in the top 10 movies for 4 months and `The Prince Caspian' is set for December 2007 release.

Nothing excites a music fan like a cover song. If you plan on making one of those you have to do one of two things. Either make it your own or very close to the origional with that little twist that lets the fans know who the cover artist is. Now a cover album...there lies a real challenge. Out of possibly 50 or more cover albums to be released in close to the past 5 years the boys from 80's glam metal band Poison step out from the shadows and make one hell of a cd!Poison is one of the few bands from the glam metal scene of the late 1980's when bands like them were coming out by the boat loads. Through all the forgetable names Poison is always one of the first three glam bands people always remember. This new album is what Poison always stood for loud guitars, monster ballads and of course one hell of a good time.I love this cd it has everything a rock fan can ever want. Each track is a classic cover of famous rock songs written by the biggest of the big, like The Rolling Stones, David Bowie and KISS. Poison takes all these songs and pumps them up ten fold using their own classic Poison style. The track that everyone will love it "What I Like About You". Just pure fun the listen to with a guitar intro that punches you right in the face and makes you wake and bang your head. The other great tracks include, Rock N' Roll All Nite, Can't U See, I Need to Know and Your Mama Don't Dance. It is great to see a band like Poison back on the music scene with their fans still with them after all this time and all the cheap shots that chapter in Heavy Metal took. I will say I am glad Poison chose to make this CD because there is no doubt a band like Van Halen or Guns N' Roses would have capitalized on this concept. Better a band that still has some shread of a decent reputation left than a true has been.

The chase is on for the Dragon Balls of the planet Namek, but this time there is more to worry about than just Vegeta. It seems there is a much more powerful being out there with alot of skeletons in his closet. Enter the all powerful Tyrant Frieza, he has stolen Vegeta's idea for immortality and with a whole army of bloodthirsty killers. It's up to the cunning of Bulma, Krillin and Gohan to try and stop them all in time before either evil power gets all the Dragon Balls and of course before Goku gets to Namek to help them.This re-issued dvd has put together two sagas wisley for the second season. As a real Dragon Ball Z fan knows there are long sagas and short sagas. There is no reason to put all the sagas in seperate boxes so why not put a few together just to get 6 disc sets out to the public. I am sure season 4 will be comprised of possibly three sagas altogether. Once again the re-mastering is great the picture is clear the sound is great and now that it's all uncut there is so much more to see and it all flows well. The only reason I gave this dvd only 3 stars is just because the saga its self is very boring. There is really not much that goes on but a big chase for the dragon balls and a little bit of character development. On a lighter note there is one thing that made me so happy to see when the Captain Ginyu Saga began they did not touch the Bruce Falconer soundtrack they re-mastered and enhanced it to make it sound so much better than origional released. You gotta give Funimation credit, they know how to please their fans.

And so the second year begins at Hogwarts school of witchcraft & wizardry. As does the second cinema adaptation of the world of Harry Potter. This piece in the saga starts off right on a good note when Harry is visited by a mysterious elf named Dobby, who warns him that terrible things are going to happen at Hogwarts this year and that Harry must stay away. Unwilling to listen Harry finds out with his good friends Ron & Hermione that long ago one of the founders of the school created a secret chamber where a hidden chapter of the school's history has lay dormant for 50 years. Now there are bloodstained messages on the school walls and non-magical born students are ending up in comas, but worse all fingers are pointing at Harry Potter. Now Harry must question and dive into a world that has been locked away only to bring the secrets of the hidden chamber out in the open.This movie as well as the book is by far my favorite in the saga. This movie really shows significant character development and true bonds of friendship through Harry and his companions. Chris Columbus did a fantastic job for his final directorial attempt, still keeping close to the original story, but also really working with the kids bringing their acting abilities up to speed with the aging characters to make the audience connect with the characters as they did in the book.While the movie is better than its predecessor, it still does rank as the best in the saga for there is still much to learn and 5 more years left to go.

First of all I had no idea that this CD was even in the works, but with the direction music is heading you don't really hear about the 'talented acts'. Hoobastank is one of the few bands that I followed that came out after 2000 and I have to admit that this album is very different from their previous, and different from the modern day typical rock record.'Every Man For Himself' blends some classic Hoobastank along with a fresh new sound, but most importantly the message that they are trying to get accorss to the listeners is quite uncommon. These songs scream to the fans that you are the future of this world and with what's going on in the political world today someone has to take a stand by straying away from the boy loves girl, heartbreaker, screw the establishment songs and let kids know that we have the power to make this world a better place because we are going to be the role models and decisson makers before we know it. The songs are upbeat and bursting with possitivity and leave you question your future and realizing we can't stay young forever.This is a great listen and its a perfect time to have this record released. With other famous rock groups such as Pearl Jam, Tool and The Red Hot Chili Peppers releasing their new work...Hoobastank pulls away with a totaly differnet concept that will definitely be taken to heart.

Sitcoms are coming back in full force! CBS is running the show with hits like Two and A Half Men and How I Met Your Mother. This year a new one was added to the bunch. The Big Bang Theory is the story of two supergenius roomates Sheldon and Leonard whose lives revolve around numbers, chemical equations and a lot of Science Fiction pop culture. Suddenly there world is turned upside down when the beautiful blonde Penny moves in next door. Now two worlds hystericaly clash as the boys learn how to live life and Penny learns to tolerate them.I was part of a focus group watching the pilot and I was laughing from begining to end. I think it may be hard for the average TV watcher to get some of the jokes and references, but I also feel to really appreciate this show you have have people like this in your life! My own younger brother is a former jock watches sports all the time and would never touch the subjets touched upon on this show. Still, he had me for an older brother so he gets a large portion of the references and therefore he thinks it's one of the best shows on TV. I have to admit I am somewhat classified in the geek category. I love Sci-fi/ fantasy movies, I'm an cartoon watcher, love working on computers and all that stuff. But I have a few of friends that are way over the top than I am. They go to cons, playing rpgs, dress up to movie premeres and know all the details that make this planet tick. So really you may not get this show unless you live it!!!

What can you remember about your days in high school? Do remember crazy sports competitions? What about teachers that bicker like they are 10 year olds because you don't want them to join you on your summer vacation? Well if you don't then you need to see the show 'Azumanga Daioh'If there is one thing that can be said about Japanesse animation is they know how to deliver a great comedy that is so outragious yet so real and relatable at the same time. This is the story about five high school friends and a brand new student named Chio, oh and she is a 10 year old super genius who can almost anything. She is welcomed into the the group and each one of them has their own special characteristics. Sakaki: A very tall and silent girl who is extremly helpful, but has a strange obsession with cats. Tomo: a hyper and overcompetative goof-up. Kagura: A sassy superstar athelete, but can't pass a test to save her life. Nyomi: A book worm who is very worrysome about herself, but will always help a friend. Osaka: A space case as out there as they come. These girls get into everything from putting together high school culture fairs, taking trips to the beach or just cramming away at the books and never getting any work done. Some of the moments in the show are so outlandish you can't do anything but laugh. Each character is so different from the next that each one has something that keeps the show strong from the first episode to the last. The end of the show will defintly pull at your heartstrings reminding you of how you felt when you were graduating high school. This show is one you should see because it will definitely leave an impression and if not will definitely make you feel good.

Linkin Park, probably one of the most origional music acts that I have followed since 'Hybrid Theory'. One of the main acts in the NU Metal movement of the late 90's early 2000's. They were awesome and their songs were great, but for some reason some of the old school metal fans were saying 'oh these guys are just the Backstreet Boys with guitars'. I actually defended LP...until now. What in gods name happened to this group? All the industrial turntables and screaming and heavy metal guitars have been replaced with EMO! Sorry for all you fans of Dashboard Confessionals but I think that EMO has to go. No one wants to listen to songs about being depressed with whinny whinny lyrics, that was The Smashing Pumpkins job and they did it with style. The only song worth listening to is 'What I've Done' because it is the only song on this album that is true LP. I mean I always say that experimenting with new sounds to evolve is a good thing, but if you plan on doing that don't experiment with a style that has been milked for all it is worth for the past 4 years! For Linkin Park's sake I hope they learn a lesson from this disaster.

With 'Spirited Away' taking the oscar in 2001 it was clear that Hayao Miyazaki had finally gotten the appreciation he so long deserved on an international scale. With that it was time to see what lay ahead for his future work. In 2002 Studio Ghibli relased a follow up to my favorite of all his work, 'Whisper of the Heart'. While we are not so sure if 'The Cat Returns' is a sequel or in fact a prequil to his 1995 release it is probably one of the more surprising films he has given to us.'The Cat Returns' brings us the world of Haru, your average high school student who feels she can't get anything right. Then one day she just happens to save cat from being hit by a car. This cat just happened to be the prince of the kingdom of cats and has chosen Haru to be his bride. Haru is not so sure what to think, though she is brought to the kingdom of cats against her will , she wonders if maybe it is time to get a fresh start on her life. Luckally she had recruited some help just in case she changes her mind. The Baron makes his triumphat return along with the pudgy and hillarious Muta. It is a race against time to get Haru back to her world because the longer she ponders she will be going through some dramatic changes.This movie is not a deep meaningful story that will make you cry your eyes out. In fact it is a pure, simple and hysterical story. The Disney version brings some of the greatest talent to the table. Haru is voiced by the famous up an coming Anne Hathaway and Carey Ewells makes his return to voice The Baron. The late Peter Boyle shines as Muta and Elliot Gould and Tim Curry are riots. 'The Cat Returns is a perfect Ghibli film for all ages and it definitely shows that Hayao Miyazaki is far from over when it comes to bringing us his wonderful work.

All right, I promise that this review will be much better than `A New Hope.' Some have called `The Empire Strikes Back' the best sequel ever made, but is it true? From all the sequels I have seen I would have to say yes. The 5th episode in the `Star Wars' saga is by far the most well put together installment. The acting is superb with a lot of heart and the story is just incredible. Before `Revenge Of The Sith' was released this one was my favorite.What makes this movie a cut above the rest is the fact that the forces of good and evil is extremely intense because both sides now know what they are fighting for and each side will stop at nothing to win. You can see it in the way the characters are. The heroes are closer with one another (especially Han and Leia) and the villains are fiercer. I mean Darth Vader has gone so far to the edge he kills his own men for making mistakes...God man! There are also new characters introduced in this film. The bounty hunter Boba Fett, who's past, is now known. He still manages to be the bad ass that he is. Yoda returns (remember we are going from Episode 1) I love Yoda in this movie as apposed to the others because we see how strict of a teacher he can be without the flashy light saber techniques. Of course, who can forget about smooth talker Lando Calaressian? Just like Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams brings a whole new level of scum to the story and it couldn't be more enjoyable to watch. This movie is also C-3P0's time to shine. He delivers the best lines and best comedy and a fun fact for all of you Jar Jar haters...3P0 was hated just as much in 1980 so leave Mr. Binks alone.Even though the entire story is complete on film and the story of Anakin has been seen...the moment where he tells Luke that he is his father is still an amazing moment, probably the greatest moment in movie history. This scene is much more emotional to me because I now that I know what happened to Darth Vader, it makes me upset to see someone who has been through so much reaching out to his own son, but the question that we are left with when the movie comes to a close...Did Darth Vader really want to bring Luke into a world of darkness and evil? Find out the answer in the final installment of this 6-part review.

I thought that Dream Theater's amazing carrer was soon to be coming to an end, until 'Systematic Chaos' was relased. These boys from Long Island knew that it was time to bring something to the fans to let them know that it's not the end just yet. The title of this cd really explains the mood of this album.These guys surley did their homework. Because not only do you see an excellent mix of various sounds from their past records you also get a vibe of the bands entire discography. Through most of the songs you can hear the melocholy softness of 'Falling Into Infinity' to the hard hitting rush of 'Train Of Thought' all around you can the complexity yet steady flow of 'Scenes From A Memory'There was definitley alot of time that went into observing the rest of the metal world. In the past few years Metal has been evolving by looking to the roots of the genre of music to create a new taste for us metalheads. There are displays of that reseach in this album moslty in the European area. Some of the bands you can hear in this cd are Nightwish, Stratovarius, Lacuna Coil and new sounds of Megadeth. Constant Motion is by far the best track on this cd. It is such a smooth flowing in your face hard rock hit. The thing that impressed me the most about this cd is that they had to go back and look at their whole career and realized that they have comoe so far and have evolved so much since 1992, why stop now? The journey has just begun.

Harry Potter is now complete so of course when it comes to new book series & film adaptions, I was curious where I would go. The Hunger Games was one of the first series I went towards, pretty much because of the Harry Potter like hype and books were getting. After reading the first book of course i was on line to see the film.I have to say what impressed me the most about this film was the actors chosen to play these characters. It seems each actor was picked specifically because they could not only act the parts, but their features and their acting styles were prefect fits. Jennifer Lawrence was great as usual. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson officially broken through and will definitely have work after this franchinse. Still, it was their supporting cast that impressed me the most, especially Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci. The story was very well translated to film, though it is very different from the book it was still great how the story got expanded a little to make it watchable. The only thing I didn't like and it seems to be something almost everyone has issues with. The shakey cam was just a little over done, but I understand why it was filmed the way it was.This was one of the best films I have seen this year and the book along side the film was definitely something I did not expect. A very dark story about survival in a very extreme future. I am hoping that the rest of the films are able to be up to par with this one...minus shakey cam of course.

Things look grim for Goku as the lethal Majin Buu has shed his infancy to become the true ruthless killing machine he was. Everyone even Goku doesn't think he can destroy him. The only chance that he has is to trust in the hearts of the people he has sworn to protect all those years ago. The final showdown begins as enemies finally put aside their differences and see each other as equals, but more importantly as friends.Dragon Ball Z comes to an incredible conclusion in the final two DBZ sagas. These battles are as intense as they come. They are filled with action and heavy hitting. This is pretty much what the DBZ fans crave, a true Super Saiyan extravaganza. In the end the wrongs are set right and Earth finally returns to a time of peace...or at least until the next adventure!While the ending is a little on the week side it is nice to get a little epilouge to see all the characters grown up and even get the biggest surprise of all. Goku has become a GRANDFATHER!!! They say that Dragon Ball Z is the greatest action cartoon ever made, now that I have seen the entire series from begining to end I think I can agree.

Hopefully those of you have enjoyed my reviews of various cds and the Invader Zim volumes will be drawn to this six part review of probably the greatest story ever placed on the big screen. In 1999 we Star Wars fans were finally brought to the very beginning of the grand story that George Lucas created almost 30 years ago. We were given the origins of the true main character Anakin Skywalker, the profited chosen one the Jedi said would bring balance to the Force and destroy the dark side once and for all. It is not the best piece of the story, but not being one of those truly obsessed fans one has to realize that in a grand tale you always have to begin somewhere and an introduction will be a bit dull and a bit boring because it is not going to give the watcher what he or she wants. That piece is the climax to this story, which would not be seen until 2005.All and all the movie is fun to watch. The characters are well put together, even though the dialogue is a bit gut wrenching, but hey Lucas was never one to focus on characters. The casting for all the roles were very well chosen and yes I am a supporter of Jar Jar Binks. Although many obsesses will wish for his death he is an essential part to the story and that is revealed in the end of this film where two races of one planet unite to oppose a threat.I feel that Lucas did a great job beginning his space epic and putting all the characters into place so that they will end up where they should be in the very last chapter of the saga. 'The Phantom Menace' is fun to watch the characters are surely memorable and let's face it.... the Pod Race was pretty cool. I give this film 3 stars just based on the fact that this is just a huge tease for what is yet to come and that even though there is no sign of Anakin linked to Darth Vader as of yet its still great to see that he was born into that galaxy far far away as an innocent boy not knowing where his adventures would take him. That is what made the fans keep coming back for more.

Red VS. Blue The Blood Gultch Chronicles was a huge leap forward in animation and entertainment. A great story with memorable characters throw together just by using an ordinary video game with inginuity. After a success full 100 episode run anyone that was a fan would be curious to know where the next step would take us. Well it took us to the next part of the story, Red VS. Blue Reconstruction.Now I loved the first RVB and I was glad to see that the creators used the same cast of characters and stayed very loyal to the origonal story plot points. There was just a few things that just left me upset with this 20 epsiode spin off. First off the transition from a plain old goofy story line to a more serious mystery story line that leads to something way off from where the show was origionally going. I am always a fan of origionallity and a good story, but I feel that changing the mood and flow of the story really needs to have some kind of a transitional period. I will admit that the first few episodes of Reconstruction were very funny, but this story and the whole care of Project Freelance and Agent Washington was just a bit too dark too soon. Another thing I was upset about was the elimination of two major characters, Donut and Tucker. Tucker happens to be my favorite RVB cahracter so I am a bit guilty showing bias. Still, there really wasn't much of a story as to why these characters were missing from this project. Even when one may have been mentioned they sort of just dropped the subject and moved on. There was however a great story line involving Tex and how she was linked to characters like Wyoming and I was very shocked with the whole origin story of Church. On that possitive note I do like that fact that Sarge and his goofball lackies were there for a good chuckle here and there and Caboose is always appreciated to the good news is Reconstruction is not a total loss.Now there is a third series airing as we speak called Red VS. Blue: Recreation. So far what I have seen is good, because they went back to the origional theme of the story as well as throwing a few more surprises our way. So the final verdict on Reconstrution...you have to see the first installment of RVB and you have to see this installment otherwise you are sure to be lost in the machenima madness.

It took George Lucas almost 30 years to finally answer the question that plagued millions upon millions of fans ever since 1980. How did Anakin Skywalker become the ruthless Darth Vader? Now in `Revenge Of The Sith' we all sit back (for some moments reluctantly) and watch as the frustrated young Jedi turns to the ways of darkness.`Revenge Of The Sith' in my eyes is by far the best installment of the entire `Star Wars' Saga. Not because is gives me closure, not because Jar Jar Binks didn't say a word or any of the other typical answers the fans give. I love this episode because George Lucas went further than he ever went to create one extremely emotional film. There are those including myself who actually shed a tear when Anakin is seen slaughtering Jedi...and even though you never see him kill the younglings you still get a sharp stabbing pain in your heart knowing he did. Also when the Jedi fall to the clones, Yoda places himself in exile and Obi-Wan expressing his true feelings for his fallen friend you just don't see that in the other movies. The fights in this film are by far the most exciting because of the causes they are being fought over. I first heard about the fabled Obi-Wan Anakin fight over lava when I was 14...but never did I expect at age 23 that the fight and the amazing score to be so powerful and emotional...it truly kept me on the edge of my seat. If this movie should be nominated for any Oscar it should be for the scoreOnce you see this movie it will only make you want to pull out the original trilogy just to put that little light of hope back in your system after going through 2 and half hours of darkness. The ending also brings back that feeling you first had when the flagship soars right onto the screen in the opening of `A New Hope.' The minute you see Luke being delivered to his family you can't help but remember the feeling of reaching for the stars when Luke 17 years later will be seen staring at the Binary sunset in the sands of Tatooine. For Lucas and many hard core fanatics this may be the end...but for me after seeing this film all I can say is the battle may be over...but the true war is just beginning.

It took me forever to get a chance to see this movie. Hearing what so many people had to say about it I was hoping it was truly going to live up to its hype. Empire Records is truly a fun extremely down to Earth teen comedy. This was probably the last of the true comedies that really gave it's audience a true life look at a bunch of kids just trying to have a good time during their supposed last day of work. `Empire Records' is a blend of `Dazed and Confused' and `Clerks' and is a great watch from start to finish filled with crazy antics and mindless philosophical conversation. The cast is truly one for the record books. This is the only movie I probably will ever enjoy with Renee Zelweger in it...and its quite strange seeing her play the role of a labeled slut. Liv Tyler has an excellent breakthrough performance and of course we all know where she went. The best cast member by far is the highly recognizeable face of Ethan Embry. Every scene he in, is flat out comic genius, it is a darn shame he can't get signed on to other successful projects because he really does have talent. I guess you can blame corporate Hollywood for that.What makes this movie truly memorable is the soundtrack. `Empire Records could not have come out at a more perfect time. It was the final year of the early 90s grunge era. With music from bands like Sponge, Gin Blossoms and The Cranberries, like the bands the movie has become a cult classic for those who know that music is the best way to stick it to the man.

Normally when a movie like this one rolls around I would be first on line to see it. I am a huge fan of gangster movies. From Goodfellas to even the over the top Dick Tracy, the whole fast paces tommy gun bonanza is something that just gets me going. When I saw that Johnny Depp was going to play one of the most notorious gangsters of the 1930's, along with a stellar cast I thougt 'Public Enemies' was going to be one of the greatest. An anticipation for seeing in theaters went from DVD anticipation to just seeing it on HBO on demand.I really don't plan on going into too many details, but this movie made 'Twilight' look oscar worthy. The movie was way too slow and just plain jumbled. Sometimes I had no idea what was going on. The acting was bland and that is what made me so upset because you have Christian Bale, Billy Crudup, Marion Colliard and tons of famous names...I couldn't even finish watching the movie. After about an hour in i turned off in disgust.For a movie of this calibur I would wonder what went wrong in making this movie. The good things is this movie is not going to kill any of these fine actors careers hence to future projects such as Alice In Wonderland, Batman 3 and Inception. So you can by all means skip this one.

Last year the entertainment world hit a major road block. Movies were put on hold and television shows were asked to cut their seasons short. Many dissapointed fans were very upset and of course what do they do they point their fingers are the wrong people.One of the shows that unfortunatly went down hard in the writters strike was Heroes. After an incredible first season we were left with an extremly short second season with a sub-par plot. Blame the big heads of entertainment, blame writters, heck blame all the people that destoryed our economy, but don't take it out on the people we tune into every monday night to see their adventures. I have to give Tim Kring and company an A for effort as they managed to fit an entire story into a span of 12 episodes, that's as long as an entire season on HBO people! I loved the new characters that they brought into the show like Maya and Elle. Of course I will watch Kristen Bell even if it was her on a cheesy reality show. I loved how they brought us inside the Company and showed us the origins of how and why it was formed. I think the only downside for me was Peter's story in the whole second season. I do beleive if they had entire 22 episode season there would have been much more to his story. Now as we are about so enter Season 3 dubed 'Villians' I feel that Heroes will be back in it's groove and redeem the show bringing it back to it's awesome glory.

Studio Ghibli had been belting out movies since the early 1980s. They delt with everything from epic fantasy to coming of age films. But, nothing would have prepared the world for 'Princess Mononoke'. Not only is this film the 2nd highest grossing film in Japan, it is also the film that finally gave Studio Ghibili notice in the United States.'Princess Mononoke' shows the epic battle of man against nature and how the constant motion of human evolution has the ability to destroy the purity of nature. Though there are no physical elements of good against evil the true villans in this film are greed, power and anger. You see characters like Asuyaka, who comes from a race of humans that have strong bonds with nature. Lady Hiboshi who wants to move the human race forward with science and technology only to create the perfect human utopia. Then you have Princess Mononoke, a girl who was tossed by her parents to the wolf gods out of fear, but only to be raised as a daughter of nature and learn the magic of the ancient ways. These characters clash for the purpose of moving forward, but also for the chance to co-exist. I feel that is what makes this film so appealing because of the similariteis in life. The topics of polotics, science and religion always cause a stir in us eventhough there can be ways to have them all work united.This was a diffenent film for Miyazaki, but you still manage to see the magical elements that make his signature work. It is a film rich in detail and emotion. You get lost in the vast landscapes and the relationships of the characters you sometimes forget you are watching an animated film. Though this movie may not be for everyone because of the PG-13 rating for the epic battles and language, there are still elements that bring out Miyazaki's true colors and this film is a marvel worthy to be seen.

Things are just not getting easier for Ranma Saotome, as 'Ranma ?' heads into its fifth season. For some strange reason things aren't getting much better from the previous year.This season of the show is more highs and lows, rather than a constant flow of entertaining episodes. There were certain points as I was watching this season where I was just bored. Still, I have to admit when the show reached its high points it got really good. One of the things I did realize in this season was there were a lot of menacing new enemies and they were all no bigger than a toddler. The bun headed gang, the matriarch of the House of Martial Arts Tea Ceremony, The Frog Master and many more. This season also had some great stories that featured Ryoga, the viewers really get to see him in a whole new light and that he really is not such a bad guy. Probably the most dramatic of the episodes is when Akane, and her sisters' find out they are engaged to a master of Martial Arts Dinning. Unfortunately there are many more lows the episode where Kuno finds out his dad is the principal of Furinkan High and also the fact that there are very few appearances of Shampoo, Mousse and Ukyo, when they are there the show is good. I do have to admit that when the season comes to a close the last few episodes really save it. The last 5 episodes are hysterical.Like the fourth season watch the fifth as well to stay with in the flow of the story. One thing you have to give this show credit for is the fact that the origional point of the story is still clear and its what keeps all of us fans watching. This time around Akane is still trying to figure out if Ranma really likes her and the funny part is Ranma is suddenly realizing could the feelings he actually has for Akane...be love?*Recommended Episode: Into the Darkness*

The Darkness might possibly be the most innovative band out on the scene today. Their first album was absoultaly fantastic...but this one....well all I could say was Yes! 'One Way Ticket' is exactly what true rock fans want to hear from their bands, something fresh to make our jaws hit the floor just as hard as the first time we heard them. The boys bring the loud and melodic sounds of Arena Rock back with a vengence. The use of instruments are as innovative as Rush, the vocals have the power to resurect Freddie Mercury from the dead. And who doesn't love the hair metalesuqe use of spandex? No reason to rank any songs because they are all awesome, but I can almost guarentee that 'Hazel Eyes' will be played at least twice the first time you hear this album. BUY IT! HEAR IT! LOVE IT TO DEATH!!!

'Ted' is a movie was very interested in seeing during its theatrical release. As a fan of Seth Macfarlane I was eager to see what he would bring his fan base. He gave his fans exactly what they expected. 'Ted' is film filled with belly laughs and fun to be had. The cast does their jobs at being rude crude and totally inappropriate and at the same time gives the viewer a heartfelt story about friendship. Although being the perfectionist that Seth Macfarlane is I feel that there were certain points of the movie that looked like they went the extra mile when they really didn't have to. I don't want to spoil it so you will have to see it for yourself. This may not be a film that people will want to watch over and over, but those who love this kind of humor and love the artist that began his career in 1999 to purposely break all possible barriers will definitely enjoy 'Ted'

Paranorman, is a film that truly stands out along with all the Pixar and Dreamworks family films. It is a film that bends the rules with its style of story telling and cast of characters. To sum it all up it is The Sixth Sense for children. It is a story that actually delivers a powerful message about knowing that it is ok if you are different than everyone else.The positives in this film are the tributes to horror films of the 1980s and the jokes that were thrown in for the adult appeal. Also, being that it is stop motion shows that this style of film making is far from dead. As a matter of fact it is a style that was used many times in 2012 and it shows major signs of strength and improvement in a world of film making dominated by computers. However, the film is far from perfect as far as story, but it does keep the view entertained and apparently it got some Oscar nods so there was obviously something done right here.Paranorman is worth seeing at least once and it is definitely a film that can start a huge trend in animation. Like the film stresses you can't be a hero, by being normal.

Dragon Ball Z, is a show that just sucked me in from the very first episode I ever saw. The intensity and amazing fights and very adult like premise just made me a fan instantaniously. I had always known that the show Dragon Ball existed, but it took such a long time for America to get it uncut not to mention getting the rest of the show. Funimation finally put the whole Dragon Ball saga into season box sets and affordable prices and of cousre like the first time around Dragon Ball is the last one to be released.Most of you know the whole Dragon Ball Z saga, but now we are taken back to a much smaller and simpler time in the world of the innocent, yet vallient Goku. Goku is just a boy living alone in the wild until one day a beautiful teenaged girl named Bulma ends up on his doorstep looking for something called Dragon Ball. Goku had no idea he had it nor did he have any idea what a girl was! Suddenly Goku's simple world is blown wide open and he joins Bulma on her mission to find all seven of the Dragon Balls. On their quest they meet many foes and also a few loyal friends and who knew what this simple mission would turn into years down the line. Maybe..Goku will finally figure out a few things about himself he never would have expected.This show is very different from Dragon Ball z. It such a delight to watch. It is filled with lots of laughs and a Dragon Ball Z fan will enjoy finally seeing where the story began and soon to come all the events that lead up to episode 1 of Dragon Ball Z. I think the part that the fans will like the most is just watching Goku and his friends grow up with each new adventure.

In the new chapter of Studio Ghibli it was time for Haiyo to let his son Goro Miyazaki try his hand at a new animated film. This time around we get `Tales From Earthsea' based on the famous fantasy novels. I was very much anticipating the chance to finally see this film, because while it came out in 2006 due to conflicts in America with their cable channel SyFi miniseries we had to wait a solid 4 years for Disney to finally have the rights and release the original animated film.Much like the mess that this film endured to get to the United States the film is no different. I feel that this movie was a B version of `The Princess Mononoke'. The story and the characters had so much potential seeing the scale and the depth of the story that revolves around corruption and inner evil inside good people. However, the plot is underdeveloped there are parts of the movie that make very little sense that you get lost in the film and even worse a great voice cast that really doesn't get the chance to do great things like the casts in Studio Ghiblis past. I am happy that they didn't change the voice cast that was used because this animated film did premiere in 2006 and The United Kingdom did give the film its own dubbed version featuring Timothy Dalton and Willam Dafoe.Unfortunately, this film didn't grab me as I would have hoped, in fact I almost fell asleep watching it. I am also a little unhappy, because it seems that Studio Ghibli is not really going with original stories anymore. If you take a look at where Ghibli began and where they are now their films are starting to become a hit or miss. I am looking forward to the next film this coming February, I just hope it is good.

The main motive of the success that is 'Family Guy' is to rip upon all that is pop culture politics and everything in between. But, give creator Seth McFarlane a chance to make fun of Star Wars... and you get a true comical masterpiece.We begin by understanding what exactly is the concept of parody. A parody is taking an original piece of work and mocking it by adding crude comedy, slapstick and the possible musical number. Mel Brooks did it well, Trey Parker and Matt Stone did it well and let's not forget David Zucker's classic 'Airplane!' But, when it comes to the holy of holys' The creators of Family Guy did something much more.'Family Guy: Blue Harvest' is actually the first Star Wars film shrunk into 45 minutes with of course the usual Family Guy humor. There are no made up characters, just the cast members of 'Family Guy' playing the 'Star Wars' characters. There are actual lines from the orginal movie used and then given a spin. There are also comedic lines that play upon the 'Star Wars' lore to please the true fans To put it in lamenst terms this is pretty much if George Lucas intended on 'Star Wars' to be a space comedy and not a dramtic fantasy space opera. You still have the traditional 'Family Guy' brand comedy, meaning make sure you have either seen a lot of movies, watched a ton of TV and played bored/video games in your years. The other thing I love is the characters still have the same personalities they bring on the actual show in this special. The perfect example would be Quagmire and Cleavland playing C-3PO and R2-D2.This was one of the best 'Family Guy' episodes I had ever seen since the show first aird after the 1999 Super Bowl. I am also glad that this specific episode was not included in one of the series volumes. Like 'Stewie Griffen: The Untold Story' 'Blue Harvest' is in fact a separate entity on it's own and to be placed along side the series. Sure you have to shell out some extra cash, but believe me, this is so worth it. I mean even the DVD box and DVD main menu are an exact replica of the origional! I am very excited to know that the crew of 'Family Guy' will in fact be making two more specials spoofing the next two 'Star Wars' films. I am happy to know that they will also be sold on their own and still keeping to the new tradition that has been put in place thanks to 'Blue Harvest.' I sure hope that there will be a prequel trilogy as well. So 'Star Wars' and 'Family Guy' fans alike enjoy this very sepcial gift and begin a new tradition as I have. Watch the original film and cap it off with 'Family Guy'!

Megadeth, one of the forefathers of thrash metal has returned with yet another album that will toss Metallica further into the abyss of sell outs and has beens. 'United Abominations' is without a doubt one of the freshest compelations that Dave Mustane has released in a long while. Though the topics may be touchy especially with all the happenings in politics in the past seven years, this messege is brought to its listeners with a fantastic 'score'. Mustane really goes back to basics reminding the masses of what Metal always has been. With elements of classic thrash as well as epic and 1980s Brittish Steel. Also Megadeth has done alot of work to really bring out the best for Metal from a vocal standpoint. Dave Mustaine actually makes the best effort yet to sing along with special guests like Chritsine Scabbia from Lacuna Coil. This album is a very impressive piece and a must have in your metal collection.

I saw the trailer for this movie around haloween and while watching I was trying to figure out who in the holy of holies would want to make this movie? When one of the most brilliant film makers name came up at the very end I scratched every previous thought and wanted to see it immeditly.'Hostel' is a fantastic film weather you want to beleive it or not. Even though there are moments that you really wish you didn't have to see the audience is given characters that are developed so perfectly in such a short amount of time that you actually have feelings for the good guys and want the bad guys to be punished. Beleive me you get nothing but a great movie with Hostel.I can understand why Quinten Tarentino chose to work on this movie. There is a very big Tarentino vibe throughout this movie. There is gore blended with quirky action and plenty of humor throughout. Don't even think about the grusome scenes from what I saw no one else in my theater did.

When I first heard 'Over My Head (Cable Card)' I immidiatly wanted to know who the band was. The Fray's cd is a very well done debut cd. It is one of those cds you play if you had a long day at the office or are spending time with a friend or significant other if you need some nice background music. The songs are easy to listen to and soothing and beleive me we all need this kind of music in our lives even us headbangers.Still...I am concerned for this band for one reason. I think The Fray is trying way to hard to sound like Coldplay. The use of the piano and soft sounding lyrics with the occassional hooky guitar is tell me yea we are trying to make it big but to some extent on the coattails of a more successful band.This is an album that will probably get mixed reviews from the masses but if The Fray wants to remain around for a long time I beleive they need to really prove they can create a sound all their own and really make their mark in the music world.

Everyone of us has a favorite muppet, that is how well Jim Henson stood out as one of the most creative minds for family programing and now his legacy is remembered in a box set of the three non muppet films. These movies are nothing but pure grandure of fantasy used to stimulate the mind and senses. The stories are origional family friendly and a pleasure to watch over and over again. Jim Henson worked with other creative minds of the time such as Rick Callum, Frank Oz and of course one of Jim Hensons' equils George Lucas. No wonder these movies are so good.The Dark Crystal, the first of these films is Lord Of The Rings with muppets. Its the story of a dying world and two races of creatures created by the breaking of the keeper of the world, the Dark Crystal. Now it is up to Jen, the last of his race to unite the crystal before the three suns of the planet align. Dark Crystal is an eye popping marvel. It doesn't move too quickly but that is how Jim Hensons' work is most of the time. But just watching the fact that there is not a single human in this movie and that its all done through the magic of puppetry and voice acting keeps you in your seat itching to see what happens next.Labyrinth, probably the fan favorite of the three is the most entertaining in my eyes. Picture a twisted Wizard of Oz, with goblins. It's the story of a young, but still hot Jennifer Connely as she wishes her baby brother is taken away by the infamous Gobin King (That is David Bowie and yes he is singing!)Now she muse get to the caslte through a puzzeling maze filled with creatures you have never seen anywhere else before her brother becomes a goblin. This movie is great its a must see.The last one was made long after Jim Henson left us, but the story of Mirrormask stays true to the legacy of Jim Henson storytelling. Filled with stimulating images, crazy creatures and a important moral to lesson to learn.This collection goes right up there with the great movie trilogies of the past 35 years. It is worth every penny and there is no doubt in my mind you will want to watch them as much as you can.

It has been 10 years since the pure hearted Goku saved Earth from the menace of Buu. Since he departed with the innocent Uub, a great deal as changed. Earth has been at peace and all of the characters we have enjoyed watching have grown up. Now, Goku has emerged only to find his very first enemy (quite old I might add) preparing to make a wish on the mysterious Black Star Dragon Balls. Like the first time Pilaf makes a mistake and wished that Goku be turned back into the child he first met all those years ago. Now the Dragon Balls have been scattered across the galaxy and if they are not returned to the planet the wish was made on in one year Earth will be destroyed. It is now up to the pint sized Goku, the matured Trunks and Gokus' fully grown granddaughter Pan to head out and search for the Dragon Balls.Dragon Ball GT is the final chapter in the great Dragon Ball story and since its release in 1996 it received a great deal of flack from critics and fans alike. There are some strong points as well as weak points in this series, but summed all up it passes. I love the constant aging of the characters it is great to see characters like Trunks, Goten and Pan all grown up. Still as Vegeta says in the second episode the DB crew has grown soft. The show dropped a good portion of the drama and it seems that the writers tried far too hard to fill in the story with goofy and extremely cheesy moments. I mean yea Dragon Ball is known for that humor, but a good portion of it just seems so out of place. The fight scenes with the main villainous characters are awesome. They hit harder and are much more intense than Z. It is great to know that they still are bent on making stronger villains causing the heroes to tap into deeper stronger powers. So far the first two sags of this short lived chapter I am sure are just the beginning of better things to come. So I guess now that Season one is wrapped up I have to see the final season. I just hope these little misses are taken care of.

So DBZ is back and we flash forward in time seven years. Gohan is fully grown and off to high school handling problems a little different from fighting. There are two new additions to the DBZ gang in the hilarious tag team of Trunks and Goten and now that Cell is gone Mr. Satan hogs all the glory of being the greatest hero and saving the world.This point of the DBZ series has possitives and negatives. The parts I like are the expansion of the Otherworld universe showing us that King Kai is not the only omnipitant being in the world beyond. In fact there are more powerful Kais that have even bigger roles to play in this story. Explaning the world of Dragon Ball Z outside of fighting is great to see because this show has a lot more to offer than just amazing fights. This season brings back the old comedic charm of Dragon Ball. The only negative I see is just the story once again grinds to a hault and it just moves so slow. So what do you do you bring back the World Martial Arts Tournament. Unfortunatly when the fighting is only for fun it just makes you crave another villian. Still, the interesting part is there is a villian among the heroes the question is who could it be?

As the action packed adventures of `He-Man' and `The Transformers were coming to an end and `The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' were yet to be unleashed there was `Ducktales' `Ducktales' followed the epic and humorous adventures of "Uncle" Scrooge McDuck and his trio of crafty nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie as they traveled the globe in search for the ultimate treasure hunt.This show was Disney at its prime. I don't think there is a soul on this Earth that disliked this cartoon. It had everything a television show needed with out the use of extremes. The characters were great, the stories were perfect and the theme song is unforgettable. This show is probably one of the greatest to emerge out of the `80's lasting into the early `90's. `Ducktales' led the pack of the Disney Afternoon block introducing a slew of new characters and even a feature full-length film. Heck!, this cartoon even generated a spin-off in Darkwing Duck!I wouldn't be surprised of this DVD is on everyone's wish list. Now that the first 28 episodes have been put into this first DVD volume it is officially on everyone's must have list.Oh a minor note for all of you complainging about the pilot...the pilot was split into 5 episodes and shown in one of the later seasons so don't worry it's coming.

I remember the days of watching the `Disney Sunday Movie' and awaiting the classic Disney cartoons that would come on right after. My all time favorites were the hysterical romps of the mischievous chipmunk duo. When I found out that they were to star in a brand new animated series following `Ducktales', I was very interested to see how it would turn out.Thankfully `Chip `N Dale's Rescue Rangers' became another successful Disney show that remains one of the biggest cult classics to emerge out of the late `80s. All of a sudden these two unruly rodents became small time (and I use the term loosely) crime fighters. Along with two mice and a fly, this band mystery solving critters got into capers way over their heads. Thanks to crafty wit and awesome gear made out pencils and paperclips, they always came out on top.Don't expect any drug references or subliminal messages from this crime-solving bunch. The Rescue Rangers like `Ducktales' is wholesome entertainment for all ages. Having the first 28 episodes of this show released on DVD is a burst of excitement for me. It's great to know that shows like this one are being released so people can enjoy the phenomenal magic and fun that this show brought to the small screen. Now if only `Darkwing Duck' can find it's way to DVD that would make my day.

I am shocked at all the negative reviews that are being posted about this exceptional album. I mean don't get me wrong there are bad things to say as well as good, but everything must be taken in stride. I have been a Dream Theater fan since 1999 and I must say that this is one of the few groups who need to be heard. Still...if you are looking to get into this group I am sorry to say...you may not want to start with Train of Thought. The message Dream Theater sends is a very cool one, especially with `As I Am', basically giving the finger to the mainstream. Still, with this new album, Dream Theater didn't really try to come up with something fresh as they usually do. In 2002 When Six Degrees was released it was very impressive to see Dream Theater get extremely heavy in sound, but when Train of Thought came out it was as if Six Degrees was released again. I think Dream Theater should go back to their previous work and try and figure out a way to blow their loyal fans out of the water like they use to. I am sure we would all love a Metropolis Pt. 3.

The cgi film genre has really gone above and beyond anything we have come to expect. Since the release of the classic Toy Story in 1995, the computer animated film has been taken up by all the major studios and even introduces digital 3-D technology. Still, with this breakthrough art film taboo at this point I feel that now business is taking over and it's up to the cooporate people to just get the movie to the big screen so people can spend their money just because it looks cool.That brings me to Kung Fu Panda. Now, I unfortunatly missed this movie in its theatrical release, but I had heard good things about the film and that it was even up for the Oscar. I saw it and wondered what the academy was smoking and why they weren't willing to share. Did I seriously miss something with this movie? First of all the movie was not funny. I don't about the movie going masses, but Jack Black needed to try and learn how to diversify is acting. I really thought that after his role in King Kong he would have gone on to do some great work. Instead we him doing the exact same thing in every movie he makes. My other problem was the cast. You would have guessed that Jackie Chan was in this movie? Maybe if they would have given him or any of the other supporting members of the Furious Five more than 2 lines you would have?Personally I don't even want to keep talking about this disgrace of a film. Besides the maginificent work on putting together the fight scenes this movie was pretty horrible. I once thought that Disney had finally gotten knocked off the pedistil as the number one maker of animated films. Nowadays I realize I may be wrong. You have to see who wants to bring a good film to the masses and who just wants to make the big bucks. It really is a numbers game when it comes down to it.First Pixar Toy Story 1995 First DreamWorks Antz 1997Pixar: 10 soon to be 11 with Toy Story 3 Dreamworks: 15 Soon to be 17 with How To Train Your Dragon and OobermindHow many won oscars? so far it's Disney 4 and Dreamworks 2I guess Disney still has the magic and for the record Up was amazing!

Since X-MEN hit the big screen in 2000 the comic book film had taken a huge leap forward. With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly. Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider-Man) the dreadful(Hulk), the Unknown (Sin City), and the renewed. (Batman Begins)Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen. It all begins with the legendary Marvel character Iron Man. This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart. With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero. Now he has created a powerful exo-skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good. All that with just a little time to show off is not too shabby.This movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre. It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable. An excellent origin story by director John Farravau. A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast. It's fast, dramatic, humerous and flat out fun. Still, this is only the begining of a much bigger picture in the Marvel film universe. But, you won't know that until the very end.

As the new millenum had finally arrived Studio Ghibli graced the world with 'Spirited Away'. This movie took the world of Hayao Miyazaki and threw it right into your face saying 'This is the work of Studio Ghibli. Watch our movies!!!' So we listened and to show America's graditude 'Spirited Away' won the second Oscar for Best Animated Feature.This is a story of Chihiro. A spoiled brat who never has to do anything. Though she gets anything she wants whenever she wants she still feels alone and ignored by the world. On the move to their new house Chihiro's family spots an abandoned amusement park. What they don't know is that it is a resort to the spirits that walk the Earth at night. Now her paretns broke the rules and turned into pigs so it's up to Chihiro to break the curse. On her dangerous yet sometimes humerous quest she learns what it is like to prove to yourself in the world and you can do great things.This is a very different film for Hayao Miyzaki. This is a story that plays upon some of the most bizzare fantasy stories. It is also a movie that can be a bit weird and sometimes disturbing. Yet what you see will blow your mind for it is so origional and so mind bending you will be craving to see what happens next. At this point Studio Ghibli is a world renound phenomenon and Disney is giving it a helping hand to get all the films to the world. 'Spirited Away' is a real milestone for Ghibli because once this movie received it's Oscar it was embraced by a whole new wave of fans. After that they craved more and thus the films like 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Pom Poko' were finally brought over seas and now one can only think about the next wave of films that is on its way to us.(End of Volume 1)

I don't know what it is about HBO, but they just know how to make the best shows. Entourage was one of the few shows that I watched religously when it was on the air and when it ended I was so sad to see it go. As someone who will probably never get to Hollywood it was grea to see a show that was about 4 guys from my hometown making it big and yet amonst all the glitz and glamour managed to stay tough, brash and of course together as friends.Many people did give this show a little flack after season 3 because was apparently not as great as the first 3 seasons. While I will admit that season 4 was a little as a whole the story was rich in detail and character development and it all fit in the end. Of course the characters are some of the best ever put onto television and it is so hard to single one out as the best because they are all such great characters. Of course having a bunch of famous faces show up and just act as normal people is great too. It is a story about a life most of us wish we had and yet when I wathced the show, I felt like I have a good life and felt at ease as I watched.This is just an entertaining and fun show. It has moments that will make you laugh, tense up and even be left dumbfounded based on what you see. It will only make you crave more with each episode.

I remember when I first heard "Kyrptonite" on the radio and how eager I was to get the debut release from a no name group called 3 Doors Down. Since then I have eagerly awaited their sophmore release and now "Away From The Sun" is finally here. What the hell happened?! The great origional sound that I heard the first time around just got up and left. After hearing the entire album I am sad to say I am extremly dissapointed. The songs are all bland and tastless, in fact it's nothing but mainstreem rock or as I prefer to call it... ! I would advise a true fan of this group to count your blessings and listen to "The Better Life", which is infact the better record. I gave this album one star because "Away From The Sun" only has one decent track "When I'm Gone". Unless 3 Doors Down goes back to the way they were, I am gone!Again, a very interesting turn of events since I wrote this review. Since this release all those years ago I have never purchased another 3 Doors Down record. To sweeten how accurate my review was I sold my 'Better Life' album. I'm telling you...it feels so good to be right sometimes.

I have to say the country of Japan has got to share its secrets with America in regards to film and television. Anime has recently grown in tremendous thanks to shows like Pokemon, Dragonball Z, and the Studio Gibli movies. Still, there is a much larger world that hasn't even begun to grow on this side of the globe.Enter the world of romantic comedy anime style and its ringleader the ever-popular `Ranma '. This is the story of a boy named Ranma and his father and their journey to become the greatest martial artists with a major twist. On their journey they trained in the Valley of Cursed Springs, where within every pool a creature died a tragic death. Any being that happens to fall into one of the pools would take the shape of the creature that drowned in it. Out of all the cursed pools which one does our strapping young Ranma happen to fall into? The spring of the drowned girl! So now every time he gets wet, Ranma transforms into a spunky cute red headed girl. To change back he must douse himself with hot water...but it's only a matter of time until he finds a way to get wet again. If this idea of a story doesn't strike you as hilarious I don't know what will!Now Ranma just found out he is to wed his fathers best friends daughter Akane. Unfortunately they don't like each other very much and he has to live under her roof until they get married. Get ready for the wacky first season of this Japanese phenomenon as Ranma begins a new chapter of his life with a new school, new friends, new enemies and even old enemies! The best part about all this mayhem is which Ranma are all these nut jobs looking for? And are they out for love...or revenge!?*Recommended Episode: Enter Ryoga The Eternal Lost Boy *

Believe it or not at one point in time I actually hated this band...no joke! Coldplay can now proudly say that they have officially conquered the music world. With tickets being sold for almost a grand to see their shows...I would agree. Coldplay returns after an almost 4 year hiatus from their grammy winning sophomore release only to return with something even better. `X&Y' is the same old Coldplay from a mood standpoint. Meloncholly tunes that are fun to relax to, but this time Coldplay really tried to experiment with new sounds. Coldplay uses the neo-new wave sound through the uses of keyboard effects on songs like `Square One and the self titled track, probably to throw in the science theme. There are also familiar sounds featured in the hit single `Speed of Sound' and `Fix You' Then what makes this album really special is new song themes and tunes that make people listen and say..."Wait...that was Coldplay?" Songs such as those are. `A Message' and my favorite from the album `Swallowed In The Sea.' `X&Y' is all there was to be expected from this now super group and I am hoping that they will keep finding new ways to continue pleasing their fans. Being compared to bands like U2...I am sure they are hoping the same.

What can be said about Black Sabbath? A band way before it's time from the grit and grime of Birmingham England came the sound that would officially branch off into the fast, powerful and sometimes scary genere of Heavy Metal. For far too long while Black Sabbath has been known for its legendary vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and the dark guitars of Tony Iommi there hasn't been much out there that told all the fans of Sabbath that there was a whole other chapter of this bands story.I myself always knew there was Sabbath after Ozzy, but I had no idea that the lead singer was the great Ronny James Dio! Now finally The Dio Years have been released and I have to say I am amazed. Dio really brings a whole new level to this band. While the sound really leans towards the sounds of epic and power metal the true Sabbath sound is still there. I beleive with no disrespect to the Prince of Darkness that Dio gives more definition to this band. You can hear it in the songs like Heaven and Hell, Die Young and many others. This CD is a very important one to listen to because Dio is very unappreciated and this chapter in Sabbaths now legendary career really needs to be brought out into the open so the fans know that even without Ozzy Sabbath was still able to play hard and bring their sound to the masses as they should.

I will up front here, music has gone no where for these past 10 years. Unless you count releases from bands have been around before 2000 or a real dimond in the rough like Coldplay this whole decade has been nothing but re-hash of bubblegum pop, Hip-hop that has lost it's realy roots and Emo, that makes you want to claw your face off. Then, out of no where Paramore comes along. Where do you put them? In the Power pop/Emo catagory, but there is something about them that makes them stand out. They have Haley Williams singing. I always say that when a female is taking the lead vocals the music always sounds better. The sound of a womans voice in rock makes the music easier to bare and less annoying! Thanks to this young lady Paramore is actually a sound that is great to listen to. There is not one song on this album I don't like and the loud guitars defintelly make this album blast worthy in the car. Paramore is a pretty fresh act being the owner of both albums 'Riot' is one step forward if you listen to songs like 'Misery Business', 'When It Rains' and the very off beat 'Fences' I hope this quartet decides to move forward with their sound and release an enjoyable third album soon.

My best friend of 22 years was one of the first people that began ranting and raving about Studio Ghibli films and around that same time Spirited Away had just won the 2nd Oscar for Best Animated Film in Academy Awards history. Being a fan of the more popular anime shows and movies such as Dragon Ball Z and Akira I knew that these magical films would soon be seen.In 1984 the very first film by this group of talanted animators was born. 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' tells a story of a far off future where a strange toxic jungle is engulfing the entire planet Earth. Through time there were many battles between the insects and surviving human kingdoms trying to keep both worlds far from one another. Then there is the kingdom of the valley of the wind ruled by Princess Nausicaa a fearless and caring girl who had always been able to find the beauty in everything, even the toxic jungle. Suddenly her kingdom is invaded by one of the most ruthless of human kingdoms. Saying they are there to protect her people she along with a cunning young prince find that the humans are hatching a plot that only Nausicaa can prevent.Thanks to Walt Disney Studios, particularly John Lasseter of Pixar these unbeleiveable films are now available in the U.S. for all to enjoy. I was blown away by the creativity of Hiayo Miyazaki's first film and the famous actors they brought it in play the English voices. Unfortunatly I felt that the movie just dragged on a little too much. I don't think this will be a Studio Ghibli film I would own myself. Still, it is a movie that should be seen. You will be amazed at the specticle and grandure of this film and be very anxious to see what else Studio Ghibli has to offer a true film fan.

After seeing a film such as Ocean Waves (I Can Hear The Sea) I was really in the mood get back into the fantasy mode of Ghibli. Ocean Waves is a brilliant real story about 3 friends growing up together and experiencing life head on. It can be awkward and sometimes confusing, but in the end you learn to cope and move forward. *Ocean Waves is not up for release yet so that was my brief review)Then, we have 'Pom Poko'. It is the story of racoons with the ability to transform into many things from inatimate objects even human beings. In the late 1960s the racoons' home land is being dug up to make more room for new housing projects in Japan and the racoons have a war on their hands. The objective is to scare the humans into stopping production of these new houses and take what is theres. Through all the hardships and crazy parties the racoons soon reach the conclusion that in a constantly changing world they have to figure out ways to evolve with all their surroundings in order to remain alive.A fantasy directed by Isao Takahata, is something to be prepared for. Takahata has a gift of brining realism to life in his films and he does the same with this one eventhough it envolves such kooky characters as racoons. There are very funny moments but also moments that will make you cry or make you feel warm inside. The characters share amazing bonds and play off each other real well. Though I thought the plot was not as harsh as it turned to be the message is important.

As Ghibli rolls on becoming one of the biggest hits overseas after 'Princess Mononoke' it was time for something completly different. Isao Takahata takes the wheel with 'My Neighbors The Yamadas'. It's a simple story of your average family in peaceful suburbia. Takashi and Matsuko are a quirky couple trying to provide as best they can for their loathing teenaged son Nauboro their innocent daughter Nonoko and their slick mother living with them. They go through a series of events such as losing a family memeber at the mall to fighting over the remote control. Through all the arguements, and fast paced days this nutty family always manages to stay together not wanting to get at each others' throats.Isao Takahata is known for his realism in his directorial role, but this time he gets as real as it can possibly get. Though the animation is extremly cartoony and these characters have crazy imiginations, this film is all about the little moments that make up average family life. As you watch it you will pick out moments that you can sware happened in your neighbors or your friends or even your very own family! The english voices were perfect for each character. Jim Belushi and Molly Shannon are fantastic in the roles and they have such strong if not loopy chemistry in each scene they share. 'The Yamadas can be compared to the famous sitcom families with the events that take place and the antics involved. The movie is a bit slow, but the content really keeps you in your seat waiting to see what crazy adventure is next! It is also a landmark film for Takahata because he defineltly beleives life is not as fun without the laughs and this film keeps you smiling from begining to end.

I knew that as successful that the first Pirates was there was no doubt going to be a sequel in the works. So this time when the trailers were being released for 'Pirates Of The Carribean: Dead Man's Chest' I was eager to return to the theaters and get great for another wave crashing roller coaster.With a successful first time around this movie got the same actors but a much bigger budget so now it was time for the story to take a back seat and let the special effects have their day in the sun. First and foremost the movie was not bad, it still had the same writters and cast so the jokes and action were still at its peak. Also casting Bill Nighey as Davey Jones was a stroke of genius because he also like Geoffrey Rush can nail the fierce pirate persona. The only thing was there were some scenes where it just didn't make any sense and also the movie was much longer than the first so there were points where things were just being taken too over the top to the point where a person can rise up in a crowded theater and scream 'Enough already!'Once again with more plot twists and very shocking cliffhanger ending, wehn the credits start rolling you will still put your hands together and clap and be a little happier because now you know the final instalment is on the way and you will finally get your answers.

Lord of the Rings, the `Gone with the Wind' of the sci-fi fantasy film. The name of these 3 legendary novels has weaved itself deeply into our modern day culture. Whether you read `The Hobbit' in grade school or have read the Tolkien lore time and time again there is no doubt that this original saga is a treasure of that last century.Turning this epic novel saga into a full length feature film was something that probably every major name in directing wanted to do. Yet, Lord of the Rings may be the most difficult film saga to be created. The story is abundant with characters of all kinds. The plot is rich with detail and the pages of the book themselves describe everything from the way a person walks to a town or landscape down to the last grain of soil. So it was Peter Jackson who decided to rise up and take the task of creating this film. In a time where film making technology has reached a golden age it was time not just to make one film but make a trilogy. It was decided not to film each piece at a time but rather film all three simultaneously and it was something that Mr. Jackson could not accomplish alone. There is a long list of writers, artists, actors editors, and yes millions of fans that lead to the completion of this project. The Lord of the Rings can be summed up in one word. That word is PERFECT.I have seen a great many films in my life and my favorites would have to be the saga pieces. This saga is a mind blowing masterpiece and getting Oscar for best picture in 2003 sealed its page in the book of fantastic films. I will not review each film individually because they are not meant to be seen individually. The cast is brilliant and the fact that not a single actor was singled out for an individual performance only made it better. The creation of these films was a team effort. Yes there are a few major plot points removed from these films and there are some things that were changed around. I feel as a person who has read the novels and seen the films, feel that these changes were for the best. The books themselves have some dead spots that could be done without and there are characters that really have no place in the story as a whole, but it was very admirable of Jackson to pay homage to the fan favorite Tom Bombadil in the extended edition of `The Two Towers'. The extended editions of these films only make them better as they do make them lengthier. Jackson and the crew really wanted to make these films special so once they did their job in the theaters they called the cast and crew back to add new scenes and extend old ones to make the films truer to the story and enhance the development of the characters. The score done beautifully by Howard Shore is also extended and you can even purchase extended edition soundtracks. The special effects played a major role in this film and they worked the creatures looked extremely lifelike especially Gollum. By using a brand new kind of CGI technology called motion capture, Andy Sirkis was transformed into the somber, mysterious creature that LOTR fans love. The battle sequences in breathtaking and so intense there were moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. The ability to make actors like Elijah Wood and John Rys-Davis look like they were pint size compared to a towering Orlando Bloom or Ian McKellen was done flawlessly. The make-up on all the cast members be it Orc or Elf really brought the Tolkien world off the pages and into reality. Still, I feel that what truly made this film beautiful was the location. New Zealand is a lost world most of the country still untouched by industry. The land still looks like something out of a fairy tale. Through computers and sets, The Shire, Minas Tirith, Rivendell and all the other major cities were brought to life exactly as they are described in the novels.Even if you are not a fan, I would still suggest seeing these three films. It has nothing to do with the fact that they are fantasy or anything to that extent. It's just because this cinematic marvel goes up there with films such as Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, and Lawrence of Arabia to the more modern day greats like Dances With Wolves and Braveheart. There probably will come a day where a film graces the big screen with this degree of grandeur, but I am quite sure it will be a long time until then.

If there is one thing that can be said about television shows, the smart ones are the ones that no one ever watches. When the emmys roll around its those shows that get the most credit and when they are canned and released on DVD they make the most money.Boston Legal can only be summed up in one word...perfect. This show is a perfect blend of drama, suspence and comedy. The cases that are brought to the show every episode range from the topics that concern us every day all the way to some of the most bizzare that you never would beleive even existed in the real world. The best part about this show is the cast. This is a show that has brought famous names you probably haven't heard about in years. From Candice Bergen, Betty White the great William Shattner and James Spader who came out of no where! Each one gives a fantastic performance every time. The show also brings famous guest stars on to the show so there is never a dull moment.I am so excited to get this dvd because it is one of the few televison shows on today that really gets the crowd going and keeps you excited for the next episode. I just hope that after the second season we will be seeing more of this show for years to come.

Once I saw MAD magazine referring to The Strokes, The Vines, The White Stripes and The Hives as :The Attack of The Clones: I had to voice my own opinion where it can be heard. The White Stripes are in a category all their own. A true fan of rock music can appreciate this group. They may not be as talented as some acts on the scene, but then again most rock fans adore The Ramones. Listening to "White Blood Cells" is listening to a tribute to the lost sound of early '60's punk. From "Fell In Love With A Girl" (The Kinks) to "I Think I Smell A Rat" (The Who). The duo even shows its softer side with "We're Going To Be Friends" which sounds an awful lot like Paul McCartney's "Black Bird". Whether paying homage to the '60's or flat out originals like "Little Room" I would not be ashamed to call this album one of the best of 2002. As for the talk of clones, The White Stripes have already released two previous records while the other bands are just getting started. So with that I ask...who is copying whom?Again, notice that this is a lost review of mine from a previous username. This review was written in March of 2003, look at how far The White Stripes have come since this breakthrough release? Hmm...I guess I know my bands after all! ;-)

How could I possibly finish my reviews of Ranma 1/2 without mention the 12 OVA episodes that followed the show? These 12 episodes pick up right where we left off. Ranma and the gang are still growing together and getting into the usual...until these 12 episodes came along that is.These episodes truly stand alone from the origional TV series. For one the animation is brilliant and much more fluid that the TV show, but thats how it goes with the quality factor. What truly sets these 12 episodes up on the pedestil is the intensity that is brought with each incredible half hour. There isn't much room for cheap laughs here. There is everything from giant 7 headed dragons to baby phoenixes, enchanted murderous dolls and even a huge christmas party that has an ending that will make you want to hold that special someone close to you.Finally this is the moment in time where we get one step closer to the bond of Ranma and Akane at this stage in life Ranma lets the world and the viewers know exactly how he feels about Akane. So prepare for the action the laughs and yes the many tears that are shead as you watch the final 12 special adventures of Ranma 1/2. (Trust me you can skip the movies)*Recomended Episode: Tendo Christmas Scramble*

Disney brought us some of the greatest classic tales through the wonder of animation. In 1995 a group of young upstarts brought the world a ground breaking phenomenon. It was the very first animated film entirely done by the wizardry of computers. Still, there was something else that came with this movie, an incredible original and heartfelt story that touches billions of people. To this day this one simple movie has created a legacy that will live to infinity and beyond.'Toy Story', was a story unlike any other before its time. It was a creation that dived deep into our souls and brought out the inner child in all of us. Who ever thought that when the doors to our rooms are shut that our toys that we love come to life? Not only do they come to life but they have one mission and that is to keep whoever plays with them as happy as they possibly can. This tale also breaks the barrier of emotions and on the meaning of what it is to be a toy. What happens if one day a new toy comes along that is so much better than you? You might be replaced, thrown in a toy box and never see the light of day. And what happens when you get lost?! Well Toy Story shines the light on these tiny little things that you never would even think about when you put your toys away! These simple little things are what make 'Toy Story' the phenomenon that it is, but it also shows human beings themselves in a different way. Even the character that is set in this story to be a villain would never have realized that his acts were of a villainous nature, rather than just being a kid with certain interests. The voice acting is another thing that makes 'Toy Story' so great. Each actor breathes amazing life into their role. Each character is unique and the humor that is used in this film is so original and so fresh, but the best part is it is toy humor.This movie is probably one of the greatest movies ever, while compared to the Pixar films that followed a great deal has improved in the animation so this one would look just a bit crude. Unless you are a true film geek that likes to rag on the tiny details this is a film that you will never grow out of and to this day having seen this movie before I even got to high school it is still a movie that I treasure. It is in fact one of my favorite toys.

The action continues in the third season of Dragon Ball Z. This time Funimation was proud to bring the complete Frieza Saga together remastere, uncut and presented in widescreen. After Goku arrived on Namek, hanging by a thread from a deadly showdown with Caprain Ginyu things don't seem to get any better. Frieza realizing he was stalled from making his wish returns only to see Krillin, Gohan and Vegeta waiting for him. Vegeta boasting carelessly about how he has achieved legendary greatness of a Super Saiyan only brings on more pain suffering and death. In the blink of an eye Piccolo and Goku arrive in time but only to realize there is no way to stop the omnipitant Frieza. When things are at their blackest in a burst of uncontrolible rage it happens. The legenday golden haired Super Saiyan emerges in the form of the pure and innocent Goku.Sit back and get ready to be glued to your chair as the greatest battle in all of the Dragon Ball Series occures. I was very happy with how it was portrayed. There were definitely a few things that I don't remember from the original VHS tapes. I still remembered having to go to the store and spend 20 dollars a month waiting to complete the 10 tape saga. Now for pretty much the same price I get all 33 episodes in all their bloody glory. The only thing that was the sagas downfall is just having to sit through alot of pauses and flashbacks and an extremly long fight that in real time is only suppose to be five minutes.

The credits roll and the flagship scorlls across the screen nowadays I say to myself..."So begins the second chapter." With 'Revenge Of The Sith' marking the completion of the prequil trilogy 'Star Wars', now christened officially as 'A New Hope' makes so much more sense to me than ever before! I now know who Darth Vader is and where he came from and when he walks through the halls of the flagship for the very first time I now fear him because I truly know how evil he is.Darth Vader's fate now rests in the hands of three people. His old master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his twins Luke and Leia. This movie is the one that started it all back in 1977 introducing us to that Galaxy far far away. Now however everything that i see every charater, every bit of dialogue and ever planet makes so much more sense to me because of the fact the history has been told. But what makes this movie so good is the fact that the great Harrison Ford is in this film as the crafty smuggler Han Solo. Everything he says and does in this movie is just awesome. When you speak to the fans everyone's favorite scene is him pretending to be a storm trooper. I adore this movie so much more now thanks to episode 3, because after what is seen and done you just need that little bit of light back in your system. 'A New Hope' delivers on that account. Still, eventhough the rest of the story is something I can now recite with my eyes closed I now want to enjoy the rest of this story and watch what will unravel now that Luke knows he has to destory the Empire.

And so the epic tale of the galaxy far far away concludes with the well beloved happy ending. What can I say about this final chapter? The movie is great and acting is superb and the new ending is great.We now officially know the entire story and that the true main character is Anakin Skywalker and that he truly is the chosen one. When his own son Luke fights him and the Emperor steps in. Anakin finally realizes exactly where he belongs along side the forces of good as the most powerful Jedi ever. Alot of people tend to complain that the last three installments have been redone, but I don't understand why? Lucas was just trying to make them look as he envisioned them and the fans did get their Wookies in 'Revenge of the Sith'. Jabba's palace is always great (now even better knowing that Lucas left Leia the way she was in 1983)and there is nothing wrong with trying to prove that even the smallest of creatures like Ewoks can change the corse of history.Now has been told George Lucas did a smashing job as making one of the greatest stories ever to be put on film. Now hopefully he will rerelase the entire saga on the 30th anniversery year so we can all have an excuse to see them again.

Excited to go she comes across this big bustling city by the sea and encounters more than she bargened for. Not any monsters or evil sorcerers, but life.

She should be careful because when you grow up to might start to lose the things that you love. Only by creating the perfect balance can you truly live life to the fullest.'Kiki's Delivery Service' is such a delight. A perfect blend of story book fantasy and realism. The characters are so much fun to watch on screen especially Gigi the cat voiced in english by the late Phil Hartman. It's a family film that adults will like just as much as kids. I don't know what it is about Hayao Miyazaki, but he always knows how to deliver a great time with his films.

After his very first venture out into the world, the young Goku is eager to get back out and explore. Goku is on the hunt for just one of the seven Dragon Balls, but he is not the only one. Now, Goku is about to face his toughest challenge, the evil Red Ribbon Army. These men are fierce and mean serious business. They will do whatever it takes to get the Dragon Balls for their leader, Commander Red. With the help of some old friends and some brave new ones Goku is going to make sure that the beautiful planet that he has just started to see will not be painted red with the bllod of the innocent.As a fan of Dragon Ball Z, I am loving every episode of Dragon Ball. I love how the story is much simpler and so much more fun. It is amazing to watch Goku grow up into the noble warrior that he is in DBZ and now it is great to finally see how all of his friends are thrown into the story. The best part about DB is because the story is so much smaller all the characters that didn't get so much development in DBZ are getting their much deserved time in this series. Master Roshi, The Ox King and yes even Oolong have so much more importance in this piece of the story and it just makes me so happy to see it. What I do know is as the story moves towards the DBZ sagas the story of Dragon Ball will get darker, but for now like Goku in the first and now second season I am just having fun.

If you have seen my reviews on the past two seasons then you really don't need to read this. If you want to see you all your favorite toys and nostalgic posessions make fun of current events pop culture and hump one another. First buy the first two seasons watch, love and laugh and pick up season 3. It only gets better with season 3. Oh yes, the famous question 'where do I go from here?' need not apply with Robot Chicken.

The Killers were only the first to truly show that the 80's sound of new wave music was still alive. Unfortunatly the mainstreem is not giving it credit. Lets face it its about hip-pop, Depressing emo punk and extremly attractive song writters that make pre-teen girls squirm. Let me be frank the music mainstream sucks all rap music post 1996 sucks and who wants to listen to music that makes you depressed angry or put you to sleep?The Bravery is a fantastic cd from start to finish its a feel good cd you can blast in your car and even dance to. Each track is a good listen and there are very few albums i say i have to listen to strait through. I think its one of the best cds to come out in a while since there hasnt been much. Will this music ever become popular probably not but as long as there is a fan base and good music coming out from bands such as these no radio play is a good thing because then the bands will be considered timeless and not butchered.

For the record I had never read any Tintin comic strips at all before I went to see this film. All I knew was that he was a very popular comic character from the 1950s-1960s. So without any prior knowledge I still felt that this was one of the themost enjoyable animated films in 2011.You have two of the best directors of the past 30 years, two incredible young script writters and a cast for the ages. The 'Adventures of TinTin' is just a rolercoaster of excitement and pefect blend of adventure and comedy. You do not need to be a Tintin purest to enjoy this one. I just hope there are sequils because I really loved it.

With Goku still not back from Namek it is time for evil doers to run rampant all over Earth. The only thing they didn't count on was that fact that there are others out there just as strong as Goku. In Dragon Ball Z season 4 we witness the calm before the next big storm. It is up to Krillin, Piccolo, Vegita and Goku's son Gohan to stop the badies such as Garlic Jr. and the Spice Boys from taking over Kame's lookout tower. It is up to a strange new commer Trunks to welcome the suriving Frieza and his Dad and to prevent them from destroying the Earth.Now there is a bigger threat looming in the shaddows and now with Goku on his way home Earths special forces are going to need to train long and hard so when the next menace arrives they will be ready.I agree with all the other people that have reviewed this season. These three sagas following the Frieza saga are just fillers for a break in the action from the next big menacing force, but if you think about it that's how it has been since season 1! First came Vegita then a break then Frieza and now another break. So whenever this new menace comes around (I know who it is but I would rather be respectable to all the first time watchers of DBZ)there will obviously be another break in the action once the next major villian is put to rest.

As a huge Beatles fan since the age of 5 seeing the trailer for this movie was a very big thing. Not that many people have the audacity to bring the Musical to the big screen anymore, especially if the story is not based on a broadway musical. 'Acorss The Universe' is the story of an English bloke named Jude (from Liverpool no surprise) heading to America in the 60s to find his estranged father. No sooner that he get there he is swept up into the whole revolution that was America at that time. A wild and fun loving guy named Max and his sheltered younger sister Lucy guide him through this crazy time through travel, drugs, politics and of course song.While the movie was creative and being a Beatles fan it is something to see, I felt that the movie was just a little overhyped. I felt there were plenty of unanswered questions due to plot holes. There wasn't enough character development. While the story was very well thought out I felt that the movie was more focused on the music leaving the plot very shallow. Yes it is true that the point of the movie was for the songs to tell the story, as a person that loves film I just don't like that concept. I like to get involved and think about the stories, not just get lost in a visual specticle. Still, the linking of Beatles knowledge and 1960's pop culture references was pretty much what kept me interested in sticking around from start to finish.Did I hate this movie...no I found it origional and entertaining. I loved the guest appreaences of faces like Bono and Eddie Izzard. I loved the refernces to alot of secondary Beatles songs. I just feel that it was a story that could have been developed so much more if the movie was not focused on the songs. I have seen many musicals in my days. 'The Music Man', 'The Sound Of Music' and oh hell 'South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut'. They are had songs driving the movie, but at the same time a fantastic story that made you love it when the credits rolled. Still any Beatles fan out there should take the time to see 'Across The Universe'. You will be glad you did.

There are many reasons for people to experience the world of Anime, but none so important than Studio Ghibli's 'Grave of the Fireflies.' This Studio Ghibli film is not directed by Hayao Miyazaki, but rather the other major brainchild of Ghibli Isao Takahada. Both geniuses of their genre, but very different. When you see such a film as 'Grave of the Fireflies' you will catch the differnece instantly.This film tells the story of an orphaned brother and sister during the air raides on World War 2 Japan and their extremly loving bond as they went through numerous hardships of angry family members to struggling to survive. This film is so rich emotion it made me burst into tears just seeing how real these animated characters were and how much love was in their hearts. You just don't get this kind of emotion from any other animated film nor do you see it in any film in general.This movie was praised by critics and film goers worldwide as probably the greatest film of all time. If not that than a very important one that should be seen. What Takahada brings to the Ghibli line-up is real human intrest in real life situations that tugs at your heartstrings. I swear that once the credits role you will just sit there awestruck at what you just experienced. I did.

Since 'Iron Mans' 2008 release we the fans have been eagerly awaiting the assembly of one of the greatest Super-Hero forces in comic history. Not just as a treat for fans, but as a pioneering film uniting various individual film stars in a union that has never been done in film. IT WORKED!'The Avengers' is such an incredible and fun film. Each character is given just enough time to shine and everything from the battle sequences to the jokes had perfection written all over it. Mark Ruffalo taking Edward Nortons' spot as Bruce Banner, was the biggest thing for me to see because it was a pretty big role to fill. It was as if Norton had never been there in the first place. Mark Ruffalo was one of the best additions to this film saga and don't get me started on how Hulk was in the movie. The part that I loved most about this film was the ending, because you are left knowing that this story is far from finished and it is going to be bigger and better.'The Avengers' is of course going to be compared to 'The Dark Knight Rises' as to which was the better film. There is no comparison they are two different movies, but as great as Dark Knight was, The Avengers was just so much more from a pure entertainment perspective. If you missed this movie on the big screen, shame on you. Still, the movie is worth getting, I know I will watch it over and over again.(End of Book 1)

In the history of animation all the way until today Disney has shined above the rest with the brining to life of classic stories. While there are other companies out there that try to succeed most of them seem to fade into the background. 'An American Tale', 'The Land Before Time' and 'The Iron Giant' are just a few.In 1988 in the peak of American animation Miyazaki created 'My Neighbor Totoro'. It is the story of two sisters that move into a new house that they feel is being watched by spirits. Being the adventurous girls they are, they find that there is a something there and it's big! Once they find it an incredible world of wonderous adventures begin and their lives will never be the same.' My Neighbor Totoro' was such a wonderful film. I was captivated by the complexity of the characters in such a simple story. It really stands up there along with some of the great Dinsey classics, which is no surprise that Disney got their hands on it. Still, in my opinion try and get your hands on the origional english dubbed film from Fox family animation. The voices are much better especially with Cheryl Chase (voice of Rugrats Angelica) as the voice of the adorable and spunky Mae. You will laugh until it hurts and just stare in amazment of all the fantastic moments that will captivate you in this adorable family film. It will probably end up on your top 10 list if you're not careful.

So after all the crazy antics. All the gender/speices tranformations, the crazy martial arts tournaments and everything else under the sun it all comes down to the seventh and final season of Ranma 1/2.This season does the series justice by giving its fans a season to remember and most importantly closure. The seventh season combines all the highs (no lows here!) of the past six seasons. The show throws in one more crazy race one more contest for a feast and all the famed side characters we have met along the way. From Picolei, to the Frog Hermit. Dr. Tofu to Colonge, the gang is all here! There is also an end to Ranma's three crazy ladies and his three arch nemesis. Still what makes this season so fantastic is the series two part finale where Ranma's mother finally arrives with a secret that dives deep into Ranma's past. You will learn the whole story that brought Ranma and his father to where they are today and the other shocker that shows us why Ranma can't go back home.Still, why would you want a show to do that. We must never dwell on the past we must only look forward and eventhough the final episode never gives us a true window towards Ranma's future you can see in his eyes that he truly has gain alot from the past 7 years. A sharp mind, and pure soul and yes true love for Akane.(Thanks for reading!)*Recomended Episode: Instruments of Destruction*

What happens when a bunch of gophers in the cartoon network studio take the worst known cartoon ever created and re-do the voices to make it weird and funny? Why you get one of the greatest cult classics of television of the 21st Century, Sealab 2021.Sealab 2021, is the epic adventures of Sealab's fearless leader Captain Murphy and his wild and crazy crew. These brave men and women encouter everything from dangerous sea creatures, cute multiplying gloop babies, menacing grief counselars and yes the worst of all...tourists! Every episode will make you ball up on the floor with laughter if you are into nothing but spontanious occurances and extremly stupid one liners. Unfortunatly the show was cut short after the fourth season ended mostly due to the sudden death of Harry Goz the voice of Murphy. Eventhough the crew tried valliantly to keep the show going with Goz's son Michael doing the voice of the nutty Tornato Shanks, and of course more Hesh and Dolphin Boy time.Still the show remains a favorite in the liniage of the now ever popular adult animation block. Each season is bizzare yet exciting ride that will leave you quoting things like Squishface and Alvis. This treasure is not to be over looked, enjoy the nutty sensation!*Recomended Episodes:Season 1: StimutaxSeason 2: Hail SquishfaceSeason 3: Red DawnSeason 4: Joy of Grief

In the post grunge era of the late 90's right before the explosion of pop and mainstreem hip-hop there was one band that didn't want to let go of the glory days of the first half of the decade. That band was Garbage. Garbage combined haunting Annie Lennox like vocals from the stunning Shirley Manson hard tuned down guitar rifts and just a pinch of slight new wave and created one easily recognizible sound for the time. I was eagerly awaiting this grestest hits and the best part is this special edition with a whole addition cd of remixes. The best part about the remix cd is that its not all the same songs as on the first disc. So pretty much all of the songs of Garbage that I loved are all here so I got my moneys worth entirely. If you are a fan of this band it is a worthy addition to your collection if you are looking for something different or trying to get into the band more its a great starter.

The Justice League has done it all in the DCAU. Saved the world from alien attacks, saved other worlds in need of help and even saved themselves from the people they have sworn to protect. Now, they face something new. What would you say if you suddenly visited by your arch enemy claming he is from another dimension, and in his world he is a good guy?! Well, in Bruce Timms newest DCAU film, `Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths' Superman, Batman and the other JL members will find out.The whole `Crisis' Story line has a grand history in the world of DC comics. From the Silver Age all the way to the mid 1980s there was a great deal of confusion around the story arcs of the heroes we have grown to love. DC had a great answer, let's bring all these arcs together, say they are all from different Earths in different dimension and kill as many characters as we can. The `Crisis' story in this film is actually one of the very first that has been re-visited a few times in the past 25 years, and for a 78 minute movie it is also one of the simplest to follow. That is a big plus for fans of the DCAU who might not be knowledgeable on the Crisis Lore. So the JL are visited by a good Lex Luthor who tells them about a world where the super powered men and women just happen to be the bad guys and what is worse, they like to kill. They are pretty much the JL through a broken mirror and Lex has no choice but to bring the good guys from another world to his to win the day.I have been a fan of the DCAU for a while and so far I have enjoyed all the Warner Premiere films they have given us. Crisis was a fun movie to watch. While the character development was nowhere in sight it was a blast. I think that this film was made more for the comic fan. You know your characters you know the Crisis lore, just sit back and enjoy. What character development they did show in this film was done very well. Martian Manhunter had a great role to play, while he was not part of a great deal of the action. The voice acting was top notch. It was a little discomforting at first to hear Batman with a slightly higher pitch than normal, but the Batman persona was still there and at times he even made me laugh. Mark Harmon was great as Superman and Gina Torres was deliciously evil as Superwoman. Still, by far the best acting came from James Woods. Owlman was a villain that kept everything low pitched and emotionless. That is the kind of villain that becomes very frightening because the mystery leads to extreme unpredictability.DC fans are gonna love this film, especially with all the surprises that are thrown in. You are going to see a few additional familiar faces and a few new faces that are going to make you love it even more. This one made me very happy because it was taken from a story I wanted to see brought to the DCAU and the next film, is based upon the aftermath of `Death In The Family', another story I wanted to see. Take the time to see this movie, and make sure you see the two disc addition so you are able to see the DC Showcase short of `The Spectre'

I wish I could rate this DVD higher than five stars, because a show like `Justice League' goes far beyond any television show and I am not just referring to cartoons. The masters of comic book animation, Bruce Timm and company put their heads together and said..."Hey Batman and Superman worked, lets make a new show with more heroes in it." `Justice League is nothing like The Superfriends of the `70's. It is a dramatic action packed masterpiece.The high point of this DVD is that expands the DC universe. For me, being mostly a Marvel comic reader, this show really got me familiar with the DC universe and I love it. There are some loyal fans that are disappointed with the fact this animated team is not composed of the original seven:SupermanBatmanWonder WomanAqua ManThe FlashMartian Man-hunterGreen LanternPlease, when has Bruce Timm and company disappointed us? The first season fills all the gaps with a great Aqua Man story. Hawkgirl is great for the show because she has a wild side that really gives Wonder Woman a run for her money. And what does more heroes mean?...Why more villains of course! The episode `Injustice for All' is my favorite episode of this first season, because it really sets the stage for what is yet to come in the next few seasons. I am not going to reveal anything, but all I can say is you will not be disappointed.Justice League is a must have for hard-core comic readers to fans of `Batman: The Animated series. It has surely stood the test of time being that it is in the middle of its 5th season and it just might be the best show on Television.

Bruce Timm and his staff have done it again! A show based on the glory days of the original animated series that has become a staple in the hearts of loyal comic book and animation fans. `Batman Beyond' is all the greatness of the original animated heightened ten fold. It's got a heavier dose of speed, grit and action that will throw you right out of your seat. The villains are twice as vicious and armed to the teeth with the coolest powers and weaponry. The stories are well written and the actors chosen for the character voices are great. I still find it hard to beleive that the voice of the new Batman is Eric Matthews from 'Boy Meets World'.The first season of Batman Beyond is a true masterpiece. Even though it's not the same Batman, I guarantee you won't even miss the cape.

Superman is one of the most recognizable icons in the world today. He has many adoring fans of all his media. He has been seen in comic books television and films and heard through radio serials and word of mouth. In the mid 1990s Bruce Timm, after much success with his animated series of Batman, decided to move his talents to Superman. What he gave us was a true strait off the page Superman that was yet to be seen in visual media. This was a Superman that showed weaknesses just as deep as his strengths. His ability to care as well as his ability to slug it out with super natural threats. Most importantly this was a Superman that the fans have wanted to see brought to life Still, over time this vision remained in the shadow of its film counterpart which lacked his characteristics we still had yet to see that were as authentic as Bruce Timm's vision.Bruce Timm's DCAU film projects have featured Superman doing what he does best, saving humanity and punishing evil. Now we have the newest film `All Star Superman'. This was a film I was eager to see much like all the others, but what I got was something I never would have expected. I was aware of the plot and aware of the films basis, but this was the first time I have ever seen a specific side of the Man of Steel . That was a side of his I always knew was there, but this film brought it right out into the open and that is the Man of Steel's heart of gold. This film is very different from all the other films as a matter of fact, it is a work of art. The film touches on Superman's want to love and care for others. In the moments where he feels the most vulnerable are the moments he wears his heart on his sleeve for all to see. We see his relationship to Lois taken to brand new heights, his caring for his parents and even the urge to save the fallen like his arch nemesis Lex Luthor. Of course we are not without some amazing battles, but even in the bloodshed there is a deep emotion thrown into every punch that Superman throws. The voice cast for this film is amazing. While so many want the regular voices of the DCAU greats, they are not always perfect for the films. Anthony LaPaglia was a perfect Luthor for this film because he was able to show a heartless Lex as well as one who seeks redemption. Christina Hendricks brings a brand new spunk to Lois with her perfect comedic timing as well as her most vulnerable of moments. James Denton could not have been a more perfect Superman for this project. He gave his all to bring out the Superman you see in this film. He gave Superman a heart and made this Superman so real and that is why I think I enjoyed this film.There was a lot of negative feedback about this film so far, but I think it's because in order to love this film, you need to have a true love for Superman. You have to remember all the major factors that made him who he is from his origin story to the legendary quote "Look...up in the sky!" You have to have know, not just the names Clark Kent or Lois Lane, but Christopher Reeve, George Reeves and Teri Hatcher. This is a movie that will lift you possibly make you cry, and make you feel emotions of love, loss and hope. 'All Star Superman', is a film that we Superman fans have secretly been waiting for, because it shows us fans of the DCAU and its creators that there is so much more than can be brought to a superhero besides the powers and flashy costumes. Because under the mask and the symbol, we all share the most important similarity of all, we are all human.Also this was a perfect final project for DCAU writer Dwayne McDuffie who passed away one day after this DVD release. He gave us some of the DCAUs best work and this is couldn't be a better send off.

Bruce Timm and company just keep cranking out the hits. Ever since BTAS, I have just been overwhelmed, by everything that these guys have done. One of things that I love about the DCAU, is that while have been given great stories about Batman and Superman and the other big name DC heroes, they always remember the little guy.DC Showcase is a collection of short films that revolve around `other' heroes in the DC universe and give us a story about how they do what they do to keep truth and justice. Three of these shorts have already been given to us in the last 3 DCAU DVD releases, but it is still nice to get them in their own package. Of course the main attraction is the title, `Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam' Captain Marvel isn't what one would call a less popular hero, in fact he is extremely popular. Still, the DCAU has not really given him the screen time he deserves. After the JLU episode `Clash' I was so happy to finally see Captain Marvel as part of the DCAU, now he gets his own origin story. The short is about the length of an actual tv episode and it is great to see Superman witness the creation of Captain Marvel. Brining back George Newbern and Jerry O'Connell to voice their respective characters was awesome, because like in `Clash the two actors work off each other so well. Arnold Vosloo brings a great persona to Black Adam and just having Black Adam in general in the short is great as well, because like Captain Marvel he is another character that never really has been given much time in the spotlight.Along with this new short there are extended versions of the first three shorts. You barley notice the changes, but they do seem longer with a lot less broken dialogue so the flow is much better. `The Spectre', is perhaps my favorite because it uses the old 1970s film scratch effects to make it come off an old cartoon. The casting of Gary Cole to voice The Spectre was pure genius, as he is probably one of the best character actors out there today. It's a great story of revenge and mystery and it works well from beginning to end. `Green Arrow' is the most modern of the shorts. Casting Neil Mcdonugh and Malcom McDowell is a real one two punch. It is a great Green Arrow story of him doing what he does best. It's got great action sequences and witty humor and throwing a little surprise in at the end is just the icing on the cake. The final short is `Jonah Hex' and its style is a true western. The animation is very brown and earthy like the westerns of old, so the vibe is there. You have a great cast in Thomas Jane, Linda Hamilton and Michelle Tractenberg. It's a very slow story more plot driven than action driven, though the action sequences are great. It definitely makes up for the bust that the actual film was.The only negative that I have about the package in general is that there were not enough short films. It would have been great to see at least 6 Showcase shorts because there are so many characters that still have yet to be Showcased. While this installment is a tremendous success I really hope that this is the first of many more installments to come.End of Book 2

I was very curious to see this chapter of history. The story of the 11 Israeli athletes getting killed by Palestinian terrorists and the story that followed. I feel the actors chosen to play the characters couldn't have been better and the movie itself was incredible. However I feel the message that was sent to the movie going public was the incorrect one. (Caution: when I say incorrect I don't mean untrue)Right now we are living in a very controversial time where the situation in the Middle East is a very sensitive subject. I am one who wants to see peace, but with the violence escalating every day we are far from reaching that goal. What people need to understand is that only one side wants peace and unfortunately `Munich' did not elaborate on that enough. The Israeli task force is depicted to be just as uncaring as the Palestinian extremist groups in this movie. (Never do they show actual Palastinans that truly want peace). In the beginning the message is to kill the plotters of the Munich murders and in the end the Israelis are leaving bodies uncovered in shame and the main character gives up his love for his homeland. The scene where Eric Bana's character sees himself fighting along side the terrorists is an absolute disgrace. The pieces of the movie that should have been elaborated more were the people they were killing. These were Palestinian officials high in power living far away from the Palestinian hostage camps in lavish mansions and accepting money from all different governments just to keep the violence going. Those are actual living breathing people in the P.L.O. that are still alive today. The should have made it more clear that the mission was to kill the terrorists and not to hurt the innocent Palestinians like the women and children as well as Palestinian men that had nothing to do with assassinating Jewish people.Is this movie good...yes it is a brilliant film worthy of its credit. Will is be nominated for awards...absolutely. I don't think that Spielberg displayed anything untrue in this movie. He did however show more sympathy towards the wrong side. I believe his message was to say he wants peace and the only way to show that was that both sides shedding blood constantly would only make it worse and there never will be peace. I feel there is nothing wrong with showing there are two sides fighting and only one side wants peace. If the world can understand that there are certain people (not a nation) that don't then the true evils in this world will be wiped out and there finally will be peace.

What is Animusic? If you are thinking of `Fantasia' I will stop you right there. Animusic is computer-animated music and it is something any fan of music or animation or any form of art for that matter can enjoy. This is how music itself if portrayed as animated backgrounds, settings and instruments. This one of those DVD's you can't pull away from, otherwise you are going to miss something pretty cool (NOTE: Don't even think of blinking while watching `Pipe Dream'). There are 7 tracks each unique in its own sound and style, so there is something for everyone. From rock, to jazz to acoustic `Animusic' is sheer bliss. When I first saw it was simply amazed. The music is great the sequences are a great spectacle and even though there are no vocals some of the "characters" really leave an impression. If you are looking for something unique I highly recommend this DVD. It is a real treat for the senses.

The world of `Twilight' has become a phenomenon. Like other fantasy/romance novels this story has brought the world of Vampires to a whole new generation. Unfortunately, while it is having a positive impact not everyone will agree.The second installment of the `Twilight' saga, `New Moon' expands the world and romance of Bella and Edward (The Emo Vampire) Bella now suffers the pain of losing the man she loves, because he feels his world is too dangerous for her. Now, that someone has exposed Edward as Vampires a tribe of Werewolves has appeared and apparently there is a treaty between the two races to make sure that things are kept in a safe balance. The scale is now starting to tip because Bella's best friend Jacob Black is a Werewolf, and he wants Bella to be more than just a friend. You just have to love those bizarre love triangle stories.Now, the first movie I have to admit was not good. The special effects were something out of a CW drama, the acting was bland and the story itself was just way too emo for me. Surely there would be some improvements in those departments, especially with a bigger budget. `New Moon' just reeks with failure; you need a mop and bucket to clean it all up. I would love to point out a few good points, but since there are more bad than good we will save them to play redeeming qualities. First of all the script...it was as if it was written by a first grade English class. The dialogue was so cheesy and pathetic I was throwing up inside of my mouth at points. Look, I do appreciate romance in a film, but when you put no efforts in to the romance especially by using such horrible actors to portray it just doesn't come off as believable. The acting was horrible, the people chosen to play these characters apparently felt there was no reason to even look back at the first film and work out the kinks. The roles were either overacted or under acted there was no in between at all. The only thing they improved was the lighting on Kristen Stewart so she didn't look like someone dumped a whole pouch of flower on her head. Stewart just doesn't know how to be emotional, she can't even cry and make it look believable. Robert Pattenson.....you know...I can't say anything. He should just be thanking whatever God he has faith in that he will be able to live of this money for the next 10 years. Now, Ana Kendrick...I like her and I think she was fantastic in `Up In The Air' She was cast all wrong, because she is not a girly girl. She would have been a much better choice for Bella than Stewart because she probably would have been able to do a much better acting job. Taylor Lautner...let's face it he is just there for his body. The tweens just went to see him take his shirt off. Also they couldn't even improve on the special effects. Now that there are werewolves in the film you think they could make them look a little more real. Well, I have to say the wolves looked pretty life like but the transformation looked cartoonish. Take a look at a film like `The Incredible Hulk' Edward Nortans transformation looked much more real and believable than these werewolves. Now here is the part that really pissed me off. The plot of this movie is so weak and it really didn't go anywhere. Throughout the movie I was just waiting for something to happen...no climactic action sequence so major turning point in the story nothing. The whole movie was just Bella crying and trying to kill herself to a very, very emo soundtrack. The finally when the turning point finally shows its face (A very weak and predictable one I might add) the movie stops!!! So basically I just sat through a bunch of jumbled plot points with no development only to be told sorry now you have to watch the next movie! Ok, the good parts about this movie were two things. Dakota Fanning and Michael Sheen did a fantastic acting job and Dakota finally put that creepy face of hers to good use. Michael Sheen came of as a very creepy character with excellent use of dialogue. They should have expanded on these characters a little more because even though I know they will show up in the further installments some more development would be essential.Again, I saw this movie for free so it wasn't such a loss. Just my time was taken away, and I guess that is my fault to a degree because I didn't have to sit through it. But, the real reason that I saw it was just to see if maybe just maybe a good movie could have been created here. Since it was a failed attempt I got to write this review...that was the best part of all.

There are many films that show the story of young adults looking into their past to find the answers, but in America it's always wrapped in crude comedy or things that are so big you can't relate them to the real world. Isao Takahada and Studio Ghibli think otherwise with the film 'Only Yesterday'Taeko, is a 27 year old girl working to be successful, but never really seeming to find the time to slow down and really figure out what she wants in life. Her only escape is her family out in the country where she is one with nature and is able to clear her mind. This time her trip is different as she suddenly gets a rush of memories of herself as a 10 year old. As a little girl she remembers her first vacation to a hot springs resort and how the granduer made everything just click. When she comes back to the city life just seems to move so fast, she just can't keep up. When she comes back to today and is about to leave the countryside, she suddenly realizes what she has to do to be happy.This is a very unique movie. It's what my friend calls a Human Intrest Film. I did enjoy the movie because of it's complexity and the characters, but I did have some trouble just following the purpose of the story. It could have been the fact that this is one of the few Studio Ghibli movies that has not been released in the states in english just yet. It is not a family film considering some of the topics that are discussed, but it's tame enough to show your young tween, because there are life lessons that can be taken from the many flashbacks in the film. It is a very real movie and unfortauntly movies like those are some that people don't always understand. That is why I rated it 3 out of 5 stars. Not because it's a bad movie, but be cause it may not be something everyone will relate to. Still, it was very well done and something people should see if they are looking for something origional and new. That is something Studio Ghibli knows best.

We all know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but could there have possibly been something more? The answer couldn't have been more inovative and flat out hillarious than 'Hoodwinked'. This fairy tale is turned into a classic 'Who Done It?' mystery as the police of the enchanted woods try to find out who is swiping sweets recepies. Red, The Wolf, the Woodsman and yes even Granny are all suspectes caught up in it.What amazed me about this movie was it was a very short story entirly, but it was told in 4 different ways. Each 'suspect' was doing a completly different thing and all four came together in the end. Each story was origional and funny and that's what made me enjoy it so much. The characters were voiced to perfection and the songs would put a smile on anyones face.This movie really came out of nowhere and even became the top grosser in it's opening week. If you are up for a fun time at the movies 'Hoodwinked' will not disappoint.

The long awaited `Avengers' project moves forward once more, this time bringing a whole new dimension to the Marvel Universe. From the heavens of Norse legend, comes `Thor'. The God of Thunder awaiting to become the omnipotent leader of the 7 realms is cast out due to his selfishness and left powerless on the planet of Earth. There he has to understand that there is much more to being a God than just sitting on your thrown and getting your way.For a film that is build around so much grandeur than the past few films linked to this story, I was impressed with how grounded it was. Amongst the action there is excellent character development from a well assembled cast. Chris Hemsworth is truly Thor and the way he portrays the boastfulness is fantastic. Natalie Portman always does a great job and with every new role she brings something different. Tom Hiddleson was a perfect Loki, unknowns always seem to the best when it comes to breakthrough performances. The thing that I loved the most about this film was the fact that it was so relatable and funny. There are some moments that just had me laughing. Kat Dennings while she really doesn't have a significant character has some of the best comic timing in the film and that is what makes her character relevant.`Thor' is a winner and it was one of the best films that I saw this summer and all the surprises that are thrown into this movie just make me more excited for the day The Avengers assemble.

So it is official Tony Stark is Iron Man and he has been given quite a task. What kind of a hero is he going to be and will he destroy himself in the process.This movie of course is only a small portion of what is on the way and now it is no longer a secret. In this movie Iron Man is being taken on by villains and heroes alike. There is a new villain out there who apparently had some connections with Tony's dad wants revenge. Because of his extra fame as an industrialist and a super-hero Nick Fury is trying to make sure that he doesn't get out of control even if it means taking him off the roster of the Avengers.I really can't figure out how to put this review together because that is pretty much what the movie was like. It was a great deal of fun, but it was very much reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock. Just throw your characters to the canvas and hopefully a story will pop out of it. Well thankfully the humor and the great action sequences were able to keep the crowd interested and the movie did make quite a large amount in the box office. Still, in my opinion Marvel has to keep their heads on strait and stick to the plan ahead. There is a monster movie franchise brewing here and if they keep putting together movies like Iron Man 2 people will get very skeptical about the future projects.

For me nothing facinates me more than world history. Being able to see some of the greatest moments in time in a movie setting is nothing but remarkable. Still, there are so many chapters of history that were overshadowed by the 'main event' that they are lost. Film has really given these lost stories a chance to resurface and be shown to the movie going public. Valkyrie is one of those stories.World War II is one of the most talked about periods of history, but this film shows the story within. During the reign of Hitler in Nazi Germany no one would ever have guessed there were actually high Nazi officials with a heart who knew that what was happening was evil. Led by a decorated soldier who escaped death, these officers fearing their own demise carefully craft a plan to take out the furer and stop what they already knew would be a losing battle.I felt that the movie was good for what it was. Bryan Singer tried to tell a story of consipiracy and good will with a good cast backing it up. I am not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise, but I was pretty impressed by the origionallity of his performance. The story moves pretty slow in the begining, but normally stories such as these will. I wasn't expecting this to be an award winning film, but it was an entertaining one. I would recommend it to be seen at least once, just to see the truth that not all the Nazi officials were truly evil.

In a time when our world changing far too quickly, there is always a film that comes along to define the sign of the times. This time George Clooney takes us into the mind of a man who just flat out hates being around people and involved with their lives. Guess what he does for a living? He has to fire people from their jobs and connect with them in order to motivate them to find a new opportunity. So now what do you do when your line of work is telling you have to stop avoiding all connections and stay grounded? That is what the film `Up In The Air' is all about.I knew that there was a huge buzz about this movie and I have to say I got a lot more than I expected out of this movie. First of all the cast is crazy amazing. Everyone from Clooney to Kendrick plays their roles unbelievably well. Anna Kendrick was of course my favorite, just because I was in her exact position not too long ago. I remember learning the tricks of the trade in my line of work and traveling to sit down with prospects. I remember sitting in a car almost crying because I found the job to be too much or just wondering if I was going to able to do this on my own for a living. What I loved about the film the most was how it depicted how distant we are becoming as a creature. How we break up with our significant others over a text message or that we can't sit face to face in the room with someone when we have to give them negative news. It shows that it turns us into soulless and spineless people. Whether you would agree with my views or not...that was what I got out of this film. Understand that this film can depress you at points, but it is a comedy and it has some great laughable moments and yes you do get a nice ending.This is a movie that I recommend you see at least once, because it just a story about ordinary people trying to live the lives they want to live. That is something we as individuals do every day. The question is what makes you stand out amongst the others.

I have always had a soft spot for the Ninja Turtles and I loved the two live action films....yes there were only two! So I was very excited to see the new CGI TMNT, but the horde of terrible reviews came so fast it made my head spin. I finally got a chance to catch this movie on HBO and FORSHAME ON ALL OF YOU WHO HATED THIS MOVIE!!!This was a great story with a great cast of characters. The story takes place after Shredder and the Turtles are not actually teenagers anymore. The story has a lot of emotion and great dilogue between the turtles even an excellent falling out with Leo and Raph that just left me awestruck. Making this an animated film was the right way to go because the action sequences were mind blowing. This was just a great way to lose myself in fantasy for a good hour and a half. As far as I am concerned I don't think anyone should have a problem with this movie and if you did you probably never liked TMNT when you were kid and I feel sorry for you.

The world of vampires in film has been forever stained since the release of the Twilight series. The world of vampires no longer includes action and just plain coolness. However while Dark Shadows is not one of the grand vamp films of old Tim Burton still manages to give me something that makes me smile.Dark Shadows is not a great film, but if you enjoy Tim Burton films and all his wacky characters then this is a film you will find fun, very witty and just Tim Burtony. Johnny Depp, Michelle Phiepher and the rest of the cast deliver and Chloe Mortez along with Eva Green definitely shine in this one. It's got a few strong links to the old television show, but it really is Tim Burtons' own take and he just does what he does best.

Reality TV has pretty much taken over the airwaves so it is time to bite back with Drawn Together. This is an animated reality show putting 8 different cartoon characters in a house and seeing what happens. What happens you ask? It can all be summed up in one word...&lt;CENSORED>.I would love to tell you what this show is all about, but I have a feeling that it won't be able to get published on this site. What I can tell you is this is the show that reality tv fans will love and reality tv haters will love even more! This show pretty much crosses the line on everything that is good and pure in this world. It is rauncher than Jackass, grosser that Fear Factor, goofier than Flavor of Love and pretty much more amazing than anything you will ever see on television. Each joke makes you laugh until your sides hurt, the uncensored verson on these dvds will shock you so much your jaw will drop all the way down to the Earths core. The pop culture references of television, reality television and various animation companies will make laugh so hard you will do things I can't even say on this web site. What I can say is this is a must see show for anyone from super avengelical to devil worshipers. Get all three seasons in all their gut busting and gut wrenching glory, beleive me it is so worth it! On that note so will the movie!*Recomended Episodes*Hot Tub/Pilot - Season 1Foxxy VS. The Board Of Education - Season 2Drawn Together Babies - Season 3

When I saw the trailer for Legend of the Guardians , I was so excited to see it. One of the main reasons was because it was directed by Zack Snyder and because the animation looked unlike anything I have ever seen in CGI. I finally got to the theaters to see it and I have to say that was let down.First off, the animation was the best part of the whole film. I could not get over how breathtaking the landscapes were and even the way the characters were brought to life. These owls looked so lifelike and while they did talk and fight (yes they actually fought with blades), the way they walked and the way their feathers and wings went against the wind was astounding. The acting was very well done, getting a slew of well known names such as Jim Sturgess, Sam Neil, Hugo Weaving and Abigail Cornish. The only weakness this film had was the plot. I understand that the film was in fact the first 3 novels of this massive story. The reason it failed was because the film was way too short. The movie started off really, really light and then went really, really dark. There was very little time for character development as well as plot explanation and that would have really helped this film. I have read the premise of these novels and it is an incredible fantasy story. Being able to make this film with the use of CGI gave it tremendous potential to be a great film. Still, when it comes to family oriented films you always have to remember a good portion of your viewers has an attention span of a common field mouse. Because of that major flaw, I would be quite surprised if a sequel is ever made, they have a lot to work on especially if they plan to put another 3 novels into one film. I would love to see possibly a directors cut or an extended version of this film so they can thicken up the story as it should be told.Still, Legend of the Guardians is something worth seeing if not only once. Just the spectacle of it is quite amazing and just seeing how far we have come to making CGI films as real as live action. This film couldn't set a better example.

I consider myself a true Dream Theater fan, being the proud owner of the previous 7 studio albums. Octavarium marks the 8th album recorded with the current band line up minus Keyboardists Jordan Ruhdes (his 4th) It is surly right to say that Dream Theater has had quite a journey. With every new release there was always something new to hear from this power group, and unfortunately for a time some of the fans (myself included) felt that Dream Theater was losing their touch. With their previous release `Train Of Thought' I felt that they weren't really trying to bring their fans something new. Rather, continue the dark and heavy sound that was first brought to us through `Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence' I mean...the album came out pretty quickly as well.I am happy to say that with 'Octavarium', Dream Theater really shows their talent full circle. You can hear their entire career in these eight tracks. Also they also were making a bold statement for Jordan Ruhdes saying "Back off he's here to stay!" Jordan really shows his skills with the 88 keys and even with a steel guitar as well. One could say this is 'his' best album...I mean if you really want to dive deep into thought here...the piano keys on the album cover must stand for something.The songs on this album are a balance of good and evil in a sense. There are positive tracks like the light `I Walk Beside You' to the fast and dark thrash sound of `Panic Attack'. The best songs on this album by far are the last two. `Sacrificed Sons' is a powerful ballad to the fallen in 9/11, as well as a reminder as to who committed the act 4 years ago. The self titled track `Octavarium' is nothing short of brilliant. It has a very distinct similarity to Pink Floyd the founders of Dream Theater's genere of music. Dream Theater really cranks it out on that one and it really is a song you just never heard from them before.Even though this album is a good listen, as a true fan it just doesn't live up to the albums of the past. Dream Theater's career is like a story. It began with `Images And Words' and reached the climax at `Scenes From A Memory. I don't want to say the band is going downhill, but it seems to me that their run may be drawing to a close. On the plus side, the members are working on separate projects and if the band ends up calling it quits we still will not have lost them for good. As Dream Theater said... "The Spirit Carries On."

Entourage is a great show and the only reason they are spliting the dvd's up is because the season was split up. It's so worth it because its the conclusion to the best season of the show thus far, season 4 was so so just for the record. Season 3 part two is a fantastic conclusion to a cliffhanger midpoint. I'm glad it's on DVD and I cannot wait to watch it. What I am hoping is that the next season will pull this show out of last seasons funk.

After the defeat of King Piccolo, Goku is still determined to get stronger. Now that evil has been vanquished he has one thing on his mind...to become the World Tournament Champion. After finding the most intense training possible he reunites with his friends...as a fully grown man. The tournament is going to be a challenge unlike any other because there is a mysterious yet familiar face signed up to fight and a strange girl that is furious because he never kept a promise he made long ago. It really does take a lot to be the best.Now my journey is complete and I am so happy that I have now seen the whole phenomenal story of Dragon Ball. This season is a lot less intense, yet with some very tense moments. It was so great to finally see these characters become young men and women, even though I am so use to them being older it was nice to finally see them grow up and make important choices in their lives. The tournament was probably some of the most intense action I have seen since the Kid Buu saga, and the final showdown between Goku and Piccolo is incredible. The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is now seeing Piccolo in the series entirety, it is crazy that in the end he was not as strong as he was in Dragon Ball. The again looking at the Z and GT adversaries, it does make sense. I intend to spend many hours of many days watching the whole story strait through as soon as I get all 4 of the Dragon Ball movies. I really liked how the last few episodes really took Goku to the next step in his life, by giving him an adventure with Chi Chi.I have to say that as action packed as Dragon Ball Z is, Dragon Ball is now my favorite, just because the premise is so much more down to earth and light hearted. Besides, who doesn't love a great origin story?IF YOU HAVE READ ALL MY REVIEWS ON DRAGON BALL, DRAGON BALL Z & DRAGON BALL GT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

I am so glad to know that I am one of the many reasons why this show is one of the best sitcoms on television today. Being part of a test screen audience for the pilot I knew it was going to make a big splash when it officially hit the airwaves. Now it's one of the most watched and now even nominated for an emmy award.Unfortunatly I didn't get a chance to watch any of this second season, so this was a must have purchase for me. The show pretty much picks up right where it leaves you in the first season with all it's nerdy glory. This time a few new things are thrown into the mix such as Penny getting into online gaming, Sheldon apparently picking up women and throwing the great Sara Gilbert into the main cast. Though I will admit while this second season is very much enjoyable I didn't get many belly laughs out of this season as I did the first. It was probably because the first season was an introduction to the routines and the jokes so of course when you see it for the first time you get a much more amped up reaction. Though I will say thatthe episode where Sheldon has coffee for the first time and pretends he's The Flash is classic!Still, I am by no means knocking the show because it is still enjoyable the acting is dead on and everybody should see it. I am just hoping that when season 3 comes along that my reaction to the show as a whole stays constant and doesn't dip.

I was always hearing rumors that a Tron sequel was in the works and we finally got in Tron Legacy.After waiting nearly over 30 years Tron returns to the movie going public like never before. Revolving around Flynns son Sam this movie pays a true tribute to its 1982 predecessor, by bringing back the same actors that made it big in the first place. Also, by attempting to push the bar in computer technology. The most amazing thing I saw in this movie was the ability to stick Jeff Bridges' head on a younger body to re-create a younger version of himself. Also all of the action sequences are amazing and the whole movie itself shows you just how much more advance the world of computers has become since the first movie. Even by paying tribute to some of the games that were played in the first film. It showed us that even those simple games got even more complex how things weren't just cubes and strait lines anymore. The computer world has evolved so much and so fast it has practically caught up with the real world itself. That makes the stakes much higher for our heros. What I also took from Tron Legacy is that we will never be perfect, we are always going to be discovering new things at every turn and just because they may not always keep us in our comfort zone we need to try and move forward and see what the future will bring to us.Acting wise the movie isn't at its strongest and like the first one it does have a few dead spots. Still Jeff Bridges is awesome and I was blown away that they managed to bring Bruce Boxlightner back into the spotlight and it seems like he now has some new projects in the works for his career.Tron Legacy, while it is not perfect, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something new.(but you gotta see the first one first) The best part about this movie was the soundtrack, Daft Punk drives this movie from beginning to end and even if you end up hating this movie you will still love the soundtrack. Now, there is an animated series premering this fall and there are talks of a third installment I am very curious to see where we will go next in the world of Tron.

After two mediocre seasons of `Ranma ?' the show bounces right back with a hysterical sixth season. It doesn't get any crazier than this folks. Ranma is wrapped up in a brand new bunch of adventures that will make get right back into the show and forget how bad seasons 4 & 5 were.In this season Ranma's career in high school only gets more difficult. He makes a brand new enemy Gosunkugi, a perfect embodiment of a nerd who wants Akane all to himself. Also the old school store owner is seeked out only to be a cracked out old kook who goes on about the glory days of Furinkan high school. This season brings back all the great supporting characters and even the great yet clumsy Dr. Tofu. What also makes this season great is the perfect blend of extreme comedy and seriousness. Happosais godson comes back with a vengeance in probably the most dramatic episode to date all because his name is Pantyhose. Then the family gets free tickets to the local amusement park only to have run out of money and food and win it all back in a no holds bard go-cart race, that is sure to leave you in stitches.With one more season left on the horizon it is good to know that this season brought back the true magic that makes `Ranma ?' that genius show that it is.*Recommended Episode: X-Mass Without Ranma?!*

Out of all the films that I have seen this year I would have to say that nothing was more of a letdown than Despicable Me. I am sure you are curious as to why. The acting was great I want to get that off the bat right away. Steve Carrell is an actor that always wows me with every performance live action or voice acting. Giving any actor who is normally looked at as the `good guy' a chance to play a villain is something they always jump at. The supporting cast was also great, Russell Brand was probably the biggest surprise for me just because of the character he voiced.What I hated about this movie was the story. Seeing all the trailers of this movie I really thought this was going to be a film about super villains just going at it trying to headway the crime of the century instead, this film turned out to be nothing but a Disney wanna be, by having Steve Carrells character adopt three orphan girls. Not that I had anything against the characters because the little one was just way too cute. Still, this movie tried way too hard to get at your emotions taking away from the whole super villain element. Also, because of this plot point Jason Siegel gets barely the screen time he deserved in this movie. I am sorry, but if you want to make a Disney movie make sure that Disney does it. I mean yes this film had to go up against Toy Story 3 and there was no way that Despicable Me was even going to match that movie from an emotional standpoint.It's films like this one that make me so mad that animation always has to be stereo typed as being geared towards children or has to be something the whole family can enjoy. Just because it is a cartoon doesn't mean it has to be tame. South Park and the Simpsons got it right making sure their films got PG-13 and above. When will the day come when we will realize that animation can be friendly for all ages so animated movies can be just as enjoyable and exciting as life action?

As a child of the 80's Transformers is probably known as the one of the staples of my generation. One of the most successful animated series every it was only a matter of time and patiences that The Transfomers would grace live action cinema. This movie was one of the biggest attractions for 2007 with many mixed feelings no one knew what to expect. Especially since Michael Bay was directing. Still having a Steven Speilberg producing and Michael Bay being known as the king of car chase you just had to keep an open mind or just see it for the sake of seeing it even if it ended up being terrible.This movie was probably one of the most overhyped since Indepence Day and when I finally got to see it, I was blown away by how awesome it was. The characters were very true to the original series. Shia LeBouf did a great job as Sam 'Spike' Witwicky. John Voit, John Touturo and all the others were great. There were a few changes that many of the loyal fans were able to find right away, but as long as Peter Cullen was doing the voice for Optimus Prime the errors weren't so bad. What made this movie so great for me was it made me feel like a kid again sitting in the theater with so many people in my age range it was one of the best experiences I ever had. Now I finally get to own this movie on DVD. The movie is fantastic for those who want to just have fun with a great pop corn flick. So buy watch it and just wait patiently for the sequil

What upset me the most was the fact that this movie was only playing in two theaters too far away from me. Now that I have finally seen it I have to say it was exactly was I expected. No crazy new animation (via Simpsons) No extremly complex origional story (Stewie Griffin The Untold Story) and no musicals and massive pop culture references that knock every famous person (South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncutt) All this movie did was give the fans more than 15 minutes of pure unadulturated insanity. It brought together all the favorite villians and threw all the best features that each character brings to the mix. This was probably one of the best movies to come out this year and it could have been so much bigger if people would only keep an open mind. Instead we have Spider-Man 3 all over the place....nice job corporate Hollywood.

`The Big Bang Theory' has become a staple in my television viewing since it first aired and after the past season I was glad to know that the show somewhat redeemed itself from an average second season. This time I am happy to say that season 4 has added a brand new dimension and that is the addition of more nerdy women!We only had Penny as a staple female role and she was the polar opposite of our nerdy foursome. When you add the characters of the cute, but not so nave Bernadette and the bizzaro Sheldon in the form of Amy Fara Fowler, it causes the Big Bang Theory to explode with more hilarity. It is so great to see just how women change these lovable characters in ways you never thought possible. Each episode just made me laugh and it just got better with every new one.I recommend this show to anyone I know, and while it may not be appealing to everyone, it is still one of the most original sitcoms to grace the small screen in a while.

I have been a Tim Burton fan since I first saw 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'and while I may not enjoy all of his work it is so hard for him to make a film that I will dislike. Sweeney Todd based on the famous musical, of course is one of the few in his collection I never got around to seeing. Well, the holiday season finally gave me this film and I loved it!If not for 'Edward Scissorhands', Sweeney Todd would probably be my favorite film of Burton. Johnny Depp is amazing as always and yes he sings! The rest of the cast including Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and yes even Sacha Baron-Cohen are all wonderful. Even if you have never seen this play you're gonna love it as it is Tim Burton doing what he does best.

So things are changing in the world of the Pevense kids. Peter and Susan have left for America while Edmond and Lucy are till stuck in England under the same roof of their annoying and Nerdy cousin Eustace. Suddenly, they are summoned back to Narnia and they board the strongest ship in the Narnian Navy, The Dawn Treader. Under the watchful eyes of Caspian the group is off on an adventure of a lifetime into the unknown wondering that they would find.This time around, I have to say I was not too satisfied. I know that the biggest (yet suttle) change was the transition of the film franchise from Disney to Fox. One thing you can definitely tell is the fact that the movie didn't seem all that magical and mystical as the first two. The acting was fine and the film does have a few great moments. Eustace was definitely a major hit for me. I love characters that solely base their worlds around facts and when they suddenly discover something that doesn't seem natural they try and figure out how it can possibly be natural. Will Poltier did a great job working off of Simon Pegg (The new voice of Reepicheep, fyi you will never figure out that the voice was changed).Unfortunately, the weak point of the movie for me was just the story. I am all for going out on a journey, but this one was just very slow with high point popping in. The ending of the film was probably the best part, because it was a very emotional one and there is a moment that will make you smile.So I am glad I saw 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader', but now I am wondering what will happen now. It has been announced that the next film will be 'The Magicians' Nephew' so we will be getting a prequel. I am really hoping that they manage to get all 7 books to the big screen so they gotta make this upcoming one count.

While the title of my review has probably been overused, that is the only word that can describe season three of this fantastic show. After a mediocre second season, the third season pumps in twice the laughs, twice the inteligence and twice the ingenious of Jim Parsons as the great Sheldon Cooper. The third season picks up with the boys returning home from the North Pole and suddenly Leonard and Penny are in a relationship. Before you know it the show takes an amazing twist with a whole new bunch of challenges for our genious foursome as they tackle being in relationships, dating and of course trying to keep Sheldon under control through it all.This season brings us some great milestones, such as Howard meeting the cute Bernadette, Sheldon sining Soft Kitty to Penny and of course the battle between Sheldon and Will Wheaton. The stars never miss a beat in this season and of course our favorite guest starts make their triumphant returns including a special surprise at the very end of the season. Still, this show continues to make me laugh and I am quite impressed with how well this season turned out. If you have never seen this show before this season contains the one episode you must see. The Einstein Approximation in which Sheldon gets stummped and goes insane. If you thought he was crazy before you have never seen anything yet.Now with an Emmy win for Sheldon, this show continues to ride strong, and hopefully for a few more seasons.

If the holiday of Haloween had a soundtrack, Iced Earth's 'Horror Show' would be it! Iced Earth has presented its fans with amazing concept albums in the past such as 'Night of the Stormrider' and 'The Dark Saga', but it is 'Horror Show' that tops them all. Each track off this record is based on the classic monsters of film and literature. From the powerful blast of 'Wolf' to the haunting epic 'Phantom Opera Ghost', the listener is transported to the world that has haunted many before rock music was ever a conception in the mind of man. Matt Barlow delivers amazing vocals, while new guitarist Larry Tarnowski shows Metallica a thing or two about new band members. When I first purchased this album it stayed in my CD player for almost one month. This album an ingenious as it is terrifying, so if you are an easily scared individual make sure you listen with a friend.

A revolution is beginning in the world of heavy metal and like Jon Schaffer said "We're the ones who are going to lead it." Iced Earth has always stood out as one of the most original bands in metal because of three factors. Concept albums: Nothing is better than music that tells a story. Starting with `Night of the Stormrider' Schaffer and his constantly changing band has been cranking out entire albums with songs that are all linked together, each an important piece of a grand tale. Vocals: Although Iced Earth lost one its most important members Matt Barlow, while his vocals will be missed Tim (Ripper) Owens brings a whole new level of energy to this group. Musicianship: Who says metal has to be just speed guitars and dirty lyrics? The use of a classical orchestra and beautiful lyrics turns heavy metal into a work of art. Iced Earth has used all three of these elements many times over."The Glorious Burden" is in fact a glorious piece of music. The concept is down to Earth and sends a message to us about how proud they are to be Americans and that we must remain proud by understanding history and remembering our darkest times so they must never happen again. This album sings about war from the earliest points in time `Attila' all the way until now with `Greenface' &amp; `When The Eagle Cries'. Probably the highlight of this album is the 23-minute long epic of the bloodiest battle and the darkest moment in American history. "Of course I am describing `Gettysburg. What is so incredible about this epic are the italics in the booklet written by Jon Schaffer and the beauty of the Prague Symphony Orchestra. It is almost as if you can see the open fields blue on one side and gray on the other as they rushed into battle on those three horrific days. The other highlights of this epic are the famous songs of war as composed in that time blended into the epic through the strings of both the violins and guitars. Iced Earth has always been my favorite heavy metal group and this album should be heard by all metal fans or not just to see the incredible amount of thought and creativity that was put into this incredible masterpiece. Jon Schaffer says this is the best album he ever made since starting Iced Earth...but it just might be the greatest Heavy Metal record EVER!!!

What happens when you put the following together? A tennis prodigy, a country girl, a wannabe starlet, a rebel, a brainiac, a gentile giant, a space case, a boy crazy softball MVP, a comic book reading future house wife of the year, and a young girl with a heart of gold who can throw a wicked fastball. What you get is the starting lineup of characters in anime show `Princess Nine.'The chairwoman of an exclusive all girls' prep school once believed she had it all. A bright future with a young all star pitcher destined to become the greatest pitcher in all of Japan. When controversy took over his life her life was thrown into the madness and left alone. Only from there she climbed to the top and along with her stature had a daughter who was destined to become the youngest tennis pro in all of Japan. All was in place until she found a shadow from her past in the pitching arm of a 15 year old girl named Ryo, who happened to be the daughter of her lost love. With the past rushing back to her, she felt it necessary to give her life closure and clear her lost loves name. She recruits Ryo to become the starting pitcher of Japans very first all girls high school baseball team. With the help of an old friend and a bunch of very diverse personalities, the team is formed. Now, the battle begins to get to the championship series and prove to the world that baseball is not just for the boys.This story revolves around three major characters, Ryo, Izumi (the tennis player) and her mother (The chairwoman). It is a brilliant story about baseball, coming of age and lost love. The character development is absolutely brilliant. With such a huge cast of characters within only a 26 episode span, each character becomes such a huge part of the story. What makes anime so great is the detail put into every character and not just the main ones. There are great side stories and moving back stories on all the members of the girls' team. Each girl is unique with a personality that can be related to by someone. There are some hysterical moments and moments that will make you shed a tear. If you are a fan of sports movies you will probably like this show. Even if you have never seen an anime show in your life, this show is very unlike the norm. There are a lot of moments that are derived from some of the great sports movies in the past 40 years. You can surly see moments from films like: The Bad News Bears, The Sandlot, and The Natural, (just to name a few). It is a show that lets the viewer know that you can always achieve your goals in all areas of life even if the toughest of obstacles are thrown in front of you. I loved this show and honestly I wish there was more of it I just felt that there was so much more of a story to be told, but still `Princess Nine' is a winner.

After months of anticipation since the view of the teaser trailer, Scott Pilgrim finally hit the big screen. I was fortunate to see it on opening weekend, and I have to say that I was very satisfied. Scott Pilgrim VS. The World like the other well known Edgar Wright films such as Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is just as fast and just as zaney. What made me want to see this film of course besides the director is that this story is based on a 6 volume graphic novel. Also the cast is quite incredible and especially with the library of films that Michael Cera has to his name, colaborating with Wright was something that intrigued me. Scott Pilgrim is a two hour geeks wet dream, there is so much awesomeness you take away from this film. The pop culture references, the comic book/anime/video game theme throughout and the acting dare I say it at least for the film it was suppose to be was brilliant. As far as the actors go, as I expected Keiran Culkin pratically stole this movie. His character in the book was the funniest and did not disappoint with his performance. Another surprise for me was the newcommer Ellen Wong. I mean she played a girl named Knives...how cool is that?! Finally, I have to say that I was very impressed with Michael Cera in this movie, while he still uses his typical charm that you have seen in his films, he actually is not a fall back guy he actually grabs his balls and takes charge as the main character so I gotta say he did quite a good job as Scott Pilgrim.Compared to the books, it starts out accurate pratically page for page, but as it progresses starts to go in a very different direction. Most fans of the book would probably be a little upset Still, for a movie based on this story it was for the better. This movie still kept the main meat of the story intact and kept the fun factor sky high. I do have to say that Scott Pilgrim VS. The World is not a movie for everyone, but based on what I have said if you feel this is something you would enjoy I suggest you see it because you will most likely love it! Oh of course if you have seen this movie like I did (3 times to be exact) The DVD/Blue Ray is totally worth it! There is no doubt that I will watch it no less than 500 times in the first month of ownership.

Hopefully you are already seen my first review of Haruhi Suzumiya. This show is such a blast to watch, but as I had written I was quite surprised how a show with such originality came to a screeching halt with so many unanswered questions. Well here we have season 2! The funny thing I have to say about season two is that it it's not really an official second season yet it does `fill in the gaps' so to speak.This season takes place in different intervals between the original 14 episodes and that is something that I have grown to love in storytelling. It's very similar to Batman: Under The Red Hood. While giving us an entire epilogue this piece of the story gives us a few gap fillers that turn the original story of Death in the Family into a much deeper story it other pawns in play. So Haruhi does the exact same thing. Now I just want to say that you need to brace yourself for a spoiler alert. This season features the Episodes known as `The Endless 8' Yes you are pretty much going to see the same episode eight times with a few small differences, but it is probably one of the most original ideas to keep a story going and the best part is it will take you a little bit of time trying to figure out why it is happening.While this season was just as entertaining I am still trying to find out where it is going. If you watch all the episodes in order you are still left with a few more of the same questions. Still, the major question I had was answered and that is that the crazy adventures of the S.O.S. Brigade are not through yet.

What happens when you are an ex-CIA agent? With all the knowledge of worl government secrets is it all about haning up your gear and moving on to a happy retirement? Apparently not in the film RED. Bruce Willis playes a retired agent who is suddenly a target for termination by the very people who employed him and they will stop at nothing to see him dead. Even if that means getting your butt kicked many times over by the guy you are instructed to kill.RED is an entertaining hysterical ride. The cast is awesome, getting some of the most well known drama/action stars of the past 25-30 years to fill the roles of government assigned assasins in their golden years is nothing short of brilliant. Morgan Freemen delivers priceless one liners, John Malkovich is flat out hysterical and Helen Mirren....well all I can say is holy bejezus! Of course I have to say the rest of the cast was great. Karl Urban is really showing us that he is a great actor post LOTR. He does exceptionally well in these comic book adaption films and now it has been announced he will be playing Judge Dredd in the much needed re-dux. Brian Cox and Mary-Louise Parker also did a great job, though I didn't expect anything less. Probably the biggest surprise was Richard Dryfus...just because I haven't seen him in a movie in like FOREVER!All and all, RED is a fun film based on a comic book. I have it on DVD and it is definitely one of the few I will enjoy watching many times over.

We all know of Facebook and the staple it has become in our culture, but how did it become what it is today? 'The Social Network' is the story of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and shows us how he went from average Harvard student to the youngest billionare in the world today. Now, first and formost this story is not entirely factual. The film, which David Fincher brilliantly directs is based on a novel that is also not entirley based on 100% fact. However, when it comes to seeing a movie esepcially a movie about actual events as long as it is done well by the cast and crew it doesn't have to be 100% acurate (At least for me)'The Social Network gets every thing right when it comes to making an excellent film. The acting is supurb some performances are better than others as always. The script is great, Aaron Sorkin gives us a brilliant screen play and his fast switching diologue is perfect for a movie like this one because people who have such extrem brain power tend to talk like that to themselves and others. The sountrack drives this movie. As a huge fan of Trent Reznor it is amazing to see him break away from the industrial/pop music scene and put his haunting sound into film soundtrack. Of course David Fincher as I mentioned did a fantastic job brining us this film it is fast paced entertaining and all around awesome. The Social Network was one of the five films that I chose to be the best in 2010 and now it is nominated for best picture. So win or not it was well done and I highly recommend it.

Richard Linklater was the perfect director to remake this classic comedy, because Linklater knows that music needs to move a movie. 'Bad News Bears' has a soundtrack that goes right up there with 'Dazed & Confused' and 'School of Rock'. This soundtrack pays homage to the origional films score from 'Carmen' and pays tribute to the happening 70's with some awesome classic rock tunes. Artists include John Fogerty, Alice Cooper and Ted Nugent. There are also so great covers of some well known classics inlcuding a decent cover of 'Wipeout' by underground sensations Phantom Planet. And of course to entertain the mainstream fans a song from Simple Plan. If you don't feel that the movie is up to par with the 1976 classic I beleive if they would have made a rock soundtrack to the origional these songs would have surley made the cut.

...Try being a Super Villain. That is what the film 'Megamind' is all about. Dreamworks took the classic good vs. evil battle and gave all of us the answer to that burning question. So, what exactly does happen when evil finally triumphs? Megamind is Metro City's most notorious villain and all he wants to do is finally thwart Metroman or as he prefers to call him...Mr. Goody Two-shoes. After years and years of planning and plotting he finally did it! Then suddenly, something unusual happens...Megamind has nothing to do! He then realizes...there is only one thing left to do, create a new hero. Now, he has that accomplished it looks like the new hero has plans of his own and they are not for the good of mankind.This film was such a great comedy. While Pixar gave us 'The Incredible', 'Megamind' is a completely different story that plays on the fan boy fantasies. Throw a great comedic cast together and some of the best CGI Dreamworks has given us in years and you get a classic. Will Ferrel, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt give us a great combination of laughs and heart. It brings us into the minds of heroes and villains and shows us that they actually are more than just crazy gadgets and cheesy monologues. They are people and when the action takes a back seat in this film you see it and it is done quite well. Probably the biggest surprise in this film is David Cross as the voice of Minion. He always runs hot and cold with the average movie goers, but this time he shines and gives us such awesome moments in the film. It's the smart comedy and the timing of the jokes that makes this movie a real winner.If you are a parent looking for a movie for your young ones or if you are a classic comic book geek 'Megamind' delivers a one two punch. It was one of the most overlooked films of last year and a great ride from beginning to end.

Heroes started out as a phenomenon. It was a show that caught on like Lost, House and all the other major shows that were released around it's time. Sadley after an extremly successful first season and a TV writters strike Heores never was the same.This season was titled Redemption and it was a season that deserved the title. We were introduced to some great new characters as well as a very interesting new story. Yet the show never was able to bring itself back to the impactful first season and NBC just decided to cit the chord. To me I am all about closure and not to give Heores a proper send off was terrible. I had heard there were plans for a 2 hour series finale made for TV movie, but it was scrapped. Either way as a whole Heroes was a very interesting take on the whole superhero theme and I am very glad to know that I was able to be a part of it.

It is amazing how things always seem to swing in my favor. One week before the brand new Third Eye Blind album, 'Ursa Major' is about to hit stores I manage to recover my lost review from their previous album released 6 YEARS AGO!!! I remember that I was one of the first people to pick up 'Out of The Vain'. I managed to snag the now discontinued bonus DVD edition. So enjoy how much I anticipated their previous release. It is just a taste of what my review for 'Ursa Major' will be when I post it next week.Four long years have past since 3eb's last triumph `Blue'. For four long years all of 3eb's loyal fans have waited for the arrival of the anticipated 3rd album. Now, after many name and release date changes THIRD EYE BLIND IS BACK!!! The new album `Out of the Vain' definitely lives up to its anticipation as well as its name. The whole band managed their time well to produce one incredible album and each song sounds as if it really did pour out of the bands very blood and soul because each song is one that has to be heard more than five times. It is a must have for all 3eb fans the album has the power and energy from the first album and the original haunting musicianship of the second. The album starts off with the energetic `Faster' and ends with the sweet serenade `Good Man' and like always 3eb never disappoints its fans with a little surprise. I would love to tell you, but that would just be cruel wouldn't it? Let's just say when you think the album it is only just beginning. As for 3eb it's great to have them back just in time for the summer and to all you 3eb fans put your car windows down and blast this baby!!!

Animaniacs may have been one of the smartest tv shows ever created, but Pinky & The Brain beat it as a successful spin off. The characters are amazing a true homage to the classic comic duos in tv and cinema. This show featured the greatest television episode. It was shown on Animaniacs first but ran on this show in syndication. The hunt for the red dragon toenail clippings, with Pinky attempting to sing in rhyme. Pure genuis! HA HA NARF!

First of all, I am so happy that this movie is finally being released. The Jetsons are without a doubt, one of the most beloved television familes that have ever graced the small screen. Like the Simpsons, they are one of the very few to have graced the big screen in full animated glory.This movie is a very meaningful one for many reasons. It was the final performances of George O'Hannlon (George Jetson) and Mel Blanc (Mr. Spacely and a great deal of additional cartoon characters) Unfortunatly these gifted men lost their lives in the middle of the filming and you can definitely hear it in the voice of George in bit parts. This was also one of the first animated films to use a very primitive 3-D computer animation. Unfortunatly, I only got to see this movie when it was put on video so I cannot wait to try it out on my 42 inch plasma! It was also a movie that really kept the true elements of the Jetsons show intact with just a few new spins. Some examples would the new home, the music videos of songs done perfectly by Tiffany and also messages about perserving the environment which was just starting to become a topic of major concern in the late 1980's early 1990'sThe Jetsons The Movie is one of my all time favorites and it is classic in my eyes. It is non stop fun with a little of everything. This true space age family is one of the few that should be preserved for many generations to come to let them know that back then TV family was a true treasure to behold.Now that I finally have the movie in my hands I will say this. I don't care if there are no crazy special features I just have the movie and that's all I Wanted!!!

A staple of historic television is the family sitcom, Leave It To Beaver, The Brady Bunch, Family Ties, Full House and so many more. They are the stories of unity, life lessons and love. Now take that loving family and make them all deformed due to living near a toxic waste dump. Say hello to the Oblongs!This show lasted for only one year on the WB now CW 11. It was one of the most revolutionary animated sitcoms way before it's time. If it were to be released now it would probably be a smash hit. This is also perhaps Will Ferrel's best performance playing the loving and devoted father Bob, who is nothing but a bouncing torso with the best one liners like 'Pickles, have you seen my ankle weights?! These characters may not the be the most plesent to look at or some of the things they do may cause the gag reflex to kick in. Yet, this show brings out the diversity of rich and poor folk, important moral values and of course the importance of family. Give this overlooked gem a try, I promise you will get a laugh.

The teen comedy seemed to be in a serious rut since the American Pie trilogy with very few gems popping up in a mountain of ordinary rocks. It is time to head back to basics with a little of todays appeal. Charlie Bartlett is a rich boy kicked out of his elite prep school so he decides to go to regualr public school. His wishy washy mom who doesn't really have much say in the matter just wants him to be happy and make friends. He enters a world of tight clicks and very pissed off teenagers and he wonders why everyone can't just be happy and cruise through life. So starting as a perscription drug pusher he ends up being a voice for the students to seek advice. His willingness to listen allows the students to let their guard down and realize they are not all different as they thought.This movie really blends the classic John Hughes comedies of old with other classic coming of age films such as The Graduate. It moves a bit slow but the acting is very high quality and the story is pretty fresh and fun to watch. Robert Downey Jr. gives an amazing performace as the principal of the public school. This film probably won't get as much credit as it deserves, but if you want to watch a really good teen comedy give this one a whirl.

No worries anymore for the cast of Boston Legal, as season 3 comes to a close and onto DVD. This season is probably the best thus far because it touches upon the story of Jerry 'Hands' Espinson (Played by the brilliant Christian Clemson) There are great additions to the cast such has the witty Jeffrey Coho (Creig Bierko) The ice queen Claire Sims (Constance Zimmer) and the tough cookie that never sells herself short Bethany Horowitz (Meredith Eaton, who created the great "don't look down' running gag) The cases still run from the serious to abstract with more of an emphasis on the characteristics of the judges and how some will intimidate and some times stimulate everyone all the way to Alan Shore. There are great stories that take place within the office itself including the strange 'hands off' policy Denny Crane places on Shirley Schmidt. This season is a real treat to be seen making the show bigger and better with every episode and great special apperiences, by Katey Segal, Bernidette Peters, Armin Shimmerman (Another Star Trek cast member) Just to name a few. More importantly more running gags making fun of their very own show on camera, anyone that can laugh at themselves is always comedy gold. Enjoy season three or Boston Legal and like the great William Shattner and James Spader say at end of the season..."To Next Season" Cheers!

I have to agree with alot of the people reviewing this package. I mean Family Guy is Family Guy and the show is fantastic. (hence the 3 stars) But splitting up a season into two sepreate volumes, I mean its one of the most viewed shows on network television surley you don't need the money! I mean I don't think anyone will watch the special features! The show is pretty much all you need! I can already draw Peter Griffen too thank you very much. Just leaving the season finale out of this volume and have me and all the other fans wait for a 6th volume is just cruel. I can bet that the Star Wars spoof season premiere will be sold as a sinlge dvd and named volume 7.

It's been one year since seven of the greatest heroes of the DC universe joined forces to protect the world. They have assisted allies, saved planets from monstrous tyrants and even protected Earth from their own arch enemies. In the second season of `Justice League' the league is faced with even greater challenges that put their own lives and their own trust towards one another to the test.I have been a true fan of this show since the first year it aired and I cannot wait for this season to be released. What makes this season so incredible are the stories that come with each epic episode. This season features the heroes going through alternate dimensions to discover a horrible future as well as even more terrifying versions of themselves. (Foreshadow! Foreshadow!) Another alliance of super villains is forged, even more powerful than the alliance in the first season with Gorilla Grodd leading the pack. (Foreshadow! Foreshadow!) After many angry e-mails and letters send to Bruce Timm and company about the extreme downgrading of Superman, Timm comes back with two fantastic stories about Superman that will truly leave you satisfied. However, with the good comes bad. The now infamous `Batman rogues gallery of villains ban' takes effect with the Justice League's final showdown with The Joker. This episode is by far my favorite because it takes place in real time and Mark Hammil delivers his greatest performance as the clown prince of crime since `Mask of the Phantasm'.This entire season leads up to the final episode featuring the original seven with a spectacular three part finale in `Starcrossed' I will not give anything away in this episode, especially if there are first time fans reading this. I will say this, get this DVD set and prepare to be blown away by fantastic stories and unforgettable moments that will only keep you drooling for more. Have patience because the word `more' with this television show is not to be taken lightly.

In print Anime/Manga comes in so many forms, but usually in the world of Television/Movies there are two disticnt types. The world of Giant Robots, Gaming Monsters, Vampires Etc. Then there is the world of Comedy, sometimes it contains a Sci-Fi twist. When it doesn't you have a great show like "Love Hina"This is the story of Kaitaro Urashima. He is an 18 year old failure and never seems to have anything good happen to him. All these years he has been keeping a very important promise to a very important girl. He has to go to Tokyo University meet the girl there and lived hapily ever after. There is a major catch...he has no idea who the girl is anymore! So after failing again and again he somehow ends up becoming the manager of his Grandmothers all girl dormatory. There he meets his renters. Kasune a flirtatious girl in her prime. Shinobu, a shy girl but an artist in the kitchen. Motoko, a teenaged amazonian/samurai wannabe with a full on girl power attitude. Su, a wacky inventor who acts like she has had way too much sugar. Then there is the studious and stunning Naru, who Kaitaro creates a real love/hate bond with. She wants to help him get into Tokyo U, but at the same time he is trying to forget the girl he has made the promise to because he might just be falling for Naru.This is a very enjoyable show one of the best comedies that Anime has to offer. It may not have all the flashy fights and guns, but it does have alot of fists thrown when Kaitaro ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time (It happens often) While the story is very simple the characters are very comlex and relatable. They go through the exact same things we do everyday as high school and college students. Well....not all of them do, but you will figure out who does. There are a lot of other pluses to this show. Other side characters, an incredible soundtrack and the premise would even tempt your girlfriend/boyfriend to watch an episode or two...or more.

The tagline of this film says it all, `Inner City meets Outter Space'. `Attack The Block' is the first attempt at directing for Edgar Wrights right hand man Joe Cornish. What he gives us is 90 minutes of pure cult classic fun. This is a movie that I never would have known about if it was not buzzed about on YouTube and I loved every bit of it.The movie has a great cast including Nick Frost, but what amazes me is how much was able to be fit into this movie. You have moments that scare you and moments that make laugh out loud and this is why we go to the movies in the first place. There is not much I really can say without spoiling it , but like the tagline how could miss this one?

What would you do if you suddenly realized you had the power to take life? Well the TV series of Death Note could teach you a thing or two. Light Yagami is an anti social prodigy that suffers from inner torment of unjustice in the world. Suddenly he comes across a strange notebook called The Death Note. Suddenly he realizes that he has the power to re-shape the world in his image, by taking the lives of criminals, rapists, murderers and all those that pose a threat to a safe world. All goes well until the police and international security teams start realizing that the mystrious constant death of evil people is not right. It is now up to Light to keep his tracks hidden from Super-cop 'L' who keeps getting closer and closer.This show really has alot of promise. It is the first Anime I have seen that blends fantasy with true white knuckle suspence and police stories. Unfortunatly while the first few episodes are nothing short of brilliant as the story goes on the enjoyment goes down the tubes. After the character of Misa is introduced there are points where I just get sick to my stomach. The diologue gets terrible the story gets boring and there are moments when I just want to hurl the remote control at my television. I feel that the show was too long, which was the reason why there are parts of the show I dispised. The ending while I don't want to give it away was something that could have been done so much better. They could have put much better stories in the show for time fillers like back stories and character origins.I know there are plenty of people out there that do love this show and for that all the power to you. After seeing this show from begining to end and being a fan of most anime I am glad that I did get to see the show, but it's just not my cup of tea.

As a product of the '80s how could I not at least give this movie a try? While this one as well as the first installment were not given much of a fair fight amongst critics, like in the film the true fans of The Chipmunks...and The Chippetes have spoken.The Squeakuel picks up where the first one left off and the best part about sequels, is there is a chance for more character development. This movie brought alot of the TV series into it byt sending the boys off to school and fitting in with kids their age. I have to say I did not expect them to end up in High School, but then again we really don't how old they are in the movie. The boys now have to face the everyday challenges of life, fitting and more importantly knowing what comes first in life. Adding the Chippetes into this second film is a treat for us fans of the 1980's show. The girls were very well voiced and had the characterisitcs of their animated counterparts...well not so much Brittney...yet. While they didn't get as much face time as I would have wanted they did play an important role in the movie and now there is a 3rd installment in the works so I am wondering what is going to happen. I would love to see a singing showdown between the two groups singing The Boys/Girls of Rock N' Roll.This movie was adorable and I had a big smile on my face from begining to end. If you liked the first Chipmunks you will enjoy this one just as much.

I always have loved the DCAU, but I never would have expected this show to be as great as it is! Just as dramatic, entertaining and action packed as the classic shows that have came before it.I feel what makes this show so great, is that unlike a show like Teen Titans is the fact that these young heroes are incorporated with their senior counterparts. They face the same rogues galleries as they do and have just as many life/death situations. Along with being teenagers it adds an extra dimension to them characters and heroes. The packaging for this dvd set and even the following dvd with the rest of the first season is stupid. Still, the show itself makes you forget about all that junk. Watch this show it is fantastic!Oh yea and the rest of Season 1 is pretty awesome too. A fantastic twist!

As a DBZ fan all throughout college and wasted somewhere between 2000-3000 dollars on videos. Funimation (the real English team behind DBZ) finally decided to bring the series of DBZ to DVD ha!(DBZDVD!). But it is much more than just seaons.For those who need a little history the first two sagas of DBZ were own by Pioneer entrertainment and they edited the crap out of them. Also the voice acting was poor the background music stunk and the stories just weren't well put together you knew something was missing. Funimation took the series and created two versions for vhs and it was the first time you were able to see DBZ uncut in all its bloody glory. Also a brand new voice staff was brought in with voice talents of Sonny Strait, Christopher Sabbat etc.The first season which introduces Goku and his friends from the preceeding series Dragon Ball and opens the story in a whole new way. Goku now learns he is from outter space and one of the last of his race called Saiyans. He also learned that Saiyans are not very nice especially when the first one he meets is his own older brother Raditz who tries to kill him. Now there are two more coming in search for the infamous Dragon Balls. It is up to Goku's sworn enemy Picollo to train Goku's 4 year old son Gohan that he has a power deep within and might just be more powerful than he knows.This DVD set is worth it because now that Anime is so far beyond mainstreem on the western side of the world. It was time for Dragon Ball Z to be removed of its guenia pig status and finally be revieled that this was not a kids show! Even though it is cropped for wide screen format it really doesn't seem to bother me. But now the first seaons is uncut so the violence his not cleaned up there is plenty of cuts blood and bruses and most importantly there is more story and the voices from all the funimation owned sagas are doing what they do best for this first season. If you like DBZ this is a worthy set for your collection.

Once you see the trailer for this film you will be obsessed with wanting to see it. 'Origin: Spirits of the Past' is a very unique film in the Anime world. It is a very origonal story of a future in which man's follies to improve nature ends up with nature controling man and their means to survive. The story takes place 300 years after a global turn of events and now a young boy named Agito uncovers a link to a past he never knew in a girl named Toola. Toola doesn't understand this world, and yearns to go back to the world that she remembers. Through this meeting Nature is lashing out against humanity saying this girl with be the final downfall of man.What captured me in this film was the opening sequesnce. It is amazing how the perfect art direction and music can turn a moment in time that is so terrifying into something beautiful. The animation helps a lot as well. It is a beautiful and one of as kind blend of CGI and classic cell animation. However, this film did lack in the character development department. I didn't really find any of the characters turly memorable and there was just not enough in there to really have the characters create as much of an impact as the animation. The story is very easy to follow, which is a hard thing to find in anime films so this movie will just fly by as you watch it.This movie is definitely something to be seen, but wheater you think it is good or bad will be entirley up to you.

Before I begin this review I want to set the record straight because of some nasty comments on got my Shrek Complete story DVD release.Please be aware that I am reviewing the DVD and not the 4 disc DVD Blu Ray combo pack. While yes the Blu Ray is a better buy because of the extra special features if you have a Blu Ray player it is worth the extra cash. Still, to me the only thing I was upset about was the fact that `Destino' the musical short that was a collaboration between Walt Disney and famous surreal artist Salvadore Dali is NOT featured on the DVD. I don't intend on owning a Blu-Ray player and personally I don't feel you need the DVD and Blu Ray of the same movie. Also all the special features of the Blu-Ray minus Destino are all on the DVD. So I prefer the DVD and you can see Destino on YouTube for free. Now, that we covered that on to the film review.Disney is without a doubt the proverbial God of animation. His company has given us films that have shaped our culture, the movies we see and just remind us to never stop dreaming and wishing for your desires to come true. Now, from out of the Disney vault comes debatably his most original and boldest of all of his, now 50 animated classic. That film is Fantasia, and it is one of the few of his classics to treat us with a sequel.(That means it is not a direct to DVD film nor was it a Disney Movietoons film). For the first time, both Fantasia films are in a two disc set.Fantasia is probably one of the greatest films ever made in all of film because of the fact that it was a project to show how music is able to create a story and project wild imaginative creatures and characters. It was also a film that paid tribute to the messages and stories that the featured composers portrayed in their musical platforms. The first film, which I still can't believe is over 60 years old has been cleaned up and re-mastered which unbelievable brilliance. First seeing the movie when I was 8 years old, while I did find portions of it to be very boring I was still amazed by how colorful and creative it was. The music is probably some of the most beautiful in all of classical music. While music is what drives these animated segments, you don't get names, but the music plays such an impact and drives the stories so well you know the faces of the characters. Probably the pieces that do it the best is the Song of The Hours and the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Still, everything in Fantasia is wonderful and seeing it again after all this time reminded me of how great it is and while it really isn't a movie that should be seen by young children, it should be shared by all generations.We move on to Fantasia 2000, which is one of the few rare classic sequel films in Disney's library. I had the pleasure of seeing this one on the big screen. It is a little different in some good ways, the only bad part about it is the fact that it is too short compared to its predecessor. It features animation in many different styles and also a few different styles of music besides classical. My favorite would have to be `Rhapsody in Blue'. The animation pays tribute to Al Herschfeld's unique artistic style and piece is a classical jazz piece by George Gershwin whos music has given life to many works of film and theater. The narration is also portrayed by a great group of actors and modern day composers.Both of these films are great on their own and the special features on this film are definitely a secondary. These two films are two of the best if not two of the most important films in animation and to miss them would be horrible. Oh I know so many people made a huge stink about the Beethoven Sonata not having the 'Black Centaurs' in the film calling the film not the full film. I saw the cut scenes on YouTube and wheather there or not is completely meaningless to the film as a whole. If people are so bent on the whole 'Racsit' factor of Fantasia and that not including this is an insult on the African American populace of this country. Then go complain about the Disney company not releasing 'Song Of The South' on DVD.

Some of us dream of living in a world that is a little less ordinary. Usually we end up meeting someone that wants to live in that kind of a world a little more. Still, no one wanting that kind of life comes close to an eccentric girl named Haruhi Suzumiya.This short lived 14 episode favorite is narrated by 14 year old Kyon and boy entering high school ready to adjust to the normal world. All he has to do is forget about his fantasies of the paranomal and fantastic. All of a sudden the girl that sits behind him in class is not ready to let that world go and before he knows it Kyon is dragged into starting the S.O.S. Brigade a club bent on uncovering the secrets of the world we just can't find or explain. All of a sudden the members begin to sign up and they each turn out to be something unexpected. Yuki Nagato is a silent genius with her nose in the books, Mikuru Asahina is a cute and extremly shy Junior with a few key 'assets' and Istuki Koizumi is an exchange student always with a smile on his face ready for the next S.O.S. Brigade adventure. Haruhi seems be enjoying herself, but Kyon knows something she doesn't Haruhi recruited an Alien Android a Time Traveler from the future and an ESPer that belongs to an entire organization whose mission is to keep the world in balance. Oh and apparently they are all keeping their eye on Haruhi because she has the ability to create new worlds and destroy old ones in the process. So why is she so bored with life...she doesn't know she can do that. So much for an ordinary life Kyon.Strangly I discovered this show by stumbling onto a youtube music video of the three female leads dancing to an ultra poppy sweedish trance song. When I read about the show it seemed like a Breakfast Club meets X-Files kinda of show. Me being a fan of the anime comedy genre, I decided to give it a watch. The story is completly origional the chracters at least the normal ones are very relatable and the adventures they go on can be a bit Scooby Doo at times, but never the less alot of fun. Like your typical sci-fi anime there are alot of gaps to complete after the show ends. There is defintely a lot more to this story and I am hoping that I get to see it since there are rumors of a second season in the works.

'Clash of The Titans' was one of those movies that came out in the zany 80s. Like most of those movies they were fun to watch, but if you wanted them to be these great epics you had to turn to very crude special effects. With where we are right now in film making we can do almost anything from Dinosaurs, to transforming robots. So, naturally why not take some of these old honky-tonk 80s epics and turn them into something amazing?!Clash of the Titans was a good choice to give one of these modern day makeovers to. The epic battles with mythical Greek monsters in this day and age would look incredible...and they did. Still, the guys who gave this movie a makeover sort of forgot to finish the job. The movie was lacking extremely of acting talent, character development and story. Now I went to see this movie in the theaters because the action sequences looked great and yes they were. During the softer points in the movie I was flat out bored. The acting was bland, and even though Liam Neason and Ralph Finnes brought all they could to the table and they did a decent job, it still just didn't seem to work. Also the movie while it paced quite well, it just went a little too fast. I thought that the battles with the giant scorpions and Medusa just went way too quickly I completely didn't know there was a fight going on. Don't even get me started on the Kraken battle...I don't even know if there was a battle with the Kraken because I think the movie ended right when it finally showed up on the screen.A great deal of film appreciators feel that re-making films is a bad idea, I say yes and no, because let's face it do you really think that a kid born after 1990 is going to ask his/her mom or dad to rent the 1981 'Clash of the Titans'? Odds are no, so why not bring some of these movies to the modern day, clean them up add some great effects and there you have it. Still, when you decide that this is a movie you want to re-do make you actually make it better than the original! Not the same and definitely not worse. 'Clash of Titans' is nothing but an epic of failure. Still, I am glad that I did see it and I am glad that the things I expected in the film to be good were and that's why I gave it 2 stars.Oh on a personal note, supposedly there is a re-make of 'The NeverEnding Story' in the works....GET GUERLLMO DelTORO ON THE PHONE....PLEASE!!!

It truly is the year of the 90's. From Weezer to Better Than Ezra some of the most awesome bands are releasing new albums with the loyal fans in mind. Staind's new cd `Chapter V' is no exception. Like all the other groups Staind brings full circle all of the sound and splendor from the last 3 cds. There are tracks like `Run Away' & `Falling' which reminds us of the good old days when Staind was a raw power house of noise. `Cross To Bear and `Please' brings us the hard songs with meaningful lyrics and of course you get their most melodic and with songs like "Take This." There are even some new sounds in there as well with songs like `Reply'. This new album is a true statement from this now power group. It is saying that there is no slowing down in sight and of course most importantly they are saying thank you to all the fans who have been there from the beginning by giving us something old. Who knows what Staind will come out with next? The track `Everything Changes' definitely lets us know that Staind at this point in time has the ability to anything they can now...because this surly opens a new chapter on the road to greatness.

In such a terrible year of movies, it's no wonder an independent film got all the rave. Why not, big business has caused films to lose all the elements that make the movie going public want to sit in a theater. No one knows how to tell a good story, put the right actors in the right role, and even know how to tug at the human emotions. Slumdog Millionaire on the other hand, did know what to do.This film is the story of a boy named Jamal who came out of the slums of Mumbai India, to end up on the Indian version of the hit game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and he wins! Because of that he is thrust into the worst few hours of his life because he was accused of cheating. You'd like to think his spirit is being crushed, then the story begins, the story of how he knew each and every answer. Then as the story unfolds you are brought into a grand story of family, survival, betrayal and true love. The real heavy hitter is when the police find out exactly why Jamal got on that show and it really makes you wonder about your own life and what truly are treasures in our lives.I was blown away by this movie for many different reasons. The acting, the story, the music...you name it was a cut above everything I had seen all year. This movie could not have been released in a better time. A time when we in America think we have it bad during a time of misfortune. It teaches us to really look deep inside and find what matters to us and not take things for granted. This movie should also teach the big movie companies a thing or two. I think it is time to stop figuring out how much money a movie can make and just put a great story on the screen. A good story is what will bring the crowds. I mean no offense to Heath Ledger, but when a role in a summer blockbuster based on a comic book is given an Oscar. It just shows you how the so called Oscar worthy movies has gone downhill.*To redeem myself I thought that Heath Ledger was great in The Dark Knight and truly deserved it! It just shows you that there was not a single better performance in 2008 for a supporting role.

I saw the preview for `Animusic 2' and was very eager to get my hands on this new 8 track DVD. After watching it I would have to say that this DVD was just a bit over hyped. `Animusic 2' is not a bad watch at all. I enjoyed watching it, but I think that is the secret word here. This DVD was more visual than musical. The original's music was what really made the overall DVD great. I loved the new sequences from a visual standpoint. It was a huge step forward from the original. The highpoints were the return of the stickman with his new posse as well as the starship grooving robots and who can forget the amazing finale in `Heavy Light'. The visuals were great but the music was just not the perfect match and that was a huge step back. If there will be an `Animusic 3', which there are very few rumors about, I feel Wayne Lyttle needs to remember that its not `Animusic' with out the music.

If you think that Anime is just starting to hit major popularity, think again! Back in the 1950s and 1960s, while there wasn't much of a selection there were three huge Anime titles that were extremly popular. Astro Boy, Kimba The White Lion and of course the hero with the extremly catchy theme song...Speed Racer. Speed Racer is an extreme race car driver with a heart of gold. He wants to prove that racing is not about money or power it is about loving what you do. So now Speed Racer has become a live action movie unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen.This movie promised to be either the biggest success of the Summer 2008 line up or the biggest bust. Unfortunatly I had a feeling it was going to fall into the bust catagory. The Wachowski Bros., directing already put up a major red flag because of all those people who hated how the Matrix saga ended. Still after seeing the trailers for this movie and knowing how the series was played out I still had high hopes for a good time in the theater. I went to see and I got exactly what I wanted. Speed Racer was just as goofy and funny with the rambling diologue the corny 60ish jokes and put on screen to be a live action anime. The special effects and cinemetography blew me away. After seeing Sin City and 300 it was amazing to see the same style of filming with wide open spaces and extremly colorful layouts. The soundtrack also kept that 1960's feel to it. All and all eventhough this film is over 2 hours long. You will only appreciate this movie if you know exactly what you are getting into. I knew what I wanted and it was worth every penny.

This may in fact be a record on my review of the new DCAU film `Batman: Year One'.There really isn't much to say about it, except for the fact that it does true Batman fans proud. This film is the comic come to life page for page, much like other films such as `Watchemen' & `300'. If you have read the graphic novel you will be impressed by pretty much everything. The colors, the dialogue and the feel of the film as a whole is the graphic novel. However, for first time DCAU film watchers, this may not be the right film to start with. Because there are many people out there that haven't picked up the comic book itself there is a lot of inner dialogue and a lot of cut scenes much like a comic book. It's got a great voice cast however, I wasn't too impressed with Ben Mackenzie as Batman, but Bryan Cranston as Jim Gordon was excellent. The film itself while like the comic is really short just over an hour, it doesn't have a solid ending. Most people may not appreciate that if they never read the book, but this story is only a small chapter in a much bigger story so pretty much it is what it is.`Batman: Year One' is one of the greatest Batman Stories ever told and bringing another Frank Miller story to life especially when it pays true tribute to the comic is always admirable. Still, it may not be as enjoyable as some of the films DCAU already has, but it is a good addition to the collection.FYI, don't forget to pick up the two disc edition if you are purchasing a DVD that way you get the extra features along with the new DC Showcase 'Catwoman'.

As far back as I can recall being a fan of anything related to comic books, the comic book film was a genre that was always wrapped in imperfection. While there were those who gave it praise there were those that felt it was a butchery of all that was pure in their world. I would have to say that excluding a very select few, I was never satisfied when it came to films adapted by comic books.Christopher Nolan, a director whom I had known about, but never truly new back in 2005 finally said it is time for the world of comic books to be take seriously. While X-MEN & Spider-Man had already began going down that path 'Batman Beings' not only perfected the evolution, but it also finally gave us a fantastic scripted, cast & homage to Bob Kanes' icon. Fast forward to 2012 and you have one of the most beautiful comic book franchises in history...yet at a price none the less.Everything about these three films is wonderful, but once again as someone who adores the new Marvel film universe, it is going to be very hard to bring the world of DC comics to the big screen. Superman and Batman seem to be the only ones that any director or writer wants to tackle and now with how real and dark that Nolans 'trilogy is it is going to be even harder to bring heroes like Wonder Woman, The Flash and yes even a good Green Lantern sequel to the big screen. Still, with Zack Snyder tackling the Superman franchise and a Justice League film on the horizon in 2015 I have a feeling that it can be done. The three Dark Knight films of course are wonderful the massive cast that was gathered for these films are perfect, Christian Bale was the perfect Bruce Wayne and it is about time that was done correctly. Heath Ledger (RIP) wowed me as the Joker and as a fan of Anne Hathaway, I adored her as Catwoman. This is a film experience unlike any other and they will be treasured for years to come. I am just so happy that when I have kids of my own and they are old enough to learn about Batman, along side the Animated Series and the Adam West film these will be films I will be excited and proud to share with them.

I am always excited when a new Bruce Timm project is on the way. Whenever a new one is released on DVD the first thing I do after I watch the feature is watch the preview for the next one. When `Green Lantern: First Flight' was released I could not wait to see what `Superman/Batman: Public Enemies' was all about. I will be brief I pre-ordered the movie exactly one day after I saw the preview.I am always excited to see a Superman and Batman crossover because there is such a great lineage of stories when these two heavy hitters collide. They are so similar and yet so different at the same time and sometimes you don't even know if they are pals or want to kill each other. The premise of Public Enemies is a pretty easy to follow story. Pulled right from the Joef Loeb story, Lex Luthor manages to become president when the world is pretty much in chaos. Doing so, he manages to bring the world back to stability and manages to hire an interesting secret service. Led by the patriotic Captain Atom, Black Lightning, Power Girl and other well known heroes are now working to keep America safe. Unfortunately they didn't notice the country sized kryptonite meteor heading towards Earth. Luthor, as president feels now is a great time to finally get Superman so he blames the meteor on him and sets a one billion dollar bounty to bring Superman to justice. Now the most powerful hero is on the run from heroes and villains alike and the only person who believes him and knows how to set things right is none other than Batman.This movie has a lot of great elements, but there are a few problems with it as well. The major flaw in this film is plot. The story while it is fun to watch there are a few parts that really don't make much sense. For people who love these movies, but don't read the comic books they probably have no idea who some of the characters are. The graphic novel which this film is based on has a few major plot points removed which are essential to the story. This problem is linked to another flaw. `Public Enemies' is way too short and due to time constraints is why we have these gaping holes in the story. This is actually the shortest of all the DC Animated movies running at a shameful 67 minutes. I mean I know that this movie was all about the action and it was win with a side of awesome sauce I think the movie would have given justice if it had been at least 90 minutes. The positives on the other hand make the negatives tolerable. The first plus is the animation style. What I love the most about the DC Animated projects is when they base their films directly on graphic novel stories they try pay homage to the comic art through the animation. `Justice League: New Frontier' was the first one to do so and like it `Superman/Batman: Public Enemies' pretty much took the characters from the comic and brought them right to the TV as the big, buffed muscle on muscle powerhouses they are in the book. It just made the action sequences so much more awesome when you saw Superman or Batman throw a punch you pretty much said `Yea...they can hit that hard'. The other plus was the voice cast. With the success of the 3 part Worlds Finest episodes of STAS it was only right to bring Clancy Brown, Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy back. They have worked together for so long and their chemistry is incredible. Of course my favorite thing about this film was it was an in your face, knock`em out the box slugfest. Every second a new adversary and some of the most intense action I had seen since the final episode of JLU.Once again Bruce Timm and company do it again bringing us a fun film. Still, while there has been so much success with this one and its predecessors there are a still some kinks that need to be worked out. I know there are plenty more films to make and who knows which story they will choose next. The next project `Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths' is definitely a make or break, just because of the history that this film is based on. They are really anticipating this one to be their best, and I don't think they would try to disappoint.End of Book 1

So we all thought that reality TV was on its way out the door and then came `Jersey Shore'. That only meant one thing had to be done...Drawn Together had to make a comeback! Thus, what we loyal and sick minded fans got was our long awaited `Drawn Together' movie.Now, if you are a fan who bought the Uncensored Season DVD's the first few minutes may not be as enjoyable because you have already seen how far this show can go. I have to say with the other adult cartoons that have been given their own movies, Drawn Together may in fact be the best one. The writers really did all they could to put together an offensive gem, getting the whole cast back and giving the fans all the jokes they love one last time. Still, the most impressive part happens to be the plot itself. It was a great way to pick up where the show left off and give these wonderful characters a real send off. Seth McFarlane plays the role of a new enemy, which may be one of the cleverest of offenses toward international politics . The story even gives us great character development of the Jew Producer. In the end you might actually love the guy after all the dumps he took on the DT gang.While there are a few major differences such as the fact that the movie is done in flash, to me it wasn't a major issue. The acting and the story of this movie were just as funny as the series itself. If you loved the series as much as I did you will barely even notice any serious changes. The special features are great as well. My favorite would have to be the minisodes. These are perfect for a first time viewer of anything Drawn Together. But, truth be told you really should watch the series before you tackle the movie. The opening title sequence of the movie to me was my favorite part. While it really has nothing to do with the movie itself it just gives you a little in your face DT 101. I don't want to spoil it for you neither do I want to spoil the surprise you get during the end credits. You will just have to see them for yourself.So grab a seat and hold on to whatever you feel most comfortable gripping and prepare for one last hysterical romp for those 8 lovable characters you quote in public every day of your life.

Wall Street was a film that captured the late 1980s world of finance. It exposed how the rich were getting richer and how they are doing all they could to prevent from getting caught. Years later Oliver Stone, who has kinda been struggling in making a good movie went back to his roots and gave us 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'This follow-up is not as great as the first one, but as a person who has a career in finace and knew about what was going on in the economy from 2008 until now it was a great thing to see it all incorporated into this film. The cast is what saves this movie. Michael Douglas gives a great performance returning as Gordon Gecko. Shia LeBouf is great, Josh Brolin is deliciously evil and Carey Mulligan is amazing. I am still waiting to see people finally realize just how great she is.If you are a fan of the first one chances are you will accept this sequal for what it is. Not as great as the first one, but it still follows the origonal quite well.

I was very curious to see if there was ever going to be a movie that would beat the record that Titanic has held for over ten years. The funny thing is I had a feeling that it would be another film from James Cameron. If there is one movie that had this nation a-buzz around the end of 2009 it was the imaginative grandeur of Avatar. This film had major critics to the average movie watcher going bonkers over almost everything it offered. Still, this movie fan has a great deal to say about this one.I have to give James Cameron some credit to his sci-fi epic. Giving us some of the greatest sci-fi action films in Aliens and Terminator, after Titanic it was only fitting for him to return to his fantasy roots. One of things that have been mentioned about Avatar was that it was an idea that Cameron had dating all the way back to 1995, that's even before Titanic was even released! You have to give a guy props when he says I have this great idea for a movie, but the technology has to catch up with the idea. Even dating back to 1999 we had seen George Lucas, The Wachoski Bros, Zack Snyder and Sam Raimi give some of the most visually stunning films of the decade. Yet, Cameron still felt his epic was not ready. Then suddenly the thought of brining movies back to the theaters in 3-D must have officially nailed it and James Cameron had started getting to work. It was a good idea to keep the public waiting for Avatar because the creatures and the landscapes were like Lord of the Rings on an acid trip. Everything was so original and so imaginative it was as if you walked into a dream. The action sequences were fluid and perfect; however there were a few flaws. While the technology of using digital characters has reached a climax, to the point where we are completely eliminating actors there is still a great deal of work to on using digital characters for slow, emotional segments in film. I feel that the animation was a little stiff and sometimes broken. I saw a much better performance from Andy Sirkis in Two Towers and I am sure a lot of people can agree. Yet I digress, Avatar came and it was graciously accepted in its entire imaginative wonderment. It was a movie that has been seen in all theaters 3-D and non and average fan has seen it in theaters at least 3 times! It went far beyond Titanic shattering every box office record and now with its DVD release it will no doubt shatter more records in the coming months. With that all said, it brings me to the real meat of this review. The only question I have had all this time after seeing it myself and seeing the overall reaction. Was Avatar really THAT good?I have been a fan of sci-fi fantasy films for many years, since my first Disney film at age 3. Ever since I saw Star Wars at age 9 this genre of film has been my utmost favorite. So Avatar for me was a movie I was actually NOT interested in seeing when I had first heard it was being released. Over time the hype was beginning to take me. Through many trailers and reading about the back story of how this movie came into existence I was sold. Just because to have put so much effort into getting this story to the big screen, it was something I had to witness. I walked out of the theater after about 3 hours amazed, but confused. No, I did not have the same reaction I did after seeing films like Spider-Man 3 or the DaVinci Code. That reaction being 3 hours of my life was stolen and I will never get them back. Still, even after seeing it almost 5 months ago I am wondering what all the fuss was about? I have to say that the special effects were mind blowing and as said earlier `like walking into a dream.' Well, the funny part is the blend of action and drama I felt was so uneven that the slow parts threw me into major dead spots. At one point I had actually fallen asleep! Yes, I stress that point...I FELL ASLEEP! I am not trying to bash this film in any way, but I wonder if Cameron actually took the time to revise his script? Unless I missed something entirely because I know I slept for less than ten minutes, there were just so many things missing in that movie. The character development was also extremely weak. I mean there was a decent amount of story linked to Jake Sully the main hero. Still, what about all the back story of the supporting cast? I mean there were just major dead points in the movie where Sully's Avatar was walking through the Pandora forest. We all knew who the enemies were in the movie, but why were they, and what made them such evil people. The main military officer had those 3 scars on his face, how did he get them? Was it an old phantom wound or something he received through his work on Pandora? What about the Navi in general, what is their story and why is James Cameron making a sequel and not a prequel? I feel that Cameron really focused more on the special effects and not enough on plot. Also the acting was dreadful! I almost gagged a few times with how pathetic some of the dialogue was. Apparently the AFI agrees with me because that movie while being nominated for a great deal of Oscars barley received any.Still, what angered me the most about this movie was the message that was sent. It is one of those saw that before done that before deals. To replace American Indians or any group of people that has suffered in world history with digital blue people is a major insult in my eyes. To witness a take on true peoples plight for the purposes of just making billions to sell movie tickets is a true disgrace and always has been. Now, take a movie like Schindler's List, which I am sure many are going to bring up after reading this review. Yes, it is a story about the Holocaust, yes it was a movie that made Stephen Spielberg money, but the presentation on telling the story that in a dark time in history there was actually a good person who felt something had to be done is a true tribute and a gift. The movie while depressing was well acted and really gave us an incredible actor in Liam Neason. I feel however that there is another message in Avatar that is extremely overshadowed. It is the dangers of online gaming. In a world where technology overruns us and we are totally dependent, many of us use it as an escape from reality. In that moment we forget about the world we live in and how it runs. We lose sleep we don't eat properly and some people get so caught up in the game they don't even leave the house to socialize. Things like this cause people get so caught up in a false reality which can lead to serious mental and physical issues. Sometimes it can even lead to death. I do proudly play World of Warcraft, but one of the things I am happy to say is I can pull myself away from the game when I have to. I have a full time job a well maintained social life and maintain myself in current events. I give myself one day a week to just shut the world out so I can be alone with my thoughts and dedicate my time to my hobbies. Using online gaming in that manor can result in lowering stress levels and blood preassue and I have the medical records to prove it. In Avatar Jake would be so anxious to go back into his Avatar until the very end of the film where he actually became the Avatar! Is this to say it is ok to keep playing on YOUR Avatar because you live in a world of infinite lives and nothing can ever harm you? To that, I say shame on you. Yes, the real world is a bad place, but only you have the tools necessary to make it better and there are so many stories from celebrities to the average human being that were able to crawl from the destitute and find happiness. Probably one of the most heartwarming is the story of J.K. Rowling the author of Harry Potter. I won't go into any details, but if you Wiki her, her story will melt your heart.In summation, I do feel that Avatar is one of the movies you should see before you die, whether you love it or hate it, the ball will be in your court. In my opinion, like many of James Cameron's other films I have seen I can only say this. I'm glad I saw it, but I will probably never see it again.

They called it the 'Dream' project, the 'Big' one. So big in fact that this is a review of part 1 of this new DCAU film.'The Dark Knight Returns' was the comic that changed the comic book world forever with a story that was so brash and dark, the camp and classic good vs. evil was shattered. I always knew that there would be an animated film down the road and now it is finally here. I made sure to read the first two parts of the entire comic before I purchased this film and it was good to do so. The film adaption of this story is so beautiful with a few small subtile differences which are barely noticiable especially if you haven't read the origonal material in a while. The changes don't destroy the film at all because they stuck very close to it and really made it work. The voice cast was great. It took a while for me to warm up to Peter Weller voicing Batman, because I know that Kevin Conroy and even Bruce Greenwood would have been able to voice Batman in this film just as well. Still, he did a great job and the rest of the cast inclucing Ariel Winter, Gary Anthony Williams, Michael McKeon all contributed wonderfully. The action is just as intense in the film. The punches are earthshattering the faceoffs are hard hitting and intense and nothing is held back in the slightest. One thing I love about WBs DCAU is the fact that these are real fans putting together shows and movies with the comic fan in minds. Making sure it is something that makes the viewer happy, but also seeing how far they can push the bar in the world of animation as well as showing that animation can be for adults as well as kids.Of course, 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 1' will not be perfect until the second half is released, but I am definitely going to be one of the first in line to pick it up and complete the story. I am actually hoping that this will not be the last of the 'dream/big' projects in the DCAU film library. I would love Crisis on Infinate Earths', 'Blackest Night' and especially 'Kingdom Come'. Still, after seeing this film released I have a feeling there are more treats in store for us fans.

The Coen Bros. have pretty much made their mark on film. They have been nominated for best picture for 'Fargo', created one of the greatest cult classics in 'The Big Lebowski and got Oscar gold with 'No Country For Old Men' The Coen Bros are the epitome of originally and dry comedy and know how to use their actors both well known and unknown. Then there is 'Burn After Reading'. The Coen Bros. do it again, great cast, very dry humor and pure originality. Still, with 'Burn After Reading' it's very hard to finish that movie satisfied, because you wonder if it made any sense at all.From what I was able to make out of it John Malcovich brilliantly portrays a recently fired government agent, who decides to write a book. His information, somehow ends up in the hands of two yokel gym instructors played brilliantly by Francis McDormand and Brad Pitt (In my opinion this is his greatest comedic role since True Romance) Now the movie has become a game to retrieve the disc of information while everyone is sleeping with everyone and everyone is looking over their shoulders thinking someone is watching them. Even in the end when this case is brought to light to the head of this mysterious organization which is pretty much in the background of the whole film he can't even figure out what the hell is going on.I had high hopes for this movie. I did feel the cast did a great job, which is why I gave this movie two stars. I have become a big fan of Tilda Swinton since I saw her in Narnia. I feel she has great potential to become a real legend in her field. She already won an Oscar along side George Clooney. George Clooney, I really didn't get in this movie. I mean he knows how to work his role, but in this film I really didn't understand what he was there for. This movie itself just keeps you asking questions and probably the biggest question of all you will have is...how in God's name did I manage to sit through this movie? I would just watch The Big Lebowski again, at least with that movie The Dude abides.

There many movies that have depicted the world of war. The past has given us a very glorified, Hollywood picture. Movies from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to 'Inglorious Basterds' have show us good vs. evil, fancy dialogue etc. War is always taken out of context in cinema, but there are very few that give us something real.'The Hurt Locker', now known as the best picture of 2009 is one of those movies that is not bent on giving us a glorious picture, rather they strip war down to its true, gritty roots and in this movie we see the mental anguish that soldiers go through in modern day war. This movie takes us into the lives of a battalion that has been sent into Iraq to patrol the streets in search of terrorists and suicide bombers. In the middle of their rotation they are given a new squad leader that is a bit off color when it comes to the seriousness of their cause. He is unruly and at times treats it like a game. While some would consider characteristics such as this offensive because of the real people out there today fighting this war, there is some realism to those actions. There are people that have gotten so wrapped up in this war they try to turn into something else just to keep going as they battle the enemy. The film is very tense and at times not for the faint hearted. Still, it is not suppose to be war is real and war can make you feel all sorts of emotions you never thought you had inside you. One of the things that I appreciated about 'The Hurt Locker', was the fact that not all Arab people are depicted as bad, and that those who happen to be good in nature are thrown into terrorist acts against their will and sometimes they lose their own lives.'The Hurt Locker', is not meant to be a cinematic legend in its field, nor was it made to be one of the greatest films of all time. I feel this movie was created to send a very important message about the war we are currently fighting and war in general. We have brave men and women who fight for freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield. More importantly, it shows how all that these souls want to make sure that in the end they are able to go home.

Ever since I was 3 I have been a fan of Batman. I started with the Superfriends and the Adam West show all the way to the awesome worlds of Bruce Timm and Christopher Nolan. Now with the most anticipated film of 2008 on the way in 'The Dark Knight' Bruce Timm decided to join his world and Nolans' world with 'Batman: Gotham Knight' This film bridges 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' showing Batman's rise to legendary status as well as keeping an eye out of the other major characters, heroic and villanous.This film does not bring the viewer the familiar Batman to the screen. It is something completly different that has never been done in the superhero media. Yes there have been many depictions of famous superheroes in the style of Manga and other anime styles, but in print never moving picture. I think that is why many people are giving this movie a very mixed review. The style of anime is a cut above the american traditional 2-D/3-D animation. The animation is original and stories make the characters much more complex. Sometimes the line drawn between good and evil or hero and villian is washed away due to dark heroes and villians with no intentions of mass genocide or world domination. The most familiar thing you see in this film is Kevin Conroy doing what he does best and eventhough it would have been cool to see Christian Bale in this role I was glad that Kevin returned.I say this movie should be seen because it is so fresh and different. I always enjoy when people move a character out of his or her comfort zone. While this film isn't as good as Mask of the Phantasm or Return of the Joker (the other Bruce Timm Batman Movies), I thought it was well put together and I am eagerly awaiting the next Warner Premire film which is Wonder Woman.

Rarely does a film get released with such anticipation. Not the kind of anticipation you would get from a Harry Potter or Star Wars film. Every now and again a film about a real point in time that caused a major change in history is released and since the new millennium none were priased as `The Help'This is a film based on a fantastic book about women growing up in the deep south in the early 1960s and the African American women that helped them in their everyday lives. Yet, in this time there was only a select few that knew that times were changing. In this film that person was enveloped in a girl named Skeeter, who knew there was an important story to tell that these Black women were afraid to tell, but had no idea what it would do to two races of people.I was fortunate to read this novel and I have to say that this was an incredible film adaption. The ensemble cast was amazing and the story is so heartwarming and uplifting. While this film does revolve around females it is by no means a `chick flick'. It is a story about hope and learning to step up and take a chance for what you believe in. Even if you have no idea what the consequences will be. `The Help is a great film that tells the story about a time in American history that is not really touched upon in such depth and this movie really brings out the humanity in the time and it is a true classic.

When it comes to the world of animation, creative juices go in every direction. Still, in the end the finished product is going to be the make or break of the outcome when giving your gift to the public. Unfortunately when it comes to animation it is normally associated with family and child appeal. At this point in animations history unless your work relates to immaturity or pop culture humiliation it will be very seldom and an adult audience will find interest.With all that said we are introduced to the film `9'. The backdrop is a post apocalyptic world where the human race was destroyed by man made machines. Now, we can immediately point a finger and say rip off, until we are introduced to the main characters which happen to be man made rag dolls. 9 is the newest one who awakes long after the battle is over. He has no idea where he is or why is he here. All he knows is that he holds something important and the friends he meets along the way help him piece together his past as well as his purpose and what he must do to rebuild the future.Shane Acker, the director of `9' originally had these characters in an academy award nominated short film. To spread this story out into a 90 minute film was a challenge and in my opinion broke new ground at the same time is still incomplete. The first major positive without a doubt had to be the concept. For animation a drama is not something you usually see. The plot falls on the lines of Don Bluth story telling like `An American Tale' or `Titan AE'. Those films have the same first major flaw, which is the attempt to make an animated drama non child oriented. While `9' does have a PG-13 rating, it is because of the scary cyberpunk like machines that run amuck and of course the fact that characters die. However, that brings the second flaw which is the lack of dialogue. As much as Shane Acker wants his worlds to be based upon visuals, the movie going public needs dialogue due to its dying attention span. The dialogue was very well done because of its stellar voice cast. It really brought those rag dolls heart and made them believable. What I loved the most about this movie was the whole mystery of the discovering the reason why these characters were here. In the beginning you knew who was creating them, but you didn't know why he was. In the end when all is brought into fruition you reflect on everything you saw and are left in complete awe. That is what makes great story telling.I found this movie very interesting and the fact that a mastermind like Tim Burton did gave me an urge to see it. It probably won't be a movie I would see again, but I would definitely be interest in future films of this nature. This is surly a first step to a whole new world of animated storytelling.

Boston Legal is a show that was always outlandish in nature. Putting together a phenomenal cast into original situations. With the fourth season ready to go it looked like it was time to stir things up.Out of nowhere a new face enters the front in the form of the distinguished and off beat humorous John Laroquette. Carl Sack is the new hall monitor of Crane Poole & Schmidt and he is here to make these hallowed halls look like a real law firm. Well, it looks like Denny Crane and Alan Shore will have something to say about it. This season is not as light hearted as the seasons of this show in the past. This season brought a lot more depth to the friendships of these characters. Denny and Alan's friendship gets as heartfelt as it can be because Alan and all those around him are noticing that Denny's altzheimers is starting to take slight yet noticeable effects. Alan suddenly starts to conquer many of his fears from clowns to extremly aggresive ex-girlfriends. Even Jerry has become a major part of this family, not as someone who is getting into trouble, but as a true dignified laywer.This show has yet to disappoint me, but now unfortunatly this show has ended in 2009. There is one more season for us to enjoy, but for now this 4th season is one to be savored.

'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo', is one of the most talked about book seires these past few years and after reading the first instalment I understand why. It is a captivating white knuckle thriller that really breaks all the rules with bold and sometimes disturbing moments that just keep reading. So when they announced that an American version of the already made Sweedish film was on the way of course I was ready to go.The director David Fincher already was one of my favorite directors and I love his work and of course this time he directed another winner. While there were some differences from the transition of book to film it was a movie that was just as gripping and bold as the pages. The cast was great and I knew that Rooney Mara would do a great job portraying Lisbeth, even getting an academy award nomination. Daniel Craig can do no wrong and even Robin Wright supprised me a little in the role she played as well.I am a bit upset that this film didn't get the box office notice that it truly deserves, but at the same time a film that deals with some very debated topics is not one that the collective film going public would agree upon. I was happy that certain moments as graphic as the pages mentioned did show up on the film. I really hope that the universal concensious will not prevent the next two chapters from hitting the big screen and I hope that Fincher stays on to direct along with the cast and hopefully Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the soundtrack.

One of the greatest story tellers Akira Kurosawa is done justice with the retelling of one of his best works. 'Seven Smaurai' is the story of a villiage being enslaved by ruthless bandits forcing them to work the land in servitude. Their only hope is to venture out and find a band of Samurai. However, it is a process that will take much time because the Samurai are a dying breed not as honerable and noble as they were. Through much hardship and obstacles 7 worthy men are chosen by their pure hearts and honor and come together to wage a war on the bandits and reclaim their place in history and in the hearts of the innocent.Enter 'Samurai 7' The story is re-told through the use of brilliant animation and set in a post apokalyptic future. The samurai have become common theives or sold their souls to become mighty steel machines to serve the imperial city. It's an incredible blend of classic Japanese story telling with a sci-fi twist. It's a specticle that makes all kind of emotions come out. It does move a little slow, but the character development as well as the story really sucks you making you wonder what will happen next.'Samurai 7' has become a critically accalimed show by many critics and newspapers. It has become a cult classic in the anime mainstream and has even been broacsted on american television. If you are into great stories that are not always in your face action this might be for you.

Suppose you lived in a world that possessed the technology to invade others dreams? What if that power allowed you to dive into the deepest depths of the human mind? From Christopher Nolan's mind comes Inception.This is the story of a man whose job is to invade people's dreams in order to plant ideas into others minds and take them for the purposes of business. Yet, his history of his work is much deeper than what people know. He now has to take on one final task with a new recruit and his best team to find one of the most important ideas that can change the modern world.This film is probably one of the most well put together that came out this year. The actors chosen all played their roles beautifully. Joseph Gordon Levitt was probably the best of the bunch as he always seems to astound me with all his recent work. What can be said about DiCaprio that hasn't these past few years? Ellen Page always brings her "A" game and this time it is no different. Still, this movie is not going to appeal to everyone. This movie really makes you think, and unless you pay close attention you are surly to get lost. I would realistically give Inception 3 stars just because it doesn't appeal to a mass audience. Still, the movie is well acted and well executed and it is definitely worth seeing

What makes a super-hero in myth? It can be anything from a landmark moment in a characters past or a discovery of a power that no other mortal posesses. You know the history and all the iconic names that go along with those origins, but what if you were just an ordinary person who felt the need to just help the innocent and just go out there and kick some evil ass? Well that is pretty much what Kick-Ass did.Kick-Ass is the story of an average comic loving nerd that suddenly felt two things needed to be done. Evil needed to be punished and he needed to get laid. So after many attempts he finally became the green and yellow scuba suit wearing hero 'Kick-Ass' What he didn't count on was that being a super-hero wasn't going to be such a cake walk. On his journey he encounters others who are out there vanquishing evil and it is not such an easy job.'Kick-Ass' as much as I was anticipating to see this movie ended up surpasing my expectations. I had never seen a movie that was as hystercially funny turn into such a slap-happy over the top gore-fest with some extremly serious moments as well. it was as if Quinten Tarantino directed Superbad. The acting was amazing and every actor gave 110%. I also loved the fact that there was a female character that girls could admire...not neceserally look up to because well Chloe Mortez is only 13 years old. Still, this movie is incredible it has huge laughs mind blowing fight scenes and it just oozes with awesomeness. And hey, how many times and the success of a movie based on a graphic novel cause the authors of the first to write a sequel and base a sequel film on it?

I have never reviewed a Pixar film on Amazon just yet, but their 10th feature `Up' had to be. Pixar, since Toy Story has spit out one hit after another bringing a whole new generation of legendary Disney Characters. While every single one of them has been incredible `Up' just stands out because it is unlike any of its Pixar predecessors.This is the second film from Pixar to be given a PG rating since The Incredibles. While The Incredibles was more based around comic books and superhero action the first few minutes of Up are very adult oriented. There are extremely real elements that lead us to the main characters adventure, but the previous one he had was real life. It is a beautiful sequence with no dialogue, but a score to show a husband and wife sharing the happy times and the devastating ones, one of them being the loss of a loved one. Even with no words it is so heartfelt and full of emotion it is just something that a young audience might not understand and the scene where Carl assaults a construction worker is also a moment that is very hard to explain to a very young person. After that the story changes gears to a rip roaring hysterical adventure. The cast works so well together especially bringing two legends in Edward Asner and Christopher Plumber. Everyone will love Russell, the eager young explorer who seeks adventure, but there is also more depth to this character that again reflects real live issues such as parent separation. Of course there is pure Disney magic in this film especially in the animals. This time when there are talking dogs, `Up' uses technology to make them speak instead of a traditional imaginative talking animal. That was a stroke of genius making is actually believable that someone can create a device to make an animal speak and still keep its own natural characteristics.Up may be the best Pixar film to date although I love each and every one of them, this just stands out as a story that was trying to get as real as it could. I do feel that if someone tied that many balloons to a house it could fly. So find a way to see this film it will truly lift your spirits and melt your heart. Oh, if you start yelling `Squirrel' at the top of your lungs no one will think you're out of your mind.

In 2002 when Sam Raimis' 'Spider-Man' came to the big screen I was blown away with how far film making had come to finally give us an accurate depiction of a comic book hero. When 'Spider-Man 3' came out however, I was looking for a bucket to puke in. So now, after many years and rumors we have...new director, new cast, new Spider-Man. I for one feel that this 'Amazing' Spider-Man...is not so amazing.Here is what works in this film, the acting. It is a great cast, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone & Rhys Iffans did a wonderful job in their roles. The special effects, you can tell how far we have come even though the original's effects where truly ahead of the time. The story...no. Way too dark too many people crying every 15 seconds it just didn't work for me. People say that Spider-Man is a dark story, but darn it I don't see it. Every depiction of Spider-Man I have seen just has never been so gloomy. Even in the comics while there are very complex stories they are always a fun read. I didn't find 'The Amazing Spider-Man' fun. Now, of course there is no turning back which a sequel on the horizon again with a good cast and a new villain that has yet to make his big screen debut and will I see it...I may. I just wish that when you try it the first time you shouldn't ruin what you have. 'Spider-Man 3' should have been re-shot to actually be good and personally I felt Topher Grace got shafted. Or if you are chosen to play a character and you are terrified of being type-casted then do us all a favor and say no up front. I'm talking to you Magurie! and by the way...what have you done since you left that franchise that was relevant anyway hmmm?'Will this new franchise do well yes, and I may just grow to love it, but as of now I am just bitter because of all these re-boots and re-hashes and would just like Marvel to take back the rights and incorporate this fun loving character into the Marvel film universe.

Throughout the years we have watched one of the most noble and pure hearted men grow from nave child to fierce warrior. Now we reach the final season of Dragon Ball GT. After handling evil in many shapes and forms, Goku has to defeat his deadliest of all opponents, himself!After the defeat of Baby and the jump to Super Saiyan 4, all Goku and the gang want to do is relax. Sorry guys you're not out of the woods just yet! Goku has to first take down a few old foes just to find out that the Dragon Balls which has relied upon to bring peace and good to the world have turned against him. Now the balls have broken and each one has released its own evil Shadow Dragon. Each one is stronger than the next and Goku doesn't even know if Super Saiyan 4 can take them down.While this show has been dumped on by many loyal fans I have to say the ending of this show was quite impressive. Considering that there was only one more season to work with the writers really tried to cram it all in and tie up all the lose ends. Many events and characters from Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z play a role in these final few episodes so you will be pretty surprised how it is all incorporated together. I love the fact that after all the adventures that the Z gang has had over the years it was Goku himself that almost cost every one certain doom. In the end of all things Goku makes a Frodo like exit from the world realizing that he is too dangerous to be a part of this world and this time he meant it for good. I liked how the show was just given a strait up ending in Goku's exit and in the end the whole story was really put together quite nicely. I feel that GT is a very important series to watch especially since Dragon Ball Z really didn't seem to be the perfect ending, but GT definitely got it right and the in the end I was satisfied.

You have been patient so now it is time for the Z Gang to get back into action! After a crazy mishap at the World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku and the gang end up joining forces with the most powerful being in the universe. He is here on a mission to destroy a horrible creature that has been dormant under the Earth for a million years. His name is Majin Buu and although he looks like a big pink ball and acts like an infant, he is heartless and lethal. Goku and his friends will face a force like never before and it's not going to be easy to survive.This chapter of the DBZ saga is probably the most emotional. It is probably the most well written out of all the sagas in DBZ. This season how ever is not for the faint hearted. The characters while they may be strong, will suffer through a lot of loss due to the death of loved ones. Though it maybe the darkest chapter, there is a lot of new and incredible things to experience. This season gives us the long awaited rematch between Goku and Vegeta. This time they are both super charged and ready to rumble like never before. The creation of Gotenks from the legendary fusion dance is introduced to us as well. Probably the best treat of them all is watching Goku possibly reaching his limits as he powers up to Super Saiyan 3!Still, with all these incredible new plateaus our heroes have reached, will it still be enough to take down Majin Buu and save the world?! With one season left to go in this legendary show we will soon find out.

The Bravery is a band that stands out it yet at the same time they don't. Pretty much because this new wave of alternative music is being used by so many different bands out there today. Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinad and Keiser Cheifs just to name a few. However if you are a fan of this quintent their sophmore attempt is nothing to be sneezed at.The Bravery have matured in their musicianship as well as their style. The tracks flow evenly together and the stlye is a little different from the first album. The take on the sound leads towards pop bands from the early to mid 1960's. Sounds from bands like The Beach Boys, early Beatles as well as some psychedelia like Strawberry alarm clock. All and all if you are a fan of this sound/group its definitely worth the time listening to if not buying.

Ranma Saotome has overcome some pretty tricky obstacles in the past three seasons. Surely he can over come a brand new principal from Hawaii...right? The fourth season of Ranma ? really lives up to his subtitle `Outta Control', so much that it leaves you confused at the end.I enjoy the crazy antics that Ranma dished out so far, but as far as plot goes this new batch of episodes was a bit on the weak side. There are a few great parts in this season. The story where Ranma loses his powers is probably the most heartfelt. It really brings his feelings out especially to Akane. There is also an episode where Ranma comes clean to Shampoo and tells her he really doesn't love her (Don't expect Shampoo to take that so easily). Still, there are episodes that make you wonder why. Shampoo gets engaged to a giant cat; Tatewake Kuno dates Akane's sister Nabiki, crazy Azusa and yes, even Ranma! The other problem with this season is that there are way too many one hit wonder characters. Examples include, The Poker King, Hatta and the new school Coach (who leaves at the end of his debut episodes.Don't skip this season altogether, because there is plenty of wackiness, laughs and fun. I just hope you can handle it all!*Recomended Episode: Extra, Extra! Kuno & Nabiki: Read All About It!*

Bruce Timm has taken the next step in his already acclaimed career. After spending so much time on creating the television sensation of the DC Animated Universe it was obviously time to move to the next stage. Superman Doomsday, created in the tradition of Batman:Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker is exactly where we are heading.Superman Doomsday while not entirley accurate is a film version of one of the most shocking and most talked about moments in the history of Comic Books. The Death of Superman from the arrival of Doomsday all the way to the triumphant return of the Man of Steel brought an entire world of fans to their knees and many a tears were shead when one of the most beloved characters in pop culture went through such a dark and turbulant story. Bruce Timm really tried to capture the main meat of this story and really holding true to the main points of this entire saga.Most of the complaints are the battle between Superman and Doomsday is too short and very shallow. I being 10 years old reading that issue remebered it as being just that nothing but one issue and a huge slugfest leading up to Superman's death. The four supermen before the return of the real one. The evil superman was pretty much a conglomorate of all four of them just leaving the viewer not as confused as he or she could have been epscially since probably most of the these viewers didn't actually follow the real story in print.The possitives of this film was the fact that Bruce Timms story telling didn't hold back. Given a PG-13 rating allowed the story's violent and emotional parts be hard to watch and times hard to bear as it was to read the story. The animation as well as the voice actors used can go either way. I understood after watching the special features that this movie was made in this style to capture the mood and feel of the origional story and the voice actors used in the origional shows may not have been able to really show the emotions or feelings needed for such powerful moments seen in the movie. My real beef in this story was the part that was based on Funeral for a Friend. I hated the fact that this movie only featured Superman and Superman characters at the funeral. After a show like Justice League, people really should have seen the impact that the death of Superman had on the other heroes of the DC universe. Having them on screen for just a brief moment would have made the funeral alot more emotional.If you are a fan of the DC universe this movie is a must to add to your collection. It definitely helps you forget Braniac Attacks and shows us that this is only the begining of great things to come in the DC animated universe.

Seinfeld was one of the greatest shows because it was a show about nothing. Now, take those 4 characters and turn them into 4 teenaged anime girls. Give them a few teenager oriented topics and school and you get the hysterical show 'Lucky Star'.Lucky Star started on the topic of how to eat a pastry the right way. While I sat watching that I was officially a fan. This is such a great show. While some of the topics may not be towards everyone's liking, it is just a funny show. Each character is unique and funny in their own way and it just keeps the show interesting from beginning to end even though nothing really exciting happens! There are no crazy battles, no heavy emotional stories...none of that. All it is just teenagers being teenagers....with a little stereotypical anime thrown in. It is a great show and I would highly recommend if you are looking for something different in the anime world.

A known fact about Hayao Miyazaki is his love for classic planes. In 1992 he brought his love of planes to life in the high flying adventure 'Porco Rosso'. This is the tale of Marco Rossillini. Once a proud Italian air force pilot,too proud for his own good which brought curse a on him. The curse, you guessed it turned him into a pig. Now a beloved outlaw constantly foiling the crimes of notorious air pirate gangs they have brought Porco his match in the egotistical American Jack Curtis. Now with a new enemy Porco has to stop being pig headed and have a little faith in his friends. Only then can he rise against Curtis and become a real airborne legend.I had been told this is one of the most beloved Studio Ghibli films, but unfortunatly it didn't really work for me. The voice acting was great having some legends like Michael Keaton and Brad Garret, who practically stole the show as Boss. It was the story that was just too simple for me. The begining and ending sequences are so much fun filled with amazing planes bright colors and hysterical moments, but there is really no meat in between the two. The only thing I did like was his origin and how he got the curse and all this talk about him being a pig was just a tad over done. Still, I am glad I got to see it and I would say it's a movie to see maybe you will have a better time watching it.

If you can try to believe it, there was a time when computers considered untouchable to the average person in this world. No one would have ever expected that these wondrous thinking machines would be a staple of the common house hold let alone be used for anything else than simple game programs. Suddenly in the early 1980s a film was announced and it was to be the first that ever delved into the concept that computers could be use to help make films through its own style of animation. That movie was Tron.Tron is a simple story starring the great Jeff Bridges who hacks his way into his old company's computer data base to retrieve evidence that ideas for successful computer games belonged him and not the man who forced him to leave. Little did he know that a program known as Master Control had been growing and hacking its own way into other databases to become the greatest most powerful program ever. Machines thinking on their own?! ,Who would have thought?! So the computer universe is given a visit from "The Dude" and a cult hit is born.This film for what it was for its time in incredible. I am blown away by what creative minds felt would be the next generation of film making. Mind you if you were born after 1996 you probably will not understand this film nor will you even believe that there was a time when computers that you see in Tron were considered `Advanced.' This film is not only a great ride, but it is a historical trip in understanding the pioneering of computer technology and how we got to where we are today. The plot is a little hard to get at times and the movie does move a bit slow. Still, Tron is a classic and a true wonder to behold

One thing that can be said about Batman is that his character as a whole has created a monster fan base. Part of that fan base that grew up with the Dark Knight has actually had the privilege to create some of his most memorable adventures. Bruce Timms' newest animated movie `Batman: Under The Red Hood' is one of the more recent Batman classics brought to us. What makes this story so special is that it was derived from one of the darkest stories in Batman's legacy, and that story revolved around the death of the second Robin. Historically the death of Jason Todd is known as `Batman's greatest failure'. What Under The Red Hood does is takes `A Death In The Family' and adds a whole new chapter. Deriving from the major elements it turns `Death' into a much larger story with an incredible epilogue. As much as I would have loved to s `A Death In The Family' brought to life, `Under The Red Hood' may in fact be the best Batman story the DCAU has offered us.The story that this film gives us takes place five years after the death of Jason Todd. Suddenly the crime lords of Gotham City have a new threat and he is this merciless vigilante known as Red Hood. His mission is to keep the mob in line and make sure that while their actions continue to flourish, they have to work under his rules. Because, if they step out of line, they die. Of course Batman leaps into action to try and take him down, but once he gets too close to this new threat his world will be shattered when he discovers who Red Hood truly is.This movie was such an incredible piece. It is definitely the darkest film up until this point, but it is such a well executed story. There are however a few negatives, but I will go with the positives first. What I loved about this film was the homage to the ending of `A Death In The Family'. While it is not as graphic as depicted on the pages of the comic, keep in mind that this film is rated PG-13. Still, they kept the actions taken and the dialogue intact and it is such a gripping scene to watch. That feeling that you get in that moment carries on all the way to the end of the film. The final showdown with Batman & Red Hood is incredible. I have never seen such passion and emotion thrown into one of these films up until now and I have to say that I had to re-watch that whole final scene, just because it was so well done. On that note the voice acting was perfect. Bruce Greenwood did a spot on job as Batman. I have to admit, there were points in the film where I couldn't even tell it was him because he sounded so similar to Kevin Conroy. What made Greenwood a better choice for this film was the passion in his voice especially when he raised his voice. Jensen Ackles was great as Red Hood. He started out just as a regular voice actor, but the scenes he has with Batman are so great. The final showdown he puts almost an Oscar worthy performance, I have to say I was enthralled. John DiMaggio took on the Joker. Now, I have to say that many people always hate when Mark Hammil isn't there, but let's face it with a movie as heavy as this one Mark Hammil's voice would just come of extremely cartoonish. Don't get me wrong in Phantasm and Return of the Joker he does a great job, but take a look at those movies in general and compare them to the setting of Red Hood. I promise you, you will understand why they used another actor. Still DiMaggio as a plus turns on that Mark Hammil Joker charm in this film, but the voice he brings is a darker, creepier Joker and it's a win for this film. The best voice would have to be Wade Williams as Black Mask. He brings sheer over the top villainy to Black Mask. It is one of those voices that just makes the character so evil you grin with delight at his madness. Black Mask was this guy that would get so high strung in two seconds he would punch through a brick wall.So, what are the faults of `Under The Red Hood?' It was too short. A movie of such grandeur should be more than 79 minutes. I don't know why Bruce Timm thinks that we have such short attention spans. There were so many great things thrown into this package that I felt there wasn't enough. An example would Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing. I could watch NPH perform in front of a brick wall for 3 hours and be entertained. He breathed great life into his character, but it would have been great just to see more action with him in it. The flashbacks of Jason Todd were great as well. I thought maybe it would have been a plus to throw some flashbacks of Dick Grayson as Robin maybe to see him depart from Batman or encounter him for the first time as Nightwing. Yet, I digress.`Under the Red Hood' is a great film, mostly because it revolves around the Robin character. Robin is a persona in DC comics that is always blasted by fans because of the camp of the silver age and the old Adam West show. Still, Robin is probably one of the most important characters because he brings a human side out in Batman. To see what Batman goes through when a hero that he trained becomes something he shouldn't be it just makes the Batman persona more of a legend, but more than that a hero with a heart. Also if you are planning to get this film on DVD, purchase the two disc edition, which features another DC Showcase short. This one features Jonah Hex, and since his movie bombed this will be all the Jonah Hex you need.

I like to really voice my opinon when it comes to movies I see and plan to own on dvd. The first Transformers film I had a great case to show that it was a good movie. Now we have the sequeal. Same director, same actors and a few new robots.Let me be as consice as I can. If you want to see a movie with a great plot, oscar worthy performaces and an ending that will make you leap out of your seat an applaud. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! PUT A RESTRAINING ORDER ON IT IF YOU HAVE TO! Here is the honest truth about 'Revenge of the Fallen' The acting is the worst I have seen since 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'. I use this movie by comparison for good reason. My intentions for seeing 'Revenge of the Sith' or any of the 3 recent installmets to the Star Wars franchise had nothing to do with the expectations of seeing a movie that was perfect with no equal. No, I just wanted to see a Star Wars movie and get closure I wanted seeing Anakin Skywalker finally become Darth Vader. By the way if you are a reader that had no idea that THAT was the outcome of Star Wars then I should personally slap you around for a bit before you climbed back under the stone you crawled out from for at least 20 years of your life. Now that I have gone completly off topic I will get back to my review. The real reason I wanted to see this highly anticipated Transformers sequel was to see sweet looking plains trains and automobiles turn in to awesome kick keister robots and signature Michael Bay explosions! Also while the plot is about as shallow as the local kiddie pool a true fan of the Transformers cartoon will get a real treat of plot devices from the orgional show. The movie is loud, fun and ficken awesome. Apparently the movie did it's job at the box office because they have green lit the third installment. So, a hit for Mr. Bay, LESS ACTING AND MORE ROBOTS PLEASE!

I quote Adriana Romano when she says: "When we get a new project we always want to make it better than the last" After a tremendous success with `Batman: Under The Red Hood' The DCAU gang presents us with not only a brand new movie, but the first official sequel in their line of made for DVD DC films. `Superman/Batman Apocalypse' is the sequel to the graphic novel and film of the same name (Superman/Batman: Public Enemies) I have to say that this one delivers on a scale like none of the previous films.Apocalypse starts right where Public Enemies left off with a brand new discovery in Gotham City, it a girl with powers that are quite familiar to a hero we know. Once discovered that this girl is in fact Superman's' cousin he feels a whole new responsibility besides just playing hero. Still, while she may look innocent Batman always has that little hair standing up in the back of his neck and he has all the right. In the shadows there is a dark presence that is always looking to hurt Superman at any second and this new found family may be the final breaking point.A lot of people were left dissatisfied with this new film because of the plot. While it is a Superman/Batman, Batman doesn't have much of a part in the story. Well if you are looking for instant gratification then yes you have all the right to be upset, but truth be told he is pretty much a presence throughout the whole film. He is the reason that leads to the chain of events with Darkseid, and the appearance of Wonder Woman, and he is pretty much the reason why Super girl tries so hard to break away from the fact that she has powers and that she is a possible threat. What really makes up for the lack of Batman's' face time is his one-liners. Batman never really gets an opportunity to be funny, so I loved the fact that some of his dialogue lets out a few belly laughs. What I loved the most about this story was the pace. I liked the fact that it was a story that was thought out and very deep in dialogue. The chemistry and feelings that the characters have for one another is done very well and the fact that they got some of the voice actors from the television series including Ed Asner as Granny Goodness was a huge positive. The action sequences in this film are probably some of the best I have ever seen. Even the fights that have multiple opponents are very crisp and easy to follow on screen. They are also very well choreographed some of the moves that I watched I don't think I have seen in a DCAU film before. It seems with every new movie there is just so much more effort put into the animation there are points you have no idea you are watching an animated film. Also there is a great surprise close to the end, which was definitely a little tease moment, just so the fans would know that Bruce Timm wouldn't let us down and always give us what we want.With every new film that gets released, the DCAU films just keep getting better and better. This year was probably the best because all 3 films that have been released were just a cut above in terms of story, acting and just sheer awesomeness. Pick up the 2 Disc editions on DVD so you get the 3rd DC Showcase of Green Arrow. I will say that it is definitely worth the extra cash because is it an action packed short, with great acting and humor.

I was not the biggest fan of Maroon 5 when they released their debut. After borrowing it from my sister I realized this band is much more than what their radio play gives them credit for. Now here is their sophmore attempt. After hearing the single 'Makes Me Wonder' I was very eager to pick this CD up. I loved the catchyness of the single as well as Maroon 5 once again bringing the classic 1970's funk/disco/soul sound back. When I bought this album I really didn't find it as good as I thought. Listening to the first 5 or so tracks it came off as nothing really fresh, but rather just more of 'Songs About Jane'. Yet, I ended up listening to the album strait through and second time, then a third time and so on and so forth. This album really is something fresh. Songs like 'Kiwi, 'Not Falling Apart' and Back At Your Door' are just a few of the tracks that really stand out. There is for some reason a bit of elements from early 80's new wave, like Depeche Mode, or the Police. If you listen to the keyboards I think you may just hear the same. This new album is worth the chance it really does grow on you and I think it may just be better than Maroons debut and probably of the best albums to be released this year.

First off, I am glad that Bruce Timm & company decided to finally make a series about a DC super hero that is not Superman or Batman. This was a series I was excited for because it is the first DCAU series that is done in CGI. While the animation is a bit rough around the edges I am glad that the story was very rich in detail and character development. I also loved the fact that the story began with out an origin much like Batman and that the whole story revolved around the discovery of other Lantern Corps.I would have like to have seen other Green Lanterns rather than just having Hal & Kilowog in the first 13 episodes, but I am veryexcited for the second season and I feel it is going to be awesome with plenty more Lanterns to see.

I have loved Puss In Boots since he made his first appearance in `Shrek 2'. When I heard he was going to have his own movie I was more than excited.`Puss In Boots' is a great film for many reasons. It is a great origin story about this character and I was very impressed that they did not give you any hits or leeway towards any of the Shrek Films. The cast (minus Zach Galifanakis for me at least) was great. Selma Hayak and Antonio Banderas have always had great on screen chemistry, just watch `Desperado'. Lending their voices to this film they still have that great chemistry that just makes you enjoy their work from beginning to end. Also, while there are no hints to Shrek in this film there are just traditional pop culture references and one of a kind jokes that made the Shrek universe a fun place to be and `Puss In Boots' gives that you as well. There are some parts in this film that will make you laugh so hard and parts that will make you laugh even harder.`Puss In Boots' is a winner a great animated film destined to become a classic and if there is a sequel on the way, bring it!

When it comes to originality in the last 15 years film, Quentin Tarentino and Robert Rodriguez are two of the major names that come to mind. Each of these directors does their best to make their movies stand out with a little awkwardness and an appeal to the traditional film fan boy. `Grind house' is probably their most unique effort for many reasons. This was a film that was actually two 90 minute films for the price of one admission. This was not a film festival event nor was it a limited time offer for the movie going public. What you have to love about these two directors is they make movies for the sake of making movies and more importantly, they make them based on the influences that got them where they are today.Grindhouse is a tribute to 1970s-1980s low budgets `B' cinema. Normally shown in the theaters that no one would go to on a Saturday night, a back to back admission would show an under budget over acted slasher/action film in all of its cheesy glory. So, Tarentino & Rodriguez pay that tribute with a film from each of them.`Planet Terror' is your classic monster film. A disease has gripped a small town turning the populace into brain eating zombies and it's up to an outlaw and a one legged starlet to put an end to the madness. The cast is filled with a ton of well known names and of course a few surprises. Rodriguez captures the horrible acting and extreme fantasy gore in this picture as well as some extremely horrible jokes. You can definitely tell that these big named actors are having so much fun playing over the top horrible. Some of the lines are so terrible, but you laugh because that's the goal of the film. Also, you see Rodriguez's signature work in him always using the outlandish and completely insane, like a girl with a machine gun for a leg. The next film is `Death Proof', the story of a mysterious ex-stuntman played by the awesome Kurt Russell and how he has become the classic murdering drifter in an unstoppable muscle car. Tarentino gets probably his most charismatic cast since Jackie Brown and of course gives us his classic dialogue scenes. I liked this one the best because not only is it signature Tarentino, but he also throws in a bunch of references from his past films. If you are a fan of his you will no doubt catch the references.My take on `Grind house' is somewhere in the middle. While I love both of these directors, these two films really were not my cup of tea. They were fun to watch and I loved the homage to the `B' movies especially the camera work with the scratch patters on the film and bad editing cuts. However, I never really was a big fan of the typical cheesy grind house film, so that is probably why they don't appeal to me as much as a film like Sin City or Pulp Fiction. I do give a ton of respect to the casts of both films. Everyone from Rosario Dawson to Josh Brolin just took time out of their `serious' acting schedule to just make a crazy over the top fun fest. I also wish that Mary Elizabeth Weinstead got some more screen time. Though I have only seen her in `Scott Pilgrim' I just love her acting and the fact that she played such a girly girl really impressed me. Then again Tarentino always knows how to take any actor out of their usual element and turn them into something awesome. I recommend that you see these movies, but whether or not they are worthy of your collection is up to you.

...And by case I mean this 3 volume box set (yes pun intended). As a fan of many adult animated program nothing to me was more creative or origional as Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law. Like its partner in crime 'Sealab 2021 the creative minds of the cartoon network studio took an old washed up cartoon and turned it into some great. Birdman a third rate superhero has decided to fight crime in the manor of fancy suits and legal fees. Bringing some of Hanna Barera's most lovable characters to the stand for doing things we weren't meant to see.The lawsuits fly and the antics go out of control as Harvey voiced by the genuine Gary Cole (Brady Bunch Movie)throws his life on the line to defend everyone from Fred Flintstone, to Scooby Doo and many others. Going up against some of his fierce enemies nothing but monster belly laughs are had by all. This show features a great cast of famous comedians as Stephen Colbert (The Daily Show) Michael McKean (Best In Show) & Lewis Black just to name a few. A show that took 6 long years to come up with these 39 unforgetable episodes fans of this show can now hold on their fondest memories of a show that most of this world will probably forget about in the next 24 hours.Recommended Episode per Volume:Volume One: Showyu WeenieVolume Two: Back To The PresentVolume Three: Identity Theft.

The newest form of entertainment these days can be found on the internet. People are posting their own work in forms of fake movie trailers, independent animation and crazy antics that the world is eating up with a spoon. What stands out the most next to Dramatic Chipmunk and Laughing Baby is the Machinima series of 'Red VS. Blue: The Blood Gultch Chronicles'.I don't know how this idea came about, but out of no where a bunch of guys and girls decided to take the popular game of Halo and through a recently created style of animation called Machinima turned this video game into a 5 season, 100 episode comedic phenomenon. It is the story of two teams the Red Team composed of a leader starting to lose it a brown-noser a wise guy a mechanical officer that can only speak spanish and rookie whose name hysterically is Donut. Who are they up against you ask? The Blue team composed of an easily aggrevated hot head, a cluless associate a free lance female assasin a talking tank named Sheila and a total moron that is too dumb not to love. What is the objective of both sides....THEY DON'T KNOW!!!Each episode is comedic gold filled with sarcasm, stupid jokes and outbursts that make you want to constantly rewind and watch again. After being such a success on the internet all 5 seasons are now in this box set filled with amazing special features. It is the first of it's kind and will hopefully gain a lot in the world of animation. It obviously gained some ground already as a brand new series is already on the internet (Red VS. Blue: Reconstruction). So far it may be a little different, but so far so good.

I have to say I am not the biggest fan of horror and gore films, but Hostel just has that special something that makes you love it so so dearly. Hostel 2 is the exact same premise as the first, but this time it gives you alot more than what you expect. This time you are taken behind the scenes of the opperation its self. You get to see who is involved in the 'hunting' process and who is sick enough to pay top dollar to fulfill their most gruesome of fantasies. Once again Eli Roth pushes the bar with the torturing of 3 young women who get lured into this sick world. Again in a short amount of time he really develops the characters so you actually connect with them. This time you see both sides of the coin, through the eyes of a trouble torturer who is wondering if it's something he really wants to do. There are so many things that you will see that either make you cover your eyes or even stand up and cheer. Hostel pt. 2 is a well done continueation of the origional and it will surley leave an impression on you in a sick and twist way that only Roth and producer Quinten Tarentio can bring you.

After a brilliant season finale with Epilogue where could this masterful series have gone? Bruce Timm and company gave us a comic book geeks ultimate wet dream with Justice League's final season. This season brings the formation of one of DC's most memorable creations, The Legion of Doom. This time it is not 13 villians it is more like 50 of them. It is also the first time that some of these villians are scene in animation for the first time.This season is truly one for the fans. It is classic Superhero against Supervillian. Arch enemies pitted against one another. It is also the first season that Hawkman is finally brought into the Bruce Timm animation universe. As well as other faces such as Deadman, Captain Cold and Devil Ray (But we know him as Black Manta ;-)) The whole season shows the mystery unravel as the Justice is trying to figure out why suddenly all of these villains are coming out of the wood work causing trouble. The best part of this season is the conflict between the two villanous powerhouses Gorilla Grodd and Lex Luthor which leads to a fantastic and at some points hysterical brawl. Still nothing can prepare you for some of the revolations that take place towards the end of the series as well as the most amazing battle between Superman and Darksied that is so huge it takes two episodes to finish it. Although this is the final season of probably one of the greatest animated dramas of the new millenia it is great to know that the show ended one a good note with only the satisfaction of the fans in mind. To Bruce Timm and company thank you for all your wonderful work from 1991-2006

After the major success of 'Iron Man' and of course the special surprise that was revield to us at the end of the film, we were all eager for the next big Marvel hero movie. So In between the summer kickoff with 'Iron Man' and the heavily anticipated blockbuster 'The Dark Knight', Marvel decided to revive a hero who was brought to shame a few years earlier.'The Incredible Hulk' was a complete make-over from Ang Lee's monstorsity with a talaented cast (Well....not much to say about Liv Tyler) much better special effects and a deeper more emotional story. The film also paid tribute to the fan favorite television show as well as the comic book geeks who pretty much went to see the movie against their will. This movie left me satisfied again it was not the greatest movie I had ever seen but like 'Iron Man' the movie was fun and enjoyable. Of course with Marvel's big project that will be heading to theaters in the next few years the end of this film will also leave you with a smile on your face.

Well the boys of RvB are back for another adventure in Recreation. Like its predecessor it picks up right where the last chapter left off. After 20 episodes of serious back story the guys of RvB felt it was time to bring back the nuttiness and mayhem that they began with and let me tell you it is great. The first big positive is the return of two of the best characters. Yep you got it, Donut and Tucker make a triumphant return and they never skip a step in their hilarious hyjinxs. Still, there is a great story in these 19 episodes and the ending is definitely one that is going to leave you wanting more. Will there be another RvB series to follow this one? Who knows, but for now just enjoy RvB going back to the basics that made them a cult classic.

A normal American would be naive to think nothing good would rise out of Germany, but then again that person is probably listening to Brittney Spears and Ja Rule records. Blind Guardian is one of the most underrated artists the music world has to offer today. While most stereotype heavy metal music as dark and suicide inducing, Blind Guardian spits in the face of the mainstream, by delivering a hard sound with an artistic concept. What better concept would be appealing than J.R.R. Tolkien's work 'The Lord of the Rings'? Not only that, but the music has deep within it the influence of Renaissance and Middle Ages folk music. These loud, yet harmonious songs bring a world of Hobbits, magic and monsters to life without all the obscenity seen in today's mainstream hard rock and rap albums. Blind Guardian also presents great vocals and musicianship, which is something bands such as Metallica could never give, even when they were halfway decent. "Nightfall" is a record that music appreciators and Tolkien fanatics will welcome into their homes with delight. I am almost positive that J.R.R. would give his stamp of approval if he were around to hear this band.

The newest installment in the Bruce Timm DC animated film library is none other than the greatest Super Heroine in comic book history. Wonder Woman, the legendary Amazonian princess is given her first in depth origin story. This is a first for many comic book and DC animated universe fans alike and it is done in a fan appreciative manor.This story takes the fan favorite Wonder Woman stories and meshes them altogether in traditional Bruce Timm story telling, relatiable characters and an excellent voice cast. I would never have imagined that the well known Kerri Russel was able to portray such a strong heroine. Yet, this is an origin story so it is a much younger version of the character so it makes sense to bring a voice that can be transformed into a much stronger voice through time. The other cast memebers consist of Alfred Molina, Virginia Madesen and Rosario Dawson (to name a few). The outlay of the story is not constant brooding darkness, but it is a mature story so there are some real topics and often humerous moments that make it very real.Bruce Timm, is really taking full advantage of these films. His films are not always made with the pure satisfactory of the fans in mind. These are chances to show new innovative portrayals of the DC animated universe. Each film has a different mood, different style and never the same actors twice. I think that's what makes me want to see these films because they are different. The next film on the horizon is a new twist on Green Lantern. If you pick up the double disk there is an excellent documentry on the new project and because of this new innovative story they have in store for us, I cannot wait.
