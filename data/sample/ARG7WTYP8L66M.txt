I must admit that I read this book after having seen Atom Egoyan's stunning film version -- and I had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by it.Fortunately, Trevor's work also sticks in the mind. It is an elegant dance between a self-satisfied gourmand who has a taste for young women whose lives are disordered, luring them into his web ever so slowly and cutting off their lives. Felicia is different from the others in one important respect: She has caught they eye of the benign but determined Miss Calligary, a Jamaican street preacher who strives to &quot;gather in&quot; disturbed souls.Many critics have criticized the character of Felicia for being insufficiently realized. She is like Lena Grove from Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST: Without being a developed character in her own right, her pregnant wanderings and confusion set the evil or craven minds of the people around her in motion. Fortunately, it is Felicia who quite unawares sends Miss Calligary and her &quot;Gatherers&quot; after the startled Hilditch.A book well worth reading from an author whose work I would like to explore in greater detail.

While I greatly enjoyed reading ZORBA and loved its title character, I could not help but think that its author is in some way twisted in his thinking. The villagers' treatment of Madame Hortense and of the widow is shocking in both the book and the excellent movie by Cacoyannis. If Kazantzakis is himself a Cretan like the villagers, why does he present them as so vile?The author is also markedly anti-clerical. Zorba's dealings with the monastery above the village are nothing less than aiding and abetting in the crime of arson: He works on an addled monk to burn down the monastery, and provides him with paraffin to make the flames burn more intensely.While I am on this negative train of thought, I found the author's treatment of his women characters uncomfortably misogynistic. Curiously, Zorba is much more open-minded than Kazantzakis appears to be.On the other hand, Zorba is a vital character whose every word and act makes for excitement on the printed page. I could easily have read another 500 pages in the same vein, but such is not to be.The pictures I have seen of Kazantzakis show him to be a rather forbidding looking individual. I wonder how it is that the strange mixture of attraction and meanness could appear in the same face, and yet it does.

There were three great books written about journeys to the American West in 1859: The best was Mark Twain's semi-fictional ROUGHING IT. The next best was Sir Richard F. Burton's THE CITY OF THE SAINTS, about a journey to see what Mormonism was all about and to meet with Brigham Young.That Horace Greeley's book should be third in this line-up is no disgrace. There is so much self-conscious mythmaking about the Old West that eyewitness accounts of intelligent observers are as rare as hen's teeth. Before the completion of the Trans-Continental Railroad, any journey across the Great Plains was attended by danger, discomfort, and memorable encounters. It is unfortunate that there so so few good accounts.Greeley was first and foremost a newspaper man. He had a sharp eye for what he thought would interest his readers (unlike Twain &amp; Burton who wrote sub specie aeternitatis) and did not disappoint. His descriptions of the Indians, the rigors of the road, and the struggling communities a-borning west of the Platte make for fascinating reading.This is one of those great books to take along on a car journey through the Rockies and Great Plains.

When I started reading this book, all I knew about Saramago was that he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature; so I did not know what to expect. Although the publisher compares him to Borges, Rushdie, and Garcia Marquez, what we have in the man from Portugal is a true native original.We are introduced to the dusty world of a professional proofreader -- a fussy type who regrets having two gerunds in his name. I felt as if I were propelled into MOLLOY or some other of Beckett's novels as the beginning spiralled around this seemingly unlikely character.Suddenly, everything changes. At a critical juncture in a history of the siege of Lisbon he is proofreading, Silva suddenly introduces a caret and adds the word &quot;not&quot; -- thus completely changing the history.His new boss, a Dr Maria Sara is enchanted by this Bartleby-like act of negation. She challenges Silva to write a &quot;what if&quot; novel on the supposition that the history occurred as modified by the &quot;not&quot;: that the Crusaders, instead of helping the King of Portugal defeat the Moors, actually sailed on to the Holy Land directly.Meanwhile, Silva is clearly becoming enchanted with Maria Sara. What ensues is both the strangest and most convincing of love stories. Silva writes his book, brings us into the thick of the history as he imagines the various characters from the blind muezzin to the German knight to the king himself. All along, he and Maria are romancing each other through the events of the siege.What an incredible ride! Saramago is a master at easing from one world into another and taking us with him. He is both a master story-teller and an authentic modern in his handling of a character's state of mind -- a writer who easily could hold his own in the company of the great writers of our time.

I came to this strange and wonderful book without the slightest inkling of what it was about -- simply because it was in the recommended reading for many guidebooks about Italy. First and foremost, it is an autobiography of a great physician and animal lover who just happened to spend some years of his life on Capri.Autobiographies can make for strange reading, especially when there are obvious omissions. Although Axel Munthe frequently accuses himself of being a ladies' man, there is no mention of any love interest by name or even generic description. (That reminds me of film director Josef von Sternberg's FUN IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY, where we learn in passing that the author was married because of a cryptic mention in a subordinate clause 300 pages into the book.) Also missing is any mention of Munthe's childhood, although I understand there is at least one other autobiography written by him (MEMORIES AND VAGARIES), which I have not read.There is, however, one section that does not appear in any autobiography that I have ever seen: An anticipation of Munthe's Last Judgment in Heaven following his death, with St. Peter, Moses, Athanasius, and St. Francis joining in the discussion.STORY OF SAN MICHELE ranges from Paris to Lapland, Rome, Naples, Calabria, and Capri. We see duels, medical cases of wealthy women with imaginary diseases, demonic housekeepers, quacks, midwives, prostitutes, victims of cholera and earthquakes, brigands, shamans, and even an alcoholic ape. Munthe is a magnificent raconteur, and his book is a joy to read and reread.

Picture a world in which a shadowy entreprenour rubs shoulders with the great and powerful, while hard-driving yuppies stop at nothing to be associated with his schemes. Sounds like Ron Reagan's &quot;Morning in America,&quot; doesn't it? Except it is Victorian London. The entreprenour is Auguste Melmotte. The yuppies are the scions of great and small families hurling themselves at his daughter, his phantasmagorical railway (between Salt Lake City and Vera Cruz yet!) company, and the hem of his cloak. And the book is Anthony Trollope's THE WAY WE LIVE NOW.Like all of Trollope's books, this one is as well crafted as any by Eliot or Thackeray; yet the theme and handling are strikingly modern. I came to this book by way of the Barsetshire novels with their depiction of rural clergy. I should have read THE WAY WE LIVE NOW first.Especially worth noting are the surprisingly full characterizations of Marie Melmotte, daughter of the financier, who is courted by her emotional inferiors, and Roger Carbury, a rural landowner who holds aloof from the fray and helps several of the others pick up the pieces from their lives.The only negative is the book's anti-semitism, though it makes several attempts to lift itself from this charge.

If for no other reason than his production of GETTYSBURG, Ted Turner deserves to be remembered with thanks by generations of filmgoers to come -- long after everyone has forgotten the flap over colorization.When you think about it, the idea was a natural. Bring together some talented Hollywood actors, a very competent director, and join them with thousands of Civil War re-enactors -- those hardy hobbyists who live to commemorate the War Between the States. No other war film can boast thousands of authentically dressed extras for the many battle scenes. The result is an epic sweep which really gives one an idea what a tragedy the death of 55,000 brave Americans looked and felt like.Because Civil War re-enactors tend to be over 40 and a bit generous of girth, the soldiers may not have looked quite like the gaunt figures captured by the cameras of Matthew Brady. No matter: They more than made up for it in enthusiasm.For the sake of simplicity, we see three parts of the battle. First Union Cavalry General Buford (ably played by Sam Elliott) takes possession of the town of Gettysburg and its adjacent high ground and keeps the battle hot until the infantry arrives. On the second day is the brilliant defense of Little Round Top by Col Chamberlain (played by Jeff Daniels) and his 20th Maine Regiment at the far left of the 20-mile-long Union Line. The climax comes with Pickett's Charge on the third day against the center of the Union Line.We see the action primarily from the point of view of the South. While the commander of the Union forces, General Meade (Richard Anderson), appears in only one short scene, there are numerous meetings between General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) and Robert E Lee (a superb performance by Martin Sheen). We get to meet and know Pickett (Stephen Lang), Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan), and several other members of the Confederate General Staff. On the Northern side, there are all too few scenes with Winfield Scott Hancock, the general who takes the full brunt of Pickett's charge.Since I saw the premiere of this film on TNT in 1993, I have come back to it again and again; and I am particularly happy to have obtained the DVD recently. If you like the Civil War, if you like history, if you like war films, if you like GREAT films, you too will come back for more.

We were introduced to the narrator of Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME in Volume 1, SWANN'S WAY: We saw a few scenes from his childhood in Combray and the beginnings of his love for Gilberte, the daughter of his family friend Swann, whose disastrous love affair (and subsequent marriage) with a courtesan named Odette de Crecy takes up the majority of the volume.In WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE, the narrator makes his first tentative attempts at love. His plan to ingratiate himself with Gilberte by becoming friends with her parents backfires badly when Gilberte begins to distance himself from him. He agrees then to spend a season with his grandmother in a Norman oceanside resort named Balbec. There, in the most memorable scene in the novel, he makes the acquaintance of a &quot;little band&quot; of eight girls whose poise and sang-froid disarranges his senses. He falls in love, with first, then another. As the novel ends, we see him select one of them, Albertine, for future conquest.This is my second time through the budding grove of Proust's great multi-part novel with its crescendo of (unfulfilled) sensuality. Such was the impact of the Balbec scenes that I thought that the narrator's pursuit of the band of girls took up most of the novel. In fact, it does not appear until well into the last part and takes up less than 200 pages. It is simply that Proust imprinted that scene so strongly in my mind that, over the years, I mistook a part for the whole.WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE introduces some memorable characters that will come back in future volumes: In addition to Albertine, there are Robert de Saint-Loup, the painter Elstir, the Marquise de Villeparisis, and the Baron de Charlus. In the later volumes, we will see how Marcel (for that is the narrator's name) will fare with Albertine, and how the world that he saw as a shimmering fairy castle will shatter with the working out of his destiny, that of his friends, and that of the French in the years before the Great War.One of the great chess grandmasters commented on the opening setup position -- before any moves had been made -- by saying &quot;All the mistakes are there, waiting to be made.&quot;

These are not Conrad's most famous stories: Until I read the book, I had not heard of any of them. Nonetheless, this is one author whose worst work is better than most others' best. On a recent plane trip to Seattle, I found two of the four stories merely diverting, and the other two equal to his best.&quot;The Partner&quot; is a grim tale of human weakness spiralling down to a predictable horror; whereas his humorously baroque &quot;The Inn of the Two Witches&quot; reminds me in its tone of Washington Irving in LEGENDS OF THE ALHAMBRA, though set in a later time period.What happens when you fall so deeply in love so fast that you can't act to save your life? Conrad gives his answer in &quot;The Planter of Malata,&quot; in which a successful loner named Renouard confronts the yawning vastness of an empty life. Felicia Moorsom is a bit two-dimensional and a prim and proper Victorian to the nth degree. This tale is a psychological thriller that does not let you breathe until the last line.The final tale -- &quot;Because of the Dollars&quot; -- is my favorite. It reminds me of ALMAYER'S FOLLY and OUTPOST OF THE ISLANDS with its shallow-draft vessels penetrating into the heart of remote islands. Captain Davidson is a classic Conrad hero caught in a trap: How he manages to escape it at the cost of a wife who doesn't love him and, by the way, his ability to smile is one of the author's most perfectly taut stories.It is amusing to read Conrad's preface to the stories: He seems to be wincing excessively in response to early criticism after circulating the stories to his friends. Needless to say, his friends were over-critical: WITHIN THE TIDES struck me as a treasure that I had somehow overlooked all these years.

There are few great novels about people who are basically good and who are, in the end, rewarded for it. I can think of only three others I have read in this genre that had any literary merit: Eliot's ADAM BEDE; Elizabeth Gaskell's CRANFORD; and Oliver Goldsmith's THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. I can see why SILAS MARNER is usually regarded as a novel to be read by the young, if only because it reinforces values that most of us see as desirable.Granted that Marner starts out as a miser, if only because he is so isolated from the rural community in which he lives. When Marner's small fortune is stolen, a strange thing happens: His neighbors gather closer to him and help him, drawing him out of himself and illuminating the goodness that was always inside of him. Marner's neighbor, Dolly Winthrop -- a poor, inarticulate wheelwight's wife who does everything she can to make Silas a part of the village of Raveloe -- particularly shines through in an excellent supporting role, one of many in the book.When a toddler whose mother dies crawls into Marner's house, the process begins to accelerate as he adopts her. The weaver now has someone to live for; and the love between him and the little Eppie begins to flower.Good seems such undynamic a quality in literature. George Eliot is one of the few writers who can make the tribulations of a good person worthwhile reading. In weaver and his neighbors, Eliot has created an entire community that strives for the greatest good (with the sole exception of Dunsey Cass, who steals Marner's fortune). The best books always make you wonder what happens next; and SILAS MARNER kept me turning the pages, marvelling at my own reactions to what I would once have thought was too simple and flimsy to engage my attention.George Eliot is a writer of many surprises and many surprising strengths. I had approached this book only because I was filling in a gap in my reading. Having read it, I urge anyone to pick up this book if you are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding.

When Thomas Jefferson came to sum up his lifetime accomplishments, there was no mention of his two terms as President of the United States. Instead, he saw himself as &quot;Author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom, &amp; Father of the University of Virginia.&quot;E M Halliday pretty much avoids the great political moments of Jefferson's life and answers, instead, the question: What kind of man was this? Much of the book is involved with Jefferson's relations with his wife, daughters, and -- more speculatively -- with his maid Sally Hemings, who was not only a slave but his late wife's half sister. Ever since Fawn Brodie first broached the subject in her 1974 biography, the Sally Hemings question has intrigued many scholars, at least those who were not previously over-invested in the notion of an altogether more celibate founding father.I do not take sides one way or the other, but I find the possibility intriguing. Considering that Jefferson had in fact a documented ability to dissemble and act contrary to his stated beliefs, I am willing to accept that he was a less than perfect man. Today, some Kenneth Starr type abetted by a swirling band of journalistic and political harpies would have wiped the act in his face with every emission across the full media spectrum. But the times were different then, and there was an inherent disconnect among Southern slave-owners between &quot;could&quot; and &quot;should.&quot;I am fascinated by the fact that Jefferson did not regard his presidency as the pinnacle of his career. He always valued the domestic life; he loved being a planter, though he was a financial failure at it; and he loved dabbling in domestic architecture. I thank E M Halliday's book for introducing me to this Jefferson; and I think none the less of him for his putative peccadillos.

I was surprised to find when I picked up this book that it is not the same selection of stories as the earlier published THE ALEPH AND OTHER STORIES 1933-1969, translated by Norman Thomas di Giovanni in collaboration with Borges himself. Instead, it is a translation of two volumes published by Borges in Argentina, THE ALEPH and THE MAKER (EL HACEDOR), translated by Andrew Hurley.As for the stories themselves, I can say only that they are some of the most magical tales written in the last hundred years, perhaps even ever. Stories like "The Immortal," "Story of the Warrior and the Captive Maiden," "The Zahir," and "The Aleph" are worthy of being read over and over again.Since I already have these stories in other form by other translators, I wanted to determine how good Hurley's translation is. To that end, I'll compare some of my favorite passages. Let's start with the title story in the Hurley translation:"Under the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbelievable brightness. At first I thought it was spinning; then I realized that the movement was an illusion produced by the dizzying spectacles inside it. The Aleph was probably two or three centimeters in diameter, but universal space was contained inside it, with no diminution in size. Each thing (the glass surface of a mirror, let us say) was inifinite things, because I could clearly see it from every point in the cosmos."Here di Giovanni with the same paragraph:"On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbelievable brilliance. At first I thought it was revolving; then I realized that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things, since I saw it distinctly from every angle of the universe."I'd say that Hurley did a workmanlike job, but I like di Giovanni, especially with "the dizzying world it bounded," much more idiomatic than "the dizzying spectacles inside it." Now here's Hurley with "A Biography of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz":"As Cruz was fighting in the darkness (as his body was fighting in the darkness), he began to understand. He realized that one destiny is no better than the next and that every man must accept the destiny he bears inside himself."From di Giovanni's "The Life of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz":"Cruz, while he fought in the dark (while his body fought in the dark), began to understand. He understood that one destiny is no better than another, but that every man must obey what is within him."Again, I accept the Hurley, but prefer di Giovanni."Every man must obey" is simpler, more idiomatic than "every man must accept the destiny."One complaint I have against both translations is that neither bothers to provide translations of quotations from the Latin. This is particularly disturbing in the case of "Story of the Warrior and the Captive Maiden," in which two four-line excerpts are taken from a Latin tomb of a Lombard warrior that turn out to be quite interesting. I finally had to turn to Thomas Hodgkin's THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE to find the whole epitaph Englished.In summary, it is better to read Hurley than not to read Borges at all; but, given the chance, I would prefer di Giovanni by a slight margin.

Picture to yourself a strange coast bordered by seven islands and a zone of shifting sands and ship passages that have a sudden way of disappearing at low tide. When a British yachtsman named Davies (one who would feel at home with the grundge look) discovers that a former British naval officer is in very cozy with the Germans -- did I neglect to say that the coast is East Frisia, that part of Germany between the Dutch and Danish borders? -- the mystery becomes not to find out who the guilty party is, but what type of skullduggery is afoot.The narrator is Carruthers, a British civil servant whom Davies talks into joining him under somewhat false pretenses. After some qualms, Carruthers joins in wholeheartedly. From this point on, you are looking at the coastline charts as closely as the principals are (if you don't, you will lose track of the story, which follows geographic features more closely than any other novel in memory).While the action is spectacular, Childers is noticeably weak on character, especially with regard to the sole female character, the German spy's daughter. But you can't always have everything, and what RIDDLE OF THE SANDS (1896) has to offer makes for very good reading.

Julio Cortazar reminds me more of the late great Spanish film director, Luis Bunuel, one of the founding fathers of Surrealism, who once remarked that, when writing a film, he always aimed for whatever was most disturbing in any given situation. Similarly, Cortazar's stories are all constructed around a disturbing vision. In &quot;The End of the Game,&quot; for instance, three children don bizarre costumes and assume attitudes for the passengers on the trains that zip by them.&quot;Blow-Up&quot; is very different from Antonioni's film. There is a menace in the interplay between the photographer, his unwitting subjects, and a third party who was watching both.My favorite story in the collection is &quot;The Pursuer,&quot; a nakedly brilliant study of a black American Jazz musician and the critic who never quite understands the demons that give birth to the music. The story is dedicated to Ch. P., who I assume is Charley Parker. Cortazar's musician lives on the edge and is plagued by disturbing visions as he spirals down into a personal apocalypse. The critic, on the other hand, tries ineffectually to help the musician, but is more worried about what people will say about his latest study of the musician's work.Cortazar's stories take place in a kind of half-European, half-Latin Neverland. Born in Belgium of Argentinian parents, he spent most of his life in Europe. It is as if the author's self-exile gave birth to a demon of restlessness that possessed his characters.Although this is the first Cortazar I have read, it will not be the last.

Autobiographies are inherently unreliable. We all want to gloss over the embarrassing or wrongful moments in our lives and present ourselves as engaging "packages" to our contemporaries and to posterity. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau's CONFESSIONS, we have an autobiographer who is willing to show you his life -- warts and all.What strikes many contemporary readers as somewhat whack about Rousseau is that he gave several of his own children up for adoption, thinking they would be better cared for by a charitable institution than at home. Although he never "officially" tied the knot with Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Levasseur in a religious or civil marriage, he was at the very least what we would today call her common law husband.As with Montaigne in his essay "Of Experience," we are introduced to Rousseau's painful urinary problems. He had to catheterize himself frequently to be able to urinate at all; and toward the end of the book, he talks about adopting an Armenian garb because he could no longer comfortably wear trousers.Even more painful than the physical was that Rousseau appeared to be a trusting person who tried to make friends, but was frequently betrayed by them. Some of the betrayers include such famous contemporaries of the author's as Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d'Alembert. It is possible that Rousseau had a strong streak of paranoia, as it is unlikely that so many of his ex-friends would form conspiracies against him.Perhaps in no other book is there such stress laid on the perils of having to seek patronage rather than earning money on one's own merits. I know that, if I were living in 18th century France under the old r&eacute;gime, I, too, would have difficulties because of my own blunt personality. One had to have the manners of a dancing master and the insincerity of a groupie dealing with the notoriously unreliable French nobility of the day.Although Rousseau earned some money earlier in his career teaching and copying music, he earned little or nothing from his books. In fact, he was frequently cheated by his business partners, some of whom plagiarized and published his texts under their own names.In the end, we have a great writer telling of his few halcyon moments and the slow downward spiral of his life. Fortunately for us, Jean-Jacques managed to turn the story of his life into one of the greatest autobiographies ever written -- and perhaps the greatest work to come from France in the 18th century, a time crowded with great literary talent.Cohen's translation dates back many years, but is completely adequate to the purpose.

Some writers create such great characters that you don't care if the story line is a little murky. My favorite example of this is Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP: I have read the book and seen the movie multiple times, and still have difficulty sorting it all out. Some of Dickens' work falls into this category, as well as some recent mysteries, such as AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST.If the ultimate measures of a work of fiction are that you care about the people and you want to know what happens next, then SMILLA is a masterpiece. To this, I would have to add the novel's sense of place: Copenhagen and the sea off the West Coast of Greenland are sketched in few but deft strokes.Ultimately, it is Smilla herself who is the star attraction. Half Dane, half Inuit (Eskimo), she thinks like a little of both. The Danish half is something of a scientist, while the Inuit half has a sense of snow and ice that is alien to anyone south of the Arctic Circle. While afraid of water, Smilla thinks nothing of taking a stroll on the ice in the harbor of Copenhagen, instinctively sidestepping weaknesses which would plunge her toward an icy [demise].Not since LA FEMME NIKITA have I seen such a dangerous woman in a fight. Her quick disabling of her father's girlfriend Benja and an over-inquisitive crewman aboard the ship KRONOS are memorable. At the same time, her feelings for the Inuit boy Isaac are sincere and credible, such that I almost felt as if the author were female.On the other hand, the ending is not satisfying -- a little too Indiana Jones-y for my taste -- and that while Hoeg's characterization of the main characters is on the mark, he creates too many subsidiary characters, particularly in the Denmark scenes, and too many complications from which to extricate himself successfully.That being said, I look forward to see the direction that Hoeg takes with his future works. Sure it's not perfect, but it's such a fun read that it'll whet your appetite for more.

&quot;Down these mean streets a man must go,&quot; wrote Raymond Chandler on the subject of the detective novel. Few knew he was paying tribute to another writer, now almost forgotten, who wrote about the mean streets of London's Docks around 1900. In TALES OF MEAN STREETS, CHILD OF THE JAGO, and THE HOLE IN THE WALL, Arthur Morrison wrote about the world into which he was born. (Interestingly, he also wrote some great detective novels at the same time that Doyle was writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.)Some of the stories in TALES OF MEAN STREETS seem sentimental today: There is no lurid sex, the cursing is subject to the &quot;code&quot; of Queen Victoria's day, and much of the violence takes place off stage. If you accept the givens of that day, you will enjoy Morrison; and you will see how the American detective novel and the film noir owe far more to Morrison than to Conan Doyle or anyone else. Morrison deserved to be remembered and honored.

Imagine a society in which someone gets really cheesed off about his neighbor and decides to bushwhack him, and maybe his whole family and his servants while they're at it. Forget the police, forget the army. There isn't any. If you're unhappy about this, you try to get your favorite chieftain to intervene. Of course you'd better have a whole bunch of armed followers to show that you mean business. You can bet the murderer will too as a matter of course. How you come off in this hypothetical society depends on how much influence you wield on your neighbors. If you're willing to go to bat for them -- and vice versa -- your power will increase. Unless, of course, someone decides to swing an axe at your hatrack in the meantime.This is Medieval Iceland in the 13th century, when this and all the other great sagas were written. The EYRBYGGJA is one of the best of the sagas -- provided that you can handle all the genealogies. (Virtually all the people in the saga were real people; and many of today's Icelanders can trace their families back almost 1,000 years.)If there is any hero in the EYRBYGGJA, it is Snorri the Priest. He manages to maintain his power despite several threats that unfold during the several generations of this story. At times, as in the case of the feud with Arnkel, Snorri seems to be in the wrong. But he is consistently faithful to his friends and therefore has no problem raising the forces to back up his position. His life bridges the conversion to Christianity in the year 1000: Snorri proves his adaptability by going from a priest of Thor to an advocate of the new religion. In all the Icelandic sagas I've read, most of the characters do not seem to be wholeheartedly committed to either the old or the new religion; but all are superstitious about the restless dead, which brings me to one of the most fascinating aspects of this saga: the ghost episodes that seem to proliferate. I particularly like Thorolf Twist-Foot, a disagreeable old man who keeps coming back from the dead and causing trouble -- which Snorri deals with in most inimitable fashion by holding an ancient legal proceeding called a &quot;door court&quot; to expel them.My only criticism: This book needed a good set of maps for following the action. The lone map provided is inadequate.

Sir Richard F Burton is one of the most famous of unread authors. Nearly everyone can tell you about his scandalous doings with native women, his marriage to an ultra-Catholic Englishwoman, and the latter's destruction of the author's private papers after his death.Ever since I read Fawn Brodie's excellent biography, THE DEVIL DRIVES, I have collected some 20 different Burton books and read most of them. If you make allowances for Burton's diabolical thoroughness (involved footnotes, appendices, foreign language quotes, tables, etc.) and his Victorian circumlocutions in dealing with taboo subjects, he is a truly wonderful read.Although FIRST FOOTSTEPS is not his most famous book, it is probably the best one to start with. The action is not only more focussed, but Burton did feel he needed quite so much of a scholarly carapace to report back to the scholarly organizations back in Britain. And it finishes up with a stirring postscript about an attack on Burton's camp by Somalis in which the author barely escaped with his life.Perhaps this is a book that Presidents Bush and Clinton should have read before committing U.S. troops to the region: Burton shows us that not much has changed in the region in 150 years. He was in constant danger, and survived only because his knowledge and guts were more than an a match for his enemies.This is an exciting book and deserves to be better known.

It was not easy being a poet and scholar in Nero's day. Since the Emperor regarded himself as the poet par excellence, everyone else was ultimately disposable. Both Petronius and Seneca were ultimately requested to commit suicide and did so, lest the Praetorian Guard were called in to "assist" them.In the earlier days of Nero's rule, when there was some possibility that his would be one of the rare enlightened reigns, Petronius and Seneca joined Nero in a regular after-dinner literary society where the humor was frequently raunchy and the sex more often than not perverted.The SATYRICON was originally a fairly long episodic spoof of the ODYSSEY: its hero offends the God Priapus by ransacking his temple and is stricken with impotence. He and his friends and bedmates wander through Italy recounting their adventures. The only fairly intact sequence tells of a dinner by a nouveau-riche merchant named Trimalchio who holds an elegant banquet but whose base-born origins are always showing. All the rest of the episodes are fragmentary, though not without interest.Seneca takes the recently poisoned Emperor Claudius down a peg by spoofing his deification. Starting with Julius Caesar, the Romans turned many of their leaders into gods upon their demise. Claudius -- who was by no means the nice guy portrayed in the Robert Graves books -- gets short shrift in the underworld. A clue: The title is usually translated as "The Pumpkinification of Claudius." Seneca was treading carefully here, as Nero's mother was Claudius' wife and is generally considered to have been the one who poisoned him.These are not works that you can sit down and read as if they were novels. The introductions are not only helpful, but mandatory to understanding what follows. Both works, along with the works of Lucan, are essential to understanding this darkly fascinating period of Roman history.

The excerpt comes from a quote from the poet Arthur Hugh Clough that serves as one of THE QUIET AMERICAN's two epigraphs. Graham Greene thrusts us into one of his moral quagmires in which the crabwise scuttling of his narrator comes up against the straightforward thrusts of the dangerously naive.Thomas Fowler is a British journal in Saigon during the 1950s, when the French were fighting Vietnamese Communist insurgents before the United States inherited that mess after the battle of Dien Bien Phu. He comes upon Arden Pyle, the Quiet American of the title, a man almost too innocent to live. (At one point, Greene writes that "innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.") While purporting to be an economic consultant, he is actually an American agent attempting to apply simplistic principles to a tangled situation that is beyond his understanding.In the process, he snags Fowler's Vietnamese mistress while pretending to remain the journalist's friend. Although he seems to be invulnerable in his innocence for a while, the quagmire finally claims him as a victim. He is very like one of Conrad's "pilgrims" in THE HEART OF DARKNESS, cool and elegant in their pursuit of nefarious colonial pursuits to the very end.The "illegitimate process" may be a good description of Pyle's work, but Graham Greene's ever-present "malpractice of heart" is seen in Fowler, the French police inspector Vigot, the mistress Phuong's sister, Fowler's fellow journalist Bill Granger, and the suspicious Mr Heng.At one point, Fowler wonders, "Wouldn't we all do better not trying to understand, accepting the fact that no human being will ever understand another, not a wife a husband, a lover a mistress, nor a parent a child? Perhaps that's why men have invented God -- a being capable of understanding." And, I might add, of forgiving.This is one of Graham Greene's most outstanding works, on a par with THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and A BURN-OUT CASE. Curiously, it seems almost as current as if it were written yesterday instead of half a century ago.

When I first moved to Los Angeles, the majority population was White with fairly large Hispanic and Black minorities. Now the majority population is Hispanic, and I frequently find myself communicating with them in Spanish.Look in any newspaper. All around the world, large masses of people are on the move: Albanians to Italy, Serbs to Hungary, Rwandans to Zaire, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to Britain, Algerians to France, and so on. Every year, the number of people in refugee camps grows; and the resources of nations are stretched to the limit to accommodate the influx.In America, we've had our own migrations: from the original 13 Colonies to the West, Blacks from the South to Northern industrial cities after World War II, and the Okies to California during the Depression.My point is that Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH discusses a very contemporary phenomenon with compassion and great artistry. His Joad family can just as easily be Mexican "Wetbacks" looking or a better life in the same places where the Joads went (Arvin, the site of the FSA's Weedpatch Camp, is mostly Chicano today). How Steinbeck, a native Californian, came to side with the Okies against the corporate farmers and their hired deputies, and the townsfolk who supported them, is an interesting story in itself. Suffice it to say that no one was more sympathetic with the plight of the poor than Steinbeck, who at times comes across as an American Gorky.There are other books that show equally great compassion. Steinbeck in this novel, however, rises to heights of poetry he was never to reach again. Tom Joad in this passage explains why he decided to become a labor organizer:"Says one time he [Jim Casy, the preacher] went out into the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul. Says a wilderness ain't no good , 'cause his little piece of a soul wasn't no good 'less it was with the rest, an' was whole. Funny how I remember. Didn' think I was even listenin'. But I know now a fella ain't no good alone."There are scenes, such as the description of the progress of a turtle seen by Tom as he walks down the long road home after being paroled, where you see as if in a magnifying glass the progress of untold thousands of farmers fleeing the drought of the Dust Bowl.This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man. It takes the side of the hated, misunderstood outsider and sees poetry, goodness, a rough justice, and a tenacity that can move mountains.

Some people say that Wiesel's NIGHT is fiction; others, that it is a factual memoir. Whichever side is right, what matters to me as a reader is that NIGHT is a profoundly moral work about surviving inhuman conditions, and that it is both powerful and superbly written.I am reminded of two other great concentration camp works -- Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH and Victor Frankl's MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING -- which it resembles. Where Wiesel differs is in his ability to depict Eliezer's central dilemma: whether to survive at all costs, or risk his own survival by giving aid to his father, who is less able to stand up to the torments of everyday life in the camps. There is a beautiful image of the prisoners' forced move from Buna to Gleiwicz when another son leaves his father in the lurch while Eliezer does his utmost to help his. When his father dies of dysentery shortly before liberation, the book comes to an end quickly because outside the memory of that moral struggle, there was nothing but undiscriminated pain.Throughout this short book, the small acts of kindness come unexpectedly and stand out like so many diamonds in a vast mountain of pitch.Life is full of moral choices, and we don't always make the right decisions. Wiesel brings home the point that trying to make the right choice is always important. Perhaps that is what ultimately separates us from the SS and camp kapos.

The English and American schools of crime detective fiction ultimately come from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Purloined Letter" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue," in which the solution of a crime is effected by the application of deductive reasoning from start to finish. These "tales of ratiocination," with Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes being the apotheosis of the reasoning investigator, are still the norm today in the English-speaking world.Such is not the case in France, where Georges Simenon has created an entirely different kind of detective, Superintendent Jules Maigret. In MAIGRET AND THE YELLOW DOG aka THE PATIENCE OF MAIGRET (1936), a man named Mostaguen has been cut down by a bullet in the Breton seaside town of Concarneau. At the scene of the crime is found a strange ungainly yellow dog. The victim belonged to a informal (and somewhat unpopular) group of businessmen who got together for cards and drinks every night in the bar of the Admiral Hotel.Superintendent Maigret is called in to investigate, along with Inspector Leroy. No sooner do they arrive, than attacks on the little group begin to ramp up: an attempted poisoning with strychnine, a missing local newspaper writer taken from his car leaving bloodstains behind, and the murder of a notorious philanderer. All these occur more or less under Maigret's nose. As the mayor begins to lose his patience with the big city investigator, the Paris press moves in en masse and camps out in the bar of the Admiral Hotel, kibitzing his every move.From the start, Maigret and Leroy take divergent paths. While the latter attempts to apply close deductive reasoning, his boss hangs out in the bar and has his attention riveted to the barmaid, Emma, and the yellow dog, who is somehow drawn to her. He instinctively feels that these two are somehow at the heart of the investigation and slowly begins to add to his knowledge of these two until the fog lifts.For most of the novel, Concarneau is besieged by foul weather; and the town is full of confused, frightened people who inevitably jump to the wrong conclusions and put pressure on Maigret and Leroy to follow up on their suggestions. Maigret not only keeps accumulating evidence but rudely ignores the press, the mayor, and the residents while marching to his own drummer. In the end, Maigret's instinct trumps Leroy's patient data-gathering and the wild surmises of the others, and everything falls together as the bad weather finally breaks, leaving Concarneau and us readers bathed in sunlight.The brooding quality of the scene, the confusion of the other characters, and the mysterious, almost solipsistic concentration of Maigret are the ingredients that make this a most delectable detective novel. This is the tenth Maigret I've read, and he seems to get better with every book I read.

This is my first Aimee Leduc novel, and I am happy to say that it came as a pleasant surprise. On my previous visit to Paris (in 1999), I was startled to see tough paratroopers armed with automatic rifles at the Chatelet-Les Halles metro station patrolling the platforms and corridors. Paris is no longer the city of Maurice Chevalier, or even Georges Simenon: What we have here is a rougher and edgier city with a compact tourist core surrounded by miles of slumlike banlieus along the edges.Cara Black's flics barely have the time to deal with murder, when other events like terror-driven explosions and a horrible TGV accident in the station. Rumanian thugs in cheap exercise suits abound, selling their muscle to developers and with an eye on the main chance, whatever it may be. The Bastille area, site of a notorious castle/prison torn down in 1789, is now dominated by the huge Opera Bastille. The local neighborhood, however, is being forcibly torn down and redeveloped.In walks private investigator Aimee Leduc. In the first few pages of MURDER IN THE BASTILLE, she is brutally attacked in an alley and blinded as a result of a damaged artery. For most of the novel, she can see nothing around her. The onus for the investigation falls on her dwarfish partner Rene, with occasional help en passant from overburdened police officers who knew her father on the force.I look forward to reading the other novels in the series.

It has been over 30 years since the first time I read this book. Coming back to it after all this time, my overwhelming impression was how much Conrad had compressed into so few pages. TYPHOON can easily be read in a single sitting; but don't plan on going to bed right after. Not without a good stiff drink.The Nan-Shan, a steamer of Siamese registry but with English officers, and with a cargo of Chinese coolie laborers returning from a stint overseas, encounters a deadly typhoon and somehow survives it. We see the story unfold through the eyes of Jukes, the first mate, who is awed by his stoic Captain MacWhirr's quiet resolve in the face of a storm of the century.Reading it, I felt transported to the Northridge Earthquake of 1994. A sound as of all the demons of hell -- shaking and rolling in six directions at once -- flashes of light from exploding transformers -- barefooted stumbling for my boots in a world of broken glass and crockery -- found by the police hours later walking down the street, stunned, with blood pouring from my ankle and a gallon jug of water in my hand.Or, replace it with an equivalent experience of your own. Conrad had looked death in the face and learned how to face it. His Captain MacWhirr stands fast in the fury and doesn't let his imagination of untold horrors interfere with guiding the ship through the storm. At one point, he tells Jukes in the wheelhouse, &quot;We must trust her [the ship] to go through it and come out the other side, That's plain and straight.&quot;Conrad is a wise teacher and a great writer. TYPHOON did more than survive a second reading: It awed me a second time. If I may quote once more from the book: &quot;MacWhirr had sailed over the surface of the oceans as some men go skimming over the years of existence to sink gently into a placid grave, ignorant of life to the last, without ever having been made to see all that it may contain of perfidy, of violence, and of terror.&quot;MacWhirr's initiation into this perfidy, violence, and terror shows us how we might likewise survive the storms and shipwrecks of our own lives. What an incredible book!

I have always loved Georges Simenon's Inspector Maigret novels and stories. And as I was going to visit Holland, I decided to read MAIGRET IN HOLLAND for &quot;atmosphere.&quot;Simenon doesn't disappoint. A murder takes place in a small Dutch seaport. Maigret is called in, and instantly everyone's hackles are aroused by this outsider Frenchman asking questions about why a popular resident was found dead. As usual, the more Maigret casts his eyes around, the more suspects and suspicious characters come to light. The darker side of human nature emerges from the outwardly benign residents, who are embroiled in a whole complex of deadly sins involving the victim.Was it the luscious and lubricious milkmaid? The shady character hanging around the docks? The victim's sister? widow? And what part did that hat play?Well, so sorry, I'm not going to spoil this one for you. You'll have to read it yourself, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Recently, a personal tragedy resulted in a rare hiatus in my reading. In attempting to return to normal, I found the only author that suited (and soothed) me was Anthony Trollope. As an English major at Dartmouth, I never encountered his works, and none were on the required reading list; yet now, there are few writers who can "embed" me in their world so easily as Trollope.This is the second of the Palliser series of six novels, the first of which was CAN YOU FORGIVE HER? Although it is not a prerequisite to understanding PHINEAS FINN, I recommend that readers start at the beginning, so that they have some idea of British parliamentary politics in the mid 19th century and the characters of Plantagenet Palliser, his wife Lady Glencora and their circle.To begin with, there was at that time no monetary recompense for being a member of the House of Commons. The assumption was that: (1) the member was independently wealthy or (2) the member had a day job which paid his bills. This becomes an overriding issue in the novel.Enter Phineas Finn, an engaging Irishman, who gives up the practice of law to run for an Irish seat in the House -- much to the consternation of his friends and relatives who worry how he is to make ends meet. He joins in with a group of Liberal politicians centered around Lord Beresford and his beautiful daughter, Lady Laura Standish. No sooner does Phineas get up the courage to propose to her than he finds he has been beaten to the punch by a wealthy Scottish member, who happens to be a dour and rigid Presbyterian.Next he targets Violet Effingham, who has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lord Chiltern, the brother of Lady Laura. In targeting Violet, Phineas runs up against the choleric Chiltern, whose "red hair is no lie," to quote one of my favorite lines in THE QUIET MAN. The two actually fight a duel across the Channel on a Belgian beach with no serious injory to either party. But Violet makes up her mind for Lord Chiltern, and Phineas is out in the cold again.As Phineas eventually makes it into the Treasury, which does carry some salary, he meets a beautiful wealthy Jewess named Mme Max Goesler, who has some feelings for him. Unfortunately, he had fallen under the tutelage of Mr. Monk, another Liberal politican who runs up against the prevailing political winds in the house. Not only does Phineas become a victim for his principles, but the Liberals are voted out; and Phineas is out of a job and flat broke.He returns to Ireland, marries an old childhood sweetheart, and gets a sinecure position in Cork as the Tories busily redraw the political map under Disraeli (called Daubeny in the novel).In addition to being a charmer -- though a bit feckless at times -- Phineas finds himself liked wherever he goes. Mind you, not enough to nab a beautiful, wealthy wife -- but there is a sequel to come called PHINEAS REDUX, which I am reading now, in which Phineas makes a comeback in his old haunts.As in all of my favorite Trollope novels, there are the obligatory fox hunting scenes, including one in which Phineas helps save Lord Chiltern, whose horse rolls over on him. He even saves the life of Mr Kennedy, Lady Laura's husband, by driving away some muggers. There is something sunny about the title character, and this quality shines throughout the novel.Anthony Trollope wrote some 47 novels: This one is one of the best, and will certainly make for an enjoyable read.

What I learned about the Louisiana Purchase in school was pretty cut-and-dried: A bunch of very statesmanlike men wearing powdered wigs made an incredible real estate deal that more than doubled the size of the United States and enabled Manifest Destiny to happen, usually within the next five pages.Jon Kukla did us all a service by sitting down and asking what the Louisiana Purchase actually meant to the North, the South, and the burgeoning Western Territories, both then, in the more distant future, and even now.In 1803, New Orleans was a Caribbean port with a large population of free mulattoes, Creoles, French, and Spanish -- not to mention a sprinkling of American traders. It was like nothing that the original Thirteen Colonies ever saw, and it was but a foretaste of the rampant multiculturalism that has become a dominant feature of our lives.Did you know that the first impulse to secession was not in the South, but in Massachusetts? The "Essex Junto," dating as far back as 1786, allowed itself to be influenced by Spain for purely regional benefits. As late as the Hartford Convention in 1815, the threat of secession was primarily a Yankee threat; only later did the South adopt it.Jefferson, Livingston, and Monroe tread on new ground in cutting the deal: There was nothing in the new Constitution to allow them such powers, nor was there anything that expressly forbade it. And no sooner was the deal made than the United States began to face new problems, such as the expansion of slavery in the new territories. It was the Purchase that led in an almost direct line to the Missouri Compromise of 1820; and from there, to the Dred Scott Decision; and from there to the horrors of the War Between the States.Kukla's book can be read on several levels. I read it as an exciting tale of diplomacy between the United States, Spain, and France spanning twenty years. As a work of scholarship, it contains extensive but unobtrusive endnotes, maps, and appendices containing the texts of the 1795 treaty with Spain, the Louisiana Purchase Treaty and Conventions, and some draft amendments to the Constitution proposed by Jefferson in 1803 to legitimize the Purchase.I did not expect much from this book at first, but Kukla was so successful in working in threads and themes that continue to this day, that the book is highly relevant and thought provoking. It is odd to call a book about diplomacy gripping, but any tale that weaves together Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, Toussaint L'Ouverture (the Black Haitian revolutionary), Talleyrand, and Napoleon Bonaparte so well can be described in no other way.

You've probably heard by now what this book is about: It is a story of how two young Chinese city dwellers discover a hoard of great European novels (in Chinese translation, of course) in a remote mountain hamlet during the troublous Cultural Revolution. This was at a time that the ONLY acceptable reading material was Mao's Little Red Book and other suchlike politico-economic tracts.To understand why I love this book, you have to understand that I went to France primarily to see Honore de Balzac's house on the rue Raynouard and his tomb at the Pere Lachaise cemetery -- both in Paris. When I first read OLD GORIOT years ago, I felt as if my eyes were opened for this first time. LOST ILLUSIONS, COUSIN BETTE, URSULE MIROUET and the others merely reinforced this love.Likewise, it was the Waverley Novels of Sir Walter Scott that impelled me to first go to Scotland, and to keep returning. And it was the NJALS SAGA and GRETTIR'S SAGA that took me to Iceland in 2001.The point I am trying to make is that the great stories are capable of enriching your life and casting away your blinders more effectively than anything else I can imagine. Balzac, Bronte, Cervantes, Hugo, Stendhal, Dickens, Tolstoy -- these are names to conjure with. I can think of no better way to bring enchantment and meaning to life than a course of the classics, undertaken with the same sense of awe and wonderment as the narrator, his friend Luo, and the little Chinese seamstress felt in their mountain fastness. Try it sometime.The only comparison I can think of is Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451, and -- even more -- Francois Truffaut's film of the same name, with its long tracks and pans across the covers of scores of Truffaut's favorite books as if it were us looking for the last time upon something that was loved, but about to be destroyed forever. Sadly, it's not unimaginable that a day will dawn on which, only in remote areas far from the nightmarish cities, will people of the future will look with wild surmise on the few literary treasures they can find in the dustbin of our civilization.Read Dai Sijie, and then read Balzac. You have to start somewhere. Why not right on top of the mountain named, appropriately, the Phoenix of the Sky?

The rumor is that Ellroy turned in a 900-page first draft. When his publisher protested, the author cut down the book to itspresent length by eliminating verbs, articles, adjectives, and most other parts of speech. The result is a breathless gallop through a darkly fascinating world of murder, incest, perversion, corruption, greed, and lust. And that's just for starters!Reading WHITE JAZZ is like reading Anthony Burgess's CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The language is a m&eacute;lange of English, LAPD crimestoppers' jargon, and 1950s pulptalk. Be prepared to deal with 187s, B&E;, bootjacking, hinkiness, FIs, 459s, IAD, rebop, snarfing with soshes -- among other things.What makes it all worthwhile is that Ellroy has a great story to tell, and he tells it well even if he invents his own language that only tangentially resembles English. Be prepared for harsh lights thrown into the darkest parts of the human soul. Beprepared for almost universal corruption, varying only in degree. As you spiral into the depths with Ellroy, you can almost feel the walls converging and the floor dropping from under you.This is a worthy conclusion to the author's Los Angeles Quartet. Be sure to read the novels in sequence for a sweeping panorama of 15 years of postwar degradation: THE BLACK DAHLIA, THE BIG NOWHERE, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, and -- not least of them -- WHITE JAZZ.

When I first came to Los Angeles, there were five Japanese language theaters in town. With my friends, I visited all of them on a regular basis. I fell in love with the first rank directors such as Kurosawa, Ozu, and Mizoguchi; but trailing not far behind them were other greats such as Kihachi Okamato (SWORD OF DOOM), Masaki Kobayashi (HARAKIRI), Kazuo Ikehiro (the Kyoshiro Nemuri samurai films from Daiei), Hiroshi Inagaki (the SAMURAI trilogy), and others.Okamoto was one of the best directors of action samurai films; and SWORD OF DOOM is one of his best films. Tatsuya Nakadai stars as an evil samurai who is seemingly invincible, the sole master of a sword fighting style that runs counter-intuitive to all the existing styles of his day. Toshiro Mifune has a small role as the master of a sword-fighting school who tries to counter Nakadai's baneful influence during the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.The unique contribution to this film is the notion that evil destroys itself from within. In the last scene, Nakadai and some of his henchmen are at a geisha house. Overcome with drink, Nakadai sees the ghosts of his victims and runs amok trying to attack them. I won't say what happens, because I would hate to ruin the ending for you.If you like the classical samurai films of the 1960s, this one is a must for you. The wide-screen letterbox print is nothing short of superb. A must see!

To be a samurai meant owing nearly absolute allegiance to the leader of one's clan, the daimyo. One often filmed story is about 47 loyal samurai committing harakiri en masse when their clan is disbanded. But what happens when the daimyo is unjust and plays with the lives of his loyal samurai?In SAMURAI REBELLION, a young samurai is forced by his daimyo to marry a difficult mistress who had dared to manhandle him. Lady Ichi surprisingly turns out to be a jewel, and Yogoro, her new husband, grows to love her. When the daimyo changes his mind and has her kidnapped after several unsuccessful attempts to bully the family, Yogoro and his father Itaburo (Toshiro Mifune) singlehandedly take on the whole clan.Before you know it, the blades are out of their sheathes, and bodies are falling all over the place. Particularly spectacular is a duel between Itaburo and his friend Tatewaki (played by the great Tatsuya Nakadai) in a windswept field of grass. Director Masaki Kobayashi (KWAIDAN, HARAKIRI) is at his best here; and numerous scenes are icily controlled and eerily beautiful as he guides his camera, breaking down sequences into abstract geometrical patterns.I can't help remembering the song in the musical BANDWAGON which summarizes HAMLET as &quot;The king and the prince meet / And everyone ends up mincemeat.&quot; As in HARAKIRI, there is a point to the mayhem here: The honor of a single family CAN outweigh the honor of the clan.

In the reptilian world of James M Cain, there is only a blink separating the urge from the act.A drifter gets a job at an isolated diner/gas station and sinks quickly into a lustful relationship with the Greek proprietor's young wife. And from consummated lust to consummated murder is an equally short jump. It is the ironic unfolding of the consequences in which Cain unhooks the direct causality from crime and its punishment that the actors in the drama become pawns in a larger game in which their actions are irrelevant.Made into 3 excellent films (including Michelangelo Antonioni's IL GRIDO), POSTMAN has never lost its ability to shock.

In this delightful early (1956) effort, Philip K. Dick reaches all the way back to Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal" and all the way forward to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.To jape is to cut up, to spoof outrageously a la Monty Python. Dick's hero, Allen Purcell, is about to assume the most powerful media position on the planet; at the same time, he is in fear of being imminently arrested for a jape involving the mutilation of a monument to Morec's beloved founder, the infamous Major Streiter.Morec is short for Moral Reclamation, a kind of Moral Majority Heaven on Earth in which any offenses -- most particularly of the sexual variety -- trigger vicious Maoist self-criticism meetings culminating in the loss of one's apartment lease. And without a lease, there's nowhere to go but the outer planets.Philip K. Dick weaves in a number of themes masterfully, from the devastation following a nuclear holocaust to the "Health Resort," a scheme for processing those who crack under the strain of Morec. There are juveniles everywhere (not what you think), not to mention the Cohorts, Active Assimilation, the Domino Method, "nooses," and the usual panoply of brilliant Dick inventions, such as all food dishes being enclosed in quotes, as in "His 'eggs' were cooling on the plate."There are arresting throwaway lines such as when the character of Sue Frost is introduced: "Her eyes, he noticed, were an almost colorless straw. A strong kind of substance, and highly polished."Although he has been compared to Borges and Kafka, Dick is very much an American original. THE MAN WHO JAPED's unusual combination of paranoia and a wicked sense of humor is unique, as if Orwell's Winston Smith in 1984 were played by John Cleese.

Most of the essays in this book were written between 1988 and 1992 -- a period that came at the end of a small renaissance in the art of travel writing, until the bores writing about Tuscany and the South of France suffocated it. Tim Cahill, Bruce Chatwin, Ian Buruma, and Paul Theroux were at their height -- as well as Iyer himself with his VIDEO NIGHT IN KATHMANDU. I revelled in their writings, glorying in dangerous places I would never actually visit for fear of tropical diseases, violent bands of guerrillas or outlaws, dictatorial governments, and -- primarily -- lack of funds.Pico Iyer is a writer who skates on the surface of things touristic. He has few sustained discussions with locals who can provide some light on the strangeness reflected back at him by these surfaces. And he does not appear to have done his homework: To visit Iceland, for example, without reference to the sagas of the 13th Century is almost to miss the point. The hardiness of a people raised on the example of Gisli Sursson (Gisla Saga) or Grettir Asmundarson (Grettir's Saga) is to really grasp the Juchi Idea (of self-reliance) he discusses in conjunction with his essay or North Korea.Although he can be a tad lazy, Iyer has the gift of gab. I still remember a one-page essay he wrote ages ago for, I believe, NEWSWEEK, on the decline of the comma in writing. If he were alive today, Oscar Wilde would approve of Iyer's work. Perhaps Iyer's wit in describing these surfaces is a sign of greatness that I just fall short of fully appreciating.I remember a travel book by Graham Greene (THE LAWLESS ROADS) in which the author breaks his only set of glasses during one particularly vile stretch of terrain and suddenly launches into a vicious attack on Mexico, cursing it for the pain it put him through to research his novel THE POWER AND THE GLORY. I never get the feeling that Iyer expresses anything deeper and amusement or mild inconvenience; and I really wonder what he feels about these places he visits. We may never know, because he wears his mask well.

ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is about the beauty of horses, the pain of making irrevocable decisions -- especially where love is concerned, the implacability of honor, and the darkness that is at the heart of the Mexican temperament. It is an unusual combination, but one that works surprisingly well.John Grady Cole and Lacey Rawlins are young cowpunchers who escape the postwar breakup of the range to head for one of the giant Mexican latifundos where one can ride a week before reaching the next estancia. Their work with horses and cattle is pure lyricism, such as the episode where the two promise to break sixteen wild mares in four days to get in good with ranch owner Don Hector and also for the sheer love of it.Their idyll is broken twice, once by the irresponsible young Jimmy Blevins who insists on tagging along with them and causing a broad swath of disaster in his wake, and the other time by John Grady's falling in love in Alejandra, the ranch owner's daughter. There is a sinister linkage effected when the outraged rancher has the Federales pick up Cole and Rawlins as suspected accessories to Blevins's crimes.For me, the culminating moment of the novel comes when McCarthy writes: &quot;He thought that in the beauty of the world were hid a secret. He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower.&quot;Cole and Rawlins's crossing of the Rio Grande was to be their initiation into a terrible knowledge whose consequences they barely escape with their lives. Blevins, on the other hand, is killed; and Alejandra, dishonored in the eyes of her family.A very powerful and very great novel!

Raymond Chandler made the definitive statement about L.A.'s Santa Ana Winds at the beginning of his short story "Red Wind." In Easy Rawlins' L.A., the hot, dry winds that fill the lungs with cactus dust and make the skin peel around the fingernails never seem to stop.Easy is in search of an erotic dream woman from his childhood who is being sought by one of those rich white families who have more skeletons than clothes in their closets. Around the same time, the very dangerous Raymond "Mouse" Alexander is released from the pen; and Easy's attempt to make a killing in the real estate market run up against a brick wall.There are plot threads aplenty, and enough characters to fill a passenger liner. Mosley is too good a writer to leave any threads untied, but I do get lost at times with some of the characters. One bad dude is not heard from for a hundred pages when he commits a particularly heinous murder at the very end. "Oh, yeah, wasn't he the guy that ...?" Sometimes, I would have welcomed the list of characters, complete with nicknames, that occasionally accompanies an 800-page Russian novel.What makes this a minor complaint is that Mosley has such a great sense of place and so much feeling for his characters. We don't meet the character he calls "Black Betty" until the end of the novel, but we keep seeing vignettes from Easy's past that keep building up the suspense, and any expectations are more than fulfilled by an ending that is bloodier than the last act of Hamlet.

Furst's writing is very film aware: As I read THE WORLD AT NIGHT, I felt that I was somewhere in between a prequel to CASABLANCA and one of Marcel Carn&eacute;'s 1930s celluloid evocations of despair, such as QUAI DES BRUMES. I was also conscious that Furst did a creditable job bringing to life a time and place we all knew mostly from the movies. Of course, a film adaptation of this novel would probably garner an R-rating, what with its hero's richly textured sex life.Jean Casson plays a small-time movie producer who has to learn how to shift for himself under the Nazi occupation of France. On the way, he not only falls in love with the hot starlet Citrine, but simultaneously acts as an agent for the Boche and the Resistance.Furst's Gestapo officers come across as unexpectedly tolerant and even bemused -- except when they are crossed. Ach, these French! Why can't they understand that we are only trying to help them? Lieutenant Colonel Guske of the SS in particular is sketched in with admirable restraint.My only problem with an otherwise wildly entertaining read is that Casson's escape from Gestapo headquarters at the end is just a bit too pat. With his strength at setting the mood and his aptitude for interesting and very French characterizations, Furst could have sacrificed some of the derring-do at the end without sacrificing the sense of the story.I first heard of the author on a National Public Radio broadcast while driving to the library. Within hours, I was congratulating myself for having found another interesting new writer.

So much of what has happened in Persia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in the last 150 years is due to what has been called "The Great Game." Russia has always been a superpower that lacked a salt-water seaport free of ice all year round. (The Black Sea doesn't count because Turkey controls access to it through the easily defensible Bosphorus and Dardanelles.) Consequently, it has always sought to destabilize South Asia in the hopes of being able to get a port on the Indian Ocean.One of the highest ranking pieces in the Great Game was the British intelligent agent Lieut-Col Frederick M. Bailey, who wrote this fascinating book. So if you're a great intelligence agent, why is it so difficult to write a good book? Simple: A good intelligence agent keeps too much unsaid. Information is his stock in trade, so he is very sparing of all the interesting details.Picture present-day Uzbekistan in the first year of the Bolshevik takeover (1918). No one in Europe had any idea of what to expect from the Bolsheviks. Would they become more moderate in time? Would the Muslim population accept them? Would the White Russians defeat them in battle and restore the Czar?In the midst of all these swirling theories strode the skinny and extremely canny Colonel Bailey. He set himself up in Tashkent as the official representative of His Majesty's Government but immediately ran into roadblocks. Without informing Bailey, Britain had in the meantime engaged the Bolsheviks in battle near Murmansk and near the Caucasus. That quickly made Bailey persona non grata (which meant ripe for execution in those times).But how does one arrest a wizard? Bailey immediately went underground and assumed the identity of a Romanian, Czech, Austrian, Albanian, or other POW, of which Tashkent had many from those WW 1 days. He rarely stayed in one place for more than a day or two, though he did manage to develop some loyal contacts, including the US consul Tredwell. For over a year, Bailey eluded capture. During the whole of that time, there was no effective contact with his government; and during most of that time, he was actively sought by the Cheka, or secret police.The escape from Tashkent was ingenious and dramatic. Bailey got himself hired as a Bolshevik agent under an assumed identity and assigned to Bokhara, which was not yet under Bolshevik control at that time. There, he reached into his inexhaustible supply of money and bought horses, men and influence to allow him to escape south to Meshed in Persia, where there was a British presence.I wish I knew at every point how the magician pulled a particular rabbit out of his hat, but I'll just have to take that as a given. Today, Bailey is regarded by the British as one of their greatest spies. In Central Asia, he is regarded as an arch-villain who threatened the development of Communism in Central Asia.MISSION TO TASHKENT is not an easy read, but it is absolutely vital in understanding the forces, many of which still operate in this pivotal area of the globe.

For over half a century, readers have turned to Amy Kelly's book for an exciting look at a broad swath of European history. From 1137 through her death in 1204, Eleanor was a principal player on the stage of history. She was married to two kings -- the mediocre Louis VII and the hot-tempered Henry II -- and mother to two other kings -- Richard the Lion-Hearted and King John the chicken-hearted. She had travelled to Constantinople, Jerusalem, Germany, and all around England and France.Among the characters that pass through this history are St Bernard of Clairvaux, the Abbot Segur, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, Saladin, King Philip Augustus of France, Thomas Becket, Popes Celestine III and Innocent III, and hundreds of nobles, knights, clerics, and others. This history is a pageant, but one played for keeps. Excommunications and interdicts were bandied about as frequently as harsh words; and every fight had an ecclesiastical dimension.Is your wife getting long in the tooth? Just get the clergy to declare that the marriage should be annulled because of consanguinity (which consanguinity was of course known by the kings who married their cousins). Just as he is about to wed Ingeborg of Denmark, Philip Augustus has second thoughts; and the outraged Dane betook herself to a nunnery and began a years-long letter-writing campaign that finally got the attention of Innocent III.After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the Normans held both England and a large part of France. The Capetian kings vainly tried to take pieces of France back from the Angevin kings Henry II and Richard, but only under John Lackland (appropriately named) did they begin to have any measure of success.Where was Eleanor in all this? To her 83rd year, she was a player. Although the chronicles tended to follow the kings, Eleanor was never far away. While Richard was being held for ransom in Germany, it was she who held the country together while John vainly attempted to forge an alliance with the enemy of his dynasty. Although Kelly's work is scholarly, she keeps her sources in unobtrusive endnotes that do not interrupt the flow of the text. If you want to read a history that is a real page-turner, I heartily recommend this book.One of the main things I learned from the book is that Richard the Lion-Hearted was not the great hero of the English as he has been portrayed. For one thing, he bankrupted the country twice, first with his crusade and then with his ransome, and he didn't even speak a word of English. And he preferred to spend his time in Normandy.

In the definitive 5-volume COMPLETE SAGAS OF ICELANDERS, Grettir's Saga is situated in the volume entitled &quot;Warriors, Outlaws, and Poets.&quot; For the story of Grettir Asmundarson, all three are appropriate. From an early age, the gigantic Grettir the Strong allows no man to show him disrespect without challenging him to a duel to the death. After one too many challenges, the combined Icelandic chieftains at the Althing sentence him to outlawry, which means, in essence, that anyone could kill him at any time without being held responsible.For a period of 19 years, Grettir moves from one part of Iceland to another, living on isolated farms or in the wild -- either alone or together with friends and sympathizers -- while relatives of those whom he had killed follow him around, setting up mostly unsuccessful ambushes. Finally, he settles on the islet of Drangey with his brother Illugi and a servant. One local farmer who owns the islet and the flock of sheep that feed there resorts out of desperation to having a magical spell placed on him that causes him to be injured, making it easy for him to kill the brothers.But because Christianity has taken root in Iceland, the chieftains are outraged at the use of magic to kill Grettir. The farmer is assailed on all sides until HE is declared an outlaw; and Grettir's half-brother chases him all the way from Norway to Constantinople avenge his death.Even while an outlaw, Grettir had visited many of the chieftains, including the legendary Snorri Priest of Eyrbyggja Saga fame, and met with sympathy. Had he lived another year, the decree of outlawry would have expired, and he would have been a free man. Grettir had good and bad qualities in abundance, including a ready wit and a meticulous sense of honor. His poems are razor sharp and earthy.Once you get past the Icelandic genealogies at the beginning, this saga reads more rapidly than any of the others I have read. It one of the most readable -- and loveable -- works of the entire Middle Ages.

First of all, it's not a compass; and it's not even made out of gold. But the American publishers decided that THE NORTHERN LIGHTS was not an appropriate title for U.S. audiences. Maybe we're too far south or something.Philip Pullman's trilogy -- HIS DARK MATERIALS -- is not an easy work to classify. It's not really a children's book, though many smart children have probably come to love it. It is a dark book, and most of the real evil in it is connected with the Magisterium, that is to say the theocratic world government.Picture to yourself a world in an alternate universe in which the only flight is in zeppelins; there are no automobiles; what we call electricity is newer and referred to as anbaric power. Even more unusual, everyone has an animal called a daemon which which they can communicate and without which they cannot live (the daemons can't live without their humans either).The Magisterium is headquartered in Geneva and seems to exercise absolute political control over much or all of the world. Mrs. Coulter, acting for the Magisterium's General Oblation Board, is arranging for the kidnapping of children for a nefarious purpose which I will not reveal here.We see the action of THE GOLDEN COMPASS, through the eyes of a young girl at Jordan College (nonexistent in our world), Oxford, named Lyra Belacqua. As it becomes apparent, she is the daughter of one Lord Asriel, a scholar-explorer, and the above-named Mrs. Coulter.When one of Lyra's play friends is kidnapped by the Gobblers (General Oblation Board), Lyra runs off to find him. Before leaving, she is given a device called an Alethiometer which acts like a ouija board in answering any question put to it by a series of Tarot-like symbols. Lyra becomes quite adept at reading the alethiometer, which helps get her out of some tight spots.She is helped in her quest by gyptians (Gypsies to us), who are also concerned about the kidnappings. The action moves northwards to the Arctic where, at Bolvangar, the General Oblation Board takes all the children that have been Gobbled by the Gobblers. There, Lyra enlists help from an armored warrior-bear named Iorek Byrnison who helps her find her friend.Where the book ends is really where the story of HIS DARK MATERIALS begins. There is a lot more to the story. And the further I went into it, the more involved I became. I have just now finished the second book,THE SUBTLE KNIFE, which for the first time enables me to understand THE GOLDEN COMPASS somewhat.Don't even get me started on the subject of dust, also referred to as Rusakov's particles in this volume. It won't be until you read THE SUBTLE KNIFE that you will understand what Pullman is trying to do. In this volume, however, it's something of a mystery which I will not attempt to do you a disservice by attempting to explain away.

What Buddhist burst of contemplation led to this great novel written by that &quot;technician,&quot; W Somerset Maugham? Of all the great books of the 20th century, which one could compare with its raw nerve and sinew? Here are no word games, no playing with the chronology, no obfuscation. With the limpid prose that had become his trademark, Maugham took us by the most direct route into his own private inferno.What in his hero Philip Carey was a clubfoot was for Maugham a painful stammer. What was Carey's public school at &quot;Tercanbury&quot; was Maugham's Canterbury. And, what is most interesting, what were Carey's tortured amours with the opposite sex were Maugham's tortured amours with the same sex. Yet with all the &quot;translation&quot; going on, the intensity of the feelings was transferred intact. The pain of Philip's on-again off-again relationship with Mildred has few equals in the literature of self-torture and self-delusion, ranking with Swann's pursuit of Odette de Crecy.OF HUMAN BONDAGE is a big book. There are hundreds of characters; and many of the lesser characters are memorable. The ineffectual dilettante Hayward, the skeptical poet Cronshaw, the icily bland Mildred, the despairing artist Fanny Price, the treacherous Griffiths -- even the walk-on role of grumpy old Dr. South comes alive in the last few pages of the novel.The settings are equally diffuse: London, the English countryside, Heidelberg, Paris, a Channel fishing village, and -- an amusing canard -- Toledo in Spain. (Carey is always dreaming of going there, but he never does.)When one is young, life looks like a triumphant progress through love, fame, and wealth. There appears, however, to be an inherent weakness in the organism; and it tends to go astray more than it does forward. We give ourselves to uncaring people; we constantly meet with reverses; we see our childhood dreams trampled by money-grubbing and the quiet desperation of which Thoreau wrote.And yet there is a spring that runs through us all. Even when it is dammed up, as Philip Carey's so often is, it can break out and rush forward, carrying everything in its path. When it happens deus-ex-machina style in BONDAGE, we are exhilarated (if not convinced). Maugham lets us down easily. He is too great and generous a writer to leave us in despair.Maugham's own story turned out well: he died rich, at an advanced age, and full of honors. His books are still in print and read by millions. What is more, Maugham, particularly in OF HUMAN BONDAGE, showed us what lay beneath the unperturbable veneer: We saw the skull beneath the skin.

The Rough Guide series is one of the consistently best collections of tour literature available anywhere. Previous guides I have used have been for France and Scotland, and both were excellent.On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the restaurant recommendations (though I did not have the opportunity of staying at any hotels this time) and I liked the organization of the beginning as a neighborhood-by-neighborhood tour of New York. Many guides are so Manhattan-centric as to leave a false impression of the Big Apple: This one was remarkably even-handed throughout.Curiously, the main problem was that, at times, the authors did not know whether to describe a particular tourist sight in terms of the neighborhood chapter or in terms of the museums chapter. At times, such as in the description of the Fraunces Tavern, one is sent scurrying between chapters. Other than this, I felt that this guide deserved five stars.The numerous black and white maps are of high quality, and the index is particularly useful given the book's organization. This one's a winner.

It is so strange to see a long, well-plotted novel suddenly come to a dead stop. (Of a projected twelve episodes, Dickens wrote six before his death.) The title character is either murdered or missing, and a large cast of characters in London and Cloisterham (Dickens's Rochester) are involved in their own way in discovering what happened to Edwin Drood.There is first of all John Jasper, an opium addict who suspiciously loves Drood's ex-fiancee; there is a nameless old woman who dealt him the opium who is trying to nail Jasper; there is a suspicious pile of quicklime Jasper notices during a late night stroll through the cathedral precincts; there is Durdles who knows all the secrets of the Cathedral of Cloisterham's underground burial chambers; there is the &quot;deputy,&quot; a boy in the pay of several characters who has seen all the comings and goings; there are the Anglo-Indian Landless twins, one of whom developed a suspicious loathing for Drood; there is the lovely Rosebud, unwilling target of every man's affections; and we haven't even begun talking about Canon Crisparkle, Datchery, Tartar, and a host of other characters. All we know is that the game is afoot, but we'll never know the outcome.It would have been nice to know how Dickens tied together all these threads, but we can still enjoy THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD because -- wherever Dickens was heading with it -- it is very evidently the equal of his best works. Life is fleeting, and not all masterpieces are finished.

Usually, a novel that splits right down the middle -- like a house divided against itself -- cannot stand. This one manages to, just barely. The first half is a raunchy romp with a Havana prostitute named Alicia, who manages to fall off her bicycle in an interesting way, and who strives to "trade up" toward a higher class of client. When she tangles with a shady international entrepreneur named Victor King, she finds her match until ...Well, I shouldn't say what happens midway through the book, if only because it is so surprising and outlandish that it should be experienced without any lead-in. Suffice it to say that, quite suddenly, one finds oneself in a standard crime caper novel of the shaggy dog variety. The author's style metamorphoses into another genre, and the lovely Alicia is relegated to a subordinate role.Only the ironic ending keeps me from downgrading the book to three stars. Daniel Chavarria obviously has talent as a writer, and has some of the juiciest sex scenes in recent literature, but he is no master of the genre. Paco Taibo, whose praise appears on the back, stands head and shoulders above him with his Hector Belascoaran Shayne novels. Yet I suspect that Chavarria is still young and has room to grow, and I look forward to reading his other works.

I have used both the 1999 and 2000 editions of this excellent guide, and can only say that it is the best of the lot, closely followed by the Lonely Planet and DK Eyewitness guides.What makes Steves' guides so useful is that he addresses himself to Americans who are not used to foreign travel with the principal goal of eliminating their fear by helping to get their feet wet. To this end, his guides are more PRESCRIPTIVE than DESCRIPTIVE.For a good DESCRIPTIVE guide, I would turn to another guide such as Lonely Planet or Rough Guide, supplemented, perhaps, by Rachel Kaplan's excellent &quot;Little-Known Museums In and Around Paris.&quot;A PRESCRIPTIVE guide like this will urge that you avoid the Madeleine, Opera Garnier, and Pantheon because they aren't worth it -- and don't bother with the Bastille, because it was torn down over 200 years ago. Steves concentrates on accommodations and restaurants in only three parts of Paris: Rue Cler (near the Eiffel Tower), the Marais, and the Rue Mouffetard area. That saves perhaps a hundred pages and makes the book more compact and easy to carry during a trip.One of the strong points of the book is the merging of material from Steves' useful &quot;Mona Winks&quot; art guide into his Paris book. &quot;Mona Winks&quot; shows how you can visit the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, the Cluny Museum (highly recommended), and Versailles without killing yourself. For the Louvre, as an example, he concentrates how you can devote your attention to parts of the Sully and Denon wings and see the key works in about 2-3 hours. (Okay, if you're a purist, don't flame me: You and I would, of course, devote more time -- but that's not the issue here.)For the most complete info on Paris, I would suggest you supplement Steves with two fantastic Internet resources: the postings on the rec.travel.europe newsgroup (especially by JACK), and the website of the RATP (which runs the Metro and buses in Paris) at http://www.ratp.fr

Jacob Burckhardt had one of those rare minds who could construct a new synthesis out of thought, government, art, and culture -- and who, for the first time, made it possible to talk about the Renaissance as a moment in the history of Western man.This is a very dense work with flashes of genius as well as long scholarly footnotes with extensively quoted Italian and Latin. In a book by a dullard, this would be excruciating. But Burckhardt is anything but as he manages his material like a Moscow taxi driver: by accelerating and then coasting. When you least expect it, another epiphany draws you in.Burckhardt's Renaissance was an incredible high in the history of mankind. The Medicis, Sforzas, and Malatestas strut their way through the history of the period; Dante, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bramante create works of the imagination that still overpower us; popes like Julius II, Alexander VI, and Leo X combine worldliness with spirituality (sometimes); and even the average man has a face and a voice for the first time.This book will make your blood race.

In the previous two volumes of IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, we have seen the young Marcel fantasize about love (in the persons of Gilberte and Albertine) and high society (in the person of the Duchesse de Guermantes). The bulk of THE GUERMANTES WAY's 819 pages is concerned with two parties involving the glitterati of fin-de-siecle Paris.At the party of the literary Mme de Villeparisis, Marcel gains his first admittance to the world of the nobility and gets invited to an evening of his prized Dutchess, whom he had gazed on from afar when she attended church services in Combray, amid the tombs of her ancestors. Sometimes, however, when you get your heart's desire, there is that nagging question: &quot;Is this all there is?&quot;At one point in the latter party, Swann says to Marcel that &quot;one can't have a thousand years of feudalism in one's blood with impunity.&quot; The novel ends with the Guermantes about to leave for yet a more empyrean social gathering, to which Marcel is not even sure he is invited. (As we see in the next volume, he is invited and does attend.) At the very end, the Duke puts off seeing a dying friend and begins carping about his wife's choice of shoes.We see the beginnings of Marcel's disenchantment with the social scene. Since this volume covers such a short span of time, we do not yet see the effect of his grandmother's death on the young narrator. We leave him, stunned and confused, at the threshhold of a personal triumph that has already lost much of its luster for him.As I re-read Proust's great series, I am struck by how much I missed the first time I read it years ago. Many reviewers are struck by the length of the scenes describing the parties, but now I find that there is so much going on, and so many undercurrents, that the interior action passes quickly. Most of the action takes place in Marcel's mind as he encounters these gods of society and their hangers-on as they duel for position in their circles.&quot;Thus I beheld the pair of them,&quot; muses Marcel, &quot;divorced from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women....&quot;

No, there are no fish-eating avians at Lord Emsworth's crenellated castle. There are, however, a plethora of plots involving two lovesick damsels and their beaux, a porcine pig-fancier, a walrus-mastachioed duke, the usual crocodilian sister, and, of course, the very obliging Galahad Treepwood. Oh, and there are numerous impostors, including a fake painting.There are, in fact, so many subplots that the aging Wodehouse left a couple of them hanging. One character (the ferret-like Chesney) seemingly exists only to push the Duke of Dunstable and Johnny Halliday down the Earl's grand staircase. And there is the obligatory theft (actually two: one successful and one not). There's a chauffeur named Voules who tootles a harmonica -- but of all there is the Empress of Blandings, multiyear winner in the fat pig division of the Shropshire County Fair.The story begins when the Empress, for the first time in recorded memory, refuses a potato proffered by the doting Earl. Before one knows it, Blandings Castle fills up with invited and quasi-invited guests and begins that delightfully Wodehousing grinding of the mill of the gods that leaves us all laughing, the crocodiles unsatisfied, and good to triumph over all.There may be better Wodehouses, and there are probably worse, but even a middling Blandings story is far better, dash it all, than 99.9999% of the cripple-crapple to be found on bookshelves. And you will feel better reading it. Dead certain, in fact.

I had read a review in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY extolling Alice Munro to the skies, so I decided to give her a try by reading this novel.Without a doubt, the praise is well deserved. If one just looks at a summary of the story by itself, it's another typical women's novel about relationships. What makes it so much more is the fineness and fitness of Munro's perceptions about the way real people think, feel, and express themselves. On the second page, Rose's biological mother says that she feels as if there were "a boiled egg in my chest, with the shell left on." She then proceeds to die of a blood clot on her lung. An image like that sticks in one's craw for many pages.Later, Rose takes a train trip through heavy snow to Banff: "The train crept along slowly, fearful of avalanches. Rose ... liked the idea of their being shut up in this dark cubicle, under the rough train blankets, borne through such implacable landscape. She always felt that the progress of trains, however perilous, was safe and proper. She felt that planes, on the other hand, might at any moment be appalled by what they were doing, and sink through the air without a whisper of protest."As we see Rose grow up, get married, get divorced, try as a single mother to hook up with skittish males, and make her way through a middling, muddling life path, we experience a rising crescendo of minor epiphanies. Munro's language always gives dignity to moments of embarrassment, frustration, and minor-key elation.After having second thoughts about her marriage to Patrick, she falls in love with him again as she sees the vulnerable nape of his neck as he, unknowing, studies in a library carrel. In the end, it turns out to be a bad move as Patrick gives up everything he held dear to become a carbon copy of his obnoxious suburbanite father. What saves the moment is that I can feel each such objective correlative deeply because I've made major decisions on equally shaky grounds.Munro knows the language of the heart in all its minuteness and treats every step and misstep with the same respect and even love. She is a superb writer, and I eagerly look forward to reading her other works.

Sicily is one of those places that has seemingly been picked clean by numerous waves of invaders, from the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Spanish, to in our own days the U.S. Army of Omar Bradley and George Patton. But was it really? There definitely remains a hard core of hardcore Sicilian-ness that finds its perfect expression in the mafia with all its traditions of silence, corruption, violence, and faithfulness onto death.But how does one approach such a vast reserve of secrecy? Australian expatriate Peter Robb has hit upon a kind of double helix organizing principle that involves slowly rotating around its subject matter from several different points of view. In this helix are mixed food, history, culture, art, landscape, and all that is Sicily. We find Giuseppe di Lampedusa, Lucky Luciano, the painter Renato Guttuso, Michele Sindona, and the Vatican enmeshed in a kind of dance of death. But in the end, we are no closer to proof that arch-politician Giulio Andreotti sold his soul to Uncle Toto Riina of the Cosa Nostra.Arriving at this proof is not Robb's goal. His spiralling book has taken it all in and fascinated us with stories of how the fork was invented, how di Lampedusa's talent was made known to the outside world, what happened to Palermo's Vucciria market, how Guttuso's friends were all kept from visiting the dying painter by a cabal of servants -- and perhaps by Andreotti?This maddening book that goes nowhere and everywhere lacks only two things (for which I blame the publisher): maps and photographs. I kept getting lost, but I never lost interest. The lines of Eugenio Montale that form the book's epigraph describe it all:History isn'tthe devastating bulldozer they say it is.It leaves underpasses, crypts, holesand hiding places.

In preparation for a trip to Italy, I began reading the accounts of famous travellers to that land: D.H. Lawrence, Charles Dickens, Tobias Smollett, and now Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. I had no great expectations but was knocked for a loop from page one.Never before had I encountered a questing mind quite like Goethe's. Almost from the moment to left Carlsbad in September 1786, he was noticing the geological structures underlying the land and the flora and fauna above it. He sits down and talks with ordinary people without an attitude -- and this after he had turned the heads of half of Europe with his SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER. Here he was journeying incognito, apparently knowing the language well enough to communicate with peasants, prelates, and nobility.One who abhors marking books I intend to keep, I found myself underlining frequently. &quot;In this place,&quot; he writes from Rome, &quot;whoever looks seriously about him and has eyes to see is bound to become a stronger character.&quot; In fact, Goethe spent over a year in Rome learning art, music, science, and even sufferings the pangs of love with a young woman from Milan.Bracketing his stay in Rome is a longish journey to Naples and Sicily, where he becomes acquainted with Sir Warren Hamilton and his consort Emma, the fascinating Princess Ravaschieri di Satriano, and other German travelers. One of them, Wilhelm Tischbein, painted a wonderful portrait of Goethe the traveller shown on the cover of the Penguin edition.The translation of W.H. Auden and Elizabeth Mayer is truly wonderful. My only negative comments are toward the Penguin editors who, out of some pennywise foolishness, have omitted translating the frequent Latin, Greek, and French quotes. I am particularly upset about the lack of a translation of the final quote from Ovid's &quot;Tristia.&quot; In every other respect, this book is a marvel and does not at all read like a work written some 215 years ago. It is every bit as fresh and relevant as today's headlines, only ever so much more articulate!

This was Honor&eacute; de Balzac's last great novel. Within a few more years, he would be dead of overwork. His last great scheme -- the marriage with the Polish Countess of his dreams -- finally came off, but poor Eveline Hanska had nothing on her hands but a ruined hulk of a man who had given everything for his art and had little left to give her.COUSIN BETTE is about "love in all the wrong places," to quote a popular country & western song. Baron Hulot d'Ervy is a former Napoleonic officer who now serves as an official in the Ministry of War. But mostly, he serves Cupid. At the start of the novel, his faithful wife Adeline is besieged by a rival philanderer who tries to make a play for her, even as the Baron is getting dumped by his current mistress Josepha -- who was taken away from him by none other than the C&eacute;lestin Crevel who is currently besieging his wife.Two very important things occur that set in motion a diabolical scheme for revenge on the part of a poor old-maid cousin living with the Hulots, one Lisbeth Fischer. She has a proteg&eacute; in a young Polish count named Wenceslas Steinbock who has shown some talent as a sculptor. Lisbeth has him practically caged up in his studio because she believes that (1) he has talent and (2) he might one day come to like her, though she is by far the older of the two. When Hortense, Baron Hulot's daughter, learns of Steinbock's existence, she becomes intrigued and takes some trouble to locate him, throwing a wrench into Lisbeth's plans when they fall in love with each other.Enter Valerie Marneffe, Balzac's most accomplished villain. A young housewife married to a complaisant older husband, she makes a play for Hulot, who sets her up as his mistress. But Valerie's ambitions in love are truly Napoleonic: she also snares Crevel, Steinbock, and a returning Brazilian ex-lover of hers called Montes de Montejanos. And probably a couple dozen more unnamed co-conspirators. Living in Valerie's house as her housekeeper, advisor, and mother confessor is none other than Lisbeth Fischer.When Valerie becomes pregnant, the real fun begins. She brazenly tells each lover that he is the father of the child, and each commits a princely sum for an annuity. (As in most Balzac novels, the trail of the money is fascinating to follow.)The over-leveraged Hulot is the first to fall. Even before meeting up with Mme Marneffe, he was teetering on the edge of bankrupty. he falls so hard that he has to go into hiding, even from his family. Curiously, Adeline actually manages to make a comeback in a small way, though she is apparently in the beginning stages of Parkinson's Disease.Marneffe's transgressions are now beginning to be talked about in society, and finally they catch up with her. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, but suffice it to say that not even Herod had a worse come-uppance than Valerie and her husband.And Lisbeth Fischer? She, too, is ultimately foiled: First, her desired beau, Field Marshal Hulot, commits suicide; and second, she herself sickens and dies, but without anyone ever discovering her treachery to the family.I have read COUSIN BETTE twice now, and it only grows better on re-reading. This is one of the handful of Balzac novels that stands at the pinnacle of literary greatness. The novel's vision of the ruin of great families from indiscriminate womanizing is almost cosmic.

In PHINEAS FINN, Anthony Trollope wrote about a happy-go-lucky young Irish Member of Parliament who romances the ladies and achieves a minor ministerial rank in the Liberal government. A dispute with his party regarding the Irish question, however, results in his leaving politics and returning to Ireland.PHINEAS REDUX brings Phineas back, but the slogging is now harder. The vicious infighting between Daubeny (Disraeli) and Gresham (Gladstone) has soured Phineas somewhat. He is repeatedly slandered by a yellow journalist named Quintus Slide; and many in his party, including some of his friends, believe that the Irishman is carrying on an adulterous affair with Lady Laura Kennedy. At one point, the aggrieved husband takes a pot shot at Phineas, but misses. Matters turn still darker when J. Bonteen, a political rival to Phineas, is murdered one night in the street shortly after a quarrel with Phineas at the Universe Club.The major set piece of PHINEAS REDUX is the trial of Phineas Finn for the murder of Bonteen. Opinion is evenly split on the question of his guilt and the issue seems to be in doubt until Mme Max Goesler, whose love Finn had rejected in the earlier volume, conducts her own investigation and produces evidence that turns the tide and results in a resounding acquittal.If Trollope were a lesser author, everything at this point would be all sweetness and light. Here, however, Phineas suffers what appears to be a nervous breakdown and contemplates pulling out of politics altogether. What Trollope presents us with is an updated version of the Book of Job, with the difference that Phineas averts his face from his new good fortune and concentrates on his losses. His good friends rally round the young M.P. and slowly wean him from his depression.The pot of gold at the end of this dark rainbow is Mme Max. Phineas proposes to the wealthy young widow and is accepted.

Of all the Nobel prizewinners in literature, the one who most elicits an uncomprehending reaction is the late Halld&oacute;r Laxness, Iceland's greatest writer of the modern era. In my reading, I have always attempted at times to cross the mainstream and see what lies beyond. Iceland is as far from the mainstream as you can get and still be part of Western Culture. What we sometimes forget is that almost a thousand years ago, Iceland was a literary giant; and some of the sagas that came from that island are among the greatest works of literature ever written.Laxness is therefore the recipient of a great tradition. Sadly, Iceland -- after discovering Greenland and North America and giving them up as a bad lot -- became a colony of Norway, and later of Denmark. The loss of hegemony coupled with the horrendous disasters of a mini ice age and catastrophic volcanic explosions led to a grinding poverty that drained the mind and spirit.WORLD LIGHT is at one and the same time the greatest Laxness novel I have read and also the most difficult. Its hero, the poet Olaf Karason of Ljosavik, is born into poverty and spends his youth as a foster child in a home utterly lacking in love. After being kicked out, he moves to Svidinskvik, where he becomes a ward of the parish. He writes poems in support of local Danish bigwig, Peter Palsson, whose grandiloquent &quot;Rehabilitation Company&quot; is behind a series of mostly abortive moves to improve the town's economy and morale. The young poet is so feckless that it is difficult to identify with him, but as the story progressed, I began to see his flaws writ large over the entire landscape.The cigar-chomping Danes go around either claiming &quot;I'm no Icelander, s'help me!&quot; or attempting to prove themselves the most patriotic Icelanders of all. We see Olaf's attempts at finding himself with an incredible array of characters, including Juel Juel Juel of Grim Hairycheek Ltd, Eternity-Dave (who only has three expressions: &quot;Jesus&quot; ... &quot;My Brother!&quot; ... &quot;Heave up!&quot;), a succession of women who share his bed and drive him to distraction, and a supporting cast large and odd enough to populate a Dickens novel.I did say earlier that I found this Laxness's most difficult novel. It is difficult to know where the author is headed, though at the same time I kept getting drawn into the complex plot with its thick undergrowth of transitory characters. In the end, I saw Olaf's fecklessness being mirrored in the fecklessness of the Danish colonial administration, and the fecklessness of a pre-Independence Iceland that felt lost, and indeed of all human beings cast adrift upon the waters into a cruel world that mocks the life of the spirit and ends all too soon in disorder and early sorrow.The translator of this edition, Magnus Magnusson, writes a beautiful clear English (that also comes across in his Icelandic saga translations). British readers may remember him as the TV host of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;You will not be disappointed with WORLD LIGHT if you just persevere. Poverty of life and spirit never makes for easy reading, but Laxness rewards the reader who stays with him.

Normally, I would recommend that a new Trollope reader would start with one of the longer novels like BARCHESTER TOWERS or THE WAY WE LIVE NOW. Although it is atypical for a Trollope novel, AN EYE FOR AN EYE is short, rather elegantly written, and a good book to read if you have no intentions of tackling the entire 47-novel Trollope canon.The aging Earl of Scroope finds it necessary to adopt a young relative by the name of Fred Neville as his heir. Because the bane of his family has been heirs marrying beneath them, he makes the young lieutenant swear to wed someone worthy of carrying on the Scroope line "sans reproche" (without reproach), which is the family motto.On a visit back to his barracks in Ireland, Neville decides to hire a boat and go shooting seals and seagulls. On the shore, atop the stunning Cliffs of Moher, he meets an attractive Irish widow and her beautiful daughter Kate. Naturally, he falls in love with the daughter despite rumors of an inappropriate father who was supposed to be dead.The action swings like a pendulum between Scroope Manor and the Cliffs of Moher. At one location, the Earl and his wife make him promised to find a suitable mate; at the other, Kate and her mother -- with the help of the old local priest Father Marty -- work on joining Fred and Katie in Holy Matrimony.Fred never can entirely make up his find. The final solution is some sort of bogus affair, in which Kate does not become Lady Scroope, involving perhaps a hushed-up marriage abroad. Naturally, this pleases no one.Without divulging the ending, we find Fred paying the price for his wishy-washiness. A classical tragedy in the mold of his earlier LINDA TRESSEL, AN EYE FOR AN EYE is well worth reading under any circumstances. It tends to stand sui generis, so don't expect it to resemble his most famous works.

Normally I'm a big fan of Rick Steves' works, but this is probably the weak link in the series. It is well written and very funny in parts as it roars through all of Western Civilization at supersonic speeds. My idea of preparing for a vacation is to read 20-30 books regarding the history, art, and literature of my vacation destination. In a way, it prolongs the pleasure of the trip.At the same time, I am aware that even a greater percentage of travelers are purely experiential: They like to plop themselves into the middle of a foreign culture and just wonder as they wander. For this type of traveler, EUROPE 101 is ideal: It gives you the bare essentials so that you don't come across like a total yahoo. If you are this type of traveller, then the book gets five stars.

Aside from the knock-'em-dead beauty of the photographs from the great days of Film Noir, this is a book about the dark currents that run beneath the mainstream of urban life in America. Think of it as a spelunker's guide to the caverns of the American unconscious.No, America cannot be explained by IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or THE SONG OF MUSIC. To me, first you have to account for the pain of Orson Welles's corrupt sheriff in TOUCH OF EVIL; the ambiguity of Bogart's character from IN A LONELY PLACE; the darkness of Dana Andrews's detective in Preminger's WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS; the terrible descent of Tyrone Power in NIGHTMARE ALLEY.These and other memories come welling up as I turn the pages of this wonderful book. Alain Silver and James Ursini have covered this same ground in other books, but with the aid of these images from the spiritus mundi of our misspent youths, it is like being hit in the head with a hammer. Good work, guys!

I had forgotten how good a novelist Cecelia Holland was until I picked up GREAT MARIA. Somewhere in Southern Italy, Maria, a young daughter of a Norman robber baron marries Richard d'Alene, an unprepossessing but ambitious young knight. Secretly, she prefers his more handsome younger brother Roger, but accepts her lot. Little by little, Richard increases his hold over the area by a combination of successful warfare and enlightened leadership. Maria gradually begins to share some of his power in Robert's absence and becomes indispensible to him. Finally, having defeated the local Saracens on the coast and his traitor brother Roger, Richard becomes a king and Maria his queen.As a history buff, I picked up my copy of John Julius Norwich's huge THE NORMAN CONQUEST OF ITALY and scanned the index for place names such as Iste, Agato, Mana'a (or Marna), and Castelmaria -- only to find that Ms. Holland invented them. As for Richard and Maria and Roger d'Alene, there was not a mention.Without being beholden to actual historical characters or locales, Holland gives you an excellent feeling for Medieval Italy. Richard and Maria are a contentious yet loving couple (though Richard sometimes comes across very like Charlotte Bront's Rochester in JANE EYRE). Maria herself is a complete creation, totally grounded, yet as bold in her way as any of the Norman knights.This is a superb book and highly recommended to all.

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1533-1592) was never famous for staying on topic. The titles of his essays, and this book is his longest essay, are pretexts for writing about what interested him at the time. If you don't know any more about Raymond Sebond after reading this essay than you did before, don't worry about it! If you gave it a slow, thoughtful read, you have experienced one of the greatest minds in all of history asking what was the value of man's mind to arrive at the truth.The answer could be expressed as the saying for which Montaigne is most famous: "Que scais-je?" or "What do I know?" Reason may be what separates man from the animals, but what benefit has man derived from it? Is he any happier for it? Is he any closer to the ultimate truth?As one who has loved the _Essaies_ (French for "attempts") for many years, my advice to readers is to take them a little at a time. Don't be put off by all the quotes from Classical Antiquity. This was, after all, the Renaissance; and Montaigne was, like many of his contemporaries, delighted to see reflections of his thoughts in the writings of the Greeks and Romans. (Rabelais in _Gargantua and Pantagruel_ did the same thing.) Many of those quotes are interesting enough to make we want to follow up on Lucretius, Cicero, Marcus Manilius, and others whose names predominate through the essay.Montaigne had the motto "Que scais-je?" inscribed on the walls of the tower on his property. He was the ultimate skeptic, but (forgive the pun) he essayed to explain his thoughts more thoroughly, perhaps, than any man who ever lived. I heartily suggest you read this, and follow it up with a reading of his greatest essay, "Of Experience."

I had no idea when I picked up this book that I had such a pleasant experience in store for me. Beginning in 1934, a young man in his twenties spends "three exquisitely happy years" in a China at the edge of the abyss. Japan had already invaded Manchuria and made no secrets of its intentions of further conquest. The shaky Chinese Republic was ruled out of Nanking; and Peking was still full of memories of the old Dowager Empress, the last of her line.The streets of Peking were full of Confucian scholars, aging palace eunuchs, adepts of Taoism and Buddhism, starving White Russian refugees, 14-year-old opium addicts, and gentle courtesans and flute girls. Blofeld threw himself headfirst into this world which was on the point of being snuffed out forever. Most memorable are the White Russian hermaphrodite Shura and the Rasputin-like Father Vassily; the decorous Buddhist scholar Dr Chang; Yang Taoshih, the Taoist sage, and his friend known only as the Peach Garden Hermit; the lovely courtesan Jade Flute; and the mysterious Pao, who elopes with a young girl intended for a Japanese colonel.After Blofeld leaves for a trip to England, the Japanese finally invade. There are two bittersweet chapters at the end where Blofeld revisits the scenes of his youth after 1945. His fragile Peking of the 1930s is now poised between a growingly thuggish Kuomintang secret police and the great unknown of Mao Tse-tung's Eighth Route Army.Blofeld's Dr Chang says it all: "Decay is inherent in all things, as Shakyamuni Buddha bade us always remember. Death swallows all that has been born; rebirth or re-creation follow in their turn, as spring follows winter. Things rise and wane in unceasing flux."CITY OF LINGERING SPLENDOUR is recommended to all sentient beings who were ever young once and are now faced with a confused welter of possibilities, none of which seem particularly appetizing.

Rachel Kaplan's engaging little book is a fascinating guide to some of the many museums in and around Paris that do NOT make it into the big guidebooks. Everyone has heard of the Louvre, the Orsay, even the Musee Rodin, but what about the others? Some of them are small museums run by devoted individuals; at least one (the Musee de la Marine in the Trocadero complex) is, I believe, run by the French government.This is a book badly in need of updating. Three years ago, when I used to to visit the Maison de Balzac on Rue Raynouard, the information on transportation, hours, and addresses was of relatively recent vintage and, consequently, more trustworthy.While Kaplan's contributions are wonderful and the many black and white and color photographs memorable, the publisher did a very mediocre job of presentation. I do not care for the book's alphabetic orientation and deplore the unhelpful single map.One more negative: There are many other small museums in Paris that are not even mentioned in passing, such as the Musee de la Serrure (locks, keys, and door knockers); Musee de la Poste (mail service); Musee Guimet (Oriental art); the new museum of Jewish history near the Pompidou Center -- to mention just a few.And yet, I look forward in a couple of weeks to visiting the Musee Delacroix and the Musee Cognac-Jay, neither of which appear in my other guidebooks. This is a very useful book for those who wish to explore lesser-known parts of the City of Lights. I look forward to a new edition which will make it even more useful.

Did Thomas Chatterton, one of the great forger/poets of the 18th century, die of an overdose of laudanum in 1770? Or did he fake his own death and continue merrily publishing work under the names of recently deceased poets?When novelist George Meredith posed as Chatterton in Henry Wallace's painting "The Death of Chatterton," is it true that the painter made off with his oblivious model's wife?In the present day, were the papers found by poetaster Charles Wychwood in Bristol really the confessions of Chatterton written in his own hand? And what about that painting of Chatterton as a middle-aged man? (He was supposedly 17 when he died.)Will literary "resurrectionist" Harriet Scrope succeed in taking Wychwood's work on Chatterton and passing it off as her own, just as Stewart Merk merrily signed the dead painter Seymour's name to his own work?Why am I asking so many questions?Because there are no answers. That's all right, though, because the questions are great; and they just keep on coming. If you read this book, you will sink deep into a morass of counterfeiting, fraud, and outright fakery.Be prepared to be bamboozled ... and entertained.

I now believe that Travis McGee, like all great detectives, exists outside of time. How can a novel written over 30 years ago speak to us so directly without reference to its era?In BRIGHT ORANGE FOR THE SHROUD, knight errant McGee rights wrongs committed by an impromptu consortium which exists to defraud and destroy its victim utterly. McGee flushes out the book's ultra-villain, Boo Waxwell, and does what he can to rectify the wrongs done to an innocent man. All, I might add, without reference to the Cold War, Carnaby Street, Hippies, or anything else which would have identified the book as a product of the Sizties.MacDonald's villains are the seven deadly sins, with an occasional personification of evil from the swamps like rapist-murderer-extortionist Waxwell thrown in. A wonderful read which I highly recommend.

Yasushi Inoue's SAMURAI BANNER OF FURIN KAZAN is written from the point of view of a short, old, and ugly samurai named Yamamoto Kansuke who serves as the chief military strategist for Takeda Haronobu, War Lord of Kai. He has an unerring gift of foreseeing how military strategies will turn out, and of fine-tuning the tactics required to position Takeda to win in any given situation.Well, almost any given situation. Kansuke also advises Takeda on matters of the heart, and here he is on shakier ground. While he has the best interests of the Takeda clan at heart, women have other goals in mind that he perceives only dimly, being a bachelor. As Takeda tires of his marriage. he takes on two concubines in Princes Yuu and Princess Ogoto; and the problems posed by these two beautiful young women almost prove to be his undoing.The most powerful enemy of the Takeda clan is Uesugi Kenshin of the nearby state of Echigo. His constant feints remind me of a superb defensive chess player who is familiar with the concept of "reculer pour mieux sauter" -- to retreat to gain running room for leaping forward. In the end, there is a final showdown at Kawakajima in the contested province of Shinano.Inoue ends with an ironic epilogue in which he sees all the efforts of the 16th century war lords come to naught as Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu finally succeed in unifying Japan in the next generation, leading to the 300-year Tokugawa Shogunate that lasted well into the 19th century.The title of the book comes from Takeda's battle flag, whose Chinese characters say, in effect:Be as swift as the windBe as silent as the woodAttack as fiercely as fireBe as composed as the mountainThis is a wonderful historical novel for anyone who, like me, loves the classic samurai films of Japan. It helps to provide the right historical context for the films. Inoue has done better, especially in LOU LAN AND OTHER STORIES, but this one is well worth reading as well.

With few exceptions (Cecelia Holland, Dumas Pere, and Robert Graves, for example) historical novels tend toward the gothic or didactic. WARDEN OF THE QUEEN'S MARCH was the first Tranter I read, and it moved me to run out and buy everything of his I could find in print.Tranter's novel tells the story of Mary Queen of Scots' reign from the point of view of a young Border lord, Thomas Ferniehill of Smailholm (or &quot;Smellum&quot; as the Queen calls him), who is passionately devoted to the Queen and is involved in several key junctures of her tragic reign. I believe that very few of the characters have been invented for the sake of narrative, and Tranter's depictions of James Stewart, Earl of Moray, and of the preacher John Knox are articularly memorable.The book covers the entire reign up to the start of Mary's captivity in England. Darnley, Bothwell, Rizzio, the &quot;Four Marys,&quot; Kircaldy, and all the greats (as well as the infamous) of Scotland during that troubled time make their appearance. And the character of Ferniehill makes an admirable filter for all the high melodrama of the times.

There are two kinds of guidebooks: There are the ones you use for planning a vacation, for background, history, photographs, insights into the people, the language, and various aspects of the society. This kind of guidebook is frequently lavishly illustrated -- though you might not want to take it with you. THE INSIGHT GUIDE TO ICELAND belongs to this category. It is printed on a nice glossy paper stock and weighs almost 2 pounds! That's about 8% of what I allow myself for total baggage for international travel.The other kind of guidebook is indispensible for its wealth of detail: opening hours of attractions, accommodations, restaurants, phone numbers, addresses, websites, e-mail addresses, and other info you would use &quot;in country.&quot; Lonely Planet and Rough Guide are probably the best examples of this category: I take a razor blade and neatly remove the sections I don't need and pack the mutilated remains with my bags.When I travelled to Iceland, I left my copy of the INSIGHT GUIDE at home. But I keep it to show friends where I have been and what a particular place looked like when it was NOT rainy or foggy. The photographs in this book are superb; the essays are of uniformly high quality; but it is short on up-to-date details. On the other hand, if you use it for planning or just armchair travel, you can't surpass it. It looks nicer than the Landmark Guide and the text is more interesting.As Lord Dufferin wrote some 150 years ago in LETTERS FROM HIGH LATITUDES, Iceland is a very different country when the sun is shining. Of course, you can't always get that: I saw some spectacularly awful weather at Stykkisholmur and Lake Myvatn, but I can appreciate a book that shows a country wearing its best finery. I plan to keep this book and refer back to it to plan future visits to this fascinating land.

In many ways, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE redux -- the main exception being that POSTMAN's greasy spoon is replaced by a cozy upper middle class Spanish suburban house. In both books, a man is inspired by a sexy, discontented married woman into murdering hubby for gain.POSTMAN's drifter is now a cocky insurance salesman (Walter Huff) who thinks he can both beat the odds and get the girl (Phyllis Nirdlinger), and -- why not? -- her daughter Lola as well. If you know anything about Greek tragedy, you can bet that the hubris mechanism is ready to spring into action with jaws agape.James M Cain writes a tight novella that can easily be consumed in a single sitting. It's just that you feel you've been watching cockroaches mate from a great height. Few of Cain's novels show the least sign of sentiment, let alone liking, towards their characters. Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder's script for the film is actually far superior because the character of Keyes is developed into a moral center around which the story unrolls. (It also helps that Cain's INDEMNITY has a really gonzo ending.)Nonetheless, Cain is what he is -- and his stories are always worth reading. But do see the Billy Wilder movie version!

The War of 1812 proved a great trial for the young United States. Not only did it include an effective British blockade on American shipping -- especially in the last year of the war -- but the Embargo Act of 1807 passed in Jefferson's second term led to a 90% decline in American exports before the war ever started. Across the country, wharves and warehouses were piled high with American goods and foodstuffs with nowhere to go.Who really wanted the war in the first place? It wasn't New England: Even while U.S. forces were engaged fighting the British in Canada, New England farmers made a good business selling beef to the enemy. The government in Washington was angry that American ships were being boarded by British warships and having crew members taken off because they "looked" like British deserters. The South was worried because the British forbade shipping cotton to Napoleon's France or to any of the mainland European countries he now occupied.Primarily, however, it was the West, which in those days meant Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio, which wanted to fight. The very thought that the British could interdict shipping down the Mississippi to the Port of New Orleans was a threat to the very existence of the newest of the United States. Henry Clay bragged in Congress that he could take 300 Kentucky militiamen and conquer Canada.That was not to be. The war on the ground took place in four theaters. It was the attempt to take Canada that was perhaps the biggest failure. Several U.S. armies came to grief because of bad military leadership, the unwillingness of militias to cross a national boundary, the inability to take advantage of a military victory (as at Lundy's Lane), and various other causes typical of green and poorly led troops. In time, good military leaders did emerge, especially Winfield Scott, but by then the focus was gone from Canada.The only real victories -- up until the very end -- were at sea. The duels between Old Ironsides and the Guerriere and Java stunned the British Admiralty. At Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie, Oliver Hazard Perry bested a flotilla put together by the British; and Commodore McDonough did the same at Plattsburg, NY, on Lake Champlain.The other two war theaters were Chesapeake Bay, in which the U.S. capital at Washington was put to the torch and Fort McHenry was bombarded, though little else of note occurred, and New Orleans. The latter, the only decisive victory by U.S. ground troops over British regulars (who had fought in Spain against Napoleon) took place after the peace treaty of Ghent was signed, but before the news of the signing had reached American shores.Borneman does a creditable job retelling the events of the War and the events leading up to it, complete with maps, footnotes, a useful bibliography, and illustrations of the major players. His conclusion that the war led to a national consciousness coming into existence, whereas before Americans thought of themselves primarily as residents of their states, comes at the tail end of the book. I would have liked to see a more detailed discussion of his hypothesis.By and large, however, I enjoyed the book enough to want to look into Borneman's other work. There are relatively few contemporary works about the period, and this one does do justice to its subject matter.

Why is it that some of the best fiction writing in English comes from India? Is it the educational system? the Commonwealth background? the adoption of English as a unifying language in a country that has so many languages? I wish I knew.Years ago, I started by reading R K Narayan at the suggestion of none other than Graham Greene. The more Indian fiction I read (Desai, Jhabvala, Roy, Seth), the more I became convinced that perhaps we must look to India for great English literature.I picked A FINE BALANCE up at the library and took it home because there was something about the book's cover that caught my eye. Needless to say, I was hooked by the richness of the book, which rivals Dickens in its multiplicity of characters and the love that is lavished on each minor character.This is a story of a young widow who takes in boarders and starts a home business to become independent of her controlling brother. We begin with two lower-caste tailors who escape from an oppressive village life to work for the widow, then the student who is to become her boarder, then the widow Dina herself. We travel back in time to see their lives up to that point, and then we are launched into the uncertainties of the present.A note: This is the India of Indira Gandhi around 1975-1980. Before her assassination, she instituted a number of Potemkin-style &quot;reforms&quot; that caused widespread suffering among the poor. At a number of points, her characters are ripped untimely from their everyday lives to create political theater that makes the powers that be look good to their Congress Party supporters.One of the minor characters is the wandering Vasantrao Valmik, a former proofreader into whose mouth Mistry puts his own thoughts about life. &quot;There is no such thing as an uninteresting life,&quot; he tells the student at the end of the book. He urges him to tell him his complete story, &quot;unabridged and unexpurgated.&quot; He continues: &quot;It's extremely important because it helps to remind yourself of who you are. Then you can go forward, without fear of losing yourself in this ever-changing world.&quot;One feels that Mistry, who now lives in Canada, uses writing to help remind himself of who he is. He brings his unnamed city -- which is undoubtedly Bombay -- to life with all its smells, its peeling paint, its worms in the shower drain, and its wealth of poor, but colorful characters.Colorful, yes, but also sad. Not everyone comes off well, even though you the reader may come to love these characters, and God knows I did, be prepared for many reverses. Although life is a game played for keeps, the love we meet along the way makes it all worthwhile.Rohinton Mistry is a major talent, and A FINE BALANCE is a great book.

It was a hot summer day, and I was in the mood for a sea story. I luckily picked up MEN AGAINST THE SEA and quickly became engrossed. Where the prequel, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, was a story of a mutiny, this one was one of the best men against the elements stories ever penned. We see a very different Captain Bligh, whose temper still flares up from time to time, but who this time is successful in managing a small crew of men in an open boat over 3,000 miles from the site of the mutiny to Timor, which is today part of Indonesia.Fletcher Christian and his mutineers allow Bligh and his loyalists no guns, three cutlasses, a small medical kit, and a pitiful store of water and victuals. Their boat must skirt all inhabited islands because they had no gifts to give to the natives -- which in the islands at that time meant that they were risking attack every time. Their water supply came from rainstorms and occasional landings for food. They had no gear for fishing. All they had to go on were Bligh's knowledge and guts.I actually prefer this book to MUTINY and now eagerly look forward to seeing if PITCAIRN'S ISLAND, the third volume in the trilogy, is as good.

My best friend's wife was in the hospital, and I was put in charge of their son for a few hours. I decided to tell him the story from memory of how Hernan de Cortez, with a handful of men, brought down an entire world. I had just finished reading Collis's book, and also Bernal Diaz's first-hand account of the same story and Prescott's able retelling in THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO, so it was still fresh in my mind. The boy was entranced.Maurice Collis's is by far the best telling of the story as such. (Prescott and Diaz are both worth reading if you have the chance.) I collect Collis and love everything I have ever read by him.There are, of course, two sides to every story. Cortez's gain was Montezuma's loss: And it was the Aztecs' loss. According to J. Eric S. Thompson in MAYA HISTORY AND RELIGION, approximately 80% of the population of what is now Mexico died of measles, smallpox, malaria and other diseases brought by the Spanish within a very short time. The Aztecs' sacred books were burned as heresy; their language (Nahuatl) is dying out; and the name and image of Montezuma are absent in the Mexico of today. Only Cuauhtemoc, who resisted Cortez and his lieutenants, is honored.Read this book and marvel at how tenuous a civilzation can be. It took Rome over a thousand years to fall: Tenochtitlan fell in a year.

You may remember Shelby Foote from his sonorous narration in Ken Burns's THE CIVIL WAR. He is also a respectable novelist and the author of an authoritative three-volume history of the Civil War from the point of view of the South.STARS IN THEIR COURSES is an even-handed look at the three days' battle that some think was the decisive struggle of the long conflict. At least, it would have been had it not been for Lee's rapid, orderly retreat and Meade's disinclination to face him in battle again so soon. If the more decisive Grant were in charge at that early date, the war would have drawn to a quick conclusion.As a big fan of Ted Turner's GETTYSBURG, I was surprised to see that the movie took at least as much from Foote as from Michael Shaara's THE KILLER ANGELS. Foote produces a more all-encompassing view of the battle than the film, which omits Ewell's actions on the Union right as well as the battle's immediate aftermath.My only complaint about the Modern Library edition is that the maps scattered throughout the text bear no captions. The reader has to check the List of Maps in the back of the book to find out where (and when) he is on the battlefield. An index would also have been useful.But these are mere peccadillos considering Foote's high level of scholarship and engaging prose style. This book is a keeper.

It has ever been John Adams's fate to have been passed over by reputations of the other Founding Fathers, men like Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and even Hamilton. From the earliest days of the Continental Congress, Adams was directly and actively involved. He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. With Franklin, he negotiated aid from the French that proved vital to our independence. He negotiated the first loan to the new nation from the Dutch. He negotiated the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution. He participated in the writing of the Constitution. He was the first Vice President, under George Washington. Oh, and he was also the second president of the United States.And yet, comparatively speaking, he has been shunted aside by history. In France, Franklin bad-mouthed him shamelessly. He was cold-shouldered by the British, who did not appreciate having to deal with their colonies as an independent nation. As Vice President, he was called "His Rotundity" and was slandered by Hamilton on the right (for not wanting to go to war with France) and Jefferson on the left (for being a monarchist, which he wasn't). As President, Adams had his opponent Jefferson as Vice President. The latter actively engaged a yellow journalist named William Cadwallader to fight Adams at every turn, though he himself was later gored by the same individual when he became President in 1800.When he finally left the presidency, Adams had another 26 years to live. He returned to his loving wife Abigail in Massachusetts and lived out the rest of his days as a gentleman farmer.What was unique about Adams and his wife was that they were able to express themselves so well and at such length in their correspondence. For much of his life, especially when he was in Europe, Adams lived apart from his wife and family and depended on the mails for communicating with them. Fortunately, most of this correspondence has survived. Later in life, he was reconciled with Jefferson and began an extensive correspondence with him, often writing four letters to Jefferson's one. These letters are precious historical documents.It was one of the ironies of fate that both Adams and Jefferson died on the very same day in 1826, and that day was the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence: July 4, 1826.The problem with most biographies is that the biographer becomes so wrapped up in advocating his subject that he loses perspective. To some extent, this is also true of McCullough. It doesn't matter very much, however, because Adams's life and writings are so fascinating; and the book does right an imbalance in the way that Adams has been treated by history.

Of the three map guides I have used to navigate Paris -- the other 2 being PARIS PRATIQUE PAR ARRONDISSEMENT and the little Blue Michelin map guide -- Middleditch's is by far the most beautiful. Metro stops, arrondissements, tourist sights are included; the maps are large and bright; the book is large, but not too large; and yet...To me, the most important thing a map guide could do is get me from Point A to Point B without too much time-wasting confusion in between. Where all the map guides fail is by not including good bus maps. The Metro is great, but you see only the dark underside of Paris; whereas a trip along Bus #69 will take you from the Eiffel Tower past the Louvre and Hotel de Ville through the Marais and Menilmontant to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery. A comparable trip along the same route underground would involve one more more of the dread &quot;correspondances,&quot; which are underground commuter rat races up and down stairs, ramps, and escalators to distant transfer points.This guide actually tries to suggest the different bus routes by including widely dispersed little red numbers which are impossible to follow closely. If you really have to use the bus, you'd have to print the &quot;plans de quartier&quot; and bus routes from the RATP's website .We had a whole sheaf of these route and quartier maps with us, so we enjoyed Paris to the utmost, taking the Metro only on Sunday and evenings, when the bus service winds down.One additional gripe: It would not have been terribly difficult to include taxi stations, as the Michelin maps do.Despite my criticisms above, the mapguide is excellent, but not that much better than the other two I mentioned. And I realize it would be much more difficult to do justice to bus routes (as they are so changeable), but the opportunity is there to make it a great guide.

The Founding Fathers of our country were long overdue for a send-up when bad boy Gore Vidal found the perfect perspective from which to view them, namely: Aaron Burr -- former Vice President, duellist, and indicted conspirator. Every schoolboy knows that Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel; and many know that Thomas Jefferson accused him of a vast conspiracy to separate the new American West from the fledgling United States.But did you know that, except for a minor skirmish at Trenton, George Washington never won a military battle (though he excelled in winning political conflicts)? Did you know that Washington, Hamilton, and Jefferson all died deep in debt? Finally, did you know that Martin Van Buren was probably Burr's illegitimate offspring? Through Burr's eyes, we see Thomas Jefferson as a bumbling would-be inventor who has dangerous tendencies toward absolutism, irrespective of his contributions to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.This is a lot of material to cover, and Vidal does it well by creating a framing story consisting of the last three years of Burr's life, roughly 1835-37. The story is told by one Charlie Schuyler, a would-be writer, journalist, and lawyer who takes up with the Black Sheep of American History and works at writing his biography from papers loaned to him by Burr. We read these papers ourselves, interspersed through the current-day narrative.Gore Vidal has that greatest of narrative gifts, of always being able to answer &quot;What happened next?&quot; to the satisfaction of his readers. He is comfortable with complicated skeins of narrative material and works it into a unified whole so that it almost reads as a history of the republic from 1776-1808, with a coda set some 30 years later in the waning days of Jackson's administration.I have always shied away from reading about the birth of our country because I was put off by the haloes attached to our country's founders. Vidal knocks those haloes awry while yet exhibiting a sense of wonder that, somehow, it all worked out. I am reminded of D. H. Lawrence's STUDIES IN CLASSICAL AMERICAN LITERATURE -- another bad-boy attack on the good, grey early days of our republic.You can still love your country knowing that George Washington used so much powder in his wig that he walked with a nimbus around his head and considerable fall-out on his shoulders.

Pratchett's EQUAL RITES is hilarious from beginning to end. An illiterate 9-year-old witch's assistant, Eskarina (or just Esk) Smith, is by an odd mischance left with a wizard's staff and decides she wants to become a wizard. That upsets the wizards of the Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork because it's somehow against the &quot;lore,&quot; though no one could quite find the exact reason why. She is aided by Granny Weatherwax, her witch mentor, who is one of the most fully realized comic characters this side of Dickens.For instance, she finds lodgings &quot;on the top floor next to the well-guarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because, as Granny had heard, good fences make good neighbors.&quot; Pratchett abounds in wonderfully graphic puns and felicitous expressions: &quot;The air was full of the busy silence of the night, which is created by hundreds of small furry things treading very carefully in the hope of finding dinner while avoiding being the main course.&quot;I won't say what happens, because that would be telling. This is the first of Pratchett's novels set in Ankh-Morpork. Pratchett is never more comfortable than describing this congenial hellhole. (For example: &quot;There was also the distinctive river smell of the Ankh, which suggested that several armies had used it first as a urinal and then as a sepulcher.&quot;)Some day when you are really down and need a wondrous lift, pick up this story of how Granny Weatherwax helped Esk become a bona fide wizard.

The GONCOURT JOURNALS are by far the absolute best single book you can read about what it was like to be alive in the Paris of Napoleon III. Edmond and Jules de Goncourt were brothers who knew where all the skeletons were buried. They were on close terms with many of the Impressionist painters like Edouard Manet, the nobility (Princess Mathilde de Bonaparte), poets (Paul Verlaine), and writers (Flaubert, Zola and de Maupassant). Although no mean novelists themselves (GERMINIE LACERTEUX), the Goncourt brothers are best known for their journal.Just a couple of selections to whet your appetite:&quot;Talk about perfumes led to a mention of the scent of vanilla that hangs around Frederick Lemaitre, who has pods of it sewn into his coat-collars, and who was nearly poisoned as a result of his habit of kissing the hair of the actors he plays with, for he kissed Mlle Defodon, who used to put gold dust in her hair, and breathed in that powdered copper.&quot;&quot;There have been many definitions of beauty in art. What is it? Beauty is what untrained eyes consider abominable. Beauty is what my mistress and my housekeeper regard as abominable.&quot;&quot;A book is never a masterpiece: it becomes one. Genius is the talent of a dead man.&quot;The Grand Boulevards of Baron Haussmann come alive, along with the smells and sounds of that strange seminal time in which so many great talents were beginning their rise to greatness. Dip into this book at any point, and you will only whet your appetite for more.

Travel with Robert D Kaplan to the back of the beyond. Stay in grim hotels with broken toilets and damp, furrowed beds. No, the management will not give a damn for your comfort. And don't bother hailing a policeman: He will shake you down for cigarette money, ask why you are there, and put you through a bureaucratic nightmare grilling. Except for Turkey and Israel, the countries which Kaplan visits are run by mafias, megalomaniac dictators in the Saddam Hussein mold, or ex secret policemen (hint: these are the best run).We are so simplistic because of our Eurocentrism: Our textbooks ignore 80% of the globe. Ask your children where Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan are located and who their neighbors are. Better book up, kiddies, or you may be hauling RPGs and messkits there in defense of tomorrow's oil.The common element in all these countries is that they are places were ethnicity is complex. Look for more ethnic cleansing on a scale which makes the former Yugoslavia look like a church social. Give these people democracy? Don't forget that Slobodan Milosevich was, after all, a democratically-elected leader, and look what he did! Democracy CAN be a license to kill your neighbor.Kaplan's greatest value is to educate his readers on the dangers of simplistic solutions. Read him, and you will no longer reel with sucker punches as different parts of the world emerge from nowhere to suddenly become angry crisis zones demanding our immediate attention. "Self-interest at its healthiest," writes Kaplan, "implicity recognizes the self-interest of others, and therein lies the possibility of compromise. A rigid moral position admits few compromises."

Bernard Lewis, a Professor Emeritus in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University, has created yet another incredibly useful and timely book from articles he wrote for the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs, the Atlantic Monthly, and other publications.THE CRISIS OF ISLAM -- even more than its excellent predecessor WHAT WENT WRONG? -- is both cohesive and spot-on. All nine chapters as well as the introduction are informed by the events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath. The final chapter, for instance, deals directly with the subject of suicide bombers, discussing the Qur'an's ban on both suicide and murder of innocent civilians, and going on to discuss the "martyrs" of Hammas and the Al-Aqsa Brigades as a form of death cult that goes against the teachings of Islam.I was particularly intrigued by Lewis's reference to some remarks made by Osama bin Laden regarding the "humiliation and disgrace" Islam has suffered for over eighty years. He refers specifically to the abolition of the Caliphate by Kemal Ataturk and his followers in 1924. For the first time since the days of Muhammad, Islam was without a leader. Lewis suggests that Osama would not be averse to the role himself -- which would be roughly equivalent to making Jeffrey Dahmer the headmaster of a boys' school.The chapter entitled "A Failure of Modernity" gives striking evidence of the backwardness of most Islamic nations. A 2002 United Nations report states that "the Arab World translates about 330 books annually, one-fifth of the number that Greece translates. The accumulative total of translated books since [the ninth century] is about 100,000, almost the average that Spain translates in one year." If we in the West have been accused of the oddest things at times, it is because ignorance of the West is endemic. And, I might add, dangerous.In order to avoid falling into the same trap ourselves -- such as by getting all our information from "The O'Reilly Report" -- we owe it to ourselves to know why over a billion Muslims have decided that we are the Great Satan. Knowledge is more powerful than an arsenal of MOABs.

To begin with, Victor Serge (1890-1947) is an anomaly. He is a Russian revolutionary and political agitator who just happened to be born in Belgium and who wrote most of his books in French. He is not widely read today because most of his books fall under the heading of politics, yet he wrote seven novels of which THE CASE OF COMRADE TULAYEV is perhaps the best known. He comes from a family of socialists, one of whom was involved in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. During the Russian Revolution, he took part in the siege of Petrograd and knew Lenin personally. (His wife was one of Lenin's stenographers.) He ran afoul of Stalin, who had him arrested for being a Trotsykite. After years of imprisonment, he was one of the few writers ever released by Stalin in response to international pressure from Andr&eacute; Gide and other European cultural figures. Later, he was also "excommunicated" by the exiled Leon Trotsky as an anarchist. Always on the edge of poverty and now on the outs with the Communist Party in all its many flavors, he wound up in Mexico after Trotsky's assassination and worked on a biography of the slain leader. In the end, the high altitude proved too much for his heart, and he died in 1947 while in the back seat of a Mexico City taxicab.THE CASE OF COMRADE TULAYEV has been reprinted in the excellent Willard R. Trask translation by New York Review Books, with an introduction by Susan Sontag. Although there have been other novels about Stalin's purges of the 1930s--most notably Arthur Koestler's DARKNESS AT NOON--nothing comes close to Serge's treatment. His story begins with two bachelors in Moscow who share adjacent rooms in an apartment building. On a sudden whim, one of them, the fusty Romachkin, buys a pistol and takes to carrying it around on his nocturnal rambles through the city. One day, just outside the Kremlin, he is shocked to find himself within a few feet of Stalin himself. Realizing that he could have taken out and shot the dictator before his bodyguards could intervene, he goes home and hands the gun over to his neighbor, Kostia, who also takes to walking around at night with it. When Kostia sees one of the more repressive members of the Central Committee, one Comrade Tulayev, getting out of a chauffeured limo to walk the extra few blocks for a clandestine tryst with his mistress, he shoots and kills him and gets away.In the chapters that follow, the murder of Comrade Tulayev, whom we never really get to know, extends like a ripple through the upper levels of the Russian leadership. It is said that the character of Tulayev was inspired by Sergei Kirov, who was reportedly murdered at the instigation of Stalin. As in the case with Kirov, Stalin puts unrelenting pressure on his political bosses to find the culprit or culprits, even if they have to manufacture them:"The case ramified in every direction, linked itself to hundreds of others, mingled with them, disappeared in them, re-emerged like a dangerous little blue flame from under fire-blackened ruins. The examiners herded along a motley crew of prisoners, all exhausted, all desperate, all despairing, all innocent in the old legal meaning of the word, all suspect and guilty in many ways; but it was in vain that the examiners herded them along, the examiners always ended up in some fantastic impasse."Each of the major figures thus framed gets a chapter to himself in Serge's novel. Some of these chapters, such as the ones on party boss Artyem Makeyev ("To Build Is to Perish") and the character known only as Deportee Ryzhik ("The Brink of Nothing"), almost rise to the level of poetry. Makeyev is one of those talentless people who rise to the top through sheer consistency and brute strength. One day, he is visited by an old comrade, who for the first time plants the seeds of doubt in his friend's mind:"Artyemich, I have been thinking things over. Our plans are 50 to 60 percent impossible to carry out. To carry them out to the extent of the remaining 40 per cent, the real wages of the working class will have to be reduced below the level they reached under the Imperial Government [i..e., the Tsar]--far below the present level even in backward capitalist countries... Have you thought about that? I fear not. In six months at most, we will have to declare war on the peasants and begin shooting them down--as sure as two and two makes four...."As he goes backstage at a Moscow theater, Makeyev is picked up by the security services and whisked off, uncomprehending.At the beginning of his chapter, Ryzhik is a prisoner in exile in a tiny hamlet in a godforsaken part of Siberia:"Incomparable dawns rose for Ryzhik from the profound indifference of desert lands. He lived in the last of the five houses which made up the hamlet of Dyra (Dirty Hole), at the junction of two icy rivers lost in solitude. The houses were built of unhewn logs which had come down in the spring drives. The landscape had neither bounds nor landmarks. At first, when he still wrote letters, Ryzhik had named the place the Brink of Nothing ... He felt that he was at the extreme limit of the human world, at the very verge of an immense tomb. Most of the letters he wrote never reached any destination, of course, and none came from anywhere. To write from here was to shout into the emptiness which he sometimes did, to hear his own voice...."Even so, the long arm of Stalin's prosecutors reaches him as a possible person to frame for the Tulayev murder, and he is whisked off to Moscow. He escapes having to admit his guilt only by cleverly going on a hunger strike unknown to the guards. He slowly feeds all his meals to the toilet until he is too weak to confess to anything and escapes further interrogation by his suicide.In the end, three of Stalin's former associates are framed and executed. After a candid confrontation with the whimsical Stalin, one suspect is assigned to supervise a gold extraction operation in Siberia. As in the French Revolution, even the prosecutors and their stooges are picked off one by one and ground up in the mills of what passed for justice during those perilous times.You will not find Victor Serge filed under Russian literature. You will not find him under French literature. You are not likely to find him at all unless you are extraordinarily fortunate. Reading The Case of Comrade Tulayev has whetted my appetite to hunt down other works by this most elusive of writers.

Ever since I first read THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS over twenty years ago, I have enjoyed Paul Theroux's travel books and regarded them as the best of their genre -- at least among contemporary authors.Africa presents a particular challenge for travelers. If you read the papers, you will find virtually no good news from the Dark Continent. Instead, there are stories of genocidal massacres (Ruanda and Burundi), slavery (Sudan), tribal violence (most countries), rampant AIDS (everywhere), child prostitution (Djibouti and Mozambique), terrorism (Egypt and Sudan), civil unrest (Zimbabwe), rampant crime (South Africa), and so on ad infinitum. Fortunately, Theroux had spent some time in Africa in his youth and still possessed a smattering of the local languages. And he had an incredible amount of courage and fortitude.(One of Theroux's forebears along much of the route was Michael Palin of Monty Python fame in his entertaining &quot;Pole to Pole&quot; series of documentaries. But then, he went along with a large film crew and could afford to pay the baksheesh required to satisfy the ravenous officialdom along the route.)Theroux traveled by ferry boat, canoe, train, bus, taxi, truck, van, foot -- in fact everything but bicycle or airplane -- from Cairo through the Great Rift Valley to South Africa, with a few interesting detours. Except for a foiled hold-up attempt in Kenya, he managed to avoid most problems by asking the locals he met questions about the road ahead. Whenever his informants said &quot;there are bad people there,&quot; he made whatever adjustments he could; but most times he just relied on his considerable street smarts and managed to get by unscathed.In addition to the &quot;bad people&quot; one expects, there were a surprisingly large number of good-hearted people who helped Theroux without any expectation of return. In fact, the only group of people he unilaterally slams are the international aid workers with their bright new Land Rovers -- refusing all eye contact and associating only with one another. Even the missionaries prove to be more helpful. His comments in this area were quite an eye-opener to me: I had not realized what a failure five decades of international aid had proven to be.I devoured this book in three sittings and was greatly saddened when it came to end. Theroux has changed forever my view of Africa. Although there is no bibliography, I appreciated the author's frequent references interspersed throughout the text to other background works on the subject.

Anthony Trollope's 47 novels contain many surprises, one of which is this delightful novel, which bears one of the most unlikely titles in all of literature. There is no better way to leave the megrims by the wayside than to immerse yourself into another time and place. Trollope was the Victorian story-teller par excellence. After having read a quarter of his vast output, I have yet to discover a clinker in the bunch.A notorious curmudgeon, the Marquess of Brotherton has quitted England for the sunny shores of Italy. News filters back to his relatives that he has married an Italian and fathered a male heir, given the courtesy title of Lord Popenjoy. His mother and siblings are in a tizzy, as they are asked to quit the premises of the ancestral home to make way for a return of the prodigal head of the family with wife and heir.It seems, however, that there is little news and much doubt about the legality of the Marquess's nuptuals; and therefore doubt as to whether his so-called son is actually the heir Popenjoy.There is a delightful fox hunt (common to many of Trollope's novels), and a stormy marriage between the Marquess's young brother and a clergyman's daughter. She dares to dance the forbidden Kappa Kappa (the Lambada of its day) with a young wastrel, and raises the protective ire of every duenna within a hundred mile radius.Look for some very amusing -- and controversial -- put-downs of the emerging feminist movement.This is a good book to start reading Trollope. His two long series -- the Barsetshire and Palliser novels -- require a long commitment. Popenjoy is just right!

The year is 1591. Sultan Murat III rules an empire that stretches from the Danube to the Nile, from the Barbary Coast of Algeria to the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates. As a patron of the arts, the Sultan commissions an illuminated manuscript that comes close to violating the Koran's ban on the depiction of living creatures.At the Last Judgment, those who have depicted men and animals will be required by Allah to bring them to life. As they cannot but fail to usurp this function of the Creator, they are cast into hell for their mimicry of His divine powers.The tight world of those few artists who are executing the Sultan's commission glance fearfully over their shoulders as a fundamentalist cleric, the Nusret Hoja of Erzurum, mounts an increasingly violent campaign against the "blasphemers" and "heretics." When the body of Elegant Effendi, the well-known gilder of manuscripts is found dead in a well, the artists decide to take action.It is the second death, that of Enishte Effendi, that finally results in action. The miniaturist (as these artists are referred to throughout the book) known as Black is enlisted by Enishte's daughter Shekure to find the killer. Black had loved Shekure for many years unrequited, but with Enishte gone, Shekure promises to marry him if he succeeds.In his novel THE BLACK BOOK, the author writes: "... the only way to be one's self is by becoming another or by losing one's way in another's tales." Orhan Pamuk in this novel tells his story through the mouths of twenty narrators, ranging from the main characters to the corpse of Elegant Effendi, the color red, a dog, a horse, Satan, Death, a tree, an unnamed woman, and so on. Where this technique could be expected to fragment the tale so that it becomes difficult to follow, here it succeeds brilliantly. The story passes from one narrator to the other almost seamlessly, and the trail is never lost.One result of this technique is an incredible feeling of density and richness. Sixteenth century Istanbul is depicted here from its beggars to its coffee shops and wandering clothing merchants. From the Sultan's palace to an eerie abandoned dervish lodge, we see the gamut of Turkish society at the height of its power -- and at a point where it was beginning to be influenced by its old enemy, Christendom.In the afterlife, Enishte hazards to ask Allah a question:"Over the last twenty years of my life, I've been influenced by the infidel illustrations that I saw in Venice. There was even a time when I wanted my own portrait painted in that method and style, but I was afraid. Instead, I later had Your World, Your Subjects and Our Sultan, Your Shadow on Earth, depicted in the manner of the infidel Franks."Enishte does not recall the deity's voice, but the answer comes through loud and clear:"East and West belong to me."He hazards one more question, about the meaning of it all. This time, the one word answer sounds like "mystery" or "mercy" -- he is not sure which.This is a great novel that deserves to be read by anyone who seeks by understanding to bridge the widening rift between our civilizations.

Forget Parson Weems and the cherry tree. Forget the mechanical wonders of Monticello. Forget the powdered wigs and the wooden teeth and the stately poses. This is the beginning of American history as it really was -- and apparently not all those truths were quite so self-evident in the end.Joseph Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS is by far the best book I have read about the founding fathers (for a close second, see Gore Vidal's mischievous novel BURR). America's hard-fought liberty was no waltz, even after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown and even after the Articles of Confederation were replaced by the Constitution. Ellis shows that we just squeaked by, by the skin of our teeth.The French Revolution, for example, shook our young country to the core. Some well-known leaders (like Jefferson) were all for supporting the French even if it meant fighting England again. Adams' Alien and Sedition Acts, the XYZ Affair with its (surprisingly contemporary) undertones of bribery and scandal, and England's unwillingness to see us as a separate nation -- all made the approach of the 1800 election a make-or-break affair for the young nation.Then there was slavery. As early as 1790, abolitionists almost precipitated the immediate secession of South Carolina and Georgia. The only way the fracas was delayed was that Congress agreed to disagree and not do anything about it until the Missouri Compromise of 1820. In the meantime, the United States had grown stronger and was less likely to split apart at the seams.Despite the history textbooks, Thomas Jefferson does not emerge as one of the good guys of our early years. He had an ability to speak out of both sides of his mouth and flood the media with spin that would make his fortune in today's DC scene. His attacks on John Adams while professing friendship are a model for contemporary sleazebag politicians. (There is a fascinating coda: After Jefferson left the presidency in 1809, he and Adams picked up their friendship where it left off -- and both men died within 5 hours of each other on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence!)Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, who for some reason are at the beginning of the book, were both sleazebags of a sort. If Burr hadn't shot him in a duel, Hamilton's reputation may well have taken a dive on the basis of his shady maneuverings. And by winning the duel, Burr paradoxically was the big loser. It is not Burr's picture that appears on the $10.00 bill.Curiously, George Washington comes off the best of the founding fathers. Although he was not the world's greatest military leader, there was a universal feeling that if there should be a first president of the United States, it would have to be either George or no one. Except for some contretemps in his second term (the Whiskey Rebellion, for example), George left office smelling as sweetly as he did the day he took office. And his "Farewell Address" (it was never actually delivered, just printed in newspapers) showed that his vision for the 20 years following the presidency was dead right.This is a tremendously entertaining work as well as an enlightening one. A superb read that easily deserved its Pulitzer Prize.

One of the epigrams at the beginning says it all. It is the poet Fernando Pessoa speaking: "If they were to tell me that it is absurd to speak thus of someone who never existed, I should reply that I have no proof that Lisbon ever existed, or I who am writing, or any other thing whatever it might be."You might as well know this from the start, as Saramago doesn't reveal it in the book: Ricardo Reis is a fictional character invented by Pessoa before he died in 1935. Saramago picks up Pessoa's character, treats him as a real person, and has him return to Lisbon upon hearing of Pessoa's death after a sixteen years' absence in Rio de Janeiro. Who should show up but the ghost of Pessoa, who returns from time to time to have ironic (and deep) conversations with Reis until a point nine months after his death, after which he loses the ability? I will not reveal the surprise ending.During his last year in Lisbon, Reis keeps picking up a mystery novel he had purloined from the library of the ship that had brought him over: Herbert Quain's THE GOD OF THE LABYRINTH but never seems to get very far. At this point, I refer you to Jorge Luis Borges' story entitled "A Survey of the Works of Herbert Quain," who is, together with his book, wholly fictional.In the midst of all these in-jokes, the amazing thing is that you can read YEAR OF THE DEATH without knowing of them and still regard it as one of the greatest works of fiction written in the last century. Ricardo Reis is a brilliant creation (whoever's it is), and Saramago brings him to life and sets him wandering the streets of Lisbon and agonizing about his love life and about whether he is to take up his medical practice or just retire. We see him from his point of view, from Pessoa's, from a hotel manager's, from the police's, and even from his neighbors and a couple of old men who hang out in the park across the street. What emerges is the most multidimensional characters in all of literature.In the meantime, Europe is blowing up all around him. Spain erupts in civil war; Hitler's Germany invades the Sudetenland and begins threatening Danzig; and Mussolini has just completed a splendid conquest of Ethiopia. Little Portugal seems proud of its dictator Salazar, who was to continue for another thirty years, and hopes to get into the act, but can't decide what color its adherents should wear. The Nazis had brown; the Italians, black; and the Falangists, blue. (They finally settle on green.)There are as many news items in YEAR OF THE DEATH as in John Dos Passos's USA trilogy. Saramago's political news and views drip with irony: The Portuguese are innocents about to view a vast bloodbath that spreads from its border with Spain to the steppes of Russia, but it hasn't occurred yet.This is the second Saramago novel I have read, but by no means the last.

For the first two thirds of the book, we are cast headlong into a confused world of materialistic politicians, posturing socialists, and over-precious intellectuals. This mirrors the perplexity that the young Ugla finds when she leaves the North of Iceland to live in Reykjavik as the serving girl to a powerful member of parliament.I could have laid the book aside, but I had read Laxness before and was curious to see where he would take me. Ugla becomes pregnant and returns to her family in the country to have her child and think things through and, in her words, &quot;to become a person.&quot; From crazy Reykjavik, we suddenly find ourselves in the clear light of the great Sagas of the 13th century. Here there are no harsh moral judgments; and even the Lutheran pastor refers to Gunnar of Hlidarendi in NJAL'S SAGA as being on the same plane as the Good Book.As a hardened Saga fiend, I was enthralled. Here was an Icelander saying that the answer to the topsy turvy world of Cold War Europe was to look at the past and within onseself -- to follow the God who, by definition, was the one left over when all the other ones have been named.Ugla finds her way in the end -- even if she traced a great circle in the process. Like G K Chesterton, Laxness is a great optimist; and he left this reader with a smile and the resolve to read more of his works.

There are several epic sagas of exploration in the present-day &quot;lower 48&quot; United States. Chronologically, the first was Cabeza de Vaca's 1527-35 trek from Florida through the American Southwest and into Mexico. Then there was the journey of Lewis and Clark in 1803. Finally, there was that insane one-armed army major who with nine companions floated down the unmapped Green and Colorado rivers.Having read and enjoyed John Wesley Powell's own book about his 1869 expedition, I was shocked to hear that is was written decades after the events had taken place. Time had added an optimistic, even roseate glow to what was actually one hundred days of hell on earth with a crew that was grumbling and even mutinous at times. Instead of basing his book exclusively on Powell's book, he used the actual diaries written by Powell, Bradley, and others at the time to round out his tale.No doubt, you know that thousands of people of floated down the Colorado in recent years. But Powell and his men used keeled rowboats in which the men with their oars faced the rapids with their BACKS. In other words, they were facing the wrong direction most of the time. When they undertook the journey, they had no way of knowing whether there were waterfalls that would plunge them to their deaths. (There is one such waterfall on the Little Colorado, which feeds into the Colorado proper south of Lee's Ferry.) As it was, irrespective of how much they grumbled, Powell saw all his men landed safely, except for the three who abandoned the party at Sepration Canyon and were mysteriously murdered by Indians or (possibly) paranoid Mormons who disbelieved their story of running the Colorado.Dolnick's descriptions of the perils of white-water running rival Krakauer's descriptions of climbing Everest in INTO THIN AIR or the tempest in Sebastian Junger's THE PERFECT STORM. The author's attention to detail and apparent knowledge of his subject made DOWN THE GREAT UNKNOWN a joy to read.My only real complaint is that Dolnick interrupts the journey with a multi-chapter flashback of Powell's experiences at the battle of Shiloh, where he lost his arm. The matter, however interesting in itself, should have been introduced earlier, along with more background information about his crew, rather than interrupting the main narrative. My only other complaint is that I would have preferred standard superscripted numerical endnotes to the phrase cues he uses; and I would have preferred a better map of the entire expedition that appears on the endpapers of the hardback version.Still and all, this is a superlative page-turner that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in American history or even tales of adventure.

Returning to the Hi-Lo country of New Mexico after World War II, two cowboys (played by Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup) resume their friendship. That friendship is compromised when both fall hard for the lusty young wife (Patricia Arquette) of a competing ranch's foreman. Crudup is forced to suck it in as Arquette appears to prefer Harrelson; and it poisons the possibility of a relationship with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who detects that his love for her is divided.This is the New West, where small ranches are being gobbled up by larger ones such as that run by Sam Elliott, whom the other cowboys hate and fear. The work is hard and dangerous and the rewards few. But the Old West lurks not far beneath the surface, and bullets still fly.Director Stephen Frears did a magnificent job with this film. It made we wish that more Westerns were made, even if by &quot;furriners&quot; like Frears. Billy Crudup is a young actor whose career I will follow with interest: His restrained role of a man who cannot do what he most wants sticks in the memory. It was good also to see Katy Jurado of HIGH NOON fame in a small scene-stealing walk-on as a Mexican witch, or bruja, who tells fortunes.

I began reading this book expecting not much more than a decent, informative summer read. What I found was an always passionate, but not always on-target study of the Italian people by one of their own. While not all books on national character on worth reading, this one has merit.Instead of looking at THE ITALIANS as a cohesive book, which it is not, I suggest you take it as a series of chapters -- some brilliant and right on the mark, others overstating a simple truism. In the former category, we have the two brilliant chapters at the end on Italian history after the defeat at Fornovo in 1495, and how foreign intervention led to the development of the Baroque in art, music, and life. Less effective are the chapters on Italian family life and how to succeed in Italy without half trying.Barzini was dumbfounded at how the world was (and apparently still is) beating a path to Italy without understanding what every Italian knows. He asks, &quot;Why did Italy, a land notoriously teeming with vigorous, wide-awake and intelligent people always behave so feebly? Why was she invaded, ravaged, sacked, humiliated in every century, and yet failed to do the simple things necessary to defend herself?&quot;THE ITALIANS does not answer these questions; but the fact that it posits them and comes close to answering them makes it a remarkable failure. I believe this book has been more or less continuously in print for 36 years, and with good reason.Italy may seem at times like the animated, gaily-bedizened clown from the commedia dell'arte; but in reality, she is more like the tragic clown Pagliacci from Leoncavallo's opera, who, cruelly traduced, forces himself to laugh through his tears.

William Trevor is a wonderful writer; but I am now convinced that Atom Egoyan is an even greater filmmaker. When one compares the novel with the film, it is Trevor who suffers.Felicia is knocked up by a visiting Irish lad who lives around Birmingham. Without letting her family know that she has gone far beyond their interdictions of her relationship, she gathers up some money and jumps the ferry to England. Did I forget to tell you that he never bothered to give her his address? All she knows is that he works in the manufacture of power lawnmowers.Mr Hilditch, son of a deceased French female TV chef, has built his life on cooking his mother's recipes for himself and for the factory workers for whom he runs an inhouse cafeteria. He is fascinated by Felicia (as he was with other &quot;wayward&quot; girls in the past) and seems to stalk her with good advice and officious, somewhat suspect, help as she fails to find her beau.What prevents Mr Hilditch from drugging and killing the helpless Felicia, who has just had an abortion at his behest, is a sudden and unexpected confrontation with a West Indian woman street preacher who quite suddenly makes Mr Hilditch confront himself for the first time. His pattern of unexamined repetitive behavior is suddenly shattered. In the confusion, Felicia escapes; and the poor gourmet/killer has no recourse but to put an end to all his compulsions in the most decisive way possible.Given the subject matter, why are the scenes in Ireland suffused with a haunting Celtic sympathetic sadness? And why is Hilditch in love with his dead mother, and why does he spend all his time watching her videos and following her movement for movement as she concocts fabulous French dishes, which he eats alone? This is all Egoyan, not Trevor.With Egoyan, you read between the lines. The plot is there, but mind and spirit are always taking up new and strange forms. What a marvellous ride!

One of my favorite Monty Python sketches shows us a number of commentators broadcasting a cricket game. After one play, one of them sagely states, &quot;Very well not played.&quot; The others chime in saying &quot;EXTREMELY well not played.&quot;So it is with A. S. Byatt's BIOGRAPHER'S TALE. A young scholar named Phineas Nanson tires of endless deconstructionism and turns to writing a biography of a biographer, the redoubtable Scholes Destry-Scholes, noted for his study of the equally redoubtable Elmer Bole. Destry-Scholes, however, has covered his tracks well -- leaving behind no pictures, only some fragmentary writings on Linnaeus, Francis Galton, and Henrik Ibsen. Oh, and also a radiologist niece named Vera Alphage, whom Nanson beds. He also runs into Fulla Bliefeld, a Scandinavian scientist specializing in bees, who also finds a warm place in Nanson's heart.Well, what do we have here? Let's see: Several fragments and two budding relationships. And the biography? Abandoned. Miss Byatt has aroused expectations which she has not fulfilled. Nanson's research is actually fascinating; and, until the very end, I wondered where Byatt was taking us. It seems the answer is, down a garden path.If the rest of the book weren't so fascinating, I would be outraged. As it is, I'm still perpelexed by my first introduction to this writer, though I am interested enough to pursue some researches on my own into Linnaeus, Galton, Ibsen, and a certain whirlpool off the coast of Norway known as the Maelstrom. Consequently, I do not feel myself to have been completely traduced.

One of my favorite Monty Python sketches involves two radio commentators broadcasting a cricket game. After one play, one of them states, "Very well not played." His partner chimes in, "Extremely well not played."So it is with A.S. Byatt's THE BIOGRAPHER'S TALE. A young scholar named Phineas G. Nanson tires of endless deconstructionism of literary works and is talked into writing a biography of Scholes Destry-Scholes, noted for his study of the redoubtable Elmer Bole. Nanson is tired of words: He wants things in his life. Destry-Scholes, however, turns out to be an elusive subject. He has left behind no portraits, only a few biographical fragments about Linnaeus, Francis Galton, and Hendrik Ibsen -- oh, and also a radiologist niece named Vera Alphage, whom Nanson beds. Enroute, he meets two gay adventure travel consultants, who hire him, and a voluptuous Swedish bee specialist named Fulla Bliefeld, who seduces him.So what do we have here? One researcher. Two budding relationships. But no biography. I followed Byatt with great fascination down what appears to have been a garden path.Normally, I would be outraged: I've been toyed with, but not actually traduced. For me, one measure of a book's success is where it leads me. Destry-Scholes' fragments have made me itch to read more about Linnaeus, Galton, and Ibsen. Aptly, the final image I have in my mind is the toilet-flushing image of the Maelstrom, the giant whirlpool off the coast of Norway where Destry-Scholes apparently lost his life.

&quot;Come grow old with me / The best is yet to be...&quot;Browning's lines from &quot;Rabbi Ben Ezra&quot; apply nicely to O'Brian's great Aubrey/Maturin series (although I understand that the last couple of volumes in the series are not quite up to the standard). Partly because so few writers can create vital and interesting characters any more, O'Brian stands out with his correct Tory Naval captain (Jack Aubrey) and his British intelligence agent/scientist friend (Stephen Maturin), who show here that they can age gracefully.But don't begin here. You have to have read the series in order to understand their tangled love and financial relationships and how the situation in THE COMMODORE came to be. If you have read the others through THE WINE DARK SEA, you are in for a real treat.Aubrey and Maturin combat pro-Napoleonic forces at home and abroad. In the process, they deliver crippling blows to the West African slave trade and prevent a French landing in support of Irish independence.Now that he has risen in the ranks, Aubrey must deal with issues raised by an incompetent spit-and-polish commander like Captain Thomas and by an otherwise talented sodomite in the person of Captain Duff whose officers rebel against favoritism shown to his catamites. Throughout the book, our heroes are uncertain of the welcome they will receive from their wives and families -- yet they are driven onward for King and Country.

If a certain city is one of your favorite places, it presumably means that you feel something about it that -- if you are a writer -- you wish to convey to others. That passion is missing from this book, which is an oddly muted tribute to a city I've always wished to visit. In addition, Jan Morris claims this will be her last book. Why should a good writer like her want to go out with such a whimper?TRIESTE AND THE MEANING OF NOWHERE is, to be sure, a competently written work. All the major themes are present, but the guts just aren't there. What about Sir Richard F. Burton squirming through his last years far from the scenes of his triumphs? What about James Joyce creating great literature while trying to earn beer money teaching? Then there is the withering irony of Hungary's leader Admiral Horthy, at a time when his country had had no port for decades, yielding his country to the Nazis out of craven fear. There is material here for a book that yet remains to be written.Trieste still sits there at the head of the Adriatic waiting for THE book to be written about it. Until such time, this is an adequate book, well written, but even below the author's standard.

Please accept my title in the Pickwickian sense: I love Pratchett and consider him to be the replacement in my life for the loss of Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and Douglas Adams. Why aren't Americans ever that funny?Please forgive me, however, for being just a little heretical. I liked the characters of Rincewind and Twoflowers, was intrigued by The Luggage (I want one!), and loved Cohen the Barbarian. I DID miss the richness of the characters in the later Ankh-Morpork Pratchetts: characters such as Corporal Carrot, DEATH (I'm really not shouting), Angua, Susan Sto Helit, Commander Vimes, and The Patrician. Rincewind and Twoflower were both -- dare I say it? -- schmoes at the beginning of the book and and at the end.I think that Pratchett has a real affinity for Ankh-Morpork, and the farther he strays from it, the less vital his stories appear. (I except SMALL GODS, which is a real tour de force.) So, bring on the Pratchetts, and let's have more of the Night Watch and Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, more trolls and golems, and lots more of that beauty spot on (or, actually, near) the Circle Sea -- Ankh-Morpork.

I don't think I'd like to have Charles Dickens as my travelling companion. He's always on the go, seemingly preferring an enclosed carriage careening down the road to mixing it with the natives (he makes one exception for Genoa, where he spends twelve months). And he makes virtually no mention of his wife, to whom refers at one point as accompanying him, but who therupon disappears as surely as if she had fallen down a well. Finally, as a Roman Catholic, I would spend my trip grimacing at his observations of my faith.The people appearing in PICTURES are almost entirely people encountered enroute, including postilions, innkeepers, guides, soldiers, and the like. He does not appear to have entertained any intention of interviewing writers, political leaders, prelates, or others. It is as if I took a trip through the U.S. and wrote only about bus drivers, service station attendants, traffic cops, and ticket takers.And yet, and yet, it is obviously the great Charles Dickens writing this book. The writing is superb even if the subject matter is strangely limited. I was entertained, dismayed, and befuddled all at the same time. Comparing it to something like Mark Twain's INNOCENTS ABROAD or ROUGHING IT, however, I feel it is Twain who comes out ahead. Dickens, it seems, forgot to create any memorable characters.

The more I read of Joyce Carol Oates, the more I get drawn in by her tales of women on the edge.We have all seen women like Kathleen Hennessy. When you look at them with the eyes half-closed, they are almost fetching if you are feeling somewhat peckish; but alpha males just continue scanning for more promising material. (If the preceding sentence strikes you as callous, you may be wound up too tight to read this book.)That Oates can take seemingly unpromising material like Kathleen Hennessy and, while being true to her subject, manages to show that, for many, life on earth hasn't risen far enough. The daughter of an abusive father and a runaway mother, Kathleen finds herself in a series of foster homes in the Detroit area, growing up hoping to become a nurse but ending up as a nurse's aide. She manages to attract a young physician named Orson Abbott, but the relationship progresses no further than her pregnancy.Without giving away the ending, I can only say that Kathleen's solution to her problem is simple, methodical, and great material for a supermarket tabloid spread. In fact, certain events occur almost in passing that would make for a great cover story in the NATIONAL ENQUIRER.Oates is second only to Anton Chekhov in her ability to take a seemingly uncomplicated person and show us depths we had never before imagined. Why, I wonder, is she not given the honor she deserves? I think many readers take her for granted because she is so prolific and writes mostly about women. Duh, so did Jane Austen!

Tourists all too often waltz in and out of some of the most spectacular places on earth altogether unprepared for what they see. Everyone knows that the Loire Valley of France has hundreds of striking chateaux, but few know that for over 100 years, the kings of France preferred to live along the Loire rather than exposing themselves to the (then) noisome stinks of Paris and its rabble.Philippe Barbour's excellent guide gives you the background to travel intelligently. You, too, will know how Charles VIII, Conqueror of Milan, died (by bumping his head on a low door at the Chateau of Amboise); how it happens that the Chateau of Cheverny still sports its original furnishings (the same family has dwelt there since before the Revolution); and how Marie de Medicis disposed of her dead husband's mistress Diane de Poitiers (she exiled her to the Cheateau de Chaumont -- I can imagine a worse fate). You will learn that the Loire was not only the home of the French kings, but also the literary giants Rabelais and Balzac, both of whom wrote prolifically about the valley of their birth.At the same time, Barbour's book is a highly acceptable guidebook for accommodations and restaurants -- if you remember that the book was published in 1997. Cadogan does not redo its guides every year, so they tend to emphasize background information that supplements other, more up-to-date guides like those produced by Rick Steves or Frommer.If you don't want to travel uninformed, this is perhaps your best bet for obtaining the background you need painlessly.

Having read Vidal's BURR, I could hardly wait to tackle the next volume in his American Chronicle series: LINCOLN. The only disappointment came in that, from the very start, I could see the assassination scene at Ford's Theater. There was no changing the fact that all roads ultimately led to that bullet in the head; and when it happened, there was nothing more to do than quickly wrap up the loose ends and that was it!Such is the problem of most biographical novels, that they end in the death of their subject.Vidal deflected the problem in BURR by having the main character the fictional Charlie Schuyler (who makes a cameo appearance in LINCOLN's last chapter). Although in LINCOLN, the author used multiple points of view, not any one of these point of view characters could carry the story by himself: John Hay, Secretary of State Seward, Secretary of the Treasury Chase, and Southern sympathizer David Herrold. The last of these is the weakest. Vidal fails to provide anyone who can give a good reason to stand up for the Confederacy (such as in that great scene in the movie GETTYSBURG where Col. Joshua Chamberlain's brother talks to the three rebel prisoners and why they fought). I guess it shows that Vidal is too much of a Yankee.In the end, LINCOLN ends with the president's secretary, John Hay, in France. Perhaps more of the narrative burden should have been borne by Hay. He was certainly interesting and articulate enough, where Chase and Seward come across as eccentric and old-womanish with exaggerated opinions of themselves; and David Herold comes across as a wannabe punk.The glory of LINCOLN is in its characterization of the President himself. Lincoln always surprises his enemies and always knows more than he lets on. Before long we learn of Mary Todd Lincoln's growing mental illness and marvel at Lincoln's gentle yet effective protection of his family from the scandals that threaten to engulf it.All in all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Lincoln's presidency. (The book starts with his arrival in Washington to begin his first term.) Except for the construction problems noted above, I found the book to be an admirable character study by a writer who obviously loved his subject.

I don't normally read books that are ghostwritten. This one, however, was not only informative but wildly entertaining. See Judge Judy skewer self-proclaimed victims, lazy attorneys, callous bureaucrats, unwed teen mothers, craven foster parents, and in general anyone who while serving themselves degrades the lives we all lead in this land of ours.The only negative I can think of is that, too often, points that need more detail end up as truncated sound bites. By making her points as succinctly as possible, Judge Judy has justifiably won for herself quite a following -- although the book's trenchant style is not dissimilar to her TV appearances, so I can't blame the ghost writer. I guess I'm just too much of a detail wonk to feel comfortable with short shrift on major subjects. Give me facts, footnotes, and all those other scholarly trappings that take me beyond the level of the merely anecdotal.But this book is not meant for people like me, though I can enjoy it as much as anyone. Judge Judy's elevation of COMMON SENSE to a principle of jurisprudence is guaranteed to make you think, even if it doesn't satisfy all bases.

Being a desolate and arid land, Patagonia is a treasure trove of paleontological sites. This book tells the story of several consecutive expeditions to one of these locations, an area near Nequ&eacute;n which they have christened Auca Mahuevo, where a huge discovery of thousands of dinosaur eggs and several nearly intact skeletons were discovered.The authors -- Luis M. Chiappe and Lowell Dingus -- describe chronologically the process of discovery, preparation of the fossils for analysis, establishing the time and cause of death, and implied conclusions about the behavior of the species they represented.Mind you, paleontology can be dreadfully dull. Following the classification systems requires rote memorization and careful attention to barely discernible features on sometimes badly worn bones and embryos. Interesting details are provided on the interactions between the paleontologists, geologists, and locals -- as well as the bad weather conditions they frequently endured. Fortunately, they managed to keep my interest up -- but just barely. Some of the chapters, such as the one on magnetic dating, were hard for a non-scientist such as myself to follow.Probably the strangest image to emerge in my mind from reading this book is that of oviraptoids, large feathered parrot-headed dinosaurs. Can you imagine what one of those could to to the windshield of your car?

We Americans don't really stray far from Western Europe in our knowledge of history. But from its very beginnings, Islam presented a clear and palpable threat to the West. Spain had already succumbed, and France was threatened by the Moors. Most shocking, the Holy Land was occupied by Turks. (Think of the response if we were to occupy Mecca and Medina!)Europe responded by the Crusades, about which we know a little, and with the military monastic orders such as the Knights Templar and Knights of St John Hospitaller, about whom we know next to nothing. These were men who lived a monastic (or at least semi-monastic) life and who acted as Christendom's shock troops in the war against the Saracen.The Crusader kingdoms of the Middle East finally fell after 300 years of constant strife, but the idea caught on in Spain in the drive to expel the Moors and in Prussia against the surrounding Northern Slav Pagans.Perhaps the most stirring tale Seward tells is of the strife between the Knights of St John, having been expelled by the Turks from Rhodes, recovering brilliantly in the siege of Malta in 1565. After demolishing a force of 30,000 with only 6,000 men, the Knights ever after became known as the Knights of Malta.Other reviewers have complained that this is a difficult book. It has to be: Almost a thousand years are covered, not to mention a score of countries. Think of it as a very dense appetizer to lead you further into what is surely one of the most exciting epochs of our history.

In most coffee table books about wildlife, the text serves a minor role compared to the photographs. Reading this book, I was delighted to find that Jasmine Rossi, a talented amateur with no previous books to her credit, actually wrote a fascinating set of portraits of the birds and mammals of the Valdes Peninsula and Punta del Tombo in the State of Chubut, Argentina.As this area is now one of the major eco-tourist destinations in all of Latin America, this book was badly needed. Graham Harris's A GUIDE TO THE BIRDS AND MAMMALS OF COASTAL PATAGONIA is hard to find and is considerably more dry.Although she skimps a bit on the bird life, Rossi wrote a wonderful chapter on the Magellanic Penguins which obviously owed a lot to close observation. Particularly affecting was the story of a penguin couple whom she names Jos&eacute; and Maria who hatch two eggs. The chick born first grows more quickly and has better access to food, forcing his younger and smaller sibling to attempt to steal food from an adjoining couple, at which point the interloper is pecked to death by the offended mother.Other particularly detailed chapters deal with the whales, sea lions, elephant seals, and orcas that make the peninsula their home. Also of interest is the last chapter, in which the author describes her experiences in the writing of this book.This book provides not only a superb set of photographs of Patagonian wildlife, but vignettes on their behavior, breeding habits, enemies, and the toll, if any, that human tourism takes on the species.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in the subject.

What is it like to be truly alive, from the ground of one's being to the tips of one's fingers? Of all the great writers, only G K Chesterton can address this subject without appearing static and banal. At one point, one of his characters writes that "men flee from the embrace of a great optimist as from the embrace of a bear. Nothing brings down more curses than a real benediction."Over his lifetime, GKC has been the great optimist -- a great shambling bear who is at the same time a bringer of benedictions. His entire work is the most optimistic oeuvre ever penned. Whenever the shadows of the post-September 11 world weigh me down, I pick a book, any book, from the four shelves of Chesterton in my collection and surrender myself to hope, whimsy, and the promise of a better world.MANALIVE is a novel in two movements. In the first, we are introduced to Innocent Smith, who alarmingly drops into the story from the sky as it were. His words and actions are so radical as to cause a conspiracy to be formed (mostly by two psychologists who are present) to have him placed in an institution.Chesterton suddenly introduces one of his pet ideas. Why not have Smith's innocence (sic) judged by the residents of Beacon House, where the action takes place? Given a choice between large and small institutions, GKC always opts for the latter. One of the characters, Michael Moon, asserts:"Come, we are a company of free, white, Christian people, such as might be besieged in a town or cast up on a desert island. Let us do this thing ourselves. Let us go into that house there and sit down and find out with our own eyes and ears whether this thing is true or not; whether this Smith is a man or a monster. If we can't do a little thing like that, what right have we to put crosses on ballot papers?"In the second part, everything that seemed bizarre or immoral in Smith's behavior turns out to be the result of a series of misconceptions (a similar theme recurs in GKC's FOUR FAULTLESS FELONS). Far from being the quintessence of turpitude, Innocent Smith is shown by the evidence to be not only NOT guilty, but a very model of human behavior.Perhaps the world of Chesterton's novels can be faulted for a lack of realism, but only if you think that realism implies grimness. This is a world where ideas exist vividly as personifications, and there is not a single distraction from the purity of that idea. If it is allegorical, it is a most robust and muscular allegory replete with banners flying and bands playing. And we are all invited to the party.

Every once in a while, some terrible act results in good. For example, the same Spanish bishop -- Diego de Landa -- who burned the irreplaceable writings of the Mayans wrote a book which was critical in subsequent scholars' understanding of Mayan culture. So also the inquisition established in southwest France in the early years of the 14th century to root out the last vestiges of the Cathar heresy resulted, ultimately, in this little treasure of a book.The Albigensian Crusade had dealt a death-blow to Catharism, but rural pockets of the heresy persisted. The ambitious bishop of Pamiers, Jacques Fournier, brought in all the residents of one village for questioning. Consisting mostly of shepherds and peasants, Montaillou was a hotbed of Catharism, including the parish priest! Everyone was questioned in detail about their religious practices, households, relationships, work, and travel. Their testimony was taken down verbatim by a clerk; and, after the trial, the records lay untouched in the library of the Vatican until Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie wrote this book.This is not the usual study of wealthy, educated, and influential Medieval people. Here we have the voice of Everyman. In addition to a great deal of detail about the practices of the Cathar "goodmen," with their sacraments of heretication, the "consolamentum," and the awful "endura," we see how average people formed households, managed to eke out a living, what they talked about, how they got along with their neighbors, how faithful they were to their wives -- in effect, everything.Because Le Roy Ladurie is a scholarly historian, there are hundreds of footnotes pointing to records of this particular inquisatorial proceeding. They do not manage, however, to cover up the voices of the people of Montaillou, as they tried to explain to their inquisitors the details of their everyday lives.It took me a little while to realize the uniqueness of this book as I read it. Then it came clear to me that these were the voices of the little people who are almost never heard in history.

In May 2000 I stood hat in hand at Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris paying my respects to a giant named Honore de Balzac. His masterpiece, PERE GORIOT, has resonated across over 30 years since that happy moment in 1968 when I first sat down to dine at Mme de Vauquer's boarding house, since I first heard the whispered confidences of Mme de Nucingen and the sighs of the Duchesse de Langeais, and since I first ran into that master criminal Vautrin.Balzac was at the same time an extraordinarily ambitious man and one who knew the limits of fame and fortune. For years he chased his Polish countess, and no sooner did he win and marry her than he fell ill and died. I would like to think that there was a smirk on his face as he saw the irony: He was himself a character in a Balzac novel, a composite of all his characters -- whether of the court or the hovel, from bankers to ragpickers, high and low.On the surface, this is a modern day version of Lear: An old man gives everything to his ambitious daughters and dies. The focus of the story, however, is no more on Papa Goriot and his daughters than on all the other characters in the story: the ambitious Rastignac, the plotting Vautrin, the good Dr. Bianchon, the clueless Victorine, the struggling Delphine de Nucingen -- all are caught in a web. (As was Balzac.)This book changed the way I see the world. It can do no less for you. It is as if, suddenly, the mist that hides the motives of men parts, and we see the world of men as it really is, with all the marionette strings tangled up as each puppet strives to claw its way toward the top.

At 25,000 feet, you are only a fraction of yourself. Starved of oxygen, brain cells begin to die; and you struggle to perform the most simple tasks. Irrespective how strong your resolve, you are at the mercy of the mountain. Experienced professional climbers and sherpas both will suddenly lose bodily function and begin to die -- or not. They can just as easily "conquer" the peak and win glory. In either case, it's staking your life on a roll of the dice.In the climbing season of 1996, a large number of climbing parties that included numerous non-professionals attempted Everest, and a dozen of them were left in crevasses, under avalanches, or under crude cairns put up by later expeditions. For several years, these expeditions were a source of controversy, fueled by a book attacking Krakauer and by a famous New Yorker article. People, being people, always want someone to blame.I had heard of INTO THIN AIR long before I read it and knew of the controversies. Nothing prepared me, however, for Krakauer's vivid recounting of the events of 1996. Although it gets confusing cutting back and forth between 16 expeditions on the mountain, the central fact of the difficulties faced by the climbers and by the apparently random fates that befell them comes across clearly.At one point, Krakauer quotes Conrad's LORD JIM:"There are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales, and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intention -- that indefinable something that forces it upon the mind and heart of a man, that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice, with a strength beyond control, with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and fear, the pain of his fatigue and the longing for rest: which means to smash, to destroy, to annihilate all...."So when I read all the morning-after pundits attempt to recast the events so that one person or another is to blame, all I can conclude is that anyone who attempts Everest has placed his life in pawn -- regardless how experienced he or she is, how strong, how well equipped, how otherwise lucky. Time and chance happen to all, and on the mountain, they happen with a vengeance.This is superlative reading, and I recommend it to all without qualification.

Take one of the most fascinating topics in Renaissance history and give it to the most inexperienced History Channel screenwriter -- you know: the ones who don't have too much to say, and consequently repeat every thin fact endlessly -- and you have this book. After having read it, I know no more than if I had read the Encyclopedia Britannica entry for Giordano Bruno. I was not only uninformed but bored as well. The only reason I finished the book at all is that I couldn't believe that the author went so far with so little data.Firstly, I would like to know more about Giordano Bruno's contribution to Renaissance thought. Although some Italian sources were referenced in the notes and bibliography, I am not convinced that White actually tackled them himself. Secondly, I would not have minded some more apropos quotes from Bruno himself -- even if it meant padding the book a bit -- anything but the endless repetition of a few basic biographical facts.It appears that Michael White has written other books on the general subject of scientific history, books that garnered some decent reviews. I sincerely hope that this was just an odd lapsus menti and not the sign of a fourth-rate biographer.

My trusty HP DeskJet 712C has chugged along for three years using HP cartridges. When I switched to a competing brand for the Black cartridge, I saw a sudden drop in quality -- especially in the first few days of use.I appreciate the fact that, unlike some manufacturers, HP separates the Black from the Color cartridge. Rarely, if ever, do they both run out at the same time.Be sure to note the expiration date on the back. One batch that I purchased at a suspiciously good price had expired over a year before and just wouldn't print at all.

In its last days, the Roman Republic was a wild and wooly place. Popular thugs like Lucius Sergius Catilina (Catiline) and Publius Clodius Pulcher saw in the shifting vacuums of power an opportunity to flout the law and win power and riches at the expense of their fellow countrymen. Standing squarely in their path was a Roman Senator, Marcus Tullius Cicero, who knew how to win men's minds with his powerful speeches and who had a fanatical dedication to maintaining the rule of law in the face of anarchy.The art that Cicero practiced is not held in great repute today: We tend to distrust a man who can marshal cogent arguments and dazzling rhetoric in support of a cause. Consider, however, how remarkable it is that so many of Cicero's orations, letters, and other writings have survived today. Not only were his speeches eagerly read by his contemporaries, but early Christian monks saw in the great orator a basically moral, even if Pagan, writer whose work was worth saving in the scriptorium.Among his own speeches, Cicero most highly rated his four blistering attacks on Catilina. My own personal favorite is "In Defence of Titus Annius Milo." In it, the wily orator shows he had a strong streak of Johnny Cochrane. The Tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher had been one of Cicero's most determined enemies and at one time had him banished for his advocacy of executing the leaders of Catiline's conspiracy. When Clodius is killed attempting to bushwhack a rival, Cicero jumped to defend the accused murderer.In a letter, Cicero had bragged, "Let me tell you that it was I who produced the necessary darkness in the court to prevent your guilt from being visible to everyone." Where Cicero claims that Titus Annius Milo was attended at the time of the ambush with an "unwarlike retinue of maids and pages," he was actually accompanied by a large party of gladiators who were more than able to thwart the attack. While claiming that Milo had never threatened Clodius, Cicero wrote a letter to his lifelong correspondent Atticus stating the opposite, that Milo had openly threatened to kill Clodius.Even when pulling the wool over his listeners' eyes, Cicero's political speeches in this volume provide a fascinating picture of a time and place which would otherwise be largely unknown to us.

I was drawn to read this book by falling in love with a portrait of the author. She had a serenely pleasant face that radiated calm and good sense, and suddenly I wanted to know more about her. When I discovered that her diaries and letters cut a broad swath from 1778 to 1838, I was hooked.Here is a woman who was an intimate of Dr Johnson, James Boswell, Joshua Reynolds, the Thrales, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the Bluestockings, George III and Queen Charlotte -- to name just a few. She was the first woman novelist who did not die in penury (like Aphra Behn and Charlotte Lennox): Her EVELINA, CECILIA, CAMILLA, and THE WANDERER are still readily available after more than 200 years. For five years, Miss Burney served as wardrobe maid for Queen Charlotte until illness forced her to resign. Her descriptions of the court of George III show the monarch at the beginnings of the madness that later debilitated him and contain some of her best prose.By then, the French Revolution was in full swing, and scores of French nobility made their way to safety in England. When she met General d'Arblay, adjutant to the exiled Marquis de Lafayette, it was love at first sight for this 40-year-old woman who had never been married. Despite the opposition of her father, Fanny married d'Arblay and lived happily with him until his death more than 20 years later. Sadly, she also outlived her son from this marriage.Fanny followed her husband to France during the Consulate and met the rising young Napoleon, Talleyrand, Louis XVIII (during Napoleon's exile at Elba), and other notables. She succeeded in raising a family near Paris despite the fact that, for a good part of that time, France was at war with England. At Waterloo, she helped by helping to create bandages for the wounded.This is a book to read slowly and savor the feeling of another time. Fanny outlived the 18th Century "Age of Reason" and saw the birth of Romanticism and the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria. I would like to have known her. Reading her diaries, I feel I do; and I feel even more drawn to her than before.

Honore de Balzac spent a good part of his life eluding his creditors. His house on the Rue Raynouard in Paris (which I visited in 1997) was designed to help screen out creditors and, when that failed, to allow the author to slip out the back entrance on Rue Bertin and make his getaway.One result of Balzac's perennial impecuniousness is the controlling role of money in his books. Even in this novel, ostensibly a study of politics within a French ministry during the reign of Charles X, the strings are pulled by two fascinatingly grim money-lenders named Gobseck and Gigonnet.The obvious choice for the ministry, a brilliant and dedicated politico named Rabourdin, is painted into a corner and sees his career destroyed by a legion of lesser men who conspire against him. Perhaps the most telling criticism that could be made of this otherwise excellent novel is that that Balzac spends the first 75% of THE BUREAUCRATS introducing approximately a hundred characters, their wives and relations.While it is difficult at times to keep track without a scorecard, Balzac's main theme of overextended goodness destroyed by well-connected, mealy-mouthed nothings runs like a river in flood through the pages of THE BUREAUCRATS.The book is worth reading if only for the magnificent irony of the ending, which I will not tell for fear of ruining the surprise. Hang in there for the finish, and don't get sidetracked by all the characters.

I had not read much of Frost since I saw him give a reading at Dartmouth College in the last year of his life. This September, I went back to New Hampshire for the first time in 39 years, visiting my old campus -- and Robert Frost's farm near Franconia Notch. In my bag was Louis Untermeyer's delightful selection of Frost poems, interspersed by his lucid, but unobtrusive commentary.Frost is a poet who has a very distinctive "voice" in his works. It takes a bit of ferreting out to see how it changes from one poem to another, sometimes substantially, from wry and folksy all the way to devastatingly ironic. To help us with the process, Untermeyer groups several like poems together between blocks of commentary. Each group acted as a separate unit to assist in breaking the text into readable chunks.Especially with a book of poetry, that is no mean feat. It helped that Untermeyer knew Frost as well as any man alive. The selection is superb, including my favorites: "After Apple-Picking," "The Sound of the Trees," "The Death of the Hired Man," and "Mending Wall."For the price, there is no better collection. It is Untermeyer's special gift to make it more fun to read.

Here I am sitting on a chair and pecking at a keyboard with a monitor and computer in front of me. At least I think so. But what if the sushi I had for lunch was spiked with a psychotropic drug that makes me believe that this typing at the keyboard activity is real? Especially when, in actual reality, I may be strung up stark naked and upside-down in a subterranean dungeon with rats gnawing at my vitals while happily thinking up what to write about Stanislaw Lem's greatest book, THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS.The reason why I believe that some of the best sci-fi since WW2 came from Eastern Europe (Lem from Poland and Boris and Arkady Strugatsky from Russia) is that the mind set of communism was conducive toward what is referred to as &quot;aesopic writing&quot; (The term comes from Solzhenitsyn.) If you protested anything, you were regarded as a traitor to the state; but if you wrote fables as the Greek writer Aesop did which were not set in a particular unnamed repressive regime at a particular time, you might be able to get away with it scot free.Lem had a field day by speculating on a congress who members are drugged into thinking they are drugged into acting as if they were drugged ... it goes on and on. The more or less classical beginning descends into multiple levels of questioning every level into reality, until even the most utterly solipsistic stance is questioned. By that time, you are either confused or, if you're like me, laughing your head off. As they say in another context, unreal!

THE COMING ANARCHY is a cold shower for those of us who once entertained illusions about the future of those desperately poor countries usually referred to as the Third World. I remembered the glowing articles about Liberia (founded by American slaves); South Africa (loved that Reconciliation Commission); and Tito's Yugoslavia (they actually stood up to Stalin) that I read in years past. Each nurtured a hope that there was, in my lifetime, a way out for the world's oppressed.There are, in fact, several ways out -- and none of them bode well for us wealthy democracies. The Malthusian pressures, according to Kaplan, will make the pot boil over with disease, unrest, mass migration, and terrorism. Why NOT become an exploding martyr when there is no reason to continue living? Why NOT contract smallpox and hop a jet to the States? Anything but stay on in a filthy gutter outside a shack cobbled together with garbage!Kaplan doesn't have any answers. Washington doesn't have any answers. The U.N. has answers, but at a price tag that will put all of us on an economic par with Burkina Faso. And, of course, I don't have any answers; but I will continue to hope, because that is my nature.I understand that Kaplan is becoming required reading in Washington. We must be careful, with all our power, not to become like Thucydides' Athenians: a great power who, in facing down the enemy, became perhaps worse than the enemy.At the same time, it is a valuable corrective to read Kaplan. In addition to the essay &quot;The Coming Anarchy,&quot; I would particularly recommend the essays on Metternich and Kissinger, Gibbon's DECLINE AND FALL, and Joseph Conrad's NOSTROMO.It all looked so rosy when the Berlin Wall fell. Now it's time to face the issues we ignored while engaged in our half-century folie de deux with Communism.

What possessed George Gissing -- best known for his hardscrabble pictures of poverty in London, such as NEW GRUB STREET -- to travel to Southern Italy and write a classical travel book about his journey? Yet there he is, working his way along the underside of the boot of Italy as a traveller. Even then, the area was known primarily for its rural poverty and has not attracted tourism at any time in its existence since the Greeks settled there over 2,000 years ago.And yet this is perhaps Gissing's most charming book. He becomes ill, is taken care of by strangers, does his best to escape the clutches of the local bands of outlaws, and succeeds in his quest to see a corner of Europe known to few outside of Italy.I highly recommend this book as the best introduction to a writer who deserves a revaluation of his literary reputation.

How many men and women who have lived more than 2,000 years ago have impressed us with their humanity? We tend to see the statuary, but rarely the person behind it. When you read this outstanding selection edited by the excellent classical historian Michael Grant, you see that Marcus Tullius Cicero has a human face -- and it shows in his work.The Roman Republic that Cicero loved was falling apart. Marius and Sulla, the Gracchi, the conflicts over the powers of the tribunes had dealt a severe blow to a form of government that had proved itself adequate for governing a city-state, but less so for managing a multi-cultural empire. Cicero fought valiantly against corrupt governors like Verres (&quot;Against Verres&quot;) and would-be dictators like Marc Antony (&quot;2nd Phillipic Against Antony&quot;). When he finally threw in his lot with Pompey, he picked the wrong horse and put himself in harm's way. Eventually, Augustus and Antony had him killed as an obstacle to their plans.The wonderful letters that Cicero wrote to his friend Atticus and others such as Pompey show his hurt at having been rudely pushed aside. He saw himself as the Savior of Rome for his part in quashing the conspiracy of Catiline, but he lived in a world where &quot;What have you done for me lately?&quot; was the question of the day.Increasingly, Cicero turned to farming and philosophizing. His essays &quot;On Duty&quot; and &quot;On Old Age,&quot; reprinted here, are penetrating, humane, and even Christian in a way. One could see why monk copyists of the Middle Ages saw in the Roman senator a pre-Christian piety at work.Michael Grant supplies an excellent introduction, maps, genealogical charts, timelines, and even a glossary to guide the reader through Cicero's work. This book is definitely a keeper.

Having read Alain de Botton's highly amusing Proust book, I expected no less from CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY; and I was not disappointed. Five philosophers (Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche) and one giant of literature (Montaigne) are enlisted to help us deal with such universal problems as popularity, sexual rejection, poverty, and inadequacy.Curiously, none of these philosophers (with the possible exception of Epicurus) led happy lives. Seneca was ordered by his pupil Nero to commit suicide; Montaigne was tortured to the point of distraction by kidney stones; and Nietzsche went mad. De Botton, however, shows how each one exhibited great common sense on at least one area in their lives.The upshot of all this advice is to consider that others have it worse, buck up, and forge ahead despite all the obstacles. Not quite what Buddha discovered beneath the Bodhi Tree, but in this era of chicken soup for whatever ails you, it's a step up. Unlike most self-help books, this one instead of bloating two paragraphs into a 100,000-word book, leaves you hungry for more. Particularly useful are the notes in back, directing the reader to the sources and presumably further enlightenment.I was a little put out that de Botton left out all mention of Boethius, whose CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY was one of the most influential books of the last 1,500 years and is still a very worthy book for accomplishing the same goals. As a skeptic, I was also disappointed that Lucian of Samosata was omitted. Oh, well, you can't criticise a book for what it was not. De Botton's selection is highly individual and, what is more, it works.

This is one of those books that rips the blinkers from your eyes. Eric Schlosser goes well beyond the mere truism that "it isn't good for you" and looks at how the whole fast food industry has changed the way we live, from farmers to urban development, from immigration to globalization, from obesity to mad cow disease, and from entrepreneurship to the most god-awful working conditions this side of Dickens's London.FAST FOOD NATION is not just about fast food: It is about the CULTURE of fast food, and how that could be ever so much more pervasive than the e-Coli and rat feces in your Quickie Burger. In its own way, it is every bit as much a landmark as Upton Sinclair's THE JUNGLE.The fact that Schlosser provides 70 pages of notes and a bibliography indicates that this is a serious book that invites contradiction. Only, I think I won't contradict it much: I will just continue to keep on walking right past those Golden Arches.Curiously, Schlosser concentrates his attacks on the burger chains, leaving pizzerias, coffee shops, and sandwich chains pretty much off the hook. There are cases to be made for health issues relating to Chinese food, sushi, and other popular foods -- but I guess we'll have to wait for another book.

This is one of the great shaggy dog stories of all time. But, as the author is Umberto Eco, it means that a whole lot of other things are going on as well. Baudolino is a barely literate Northern Italian peasant who somehow a close friend of Frederick I Barbarossa, the 12th Century Holy Roman Emperor. He feels grateful to his emperor, and strives to take his leadership to the next level, by an embassy to the lost Christian realm of Prester John. As a suitable gift to the mythical ruler, Baudolino takes an old drinking cup of his father's and calls it the Holy Grail.Frederick goes along with the whole scheme -- anything to escape those endless wars with the petty Northern Italian states -- and sets out to the East. History states that Frederick drowned while crossing a river enroute to the Third Crusade. Eco invents a classical locked-room mystery to account for the emperor's death, and late in the book provides a neat answer that also satisfies the historians.The whole story is told to a Byzantine official whom Baudolino saves. While they escape the ravages of the Fourth Crusade with its sacking of Constantinople, Baudolino spins an incredible tale encompassing much of the medieval bestiary and then some. On one hand, he is the most incredible liar who never lived: His kingdom of Prester John is located in one of those eternally disgruntled Muslim states of Central Asia in which, if there were ever any unicorns, they were long served as shish-kebabs.There is a story about Freud and a mythical patient who spins out a long story for the great psychologist. "That's very interesting," said Freud. When the patient admits that the whole story was bogus, the response was, "That's even more interesting!"Baudolino IS the Middle Ages personified, except for the minor detail that he is not much of a believer in this age of faith. Where the old maps say, "there be dragons here," Baudolino shows you the dragons. Perhaps, a more true statement is that Baudolino is the Medieval Imagination personified. Bogus or not, he created worlds within worlds that are endlessly enthralling. Be prepared for a wild ride in what must be one of the best books written in the last ten years.

Whenever I confront the Icelandic sagas, as I have the urge to do from time to time, I feel anew the onrush of a different reality.Did someone do you dirt? Then bushwhack him and and his family and put them all to the sword. There will be settlements to be paid based on your wealth and influence and that of your victim's friends and remaining family, and the desire of your neighbors to put a cap on a burgeoning intergenerational blood feud. Divorce? Tell your old man you've had it with him, march away, and lay claim to half of his estate. (This while women in mainland Europe barely had the right to breathe.)The LAXDAELA SAGA is one of the best of the sagas, ranking with THE BURNT NJAL SAGA as one of the greatest works to come from the Viking world -- and the greatest literary works of the 12th-14th centuries from anywhere. Its numerous cast of characters (I count 189 names in the book's helpful Glossary of Proper Names, about 40 of which begin with &quot;Thor&quot;) boggles the mind. Just remember, these were real people, and their names are enshrined in the history of Iceland by their descendents.It takes several generations of ambushes, conniving marriages and bloody divorces, and even the introduction of Christianity around A.D. 1000 before the main story gets under way, namely the story of Gudrun Osvifs-daughter and her four marriages. This is no blushing romance: Look at Gudrun the wrong way, and start drafting your will! Her boyfriend Kjartan Olafsson dallies too long in Norway, and she marries his cousin Bolli out of spite. Then, when he returns, she does everything she can to urge Bolli to kill him and his men. A series of internecine feuds breaks out, and it takes more than twenty years for the bad blood to be drained off.Even minor characters suddenly come to life. Here is how Vigdis Ingjalds-daughter treats a man she regards as dishonorable: &quot;Vigdis went indoors to a chest that belonged to Thord [her husband] and there, at the bottom, she found a heavy purse. She took the purse and went out with it to Ingjald [no relation], and told him to take his money. Ingjald cheered up at this and held out his hand for it. Vigdis raised the purse and struck him on the nose with it, drawing blood; she accompanied this with a stream of derisive words, adding that he would never get the money back, and told him to clear off.&quot;Life was cheap in medieval Iceland. The anonymous author of this saga was, however, a great writer who identified closely with the people and events that went into the making of this sometimes barbaric, always awe-inspiring masterpiece.

"Voluptuaries, consumed by their senses, always begin by flinging themselves with a great display of frenzy into an abyss. But they survive, they come to the surface again. And they develop a routine of the abyss: 'It's four o clock. At five I have my abyss... '"This quote comes from one of those unclassifiable writers who flout all convention and blaze their own trail through life. I am referring to Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (1873-1954), better known simply as Colette. After completing the last of four of the Claudine novels, I'm trying to put words to an experience I have some difficulty describing.Colette is one of those writers who is so feminine and even feline that, as both a man and a person allergic to cats, I almost have to disqualify myself from the effort. But, being game, I'll give it a try.The first four novels Colette wrote were a fictionalization of her life in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye in the Burgundy region of France and in Paris. In COLETTE IN SCHOOL (1900), we see our heroine Claudine as a 15 year old in a provincial girls' school which is a hotbed of mischief and lesbianism. The headmistress is openly carrying on a relationship with one of her teachers at the school where they share a bedroom. Claudine is a rebellious teen who is a natural born leader and troublemaker. When her father decides to move to Paris, Claudine must go with him. In CLAUDINE IN PARIS (1901), we see Claudine getting used to the metropolis and finding love in her friend Marcel's father, Renaud. CLAUDINE MARRIED (1902) sees Claudine marrying Renaud. She falls under the sway of an Austrian woman named R&eacute;zi with whom she carries on a lesbian relationship with Renaud's amused approval. When she discovers that R&eacute;zi is serving both of them, Claudine leaves for her home town, called Montigny in the book. Finally, CLAUDINE AND ANNIE (1903) sees Claudine reunited with Renaud through the eyes of another young married woman, Annie, who is married to an absent, yet controlling, husband.These four novels are published together in one Penguin paperback called THE COMPLETE CLAUDINE, which is something of a misnomer, as there are other Claudine books, though none quite so famous as these four.Colette was a controversial and somewhat contradictory figure during her long life. She conducted both lesbian and heterosexual affairs and was married three times. Although she collaborated with the Vichy government during the war, she also helped Jews escape capture. She wrote over forty books and lived a very public life. In the end, she was honored by the Belgian Royal Academy, the Acad&eacute;mie Goncourt, and the Legion of Honor.She is probably best known to most Americans as the creator of GIGI, which went on to become an acclaimed American musical directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Leslie Caron.

There is a Jean-Luc Godard segment in one of those compilation films so popular in Europe during the 1960s. Imagine a high class brothel of the future -- located, as I recall, at an airport. The client requests an assignation and draws a prostitute who all but rapes him. He tries to open a conversation with her, but she is all action and no talk. The client protests to the management and draws another one who dresses in frills like a character from Jane Austen and recites romantic poetry. You've probably already guessed what happens: This one is all talk and no action.I yield to no one in my admiration of Balzac, whom I consider one of the greatest story-tellers of all time. It is very obvious that the character of Madame Blanche-Henriette de Mortsauf meant something special to the author in his life: Her piety and fine-tuned sensibility, however, don't come across well in our time. Women who suffer endlessly and fritter their lives away in sighs tend to give rise to a frustrated &quot;Oh, come off it already!&quot;The opposite of Mme de Mortsauf is the fascinating Arabelle, Marchionesse of Dudley, who conquers the narrator, Felix de Vandenesse, and keeps him in thrall with &quot;caresses never before enjoyed by any man.&quot; Alas, Balzac uses the multi-talented Arabelle primarily as a warning to all Frenchmen how cold-hearted the British are. We are tantalized but far from fulfilled.Call me a dirty old man, if you will, but I would rather that Balzac and Felix spent more time with Dudley and a whole lot less with Mme de Mortsauf. As it is, the latter dies horribly of her excessive sensibility, and Felix walks away from her grave resolved to live a life of which the angelic Mme de Mortsauf would have approved.We all know that Balzac made no such resolution in his own life. Despite his monkish pretensions, the author spent all his life pursuing women. When, after a multi-year courtship, he finally snared his Countess, he died within a year.It sounds as if I did not like LILY OF THE VALLEY. Far from it, I liked it a great deal; but do not see it as one of the author's more successful works. And yet, even at his worst, Balzac is better than most writers at their best, as when Felix muses &quot;I loved an angel and a demon, equally beautiful, one of them adorned with all the virtues which hatred of our imperfections induces us to hurt; the other with all the vices which our selfishness prompts us to deify.&quot; Read it and judge for yourself.

Typical of most Hollywood productions filmed under the watchful eyes of the censors during wartime, DESTINATION TOKYO is at the same time entertaining and naive. Some great films redolent with loss slipped through the censors' submarine net, most notably John Ford's THEY WERE EXPENDABLE and Raoul Walsh's OBJECTIVE BURMA. Delmer Daves' film is better than most, occasionally exciting, often dismayingly starry-eyed -- but it does work.At one point, a downed Japanese parachutist, about to be saved by the sub's crew, pulls out a dagger and fatally stabs his rescuer. We learn here that Japanese children are given a dagger at the age of 5, are taught to train militarily at the age of 7, and go to work in the armament factories at the age of 13. At least, that's what the propaganda people of our armed services wanted us to believe.On the other hand, Cary Grant turns in a remarkably gritty performance totally at odds with his romantic, devil-may-care persona. The cast is star-studded, but some little-known actors turn in outstanding performances -- most particularly the pharmacist's mate who has to perform an emergency appendectomy at the bottom of Tokyo Bay while a fellow crewman reads from a medical textbook. Also the relentless depth charge attack on the sub toward the end is beautifully sustained until our teeth are on edge.As I understand it, the sub is sent to Tokyo to take weather readings in preparation for the famous Doolittle raid. Whether or not this actually happened, and I doubt it did, it doesn't really matter.Today, of course, we are more likely to emphasize the pain and danger, and perhaps even kill off a few of the crew. Wolfgang Petersen's gruelling DAS BOOT is the new submarine paradigm.Given the time and conditions under which this film was made, Daves showed that he was a director with talent. Later, he went on to direct BROKEN ARROW and 3:10 TO YUMA and other excellent films. He is much underrated today and richly deserves a re-evaluation.

Most of us are in risk of being overwhelmed by our pursuit of "stuff." Let's just take babies as an example. It appears that strollers for toddlers must now cover almost half an acre and contain sufficient storage for any possible medical or hygienic emergency. Young married couples feel the necessity to immediately buy a huge van that is effective only at cutting off the view of the hapless motorists behind you. Houses must be larger to contain the "stuff" we buy for our children. Why? Because if we don't, it means we don't love them, I suppose.I must not have been loved very much. My father was a poor factory worker who drove a 1949 Mercury coup&eacute;. During all my childhood, I remember only a handful of toys: a set of white plastic blocks that were similar to the Legos that came later, various toy soldiers, a small Lionel O-Gauge electric train set, a stamp collection, a cowboy cap pistol, and a Civil War hat (Union Army type). That hat I wore with a blue cub scout shirt with captain's bars sown on that made me look like the boy Dusty on the old Rin Tin Tin show that I loved to watch.Over the years, I seem to have gone astray somewhat. My apartment has well over 6,000 books in it. However much I resolve to cut down, I always find myself intrigued by another title that I must read. If I were to sit down and read all the books I own, I would have to live for hundreds of years more.This slim volume was one of my recent purchases. I sat down to read it almost at once and fell in love with it. JOURNEYS OF SIMPLICITY is a book of lists of stuff with which selected real and fictional people traveled through their lives.Some of the lists, such as the personal effects of Thomas Merton when he was found dead in a Bangkok hotel room after being electrocuted by his room fan, were heart-wrenching. In almost every case, they set off a little flash bulb of enlightenment. Each list was a window into a person's life (even if that "person" were Bilbo Baggins or Dostoyevsky's Father Zossima from THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV).If ever I became a truly enlightened person? What would be on my list. Let me guess: a box of loose black Indian tea, a pot to boil water, a few (far less than 6,000) good books, a sweater, a jacket, two or three changes of clothing including wool socks, stout walking shoes, reading glasses, a hat -- and that's about it.Oh yes, and one other thing -- a sense of wonder.

It is after the events told in the HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy. Lyra Belacqua (now Lyra Silvertongue) is back in the Oxford of her world -- the one with Jordan College and a zeppelin station and personal daemons.While relaxing on the roof of Jordan College she espies a large flock of birds aggressively pursuing a lone bird who appears to be a witch's daemon. (You may recall that witches' daemons could be separated from their people and perform errands many thousands of miles away.) Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon manage to draw the bird into the building and protect it.The bird is on an errand from the witch Yelena Pazhets who is seaking a local alchemist named Sebastian Makepeace. Lyra and Pantalaimon locate the alchemist, upon which there is a surprise ending which I will not reveal. And there is an interesting lesson that Lyra learns from her experience.LYRA'S OXFORD is essentially a short story that will take only an hour to devour. The book contains a foldout map of Lyra's Oxford, plus a postcard from Mary Malone (the scientist introduced in THE SUBTLE KNIFE) and 1930-ish ads for cruises to various ports. The map and illustrations are nicely drawn, but do not contribute materially to one's enjoyment of the story.One gets the feeling that LYRA'S OXFORD consists of materials that Pullman didn't quite know at the time how to integrate into a larger structure. Not to worry, however, because the book is fun anyhow. If some day Pullman gets the full Tolkien treatment, there will be less expensive editions incorporating other short stories, but let's hope that doesn't happen for a long time. I want to see Pullman live for many more productive years. After all, I am addicted to his stories.

There are two Australias: there's the sanitized Australia of myth encompassing Crocodile Dundee, koalas and kangaroos, Nicholas Roeg's WALKABOUT, Peter Weir's early films, and Bruce Chatwin's THE SONGLINES. Then there's the gritty, no-hope, hardscrabble world of the stories in this GRANTA anthology.Good writing is alive and well Down Under. Some of the pieces were haunting, especially Ben Rice's &quot;Pobby and Dingan,&quot; about a child's invisible friends who take on a whole new reality; Paul Toohey's &quot;The Road to Ginger Riley,&quot; about the last days of a drunken journalist who wants to &quot;find&quot; Australia before he dies; and Thomas Keneally's &quot;My Father's Australia,&quot; about life in a small town before World War I.The Aborigines are a ghostly presence in this anthology, except for Robyn Davidson's eerie &quot;Marrying Eddie&quot; and Polly Borland's haunting photos and interviews of Aborigine men and women spiralling down into oblivion. There's no COOPER'S CREEK heroism here: You have to find your own way, Mate!However dark the vision of most of these selections, this volume is a worthy addition to GRANTA's growing library of stories and essays. When you pack your bags to go on vacation, you could do worse than take ANY volume of GRANTA with you. Each one is a window into a different world -- maybe not a pleasant one, but always a fascinating one.

How is it that a work so rich and powerful is so little known by literate, well-educated people? Is it that we are programmed to reject everything outside our ultra-narrow Western European/North American bandwidth?I first read this translation of NJALS SAGA over 10 years ago. The story set off a series of reactions in me such that, this year, I am planning to visit the sites where the story of Njall, Flossi, and Gunnar actually took place a millenium ago. (Archaeologists have located a burned-out farmstead at the site of the famous conflagration that dates back to that time.)The story of Njall's restraint, and his preference to die with his family in a fire set by his enemies rather than to perpetuate a feud, has a resonance in our own times: Consider the Yugoslavia of Milosovich, or the genocides between the Tutsi and the Hutu in Central Africa. Even Njall's enemies have to be goaded into committing atrocity: One character implies that Flossi, the arsonist, is weak because he has allowed himself to be sexually used by the Svinafell troll. Times haven't changed much.The saga contains scenes of great beauty. Gunnar of Hlidarendi, outlawed by the Althing and forced to flee for his life, takes one backward look. &quot;How fair the slopes are!&quot; he exclaims, and then decides to stay. Under attack by his enemies, he asks his wife for a length of her hair when his bowstring breaks. The &quot;thief-eyed&quot; Hallgerd Long-Legs refuses because he had slapped her once, and so he goes to his doom muttering that each person chooses his or her fame. True to his prophecy, Hallgerd is the ultimate type of the treacherous and spiteful wife.We seem to think of Icelanders as the scions of degenerate Vikings who never amounted to much. And yet they created a republic in A.D. 870 (!!) and gave birth to a literature that will be read and loved by those who have the mind and heart to appreciate them long after most mass-produced &quot;classics&quot; are hooted off the world stage.

I was sad to hear of Nigel Tranter's passing just days into the new millenium. This great historical writer who had the unique gift of making us see, hear, and feel the heartbeat of times long past, of kings half forgotten whose reputations were laid to rest often as quickly as they were.Robert the Bruce, hero of Bannockburn, was the grandfather of Robert II by his daughter Marjory, wife of Walter Stewart. The kings from this union came to be known as the Stewarts, and Robert II and his son Robert III were two of the weakest. Both, prematurely doddering and unwilling or unable to wield the power in the kingdom, yielded the real power to Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife and Menteith. This last Robert is a character of the type frequently found in Tranter novels: a stern, unyielding master of realpolitik. (See James Stewart in WARDEN OF THE QUEEN'S MARCH for a reincarnation.)The action is seen through the eyes of the fictional Jamie Douglas, descendent of the famed &quot;Black Douglas&quot; of Robert the Bruce's day, who tries to help shore up the monarchy for David, Duke of Rothesay, oldest son of Robert III.Scottish history can be incredibly murky and involved at times, and that's what makes it so fascinating. Tranter has a gift for breathing life into periperal characters and putting them into play across a wide landscape and over a long period of time.My favorite subplot involves the notorious Wolf of Badenoch, who burns down the Cathedral of Elgin, the so-called Lantern of the North, because of a dispute with its bishop. The Wolf's son, Alexander , becomes a steadfast friend and ally of Jamie Douglas.It was my great fortune to read this trilogy while criss-crossing Scotland. I would recommend someone new to Tranter starting with the Robert the Bruce trilogy, but after that, read THE STEWART TRILOGY.

Icelandic history is divided into three epochs: (1) the Saga Period, from the beginnings of settlement to the surrender of sovereignty in 1262; (2) the Colonial Period, under the thumb of first Norway and then Denmark, during which Iceland almost disappears from the world stage; and (3) the Period of Independence, from approximately 1809 to the present. In his HISTORY, Gunnar Karlsson adds a fourth epoch: the 20th century.Thanks to the great Icelandic sagas of the 13th Century, we know a great deal about the first period. (Some of the excitement comes across in Magnus Magnusson's little gem of a book entitled ICELAND SAGA.) Then, once Iceland lost her sovereignty in hopes of putting an end to strife between conflicting factions, she seemingly disappeared from history. Except, unfortunately, as a victim of catacylsmic volcanic eruptions, smallpox, plague, and an uncaring Danish administration.The 19th Century saw a simultaneous enlightenment in Denmark's stewardship of Iceland and a growingly successful independence movement among Icelanders. Between the two World Wars, Iceland became an independent state of some promise and no longer the Albania of the North Atlantic.There are several approaches to chronicling such an unusual history. Karlsson takes a heavily economically and statistically oriented approach, such that one cringes at the profusion of percent signs and dates and neat little tables. Suddenly, the author will abruptly switch gears and drop into a personal mode: &quot;Most important of these wield yielders was the Iceland moss ... a lichen that grows on inland heaths. It looks extremely unappetizing -- brownish and dry, like a shrivelled piece of skin.... I personally salivate when I think about it cooked in milk.&quot;Another time, he interjects: &quot;I myself did not live in a turf house for longer than a month and was unfortunately too young to remember much about it. But in my youth ... I sometimes visied such houses, which were dry, warm, clean, and reasonably bright.&quot;One wishes to encounter this reminiscing Gunnar Karlsson more frequently than the brownish, dry, shrivelled statistician that he so often resembles. A more anecdotal approach would have livened this book up considerably, relegating most of the economic facts to out-of-the-way footnotes. I would like to have met the Icelander at various stages of his country's history, but Karlsson restrains himself from introducing him. More's the pity, because Karlsson obviously knows his subject well.

This is a strangely muted, yet exquisitely crafted , story from the creator of the Travis McGee detective novels. Local wheeler-dealers in a West Florida town devise a residential development that involves filling in a beautiful bay, to the dismay of the town's conservationists. Jimmy Wing, newspaperman, professes to help both camps, but is really in it only for the chance the view the &quot;mechanism&quot; of the conflict at close quarters. In the end, everyone emerges a loser; and Wing finds he has won a pyrrhic victory over his detachment from humanity. In this book, MacDonald probably brushes uncomfortably close to his real persona.

I needed to buy a digital camera to help me sell merchandise on eBay and other online auctions. My camera store recommended the DC-240. My one big mistake was purchasing it from them instead of from Amazon.Com.The photographs taken by the DC-240 are excellent, and certainly have all the resolution and sharpness I require. In fact, I have to use a photo editor to tone them down and resize them so they don't take forever to load on the auction page.My only complaint is that uploading the photographs from the camera to my Windows ME system is very much a trial-and-error process. So it might be a good idea to get a separate bypass unit that goes straight from the flash memory to the computer.

Here's a delightful murder mystery set at Oxford and written by an Oxford don. Sadly, like many of the excellent Dover mystery series, it is out of print for now. A widely disliked don is found shot through the head in a colleague's rooms, and it becomes a process of elimination to find the culprit. A visiting professor from Vienna by the name of Alfred Brendel acts as a sleuth who discovers the culprit. This is a book whose atmospherics far outweigh the plot. As a mystery, it's a 5; but as a cultural artifact, it's a 10.

For Robert Waldron's enthusiasm toward the Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, I would have to give this book five stars -- and I must say the author's enthusiasm is catching. However ...The 100-odd pages of this slim book constitute an interior conversation that Robert Waldron carried on with the work of Thomas Merton in preparation for a religious retreat to be held on September 23, 2000 concentrating primarily on Merton's poetry. After a brief discussion of the author, the retreat was to analyze a selection of Merton's poems. This subject interested me, as I wish to know more about these poems myself.But although Waldron discussed his research, he never actually printed any of Merton's poems in its entirety (only a few tantalizing selections), and never once did he provide his own analysis of a Merton poem. Perhaps this was meant for another book?Instead of the poetry and a stab at a scholarly explication of same, there are numerous references to secondary and tertiary sources, many of which Waldron did not even see fit to include in his bibliography. Moreover, even within the book, the material is organized so informally that the same topic is occasionally touched on in two or even three places with slightly differing emphases.Perhaps ultimately my complaints are Pickwickian inasmuch as Waldron and I are on the same page where Merton and his importance are concerned. This is not the book that I hoped for, though it did have a good deal of useful information mentioned in passing.At least I have some idea of the preparations that Waldron undertook for his retreat.

Dashiell Hammett's Continental Op detective stories see the beginnings of the hard-boiled detective in American fiction. The nameless operative of the Continental Detective Agency that stars in all these stories is also faceless: All we know is that he's overweight. He's every bit as nasty as the later Sam Spade of THE MALTESE FALCON, and even approaches Jim Thompson's psychotically callous narrators. At one point, in &quot;The Farewell Murder,&quot; his reaction to his client's grisly murder by slashed throat is an apparent nonchalance -- though he does nab the murderer in the end.Between 1930 and today, however, there was a change in colloquial American that makes Hammett's language seem slightly fusty and unidiomatic today. The following are taken from my favorite story of the bunch, &quot;The Girl with the Silver Eyes.&quot; The larcenous Elvira, for example, &quot;sizes up as a worker.&quot; Another woman thinks her brother is &quot;a choice morsel.&quot; An odd prolixity appears in the sentence &quot;This Porky was an effective tool if handled right, which meant keeping your hand on his throat all the time and checking up every piece of information he brought in.&quot; A writer today would be more elliptical, but then. of course, the genre was still in its infancy.Where Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is a knight of the mean streets, the Op is an anonymous survivor. His name won't appear in the newspaper, but he'll collar the perpetrators and see them executed or otherwise put out of action. When the evidence is lacking, as in &quot;The Golden Horseshoe,&quot; he is content to have the criminal swing for a crime he did NOT commit. Better yet, in &quot;The House on Turk Street,&quot; he will arrange for the hoods to kill each other and walk away unharmed.Even more than 75 years after they were written, these stories have something to tell us about ourselves today. Chandler was an Englishman; but Hammett was clearly a home-grown product of the streets. A former detective himself, he knew well the dark recesses of the American criminal mind, sometimes frighteningly so.

What is a self-proclaimed intellectual doing watching (and loving) Elvis films? I make no claims about Norman Taurog as a director, nor about the credibility of the script, nor about the authenticity of the Hawaiian music. I DO claim, however, that Elvis is the The King. The songs, the music, and the singing are fantastic. Everything else is strung onto Elvis like strings of popcorn around a Christmas tree.Not all Elvis films are this good. What makes this one better are the glossy production values; and the letterbox print definitely helps. Angela Lansbury puts in a highly amusing performance as Elvis's ditzy Southern Belle mama (after all, Hawaii is the southernmost state, no?). The whole story hinges around Elvis's return from the military and his desire to return to his cozy beach bum existence, while mater and pater want him to join the family pineapple firm.The King, of course, is subject to no law. He goes into the tour guide business, marshalling a well-preserved teacher and her four teenage charges around the islands. His Franco-Hawaiian girlfriend is jealous that there's more than tourism going on behind closed doors.At the end, everything comes together. Elvis gets hitched AND finds a way to work in tourism and for the pineapple firm at the same time. All is at peace in the world, and the music wells up. Finis.

"Poor Mexico" exclaimed dictator Porfirio Diaz, "so far from God and so close to the United States!" That says it all. The entire border is a huge Zone of Distortion warped by the looming proximity of the Giant to the North. I felt it as far south as Los Mochis, Durango and Chihuahua, and did not feel entirely free of it until I got to Guanajuato and Queretaro.Poor Hector Belascoaran Shayne has been knifed, shot at, and even left for dead -- but Paco Taibo keeps bringing him back for more. In this case, it is childhood crush Natalia Smith-Corona, an actress whose daughter has reported her missing and sends the stout detective on a hallucinogenic chase among the narcotraficantes, DEA agents, ambiguous chiefs of police, 300 whores from Zacatecas, and other loonies -- the worst of whom is a right winger named Quayle (sadly, no relation to the former vice president).FRONTERA DREAMS is not quite linear in its organization, resembling at times some of those strange Italian spy movies of the 1960s that capitalized on the James Bond craze. If you don't like the feeling of not knowing where you are going, this novel will not please you.On the other hand, if you see it as a shaggy dog story that, as it moves rapidly from one location to the next, gives you some feeling of the strangeness of El Border, you might enjoy it as much as I have. This is my third Shayne novel, and I look forward to reading all of them, if only someone would come along and translate the first of the series (DIAS DE COMBATE) into English.

THE LADIES' PARADISE is a sequel to POT LUCK (POT-BUILLE), which I read last year. Both have Octave Mouret as a central character. In the earlier novel, he was a young salesman on the make, both in his profession and with the young women in his apartment building. At the end of POT LUCK, he marries the owner of a successful drapery establishment. At the start of PARADISE, his wife has died; and Octave has entered on an expansion program from drapery into a department store named the Ladies' Paradise that threatens all the other shopkeepers selling clothing and accessories in the area.Enter Denise Baudu, a country girl from Normandy, who moves to Paris with her two brothers after one of them has gotten in trouble back home. Her uncle runs a store called Au Vieil Elbeuf, selling drapery and flannels, but is unable to give her room or a job because business is threatened by the presence of the Ladies' Paradise across the street. Denise finds a job at the Paradise at the risk of angering her relatives.Salesgirls at the Paradise live in a dormitory on the top floor of the department store. Room and board is part of the job, plus a token wage and commissions on sales over quota. Little does Denise know she had entered into a whirlwind of gossip and backbiting. She is made fun of by her fellow workers, but Mouret resists getting rid of her because he is drawn to her. At one point, however, two of Mouret's "spies" in management come upon Denise and a young salesman from her region who has sheepishly fallen in love with her and kisses her hand as head axe-wielder Bourdoncle watches. Denise is promptly dismissed.As Denise finds another position in a less profitable store than the Paradise, the focus turns more to Mouret, who did not know of her dismissal. Mouret plans a large-scale expansion of the store and calls upon Baron Hartman (in real life, Baron Haussmann) to allow him frontage on the new boulevard being cut through the neighborhood.One day, Mouret runs into Denise on the street and asks her to consider returning to the Paradise, which is just as well as the store where Denise had started to work was going under. To sweeten the offer, Mouret makes her an assistant buyer in the new children's wear department. With her enhanced status, Denise is now winning admiration from her co-workers, though some backbiters remain. In the meantime, Mouret's passion for her is growing -- despite Denise not encouraging it in any way.There are several set pieces in the novel which are a feature of Zola's fiction. They come under the heading of giant mechanisms that grind people down. In GERMINAL, it was a coal mine; in POT LUCK, an apartment building; in HUMAN BEAST, railroads; and in THE BELLY OF PARIS, the food market at Les Halles. In every Zola novel, there are scenes showing off some giant mechanism at work crushing people under it like the wheels of a Juggernaut. In PARADISE, these scenes are highly successful sales which show a crush of frenetically spending customers and overwhelmed sales clerks as Mouret keeps "pushing the envelope" of what is possible in the apparel business. Even wealthy shoppers who came "just to look" are caught up in the frenzy and leave the store having committed themselves to buy more than what they could afford.The owners of neighboring shops feel that the Paradise is like a hungry beast that strives to devour their businesses and put them out in the street. Which is exactly what happens. Denise's cousin Genevieve dies of consumption after her lover Colomban -- the main hope of Au Vieil Elbeuf -- runs away to chase a slutty Paradise shopgirl who is one of Mouret's cast-offs, and who doesn't even want him. Aunt Baudu follows her daughter soon after. When as the result of a series of sharp moves, Mouret buys their properties, the shopkeepers are evicted; and Uncle Baudu goes to a nursing home, completely dazed and broken.Eventually, Denise and Mouret do hook up, but on Denise's terms. The novel ends as they announce their upcoming marriage.I have found that the ten or so Zola novels I have read have been of a uniform high quality, such that I have difficulty recommending one over the other (though I have a particular fondness for NANA). THE LADIES' PARADISE is an excellent read and paints a fascinating picture of life in the emerging Paris department stores of the late 19th century.

My love of films came to fruition during a brief period when the "auteur theory" held sway in the 1960s and 1970s. Auteurist critic Andrew Sarris classified Billy Wilder in his "Less Than Meets the Eye Category," primarily because he was "too cynical for the more serious demands of middle-class tragedy (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) and social allegory (ACE IN THE HOLE). A director who can crack jokes about suicide attempts ... and thoughtlessly brutalize charming actresses like Jean Arthur (FOREIGN AFFAIR) and Audrey Hepburn (SABRINA) is hardly likely to make a coherent film on the human condition."It was only as a result of seeing Wilder's films that I discovered what Sarris was really saying was that the director was both too versatile and too successful -- and it didn't help that his approach to directing films was as a writer rather than as a visual artist.Reading Charlotte Chandler's oral history of Wilder's career, I was impressed with Billy Wilder's ability to be able to create iconic native masterpieces of film noir (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) and Hollywood Gothic (SUNSET BOULEVARD) without the benefit of growing up in the United States. While his later comedies (such as SOME LIKE IT HOT) owe much to his collaboration with Lubitsch, Hawks, and Mitchell Leisen, Wilder developed his own style of comedy and retained his ability to make good films well into his eighties.In the chapter on SUNSET BOULEVARD, actress Nancy Olson makes an astute comment: "Billy said, 'Every character in SUNSET BOULEVARD is an opportunist.' It seemed to me that what he is saying is that this picture is not only about opportunism, but about ... the consequences of it."A little light bulb went on in my mind. Wilder's films are all, in their own way, about opportunism. Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson take advantage of each other for their own nefarious ends in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. In picture after picture, I see a pattern of characters using one another with interesting results, with the ultimate example being Kirk Douglas in ACE IN THE HOLE.Chandler's interviews are mostly interesting, though the intrusion of plot summaries in the middle of each chapter is intrusive: These should have been relegated to the Filmography in the back of the book. I was disturbed that Chandler did not see fit to add any of her own observations about Wilder except insofar as to provide a segue for the many quotes. Still, it is both a useful and entertaining book and a valuable addition to the literature about this fascinating filmmaker.

Bernard Lewis has spent more than half a century studying Islam, and his erudition makes this a particularly worthwhile book at a time when Islamic and Western Civilizations appear to be on a collision course.For its first 900 years, Islamic Civilization was on an incredible winning streak. The First Crusade was a victory for the West -- but it was all too short-lived. Then came Lepanto and the Siege of Malta, and crushing defeats at the hands of the Austrians and Hungarians. The tide was turned, and the Turks and their subject peoples were nonplussed.Lewis shows that there have been two conflicting responses in the Muslim world to its reduced circumstances. The Turks by and large have attempted to understand the West, and at times were way off the mark. Lewis quotes one Turkish traveler as saying the Austrian emperor was polite and deferential toward ladies because of the Virgin Mary!The other response is what we are encountering now: namely, Islamic fundamentalism. Many Muslims see their recent defeats as the result of insufficient attention to the old ways. The mullahs that taught the al-Qaeda terrorists emphasized study of the Koran and rejection of all Western elements in their society, except what was absolutely required to defeat the infidels.In Islamic society, as Lewis points out, there is no secularism. All government, all trade, all interactions are dictated by the Koran. The only exception seems to be Turkey, which has benefited from the reforms of Kemal Ataturk. In his THE COMING ANARCHY, Robert Kaplan indicates that, alone among the Muslim nations, Turkey appears to be stable and viable enough to last out the coming storm.This is a short book, but one that will make you stop and think. I also recommend that, if you like it, you look at some other of Lewis's work, including THE ARABS IN HISTORY.

Carlos Fuentes had a brief but tempestuous affair with actress Jean Seberg over thirty years ago. The encounter seems to have marked him, for this book is a barely disguised roman a clef (where Diana Soren = Jean Seberg) about his relationship. It is like one of those European stories where the man gives up everything to follow some vixen, including his money, family, and peace of mind. Luis Bunuel (who actually appears in this novel as a character) created the ultimate masterpiece of the genre with his film THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE.Jean Seberg has come down to us today as a tortured sado-masochistic saint who still has the power to beguile men. Film posters and stills featuring her and her movies command a premium in today's cinememorabilia market; and I know several collectors who seek out anything they can find depicting her. Perhaps, what Marilyn Monroe was for the 1950s, Jean Seberg was for the 1960s.Why Fuentes wrote this novel in the way he did puzzles me. If I were as obsessed as he was, I would still feel queasy about exposing the dirty bedsheets and underwear to the gaze of the public. To me, love -- however brief or unhappy -- is a gift of the gods; and by spiting it, one shows oneself to be somehow unworthy. Fuentes has flouted a gift whose memory I would have locked away in the deepest recesses of my being and thrown away the key.If, however, Fuentes feels himself to have been traduced by his relationship, like Charles Swann at the end of Proust's SWANN'S WAY after his recognition of Odette's unfaithfulness, I could understand his need to exorcise this "expense of spirit in a waste of shame."Instead, I see both the anger and the gratefulness simultaneously. As a result, DIANA THE GODDESS WHO HUNTS ALONE leaves me with a feeling of unease, as if the author did not know his own mind and went off in several emotional directions at once.The result is a very well written book that in the end does not quite jell. One can't worship at the shrine and spit at it at the same time.

G. K. Chesterton was probably the greatest optimist who ever lived. He BELIEVED where most of us give up and become despondent. The three stories in this volume take place in a strange twilight world in which the author, as he says in THURSDAY, makes you want to see the lamppost by the light of the tree rather than vice versa. This, by the way, is his most profound and eccentric book.In THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY, we see an incredible global conspiracy dissipate like swamp gas. (As Calvin Coolidge once said, nine out of ten of the troubles one sees down the road swerve off and disappear before they get to you.) THE BALL AND THE CROSS is about two heretics who appear to fight each other to the bitter end, until they find a worse enemy. And THE CLUB OF QUEER TRADES is a delightful entertainment made up of wonderful shaggy dog stories, much like THE PARADOXES OF MR POND.If life hasn't been going your way, curl up with this volume -- and you WILL feel better.

The story that Charles Darwin tells in his excellent VOYAGE OF THE H.M.S. BEAGLE is only the first act of a three-act drama. In it, Captain Robert Fitzroy of the Beagle picked up a 14-year-old Yahgan Indian boy whom he called Jemmy Button after the mother-of-pearl button from his uniform that he uses to pay for him. He added a girl he called Fuegia Basket and an older Yahgan he called York Minster. After the five-year voyage of the beagle, Fitzroy took the three to England where much was made of them. (They even got an audience with Queen Victoria.) Then they were taken back after their moment in the sun and left back in the wilds of Tierra del Fuego.In the second act, savagery re-asserted itself. York Minster ran off with Fuegia, with whom he had formed a close attachment; and Jemmy was robbed by his tribe of all the presents he received from British well-wishers. Around the same time, British Evangelicals decided to target the Indians of Tierra Del Fuego for conversion. Several attempts were made, resulting in misunderstandings and even a major massacre. Jemmy Button was thought to be responsible for the biggest of these massacres and was arrested and tried in the Falkland Islands, but was finally acquitted for lack of direct evidence.Finally, Christianity took hold when Thomas Bridges, a minister who not only spoke that Yahgan tongue but had created a Yahgan-English dictionary, arrived and settled at what is now Ushuaia. But while the Indians began arriving at the mission, it was noticed that their population has begun to shrink rather drastically. Jemmy and Fuegia had died, and it is learned that York Minster had died earlier. One would bet that a naked aboriginal population would have a difficult time surviving in a sub-arctic climate under the best of circumstances, but now the die-off accelerated until not a single Yahgan -- even a half-breed -- was left after the 1960s.Who were the three men of the Beagle referred to in Marks's title? Jemmy was one of them because of his leadership role in his tribe. The other two were Charles Darwin and Captain (later Admiral) Robert Fitzroy.Back in England, Darwin lived a comfortable life. He held back announcing his claims about evolution until it became evident that a rival, Alfred Russel Wallace, would beat him to publication. So Darwin came out with THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES in 1859, more than 20 years after the Beagle voyage. Fitzroy, still Darwin's friend, opposed Darwin's conclusions, as he was always the more religious of the two -- despite the seeming contradiction that Darwin had originally desired to become a clergyman. As Darwin's star grew in the firmament, Fitzroy's waned, until one day in a fit of despondency he slit his throat with a straight razor.We tend to forget Fitzroy, but he also contributed something that affects all of us on a daily basis: He almost single-handedly invented the weather forecast by his clever use of barometer readings across the British Isles in conjunction with telegraphic communications.Richard Lee Marks has written a fascinating book about the clash of cultures between European civilization and a savage society, followed by a clash of cultures within England itself -- between the religious and scientific cultures. That clash is still going on today.

It all began in 1927 with this film. It took a German director (Paul Leni) to teach America how to make haunted house films; and there have been hundreds of imitators. The whole repertoire is there: corridors with curtains blowing in the wind, trick bookcase/doors, mysterious sliding panels, corpses that fall stiffly toward the camera as a door opens, secret passages, the eerie housekeeper.The expressionist prologue begins with the death of Cyrus West, a millionaire paranoid who felt like a canary in a cage surrounded by ravenous catlike relatives (hence the title) in his lonely castle-like mansion on the Hudson. We get a chance to see these relatives, but most of them come across as ineffectual and somewhat funny. In fact, after the first 15 minutes, Leni begins to have some fun with the story. We lose track of all the complications, until everything comes clear in the last reel. The grim-faced housekeeper, &quot;Mammy Pleasant,&quot; is hilariously spooky; and the rest of the cast, including stars Laura La Plante and Creighton Hale, put in a good performance.This Kino release is based on a print from the mammoth David Bradley Collection. It is paired with an innocuous Harold Lloyd short entitled &quot;Haunted Spooks,&quot; produced by Hal Roach. I think that CAT AND THE CANARY should have starred Lloyd in the Creighton Hale role: It seemed to be made for him.

In an unusual turnabout for a Victorian novel, we have here three cases of women being very uncertain about their men -- to the point of, in one case, jilting a fiance and, in the other, with threatening to abandon a marriage by running off with an infamous ne'er-do-well. Also, we have Anthony Trollope's most dastardly villain, the ambitious and egoistic George Vavasor, with a visible fault line through his face for expressing rage.In a Trollope novel, everything is not as it seems. The institution of marriage, in particular, comes in for some hard knocks -- all from the point of view of the women involved. Alice Vavasor, Lady Glencora Palliser, and Arabella Greenow come from the aristocracy and the upper middle class. All three women in the course of the novel grow and change before our eyes.As the first novel in the six-book Palliser series, _Can You Forgive Her?_ also introduces us to the world of high politics. Sir Plantagenet Palliser is about to become Chancellor of the Exchequer; and George Vavasor dips into his fiancee's fortune to run twice as a Member of Parliament for Chelsea. Trollope had always wanted to become an MP himself, and ran once (and lost) for the borough of Beverley. His bad experiences were the stuff of some masterful election scenes in novels, notably the much underestimated _Ralph the Heir_.Other Trollope set pieces include a fabulous fox hunt in Book I, in which the author himself appears under another name. There is also a dispute over an inheritance; fascinating legal trickery in George Vavasor's borrowings from his fiancee; and the typical Trollope developing of his characters' weaknesses until they pop.While over 800 pages in length, I felt as if this was less than half that. Yes, reading Trollope requires a commitment; but his books are intriguing enough to reward it. This is one of my favorites.

Years ago, I had purchased this volume and Volume III in the old Harper Colophon paperback edition. I had to wait over 20 years before Volume I came back into print -- and then in one glorious summer I read all three volumes. (Just recently, I sprang for the deluxe Folio Society hardbound edition: I mean to re-read it some day.)If you have any interest in the Middle Ages, or even in the pre-history of today's Middle East crises, this series is your starting point. The crusades bring together the best and worst of men, from Godfrey of Bouillon and Saladin on one hand, to the bickering kinglets of the later Crusades on the other.The story of the Crusader Kingdoms is the subject of this volume. It is a long story of greed and attrition, leading to their extinction as the Saracens' power waxed and the Western monarchies' political will and religious zeal waned. The rise of nationalism in Western Europe sounded the death knell to the centuries'-long quest to regain the Holy Land.Curiously, it was the Saracens who were tolerant to their subject peoples, and the Crusader Kingdoms who were not. The Jews and Christians had a much better time of it under Turkish rule than under the voracious princelings of the Kindgoms of Armenia, Edessa, Jerusalem, and so on. We have yet to learn our lessons from this conflict -- and we are still paying the price.

This is a large, seemingly amorphous anti-novel composed of hundreds of stories -- but no characters who are named. There is no character development, no denoument: In a word, the unities of Aristotle are trashed.But SOUL MOUNTAIN is a veritable Everest among books. I spent a month savoring it slowly. Each day brought new spiritual and picaresque episodes. Interspersed is a story of a difficult relationship that begins in Wuyizhen in the early episodes and lurches forward and backward until it ends in a strange stand-off toward the end. Gao avoids the big cities and travels along the southern mountain regions of China, frequently in areas not populated by the majority Han population, in search of Linshan, or soul mountain.Does he make it? Yes ... and no! It was always just across the river all the time (in a manner of speaking). Gao laments in advance the destruction about to be wreaked by the building of the projected Three Gorges dam. His China is in the course of assimilation into the Han culture, so he seeks the folkways of minority populations, the poetry, music, festivals, and religious observances.&quot;Even I can't distinguish how much is experience,&quot; writes Gao, &quot;and how much is dreams within my memories and impressions, so how can you distinguish between what I have experienced and what are figments of my imagination? And in the end is it necessary to make such distinctions? In any case, they aren't of any significance whatsoever.&quot;He's right, too. This is a book that transforms the reader. All that is asked of the reader is to shed his plausibilist prejudices and drift in the stream. The ride is well worth it!

It's not easy to dive cold into the world of the Icelandic saga. One of the advantages of reading HRAFNKEL'S SAGA and the shorter sagas and tales in this volume is that you get a good idea of the best of the genre in less than 150 pages. According to Magnus Magnusson in his excellent book ICELAND SAGA, &quot;it is nothing short of a masterpiece, a brilliantly wrought short novel that has been published and translated and written about more than any other saga.&quot;Given that, what can you expect? In the strange world of the Icelandic saga, there is little mention of the deity other than in passing: To the Icelanders of the classic age, all that mattered is what strength and cunning and stamina YOU had, and whether you could rely upon any stouthearted friends of like mettle in a pinch. At the heart of every saga are one or more conflicts. The better man does not always win; justice does not always triumph. Hrafnkel is heroic, but he is no hero: In our time, he would be a convicted felon for slaughtering his shepherd Einar. In the age of the Vikings, he was a stern man of his word in whom people could rely.Curiously, even in today's Iceland, adherence to the Judaeo-Christian tradition is seen only as an alternative, one imposed from without. The minister at the pulpit is as likely to discuss Hrafnkel and the other great Saga heroes as he is the Gospels. In a way, the sagas are taken as scripture.The oddest thing of all is that most of them were probably written by Medieval monks: Christianity there underwent a strange sea change into something rich and strange.So as you read these instructive tales, consider that they represent a different world view in a tiny island nation whose people know them by heart. The Icelandic language today is virtually identical to the Old Norse spoken by the first settlers of Iceland. Imagine if English were identical to the Anglo-Saxon of BEOWULF!

There are two ways of reading an Icelandic saga: (1) as a rip-roaring adventure in which people do terrible things to each other and (2) as history involving real events with real people. When I visited the Orkneys last year, I saw many of the actual locales discussed in the saga: the Brough of Birsay, where Saint Magnus grew to adulthood; Earl's Bu, the drinking hall of the earls of the Orkneys; and various places where the saga's chief villain, Svein Asleifarson, axed or burned his enemies, among whom were most of those living at the time.The saga tells of a 200-year stretch of time when the Orkneys -- islands off the northern tip of Scotland -- owed their allegiance to the Kings of Norway. For the Viking marauders who ravaged Europe, the Orkneys were a friendly refueling stop on the inbound and outbound voyages. The earls ruled not only the islands, but large chunks of the Scottish mainland and most of the Hebrides as well. So widespread were their lands that they were frequently forced into power-sharing arrangements with their kinsmen, which then turned into power struggles to the death. The best instance of this is between the co-earls and cousins (Saint) Magnus Erlendsson and Hakon Paulsson.It was common in those days, if one had a disagreement, to wait until one's enemy was in his cups; then pile dry rushes against the doors and set them alight. Men, women, and children escaping the flames were hacked to death by waiting swordsmen. This happened not once, but several times in the ORKNEYINGA SAGA. And yet, there is also poetry, craft, and a strange beauty in this book which make it more than a Grand Guignol with Vikings. Here, on the bleak northern edges of civilization, the novel was born while our Western European ancestors were quaking in their boots.At first, reading an Icelandic saga is like reading a Russian novel: There are all those long names that are so similar to one another. The anonymous author of the sagas couldn't help it: These were their real names.Today, the men and deeds set forth in the saga are very much a part of the everyday life of the Orkneys. It is, therefore, the one book that you must absolutely read before visiting this remote and fascinating part of Scotland.

This saga tells much the same story as BEOWULF -- 500 years later and from half an ocean away. In their volcanic fastnesses, the Icelanders not only told and retold the famous Sagas of Icelanders, but also sagas of kings, warriors, and saints -- even when they had little or nothing to do with Iceland. As the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus wrote around 1200, Icelanders &quot;take great pleasure in discovering and commemmorating the achievements of all nations; in their view, it is as enlightening to discourse on the prowess of others as to display their own.&quot;Fortunately, this book is translated and edited by Professor Jesse L Byock of UCLA, whose VIKING AGE ICELAND is a model introduction to the subject of the Icelandic saga. In addition to providing an excellent translation, Byock's introduction is both thorough and enlightening; and, typical of his work, there are illustrative maps, drawings, genealogies, notes, charts and tables, and a useful glossary of characters.If you've read BEOWULF, why bother cracking Kraki? For one thing, the Icelanders are great story-tellers, and the saga is a great read. I found it interesting that while the saga was written some 350 years into the Christian era, it is every bit as pagan as the Anglo-Saxon story. Odin appears in disguise twice in the story, with nary a bishop or saint in the offing. (Only a few oblique references toward the end point to some inkling of Christianity.) It has long been my contention that Christianity sat ever so lightly on the mailed shoulders of the Icelanders. The grim gods of the Asatru never quite disappeared. In fact, it would not be surprising if the SAGA OF KING HROLF KRAKI were written by Christian monks at Skalholt or Holar or some other monastic community.Picture the long dark Arctic winter nights in those scattered sod huts with their grass roofs. There was nothing like good food and drink punctuated with a story of great warriors and the supernatural to make the time pass quickly. Funny thing, it still reads well today.

The twilight world of the great Icelandic sagas can be difficult for an outsider to understand. We are so fixated on the values of the Western European mainland that it is easy for us to overlook Iceland's many contributions. The great 13th century sagas like Burnt Njal, Laxdaela, and Egil are high water marks of medieval literature -- far more sophisticated than the Arthurian fantasies circulating in Britain and France at the time.To read and understand these sagas properly, one requires a key. And this is precisely the value of Byock's work: It places the sagas in a societal context and shows us that -- while Europe was stuck in a feudal rut -- Iceland was a unique republic in which power was distributed among many 30-50 chieftains. If a chieftain failed to be responsive, a landowner could change his allegiance to another, irrespective of his location. Because there were no standing armies in the time of the sagas, it was the responsiveness of the chieftain in assisting with disputes that was the prime determinant of his power, and not brute force.Byock shows us how the system worked by a series of helpful extended examples taken directly from the sagas. These are by far the best parts of the book. Read this book, and you will see that at the heart of the great sagas are tales of how conflicts were resolved, sometimes over a period of many generations. Although many lives were lost, the fabric of society remained whole and relatively undisturbed because a consensus was finally reached.I look forward to reading Byock's other Icelandic book on Feud in the Icelandic Saga.

It was at Hilo Hattie's cavernous store in Honolulu in 1996 that I first made the acquaintance of Iz's music. Knowing less than nothing about Hawaiian music and waiting for my girlfriend to finish her shopping, I put an earphone on my head and listened to several tracks from the featured artists. The first cut -- &quot;Hawai'i '78 Introduction&quot; -- from FACING FUTURE was a revelation to me. When the goosebumps subsided, I bought all the Iz CDs I could find.Having neither the ear nor the words to describe music properly, let me stumble through this: Iz's sweet voice has a range and a depth like nothing else I have ever heard. He was like an angel come down to earth. Whether he sang in Hawai'ian or English didn't make any difference. What I was hearing was sweeter than any opera aria I had ever heard, and that is the only thing I could compare it with. The 14th track -- &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow (What a Wonderful World)&quot; -- with its single ukulele accompaniment was simple and yet elegant, deep, and emotionally satisfying.Forget comparisons. Iz was an original with incredible crossover potential when his life was cut short in 1997. If you have not heard him, you have an incredible treat ahead of you!

Michael Chabon's book both amazed and appalled me: Amazed, because I was entraced by the spell woven by this marvelous novel, and appalled, because I had not realized how far we as a people had strayed from the notion of a land of opportunity and almost boundless possibility.Like the book's heroes, I too was in the spell of comic books and magic -- though mine was the next generation after World War II. I read Uncle Scrooge comics with their wonderful Carl Barks stories and drawings. (Living in Southern California, I still half believe that earthquakes are caused by contention between the subterranean Terries and Fermies.) The superheroes were there, too, and I distinctly remember Classic Comic Books such as "The Prisoner of Zenda" and even novelty 3-D comic books that came with glasses, such as those featuring the Three Stooges.KAVALIER & KLAY dredged up my own boyhood, and that world of superhero flummery that I took so seriously. When my neighbor's house was trashed in a break-in, I remember creating innumerable scenarios featuring me in colorful skintight pajamas saving their cute daughter Patricia, who would thank me in unthinkable ways in those pre-pubescent times.I don't know if Chabon's New York City ever really existed; but I would like to think it did. KAVALIER & KLAY comes complete with very realistic footnotes which are part of the fiction but convincing enough to make me think. If you are as intrigued by the book as I am, I refer you to the excellent bibliography at the end of the book, as well as the author's superb website.You do not have to be an aficionado of comic books, magic, or Jewish history to like this book. If you are a person of spirit, however, I fully expect the book will affect you as it did me, and send you delving into Houdini, the history of the Golem, the Golden Age of Comic Books, and the recent history of New York as shown in the work of A.J. Liebling, Brendan Gill, E.B. White, and others. Chabon has sent me on a quest, and the game is afoot!

Every city has a street where the most pathetic bums congregate, where the filthiest flophouses and scariest bars are to be found. That's also where you'll find David Goodis's characters: Wherever they begin, you will find they will plummet to the lowest depths like a sinker.Alvin Darby is married to a beautiful brunette and works in an office making good money as an actuary, but there is a wild hair (literally) up his craw. He is drawn to a strange vision of a platinum blonde and can't quite figure why. Before he married, he ran around with one such blonde named Geraldine but found her too capricious. But his marriage starts to unravel as he suspects his wife of infidelity. Instead of confronting her, however, he loses himself in the platinum blonde dream and begins to frequent low bars and lower company.Sigmund Freud would approve of how Alvin confronts his past -- pardon me, but I can't divulge the secret -- and begins the slow process of redemption.Goodis is always worth reading, and this is one of his best, if not one of his better known. This British Serpent's Tail edition comes with a respectful if not exactly accurate introduction by Adrian Wootton, who seems to think the SATURDAY EVENING POST was a newspaper. I am grateful that Serpent's Tail published OF TENDER SIN and look forward to obtaining their other Goodis titles.

Warning: Although this the action of this book is set on Mars, it could just as easily have taken place in one of the desert communities around Los Angeles. The real action takes place inside the minds of the characters. If you're looking for all the external trappings of interplanetary Sci-Fi, you will be deeply disappointed. Approach it with an open mind, and you will be richly rewarded.What happens when one of the most powerful men on the planet Mars finds that real-estate speculators are intent on gobbling up the remote and seemingly worthless Franklin D Roosevelt mountains? Naturally he wants to find out why. A casual conversation with a psychologist followed by a chance encounter with a master repairman leads to one of those Dickian leaps: Since (1) autistic children do not respond to others because they are living in the future, (2) just build a machine to slow down time and (3) maybe even use it to go back in time and retroactively post a claim on the land before the speculators do.Well, the mechanism works, in a way. The speculators were proposing to build giant apartment blocks to help relieve overcrowding on polluted Earth. The autistic boy, Manfred Steiner, sees much further, however, to the time the apartment block would become a warehouse for the sick and dying, a "tomb world," of which he himself is a denizen. Manfred's visions have a way of bending the reality of those around him; he persistently retreats to a vision of reality as "gubble" -- entropy seen as large wormlike constructs that underlie reality, leading to pure "gubbish."MARTIAN TIME-SLIP is one of my favorite Philip K Dicks. (The problem is that I like all 15 or so I've read more or less equally.) Reading Philip K Dick tends to bend your sense of reality much as Manfred Steiner does. And one can't help looking over one's shoulder for a few hours after reading him.I see Dick as not so much a science fiction writer as a creator of disturbing and eerily plausible futures.

It is 1911. After thousands of years, the rule of the Chinese emperors is about to come to an end. It is the Beijing of Bernardo Bertolucci's THE LAST EMPEROR. The 5-year-old Pu-Yi is emperor; and political power is in the hands of a Regent.A character named Victor Segalen engages two tutors in the Chinese language. One is Chinese; the other is a 17-year-old Belgian by the name of Ren&eacute; Leys who has a certain facility for languages. The narrator, Victor, wishes to penetrate into the heart of the Forbidden City at the heart of the capital. He wishes to "know" China in every way, including the Biblical sense of the world.The very first words of Segalen's disturbing novel are, "I shall know no more, then. Well, I shall not insist; I shall retire from the field ... respectfully, let it be said, and of course backwards, since court etiquette will have it so, and since it is a question of the Imperial Palace, and of an audience that was never granted, and that never will be granted..."After this initial admission of failure, the book goes back earlier in the same year, as Victor falls more and more under the spell of Ren&eacute;. It seems that the Belgian youth has achieved everything that Victor wants. He is a member of the palace's Secret Police; the Regent grants him a young concubine in the palace; he has even won to the heart and bed of the Dowager Empress (not the same one that contributed to the Boxer Rebellion, who was by now dead). The novel grows ever more feverish as young Ren&eacute; appears to be more tightly wrapped up in the life of the Forbidden City even as Victor grows more dispirited about his own efforts.Or is he? This question is at the heart of Segalen's novel. The story grows ever more feverish as Victor's desires to be admitted to the Celestial Presence are foiled, even as Ren&eacute; ascends ever higher in the Imperial hierarchy.I am reminded of a scene in Franz Kafka's THE TRIAL, in which a young man awaits his whole life to be admitted to the law, but the gatekeepers ever refuse him admission. Finally, as he is about to die, the man asks the gatekeeper why no one else in all the years had sought admission at that gate, whereupon the answer is, "No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended for you. I am now going to shut it."Many readers of this book will end up puzzled or frustrated, because Segalen does not choose to wrap the story up neatly. The desire he has to become part of what seems so patently unknowable gives rise to a nightmarish atmosphere and a growing sense of unreality that reaches a climax at the end of the novel.I for one was enthralled the whole way through. So what if RENE LEYS is a mystery wrapped inside an enigma (which also pretty much describes its author's life). This little-known novel is just another excellent offering of the fledgeling NYRB imprint whose offerings are occupying ever so much more of my reading time.

My first impression of Bradbury's DUST is that it is an artifact of times past. From the Charles Addams cover to the engravings interspersed throughout the body of the text, I get a feeling of a book produced over half a century ago. A glance at the copyright page (which for some reason is on page 203 -- after the text) shows that large parts of the book were originally written in the 1940s.Somehow, Bradbury linked them to a connecting story of a resurgent &quot;normal&quot; humanity threatening the vampires, werewolves, witches, and what-all residing in a strange Illinois farmhouse. And it all somehow works! It doesn't matter that the book contains elements that are dated across a wide spectrum of 55 years, which adds a poignant feel to the strangeness of the house's family members.The book's subtitle is &quot;A Family Remembrance.&quot; Bradbury created another Addams family with real family values and with a real family's centrifugal and centripetal tendencies. In the end, it is one of Timothy's &quot;uncles&quot; who betrays the family, leading to its dispersal to the four winds.Ever since I read FAHRENHEIT 451 and THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, I've felt that Ray Bradbury is one of our national treasures. There is a kind of sympathetic sadness, a loving kindness that permeates his work. Outer space is for him never far from the human soul, and vice versa. It has the effect of giving his work a universality that transcends genre writing.I expect to return to FROM THE DUST RETURNED, most probably in October, the month that will be forever associated with Bradbury.

If you are passionate about your beliefs and if you live long enough, you, too, can be like Ishiguro's Masuji Ono: Cast adrift by the next generation, who reacts to your past triumphs with embarrassed silence.The beliefs about which Ono was most passionate, however, revolve around his advocacy of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere of the military clique that invaded Pearl Harbor. As an art advisor to the government, he turns in his most talented pupil Kuroda to the police, who torture him before releasing him. For most of the book, Ishiguro delicately reveals in minute increments the truth about Ono's involvement in the past regime and its effect on his life.What begins as irony softens as the novel comes to an end and we finally discover the worst is over. Ono has survived. Many of his friends have not. &quot;Ripeness is all.&quot; The floating world of the title refers to the sweet life of bars and geishas as shown by such Japanese painters as Utamaro, but here also takes on another meaning. Whether one had followed Hitler or Pinochet or Franco or Tojo, the world is full of survivors who floated through their lives taking on the coloration of their milieu.Ishiguro paints with delicate strokes, but there is congealed blood on his palette.

Graham Greene is one of those writers whom you wouldn't necessarily want to meet socially -- however great their works might be. You could be in for some scintillating conversation, or just as likely for embarassed silence or a dose of that gold-plated chip on the shoulder. At one point in a restaurant, Greene stands up and makes a loud public announcement that some poor tourist was eavesdropping on his conversation. Another time, he publicly berates the author's husband, translator Francis Steegmuller, for feeding stray cats.For over 40 years, Graham Greene spent Spring and Autumn at his villa in Anacapri. During much of that time, Shirley Hazzard and Steegmuller were also in attendance and struck up as close a friendship as that truculent Englishman would allow. Rather than a formal biography, GREENE ON CAPRI is a delightfully impressionistic book about Greene, the island they all held in common (though Green knew astonishingly little about its history), and the famous literary visitors whose lives partially intersected, most notably Harold Acton and Norman Douglas.As I am planning a visit to Capri in the foreseeable future, I was pleasantly surprised how much information about the island and its history is conveyed in the book's 149 pages. Everything but the Blue Grotto was there. I was particularly delighted to see a photo of the villa that figured so largely in one of my favorite films, Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963): it was built by the Fascist -- later Communist -- writer Curzio Malaparte.Many of my favorite books point the way to interesting new authors, works, and places. GREENE ON CAPRI is a keeper, and I expect it will help inform my future reading and (hopefully) travel for some time to come. Shirley Hazzard is a delightful writer, and Greene a fascinating if prickly subject. The result: a literary gem which merits my highest recommendation.

Leonardo Sciascia's TO EACH IS OWN is a postmodern mystery in which the quest is everything and the solution is nowhere to be found. As W. S. di Piero writes in his excellent introduction to this edition, "Each [of Sciascia's major novels] is a genre piece, a detective story, but of an odd kind: when all clues are gathered and aligned, they lead to a wrong solution; or the mystery proves insoluble because practically everyone involved, except the investigator, is duplicitous."The setting is a Sicily in which the threat of death from organized crime is omnipresent. A local pharmacist named Manno receives an anonymous death threat and laughs it off: He was never involved in politics or philandering, so why should anyone want to kill him? The next day, he goes hunting with his good friend Dr Roscio. Neither of them returns alive.Enter the unlikely investigator: Professor Laurana, middle-aged virgin, a high-school literature teacher who lives with his mother. He begins a series of investigations that seem to wind up in dead ends at every turn. Most of his queries involve Dr Roscio's powerful uncle and the young, very attractive widow. Without coming to any decisive conclusion, Laurana's investigation itself is decisively concluded, whereupon the last few chapters provide an amusingly ironic coda to the action.At the beginning of Chapter 7, Sciascia provides a concise statement of his method:"The corollary of all the detective novels to which a goodly share of mankind repairs for refreshment specifies that a crime present its investigators with a picture, the material and, so to speak, stylistic elements of which, if meticulously assembled and analyzed, permit a sure solution. In actuality, however, the situation is different. The coefficients of impunity and error are high not because, or not only and not always because, the investigators are men of small intelligence but because the clues a crime offers are usually utterly inadequate. A crime, that is to say, which is planned or committed by people who have every interest in working to keep the impunity coefficient high."This is just one of many excellent recent offerings of New York Review Books (NYRB). Like others in the series, it is nicely edited and translated and with an excellent introduction. I look forward to reading the other Sciascia titles under the NYRB imprint.

Isn't the title of the book a dead giveaway? Whether or not the author selected it himself or it was tagged on at the publisher's request, the title should tell you that this is NOT a serious scholarly work. At the same time, it is apparent that Anthony Blond knows his subject matter well: He just wanted to have some fun. I picked up this book to read for fun and actually learned quite a bit I didn't already know from Michael Grant, Tacitus, or Suetonius.The first chapter is about sex. That's another giveaway for the Hengist & Horsa crowd (q.v. Lewis Carroll) that tried to savage this book in their reviews. And it covers only the most interesting emperors. Oh, I suppose he could have gone on with chapters on Galba, Otho, and Vitellius -- but, after all, they didn't last long enough to make an impression, did they?This is a good starting point for someone who wants a quick survey of the subject without getting lost in the footnotes. Blond mentions some interesting secondary sources along the way, and has even interested me in seeking out Josephus, Martial and Juvenal. His send-up of Cicero as a corrupt slumlord was a new one on me: I guess I better read some of those letters to Atticus.You don't have to be dull to write about Roman history. Anthony Blond does a creditable job here and makes me want to read more of his work.

THE PRIME MINISTER is in many ways the story of two marriages. At the pinnacle of the social spectrum is Plantagenet Palliser, the Duke of Omnium, who has been asked to form a coalition government and becomes Prime Minister of Her Majesty's Government. Married to the ambitious Lady Glencora, now Duchess of Omnium, Planty finds himself to be too thin-skinned to deal with the criticism that inevitably follows when one is at the top. Also, he is not really a people person: the glittering social life that his wife seeks leaves him cold.At the middle end of the social spectrum is an unknown, a handsome, ambitious young man thought to be wealthy who marries into money when he ties the knot with Emily Wharton. Unfortunately, Ferdinand Lopez is not wealthy, and is, in effect, a gambler with his own and other people's money. Emily's father never quite accepts Lopez because "he is not one of us," but is more or less shamed into acquiescence by his daughter. When he refuses to hand over a large marriage portion to his daughter, Lopez begins to unwind and sink under his debts.This is the fifth of the six Palliser series of novels in which Anthony Trollope examines the political life of England at the parliamentary, cabinet, and ministerial levels while introducing numerous characters who criss-cross this series and enter as well into some other of his novels.The real strength of the series is the relationship between the Pallisers themselves. Planty is a bit of a stick-in-the-mud, but straight as an arrow and revered by his fellow party members. Glencora is bright, witty, and ambitious where Planty is dull, taciturn, and plodding. Yet their relationship somehow works.Emily Lopez n&eacute;e Wharton is a little difficult for most modern readers to stomach. She is the ideal of the long-suffering Victorian wife who follows her unloving husband through to the very end, denying herself an iota of pleasure and fulfilment in the process. At the same time, one must realize that Trollope wrote this some century and a half ago when the prevailing morality of the time demanded that sort of irritating passivity in a wife.It is best to read the Palliser novels in sequence, beginning with CAN YOU FORGIVE HER? and proceding on to PHINEAS FINN, THE EUSTACE DIAMONDS, PHINEAS REDUX, THE PRIME MINISTER, and finally THE DUKE'S CHILDREN. While not quite Proust, the 4,000+ pages of the series will take a while to complete, but are well worth the effort.

Most fantasies follow fairly strict conventions: They tend to either adopt or adapt one of the existing congeries of folklore such as Camelot, Middle Earth, the Brothers Grimm, Star Trek, and so on. There are very few free-form practitioners of the art who take you down entirely different paths &quot;where no man has gone before.&quot; Off hand, I can think of only three: the late John Cowper Powys, Olaf Stapledon, and Edgar Allan Poe.Reading THE HISTORY, I felt I was in the world of Poe's NARRATIVE OF A. GORDON PYM: There was a sense that anything could happen. The giant wave that inundates the world not only destroys but seems to modify the nature of reality. Solid land could suddenly turn squishy. Strange monsters from the sea, called Gugs, prey on man. A lemur becomes a man and creates a disfunctional anti-human society. Ships without sails or oars sail against the current, because that is where &quot;they&quot; want to go. Then there is the matter of the horror in the yellow Volkswagen.Klein is obviously a bibliophile. The only things that stem the irreality are -- books! When the narrator, Paul Sant, stumbles upon a library, the tide begins to turn against the squishiness. In the first part of history, the one tower of sanity is Hiram Bell, who holds tight onto one book, Stoddard's STEAM ENGINES, and manages to create an island of reality.As I finished the last pages of this book, I can only express the hope that Klein continues writing. He is a real original, and he has something to say that needs saying in our present world of increasing squishiness.

Boarding the Orient Express to Istanbul are the Jewish merchant Myatt; a busybody Lesbian yellow-journalist named Mabel Warren; a mysterious doctor who calls himself Richard John, but who is actually the Serbian socialist agitator Czinner; Mrs Warren's soon to be ex-protege Janet Pardoe; and a penniless chorus girl named Coral Musker.It all sounds like an Agatha Christie novel -- but Greene had different fish to fry. Just when the story seems to take on a Dame Christie neatness, it all comes unravelled at the little border town of Subotica. Musker, who had found in Myatt a potential sugar daddy, tries to invite the Doctor to a celebration, but is whisked away as an accomplice to Czinner. Myatt at first searches for Coral, but is drawn to Janet Pardoe's greater classiness. And Mabel Warren, who had left the train at Vienna, suddenly shows up in Subotica to claim Coral Musker for her own.There are a few other characters, such as Josef Grunlich the Austrian thief; but my favorite is the purser at Ostend who cries out to Coral Musker, &quot;Remember me!&quot; even as he begins to forget her features.We are not dealing with a deep work like Greene's later, more serious efforts. Instead of a Shakespearean tragedy, we have on our hands instead a tragicomedy like ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL or MEASURE FOR MEASURE. Dr Czinner is executed, and everybody else seems to change partners as if it were a game of Musical Chairs.Graham Greene says it all when he quotes George Santayana in STAMBOUL TRAIN's epigraph: &quot;Everything in nature is lyrical in its ideal essence; tragic in its fate and comic in its existence.&quot;

The scent of garlic permeates this book, to such an extent that it becomes quite visceral and at times -- amazing for such a bulbhead as myself -- even nauseating. Both time and space are fragmented by the writer as he weaves back and forth among his stories of garlic farmers pitted against local corruption and their own at times cruel family traditions.The central event in the book is an invasion and trashing by an angry mob of the local governmental offices. We do not see this event occur until the end of the book, yet it colors every moment in the lives of the Fang and Gao families of Paradise County. It is understandable that the Beijing government would suppress a novel that shows most of its local officials to be bloated satraps and its policement to be little better than thugs, applying cattle prods to their prisoners and beating them mercilessly.Equally villainous, however, are the Fang family, who force their daughter to marry an old man in a three-in-one arranged marriage that guarantees that their crippled eldest son also gets a bride. In a grisly scene, the marriage deal finally goes through after both the daughter and her fiance commit suicide: Their bodies are dug up, their remains are mixed together, and they are re-interred in a single coffin.This is not a pleasant book to read: It takes a strong stomach, especially in the prison episodes. At the same time, it is, I feel, an important book that is beautifully written.

I have just finished reading this book a second time after 20 years. As before, I was again exhilarated by Scherman's broad brush strokes taking in the land, its history, literature, geology, flora and fauna.Particularly well done are the chapter about NJALS SAGA, the greatest of the medieval family sagas. Yet I was also interested to find an excellent discussion of the EYRBYGGJA SAGA, which I have just finished reading. The first few chapters about the volcanic origin of the land, with the massive 1973 explosion of Eldfell on Heimaey and the recent birth of the nearby isle of Surtsey. Scherman is at her best in describing the feel of the land, such as the flood sands bordering Vatnajokull.It is worth the trouble to find this superb book if you, like me, are planning to visit the land of fire and ice.

Books about pain can be excruciating to read, and this is one of them. It is fragmentary, brutally honest, and as direct as an uppercut to the jaw.Other works in the same genre include Montaigne's long essay "Of Experience" and Tolstoy's novelette THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH. Somehow we would all like to think that we will escape pain and die softly like a snowflake evaporating in pure air. If we were all Zen masters, we could die like the sages in Yoel Hoffmann's brilliant collection, JAPANESE DEATH POEMS:Inhale, exhaleForward, backLiving, dying:Arrows, let flown each to eachMeet midway and sliceThe void in aimless flight --Thus I return to the source.-- Gesshu Soko (d. 1696)Though not well known to English-speaking readers, Alphone Daudet was considered one of the greatest French novelists of the late 19th century. A full forty years before his death, he contracted syphilis around the age of 17. Around the age of 40, Daudet's illness reached the tertiary stage; and he was bedeviled by a symphony of pain that attacked his various organs, sometimes with brief remissions before new and more awful symptoms appeared.It is ironical that, were he alive today, Daudet would be cured by antibiotics; and Montaigne's kidney stones, possibly by medications, possibly by a routine surgery.British novelist Julian Barnes edited this collection of fragments. It takes only a couple of hours to read, but I guarantee that this book will leave echoes in your mind about the battles you yourself may face as you reach the endgame.

This is one of a handful of films I consider one of the most moving ever made. Director Yasujiro Ozu has created a symphony of the emotions regarding the relationship between a father (played by Chishu Ryu) and his daughter (the great Setsuko Hara).There is a Zen-like quality to this and Ozu's other great films -- including TOKYO STORY (1953). At salient points in the action, the camera leaves the characters and focuses upon the middle distance, with sad orchestral music welling up. I am told that this technique is an example of &quot;mono no aware,&quot; or sympathetic sadness. Ozu does not hammer at the viewer: He knows when to pull back and let the feelings take root and start to spiral up your spine. It is an instinctive talent that few filmmakers have.Ozu almost NEVER moves his camera, which he sets up on a short tripod about 3 feet high -- just about the height of your head if you were sitting on a tatami mat and interacting with the characters.I saw a recent documentary about Ozu in which almost everyone who ever worked with this quiet genius broke into tears. The last shot was simply of his funeral monument, with the same sad music welling up.Ozu was one of a kind. We shall not look upon his like again.

The full title of this book is THE LORDS OF THE ISLES: THE CLAN DONALD AND THE EARLY KINGDOM OF THE SCOTS. At first glance, it is far more than its title indicates. It covers a thousand years of history in the Hebrides and the adjoining parts of Western Scotland, first under the Celtic Kingdom of Dalriada beginning around 500 AD; secondly under Viking and mixed-blood Viking/Celtic kingships from around 800-1250 AD; finally under the Lordship of the Isles centered at Loch Finlaggan in Islay until the forfeiture of the Lordship around 1500 AD.For one who, like me, is enthralled by Scottish history, this is a page-turner of the first order. I first became interested in the Lords of the Isles from reading Nigel Tranter's historical novels; then, I visited the Isles myself in 1999. Now, after having read this book, I feel energized enough to return to Scotland and become even more informed thanks to this excellent history on a subject about which little is known.One particularly excellent aspect of Williams's book is its detailed coverage of parallel events in Ireland, Norway, and England which affected the Isles. We see such heroic figures as St Columba of Iona, Aedan the Fair-Haired of Dalriada, Brian Boru, Somerled MacGillibride, Angus Og (friend and chief support of Robert the Bruce), and warlord Donald Balloch.This reprint edition is published by House of Lochar located on the Isle of Colonsay in the Hebrides. It's worth taking some pains to lay hands on this book.

Toward the end of his fascinating history of the Punic Wars, author Adrian Goldsworthy speculates that one of the reasons for Carthage's fall is that the African empire was too exclusively mercantile in its mindset. Somehow, the notion that they could grow their empire through a consistent plan of conquest never quite took root in their minds. Carthage could boast one of the greatest generals in all of history in Hannibal Barca; yet they let his campaign in Italy fizzle from lack of follow-through.If Carthage represented a failure of the imagination, Rome always seemed to have their eyes on the prize. Even after Trebia, Lake Trasimene, and the slaughter at Cannae, Rome simply refused to treat with Hannibal. Moreover, they did not make the mistake of limiting their focus to Italy alone: They continued to fight in Spain, Cisalpine Gaul, and even Illyria and Greece. Once they had developed a powerful general in Scipio Africanus, they successfully invaded the Carthaginian mainland while Hannibal was bottled up in the toe of Italy.Hannibal could destroy Rome's armies in the fields, but he was never strong enough to take Rome itself. Under the intelligent, if at times arthritic, generalship of Fabius Cunctator, Rome managed to avoid fighting pitched battles with Hannibal's army for over 12 years while at the same time keeping him bottled up away from the vicinity of Rome. More seriously, Hannibal failed to persuade any major Italian cities -- with the sole exception of Capua -- to throw in their lot with Carthage. From the outset, his battle plan was to live off the land; but to defeat Rome, he also had to woo the land to his side.It is a great pity that there exist no histories of the wars from the Carthaginian side. Polybius and Livy produced very readable pro-Roman histories. It is somewhat ironic that the Phoenicians invented our alphabet, but their great colony at Carthage seemed to be averse to using it.Goldsworthy did a good job of marshalling his sources in the endnotes, yet keeping scholarly "intrusions" into the text at a minimum. My only complaint is that the maps in my Cassell hardbound edition are poorly drawn, riddled with errors, and insufficient. It would have been useful, for instance, to have maps of the territories that Hannibal controlled at different times. Many cities mentioned in the text appear on none of the maps. Also, it would have been useful to do a better job of distinguishing all the Hamilcars, Hannibals, Gisgos, Hannos, Magos, and Hasdrubals from one another. Look at the index, and see what I mean.If you like this book, I recommend that you read the two great historical novels written about the period: Gustave Flaubert's Salammbo and Winifred Bryher's The Coin of Carthage.

At a recent academic symposium about Viking culture, one member of the audience asked, "Why didn't the Icelanders protect their settlements in Greenland with police or the military?" From his point of view, it was a reasonable question -- except that he had missed the point completely about why Iceland, especially during its golden age from AD 870 through 1260, was a truly unique society.Professor Byock in his excellent VIKING AGE ICELAND zeroes in on this period and answers the question why this society was like no other. Where mainland European societies were all ruled either by large or petty despots or by the Church, Iceland was governed more or less by the consent of the governed. There was some slavery, and people on the edges of society fared no better (or worse) than anywhere else -- but your average Icelandic freeman and even women had some protection from the rich and powerful.Until its submission to Norway in 1260, Iceland was a country without an executive, without an army, without a navy. Instead, grievances were addressed by seeking powerful allies whose self-interest in the issue could result in some gain for them. If a neighbor or even a chieftain encroached on your property, you could bribe another chieftain to become involved on your side. You may lose some property, but keep the most part intact for your heirs. (On the continent, your life AND property would both be forfeit.) Chieftains had no clearly defined territory, but only adherents -- and adherents could at any time align with competing chieftains at any time. Any disputes that showed signs of getting out of hand were ultimately resolved at the althing, an annual meeting of the chieftains and their adherents at Thingvellir in the southwest of Iceland.Byock takes the sagas as his principal source and carefully shows how conflicts were resolved in such a way that life and property were protected. That is not to say that bloody, long-lasting feuds did not erupt -- but the damage was limited by the intercession of chieftains so that the feud would not divide society at large. As Njal Thorgeirsson says in NJALS SAGA: "With laws must our land be built, or with lawlessness laid waste."Some of the features of Icelandic society are difficult for us hieratic Europeans and Americans to comprehend. Byock provides detailed and lavishly illustrated examples to make his points clearly and convincingly. Indeed, in few historical works that I have ever seen has there been such superb illustrative maps and charts. Additional support is provided by comprehensive notes, bibliography, appendices, and index. This is at the same time a scholarly and an eminently readable work -- and by far the best study of Icelandic society to date.

The story of the discovery of Jules Verne's novel PARIS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is the stuff of fantasy: The 1863 unpublished manuscript was discovered lying in a safe some 130 years later.It tells the tale of one Michel Dufrenoy, winner of a prize in poetry at a time when poetry, indeed literature, means nothing. Thousands of books are still published, but they are all engineering and scientific works with sesquipedalian titles. The real hero, however, is the city of Paris circa 1960: a city of engineering marvels with such devices as elevators, fax machines, underground trains, and gas-powered cabs. (Curiously, this future world also contains quill pens and giant accounting ledger books with scaffolding.)Verne's vision of the future is endlessly fascinating, especially as so many of his predictions have come true. Where the young Verne faltered, however, is his failure to display the rambunctious 19th century optimism of his later works. Instead of a triumphant tone, we have a world in which the individual who refuses to be a cog in the great works of society becomes marginalized and ultimately crushed. PARIS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is a young writer's experiment that was rejected by publishers of the day, ostensibly because its vision was too far-fetched (it isn't), but oddly not because it was pervaded with a feeling of doom (which it certainly is).The book makes interesting reading for its insights, but fails as a story. The hero and his struggling friends are sadly short-changed.

Another coffee table paperweight? Not by a long shot! I am planning a trip to Iceland and have been reading fairly intensively in the subject. When I began reading this book, I did not expect to learn much. What a pleasant surprise! I spent a whole Sunday poring through it and was surprised at how excellent the text is -- and how well Jon Kracauer's superb photographs supplements it.David Roberts digs deep into the sagas, quoting from such relatively abstruse sources as GIMLI'S SAGA, GRETTIR'S SAGA, and BARD'S SAGA. The helpful bibliography lists a number of works I never knew existed, including a book by Sir Richard Francis Burton, the African explorer, about a summer he spent in Iceland as well as a number of rare travel books written by Europeans going back as far as the 18th century. One thing unique about this book is that Roberts and Kracauer visit many out-of-the-way places mentioned in the sagas, such as the almost inaccessible Isle of Drangey, where Grettir the Strong met his death.If you hope to visit Iceland, get this book first. It will give you not only an excellent background in the sagas but an awe for this isolated land that is so close and yet so far.

Overall, Schickel's short monograph on Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a nice piece of work. The information on Wilder's collaboration with the somewhat difficult Raymond Chandler is particularly well researched and well presented. Wilder is, after all, a writer's director, the way that John Ford is a director's director or Sergei Eisenstein, an editor's director. When film critic Andrew Sarris downgraded Wilder in his book THE AMERICAN CINEMA, it is because he could not understand that a director can be an artist while lacking a distinctive visual style. If Wilder's art comes out primarily during the scripting phase of the process, the resulting film can be just as successful -- especially if you have a great veteran like John B. Seitz behind the camera.And there is no doubt that DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a masterpiece. It is a complex work bringing together Billy Wilder's bemused street smarts, James M. Cain's corrosive venom, and Raymond Chandler's poetic noir dialogue.My only complaint with this monograph is that Schickel spent very little time on Cain's original novel except to pan it in passing. Granted that Chandler and Wilder improved on the original, the original is still one of the classic noir novels and deserves more than a passing nod.Secondly, Schickel just mentions in passing an article on screenwriting written by Chandler and doesn't even bother footnoting it. I finally tracked down the article in the second volume of the outstanding Library of America set of Chandler's work (which, by the by, also includes the complete film script for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). Chandler was obviously very down on screenwriting. Like many writers, he assumed that the script was THE key element of the film, and that writers should be treated with greater deference. After reading it, I still think the world of Chandler, but I feel all the more respect for Wilder for how he handled his somewhat cranky associate.

Much of my nonfiction reading over the last few years reflects an attempt to understand what is happening in the Middle East. Not only does the region seem to monopolize the headlines -- what with Iraq, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Palestine, and Israel -- but it also seems to be influencing a hardening of positions taken by Americans. (For instance, there is a recent quote from Pat Robertson describing Islam as a violent religion that wants to "dominate and then, if need be, destroy.")I have just finished reading a superb book by Reza Aslan entitled NO GOD BUT GOD: THE ORIGINS, EVOLUTION, AND FUTURE OF ISLAM. Born in Iran, Aslan takes the position that what is happening is less a "war between civilizations" as an internal struggle within Islam, in effect a reformation. "I use reformation deliberately," he writes, "not only to emphasize that the violence and bloodshed we are witnessing in large parts of the Islamic world are chiefly the result of an internal struggle between Muslims (rather than of a war between Islam and the West), but also to stress that the current conflicts within Islam are those with which all great religions grapple as they face the challenge of modernity."If you were to sit down today and start reading the Quran, I would venture to say that you would not find much in it to dispute. There is, for example, nothing in it to indicate that women be veiled or that they have fewer rights than men. Also, there is nothing in it that attacks either Christianity or Judaism. All that came later in various hadiths, or commentaries, that subsequent Muslims proposed and accepted. Lacking a centralized body of dogma such as the Catholic Church, and lacking a clearly defined hierarchical priesthood, Islam developed into numerous local variants that co-exist today."Islam has had a long commitment to religious pluralism," writes Aslan. "Muhammad's recognition of Jews and Christians as protected peoples (dhimmi), his belief in a common divine text from which all revealed scriptures are derived (the Umm al-Kitab), and his dream of establishing a single, united Ummah [community] encompassing all three faiths of Abraham were startlingly revolutionary ideas in an era when religion literally created borders between peoples."The problem we are facing today is the result of a fateful coincidence. What is now Saudi Arabia turned in the 18th century toward the ultra-puritanical Wahhabi sect and, as guardian of the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina, tried to push their radical belief system on the visiting pilgrims. Then, with the riches that poured into the country from the exploitation of its vast oil deposits, Saudi Arabia has become the source of missionaries into the rest of the Islamic world. In the non-Islamic world, they are putting up mosques in cities like Los Angeles which have a large Muslim population.Note that 15 of the 19 airline hijackers on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. However much the Saudi monarchy tries to maintain its friendship and lucrative ties with the United States, there are Wahhabi radicals (who are akin to and allied to the Taliban) who want to take charge of Islam. We are only at the beginnings of a process that will last well behind our lifetimes.

This is a scholarly life of Francois I, a king about whom Americans know little or nothing, but one that was instrumental in introducing the idea of the grandeur of the French monarchy. Francois lived life to the fullest: he invaded Italy multiple times (was even captured and held for ransom once), married twice, had mistresses everywhere, built palaces and castles all over France -- including Fontainebleau and many of the most famous chateaux of the Loire.Therefore, it is a little unfortunate that his biographer had so little of that life rub off on him. This is Knecht's second stab at Francois's life, so one would think he could step back a little and marvel at what this truly remarkable man accomplished in his lifetime. After all, he brought Leonardo Da Vinci up to live with him at Amboise and allowed one of the books of Rabelais' PANTAGRUEL to be dedicated to him. Yet Rabelais and Da Vinci are brought into the book only in passing.Both Henry VIII and the Emperor Charles V were somewhat cowed by this monarch, whose left hand held a sword and right hand, an olive branch.This is probably a silly thing to mention, but I feel I would recognize Francois if he were alive today. Most illustrations of Medieval or Renaissance princes are more or less interchangeable: Charles the Bold, Richard III, Philip II of Spain. The portraits of Francois make him look like a real person, as if he actually had some control about how he was depicted. A little of his personality comes through in this book, such as in his dealings with artist Benvenuto Cellini -- but what a personality!Knecht may not be a great biographer like Duff Cooper (Talleyrand) or Richard Holmes (Coleridge), but he did succeed in bringing something of the essence of this great king across.

For sheer dripping tropical lushness of prose that at the same time is watertight and flowing, nothing can beat Chatwin's VICEROY OF OUIDAH. I have long admired the author's essays, and this is only my second (and far from last) foray into his fiction. Picture to yourself a story in two parts, each occupying roughly half the book. The first is a gathering of Francisco da Silva's descendents years after his death; the second follows his life from its humble beginnings in Brazil to his glory days as a much-loved and much-hated slave-trader and finally ending in his slow undoing in the vortex of passions, jealousies, and greed in the West African society in which he lives.That same society was described by another great writer almost a century earlier. Sir Richard Francis Burton's A MISSION TO GELELE, KING OF DAHOMEY captures the scene perfectly some 50 years or so after da Silva's passing, including the all-female army regiments of the King and the weird dysfunctionality of his court. Chatwin seems to have taken a few leaves from Burton's book and woven a fascinating study of the rise and fall of a very limited man.We never really see into da Silva's mind: In the first part of the book, he is merely a revered forefather; in the second, an adventurer whose decline is as precipitate as Citizen Kane's. The King's Amazon warriors howl at his passing: &quot;It was not the leopard that killed him. Not the buffalo that killed him. It was night. Night that killed him.&quot; That -- and everything else.At no time does da Silva understand the irony of his being a slave broker whom the slaving ship captains could trust. We do not follow the slavers to the New World, just see them off at the docks as they begin their grim voyage. The Dahomean kings use da Silva, but profoundly distrust him. When he no longer serves their purpose, they and the whole society in which he lives drive him to the final extremity.There is one link between the life of da Silva and the celebrations of his descendents: The character of Mama Wewe. We see her only at the end of both parts, yet she unifies and justifies Chatwin's bi-partite division. Put this one on the shelf next to Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS.

The ROUGH GUIDE series has produced some wonderful books -- I am particularly fond of the titles on France and Scotland, which I have used extensively. This is their first crack at Iceland, and it is a commendable, if not outstanding, effort.As a result of a recent 15-day trip to Iceland, I can say that it is mostly reliable but far from exhaustive. For one thing, the emphasis is on sleeping bag accommodations exclusively. (Okay, maybe I'm not quite so &quot;rough&quot; a traveler: Two weeks in the same smelly down bag is not my idea of comfortable travel.) Also, the book omits many very viable accommodation options, such as the Bolti farmhouse at Skaftafell. Also many oustanding restaurants such as the well-known Bautinn in Akureyri are unaccountably missing.What did this guide have to say about my guesthouse in Reykjavik (the excellent Baldursbra)? Only that it had &quot;rather narrow beds and unfortunate floral curtains.&quot; Good grief! Firstly, the size of single beds in Iceland tends to be quite standard: No extra inches were shaved off. Secondly, the curtains were indeed floral but not so aggressively bad as suggested by the writers of the guide, who appear to have been suffering from a bad hair day.On the plus side, the &quot;Basics&quot; and &quot;Contexts&quot; sections are both useful and entertaining introductions to travel in this most fascinating of destinations. I've always regarded a good bibliography as an asset to any guide, and this one has an excellent one. Included is a helpful summary of the key Icelandic sagas, a knowledge of which is essential to understanding the uniqueness of Iceland.You won't go far wrong with this guide, but there is room for improvement in editions to come. For now, I recommend the 2001 Edition of the Lonely Planet Guide as being the most authoritative guide.

I could not help but think while reading this novel of a Frank Capra film from the 1930s entitled YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU about an eccentric household headed by Lionel Barrymore full of amiable zanies who stump the frenetic world around them.Laxness, Iceland's only Nobelist, writes of a young orphan named Alfgrim who may or may not be a relative of the great opera singer Gardar Holm, who also hails from Brekkukot, where the old lumpfisherman Bjork maintains a rambling house on the outskirts of what was to become the country's new capital, Reykjavik. This house is filled with lodgers who get to stay rent-free for no other reason than that they ask.Alfgrim keeps crossing paths with Gardar Holm and the young woman who wants to become the singer's lover. For some reason, the singer always cancels his appointments to the chagrin of his sponsors and fans; and the young woman, Blaer Gudmunsen, is always given the slip. The unhappy Holm is in stark contrast to Alfgrim, who maintains his balance by being suspicious of fame and content with a future of gathering lumpfish.In the end, this is an feel-good work of considerable artistry, with a masterful, rich sense of characterization. The translation by Magnus Magnusson is excellent, as befits the man who at one and the same time is both one of the best translators of Icelandic Sagas and the TV host of BBC's MASTERMIND and WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYHOW?

This is quite the best of the books written in the late 19th century by British travelers who were enchanted with Patagonia. Two others, RIDING ACROSS PATAGONIA by Lady Florence Dixie and WANDERINGS IN PATAGONIA by Julius Beerbohm, have recently been reprinted and both bear reading. Musters was the first to publish (in 1871), and was referred to very amusingly by Lady Florence in her book when she described the reaction of her friends to her expedition:"Patagonia! Who would ever think about going to such a place? Why you will be eaten up by cannibals! What on earth makes you choose such an outlandish part of the world to go to? What can be the attraction? Why it is thousands of miles away, and no one has ever been there before, except Captain Musters, and one or two other adventurous madmen!"Thank heaven for adventurous madmen like Captain Musters! Although he was by training a military man, he was able to blend in with the Tehuelche Indians of Patagonia and travel with them for months between Santa Cruz at the mouth of the Rio Chico and the relatively young settlement at Patagones, now known as the twin cities of Carmen de Patagones and Viedma.To be flexible enough to be accepted by a native tribe and act, in effect, as a sub-chief in their dealings with the Araucanian and Pampas tribes and still retaining their respect at the end is a tribute to a remarkable personality. Like Charles Darwin in his VOYAGE OF THE HMS BEAGLE, Musters was a meticulous and mostly reliable observer. His book contains two appendices, one a glossary of terms and expressions in the Tehuelche tongue, and the other an amusing comparison of the myths discussing whether the Patagonian Indians were giants (they were taller than most Indians, but not giants).Musters traveled some distance with his Tehuelche hosts, much of it along the eastern edge of the Andes, the land now traversed by the famous Ruta 40. During his travels, the characters of the individual men, women, and children in the tribes were skillfully delineated, as well as their customs and frequent quarrels.By 1871, the Tehuelche were well on their way to extinction. Musters estimated that there were only 1,500 members of the several nomadic bands. Disease, drink, and feuds all played a part in decimating their population. During one alarming stretch between Geylum and the Coast, the tribe had to pass through an area with such bad water and poor hunting that the children began to die off at an alarming rate.This is an outstanding work that is readable and scholarly at the same time. I give it my highest recommendation.

Having read and enjoyed THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD BEYOND THE WAVE, I decided to look into R. E. Klein's other novel, THE WAY TO MT. LOWE. What I found was a charming history of Southern California from the 1890s through the 1950s seen from the point of view of one Lyman Bright.A native of Indiana, Bright moves to Los Angeles with his family in 1892. As a 10-year-old, he was astounded by a new trolley line ascending thousands of feet to Mount Lowe, where there were hotels, restaurants, and other tourist amenities -- not to mention a phenomenal view in those pre-smog days extending south and west toward the Pacific and offshore to Santa Catalina Island.Bright, his family, and friends exemplify the boom days and bust days of L.A. After the Mt. Lowe project ended in bankruptcy, Bright's attention was drawn by the canals of Venice, a community developed by Abbot Kinney, after whom a street in present-day Venice has been named.Although I have not climbed Mt. Lowe myself -- though I could tell that Mr. Klein has -- I have frequently walked along what remains of those same Venice canals, now being re-gentrified after decades of neglect. As a native of Southern California, Klein saw it all, registers all the joys and disappointments, only to come to this summary of the whole experience in the last chapter: "A flawless record of stupendous achievements ending in extinction."As Lyman ages and the chapters toward the end of the book get shorter and shorter, he takes to the famous Red Cars that once connected the outlying towns of the Los Angeles area, only to be killed off by the automobile. He aimlessly travels from place to place, soaking in what's left of what he loved.If you do not know or care much about Los Angeles, this book will probably not do much for you. You will lack the frame of reference required to see where everything takes place. (There is, however, a handy map on the back of the paperback edition.)But if you know and love Los Angeles as I do, having lived here for over 40 years myself, it is easy to be swept away by author's enthusiasm. His characters are lightly sketched in, but then the main character is Los Angeles itself, especially in its moments of glory represented by Mt. Lowe, Venice, and the Red cars. Lyman and his friends represent the city in its spectacular growth and, at times, disappointing deterioration.

We are so used to thinking of China as a single Han culture that we forget the existence of other cultures, such as the Tibetans (Xizang), Diao, Miao, and Hani -- not to mention the Islamic peoples of the far west. When I read SOUL MOUNTAIN, I received my first education in the subject.Now I have received quite by chance this children's book from University of Hawaii Press. Upon looking at it, I was drawn in by the excellent illustrations and started reading. I can't speak for what a child would think (and I don't have one to act as a guinea pig), but I loved it.The book consists of four folk tales, each from a minority culture. After each tale is a description of how it has given birth to a festival, and how that festival is celebrated today. In a society such as ours which has so little understanding of other cultures, this would be a particularly painless way of introducing children to a wider, more colorful, and fascinating world. My congratulations to Carolyn and Jay Han and the excellent illustrator Li Ji.

Long after I've forgotten mysteries based on ornate plots, I still remember the ones based on interesting characters -- and this one by Valerie Wilson Wesley is a pip! In addition to Tamara Haynes' hard-working private investigator, we have a wealthy and philandering street boy made good (Lincoln Storey) and a whole fascinating crew of people who stood to gain from his death under suspicious circumstances: his smooth but untrustworthy wife Daphne; her daughter Alexa from another marriage; Alexa's friend Tasha (who is arrested for murdering him); the restaurateur Tate -- an old family friend of Tamara's; aspiring politician and attorney Stella Pharr; and Brandon Pike, who is squiring Daphne and Alexa around a couple of years after having broken up with Tamara.Incidentally, the murder weapon is -- peanut butter. Someone laced Storey's bean dip; and Storey was notorious for his allergy to peanuts.So kick off your shoes, relax, and let Tamara show you what happened.

Gerald Durrell will make you roar with laughter even in a whispering land. The fact that this book is still in print after half a century gives you some idea that it is still quite readable: In fact, it reads as if it were written yesterday.I devoured this book as part of a reading program I planned for myself for a trip to Patagonia. The first half of the book is set in two areas in Patagonia that I planned to visit: Puerto Deseado in the south, once visited by Darwin on his circumnavigation of the earth on the Beagle, and the large wildlife preserve at Peninsula Valdez, near Puerto Madryn. There, Durrell visited penguin rookeries; saw the breeding grounds of sea lions and elephant seals; and saw guanacos, Geoffroy's cats, rheas, and tinamous.From Patagonia, Durrell went to the area around Jujuy in the tropical northwest of Argentina. There, he went into collecting mode as he employed locals to track down wild animals that were being kept as pets by the indigenous population.Durrell's encounters with the local people are funny and at times heart-wrenching, as when he finds a self-taught naturalist named Coco who must work at a sawmill to make ends meet. But Durrell's encounters with animals are utterly hilarious, as his attempts to tame a captured Geoffroy's cat (gato montes).One of the best chapters relates to the difficulties that Durrell has in exporting his animals and getting all his bureaucratic ducks in a row. His final departure on a ship bound to Europe is held up until a last minute solution satisfies a particularly mule-headed customs official.I enjoyed this book so much that I plan to read several more of Durrell's works soon. It is hard to believe that the author is the brother of novelist Lawrence Durrell, author of THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET.

I work for some very wealthy people who travel frequently. They always buy a package tour for umpteen thousands of dollars, stay at four-star hotels or on luxury cruise vessels, make no effort to read anything about the countries they're visiting because there's "not enough time," and -- other than some nice photographic trophies and a few stories about the funny things their guide said -- don't know much more about their destinations after the trip than before.In his other books that I have read -- HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE and THE CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY -- Alain de Botton has succeeded to taking very complex material and distilling it down to a few home truths that are as enlightening as anything I have read on the subjects.You can imagine that I was eager to see what de Botton would do with travel, about which I know something because I love it above all other things in my life. Before going on a vacation, I start a six-month reading program encompassing guidebooks, histories, biographies, and the literature of the country or countries I am visiting.When I visited Iceland in 2001, for example, I read all the major medieval Icelandic sagas, anything I could find by Nobel Prize winner Halldor Laxness, histories, travel books by W. H. Auden, Lord Dufferin (19th century Governor General of Canada), and others. That would place me in the category of J. K. Huysmans's hero Des Esseintes -- with one major difference: I also took the journey and enjoyed it. I am doing the same prep now for an upcoming visit to Patagonia.People travel for many reasons, but they sometimes forget that travel will not necessarily open their minds and hearts to anything. There is an old 1960s saying: "Wherever you go, there you are." De Botton exposes our motives and shows that, in effect, the way to enjoy travel the most is to be prepared for and open to change, to in effect change the "you" that is travelling.Both Pascal and Dostoyevsky have noted that man is unhappy largely because he does not know how to stay quietly in his own room. If so, man will be no happier under a palm tree in Bora Bora.There is one scene in the first chapter, "On Anticipation," that summarizes it all for me. De Botton and his travelling companion get into a spat over who gets which portion of dessert. Despite the idyllic setting in Barbados, the day is spoiled for both of them:"There is a contrast between the vast projects we set in motion, the construction of hotels and the dredging of bays, and the basic psychological knots that undermine them, How quickly may the advantages of civilisation be wiped out by a tantrum. The intractibility of the mental knots points to the austere, wry wisdom of those ancient philosophers who walked away from prosperity and sophistication and argued, from within a barrel or a mud hut, that the key ingredients of happiness could not be material or aesthetic but most always be stubbornly psychological..."And there we get to the rub: This is a book about how travel can make you happy -- if you're ready for it!

I've gone over much of the original literature that Shipton's TIERRA DEL FUEGO was based on, and still found it to be an interesting and informative read. For one thing, he sandwiches the history portion neatly between two expeditions he himself took, on one hand climbing a mountain on the Chilean side of the Tierra del Fuego island, and on the other investigating avenues of approach to Mount Burney along obscure channels from Skyring Water northwest of Punta Arenas.The majority of the book deals with the voyages of exploration by Ferdinand Magellan; Sir Francis Drake; Pedro Sarmiento; and the HMS Beagle under Stokes and Fitzroy, with the help of Lieutenant Skyring. With the Beagle and its encounter with the Yahgan (Yamana) Indians of Tierra del Fuego, the emphasis switches to the attempts by missionaries to settle the area, culminating with the successes of Thomas and Lucas Bridges.My only negative comment is that the book required more detailed maps, especially to describe the many journeys of the Beagle through the area. This is the publisher's problem, but one that should be considered if this book ever comes out in a new edition, which I hope happens.Shipton is perhaps better known for his excellent mountain-climbing books; but in TIERRA DEL FUEGO: THE FATAL LODESTONE, he has written a classic one can place beside Lucas Bridges's own THE UTTERMOST PART OF THE EARTH as the two best books on this still relatively unexplored area.

The first books I ever read about the Civil War were by Bruce Catton, starting with his novel BANNERS AT SHENANDOAH and continuing with his two overall histories and ending with his U.S. Grant trilogy. There is something effortless about the way Catton integrates his sources and spins his tale.If one may say he is not really a scholar, he is at least a brilliant popularizer and integrater. REFLECTIONS is like the capstone of his career. Now that I've read scores of books on the subject, Catton somehow manages to revivify the entire period.By far my favorite chapter is the story of an Army Engineer who also created a sketchbook of his battle experiences. Catton follows him thoughout the war and even after, until his later years are spent in pain from an injury received in battle decades before. Also brilliant is is short summary of the war from the point of view of opportunities lost. (It appears that the commanding generals of the Army of the Potomac have a lot to answer for.)If you want a single book to give you a good feeling of what the Civil War was like without dragging you company by company through all the gory details, this is the book for you.There are many great writers about the Civil War, but I definitely feel that, now that Catton has gone, the vital spark is no longer there.

As I read this issue travelling from LA to New York and back, I saw there was a secret thread that held most of the pieces in it together: Ghosts of one sort or another. Henk van Woerden's excellent &quot;The Assassin&quot; is about a man who had no sense of identity, and whose attempt to find one led to the assassination of South African premier Hendrik Verwoerd in September 1966. His Demetrios Tsafendas is a man without a country, without a religion, and without the human affiliations that seem to make life worth living.Other pieces in this thread are Hanif Kureishi's arresting &quot;Goodbye, Mother&quot; about a son's inability to deal with his aging mother; Graham Swift's &quot;Our Nicky's Heart,&quot; about a boy's death in a motorcycle accident and its strange aftermath; and especially Richard Williams's haunting &quot;Gifted,&quot; about his search for jazz trumpeter Dupree Bolton, one of the best written pieces I have ever read on the subject of jazz. Also, I must add Kent Klich's sad &quot;Born in Romania,&quot; about HIV-positive Romanian children whom he photographed, many of whom died before the article went to press.I enjoyed Diana Athill's &quot;Editing Vidia,&quot; a contribution in the emerging subgenre of why V.S. Naipaul is not likeable (adding to Paul Theroux's article last year in the NEW YORKER). The question I ask is, what does that have to do with Naipaul's work? Niceness is not a trait common to all great artists, so why belabor the point?There are also short pieces by Paul Theroux and Keith Ridgway that struck me more as fillers for an otherwise excellent issue of this indispensable publication.

In the previous volume of Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, Marcel was poised at the pinnacle of social success as he readied himself to attend the Princesse de Guermantes' party. Those alabaster gates that from a distance appeared to be the entry to paradise actually opened only onto a continuing pageant of human folly. Early in the book, a chance peek out the window shows the elegant Baron de Charlus to be a pervert as he romances the servile Jupien.Even his beloved Duchesse de Guermantes "allowed the azure light of her eyes to float in front of her, but vaguely, so as to avoid the people with whom she did not wish to enter into relations, whose presence she discerned from time to time like a menacing reef in the distance."Marcel retreats from the social whirl and returns to Balbec, the scene of WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE. There he takes up again with Albertine and, after hobnobbing with the Guermantes, now joins Mme Verdurin's "little band" of opinionated second-raters. This was the same salon at which Swann had met Odette in SWANN'S WAY. You may recall that Swann discovered that Odette was multiply unfaithful to him, yet married her anyway.In SODOM AND GOMORRAH, it is Marcel who is drawn ever closer to Albertine. As the book draws to a close, he discovers from a chance remark that Albertine claims close friendship with two lesbians one of whose trysts Marcel had witnessed years before in Combray. Just as Swann had agonized just before deciding to wed Odette, Marcel sees the death of his hopes and of any chance for joy in his young life."As by an electric current that gives us a shock, I have been shaken by my loves. I have lived them. I have felt them: never have I succeeded in seeing or thinking them. Indeed I am inclined to believe that in these relationships ..., beneath the outward appearance of the woman, it is to these invisible forces with which she is incidentally accompanied that we address ourselves as to obscure deities."During this, my second reading of IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, I continue to marvel at Proust's mastery. The scene of a social gathering that occupies two hundred pages, and takes me two or three days to read, seems to pass by in the blinking of an eye.

Quick, name one famous leader or military hero associated with the thousand-year history of the Republic of Venice. (Sorry: writers and painters don't count.) Now imagine that you are writing a 600+ page history of Venice. How do you make it a page-turner without recourse to biography? Can it be done?It seems that John Julius Norwich has done it, and with flying colors. I had originally planned to read the history in small driblets, a chapter at a time to keep my interest from flagging. I was delighted to find that my interest was engaged from the very first and remained so until Napoleon Bonaparte demonstrated to the world during his Italian campaign that the Republic could be had. Before the young emperor-to-be doused the lights, Venice had had a glorious run.Here was a country that began as a naval and mercantile power. Turning its back on the Italian mainland, Venice looked to the east. Its merchants spread out through the Eastern Mediterranean and as far as the Black Sea -- and sometimes, as in the case of Marco Polo -- much farther. While mainland Italy was mired in an endless struggle between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, Venice strived to live at peace with its neighbors. For several hundred years, it even lived at peace with the Turk -- to the extent of scuttling a Crusade or two when it felt its interests were better served elsewhere. Only when the resurgent Ottomans under Mehmet II and his descendants became an effective sea power in the 15th century did Venice have to look across its moat to the Italian mainland.When the Turk cut off its colonies in the East, Venice engaged in a brief career of conquest in Northern Italy with mixed results. Much more successful was its strength at diplomacy, for which it became famous. Curiously, reading this book puts the confusing history of Italy as a whole into sharper perspective if only because seen from a stable point of view. While the papacy and the city states were pulled apart or compacted like silly putty, based on the personalities and issues du jour, Venice stood serenely above the fray. What it lost on the battlefield, it won by sharp dealing. It seemed invincible ... until Napoleon entered the scene.Norwich shows us all the pomp and pageantry, the masks and mummery, the octogenarian Doges and the Councils of 10, the Zontas, and all the intricate paraphernalia of Venetian governance. Instead of palling, the book could have gone on for another 600 pages before I ceased to be mesmerized. This is a great book, and Norwich is a great historian.

This is the ONLY version of the Alice in Wonderland stories worth having. Lewis Carroll was a remarkably allusive chap -- and a mathematician to boot -- so you need a vade mecum to guide yourself through the bulrushes. Martin Gardner serves admirably for this purpose.Without Gardner's help, I would never have known that mock turtle soup was actually made with veal (and that's why John Tenniel drew the Mock Turtle with the head, hind hoofs, and tail of a calf). And now I think I know why a raven is like a writing desk ("because it can produce a few notes, tho they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front"). Also, now I know the REAL text of the nursery rhyme "You Are Old, Father William."This is the best edition to get because -- let's face it -- you WILL read the Alice stories more than once. And very likely others in your household will do the same. The real reason, as the Cheshire Cat says: "We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."

Among film historians and critics, director Sam Fuller has a disproportionately large legend for such a small body of work. If you exclude his early screenwriting career and his self-imposed exile in Europe, he was active as a director for only 16 years, from I SHOT JESSE JAMES (1949) to THE NAKED KISS (1965). But what films those were! THE STEEL HELMET (1950) is probably one of the two or three best war films ever made; and PARK ROW (1952) is in a class by itself as a valentine to American journalism in its heyday.Hollywood autobiographies are notorious for settling old scores, and Fuller certainly had a lot of scores to settle. Coming into the business by way of writing, Fuller fought hard to keep his ideas intact through the shredding machine that was the old studio system. Film is a communal art form, and only rarely has the finished product reflected the vision of a single creator, sometimes because the filmmaker was a powerful producer/director such as Hitchcock or Ford, or sometimes, as in the case of Fuller's own SHOCK CORRIDOR (1963) or THE NAKED KISS, because no one was looking.Around the middle of the 1960s, many of the independent directors such as Fuller, Orson Welles, and Fritz Lang found themselves drawn to Europe, where they managed to eke out a very few more films that were not up to their previous work. After THE NAKED KISS, it becomes painfully apparent in the autobiography that Fuller had little else to do but write, attempt to put together funding for (mostly) aborted projects, or receive the homages of critics and other filmmakers.What makes A THIRD FACE such a good book is Fuller's passion as a journalist, soldier, and filmmaker. He never lost this passion, but to quote Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BOULEVARD, it was the movies that became small. By the mid 1960s, Hollywood was a spent force. The torch had passed to Japan (Kurosawa), France (the New Wave), Sweden (Bergman), Italy (Fellini, Visconti, and Rossellini), and points in between. There were still some great films to come, but the number of productions had decreased; television continued to grow; and Americans were torn between superspies, hippies, and blockbusters.

When I first started travelling to Europe 25 years ago, the Frommer guides were like beacons. They had a very definite goal in mind: To let you enjoy Europe for $XX dollars a day. Their books were fun and informative; but somewhere along the line, the Frommer people lost touch with their leadership.When you try to write a book for everybody, you wind up writing for nobody. Let us take accommodations as an example: They are classified as Expensive, Moderate, and Inexpensive. Now I am not on public assistance by any means, yet I can barely afford Frommer's Inexpensive accommodations, which average around more than $100 a night.There are guidebooks which are good at accommodations and restaurants but not on sights; and there are others (like the superb DK Eyewitness Guides) which concentrate on the sights. I am hard put to place Frommer on this spectrum. In the Netherlands, he downplays the Zuider Zee Museum in Enkhuizen and the Open Air Museum in Arnhem, yet spends 3 chapters on Luxembourg, including one on &quot;Planning a Trip to Luxembourg.&quot; Hello! When was the last time you got the wife and kiddies mobilized for a fun filled 3 week vacation in the tiny Duchy of Luxembourg?On the plus side, the &quot;Best of...&quot; lists are a useful counter to the general lack of emphasis in this guidebook.If you were visiting the U.S., you would want a guidebook to show you why you might want to spend more time in New York than Youngstown. Once the best of guidebook series, Frommer has been reduced to cataloguing sights. Where's the excitement? Not here.

In the crepuscular post-September 11 world I find myself in, I thought I would go and read some of the classics of travel in the Middle East back when the going was good. Byron's OXIANA looked promising, so I curled up with it for a few enchanting days.Byron was no lover of pre-packaged tourist sights. He begins by slurring Venice, where he begins his journey. Later, he slams the Taj Mahal and the Alhambra as examples of what he did NOT want to see in the Middle East. At first, I was not sure where the book was going: Byron comes across at first as one of those hypereducated upper class twits who pop in and out of Evelyn Waugh's novels. Fortunately, it turns out to be just one of the author's favorite personas he assumes from time to time.Over half a century ago, he saw clearly what would happen to Palestine when the British pulled out, namely, that the Jews and Arabs would be at each other's throats. As he reaches Iran we finally begin to see what Byron is really after: He travels from one old mosque or ruin to another. Although none of places he describes in such loving detail are known to me, it was easy to see that here was a man who wanted to be one of the first to see some marvel of architecture and capture it in photographs and in prose before the forces of time would destroy it utterly.In the process of going from place to place, he describes the Europeans and locals he meets with humor and shrewdness. The Middle East was not the easiest place to travel in the 1930s, and Byron ran into some almost insurmountable obstacles which he typically surmounts. One such is his arrival in Aghanistan's high country too late in the season. He backtracks to Persia and waits six months until he could return in the spring.I highly recommend ROAD TO OXIANA to all who wish the world was safe and innocent enough for us to pursue our own Oxianas, wherever they may be.

The first two-thirds of this book is a superb travel guide to Milan, Venice, Rome, and Campania. Barbara Grizzuti Harrison is very conversant with the best travel literature of the past (and thoughtfully provides us a useful bibliography) and -- more rare by far -- has a great deal to add as an Italian-American confronting the land of her birth.After her chapter on Naples and Campania, the book takes an entirely different tack. The author goes to visit what remains of her family in rural Molise and Calabria. Big mistake. You can't mix pleasure with unfinished family business and expect to get anything other than heartsick.I remember taking a visit to Hungary and Slovakia to visit my relatives some years ago. Their reaction: Why haven't you visited us before? Why aren't you staying longer? When are you coming back? Let us introduce you to your third and fourth cousins! It was interesting, at times even exhilarating, but it was no vacation. And you need a vacation from your vacation when you return.Although Harrison's family visits break her book in two, it conveys a sense of truth missing from most books of the sort -- especially of the nefarious Tuscan villa genre. Our ancestors left their homes for a reason. They may not tell you the reason; but those left behind nursing their grudges will gladly set you straight -- possibly to your intense discomfiture.So in the end, I have nothing but praise for this book. Especially if you are an Italian-American going back to the &quot;Old Country&quot; for a first visit, you must read this book. Like the author, take your vacation first -- then go face the music with your relatives.

In both 1998 and 1999, we travelled to Britain using Rick Steves as our primary guide. I have used other guidebooks before: Frommer, Let's Go, Rough Guides, and Lonely Planet. While I admire the detail in the latter two series, I trust Steves only in two important areas:(1) Trustworthy accommodations recommendations (he and his people really do check out the places he recommends) and(2) Useful training in the practical &quot;how to&quot; aspects of travel, such as how to phone home without using your overpriced American telephone credit card and how to take trains and other public transportation. The man is a serious educator: witness his entertaining PBS TV series. He is willing to make himself look like a dork to make you enjoy European travel.On the negative side, Steves' restaurant recommendations are sparse and uadventurous (though this is an area in which no one excels). Also, in selling the areas in which he is most interested, he leaves out large areas of the British Isles (especially in Scotland, where the omission of Glasgow and the Orkneys may take some explaining).In the rec.travel.europe newsgroup, Steves has legions of detractors and defenders. Mere mention of his name sets off knee-jerk flaming responses from people who do not understand him.The simple fact is this: If you follow his recommendations --particularly if you are relatively new to European travel -- you are likely to have a better time. Why? The man is not afraid to be prescriptive (instead of largely descriptive like Lonely Planet). Also, you are not likely to waste as much money, because you will weight your trip more on the side of small towns than large cities.

Victor Hugo never did anything by halves. His NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS begins as a tour of Gothic Paris and ends as a monumental and melodramatic Grand Guignol. Needless to say, all the film versions focus on the wrong character: Quasimodo is by no means the main focus of the novel, and the novel certainly is misnamed when called THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The hero, if there is one, is the cathedral itself, brooding over Renaissance Paris like a horror from another age.The only character who is not not overdramatized appears only once in an unforgettable vignette at the very end: Louis XI, King of France, who has been called by the historian Philippe de Commynes "The Universal Spider." Louis; his grasping barber, Olivier le Daim; and his grim hatchet man, Tristan l'Hermite are unforgettable and more sharply drawn than any other Hugo characters I can recall.John Sturrock's translation is well done except for his occasional inclusion of an archaic term without footnote or any other comment. Most notable are two items of apparel I still cannot visualize, namely bycokets and actons. Yet every Latin phrase, and there are many spoken by Pierre Gringoire and the student Jehan Frollo, is faithfully translated.Also useful would have been a map of Louis XI's Paris. I was frequently confused about where the action was taking place, because most if not all of the place names were later superseded by others.I would venture to say that no one reading this novel will ever forget it. I first read it more than twenty years ago, and it still sprang into my mind as sharply-etched as before.This edition is unabridged. Although Hugo sometimes tended to go off on tangents, I could not think of a single chapter I would axe. Even where it does not add to the plot, it adds to the atmosphere of a city in which life and love were cheap, and no infraction was ever left unpunished by the most dire means possible.

Boswell's Life of Johnson is one of those super-great books that you keeps sneaking off the shelf from time to time, opening at random, and re-sampling just to reassure yourself that there is ever so much more to life than terrorism, crime, or the workaday rut. The writing leaps out at you, and the epiphanies erupt in your mind like champagne bubbles.In my collection are several editions, my favorite being an elegant hardback printed on superthin India paper that I love to take with me on my travels.Imagine my delight to read a biography of the making of Boswell's Life. Far from a triumphal march, however, Boswell paid heavily for being the first biographer to incorporate actual conversations and comments affecting the privacy of people still living. Overnight, he found former friends crossing the street to avoid greeting him. Social to the extreme, Boswell found himself excluded from gatherings for fear that he would bring a chill to the proceedings by transcribing conversations not meant for the ears of others.And yet the Life has never once been out of print. It was a best seller from the beginning, and its reputation has only grown in the years to follow. Adam Sisman's wonderful study shows us a man who was so beset upon for writing this best-seller that his heirs refused to even discuss him for several generations. While everyone praised the book, the poor author won only obloquy for being a social ingrate who scribbled down juicy bits of conversation.Boswell immolated his whole life to bring us this book, and its companion journal of his and Dr. Johnson's travels in Scotland. Reflect well that fame can bear a heavy price, and that Boswell paid it in full.

It is appropriate that Paul Theroux, that globetrotting curmudgeon who gave us THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS and so many other great travel books, should write the introduction for this edition of Millman's LAST PLACES. Millman takes Theroux's world-weariness to higher latitudes -- from Norway across to the Shetlands and Faroes, from there to Iceland and Greenland, and ending up in Labrador.But like Theroux, Millman is wonderfully entertaining. See him witness a Faroese &quot;grindadr&aacute;p,&quot; or mass slaughter of a whole pod of whales, by throngs of gleeful Faroese bearing hooks and knives. See him wake up naked and hung over in a drainage ditch after a night of carousing in Reykjavik. And, most funny of all, see him fend off love-starved Inuit maidens in Nuuk who crave his bod and are not too dainty about their seduction technique.Millman is a bit of a loner, and yet his book sparkles most when he is interacting with the locals. Because this happens hardly at all in the Shetlands, this is the weakest part of his book. LAST PLACES picks up steam as he visits an isolated lighthouse keeper in the West Fjords of Iceland whose library extends to 16,000 volumes. His encounters with Inuits in Greenland are priceless. And the episodes in Labrador show us a land of isolated cranks and eccentrics attempting to protect their way of life from do-gooder government relocation projects.When the thermometer rises, pick up this book to cool you off. It makes for great summer reading. And it is excellent preparation for my upcoming trip to Iceland. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Nikolai Leskov is the second last of the great storytellers. (In the 20th century, we had only one more: Isaac Bashevis Singer.) What makes for a great storyteller is that he creates a literary melody out of simple, believable characters and the events that overtake and carry them to some form of resolution. There is no harmony, no literary grace notes or cadenzas -- very much like a recurring tune that one cannot get out of one's head. The appeal is to something very primitive in all of us: Before we had written language, we had stories that we could marvel at and remember during those long evenings sitting around the fire.The four stories in this volume range from the ghastly &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mzinsk District&quot; about a murderess who kills for passion to the Gogolesque &quot;The Sentry&quot; about the ideal bureaucratic solution to a military transgression. Along the way, we have &quot;The Toupee Artist,&quot; a compelling tale about the evils of serfdom seen from the point of view of a serf theatrical troupe and of the place of chance in all our lives. Finally, &quot;On the Edge of the World&quot; is about a missionary Russian Orthodox bishop who learns humility from a humble monk and a heathen Siberian sledge driver during a horrible blizzard. This last story reminds me strongly of Akira Kurosawa's film DERSU UZALA, which may have been partly based on it.The Hyperion Press Classics of Russian Literature series is a gold mine of lesser-known Russian literature. Some of their editions, like Leskov's stories and those of Ivan Goncharov and Alexei Pisemskii, are to my mind on a par with the best -- whom my mother used to call, collectively, Tolstoyevsky.

In the waning years of the 17th century there was committed an atrocity whose echoes are still reverberating. Angered by the marauding ways of the MacDonalds of Glencoe, the King (William of Orange) and his ministers -- most notably the Master of Stair -- draft orders for their murder.The Argyle regiment is sent to Glencoe and asks to be quartered with the MacDonalds. After two weeks of accepting the sacred hospitality of the highlanders, the troops wait for the signal and butcher their hosts. A wry &quot;coda&quot; describes how all the English and Scots politicos, from the King on down, tried to wriggle out of the responsibility for the massacre.Prebble's Scottish histories are unfortunately out of print now. GLENCOE, as well as CULLODEN and THE HIGHLAND CLEARANCES, are superbly written and a necessity for any tourist visiting Scotland who wants to understand the historical background.

This saga examines four generations of a redoubtable Icelandic family of warrior poets thought to be descended from trolls, beginning with Kveldulf in the first generation; Skallagrim, in the second; Egil, in the third; and finally petering out with Thorstein, who is content to be a mere farmer. They are (frequently) outlawed by the powerful kings of Norway, whom they help but whose jealousy clouds their judgment. They let no man stand in their way, and are formidable even in fights at long odds.Egil Skallagrimsson, in particular, comes across as a force of nature. We see him in action across Scandinavia, in England where he fights with King Athelstan, and as far afield as the Baltic countries. His poetry, of which there are numerous examples in the saga, are interesting -- yet come from a tradition that is alien to ours, probably much closer to BEOWULF than any other English equivalent.Unlike so many other saga heroes, Egil dies a natural death, living long enough to lose his strength and be bossed about by servant women. Yet his poetic vision remains to the end:Life fades, I must fallAnd face my own endNot in misery and mourningBut with a man's heart.This is one of the five major Icelandic &quot;family&quot; sagas, along with NJALS SAGA, LAXDAELA SAGA, GRETTIR'S SAGA, and EYRBYGGJA SAGA. It may be the best of them all (though I have yet to read GRETTIR'S SAGA at this time). In that distant island so far from the harshness of Dark Ages Europe, a major literature was born that is dramatically different from anything else I have encountered, and that has the ability to move me as few things have.

Gordon C. Rhea marshals an impressive mass of detail about the events between Ulysses S Grant's movement from the lines on the North Anna River to the end of the Battle of Cold Harbor proper on June 3, 1864. I have heard many of the opinions about the battle ranging from the judgment of Grant as an unfeeling butcher on a large scale to Rhea's revisionist approach, which puts the casualties into some perspective for the campaign and the war as a whole.The title of my review, which comes from a quote by Lt Col Charles Cummings of the 17th Vermont, is a good description of the main battle. Cold Harbor looks forward to the grim battle lines of the First World War, where men dug in and ventured from their trenches at their peril. As the war went on, the veteran troops on both sides learned to dig in. It was the gung-ho new regiments from the North that had the heaviest casualties: They had not yet developed the basic survival skills.Rhea's study went in for such heavy detail that at times, I yearned for an occasional editorial perspective, which this author pretty much restricted to the first and last chapters.Robert E Lee came out relatively unsinged from Cold Harbor, but Grant has taken much of the blame for the unfortunate general staff culture of the Army of the Potomac. Remember that it was only a short time before that he took over the command, and he had to make do with prima donnas like Meade -- who comes off particularly badly -- as well as Burnside, Warren, and Wright. Even Baldy Smith, Grant's friend whom he had rescued from the country club atmosphere of Butler's command at Bermuda Hundred, spent most of the time (though somewhat justifiably) complaining about lack of food and ammunition, and contradictory commands from the top.After I finished reading this book, I looked up Grant's own memoirs and saw an interesting bit that Rhea omits entirely: After the battle, there was an exchange of letters between Grant and Lee (which Grant quotes verbatim) in which the Union general requests a truce to collect the dead and wounded. Lee refused repeatedly, until several days later, by which time only two of the many thousands wounded left on the battlefield survived. This is a serious charge and should be addressed in any book on Cold Harbor, if only to dismiss it. Perhaps Rhea will put it in his next volume?I was enchanted by Lee's inherent ability to create good ground for a battle by his knowledge of the countryside and his superior relationship to his staff officers. He was for certain a formidable and great adversary. Grant, on his side, was walking on eggshells. The nominating convention to select a candidate to run against Lincoln was about to take place: A complete route of the Union forces would have led to, God save us all, a President George B. McClellan.

After Japan emerged from its civil wars in the early 17th century, many clans were banned by the victorious Tokugawa Shogunate. Thousands of samurai warriors who knew the arts of war but precious little else suddenly found themselves thrown out onto the street.HARAKIRI tells of the chain of events set into motion when a destitute samurai goes to one of the remaining clans and offers to commit suicide according to the harakiri ritual. His real intent was to get a handout once the Iyi clan elder had seen his determination. This clan, however, had been hit up by other samurai in similar straits. The elder praises him and immediately has him prepare for suicide by disembowelment. When the young samurai requests a delay, the elder insists he begin immediately.I do not want to ruin the picture for anyone by giving anything away. Some time later (though earlier in the film, which skips around with the chronological story), the young samurai's father-in-law -- also a samurai -- shows up at the gate making the same request. This time the samurai is the redoubtable Tatsuya Nakadai. His intention is revenge, and he damned near lays waste to the entire clan to attain it.Kobayashi's direction of this elegant wide-screen epic may seem to be stodgy and talky at times, but the tale it tells will curdle the marrow of your bones. There is relatively little swordplay until Nakadai produces three small items from the folds of his kimono resulting in an all-against-one battle royal.This is one of the greatest of all the samurai films. No Jacobean revenge tragedy by Cyril Tourneur or John Webster can hold a candle to it in its ferocity. Kobayashi's film is Shakespearean in its breadth and holds up well to multiple viewings. This is a letterboxed print, so you see ALL the action.

Carlo Goldoni has written some of the most barbed comic plays on record. In THE VENETIAN TWINS, one brother shrugs his shoulders when his twin dies. In this play, MIRANDOLINA, a mistress of an inn toys with the affections of three noblemen who are staying there as well as of her manservant. The noblemen are drawn in broad brush strokes: one is a proud miser (the marquis); another, a brash money-solves-everything type (the count); the third, a self professed woman-hater (the baron). The main action of the play is how the woman, Mirandolina, chips away at the baron's misogyny while the marquis and the count vent their envy. Things get too hot, however, and Mirandolina has to make a choice. But I won't give away the ending. Sorry.Goldoni's plays are artfully written and look as if they would play well on the stage. It is said that Goldoni's main contribution is putting words in the mouth of the pantomime commedia dell'arte characters. When one does that, however, and still retains the commedia conventions, the result can come across as nasty and cold.

The other reviews I have read of this book are excellent, but I have decided to add my voice to show how the book has made me see history in a different light.From the outset, Schama shows us a people whose success is based on a shared moral vision that utterly permeates their art and literature. In this country, we tend to be fixated on the art of England, France, and Italy, with a few side-trips to Germany, Russia, and the Orient. Before Schama, I thought of the Netherlands as an &quot;auxiliary&quot; country with no particular vision of its own.I am delighted to have been proven wrong. THE EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES carries its theme like a mighty wave through hundreds of pages that read like a short essay. Here is this little country retrieved largely from the sea and mud, surrounded by powerful enemies who have repeatedly invaded and savaged it, and yet prevailing in its gentle and remarkably tolerant essence over the centuries. One does not survive this level of pain as a people unless one learns the lessons of cooperation, of tolerance, and of humor.Several weeks ago, I found myself in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. My attention was riveted by a still life of cut-up fruit and seafood that I had seen before, but never stopped to examine. This time I did and looked more closely. Swarming or buzzing over the food were a small army of ants and other insects. The painters of the Golden Age were trying to teach us a lesson, gently, of the transitoriness of all that is good and beautiful. Life is good now, but the waters and the nations are building up for another assault.

Whoa! There's a lot going on here in paucas palabras. We're in one of those border nightmares where Texas, Arizona, and Mexico all ooze together into some kind of sharp southwestern guisado with enough lard and chiles to singe your lips and leave a brownish cloud around your cabeza. Add jeans that are too tight, old cars, bad norteno music, and chicas that are muy guapa and hot to trot -- and you get Barry Gifford, the Sage of Big Tuna, at his very best.I've seen David Lynch's WILD AT HEART and LOST HIGHWAYS, both based on Gifford books, but straight Gifford hits you right upside the gut with a haymaker.The hot relationship between DelRay Mudo and Ava Varazo is interrupted when the latter blows away her pimp, Indio Desacato, and runs off to La Villania (Nasty), Mexico, to take up with an obscure political cause. Everything goes to hell when Cobra Box, her associate, goes to Bad Leopard, Idaho, to buy guns. Nobody ultimately gets together with anybody: just overheated bodies caroming around in a ranchero beat with the occasional gratuitous sex or violence. As Cairo Fly put it in his diary that closes the book, "Is it possible for a person's soul to stray away or be stolen and without it the person has no peace in their heart? I feel I am one of those now."There is something mesmerizing about Gifford's staccato chapters. Try too hard to follow the story, and you wind up like Thankful Priest with a bullet in your head in some godforsaken south of the border hellhole. No, man, just keep going to the beat. Sometimes, you fall off the edge of the world; sometimes you get good Tequila with your chilaquiles.I've got to get me some more of those Gifford books -- if this one's any indicator.

The story of William Wallace is based on a very few sources of widely varying credibility. When one is faced with such a situation, there are two courses of action possible. Ronald Williams facing an even greater dearth in his excellent LORD OF THE ISLES compensated by filling in the background so that the resulting read was a much richer experience. Unfortunately, MacKay seemed to spend over half the time dealing with inconsistencies of his sources. This makes for great scholarly debates -- but I think it should be relegated to the footnotes.When I read a book about so exciting a figure as William Wallace, I do not want to know where Blind Harry went wrong and a competing source was a tad better. I want to know why the peerage of Scotland was so fickle, why Edward I had such a thing about crushing the Scots and Wallace in particular, and why -- after Falkirk -- Edward was so ineffectual in conquering Scotland.

As a Hungarian-American, I was puzzled by this book. It attempts to show the tenor of life under Janos Kadar, who served as Magyar leader from 1956 until the fall of Soviet Communism in the late 1980s. Kadar walked a delicate tightrope between pleasing Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Gorbachev -- and pleasing his people. Esterhazy depicts this period as an era of pornography: One appears willing to enjoy like the nubile beauties in a porno movie, but in reality one is appalled by the fact that one is being used.The difficulty with a long extended metaphor is either that it breaks out of its shell and goes somewhere; or, in this case, it just spirals around and sputters out inconclusively.At times, Esterhazy sounds like a Hungarian William Burroughs in THE NOVA EXPRESS. I would be curious to see how the original reads in Hungarian, because the rendition into English seems to always be just a bit unidiomatic. There are numerous English slang phrases that make it look as if the translator has a tin ear.The only reason I rated this book a 3 is that every once in a while, it seems right on target, especially in the opening section. But, as in any book that contains no characters and no story, it slips out again. The Section entitled simply &quot;?&quot; seems particularly endless and painful, with its endless interrogatories.

I had the great fortune to meet George Mackay Brown while he was still alive, and the great MISfortune of not knowing what a great writer he was at the time. I was at Stromness in the Orkneys in October 1976 and had just come out of a bookstore where his picture was prominently displayed on the backs of several interesting books of poetry, essays, and fiction. I asked him, &quot;Are you George Mackay Brown?&quot; He smiled, answered, &quot;I do not deny it,&quot; and walked on with his hands in his pockets.Now that I have read several of his books and am continually scouring the world for more, I see this as one of the great missed opportunities of my life.Who was Magnus? Saint Magnus was one of the great Earls of Orkney in the time when the Isles owed their fealty to the Kings of Norway. Those Viking raids that so terrified Europe all stopped off at Orkney for provisions before going off to pillage the Southrons. Into this maelstrom came a saintly Viking (if that isn't an oxymoron!) named Magnus, who was forced to share power with one of his kinsmen. The latter decided to grab it all, and had Magnus butchered under a flag of truce.Brown takes episodes in Magnus's life and holds them up in the light to see how it reflects off their surfaces. In Magnus's death, he sees Auschwitz in one famous scene which many critics have disliked, but which I thought was brilliant. Somehow, it took a fellow Orcadian to see Magnus to his core; and Brown does it with majesty, lyricism, and love.In Kirkwall stands the 12th Century cathedral of St Magnus. I am not sure but that George Mackay Brown, that wild lonely man, built a greater one in this book.

A. R. Tschiffely gained his fame in the 1920s, when he took two Patagonian colts and rode them from Argentina all the way to New York. In the U.S., he was widely feted, featured in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and even met with then-president Calvin Coolidge.Twenty years later, toward the end of his life, Tschiffely had another fantastic trek. By car mostly (and some horseback riding), he travelled the whole length of Argentina along the coast down to Tierra del Fuego, and then he turned around and rode along the eastern edge of the Andes (along what is today Ruta 40) all the way back to Buenos Aires. Along the way, he stopped at the estancia where the two horses that helped make him famous, Mancha and Gato, were stabled. He was surprised and delighted to see that they still recognized him.Although Bruce Chatwin is probably the most famous writer about Patagonia with his 1977 book IN PATAGONIA, I would recommend THIS WAY SOUTHWARD as the better book. Chatwin did not know the land and the people as well as Tschiffely did, nor did he love them as much -- and it shows! Some of the most poignant scenes were encounters with the last of the Tehuelche Indians, far advanced in alcoholism and driven from the open land by the miners and sheep ranchers.A big plus is that Tschiffely is one of the great raconteurs of his time: He knew how to keep his listeners spellbound as he wove a humorous or harrowing tale, and this ability translates well into print. This is one author I would love to have met, sat down and had a drink with during his heyday.Even if Patagonia is not your cup of tea (it certainly is mine), this is a book you will enjoy. Our ancestors would see a blank spot on the map and proceed to explore it irrespective of danger or discomfort. Now, if someone rides more than a few miles, they call in a camera crew!

The Victorian era produced not only fainthearted boudoir queens with lace hankies, but also some of the most amazing and hard-bitten women travelers who ever lived. This is in many ways a companion volume to Julius Beerbohm's WANDERINGS IN PATAGONIA. Where Beerbohm was a rank amateur who had a knack for encountering bad luck, Lady Florence Dixie was like the up-to-date Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. She organized a large hunting party, threw money around for horses, supplies, and guides, and even engaged "Mr. B" to join the party.At first, Lady Florence comes across as a rich, thoughtless horsefaced boor. To more easily catch guanacos and ostriches (actually, Darwin's rheas), she and her party think nothing of starting brush fires and using beaters to drive the game into their guns' ranges. Starting at Punta Arenas, Chile (then called Sandy Point by the British), she and her party ride along the Magellan Channel and cut inland, heading ultimately towards the eastern escarpment of the Andes, probably southwest of El Calafate. (Unfortunately, there is no map in the book to indicate their progress.)Once she kills a small ostrich: "The flesh of the young ostrich is not very palatable, so we left the bird, taking only its legs, which make very nice handles for umbrellas and whips." Of Patagonian foxes: "I resolved to make a collection of their skins, and carry them back to England to be made up into rugs and other useful articles."Amid the stark beauty of the mountains, Lady Florence suffers a change of heart. She shoots a gigantic buck which puts up such a fight for life that she relents finally killing him. Even the guanacos have an astounding amount of fight in them: "Examining him, we found the bullet had entered his side, and passing through the lungs and lights, had lodged near the spine; and yet, thus severely wounded, he had gone quite ten miles at a cracking pace!"It is a sadder and more likeable Lady Florence who turns around and heads back to Punta Arenas. At this point, they encounter their own run of bad luck. They run out of food, the pack horse that has all their remaining biscuits runs off, all their horses suddenly disappear and have to be tracked down, and finally they appear back in civilization bedraggled and somewhat chastened.A real page-turner, RIDING ACROSS PATAGONIA is one of those strange books that show the writer's change of heart for the better. At one point, she even becomes disgusted with the concept of "man the destroyer."

We were returning from Greenwich tired and footsore. The LONDON MAPGUIDE indicated we could transfer to another bus to Paddington right on Russell Square. When we alighted, there were no layover stops for the elusive Bus #7. After tromping for ages around Bloomsbury, we gave up and hiked back past the British Museum to Oxford Street, where we knew we could get a bus.The flaw of this and all other map guides to London are the bus routes. The Underground is fun, but sometimes a bus is more convenient, and, as G. K. Chesterton wrote, the best way to see London is from the top of a double-decker bus.Even London Transport's &quot;Travelling in London&quot; folder doesn't do justice to the bus system. Granted, it is diabolically difficult to keep up with route changes, but if someone were to undertake it and do a more thorough job, the result would be a truly useful map guide.But don't let one complaint detract from the value of this otherwise outstanding guide. Because of the lack of bus information, most travellers take to the Underground and are quite satisfied with it. I still recommend THE LONDON MAPGUIDE and still would use it myself, if only for lack of anything better.

I used this guidebook in helping me plan a 1999 visit to the highlands and islands of Scotland. I was charmed by the author's stories and literary quotes, which not only provided an excellent background to the places we visited, but also a guide to some of the literature I wanted to read in conjunction with my travels.Through Ms. Miers' book, I learned of the work of the poet Sorley MacLean and the historian Martin Martin, who wrote a book about the isles of Scotland around 1700 that was instrumental in persuading Dr. Johnson to set off on his famous journey with Boswell years later.I learned that a medieval bishop in Caithness was set upon by an angry mob and fried in butter for daring to raise taxes on dairy production.Although my vacation is now just a memory, his book remains on my shelf. I liked it as a travel guide, but I loved it as a source of highland lore connected with some of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.Miers is sketchy on accommodation (but she did recommend some good places) and even more so on restaurants, but I prefer her book as a keeper. For strong accommodations &amp; restaurants, your best bet is the Rough Guide to Scotland.

Sir John Glubb is uniquely qualified to write about Muhammad and the rise of the Arab peoples inasmuch as he lived most of his life as a desert-loving British officer leading the Arab Legion for the Kings of Jordan. Around the time that Israel was born, he took the fall for the increasing unpopularity of British forces from both sides -- Arab and Jew -- and was let go by the late King Hussein.Far from being embittered by the experience, Glubb went on to write a number of exciting histories, an autobiography, and this life of Muhammad. In a way, it is good that this book is over 30 years old: It is untouched by any reference to September 11 and allows the reader an unprejudiced view of the Prophet and his followers without rancour or prejudice of any sort. At one point, the author states that he is a Christian, but feels as completely at home with sincere Muslims as with his fellow Christians.Three features make this a particularly useful book. For one thing, there are a dozen excellent maps. For those of us who have difficulty distinguishing from Arabic name from another, there are summaries of Notable Dates and Personalities at the end of each chapter to help fix the facts in the reader's memory. Finally, there is a respectable bibliography for further study.I was particularly gratified with Glubb's final paragraph, which very much speaks to us today: "If we Christians believe that we are more nearly executing the will of God than are adherents of other religions, it must surely be our duty to lead such lives as will draw all men of good will to ask the reason for our goodness. To treat them with arrogant contempt is more likely to convince them that ours is an intolerant and hard-hearted way of life." To which I can only add, Amen!

Theresa Maggio has done us a favor by providing a well-written book about a subject little-known to the English-speaking world: I refer to the mattanzas, or communal bluefin tuna kills, that have been a feature of Sicilian life for over a thousand years. In the process, she has introduced us to dozens of colorful characters and an obscure island off the northwest coast of Sicily.Curiously, it is the Japanese -- not the Italians -- for whom most of the tuna is reserved. They have factory ships offshore for processing the tuna into sushi and packing it to fly back home under ice. These mattanzas are intensely covered by the Japanese news media, as Ms. Maggio shows, because bluefin sushi is highly desirable, rare, and goes for astronomical prices in Tokyo.Over the last two or three decades, the number of tuna and their size has declined steadily. One reason is that, at the time the book was written, European fishermen had overfished the tuna using purse seines. Off the coast of North America, stricter controls are in effect to allow the species to recover.The process of luring the tuna into the elaborate traps for the mattanza is complex and deeply embedded in Sicilian lore. It calls for patience, strength, courage, and wiliness -- qualities which are fast disappearing as the knowledge has not been passed on due to the decreasing number of old hands available to impart the knowledge.The only failure of the book is not the author's, but the publisher's. Explanatory photos and more schematics than the single one (in Italian) appearing on the front and rear endpapers are essential to support the text. There are some small photos that are marginally discernible, but plates would have been better. The mattanza is a complicated event, and I feel this is a serious omission. In every other way, I wholeheartedly recommend Maggio's work.

Father of the famous essayist, critic, and caricaturist Max Beerbohm, Beerbohm senior had spent some time in Patagonia. There, he wrote this book and illustrated Lady Florence Dixie's RIDING ACROSS PATAGONIA, an equestrian classic that is still in print. Fortunately, Nonsuch Press resuscitated this early travel book which is well worth reading for aficionados of the Patagonian wastes.In WANDERINGS IN PATAGONIA, Julius Beerbohm writes about an overland journey he took between Puerto San Julian in the Argentine state of Santa Cruz to Punta Arenas in Chile (which he calls Sandy Point). A rank amateur, Beerbohm had no previous knowledge of the land, its flora and fauna. Fortunately, for the most part of the journey, he travelled with several old hands at ostrich hunting: the memorable pro Isidro, the Frenchman Guillaume, and the Austrian Maximo.Most memorable are the several chapters in which the group is stuck on the north side of the Rio Gallegos (near the present day site of the city of the same name) which was experiencing what we would call a hundred-year flood. The group splits up, with Julius and Guillaume venturing a dangerous crossing, which almost drowns our author. Then, when they finally arrive in Sandy Point, the local prison -- along with its military guard -- mutinies, gets drunk, and takes over the town, killing many of its citizens.Beerbohm's two encounters with Tehuelche Indians near the Rio Chico and the Strait of Magellan are well written, with some excellent characterizations.When pushed to it, Beerbohm is also capable of some memorable prose. In Chapter V, he writes:"It seemed like an unfinished portion of the globe, the very skeleton of a landscape. The outlines were there, indeed, the framework of the intended structure. There were bold hills, sheltered valleys, isolated peaks, deep basins; but over all was silence and desolation, all was empty and void. The finishing touch was withheld, -- the last touch which was to have softened and modulated those rugged contours, clothing their barrenness with verdure, filling the dry basins with clear water, and bringing life and gladness to what was now lying in sad and eternal deathliness."The only negative note -- other than the book's slow start -- is Beerbohm's rather obvious racist attitudes toward peoples with whom he was not familiar, notable the Chilotes (inhabitants of the island of Chiloe) and the Indians of Tierra Del Fuego. Having just finished E. Lucas Bridge's great book, THE UTTERMOST PART OF THE EARTH, in which both groups were extolled, I tend to trust Bridges more. He actually lived with them.

The first thing I saw when I opened my copy of this guide was the tip-in color map. It was a beautiful, the best I've seen available in a guidebook; and I wasted no time in removing it from the book.When I opened the guide, my heart sank. (The guide without the map merits only a single star.) There is no info on accommodations; restaurant info is limited to a handful of suggestions; and the coupons at the end are strictly two for one -- no help for someone like me traveling solo. The little one-square-inch maps scattered throughout the book are useful only with a powerful magnifier.If you take this to Iceland as your only guide, you will probably not have a good trip. If you take it at all, it is only excess weight. My recommendation: Stick with the newest Lonely Planet guide.

Arthur Morrison's THE DORRINGTON DEED-BOX has been near the top of my want list for over twenty years -- ever since Hugh Greene selected two of the six stories in it for his RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES series. When a highly random check revealed that the book was in print and available for well under the four digits used booksellers were charging, I pounced immediately.One of the most underrated British novelists of the last 150 years, Morrison has given us such literary classics as HOLE IN THE WALL, TALES OF MEAN STREETS (well before Raymond Chandler popularized the phrase), and CHILD OF THE JAGO. In addition, his several volumes of Martin Hewitt detective stories are almost on a par with Conan Doyle's.What sets this volume apart is that its protagonist, Horace Dorrington, is a far bigger scoundrel than Frazier's Flashman. He attempts to have one client drowned in a tank and scruples not to commit extortion and highway robbery at the slightest opportunity. At one or two points, he is almost on the side of good, but vitiates his status by cutting side-deals with the villains. Why Morrison never published any more collections in this series is beyond me.At a time when anti-heroes are more generally accepted, the DEED-BOX furnishes a pleasant combination of rampant immorality and genteel Victorian language.Indeed, it is well worth scouring used bookshelves for the "other" detectives, such as Ernest Bramah's blind detective, Max Carrados; R. Austin Freeman's Dr. Thorndyke; and Baroness Orczy's delicious and never named Old Man in the Corner. Happy hunting!

No one knows more about money problems than Honore de Balzac. He lived most of his life one step from his creditors: his house in Paris even had a special exit for avoiding them. CESAR BIROTTEAU is the story of an honest perfumer who is done in by the smarmy du Tillet, a former employee whom he had fired for embezzlement, who works in secret to take his revenge.Birotteau is lured into overextending himself and falls hard. True to his fascination with money and its epedemiology, Balzac delves into the guts of this bankruptcy and shows you all the forces at work to destroy an innocent man.This time, the innocent man prevails. Thanks to the help of Anselme Popinot, a brilliant young marketer in love with his daughter, Birotteau is able to pay back every cent, winning honor for himself after his life appeared to be all but over.This is one of Balzac's greatest novels. Birotteau is an honorable gentleman of the old school, a bit obtuse perhaps, but out of his depth among the wild speculations of the reign of Charles X. Watching these processes ensnare him is repellingly fascinating -- and Balzac spares us nothing.

In his long writing career, Anthony Trollope wrote 47 novels, dozens of short stories, plus assorted nonfiction such as the journal of a voyage to Iceland and a book about the Spanish Main. If you like his work as much as I do, you need a vade mecum, or companion, to help remind you which character belongs to which book, with assorted explanations of the major themes and background in the Victorian era in which Trollope is so firmly situated.R. C. Terry's encyclopedic reference is both well-informed and well-written, and certainly comprehensive. Its only competition is Richard Mullen's PENGUIN COMPANION TO TROLLOPE, which is not quite so useful. Terry's book has over 500 entries, including several aids to navigating its 600 pages. The entry for Griselda, Marchioness of Hartletop, for example, identifies the 8 Trollope novels in which she appears, at times as an important character. There is no equivalent entry in the Mullen book.Like Balzac, Proust, and Faulkner, Trollope has characters that frequently span two or more novels. This is especially true in the two big "sextets," the Barchester and Palliser novels, though not limited to them.Anthony Trollope's novels have been a source of great joy to me over the years. There are few reading experiences comparable to the frisson I get when opening a new Trollope novel for the first time. I would not be surprised that that thrill will recur when I start re-reading them, as I hope to do some day.

I was charmed and enthralled by Tommy &quot;Butch&quot; Bond's life story. Frankly, my expectations of show biz autobiographies is not high: Everyone seems to be so intent on blowing his or her own horn. Bond is a refreshing exception.First of all, I think the Little Rascals walk on water. Hundreds of years from now, some extraterrestial on the Moons of Jupiter with all z's and x's in his (its?) name will enjoy these short films as much as I did when I was growing up. They are universal in their appeal. We still haven't got to the point in our society that a Stymie, a Farina, or a Buckwheat can live next door to a Spanky, an Alfalfa, or a Butch. Hal Roach's Little Rascals were way ahead of their time.Of course, we all know what happened. MGM bought Our Gang from Roach and trashed the whole concept. It was time to move on and -- like so many child stars -- turn to booze, drugs, or crime. But wait a minute! Butch escapes the cliche and turns to radio, film, and even TV. And he marries the Texas beauty queen and lives happily ever after. Bond has this talent for reinventing himself and going from one positive experience to the other.Now who would have thought that the one member of the Little Rascals you should have grown up emulating was Butch the bully?This is a book that is not only well written: It will make you feel good about life.

As I read through this delightful summary of Franz Kafka's life and work, I was struck by the fact that both the Czech writer and the cartoonist R. Crumb have the same anguished yearning for determined young women. Curiously, these all have the strong legs, broad beams, and statuesque torsos of Crumb's fantasy women from Zap Comix to today. Perhaps, Crumb and Kafka have more in common than meets the eye.They are all there: Gregor Samsa's sister, the luscious Milena Jesenska, the Advocate's "nurse" Leni, Olga and Frieda from THE CASTLE, and the ravishing Dora Diamant. These women are all more durable than both Kafka and Crumb, who are wispy and likely to blow away in the next puff of wind. (I recommend that you see the excellent film documentary of the cartoonist's life, called, appropriately, CRUMB.)When one concentrates on the women in Kafka's life and work, the result is curiously enlightening. "None of his female characters seems to have her own existence," writes David Zane Mairowitz, "but is spawned in his imagination in order to distract 'K' or 'Joseph K,' to tempt and ensnare him. Kafka's sexual terror is put to the test time after time, yet these same women provide something more.... The outcome of these relationships is rarely 'intimate' (Leni being an exception) and has more to do with power than personal feelings. Kafka's talent would mostly SUGGEST erotic encounter, rather than indulging his characters in that act which he found 'repellent and perfectly useless.'"Perhaps Mairowitz and Crumb do not provide a measured and scholarly study of the writer, but within a mere 175 pages they have done more to rekindle my interest in Kafka than anything else I have ever read about him. This book is a perfect gem and a work of art in its own right.

As we continue to pave over the beauties of our world and turn them into concrete wastelands, it is good to think back what life was like 150 years ago before we began the process of destruction in earnest.W. H. Hudson, the naturalist, is revered in Argentina, where they refer to him as Guillermo Enrique Hudson and name streets and towns after him. In simple and stately prose, he writes about his boyhood as one of several sons in an English family that ran an estancia on the Pampas. Despite several failed attempts to school him, he managed to pick up one of the best educations available: by using his eyes and ears to study nature. His skill in language, which is considerable, came from reading his father's books on his own.Whether writing about ombu trees, plovers, snakes, lightning storms, rheas (Argentinian ostriches), or his neighboring ranchers, Hudson brought a whole world to life with this book.Hudson published FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO in 1917 while he was living in England -- around the same time that a Frenchman named Marcel Proust was following where that elusive taste of madeleines led him in REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST, and around the same time that World War I was destroying a whole way of life. As he writes in the book:"It is difficult, impossible I am told, for any one to recall his boyhood exactly as it was. It could not have been what it seems to the adult mind, since we cannot escape from what we are, however great our detachment may be; and in going back we must take our present selves with us: the mind has taken a different colour, and this is thrown back upon our past. The poet has reversed the order of things when he tells us that we come trailing clouds of glory, which melt away and are lost as we proceed on our journey. The truth is that unless we belong to the order of those who crystallize or lose their souls on their passage, the clouds gather about us as we proceed, and as cloud-compellers we travel on to the very end."FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO is perhaps one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. Although I finished reading it several days ago, I am still feeling its afterglow and get this itch to re-read passages from it. This is, indeed, a book that will withstand several readings.

Nigel Tranter's historical novels are so many windows into Scotland's tragic history, ranging from the days of the Druids through the Middle Ages and the struggles for independence to our own time. Typically (the Robert the Bruce trilogy is a notable exception), he takes either a minor or even fictional character and makes him the lens through which the characters and deeds of the times are experienced.ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY is no exception. Patrick, Earl of Dunbar and March, is made to serve as a mirror to the short reign of Alexander III (1249-1286) -- the last legitimate monarch before Edward I of England (&quot;The Hammer of the Scots&quot;) asserted his claims over the realm, leading to the Wars of the Bruces and the short career of William Wallace. As such, a pall of doom hangs over the story as Alexander's reign winds to a close.Things begin hopefully enough: Despite a long and troubled regency after the sudden death of his father in the Western Isles, Alexander asserts himself by winning a decisive victory over the Norse and their Hebridean allies at Largs (1264), after which Norway renounced all claims to the Hebrides: Never again would Viking raids be a major threat to the Scots. It is the growing aggressiveness of Edward I to the south that become ever more worrisome to the young monarch.The anxiety finds a focus in the historical character of Thomas Learmonth, known as Thomas the Rhymer or True Thomas, whose prophecies of doom clouded Alexander's last days as he sees his hopes for maintaining his dynasty crumble before his accidental death from falling off a horse. Earl Patrick serves his monarch well to the end, and then sadly returns to his lands resolved to involve himself no longer as an envoy for the monarchy. In a brief epilogue, Tranter describes how the end of the dynasty led directly to the Wars of Independence.While not the best of Tranter's work (the Bruce Trilogy takes that honor), ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY is a great read for those who, like me, prefer a large dollop of history with their fiction.

I have used Michael Middleditch's Penguin map guides of London and Paris and found them to be attractive and incredibly useful, but they all pale before the excellent job he did with THE NEW YORK MAP GUIDE. For once, he does a great job showing bus as well as subway routes (a problem with the Paris and London guides). The introductory material on places of interest and the back-of-the-book guide to parks, New York architecture, entertainments, and walking tours are compact and exceedingly well done.My only complaint is that not exactly all of Manhattan is mapped: missing are Inwood, Washington Heights, Spanish Harlem, and parts of Harlem. Okay, so these aren't exactly the biggest tourist draws, but I would kind of like to see how to get to the Cloisters and a couple of other tourist sights. Perhaps the publisher should have drawn a few pictures of dragons and sea monsters along the unmapped tierra incognita...But why kvetch? So there's a slice taken out of the Big Apple! There's enough left to help fuel several excellent vacations. I couldn't imagine taking a trip to NYC without it.

What can one do when your only source for a major historical event like Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe was, in all probability, written by a spy? Antonio Pigafetta was an Italian from Vicenza who is thought to have written his journal for the Venetians, the Pope, or the Emperor Charles V.It is interesting that Pigafetta wrote very little of the voyage out to the Spice Islands (the archipelago that includes present day Indonesia and the Philippines), and even less about the return under Sebasti&aacute;n de Elcano, who took over after Magellan was killed in battle at Cebu in the Philippines. Most of his relation is concerned with detailed descriptions of the people and lands of the Spice Islands, including detailed glossaries of words in the various languages that might be of interest to merchants trading in the area. Just what you'd think one would do if he were reporting back to someone else.As a reporter of people and cultures, Pigafetta was far ahead of his time. As a reporter of a voyage of exploration, however, he is somewhat inadequate. It quickly becomes apparent that the workings of the ship are not his concern. After describing the horrendous 98-day voyage across the Pacific, he ends up by smugly saying that he himself did not get ill -- possibly because he may have had his own private food stock. He describes the relatively placid Cape of Good Hope off South Africa as the most dangerous part of the voyage, probably because he had a rare peaceful crossing of the otherwise stormy Straits of Magellan.This edition is not the most attractive, and typographically it is difficult to read. The maps provided by Pigafetta serve only to show certain islands with respect to one another, and do not help the reader of his relation in the slightest in terms of their topography or even shape. But then Dover is known for producing relatively inexpensive reprints of works that are in the public domain. Any blame on the edition falls on Yale University, who produced the original.

Dover's collections of ghost, horror, and mystery stories are among the best deals in the paperback book world. I read this volume around Halloween, and it made what little hair I have left curl and vanish. The quality of the individual stories varies greatly, with the best being "Wandering Willie's Tale" by Sir Walter Scott, "Doctor Heidegger's Experiment" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the much-anthologized "The Horla" by Guy de Maupassant. Also included is the classic "The Monkey's Paw" by W. W. Jacobs and "Dracula's Guest" by Bram Stoker. In all, there are eighteen different stories by sixteen authors.My copy of the book was purchased some many years ago and still looks great for a paperback, so you don't have to feel any compunctions buying a used copy in good condition.This book will give you many hours of scary enjoyment. What more can I say?

Film critic Pauline Kael used to refer to a certain category of 1960s film (such as LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD and LA DOLCE VITA) as the "Come Dressed as the Sick Soul of Europe" party. PLATFORM by Michel Houellebecq would certainly get its author an engraved invitation.There's a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Ostensibly, it is a novel about European tourism in developing countries, particularly Thailand and Cuba. The narrator, Michel, is a civil servant charged with the responsibility of mounting cultural exhibitions. On a tour to Thailand, he meets the shy but lovely Valerie and dreams about her while having casual sex in massage establishments enroute.When he returns to France, he meets up with Valerie again and a very physical relationship ensues that seems to belie Valerie's earlier shyness. He also meets up with Valerie's boss, Jean-Yves, who is an international resort executive whose marriage is on the rocks. All three decide to visit a resort in Cuba which has been underperforming to try to find a way to turn it around. It is Michel who comes up with the idea of turning it, and many other resorts, into (in effect) brothels.One of the aspects of the novel I found most interesting is its description of violent crime in the banlieus of Paris -- at a level which would shock many Americans. Michel finds a certain innocence in the developing world that constrasts sharply with the played-out European landscape in which relationships are impossible, children become violent hoodlums, and the birth rate is dropping into the red zone.Michel's idea is well received by the resort chain and immediately put into action. The three now go to Thailand (again) to set up a prototype. Everything goes swimmingly -- until something happens that sinks forever any notion of the developing world's innocence. I will not divulge the ending here, but suffice it to say that it came as a shocker!Houellebecq was recommended to me by an American friend who lives part of the year in the Montreuil section of Paris. He took up with the author because he found that it is written in a simple French that is easy for a non-Frenchman to understand. Be warned, however, that this is a sexually graphic novel which might put off some readers. It didn't put me off; and I look forward to reading his other work.

I remember having this book read to me when I was a child. It was only when I saw a photograph of some of the illustrations in a book review of the NYRB reprint that I ordered a copy for myself and devoured it. All through my childhood, I knew of Odin the One-Eyed, duplicitous Loki, and the willowy Freya -- but I had not recalled where it was that I learned about them.One of the things that most struck me about the wooing and fighting gods of Asgard was that they were mortal. The world tree, Yggdrasil, was threatened by a dragon in Niflheim that gnawed at its roots; and the giant wolf Fenris was hogtied by a magic cord. Around the same time, both of them cut loose and attacked. What ensued was Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods.Why the old Norse peoples should have killed off their gods was always a question in my mind. Did it happen before or after Olaf Tryggvason, the Kind of Norway, was converted to Christianity around the year A.D. 1000? It does make some sense to establish the new religion by dusting off the old.This book has stayed with me for the better part of a lifetime. As a parent, I think you can certainly do worse than sharing this memorable book and its glowing illustrations with your children.One little footnote: Last Christmas, I sponsored a wolf at the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in Ramah, NM whose name is Fenris. Look out, world!

I remember my father telling me how he kept "colored" workers out of the factory in Cleveland where he worked: He gave them a very low workbench so that they would have to bend down to operate the machinery and so suffer excruciating back pain until they quit.Now turn that around and BE that worker. Feel the mounting frustration, the fear and loathing. Not once, not a dozen times, not seven times seventy times. But every waking moment of every day.What Chester Himes does in this first volume of his autobiography is to make you, the reader, feel that frustration. You can see how it worked its way into Chester Himes's work, his relationships, even between the pores of his skin. It explodes into self-destructiveness when he is arrested and convicted for armed robbery, serving a seven and a half year sentence in the Ohio Penitentiary. When he could take it no more, he escapes to Europe. He spends time in France, England, and Spain and finds some few places where he could be a man without arousing strong antipathy.The early scenes in the United States have a frenetic quality about them, as Himes is always on the move. "And although I did not it at that time, I was never to stop moving, always one jump ahead of disaster, always a hair's breadth away from destitution; until I can truthfully say there has been nothing in my life but change." (p. 293)The second half of the book deals with his relationship with a white women named Alva whom he had met on the boat ride over to Europe. From Paris, they move to Arcachon, and then to London -- where the prejudice is so thick you could cut it with a knife -- and from thence to Mallorca and finally back again to Arcachon and Paris. All this takes place before the success of his Harlem detective novels with Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson."The American black is a new race of man ...," he writes on p. 285. "And for those hackneyed, diehard, outdated, slaverytime racists to keep thinking of him as a primitive is an insult to the intelligence. In fact, intelligence isn't required to know the black is a new man -- complex, intriguing, and not particularly likeable. I find it very difficult to like American blacks myself...."There is something rough-hewn and brutally honest about Himes that I've always liked. I could not stop thinking, however, that it was he who ran into my father in Cleveland and got the low workbench.

Poet Octavio Paz has journeyed across much of the twentieth century landscape in this short book of essays. As a son of La Malinche (see his LABYRINTH OF SOLITUDE), he maintained a clearheaded sense of balance while his contemporaries were losing their heads over communism, surrealism, existentialism, and all the other isms that characterized that time.What has always amazed me that Paz was at one and the same time both a truthsayer and a poet. Even to someone like myself whose Spanish is less than idiomatic, his poetry possesses a beauty and limpidity that are almost never met in combination. Only Emily Dickinson of the poets I know has this quality. One of my favorites is the poem "Epitafio sobre ninguna piedra" from which the title of this review is taken.Now that communism is all but extinct, one forgets that only a short while ago it held so many intellectuals in thrall. Looking at our situation today, Paz concludes that "if I am sure of one thing it is that we are living an interregnum; we are walking across a zone whose ground is not solid; its foundations, it basis has evaporated. If we wish to climb free from the marsh and not sink into mud we should quickly work out a morality and a politics." I think that, as a people, we have not. I am reminded of Yeats's "The Second Coming":The best lack all convictionWhile the worst are full of passionate intensityA final word: Toward the end is a beautiful little essay entitled "Imaginary Gardens: A Memoir" which, while responding negatively to a proposal for a public park, lets loose a Proustian flood of memory regarding the past of the town where Paz was raised, Mixcoac.This little book, which can be read in a single sitting, deserves a wide readership. I loved it and feel impelled to seek out more of Paz's work.

Having just spent more than 2 weeks in Iceland, I've had a good opportunity to see which guides worked and which ones didn't. To begin with, Cathy Harlow's excellent book is more along the lines of the DK Guidebooks: excellent pictures, printed on heavy glossy paper, and short on up-to-date, detailed info on accommodations and restaurants.In other words, this is a book to read and enjoy BEFORE going to Iceland, but it takes up too much weight for the info it conveys. Let's face it, the 20-kilo weight restriction for international flights, together with the even more severe practical limitations for people who use public transportation where there are no porters or native bearers are strong reasons to travel as light as possible.Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading this book and would strongly recommend both the texts and photographs as an excellent introduction to a fascinating travel destination. Used in conjunction with the Rough Guide to Iceland or, even better, the updated Lonely Planet Guide to Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, it is a worthwhile book to read and to keep for reference.

I've always been a sucker for mysteries set in exotic locales, such as the Napoleon Bonaparte novels of Arthur W Upfield set in the Australian outback or the Inspector Ghote stories of H R F Keating. John Burdett's BANGKOK 8 bids fair, however, to take the grand prize. Not only is Bangkok as exotic a city as you'll find, but Detective Sonchai Jitleecheep is the only member of the Royal Thai police force who doesn't take bribes or visit prostitutes -- mostly because he is a devout Buddhist.When an American NCO is attacked and killed by a crazed python and a dozen cobras in his air-conditioned Mercedes of all places, Sonchai and his partner are sent to investigate. Sonchai's partner and soul brother dies from snakebite while investigating, leaving Sonchai to weigh the un-Buddhist possibility of revenge.Bangkok itself takes star billing in this intriguing novel. Traffic jams are so impossible that the only way to get around is either by helicopter or motorcycle taxis driven by meth-addicted drivers. Prostitution is an integral part of the landscape, and even Sonchai's own mother is an ex-whore who plans to become the mamasan of a brothel for older men.I challenge anyone to solve the plot. Until the very end, it just seems to get more tangled, but Burdett neatly ties all the loose ends. The only weak point is Kimberley Jones, a young female FBI agent who falls for Sonchai, largely because her character is too static while everything around her seems to change at the speed of light.By the end, it is Thailand that seems normal, and the U.S. that seems to be stuggling in a sea of apparent illogic:"What we don't realize, we Thais, is just how simple life is in the West. Too simple. The most modest of contributions -- a forty-hour week at the least demanding of mechanized tasks -- one earns a car, an apartment, a bank account. Other gifts of the system -- a spouse, a child or two, a small collection of friends -- arrive automatically and gift-wrapped with support of every kind. A whole hemisphere, in other words, lies dying from event-starvation."

Those of us who have followed the writing career of Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) from outside of Argentina have seen him primarily as the pathetic old blind man grasping on to the arms of his visitors as they wended their way to some caf&eacute; in the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires. What this excellent short biography by Jason Wilson reminds us is that Borges was at one time a dashing young man who lived through exciting times.At the same time, he always lived with his mother. It was not until Do&ntilde;a Leonora died at an advanced age that Borges contracted marriage with Maria Kodama, a younger student of his who was willing to "do" for him in his old age. There is even some question as to whether the author ever had a normal sexual life outside of dealings with prostitutes, which went against his grain, especially after his father forcibly precipitated his sexual experience with his own mistress in a Geneva brothel.Perhaps Borges felt there was a congenital doom in his family. His father, too, had gone blind; but surgery corrected his vision a few years before he committed suicide. These are not conditions that are conducive to a normal, happy and healthy sex drive.What Borges lacked in that department is more than made up for the power of his imagination. During an almost Buddhist burst of contemplation in the late 1930s and early 1940s--just before his own blindness set in--Borges completed most of the poems and stories for which he is famous. The sad truth is that, after Borges became known outside of Argentina, his career was in decline. He continued to write, but never so much or so well as before.Nonetheless, he was the recipient of many international awards--except for the biggest one of all. Because he met with, smiled, and shook the hands of two South American tyrants, Generals Videla of Argentina and Pinochet Ugarte of Chile, a member of the Swedish Academy resolved to blackball Borges every time his name came up for nomination. (It galls me that so many inferior talents have won the Nobel Prize for Literature, but then, that's politics for you.)Jason Wilson has written a short but sweet book that I heartily recommend to everyone who loves Borges as much as I do. Ever since 1969, when I first read LABYRINTHS, Borges has in a sense been my mentor in the world of literature; and I feel that Wilson has written an incisive and just book about this great author.

This is more of a personal note than a review, but it serves to show how a children's book can resonate through an entire lifetime.My first encounter with THE KING'S STILTS was hearing my mother translate each sentence into Hungarian for me. I was less than five years old, and lying in my crib. As she turned each page, she leaned the book toward me and showed me the picture. I remembered those pictures, and that fragile world under sea level -- a world constantly under threat of annihilation by wicked black birds who attacked the trees on the levee which were protected only by cats.The place was Cleveland in the then Hungarian neighborhood around Buckeye Road. Because everyone around us was Magyar, my parents never taught me English until I got sent home from kindergarten with a note pinned to my shirt: "What language is this child speaking?" Needless to say, Mrs Idell was not one of my countrywomen.Throughout my life, I was always impressed with levees, as when I read William Faulkner's story "Old Man" and John McPhee's essay on keeping the banks of the Mississippi in place in THE CONTROL OF NATURE. One day, I had a madeleine-like damburst of memory: I saw the book almost entire in my mind's eye and used a search engine to reveal the title. Reader, I bought the book; and it was exactly as I remembered.I have read it several times since and love it for the reason that it stuck in my memory for more than 55 years. Of course, it's a rollicking good story, too, with an excellent moral: Never give up the things you love.

When we went to Amsterdam last May, we had no idea what we were going to see. Because we tend to plan our itineraries in advance, it was important that we get some idea of which tourist sights were worth seeing. The DK Eyewitness guides are great for this purpose: They are lavishly illustrated, with colorful maps, schematics, and -- above all -- photographs of tourist destinations in and around Amsterdam.I would NOT, however, recommend that you take this guide with you. It weights 1 pound 3 oz; and we always travel light. So what we recommend is to do your Stateside planning with the DK guide and use a lighter one to accompany you on your travels. It's a pity, because the transportation and street maps alone are worth the price of the guide.A major plus for us is that we chose to visit the Zuiderzee Museum in Enkhuizen partly because it looked interesting in the book; and it turned out to be by far our favorite stop.Like other DK guides, this one has an excellent &quot;Practical Information&quot; section on currency, banking, telephoning, and public transportation. It also have colorful pictures of the type of food you might encounter in Amsterdam's restaurants. (And do try the raw new herring with onions and pickles: If you're a sushi-head like me, you will be in heaven.)Where I would not use this guide is for names of specific hotels and restaurants. The information on these is presented in tabular format and leaves off many interesting sidelights that would be important for us as travellers, such as roominess, charm, family ownership, and other intangibles.It's well worth the somewhat steep price to buy this book if you're planning a trip to the Netherlands.

Wit is such a rare phenomenon in contemporary literature that we often cannot recognize it. And when we do, we underestimate it. It's all so 18th century and so, so not now.McEwan spins a short, simple tale of two men who once vied for the same woman's favors coming together at her funeral and vowing eternal friendship ... and a few other things which I can't divulge. It's pretty hard to identify with the two gentlemen -- one the editor of a newspaper and the other a renowned composer. The first bets the farm on publishing some compromising photographs of an up-and-coming Tory politician (who also was one of the late lady's lovers); the other watches a serial rapist at work in the Lake District and continues composing his symphony rather than risk involvement. The two friends take umbrage at each other and their friendship turns to bitter antipathy.The ending is as neat and symmetrical as Mozart's MARRIAGE OF FIGARO or COSI FAN TUTTI.If I need to wear a powdered wig to enjoy such entertainment, let it be so! McEwan has a wicked sense of humor and a deft touch with this little entertainment. (And it was a nice diversion after reading 730 pages of Proust.)Let the petards be hoisted and the games begin!

Don't be put off by the seemingly trivial subject matter of this delightful book, namely: The story of a journey made by George Washington from West Point to his home at Mount Vernon between the conclusion of the peace treaty with Britain and Christmas 1783.It was official: The United States of America was now recognized as a sovereign nation -- or was it thirteen nations? It becomes very apparent as the Father of Our Country crosses New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia on his way home that Americans were not all that sure what they had on their hands. The cobbled-together Articles of Confederation took the easy way out by giving all rights to the states and virtually none to a central government.As Washington bid farewell to the officers who had served him so well, many times he had to reach into his own pocket to allow them the luxury of returning home safely to their loved ones. Who was there to ask for money? The states simply weaseled out of any fiscal responsibilities when they involved another state. Even in 1783, this structure was teetering on the edge of collapse; and it continued for several more years until the Constitution was adopted.There is a sense of newness in Weintraub's America in the Winter of 1783. The only thing the people had in common was their love of and reverence toward George Washington. Wherever he stopped on his trek, people emerged from all sides to honor him with balls and ceremonial dinners. They came together to marvel in the strangeness of their freshly-won independence. It is like Cortez and his companions in Keats' &quot;On First Looking into Chapman's Homer&quot;: &quot;And all his men / Look'd at each other with a wild surmise...&quot;I like this book most for giving me a feeling of what it was to be an American at a time that most historians have seen fit to ignore. Stanley Weintraub saw a psychological moment in the history of a people and shrewdly built his story around the character of the man who held the whole shooting match together: General George Washington.Don't expect penetrating scholarship here. Just enjoy this sparkling gem of a book and use it to point you in other directions for the big picture.

This is a short story collection that ranges from the prosaic to the poetic. The title story (&quot;Shifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh&quot;) is a delightful tale of an unemployed factory worker who gets incredibly creative and makes out like a bandit until he meets some clients that are out of this world. The Chinese director Zhang Yimou made turned this story into a film called HAPPY DAYS.Other than the opener, my favorite stories are &quot;Abandoned Child,&quot; which makes a strong statement about the continuing practice of female infanticide; &quot;Love Story,&quot; about an unlikely love affair set in the countryside; the strange fantasty &quot;Iron Child&quot; about a possible outcome of over-industrialization; and the incredibly poetic &quot;Man and Beast,&quot; which the author claims is a sequel to his novel RED SORGHUM (although I missed some of the references, I was enthralled).In his preface, Mo Yan (which, by the way, is Chinese for &quot;Don't Speak&quot;) says his muses were hunger and loneliness. In fact, the author has a unique rapport with the lives of peasants and workers, as opposed to many more intellectual writers in exile such as Gao Xingjiang. I have already read THE GARLIC BALLADS and plan to read more of this fascinating writer.
