It's funny to me that John Coltrane's most popular album is also the one that was his first step toward the spiritual, intense free jazz of his final recordings. As you can see from these amazon reviews, the detractors frequently focus on this - it's a lot further away from bebop and ballads than Blue Train, Giant Steps, My Favorite Things, the album with Johnny Hartman, or the recordings with Miles Davis. Coltrane and his quartet uses abstract harmonies and rhythms (though they would go a lot further in the next two and a half years); Coltrane's playing uses plenty of nonconventional devices - squawks, screams, growls - and strains past the tenor saxophone's normal range.If this sounds too much for you, this is not the place to start with Coltrane's recordings. You're better off trying the recordings I mentioned above first. Maybe over time you'll grow to love those recordings enough to try this one. If you don't, that's cool. A potential primer for A Love Supreme is the album immediately preceding it, Crescent, which is similar stylistically but more accessible.There are also lots of people for whom this would be a great introduction to jazz. If you listen to rock with plenty of long, instrumental passages - Santana, Cream, Zeppelin, Hendrix, Zappa, the Allman Brothers, the Grateful Dead, Yes, King Crimson, etc. - then this album will likely make a lot of sense to you. Many of these musicians were clearly influenced by Coltrane, and this album.If you get this album and love it, you may be wondering where to go next. A newbie may want to check out other classic, popular jazz albums (amazon has plenty of recommendations) or the list of Coltrane recordings outlined above. Some may warm to this album's experimental edge and want to find out "where Coltrane went next" - you can jump into the deep end with Ascension, Meditations and Interstellar Space, or take a more cautious approach with The John Coltrane Quartet Plays and Transition.Finally, there are several editions of this on the market. If you're a casual fan, I'd stick to the 1-disc version - it's more than enough. If you're pretty sure you're going to become a big Coltrane fan, I would consider the 2-CD version instead - it has the fantastic live version of A Love Supreme.Whichever way you go, this album is a jazz classic - one of John Coltrane's best recordings and a personal favorite of mine.

A Must for Serious Coltrane FansFirst, a disclaimer - if you are new to jazz and are curious about this "A Love Supreme" recording you've heard so much about, this 2-CD deluxe edition is probably not the place to start. Also, if you have heard A Love Supreme and it pushes the limits of what you consider to be good music, then this might not be a good set to pick up. The 1 CD version is floating around and I encourage you to dive in.If you're a hardcore Coltrane fan - there are plenty of us out there - then this album is pretty much a must-buy. The original album is on disc 1 - it has better sound than the 90s and 80s editions of the album, though I think it's identical to the 2003 and 2008 single versions.The reason to pick this up, though, is the 2nd disc. The biggest treasure is the live version of A Love Supreme, recorded in July 1965. Over the 7 months separating this from the studio recording, Coltrane's playing and that of his quartet had become more abstract and experimental; it has much less "prettiness" and serenity than in the studio, but replaces those qualities with more fire and spiritual intensity. Ascension had been recorded one month earlier; Sun Ship would be recorded one month earlier. This is, in my opinion, among the best live performances Coltrane ever recorded - easily on par with the 1961 Village Vanguard sessions. The sound is not as good as an RVG production, but it sounds like a clean radio broadcast and only a very sensitive listener will be disappointed. It's certainly better than the unofficial versions that many fans have already heard.The other key item of interest is the long-lost "second A Love Supreme session", with Archie Shepp and Art Davis joining the quartet for two takes of "Acknowledgment". Neither of these match the originally released quartet version, but they do offer a very interesting alternative.We also get two alternate takes of "Resolution" from the main A Love Supreme session, one complete and one aborted. I listen to these least of all the material on this two disc set.To reiterate, if you love John Coltrane's music, this is essential listening.

In the winter of 1960, Miles Davis convinced John Coltrane to come on tour with him to Europe. Coltrane was itching to leave and form his own group, but agreed while letting Miles know this was going to be the last time.Several recordings of that tour survive, including this one. Miles's repertoire at the time consisted mostly of standards, most of which his fans had heard on classic albums like Walkin', Relaxin' and 'Round About Midnight. Miles's playing couldn't have disappointed them; he takes more chances on the bandstand, but that spare lyricism is in full bloom. And the French audiences at this Olympia concert surely enjoyed the supremely groovin' and swingin' rhythm section of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb.Their feelings on John Coltrane's playing can be determined from the mix of boos and cheers on &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;. It's an incredible solo, long and convoluted, mixing in his lyricism with a high level of intensity and all sorts of avant-garde sounds that were still novel to many jazz fans -- even those familiar with Trane's playing on Milestones and Kind of Blue. (Not sure if Giant Steps was already out, but it wouldn't have offered much help either.) You can already hear Trane looking past &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (which he would record seven months after this concert) to the tour-de-force explorations of &quot;Chasing the Trane&quot; and &quot;Impressions&quot; at the Village Vanguard. His playing on &quot;Walkin'&quot; is equally electrifying.This release will appeal to all sorts of people. There isn't much of the structural experimentation of the 1964 and 1965 recordings, but those looking for something edgy will love Coltrane's playing. Those who love 50s Miles will find a lot to love as well -- Miles's playing and the swinging rhythm section.

This is one of my favorite albums by Paul Motian's trio with Bill Frisell and Joe Lovano. It's the only one of their JMT recordings to focus entirely on Motian's original compositions and their final visit to the recording studio for over a decade.The album alternates, quite straightforwardly, between mellower "ballads" (the odd numbered tracks) and more intense, angular free jazz (the even-numbered tracks). "It Should've Happened a Long Time Ago" is performed with much more depth than the original version on ECM; the dreamy theme inspires brilliant solos by Lovano and Frisell, as well as sterling accompaniment by Motian. "Cosmology" features some great "outside" playing by all three musicians. "Jack of Clubs", with its darkly humorous melody, features Lovano and Frisell in short unaccompanied solos. "Monica's Garden" has Motian laying down some nice, laid back swing and "In Remembrance of Things Past" substitutes the great Dewey Redman for Lovano. "Zabel" is a Frisell solo piece.Overall this is a more uptempo, energetic album than the trio's most recent release, the beautiful I Have the Room Above Her. There's a lot more of Frisell's screaming distorted guitar and Lovano's avant-garde leanings. It's also more challenging than their tributes to Broadway, Monk and Bill Evans. Those who like this trio will find a lot to enjoy here.

Even though Fifth Dimension may be the most innovative album of the Byrds' career, Younger than Yesterday may be the most enduring. Showing the influence of Pet Sounds and Revolver with more layered production (including great trumpet playing by Hugh Masakela) and increasingly sophisticated songs, the Byrds hit gold here. Dave Crosby really steps up his songwriting here -- Crosby with the mournful &quot;Everybody's Been Burned&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot;. (He also contributed the experimental &quot;Mind Gardens&quot;, which isn't quite as successful.) Roger McGuinn comes up a little short though his 12-string playing on &quot;My Back Pages&quot;, one of their last Dylan covers, is unforgettable.But it is bassist Chris Hillman, a relatively minor composer on the first three Byrds albums, who ends up being the dominant creative force here. In addition to writing or co-writing the infectious folk-rock double-knockout of &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot; and &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star&quot;, he ventures into country (&quot;Time Between&quot;, &quot;The Girl With No Name&quot;) and unsettling psychedelia (&quot;Thoughts and Words&quot;). These songs alone justify buying this CD.The original album was quite short (about 30 minutes), but this remaster of Younger than Yesterday includes several alternate takes and bonus tracks. The best of these is Crosby's catchy, symphonic &quot;Lady Friend&quot;.Younger than Yesterday is up there with Revolver and the Piper at the Gates of Dawn as one of the highlights of 60s psychedelic rock.

Freddie Redd has never achieved the popularity or influence of other 50s jazz pianists, but for those eager to dig a little deeper into hard bop piano should check him out. Redd's style is definitely original, though at times recalling both Monk and Powell. His recording catalogue is a little skimpy and his Blue Note albums seem to be out of print, so this is probably the best place to start. (By the way, the label on this disc says it is a limited edition; not sure what this means, since it has been in print since 1990. Better safe than sorry, though.)The highlight of the October '57 recording (at least to a native northern Californian like me) is Redd's &quot;San Francisco Suite&quot; -- 14 minutes of Redd's impressions of the City by the Bay. Redd composes themes for various places: the view of the Golden Gate from Sausalito, Chinatown, an after-hours bar, etc., and the trio improvises in between. The celeste Redd plays on the Chinatown theme is a nice touch. The last six tracks are a mix of originals and standards, performed in a swinging fashion by the trio of Redd, bassist George Tucker and drummer Al Dreares. Anyway, if you want to explore 50s bop piano beyond Monk, Powell and Silver you should listen to this album.

My Song was the second, and final, studio album by Keith Jarrett's European Quartet. Unlike Belonging (the first album), this one has a much stronger feeling of Keith meeting the Scandinavian musicians halfway (rather than Jan, Palle and Jon coming over to play on Keith's turf). It's also less raw, more polished and (with one exception) generally more "commercial" than the first album.There are several true gems on here - the searching album-opener "Questar", the alternately bouncy and longing closer "The Journey Home". "Country" is an absolutely beautiful instrumental pop-jazz ballad, in the same class as Weather Report's "Cannonball" or Herbie Hancock's "Butterfly"."My Song", the other ballad, is really too sweet and cloying for my taste, and showcases Keith's occasional tendency to pour on the syrup a little too thick. And while I like a fair amount of Keith's work in the free-jazz realm, "Mandala" is not his best effort here (compare it to "The Windup" on Belonging, or "Diatribe" on Shades).This is a worthwhile listen for most jazz fans. I would also recommend checking out this group's live albums, Personal Mountains, Nude Ants and Sleeper.

Altoists Sonny Simmons and Prince Lasha are not household names, even in the world of 60s avant-garde jazz. But Firebirds is without a doubt one of the classics of the genre, forgotten and ignored because it wasn't recorded for Blue Note or Impulse.The one bona-fide superstar on Firebirds is vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, whose playing here is terrific and especially loopy. Drummer Charles Moffett (best known for his work with Ornette Coleman's trio) is like a percussive trampoline and Buster Williams rounds out the group with his strong basslines.But Simmons and Lasha are the ones who steal the show; their playing is melodic and joyous, alternating solos with animated dialogues. The music reminds me a little of Ornette's Golden Circle trio, but the playing is generally more "inside" and the vibes give it an Out-to-Lunchish flavor. "Psalms of Solomon" is especially amazing -- Moffett sets up a percolating groove with Lasha on flute and Simmons on English horn, but over 11 minutes it gets increasingly frantic and intense. "The Island Song" is very catchy, and on "Prelude to Bird" the two leaders pay tribute to Mr. Parker. The wild title track lives up to its name and may scare some hard bop fans, though it's quite tame compared to what Coltrane and Cecil Taylor were doing at the time.Firebirds is highly recommended for any fan of freebop and the more melodic side of avant-garde jazz. It's also a lot of fun to listen to.

1957 was the watershed year for John Coltrane -- on earlier recordings with Miles Davis and others, he occasionally sounded tentative or overambitious. But by the time he went into the studio in February '58 to record Soultrane, he had made the transition from being just another hard bop saxophonist to becoming one of the most revolutionary musicians in jazz. He sounds confident and full of fresh ideas on each of the five selections here, his playing has increased in density ("sheets of sound"), and his rhythm section (Red Garland, Paul Chambers, Art Taylor) always swings. The quartet takes Tadd Dameron's "Good Bait" at a bouncy, mid-tempo pace. Coltrane's first recording of Bill Eckstine's "I Want to Talk About You" is also on the record; it's beautiful and respectful but lacks the passionate intensity of later live versions. The album closes out with a moving elegy to alto saxophonist Ernie Henry ("Theme for Ernie") and a torrential version of Irving Berlin's "Russian Lullaby". This isn't a masterpiece on the level of Blue Train, but it is one of Coltrane's best recordings on the Prestige label and features him at the beginning of his "sheets of sound" period. It also provides a nice complement to the classic Milestones album which he recorded at about the same time with the Miles Davis sextet.[This review is based on the K2 20-bit remaster, which had great sound. I have not heard the 2006 reissue. The tracklists are identical.]

This, for my money, is the best of the fusion-oriented Return to Forever albums. Return to Forever and Light as a Feather were, despite the electric piano and the Latin rhythms, still pretty close to what we'd consider straight-ahead jazz. Hymn to the Seventh Galaxy and the next three albums are FUSION - electric music that borrowed pretty heavily from both rock and jazz while not really being either.Over the progression of those four albums RtF would become slicker and more scripted, until they sounded like an instrumental prog rock band on Romantic Warrior. This album is much more raw and punchy (no synthesizers), somewhat reminiscent of the Mahavishnu Orchestra's first few albums. (Those expecting the edginess and fury of Mahavishnu might be disappointed, though.) Though there is plenty of improvisation on this recording, there's a growing focus on intricate and complex ensemble passages rather than the wide-open freedom of Now He Sings Now He Sobs or Tones for Joan's Bones. "Captain Senor Mouse" is one of my favorite Corea tunes. In general, I prefer Bill Connors to the more flashy playing of Al DiMeola.Overall, anybody with an open mind to guitar-oriented fusion will probably enjoy this album. It's no Inner Mounting Flame or Bitches Brew, but offers plenty of enjoyment on its own merits.

One common feature of every Miles Davis group is the stellar rhythm section -- whether it's Garland/Chambers/Jones, Kelly/Chambers/Cobb, or Hancock/Carter/Williams. Yet one of the best Miles rhythm sections, Corea/Holland/DeJohnette, didn't make much of an impact in the studio; while they were absolutely scorching in concert (as any of the Fillmore concerts will attest to), this 2-on-1 CD gives a good idea of what they could do in the studio.Eric Kloss was (and supposedly still is) an edgy post-bop altoist, obviously aware of Coltrane's innovations but with a very distinct, individual sound. On some of the tracks he plays tenor. Anyway, he definitely deserves mention alongside Jackie McLean and Gary Bartz.The first album, To Hear Is To See (tracks 1-5), is relatively more &quot;inside&quot; and it's interesting to hear the rhythm trio swinging in a more conventional setting (one month later they'd be recording Bitches Brew). Like a lot of other jazz cerca 1969-70, there's a definite rock influence both in the rhythms and in Corea's use of the electric piano (he also plays acoustic). Consciousness! (tracks 6-10) was recorded in January 1970, and sounds a lot more like the intense Fillmore recordings. Pat Martino, who joins the band on guitar, is an explosive presence.This is highly recommended to any fan of Corea, Holland, or DeJohnette as well as to anyone who likes the sound of late 60s post-bop jazz. And besides, you will never hear a funkier version of &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; in your life.

I love Keith Jarrett's Impulse recordings with the American "Quartet", but the selection on this compilation is mystifying. Much of his most important, exciting work on the label ("Death and the Flower", "Shades of Jazz", "Inflight") is omitted, instead emphasizing the group's lesser work from their final two albums. Still, there's some great stuff on here -- "The Rich (and the Poor)" is one of their best soul-jazz-influenced tunes, and "Everything That Lives Laments" conjures up mysteries.If you're interested in checking out Jarrett's Impulse work -- and I highly recommend that you do -- you should get either the 5 CD 1973-74 box set or (for a more bite-sized taste) the album Fort Yawuh.

The title track of this album announced to the world (though only a few people were listening) that Miles Davis was back after several years of heroin addiction and erratic playing. Miles had pioneered the cool style four years earlier, but on Walkin' he and his companions went in the opposite direction -- focusing on the groove and the blues in a style that would soon be known as hard bop. On "Walkin'", Kenny Clarke and Percy Heath set up a mid-tempo groove over which Miles blows some incredible trumpet; trombonist J.J. Johnson, pianist Horace Silver, and the underrated saxophonist Lucky Thompson rise to the challenge as well. "Blue'n'Boogie" is given the same treatment but at a much faster pace. On both these numbers, the new LP format allows the musicians to really stretch out and develop their ideas. Side 2 of the album has the same rhythm section, but Johnson and Thompson are replaced with ornithologist Dave Schildkraut. The playing is mellower -- "You Don't Know What Love Is" and the beautiful Davis ballad "Solar" as well as the more energetic "Love Me or Leave Me". Walkin' was the first Miles Davis classic since the Birth of the Cool and is absolutely essential to any fan's collection.[This review is based upon the K2 20-bit version, which has excellent sound. Both versions have identical tracklists.]

This was the first of 6 albums McCoy Tyner recorded for Blue Note records in the late 60s and early 70s. His earlier records for Impulse (Inception, A Night of Ballads and Blues, etc.) were generally more conservative recordings in the piano trio format. But on Real McCoy he went for the explosive, wide open modal sound of the 60s Coltrane quartet.Tyner had played with Elvin Jones for over five years in Coltrane's group and by this point they were joined at the musical hip; as usual, Jones is a polyrhythmic monster on &quot;Passion Dance&quot; and &quot;Four by Five&quot;. Joe Henderson had played in front of Tyner and Jones several times, including the classic quartet date Inner Urge (also on Blue Note); this is among his best playing of the 60s, along with Larry Young's Unity. His mixture of mainstream playing and wild avant-gardisms is on perfect display. Ron Carter provides a strong, flexible anchor. McCoy's playing would get denser and heavier over the next few years, but his powerful sound (dark, left hand chords and fast, unpredictable right hand lines) is well featured here.All five original compositions are classics. Coltrane didn't record many of Tyner's pieces, so the pianist's style as a writer give this album a distinctly different flavor from the Coltrane group despite the Tyner-Jones pairing. &quot;Passion Dance&quot; and &quot;Four by Five&quot; are intense modal workouts, &quot;Contemplation&quot; and &quot;Search for Peace&quot; are haunting ballads, and &quot;Blues on the Corner&quot; sounds just like the title.The Real McCoy isn't as intense as some of his early 70s recordings for Milestone records (Sahara, Enlightenment) but it sets the tone for them. With the possible exception of Extensions with Wayne Shorter and Gary Bartz, it is the best of his Blue Note albums. If you like the more intense, wild moments of the '63-'64 Coltrane quartet, the Real McCoy is essential.

This is the first in a line of many recordings by the Cannonball Adderley quintet and pretty much sets the pace for the rest of them -- populist jazz, intelligent and modern but also accessible to a broad audience. It's not necessarily the best one, but it's not a bad place to start and few fans of hard bop will be disappointed.The big hit -- which set the tone for later tunes like "Sack'o'Woe" and "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy" -- is Bobby Timmons's gospel-infused "This Here". Again, it's not necessarily the group's best performance in this style, but it is very good. (It's also an interesting contrast to Mingus's "Better Git It in Your Soul" and "Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting".)The rest of the tunes are not as overtly funky. "Hi Fly" is probably the most famous version of the tune, and it's amusing to hear composer Randy Weston described as a waltz specialist. "Bohemia After Dark" and "Straight No Chaser" show the quintet could bebop with the best of 'em.If you like this one, jump ahead to 1960's recording at the Lighthouse and 1962's Live in Europe. Both will showcase how the band evolved (and improved) over the next few years.

Until they hit it big with Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd was a prolific band, cranking out at least one album every year. But it took a long time -- two and a half years -- before they released a sequel to their surprise smash hit.After Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd's music began to change. Roger Waters took over all lyric writing. The music itself became less of a collaborative effort - Nick Mason stopped contributing, followed by Rick Wright and eventually David Gilmour. The experimental edge that Floyd had in their early days was already fading fast, and disappeared completely by the late 1970s to be replaced by a more radio-friendly format. And the group's sound began to change, with the gritty and rough sound present on Meddle and Dark Side becoming more slick and clean.That transition was still in its early stages. Waters's lyrics, while cynical at points, do not yet have the extreme bitterness present on ensuing albums; indeed, his tributes to Syd Barrett on "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" and "Wish You Were Here" show a side to his writing that would recede in a few years.Both halves of "Shine on" -- the album's highlights, despite receiving less airplay than the middle 3 songs -- showcase the power of the Rick Wright/Roger Waters/David Gilmour team. It would be the last time those three names would share composer credit, in my opinion to the detriment of the music. Rick Wright's substantial contributions to Floyd's music were sharply curtailed after this album. Musically each does his bit as well - Wright's keyboard playing, particularly in Part I and in Part IX, is among his finest with the band; Gilmour's biting, passionate guitar solos, are among those that created his reputation; and Waters's singing, which is more assertive and rich than on earlier albums but without the narrow emotional and tonal range of later work.The other three songs provide a nice interlude. The synth-heavy "Welcome to the Machine" and "Have a Cigar" rail against the musical industry, one grim and the other cynically humorous. "Wish You Were Here", despite being interpreted by many as a love song, is really just a heartfelt tribute to their former colleague; the combination of Waters's lyrics and Gilmour's rough voice completely avoids the schmaltzy blandness of later live versions.Highly recommended. Dark Side may or may not be better overall, but to this listener Wish You Were Here is the more meaningful album.

This CD includes all of Roy's official live recordings with this group; the compilation Dear Old Stockholm has the studio recordings. Your assessment of Newport '63 will come down to one thing - how do you feel about Roy Haynes replacing Elvin Jones in John Coltrane's Classic Quartet? Personally, while I love Roy in most other contexts, I'm so used to Elvin's sound that I find the change jarring, particularly in "My Favorite Things" and "I Want to Talk About You". He fits in much better on "Impressions". It's enough to keep me from putting this in the very top tier of live Coltrane performances. People who are not bothered may very well think he puts one heck of a performance.John, McCoy and Jimmy certainly do. Their performances are on par with Live at Birdland and Live at the Vanguard. In fact, unlike the Vanguard 1961 recordings, this is a much tighter group. "Impressions" is a particularly smoking performance, featuring John and Roy duetting as the rest of the band drops out, and "I Want to Talk About You" is a phenomenal read of this tune. This version of "My Favorite Things" is frequently mentioned as the best. I'm not so sure, and wonder if at least some of the praise comes from it being the best KNOWN live version; certainly it doesn't tower over the excellent 1961-63 live recordings from Europe. But it is a great version, with a lot more intensity and abstraction than the (also great) 1960 studio version.The bonus track is "Chasin' Another Trane", from the 1961 Village Vanguard engagement. It's excellent, if not nearly at the same level as the more famous "Chasin the Trane". You do get some fine Dolphy alto sax playing on here.As far as alternative purchase options - note that Impulse/Verve now has a CD titled "My Favorite Things: Coltrane at Newport" combining the 1963 and 1965 Newport performances. It restores some edited parts of "Impressions". "Chasin' Another Trane" is available on the Complete Vanguard box.

Whew. Even by the standards of 1965 Coltrane, this is an extreme recording. The Classic Quartet is augmented by two individuals here; tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and bassist/bass clarinetist Donald Garrett. That means that if you don't like the horn conversations of Ascension and Meditations, you should steer far away from Live in Seattle. But if you do, this 2 CD set may be to your liking. &quot;Cosmos&quot; starts out like something from the Sun Ship sessions, but once the other horns join to comment behind Coltrane's burning solo, the music builds to an almost excruciating intensity. Another highlight is the completely over-the-top &quot;Evolution&quot;, which in its 36 minutes encompasses everything from a dissonant tri-horn collective improv to a fiery Pharoah Sanders solo to chants (OHM! OHM! OHM!) to a great McCoy Tyner solo. It's also interesting to hear the sextet tackle three standards Coltrane did earlier in the decade (&quot;Afro Blue&quot;, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, &quot;Out of This World&quot;), though none of the renditions is a classic. Perhaps the biggest complaint with this release is that the relative lack of Coltrane's playing (Sanders actually solos more than Trane does). At any rate, if you like Ascension and Meditations and are willing to tread into even more turbulent waters, Live in Seattle awaits.

It's hard to believe that these vital recordings were basically hidden in a closet for three decades. These eight pieces, three of which have alternate takes, feature Coltrane's last working unit -- a quartet with Alice Coltrane, Jimmy Garrison, and Rashied Ali. (Pharoah Sanders was also a member of the group, but does not appear here.) Unlike the marathon '66 live recordings, each piece is below the 9 minute mark.Novices beware: this music is firmly in free jazz territory. The music is definitely calmer than that of the '65 Classic Quartet. Rashied and Alice provide a much mellower, though less predictable, backdrop to Trane's explorations than McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones did. Alice plays the piano with a tonally ambiguous, floating sound; Rashied provides a panrhythmic cushion. Trane's playing is even more abstract than it was in '65, but in terms of technical command he was at the peak of his game.Most of the music is of a meditative nature -- Trane plays an incantatory melody over floating rhythm, then goes wherever he wants. &quot;Seraphic Light&quot;, &quot;Sun Star&quot;, and &quot;Stellar Regions&quot; are incredibly beautiful. &quot;Configuration&quot; and &quot;Tranesonic&quot; (one of the few tracks where Trane played an alto sax) feature fiercer playing with some incredible (or horrifying), intense playing.If you're interested in John Coltrane's 1967 music (&quot;very late Coltrane&quot;) you should probably start with Interstellar Space, which features just saxophone-drum duets. This is an excellent second choice. Afterwards check out the monumental Olatunji Concert and the slightly less exciting Expression, which features the same performance of &quot;Offering&quot; as on Stellar Regions.

John Coltrane was one of the greatest ballad players in jazz so it's not surprising that he would do an album of all ballads. But oddly enough, I don't think I'd consider any of these songs to be among his classic ballad performances -- they aren't in the same class as Ogunde, After the Rain, I Want to Talk About You, Naima or Blue in Green. The Quartet approaches these eight standards very respectfully, with most taken at a slow tempo. Maybe the approach is too conservative, because the band sounds too restrained on some of the cuts and the short time span (most tunes are between 3 and 5 minutes) limits the scope of the improvisations. Trane really holds back, keeping the emotional range of the music a little too narrow for my liking. A plus is that Coltrane and Jones's relative restraint give more space to McCoy Tyner's piano. I don't know if I'd call this an ideal introduction to Coltrane's music; some people may love Ballads but hate his more exploratory albums post-1960, while others may like the more intense stuff and find this one too tame. (A good combination of mood and more intense playing is 1964's Crescent.) But in the end, you can't really argue with Coltrane's beautiful tone playing eight pretty melodies.

Sun Ship is one of my favorite &quot;late&quot; Coltrane albums; this was among the last recordings made by the Classic Quartet, and strikes just the perfect balance between the burning intensity and expressionism of Ascension and the modality of earlier recordings. Coltrane's mastery over the tenor saxophone is complete here, screaming and honking with ferocity as the thundering rhythm section of Tyner and Jones pushes him forward and upward on &quot;Sun Ship&quot; (the agitated, tense theme of this tune is awesome) and &quot;Amen&quot;. The prayer-like ballads, &quot;Attaining&quot; and &quot;Dearly Beloved&quot;, are just as volcanic. And the closer, &quot;Ascent&quot;, features a lengthy (but not over-long) bass solo which sets up Coltrane's entrance perfectly as he proceeds to launch into the stratosphere. This is heady music, and not for the faint at heart; but those who like A Love Supreme will find a lot of touchstones here, and some of the other factors that turn people off from late Coltrane (Pharaoh Sanders, the horn dialogues) are absent. There's just the classic four here, taking the Quartet format as far as it will go. This and the John Coltrane Quartet Plays are perfect intros to this period in Trane's music. Absolutely essential to any Coltrane collection!

It may not have the overt spirituality of A Love Supreme, but Live at Birdland is one of the greatest recordings by the Classic Quartet. The performances of &quot;Afro Blue&quot; and &quot;I Want to Talk About You&quot;, two live staples in this phase of Coltrane's career, are arguably the best on record. &quot;Afro Blue&quot; has an outstanding McCoy Tyner piano solo, while Elvin Jones thunders underneath; and when Trane comes in with that unearthly cry on soprano, Elvin EXPLODES (well, not literally - this isn't Spinal Tap). &quot;I Want to Talk About You&quot; has Trane turning the old Billy Eckstine ballad inside out, and then wrapping the performance up with an unaccompanied coda of sublime intensity. The third live tune, &quot;The Promise&quot;, isn't as well known but equals the other two in quality. The album closes out with two more sedate studio tunes; the free-time ballad &quot;Alabama&quot; is a solemn meditation on then-recent church bombings, while &quot;Your Lady&quot; is a melodic romp as the JC Quartet knows best. Finally, there's a bonus track (&quot;Vilia&quot;) which is not quite as great as the original album, but who's going to complain about additional material? This is one of the essential John Coltrane albums and not a bad place to start exploring his music.

This 4 CD box set contains the final four albums Keith Jarrett's American &quot;Quartet&quot; (Jarrett, Charlie Haden, Dewey Redman, Paul Motian and the occasional percussionist) recorded for the Impulse label: Shades, Mysteries, Byablue and Bop-Be. Though they don't reflect the wild eclecticism of the group's first four Impulse albums (available on the 1973-74 Impulse Years box set), this is still some of the best post-bop jazz recorded in the 1970s. There are lots of alternate takes, offering a different perspective on certain tunes (or an excuse to press the Skip button).Shades and Mysteries have a similar modus operandi to the band's previous album, Backhand. &quot;Southern Smiles&quot; is a funky boogaloo, &quot;Rose Petals&quot; is a ballad, &quot;Shades of Jazz&quot; is a post-bop swinger, and the group reasserts its Ornette roots with the spiky &quot;Diatribe&quot;. Mysteries (disc 2) evokes a strong Coltrane sound (cerca Crescent), especially on the title track and both takes of &quot;Everything that Lives Laments&quot;. &quot;Flame&quot; is another of the group's exotic reed-and-percussion pieces.Byablue and Bop-Be are outliers in the group's career -- most of the tunes were contributed by Redman, Haden, and Motian. (Jarrett wrote 95% of the music on previous albums.) Byablue centers on Motian's floating, abstract compositions; it's difficult to connect with some of this music. Bop-Be is more accessible; Jarrett contributes &quot;Bop-Be&quot; (which looks ahead to his work with the Standards Trio), Dewey Redman offers the catchy &quot;Gotta Get Some Sleep&quot; and &quot;Mushi Mushi&quot;, and Charlie Haden steals the show with the beautiful ballad &quot;Silence&quot; and the tribute &quot;A Pocketful of Cherry&quot;.Overall this box is not as essential as the 1973-74 set, but it does offer a nice complement and rounds out the group's Impulse catalogue. Anyone who likes this group's other work is certain to be pleased.

Sandwiched between two of the John Coltrane Quartet's greatest masterpieces -- Live at Birdland and A Love Supreme -- Crescent is often forgotten. But this album of four ballads and one blues is full of understated beauty. &quot;Crescent&quot;, &quot;The Wise One&quot; and &quot;Lonnie's Lament&quot; are three of the Coltrane's most beautiful compositions; these are some of the first ballads in the later Coltrane style, with the saxophone playing the theme in free time over the rumbling rhythm section. (There's a great 50 minute performance of &quot;Crescent&quot; on Live in Japan, but that's not for everyone.) The mood on this recording is similar to that on Ballads but Coltrane cuts loose a bit more. His playing can get intense at times, but it doesn't have the shrieks and screams which pop up on A Love Supreme and later albums. &quot;The Drum Thing&quot; is basically an excellent Elvin Jones solo, with Jimmy Garrison's bass providing forward motion and Trane's saxophone wrapping around the rhythm section. If you liked A Love Supreme, this is an excellent choice for your next Coltrane album.

There are three versions of this album on the market - a 1997 1-disc reissue, a 2002 2-disc deluxe version, and a more recent 1-disc reissue from 2008. I haven't AB'd them for sound, so if that would sway your decision I'd take my review with a grain of salt; my comment is only on the musical content. I will say the 1997 reissue sounds great to me, though I only listen to it on a mid-range system.The 2008 disc (part of the Verve/Impulse Originals series) is probably the worst choice you can make unless you are absolutely dead-set against bonus tracks. Unlike the 1997 reissue, it excludes "Big Nick" (which is available on the Quartet Studio Recordings box, but nowhere else) and the brief but excellent blues "Up Against the Wall" (which is available on the album Impressions).The 2002 2-disc deluxe version runs into the opposite problem - an excess of alternate takes. I don't mind hearing alternate versions when they offer something sufficiently different (for example, on the Village Vanguard box), but here it's just too much for most people who are not Coltrane scholars. It is interesting to follow the development of the tune into its final version, if you're interested in that sort of thing. In a monumental screwup, Impulse also substituted "Big Nick" from the later session with Duke Ellington for the version that is available on the 1997 issue - so you'll need to buy that tune separately if you want to hear it. That said, the 2-disc version does include the only known Coltrane studio recordings of "Not Yet" (an unremarkable Tyner soul jazz tune) and "Impressions".In conclusion, I'd recommend the 1997 reissue for most listeners. This was the first recording to feature Coltrane's quartet with Jimmy Garrison without any other musicians; they almost instantly had very strong chemistry. "Out of This World" is one of the best things Coltrane ever recorded - that rolling Classic Quartet groove with some very intense Coltrane tenor. It's probably in my Coltrane top 10. "Soul Eyes", the Mal Waldron ballad, gets a lovely intimate reading that falls just short of the top tier of Coltrane ballad performances; "Tunji" is a nice, enigmatic minor blues with echoes of "Equinox". The other two tunes are a bit of a drag - "Miles's Mode" gets a much limper reading than it did live, and "Inch Worm" is just annoying. (Though Coltrane was able to make something worthwhile out of it live.)Overall, this is an album that's worth hearing - but as far as classic quartet recordings, I would definitely put Live at Birdland, Crescent, A Love Supreme, and Sun Ship above it. Still, you absolutely must acquire "Out of This World" by hook or by crook. And don't buy the 2008 reissue.

This album is the tamest of Coltrane's post-A Love Supreme recordings. There are a few hints of what's to come, but most people who enjoy Crescent and ALS will probably like this one too. Coltrane's playing is certainly denser than it was on Crescent and the playing more abstract, but a lot of the more difficult and abrasive parts of his playing which would emerge just a few weeks later are less prominent here."Chim Chim Cheree" is the last in a series of soprano waltzes that Coltrane recorded with the quartet in the studio. Whereas "My Favorite Things", "Greensleeves" and "Afro Blue" got a melodic, upbeat tinge, this performance is very dark and unsettling. I'd describe it as the weakest link on the album, and maybe Coltrane did too because he never tried this kind of thing again. There's an interesting live unofficial recording of this from a few months earlier at the Half Note."Brasilia" was not new to Coltrane - he is also recorded a version in 1961 at the Village Vanguard. This version is, in my opinion, stronger. We get some very intense playing out of Trane and Elvin, particularly at the end. It's probably the strongest performance on the album."Nature Boy" is another intense, unsettling performance - this time with Art Davis added as a second bass player. His bowed playing as a counterpoint to Trane's tenor near the end is a highlight.The album closes with "Song of Praise", which is very similar stylistically to A Love Supreme's "Psalm". If you like one, you'll like the other. A more intense version was recorded at the Half Note and appears on the 2-disc One Up One Down set released by Verve/Impulse, but this version is great.If you like this album and want to see where Coltrane went next, I'd check out Transition or Living Space. They're more edgy than this album, but it's not a huge step forward. After those, you can tackle Sun Ship and Ascension.One final note: apparently there are two versions floating around, one with 7 tracks and one with 4 tracks. Though the 3 bonus tracks on the 7-track version are not absolutely essential, they are worthwhile and most Coltrane fans picking up this album will want to hear them.

Though it never achieved the popularity of the Standards Trio, the European Quartet, or his solo performances, Keith Jarrett's American "Quartet" was one of his most exciting groups. Jarrett, tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Paul Motian were all strong musical personalities, but the creative tension they generated was conducive to some great music that "thought outside the box". It tied together a wide array of seemingly incompatible strands in modern jazz: the loose, quirky free-bop of Ornette Coleman ("Misfits", "Angles"), the romantic lyricism and harmonic richness of Bill Evans ("Still Life, Still Life", "Prayer"), and the groovy, gospel-infused soul jazz of Bobby Timmons and Cannonball Adderley ("De Drums", "Le Mistral"). It also drew on traditions outside jazz: Asian and African music ("Roads Travelled, Roads Veiled", "Kuum"), 20th century classical, and even hints of rock'n'roll ("Treasure Island"). And when the Quartet was not satisfied with the traditional jazz instruments, they tried others: Jarrett played soprano sax, Redman played a Chinese musette, and every member of the group played odd percussion. (The group usually included one or two additional percussionists.)Though the group also recorded for Atlantic, Columbia and ECM, the bulk of their work was done on the Impulse label. This box set packages the first four Impulse albums (Fort Yawuh, Treasure Island, Death and the Flower, and Backhand) on 5 CDs; each album showcases a different facet of the band's personality. Conveniently for LP-philes, the albums are presented on separate discs by initial running order (rather than chronologically, by session). The packaging is nice and compact -- a double jewel case holds all 5 CDs and fits into a neat slipcase.Fort Yawuh, on the first two CDs, lets the group stretch out live at the Village Vanguard -- most of the tunes are between 10 and 20 minutes. Treasure Island (disc 3) is the most accessible and rock-influenced; most of the tunes have strong backbeats and two tracks feature electric guitar. Death and the Flower is more reflective and revolves around the magnificent, organic group improvisation of the title track. Disc 5, Backhand, showcases the band at its jazziest; this may be my favorite album by the group.Since at most 2 of the albums are currently available domestically (Death and the Flower may be going out of print), this box set is probably the best investment for someone interested in this music. It is probably less expensive than the four albums would be individually. At any rate, any fan of Jarrett or post-bop jazz should hear this music is some form. People who like this set should also check out the classic "Survivor's Suite" (on ECM) and the 4 CD set of 1975-76 Impulse material titled "Mysteries".

John Coltrane was no stranger to controversy when he and his quintet arrived at New York's Village Vanguard in 1961; but the controversy that this extremely radical music aroused among jazz audiences, may have been a shock. Critics, including those who a year or two earlier had championed Giant Steps and My Favorite Things, now derided the music as anti-jazz or worse. Granted, this is some of Coltrane's most challenging pre-1965 music; but it is also music filled with incredible invention and joy, music that every open-minded jazz fan should check out. There's &quot;Chasing the Trane&quot; from November 2, where Coltrane pretty much deconstructs the saxophone with honks, whoops, and screams but never quite forgets the joyful, singsong melody; the unforgettable duet between Coltrane and drummer Elvin Jones on the November 3 &quot;Impressions&quot;; and &quot;Softly as in a Morning Sunrise&quot;, which features the classic Coltrane quartet and is an interesting comparison to the version that Sonny Rollins recorded four years earlier at the same venue. McCoy Tyner plays wonderful piano on &quot;Greensleeves&quot; and &quot;Softly...&quot;; Elvin Jones is, as usual, superhuman. Eric Dolphy plays some of his finest music, with his vocal style on bass clarinet and alto sax -- from his anguish on both takes of &quot;Naima&quot; to the modal musings of &quot;India&quot;. And yeah, several of the tracks are repeated, but each one is a universe to itself. There's really no excuse for not owning this incredible box set, a milestone in jazz and 20th century music.

Out of John Coltrane's four most popular albums (the others being Giant Steps, My Favorite Things and A Love Supreme), Blue Train is easily the most straightforward and traditional. Giant Steps pushes the language of bebop about as far as it can go, My Favorite Things lays down the foundation for Coltrane's modal explorations, and A Love Supreme is an early step into his final free jazz phase. Blue Trane, on the other hand, is comfortably within the hard bop mainstream - and on the premiere hard bop label of the 1950s, Blue Note.Blue Trane was recorded about 2 years after Trane caught his big break and joined Miles Davis's quintet. A lot of those early 1955 and 1956 recordings show Coltrane struggling - whether with his substance abuse problems or with articulating his challenging ideas, I'm not sure. But after kicking heroin in May of 1957, his playing and composition began to evolve by leaps and bounds. He joined Thelonious Monk for a legendary gig at the Five Spot, and began recording a series of fine albums under his own name for the Prestige label. (The first one, titled Coltrane, was recorded about 4 months before this one.) His playing was growing so rapidly, and he was recording so frequently, that you can hear the change even across recordings just a few weeks apart.Prestige and Blue Note had very different recording styles, and you can hear it here. Prestige was about loose recording sessions with minimum preparation; Blue Note was about practice, rehearsal and creating a polished product. While both approaches have their strengths, in this case Blue Train is well above its Prestige counterparts. Not only does it perfectly showcase Coltrane's playing (both its power and its delicacy), but it's the first album to really focus on his compositional skills. Aside from a beautiful ballad performance of "I'm Old Fashioned", all of the tunes are Coltrane originals. The title track, a minor blues, might be the most striking, but they are all strong.The sidemen play very well. Lee Morgan was at an early peak here; while his playing doesn't have the depth it would acquire in the mid-to-late 60s, he plays with plenty of explosive fire here. The rhythm duo of Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones show why they were in such high demand during this period.I don't know whether this is the best Trane intro; as a fan of classic and progressive rock, the more exploratory A Love Supreme and Live at Birdland clicked instantly while Blue Train seemed somewhat ordinary at first. But those whose tastes lean primarily toward mainstream 50s jazz like Kind of Blue, Getz/Gilberto and Time Out should probably start here. Also, fans of this album should check out Sonny Clark's album Sonny's Crib which has a very similar lineup.

May 1967 was the beginning of an amazing burst of studio creativity for Miles Davis; the first recordings in that burst are on this album. Sorcerer is even darker and moodier than its predecessor, Miles Smiles. (And even for a Miles Davis album, this is very moody and very dark.) It features less memorable tunes but the improvisations go even further away from the jazz mainstream. &quot;Masqualero&quot;, a Wayne Shorter tune, is essentially an anything-goes performance with a Spanish tinge; there's a lot of fireworks in Miles's solo as the rhythm section rumbles under him, and Herbie Hancock's solo is a textbook example of tension and release. Another one of Shorter's compositions, &quot;Vonetta&quot;, takes a quirky ballad and marries it to martial drumming by Tony Williams. There's also &quot;Pee Wee&quot;, a Williams ballad with some beautiful playing. The other three tunes are similar -- haunting, dreamy themes coupled with complex group interaction. &quot;Nothing Like You&quot; is an odd vocal tune, a leftover from Gil Evans/Miles Davis sessions five years later that offers a bit of comic relief after the ominous music that precedes it; and two alternate takes (&quot;Masqualero&quot; and &quot;Limbo&quot;) round out the album. If you like Miles Smiles and E.S.P., this is essential. But try those albums first.

Miles in the Sky was the fifth studio album by Miles Davis's 2nd great quintet. For most listeners, it was the first taste of the trumpeter's experiments in fusing jazz with popular music: one of the tunes features George Benson's electric guitar, another has Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter on electric piano and electric bass, and two of the tunes use funky boogaloo rhythms. (Some earlier recordings with electric instruments remained in the can until the late 70s.) Aside from changes in instrumentation and rhythm, Miles resumed composing the bulk of the music. He also led the group away from exploratory but self-contained performances like "Masqualero" and "Footprints" to longer open-ended jams. At the same time, Miles refused to offer any concessions on the group's adventurous slant -- this album has plenty of intense solos by both him and Wayne as well as Tony Williams's unpredictable (and loud) drumming.The two more conventional tunes on this album are "Black Comedy" and "Paraphernalia". The former is a rhythmic tongue-twister composed by Tony Williams, and could have easily fit in on Nefertiti or Sorcerer. "Paraphernalia" (a Shorter tune) has a briskly swinging groove, and while the solos are typically adventurous the rhythmic "space" of earlier albums is mostly gone. Benson's solo and comping on this tune are alright, though he sounds a little lost at times."Country Son" isn't really a tune; it just cycles episodically through three different rhythmic styles -- swinging, ballad, boogaloo -- during the solos, looking ahead to compositions like "[...]" and "It's About That Time". It has some terrific funky playing by Herbie. "Stuff" is a funky boogaloo strut, with Herbie and Ron laying down the groove emphatically on their electric instruments while Tony tries to break free.For whatever reason, I don't like this album as much as the other ones recorded by the group. The performances are exciting (with this group, how could they not be?), but the music isn't as compelling as either the quintet's earlier albums or Davis's later visionary experiments with fusion. The next and final quintet album, Filles de Kilimanjaro, would integrate the ideas on this album and execute them much more effectively.[This review is based on the 1998 reissue, which had excellent sound and an identical tracklist.]

Miles Smiles is the second album by the second Great Quintet. The consensus is also that it's the best of that quintet's 6 studio albums; I can't disagree. It starts where its predecessor, E.S.P., left off but delves even further into abstraction and exploration. Fans of the trumpeter's 50s recordings may find this album's abstraction forbidding even if it doesn't feature the outright dissonance of 60s free jazz. Though none of the tunes ever abandon a central pulse, the actual meter and rhythm are always ambiguous; and Herbie Hancock's sparse or nonexistent comping during Davis and Shorter's solos frees up the harmony and lets the soloists play whatever they want. The relative absence of the piano also contributes to the dry, skeletal sound of the album. Shorter thrives in this setting, whereas Miles provides some of the most exciting, virtuosic playing of his career. And the 19 year old Tony Williams is a monster on the drums; you may never hear better drumming elsewhere. The performances are all classics. &quot;Orbits&quot; links a memorable tune to unfettered improvisation. &quot;Circle&quot; is an abstraction of the classic Miles ballad sound and features one of the greatest piano solos of all time -- anybody who's heard this album with agree. &quot;Footprints&quot; is an unforgettable, mysterious Wayne Shorter composition with a probing, masterful solo by Miles and some spiky, Taylor-esque chording by Hancock. Williams is fully on charge on that one, with Ron Carter's elastic bass playing holding the band together. &quot;Dolores&quot; is another catchy Shorter composition, and the album closes with two masterful deconstructions of jazz standards. These definitive takes of Eddie Harris's &quot;Freedom Jazz Dance&quot; and Jimmy Heath's &quot;Gingerbread Boy&quot; completely reinvent the tunes. Miles Smiles is easily in a 60s jazz top ten; its cerebral beauty is *that* compelling.

Bob Dylan has created enough classic albums that any debate over &quot;the best one&quot; is likely to be an exercise in futility. But as far as creating its own sonic universe, no other Dylan album comes close to Blonde on Blonde.There's no unifying theme to the lyrics. Dylan's imagination runs free. The musical styles on this album run the gamut from blues, to pop songs, to good old folk-rock. And the mood ranges from blustery, to whimsical, to reflective, to melancholy. Yet despite this wild eclecticism, every second of music on this album seems to flow from the same source.It's pointless to discuss the songs individually. Most people have heard &quot;Rainy Day Women&quot; and &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;, but nearly all of the tunes are masterpieces even if they don't seem like it at first. &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot; is a masterpiece among masterpieces, a perfect finale to an album, one of Dylan's most majestic and moving compositions.You can put this disc in your player, dim the lights and during the span of 70 minutes Dylan and his fellow musicians take you on a journey through this universe. And with each additional journey, you find another amazing spot in that universe that you never noticed before.

When I first got this CD, I didn't really get it; it was nice, groovy, with a real blues feeling, but it didn't blow me away. I went on and bought some of Miles's later works, and then about two years later came back to this one. It knocked me flat. On his spare yet melodic solo on &quot;So What&quot;, Miles says more than most trumpeters say during their entire careers. And Coltrane: I love all his stuff, from the first recordings with Miles all the way up to Interstellar Space, but his playing here may be the best of his career. His dense solos push and pull at the rhythm section but never to the detriment of the music. Cannonball's jubilant, swinging playing on the alto is an effective foil to the other two horn players. Bill Evans's enigmatic, abstract piano playing is often overlooked but is absolutely essential to the album. The tunes are just as great as the musicians -- &quot;So What&quot;, &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; (where Wynton Kelly subs for Evans and shows what bluesy, funky playing is all about) merge improvisational perfection with effortless swinging. The ballads are a little more obscure, but just as rewarding; even for Miles and Coltrane, two of the greatest ballad players in jazz, these are landmark performances. &quot;Blue in Green&quot; is [forgive the cheesy simile] like a placid lake at sunset (Evans really shines here), while &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; conjures up a mood of utter solemnity. Even if this album doesn't hit you immediately, give it another shot. There are always more wonderful nuances to be discovered. Kind of Blue is the perfect gateway into jazz music.

This isn't the "first fusion album". This wasn't Miles Davis's first recording with electric keyboards or, for that matter, the electric guitar. He'd been experimenting with rock, soul and pop rhythms for over a year. And yet In a Silent Way really is a first. It's the first Davis album in a new, undefined style -- informed heavily by jazz, but already heading somewhere else.It's also the last Tony Williams appearance on a Davis album. Supposedly Williams, who was starting Lifetime with organist Larry Young and guitarist John McLaughlin, was angry and paranoid at the thought of Miles poaching his star guitarist. So for most of the CD, he plays a very repetitive rhythm -- hi hat on the first half, snare on the second - except for one brief moment, which I'll get back to shortly.McLaughlin isn't the firebrand of the Mahavishnu Orchestra or Jack Johnson; his playing is very circumspect and cautious, blending in very well with the triple-keyboard stew of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock and Joe Zawinul. Dave Holland grooves along with those funky basslines he's so good at producing. It's a testament to these great musicians that they constantly manage to keep things interesting in a fairly repetitive setting and never get in each other's way. Aside from a few collective improvisations by the rhythm section, the only soloists on this CD are Miles, Wayne Shorter (playing lovely, snaking lines on the soprano), and John McLaughlin.The music, like many of the recordings Miles would make over the next six years, consists of lengthy medleys over funky vamps. In each, the first five minutes are repeated via splicing at the end. That kind of repetition would be irritating in other contexts, but here it's extremely effective. "Shhh/Peaceful" is one of those pieces doesn't really go anywhere but offering a fun ride as it motors along; it can work as background, and yet teems with detail for the attentive listener. "In a Silent Way", Miles's striking interpretation of Zawinul's tune, is one of the most striking pieces of music in jazz history; first John McLaughlin tentatively stating the theme, next Wayne coming in on soprano, and finally Miles stepping in. Beautiful. Then the lightly funky groove of "It's About That Time" comes in. It slowly rises in intensity during John and Wayne's solo turns, setting up Miles for some of the best (and seemingly effortless) playing of his career. He paces the notes perfectly, and then when Tony Williams finally cuts loose... well, if you've heard it, you know it's one of the most exhilirating things ever set to tape. The repeat of the title track brings the album to a perfect close -- a return to motionless silence.A lot of people associate Miles's electric music with lengthy, amelodic jams. And while some of it really is like that, those wary of albums like Bitches Brew and Pangaea might still like the subtle, melodic beauty of In a Silent Way. In fact, I think that this album contains the seeds to unlocking the mystery of those wonderful but difficult recordings. Try it out -- I think you'll like it.

On this album, Rush showed a maturation of their progressive rock style. There are a few shorter songs (including their first AOR hit, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;) but the meat of the album really lies in the longer pieces: &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot;. The latter in particular is fantastic, one of Rush's all-time classics. The title track is also wonderful and one of the band's most underrated tunes; the start-stop middle section may grate on some, but if you aren't bothered by Geddy's screeching on &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; then it shoudl be of no consequence. This is an album well worth picking up.

King Crimson went on the road in 1971 for the first time in almost two years; they'd been a Robert Fripp studio project for the previous two albums, but the Crimson that recorded Islands was a BAND. Granted, the band's limitations become obvious quickly; Islands is probably the weakest King Crimson album, at least before the 90s, with snippets of good material lost in boredom. The tunes themselves aren't very good, and the band lacks the instrumental pyrotechnics to overcome that hurdle. Plus, Boz Burrell's vocals are poor qaulity. The album starts out slowly with "Fromentera Lady", but the song improves after the main melody starts. Mel Collins's saxophone and the female soprano intertwine nicely here, before the track segues into the "Sailor's Tale". This one really cooks; Collins does his best Pharoah Sanders imitation over the jazzy groove, and then Fripp comes in with a noisy, detuned-banjo type solo that needs to be heard. After almost 20 minutes, you can probably press STOP on your CD player, because the rest of the album isn't very good. "Ladies of the Road" is a tune with potential that gets a little lost (the Beatles-esque harmonies are beautiful and the raunch of Pete Sinfield's tribute to groupies is amusing -- don't see many groupies in Crimson concerts nowadays), "Prelude: Song of the Gulls" is pleasant quasi-classical filler, and "Islands" will put you to sleep with its length (nice cornet solo, though). I can't find anything good to say about "The Letters". Anyway, Islands is for completists; after touring for this album, Fripp would break up this lineup and put together a much stronger group.

In the hit-and-miss world of early 70s King Crimson, Lizard is a hit; unlike the unoriginal Poseidon and the pedestrian Islands, it's a surprisingly strong record by a band that never really managed to get its act together until 1973. Gordon Haskell's unconventional vocals are usually a prime target for ridicule, but they fit this album reall well. Haskell sounds much better than Boz Burrell and even Greg Lake's prog melodramatics grow old after a while. The cool thing about Lizard is that it's so damn strange -- there's no other King Crimson album that even tries to match its mutant mix of jazz, rock, and classical. The band even tries to tackle the super-cliche of progressive rock, a 20 minute epic suite with Jon Anderson of Yes on vocals, and manages to turn the cliches inside out. How many other prog epics have a Bolero section with dissonant multi-horn improvisation? Side one has four shorter pieces. "Happy Family" gets slammed a lot, but Gordon Haskell's manic, processed vocals, Pete Sinfield's obscure lyrics and the schizophrenic free jazz blowing make a great combination. One of Crimson's best tunes ever. Add that to "Cirkus", "Lady of the Dancing Water" (some beautiful flute on that one), and the Anglo-funk from Pluto of "Indoor Games", and you've got a great batch of music.[This review is based on the 2000 reissue, which has perfectly good sound quality.]

Coltrane's Sound was recorded at the same October 1960 sessions as My Favorite Things. (Coltrane Plays the Blues also comes from these sessions.) Though it has never achieved the same popularity as MFT, in my opinion Coltrane's Sound is actually a better album! It comes from a period where Coltrane finally got a working band (McCoy Tyner, Steve Davis, Elvin Jones) together and was shifting direction away from the harmonic density of Giant Steps and &quot;sheets of sound&quot; toward modal improvisation and more open structures.Coltrane was experimenting with a bunch of approaches around this time, making variety one of this album's strengths. He plays soprano saxophone on the beautiful ballad &quot;Central Park West&quot; (pretty rare for him -- he usually played ballads on the tenor). &quot;Satellite&quot; is a piano-less trio tune. &quot;Night of a Thousand Eyes&quot; and &quot;Liberia&quot; are explosive workouts which already showcase Coltrane's powerful tenor playing and his special relationship with Elvin Jones. &quot;Equinox&quot; has him digging deep, deep into the blues -- some of Coltrane's finest, most powerful blues playing this side of &quot;Chasin' the Trane&quot;. Throughout this album, his playing is overflowing with ideas.The Atlantic recordings contain some of John Coltrane's best, most accessible, and most focused music. If you've already heard Giant Steps and My Favorite Things (or if you haven't), don't hesitate to pick up Coltrane's Sound.

If you happen to catch the Paul Motian/Bill Frisell/Joe Lovano trio in concert, it's a near-certainty that you'll hear them play a Monk tune or two. Motian's trio and quintet had recorded a few Monk tunes on their previous albums (One Time Out, Misterioso) so an only-Monk album made a lot of sense. The basic trio of Motian, Frisell and Lovano is augmented by pianist Geri Allen and tenor saxophonist Dewey Redman on two tracks apiece. It's interesting to hear Allen interacting with the trio -- this is the only one of their albums to include any piano. Redman was a big influence on Lovano, so it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between them.Unlike the On Broadway albums, the tunes here are taken relatively "straight" -- that is, except for the screaming electric guitar and the lack of a bass. It's fun to hear Monk tackled in this way. Aside from the ballad "Ugly Beauty", most of the tunes are fairly well-known Monk. I think the version of "Epistrophy" here isn't as good as the one on the trio's live album Sound of Love. You're also going to have to pick up Sound of Love for the trio's signature Monk tune, "Misterioso", which isn't included on Monk in Motian.Overall, this album is recommended for fans of this trio's music. People who dislike noisy electric guitar might instead check out the three volumes of On Broadway and the Bill Evans tribute. However, the group has better recordings than this one.

This is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the US over 40 years ago. In the hands of lesser musicians this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music, but not here. Stan Getz's feathery, soft saxophone playing weaves beautiful melodies over the swaying, dancing Brazilian rhythms. Charlie Byrd's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tunes will get stuck in your head after 3 spins or less. The only possible complaint is the short playing time -- a mere 35 minutes.This recording isn't as well-known as Getz/Gilberto but is just as essential. If you like Getz's playing, be sure to get some of his other, non-bossa-nova recordings as well. (One more caveat: those looking for more vocals by Astrud or Joao Gilberto will be disappointed -- this CD is entirely instrumental.)

I'd put season 4 a notch above 2 and 3, which were both generally excellent. It's not quite at the "firing on all cylinders" brilliance of the final 3 seasons, but there are only a few duds and even the filler episodes are fairly strong.Worf's arrival is of course the big surprise here - at times he feels a little grafted on and out of place, though by season 5 he would be an inseparable part of the cast. The first ten or so episodes are a very strong stretch - "The Way of the Warrior", "The Visitor", "Indiscretion", "Homefront"/"Paradise Lost", "Our Man Bashir", "Little Green Men". There are few low points - "The Sword of Kahless" and "Sons of Mogh" (reflecting Star Trek's continuing struggle with making good Klingon episodes) and "The Muse" - before the series regains its equilibrium and closes on a strong note. ("The Quickening" is a classic.)Better stuff lay ahead, but I think this is around the time that I began anticipating practically every episode.

This is one of my best discoveries from the past few years; all the effusive praise from the other reviewers is right on. It's perhaps a cliche to say a jazz album has a "late night vibe" or is a perfect complement for a date and a bottle of wine... but every cliche has a grain of truth, doesn't it?"The Touch of Your Lips" - an absolutely beautiful, gently but insistently swinging performance, pretty much sets the M.O. for the rest of the album. Yeah, there are two gorgeous ballads (especially "In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning" - one of the best ballads I've heard by any artists) and one brisk gallop in "Sunday" (love Thigpen's switch from brushes to sticks), but this album pretty much moves at the pace of a mellow, comfortable walk.Except for a few moments on "Sunday", "This Can't Be Love" and maybe some other tune I don't remember, we get the soft side of Ben - not much of that wonderful growling tone he would often adopt on faster tunes. The rhythm section is just so locked-in it's ridiculous; Oscar is sort of hit-and-miss with me in general, but he's superb here. And this album made me totally "get" Ray Brown; his playing here, perfectly captured by the engineer, is tremendous.This can't be love, this can't be love... oh yes it can!

I got into jazz via fusion, and picked this up as a "historically important recording". It went completely over my head at the time (as did B*tches Brew). Mahavishnu, Weather Report (especially from Mysterious Traveller onward), Holdsworth-era Lifetime, and the electrified Return to Forever were bands that played in a jazz-influenced style - there was improvisation - but within the context of clear-cut rock-style compositions. This album predates those and still has very strong, obvious ties to the modal-to-free post-bop that Williams had recently played with Miles Davis - relatively simple melodies and sparse arrangements quickly dispensed with so that the musicians could play extended, exploratory solos. It's closer in style to mid-60s Miles or Coltrane than to Birds of Fire or Romantic Warrior.Listen to the first tune, "Emergency". Yeah, the melody is played over a rock rhythm, but as soon as John McLaughlin begins his blistering solo, Tony switches to a swinging post-bop rhythm. These guys were familiar with the 60s jazz avant-garde and they definitely bend (but never break) rhythm and tonality.There are two other beefs with the album. Yes, Tony's vocals are bad, and the lyrics are even worse. You just have to shrug these off - even the 3 tracks they appear on contain some fiery instrumental playing.The sound is poor, but it's not catastrophic. You can hear McLaughlin and Williams fine; Larry Young is hurt the most, and I wish he'd been recorded better. (You can get a sense of what he sounded like during this period on the Blue Note release "Mother Ship" under his name.) I wouldn't go quite so far as saying I'm glad it's poorly recorded, but the rough recording does add to the intensity for sure.Overall, Emergency is a diamond in the rough. It's not the first attempt to merge jazz and rock, but it's among the earliest where the musicians actually understood both styles and combined them in a thoughtful way to create something new. I find it hard to believe that someone could listen to the explosive playing on "Sangria for Three" and not shout in amazement.

Keith Jarrett's American group is probably my favorite of the groups he's led, and I know I'm not alone. This is actually not a bad starter entry into the band's music - it covers most of the terrain that the group inhabited. You have relatively pop-oriented stuff featuring electric guitarist Sam Brown ("Treasure Island" and "Sister Fortune"). On the opposite side of the spectrum, you have free jazz ("Angles (Without Edges)" and "Fullsuvollivus". There's the feel-good "Blue Streak". And then you have the pure grooves - "Le Mistral" and my favorite, "The Rich (And the Poor)". If you're a Dewey Redman fan, you'll love his playing here - it's among the most soulful I haven't heard. (Also, props to Charlie Haden and Paul Motian, of all people, laying down such a slow, deep groove.) Beautiful. The two things you do miss out on are the lengthier, time-to-stretch tracks the band would feature on the albums Shades, Mysteries and Backhand, as well as the world-music-oriented improvisations they would do from time to time.Over the last three decades, Keith has mined a few seams very deeply. Here he was still young, and not really constrained by the idea of what music should or shouldn't sound like. It's quite similar to the Columbia album "Expectations", which has similar personnel and music. However, unless you're really cautious, I would throw caution to the wind and get the 5 CD (or MP3 equivalent) of the Impulse 1973-74 Keith Jarrett box. It contains plenty of other classic music - not just Treasure Island, but also Fort Yawuh (extended to 2 CDs), Death and the Flower, and Backhand.

First, the correct tracklist:1. The Happy Blues2. The Great Lie3. Can't We Be Friends?4. MadhouseReading the liner notes, it seems like this album was thrown together on the spot. A bunch of musicians showed up at the Prestige Records office that Friday for a recording session. The original pianist went MIA so they had to wake up Duke Jordan as a substitute. Finally they all trekked over to Rudy Van Gelder's studio in order to make the recording. All the wonderful cliches of a jam session are here: simple arrangements of blues and standards, cooking solos, riffing behind the soloist, trading fours and eights.Despite being under Gene Ammons's nominal leadership, it's fair to say that no single musician really dominates this session. It's nice to hear Gene's huge tenor sound in this context (he's often typecast as a groove or ballad player), and young Jackie Mac really smokes even if he hasn't completely matured as a player yet. Candido's congas provide that extra bit of rhythmic spice. Art Taylor's drumming is as crisp as usual.&quot;Can't We Be Friends&quot; and the title track are taking at a relaxed, moderate pace, allowing the musicians to settle into the groove. &quot;The Great Lie&quot; is absolutely electric here. &quot;Madhouse&quot; is appropriately titled (despite being a thinly veiled &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love&quot;) -- a fun, insane romp that builds from trading fours into a final, tri-horn collective improv. There's a sense of friendly competition; you can sense it during some of the trading-fours sequences, when some of the musicians (particularly Jackie) can't wait until it's their turn!I definitely recommend this to any hard bop fan. Sometimes blowing sessions fall flat, but that is certainly not a problem on the Happy Blues.

This is a very nice blow session, recorded almost 9 months after the extremely popular Somethin' Else. Unlike the earlier album, this one is definitely a Cannonball album in style. Unlike many later albums, this is a blowing session rather than a studio appearance by a live, working band.I'll admit to being lukewarm on Milt Jackson and my judgment of this album is probably affected downward as a result. Milt's playing is nice here, just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period, there is a healthy mix of ballads ("Serves Me Right"), bebop ("Groovin' High"), interesting originals ("Blues Oriental" by Milt Jackson) and extremely funky material ("Sounds for Sid"). Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one. Fans of Cannonball's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here.

Sahara is the first of Tyner's great Milestone albums. People who are familiar only with his 60s work with Coltrane and others may be surprised -- though rooted in modality, his playing here is dense, chromatic and HUGE. &quot;Rebirth&quot; approaches some 60s energy music in terms of intensity. Sonny Fortune's saxophone playing is quite heated on &quot;Rebirth&quot; and &quot;Ebony Queen&quot;, while Tyner's piano has the presence of an orchestra. But there is also time for reflective playing, as on the piano solo feature &quot;A Prayer for My Family&quot; and the dreamy &quot;Valley of Life&quot; (McCoy plays a koto here). The closing title suite really holds together and covers a lot of ground, just like its namesake. If you like this, get the live Enlightenment (also on Milestone); both are exceptional, innovative (!), and acoustic post-bop. (Sadly, Ken Burns hasn't heard them.)

I believe this is the final Cannonball Adderley recording with Yusef Lateef. During his almost 2 years with the group, Yusef had a major impact on the group's music, adding a sense of depth and gravitas that wasn't always there prior to his arrival.The first half of this CD is very nice, but the album really clicks on the last three tracks. "Come Sunday" is given a beautiful reading primarily focusing on Joe Zawinul's piano and Sam Jones's bass."Brother John", a Lateef composition, is a powerful tribute to the mighty John Coltrane, with Lateef's oboe playing consciously echoing Trane's soprano (which in turn was influenced by South Asian oboe-like reed instruments). There's some fine, adventurous playing by Cannonball, Nat and Joe on this great tune - the best performance on the CD.Finally, the album closes with "Work Song"; I haven't heard any live performances of this tune by the Cannonball group that were less than exciting.I think Cannonball in Europe is overall a better album, but if you like this group I recommend Nippon Soul wholeheartedly.

Animals was the first in a trilogy of Pink Floyd albums dominated by Roger Waters' lyrical and (eventually) musical ideas. I am in a minority on this matter, but I think this domination of the band had a negative impact on the band's music and creativity. While many Floyd fans - particularly those new to the band - will find Animals to be appealing, partly due to the fact that it has not suffered the radio overplay of Dark Side or The Wall - those who like the collaborative and more diverse nature of earlier Floyd albums may be disappointed.Unlike The Wall and The Final Cut, which moved Floyd to a more radio-friendly, short song format, Animals sticks to the lengthy epics of early albums. The instrumental sound of the music is quite similar to that on Wish You Were Here, and there are still quite a few lengthy instrumental passages. But those passages tend to be fairly straightforward, with little of the spacy and abstract "head music" of Floyd's earlier work. Gilmour's guitar playing dominates throughout; Rick Wright, aside from a very nice electric piano solo at the beginning, is limited to textural work. "Dogs" is probably the best of the bunch - especially the first half - followed by "Sheep". The two "Pigs on the Wing" bookends are actually quite lovely and tend to be overlooked. And I've always found "Pigs" to be completely boring, just mainstream 70s rock dragged to an unnecessary length - but again, I'm in a minority here.Waters's lyrics are the second key component here, and your assessment of the album will ultimately ride on how you feel about them. I personally find the Animals theme to be uninteresting rather than clever. It doesn't help that Waters's voice, occasionally effective but more often hectoring (it would get worse on later albums), ends up keeping the emotional range of the music very narrow.Overall, not a bad listen - but Pink Floyd's preceding albums are generally better.

I actually approached this with some trepidation - my experience with mid-to-late 60s big-band-and-stars jazz recordings has been mixed. A lot of times the big band serves to smooth the edges and grit off a soloist, making them accessible to pop audiences but also watering down what made them so exciting to jazz listeners.Fortunately this wasn't the case here, and in fact this is one of my favorite Turrentine recordings. Oliver Nelson's big band arrangements do nothing to dilute Stanley's soulful playing. While Nelson's writing doesn't have the forward-looking innovation of work done by Ellington, Ellis, Evans and Sun Ra around this time (to pick 4 great big-band composers mentioned by another reviewer), as far as big band writing they leave little to be desired. Even the softer moments avoid slipping into 60s mood-music. You also have a strong rhythm section of Herbie Hancock, Kenny Burrell and Grady Tate. "River's Invitation" is a particularly strong opener, but none of the other tracks disappoint. Also, the two bonus tracks are excellent and fit very well with the initial release.I haven't heard any other Stan-with-big-band albums, but I guess this one was a big enough success that his next few releases included mid-size ensembles arranged by Duke Pearson. If you like this one, I would also check out Cannonball Adderley's Nelson-arranged Domination, recorded around the same time.

Water Babies was one of the first albums to be released durings Miles's retirement in the late 70s. Columbia was digging through the archives and they packaged together two very different sessions. They used Corky McCoy's cartoons as cover art, but this music has very little in common with On the Corner.The first three tracks are from June 1967 and feature the 2nd Great Quintet (Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams). All 3 themes are by Shorter, and feature the same dry, exploratory style that this group perfected on its other LPs. If you like the albums Sorcerer and Nefertiti, you'll enjoy this stuff as well. (Wayne also recorded &quot;Capricorn&quot;, &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; and &quot;Water Babies&quot; on his own album, Super Nova.)The next three tracks (of which &quot;Splash&quot; is a bonus track not on the original LP) were recorded in November 1968. By this time Dave Holland had replaced Carter on bass. Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock both play electric piano, giving the music a similar feel to Filles de Kilimanjaro though it doesn't match that album's excellence. &quot;Two Faced&quot; is a haunting Shorter composition that runs for 18 minutes and features beautiful playing by Wayne and Miles. &quot;Dual Mr. Anthony...&quot; is a typical late 60s boogaloo -- funky, a little heavy on the cheese factor and not really distinctive except for Tony Williams's explosive drumming and Wayne Shorter's fierce blowing. &quot;Splash&quot; is also a boogaloo, though a little less cheesy.Water Babies doesn't really hang well as an album and I'd still recommend any of the Quintet's other 6 albums (E.S.P., Miles Smiles, Sorcerer, Nefertiti, Miles in the Sky, Filles de Kilimanjaro) over this one. The material is available elsewhere, on the '65-'68 and In a Silent Way box sets, if you prefer to hear it &quot;in context&quot;. But overall the music is good enough that Miles fanatics who don't have the box sets will want to pick Water Babies up.

This is a really nice album. I was somewhat wary of picking it up due to the fact that Pharoah plays exclusively soprano, but his playing on the smaller horn is just fantastic. The presence of Woody Shaw and Gary Bartz adds a nice texture to the music, though their roles as soloists are pretty minor. Pianist Lonnie Liston Smith has some really nice Tynerish playing. As other reviewers have mentioned, there's little of the yodeling that appears on other Pharoah albums from this period.The first tune works itself into a frantic modal groove with lots of colorful percussion. It reminds me a lot of McCoy Tyner's work from the early 70s, though there's more collective improvisation on this disc.The second track is a really magical, beautiful performance of "Let Us Go into the House of the Lord". Arranged much like Coltrane's "Psalm" and "Song of Praise", Pharoah's ecstatic playing frames great solos by Smith and bassist Cecil McBee.Personally, I like this album more than the better-known Karma. This is the kind of disc that will appeal to fans of McCoy Tyner's early 70s work, Sweetnighter-era Weather Report, or Keith Jarrett's Impulse albums. Recommended!

Dewey Redman spent the early 70s working with both Ornette Coleman and Keith Jarrett, so it's interesting to hear him leading a date. The music on this CD (expanded to over one hour from the original seven tracks) has the same lively, slightly unhinged feel that I associate with Ornette's music, no doubt abetted by the fact that Dewey plays alto sax on five of the tracks. I personally prefer his playing on tenor, where he has the thick Texas sound and doesn't sound at all like the other avant-garde tenor titans."Interconnection", "Walls-Bridges", and "Sunlanding" scampering, knotty free-bop tunes with some of the recording's more energetic playing. "Sunlanding" is the most challenging of the three and packs a lot of frantic playing into 2 1/2 minutes. "Imani" is a ballad, sort-of, with Dewey doing some of his trademark singing-into-the-saxophone; pretty sinister sounds on this one courtesy of the bowed bass, assorted percussion and Jane Robertson's cello. And "Boody" is a deep, deep blues with an occasional rock backbeat; it features the best tenor playing of the album. My personal highlight is "Image (In Disguise)", where Dewey plays the musette and takes an insane unaccompanied cadenza. Bassist Sirone and drummer Eddie Moore due a great job at keeping the exploratory music from flying apart. The bonus tracks (8-11) include "QOW", a funky groove number, and the pretty ballad "Joie de Vivre". If you like this, be sure to pick up Keith Jarrett's Fort Yawuh, where Dewey is absolutely mindblowing (and plays some more musette). Anyway, Ear of the Behearer is a great slab of 70s avant-garde from a somewhat underrated saxophone giant.

This is the second of two Live at the Village Vanguard albums from the Paul Motian trio. Recorded in June 1995, it is a good sampling of what you'll hear if you go to their annual gig at that same club: some Monk, a standard, and a few Motian originals. The pot is sweetened by the Mingus ballad that gives this album its name.The set opens with a brilliant, extended interpretation of Monk's "Misterioso". Frisell's countryfied solo (he plays nearly devoid of electronic effects on this disc) is a highlight. "Duke Ellington's Sound of Love" and "Good Morning Heartache" are fine ballad performances; the first is profound, the second is touching. As far as the Motian originals, "Mumbo Jumbo" is one of the drummer's best compositions and gets an intense reading here. Lovano's duet with Motian on the second half of the tune showcases both at their finest. "Once Around the Park" opens with a solo introduction by Frisell and slides into a very nice, swinging performance.I highly recommend this disc. Its twin, Live at the Village Vanguard, is also excellent if not quite at Sound of Love's level. Nevertheless if you like one, get the other.

I haven't heard all of Turrentine's Blue Note albums, but this one is probably my favorite. It's from the beginning of his run on the label, and despite falling comfortably in the soul jazz category will probably appeal to fans of more straight-ahead hard bop as well.The magic ingredient here is Les McCann. His playing here combines extreme soulfulness and funk with melodic inventiveness. He also contributes most of the compositions - we blast out of the gate with the gospelly, dancing "Smile, Stacey", but also get the beautiful ballad "Doreen Don't Cry, I". Stanley's playing is superb throughout, and the rhythm section is tight!Highly recommended!

John Coltrane recorded so frequently for the Prestige label during '56-'58 that it's tough to figure out where to start. This May 1957 recording, coming just after his departure from the Miles Davis Quintet, is a pretty good initiation; it doesn't reach the heights of Blue Train (the indisputable classic from Trane's early period, recorded for Blue Note) but is still a great session of hard bop with plenty of Coltrane's powerful, intense playing. The album's peaks are two ballads (&quot;Violets for Your Furs&quot;, &quot;While My Lady Sleeps&quot; -- Coltrane was already an incredible ballad player by this time) and the tense &quot;Bakai&quot;. The other tracks are all prime hard bop. My only real complaint is about the rest of the players: the rhythm section (Mal Waldron and Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, Al Heath on drums) is excellent, but Johnny Splawn (trumpet) and Sahib Shihab (baritone sax) pale in comparison to some of the other horn players Coltrane recorded with around this time. Nevertheless, First Trane is a great purchase for any Coltrane fan; the 20 bit remaster by Fantasy has crystal clear sound. One final note: this album is actually titled &quot;Coltrane&quot; on the CD. There's another (excellent) album of the same name which John Coltrane recorded in 1962 for the Impulse! label in a very different style. Be aware which one you are buying.

This is, as far as I know, the final recorded meeting of Cannonball Adderley and Bill Evans, the warmest and the coolest of the Kind of Blue alumni. To throw another quirk into the mix, they're backed by the light and precise tandem of Percy Heath and Connie Kay, making a guest appearance away from the MJQ.This is a nice album, but falls short of classic status in my view. For one, while some of Cannonball's quintet albums around this time period were probably a little too light on the ballads, this one goes too far the other way. The best material is the up-tempo stuff - "Waltz for Debby", "Who Cares", "Toy" - which is just fantastic, and in general none of the rest fit into my "favorite Cannonball ballad performances" list. Also, I am not crazy about the overly-restrained rhythm section - it would have been great to have Philly Joe Jones or Paul Motian in the drum seat instead.OK, enough complaining. If you want a mellow ballad-oriented album, more restrained than what Cannonball usually recorded, this will be right up your alley. But there are better ballad-oriented albums - and better Cannonball albums - out there.

1959 was a milestone year for Charles Mingus -- he recorded four albums which included some of his best known, and best, compositions/performances. Unlike the other three albums, which mostly feature larger ensembles, this semi-obscure one has a stripped down quintet: John Handy on alto, Booker Ervin on tenor, Richard Wyands on piano (subbing for Horace Parlan), and Danny Richmond.Two of the compositions here, "Nostalgia in Times Square" and "Alice's Wonderland", also appear on the album Mingus Dynasty under the titles "Strollin'" and "Diane". The former is a swinger with an extremely catchy melody; the second is one of Mingus's finest ballads. "No Private Income Blues" is a spectacular performance. Handy and Ervin trade scorching licks at ever-shrinking intervals, eventually engaging in a thrilling simultaneous improvisation. I think it anticipates some of the better-known performances with Eric Dolphy. The only standard, "I Can't Get Started", is a feature for Handy.Overall, this album is highly recommended. Both saxophonists play at a very high level, and Mingus's bass is more heavily featured than on other albums from this year. I wouldn't quite put it on the level of Mingus Ah Um, Mingus Dynasty or Blues & Roots, but you will almost certainly like it if you enjoy those. It will probably also appeal to fans of Mingus at Antibes or The Great Concert.

I have heard only a fraction of Stan's Blue Note albums, so I don't know whether this album is unique, but it's definitely the most straight-ahead I've heard. Yeah, there's some funky and bluesy playing here, but entirely within a hard-bop context - no organ, no congas, no crossover-friendly material. (Not that there's anything wrong with those things.)Instead we get chorus after chorus of gritty playing by Stan, Grant Green, and Horace Parlan, underpinned by the solid yet swinging combo or George Tucker and Al Harewood. We get some bebop-friendly standards like "But Not for Me" and "Broadway", beautiful ballad performances like "Summertime" and "Yesterdays", and of course lengthy blues jams. "Later at Minton's" is, as the other reviewer states, the highlight of the set.One of the best Blue Note Stans I've heard. Check it out!

Discussion of this album tends to be dominated by the title track, which was a hit single. It's a nice, catchy tune (probably closer to instrumental R&B; than jazz for the genre-obsessed) but highly unrepresentative of the rest of the album, which is an excellent snapshot of mainstream mid-60s jazz.Some critics accuse Cannonball of "selling out" and "commercializing" his music, and yeah, you can hear the influence of popular music here. But there's absolutely no compromise in the integrity of the music, and Cannonball's playing is actually more edgy and adventurous than on his earlier bebop recordings. Listen to "Games", a fairly innocuous soul jazz tune, where Cannonball plays some fairly avant-garde stuff.The best material on here is on "Sticks" (one of Cannonball's best tunes) and "Sack'o'Woe". The latter is an interesting contrast to the classic 1960 version with Victor Feldman; this one has less of the driving swing rhythm but is much, much funkier. "Fun" is relatively adventurous post-bop and "Hippodelphia" is one of Zawinul's best straight-ahead tunes.If you like this one, I would also check out "Money in the Pocket" and "Why Am I Treated So Bad".

This is one of the weakest albums in the RVG series. The lineup is good on paper -- the organ trio of Green, Big John Patton and Ben Dixon (which made many excellent recordings in the early 60s) joined by Johnny Coles and mighty Joe Henderson on the front line. But in this case, good on paper translates into unremarkable in reality.The slow and medium tempos here add up to a sleepy mood, with Green (and occasionally one of the other players) soloing over arrangements by Duke Pearson. There's not much interaction between the soloists and the rhythm section. Things only loosen up on the last track, a 14 minute jam that lifts the album out of its doldrums.Am I Blue came right before the prime of Grant Green's career -- a one year span when he recorded Idle Moments, Matador, Solid, Talkin' About and Street of Dreams under his own name and played as a sideman on Larry Young's Into Somethin' and Lee Morgan's (stupendous) Search for the New Land. But I'd recommend listening to any of those other great albums before you buy this dud.

Much as The Final Cut was largely a Roger Waters solo album with other members contributing as session members, the same can be said for Momentary Lapse and David Gilmour. Momentary Lapse does sound more like a 70s Floyd album than The Final Cut did, but this is at least partly because Gilmour and Bob Ezrin tried really hard to make it sound that way. Waters referred to it as a "pretty fair forgery" and that is not a bad description.That said, Waters's description includes "fair" as well as "forgery". This is an enjoyable album and, aside from the abysmal "The Dogs of War", doesn't include any real duds. Historical revisionism has tended to exaggerate Waters's importance in the band's music; through 1975, he was just one of four key contributors. The two instrumentals are very good, and "Sorrow" comes pretty close to classic status. Some might be disappointed that the album isn't all doom and gloom ("On the Turning Away", "One Slip"), but before 1973 Pink Floyd covered a much wider range of emotional ground.I wouldn't recommend getting this until you have most of Floyd's other work. It's a poor substitute for Dark Side or Wish You Were Here. The Division Bell, made by the same crew 7 years later, is a superior effort. But if you have those albums and really want something that sounds like 70s Pink Floyd under the Pink Floyd name, this album probably won't disappoint.

This followup to the excellent Night Dreamer is one of Wayne Shorter's best albums on Blue Note record. It places him in a challenging context: he's the only horn in front of two members and one alumnus of John Coltrane's rhythm section. Any lesser musician would have been smothered by juggernauts like Elvin Jones and McCoy Tyner, but Shorter rises to the challenge. And rather than marking him as a Trane disciple, the backing really highlights differences between the two.The opening track, "Ju Ju", places him in the surging modal groove that this rhythm section had mastered on "My Favorite Things" and "Out of This World"; but Wayne's playing is a bit more quirky and asymmetrical, less dense than that of Elvin and McCoy's boss. "Deluge" and "Mahjong" highlight Shorter's growing ability to convey images or ideas through composition. And his tunes are always completely surprising, taking 90 degree turns where you least expecting them -- the ballad "House of Jade" (beautiful intro by Tyner) is a classic example. "Yes or No" ventures into Coltrane territory in classic Shorter curveball fashion, while "12 More Bars to Go" is a blues with several connotations.Along with Speak No Evil this is the perfect introduction to Wayne Shorter's solo albums. Great saxophone playing, great sidemen, and great compositions. Who could complain?

This is a great album for lots of reasons. It features three of the most distinct stylists on tenor saxophone, as well as an up-and-coming star on trumpet; the tunes (two standards and two Griffin tunes) bring out the best in the first-rate musicians; and the jam-session nature of the recording gives it a relaxed, spontaneous feeling. Johnny Griffin, the least known of the saxophonists, is unbelievable -- you won't believe your ears as he rockets through several choruses of the warp-speed &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; but nevers loses sight of the blues. Hank Mobley's mellow, lyrical playing provides a great foil to his more aggressive counterparts. John Coltrane, then in his layoff from the Miles Davis group and beginning his tenure with Thelonious Monk, shows his rapidly evolving, harmonically challenging style. Lee Morgan is really inspired on this recording, and the rhythm section is incredible: Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Art Blakey. Blakey is on fire here, by the way; just listen to him trading choruses with Griffin! This is essential listening for anyone who likes 50s hard bop.

As one would expect, season 1 of Deep Space Nine is the weakest of the show's run. Many of the characteristics that would make the show so great - extensive character development, plot arcs, a large set of secondary characters, and rich inter-character relationships - are already here in embryonic forms. That said, it's also pretty clear that the writers haven't figured out what the show is about, aside from "Star Fleet on a Space Station."That means that we get plenty of 2nd-tier (and a few 3rd-tier) filler episodes. It's certainly better than TNG's first season, which at times was quite painful to watch. (To be fair, DS9 had the benefit of experience.) Per my reference to "Star Fleet on a Space Station", we get plenty of throwaway episodes that could have easily occurred aboard the Enterprise. There's also a reflex toward special appearances by minor TNG characters, generally with mediocre results.That said, a few episodes make this season worth watching - especially the last two, which are worthy of mention along highlights from season to come. "Duet" is a classic, and "In the Words of the Prophets" is the kind of thoughtful, exciting arc episode that would eventually characterize the show.A casual fan could probably skip at least half of the 20 episodes on this set, but make sure you watch the rest.

Amigos came on the heels of some of Santana's most adventurous work. But by 1976, the musical climate was no longer conducive to the exploratory jazz-rock of Welcome and Borboletta; the twin pressures of disco and arena rock loomed over Santana, and the band moved toward airplay and a more commercial sound.Tom Coster, Carlos and producer David Rubinson probably looked at the eclecticism, catchy melodies and punchy rhythms of Abraxas when creating Amigos [...]. "Take Me With You" is a slicked-up "Incident at Neshabur" and the much-praised "Europa" is a more professional (but less moving) guitar ballad in the mold of "Samba Pa Ti". These guys knew how to mimic a good formula! Other highlights are the Latin folk of "Gitano", the catchy "Dance Sister Dance" (nice jam at the end), and the funky "Tell Me Are You Tired". "Let It Shine", the band's blatant attempt to cash in on the disco craze, is conveniently placed at the end of the album. Overall, this is a very good album that doesn't take many chances but will please most Santana fans.

This album comes from a period in Santana's career where declining sales led him and the band to take their music in a more commercial, accessible direction. That's not to say that the band "sold out"; there are still long instrumental sections and flashy solos by Carlos and keyboardist Tom Coster. But the rawness of the early albums and the adventurousness of the early 70s period are gone, replaced by a more "professional" (for better or worse) approach.About 40% of the album was actually recorded in the studio. In general this is above average for Santana of this period, and compares favorably to material on Amigos and Festival. "She's Not There", a cover of the classic Zombies tune, is nicely done. I also like the instrumentals, especially "Flor D'Luna".The other 60% is live. It's not bad but not great. I'm not a big fan of Graham Lear's drumming on "Black Magic Woman" -- way too rockish and "square", unlike Michael Shrieve's slinky Latin groove on earlier versions. And this version of "Soul Sacrifice" is a pale shadow of either the studio version or the legendary Woodstock performance. The percussion section is definitely nowhere near what it was in the band's early days.If you like Santana's mid-late 70s sound or live rock albums from that period, you will definitely want to pick Moonflower up (and will surely rate it higher than I did). If you prefer Santana's first three albums or the early 70s jazz-rock period, you may be disappointed. (Though I doubt you will feel you wasted your money.) If you're interested in picking up your first Santana live album, I would go for either the complete Woodstock performance (on the 2 cd reissue of the first Santana album), the 1971 Fillmore gig (on the 2 cd reissue of Santana III), or the 1973 live album Lotus. After you get those, check this one out.

In the liner notes to another ECM album, a musician (Edward Vesala, I think) suggests that playing "free ballads" is one of the hardest things to do in jazz. I guess it has to do with reconciling the tension between free or avant-garde playing and the sensitivity necessary to pull off a great ballad performance. I only mention this because I think the three musicians on this CD do a great job of reconciling these two tensions, offering what's essentially a "ballads" album containing adventurous and challenging improvisation.The album starts out slowly, with "Osmosis Part III" sounding like we're joining things about halfway through. It sounds like 3 am and the musicians are quietly lamenting some great loss. The next few tunes, with the exception of "Odd Man Out", all proceed at a very relaxed, dreamy pace. There's a beautiful interpretation of the title tune and another, shorter version (excerpt?) of "Osmosis" to close off the first half. The second half of the album is more up-tempo, and the individual songs better defined. "Dance" is a classic Motian tune, hummable yet convoluted, with some feisty interplay between the trio. "Harmony" starts out as a Motian-Lovano duet, one of the few tunes here that contains a really linear pulse. Lovano's playing on this tune is all about quiet, controlled intensity. "The Riot Act" is the tune where Frisell dips into his effects most heavily (though he does it in a more subtle fashion on other parts of the album). "One in Three" is an unusual mix of alternating ballad and intense non-ballad sections. The album closes in a melodic fashion with "Dreamland".As other people have commented, Bill Frisell is at his "jazziest" here -- a few effects here and there, plenty of his characteristic twang. Lovano plays warmly, beautifully, and brilliantly; the comparisons another reviewer made to Lester Young and Stan Getz are appropriate, not because Lovano sounds like them, but because there's the same appreciation that "sound" matters as much as "notes". "Dewey Redman meets Lester Young" isn't too off the mark. And Mr. Motian sounds like he's having a great time. He's not especially interested in "drumming" here, but there aren't many drummers who understand melody as well as he does. You can get a lot out of this album just by listening to him.If this sounds like your kind of thing, then I really recommend picking up this album. Just three veteran musicians enjoying themselves making subtle, beautiful music. When the CD stops, the mood lingers.(I think the comparison made to Charles Lloyd's Voice in the Night album is interesting, and if you like the "mood" of the ballads on that album then you'll like what you find here. That said, that album was a lot more straight-ahead, up-tempo and explicitly blues-rooted. This one is more introverted and a lot more "free", as the jazz parlance goes.)

As far as jazz guitar on Blue Note records goes, there are two names you must know: Grant Green and Kenny Burrell. And while Grant's discography for Blue Note is humungous, Kenny did much of his recording as a sideman. But the numbers are all irrelevant when you listen to this masterpiece -- seven tunes that reach deep, deep into the blues and achieve that wonderfully lazy, after hours groove.The performances are all classic, from the Latin groove of &quot;Chitlins con Carne&quot;, to the brisk swing of the title track, to the solo guitar of &quot;Soul Lament&quot;. Stanley Turrentine's soulful saxophone playing is among his finest, and the bass/drums/conga rhythm section is impeccable at setting up a groove. And the leader provides tasty guitar playing that mixes bebop lines and bluesy feeling perfectly. As far as hearing some classic jazz guitar, Midnight Blue and Grant Green's Idle Moments album are a perfect start.

Blue Note is slowly bringing Jackie McLean's mid-60s catalogue to print -- an exciting run of recordings that bridged the gap between hard bop and the innovative concepts of Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. All of these albums (or at least the ones I've heard) feature McLean surrounded by exciting sidemen and contributing his trademark take-no-prisoners playing.Like the better-known classic Let Freedom Ring, Right Now features McLean fronting a quartet. For those of us who love McLean's playing, this is a big bonus because he doesn't compete for solo space with any other horns. Jackie rises to the occasion, contributing plenty of intense and unfettered blowing. The other guy who really stands out is the underrated Clifford Jarvis; his turbocharged drumming powers the faster tunes.Aside from &quot;Poor Eric&quot; (pianist Larry Willis's moving tribute to the late, great Dolphy, with maybe a sideways glance toward Mingus's Town Hall Concert album), the compositions are basically bread-and-butter Blue Note 60s post-bop: two fast swingers (&quot;Eco&quot;, &quot;Christel's Time&quot;) and a grooving boogaloo (&quot;Right Now&quot;). But don't worry -- it's the high-energy playing that completely justifies picking up this excellent record.

I've heard it said that this live album makes the 80s King Crimson studio albums superfluous. Well, don't throw away your copies of Discipline, Beat and Three of a Perfect Pair quite yet -- there are several great tunes that the band didn't perform at this concert. Nevertheless, this is one of the best King Crimson archival releases thus far; the band really burns through the bulk of their 80s tunes, as well as two 70s warhorses (&quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Larks' Tongues pt. 2&quot;). &quot;Entry of the Crims&quot; is pretty intense, with a dissonant guitar duet. &quot;Industry&quot;, &quot;Waiting Man&quot;, &quot;Dig Me&quot;, and &quot;Larks Tongues pt. 3&quot; are all given outstanding performances that completely outstrip the originals. &quot;Discipline&quot; is performed without a hitch, while &quot;Indiscipline&quot; opens with an entertaining drum duet (Belew &amp; Bruford). It's unfortunate that &quot;Neal &amp; Jack &amp; Me&quot;, &quot;Neurotica&quot; and &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; aren't here in place of inconsequential filler like &quot;Man with Open Heart&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, but those are minor details. If you like the 1980s King Crimson, you need this; and if you don't, Absent Lovers might change your mind.

Gone are the side-long suites, the sci-fi babble, and the high pitched screeching. This album, with its shorter songs, more mature lyrics and melodic hooks, set the template for Rush's output during the 80s. The influence of the Police and other new-wave bands begins to appear in a few of the songs. &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot;, are among the band's best songs; they deftly merge concise songwriting with proficient musicianship. Other highlights include the synth-drenched &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; and the underrated semi-epic &quot;Natural Science&quot;. This blows most other AOR albums out of the water.

Out of the first 3 quintet albums, this is probably my favorite. Them Dirty Blues was a very nice album, but Cannonball probably realized that this band was at its best and most intense on stage. That reflects itself pretty clearly in the amazing album opener, "Sack o' Woe".As far as I know, there are only two versions of Cannonball playing this tune. It's tough to pick a favorite between the one on this record and the one that would appear six years later on Mercy, Mercy, Mercy - probably the main difference is that this one has a bringing swinging rhythm at times. But it nevertheless grooves like crazy, and easily falls into the "greatest Cannonball tracks" category. Hats off to Victor Feldman, Sam Jones and Louis Hayes, who really make this work.The other tunes can be overshadowed by this monster, but they are very good nonetheless. Frank Rosolino's "Blue Daniel" is a nice mellow waltz. Most of the other tunes are fast, straight-ahead bebop. Those looking for a ballad will have to look at one of the later Cannonball live albums.While in general I prefer Cannonball's music after Yusef Lateef joined the band, this is the best I've heard from the period before then. Highly recommended.

Out of the seven acoustic albums that Wayne recorded for Blue Note, three are in the quartet format. Ju Ju and Adam's Apple are acknowledged classics, but Et Cetera is just as good if not as accessible. As far as rhythm section performances go, this is just about the best on any Shorter album (with the possible exception of Ju Ju); though the free and unpredictable interplay may be forbidding to some listeners, it generates a lot of heat and excitement. Herbie Hancock and Cecil McBee in particular deserves kudos.None of the Shorter tunes here are well-known, making each of the performances fresh. Wayne always had a taste for underused compositions by other artists: "Barracudas" is a Gil Evans piece treated in superb fashion by the quartet. And "Indian Song" is just incredible -- one of Wayne's most haunting, evocative tunes, even in comparison to "Footprints" or "Nefertiti". Wayne's playing is sparse and mysterious over the roiling, churning 5/4 rhythms.Though Speak no Evil and Ju Ju are probably better entry points for budding Wayne Shorter fans, this is definitely one of the highlights of his discography. Despite being released under Blue Note's limited edition Connoisseur series in the mid-90s, it hasn't gone out of print yet. Get this beautiful, mysterious music while it is available.

This exceptional album was one of McCoy Tyner's last albums for Blue Note, and it looks forward to the great run he would have on Milestone records for the rest of the 70s. Though it doesn't yet feature the dense, chromatic piano playing of Sahara and Enlightenment, a lot of the other elements are there -- extended modal blowing, elements of African and Asian music, and the appearance of background percussion.The lineup is the modal all-star team: not only former Tyner bandmate Elvin Jones, but also the great Wayne Shorter (who is quite &quot;convincing&quot; and &quot;original&quot;, and contributes one of the best soprano solos ever on &quot;Message from the Nile&quot;) and Gary Bartz on saxophones, and a surprise appearance by Alice Coltrane on the harp. Though she isn't a virtuoso soloist, the harp really adds to the exotic feel of the music. Ron Carter provides a flexible bedrock for the music.&quot;Message from the Nile&quot; (amazing, amazing, amazing) and &quot;The Wanderer&quot; are in the modal bag; &quot;His Blessings&quot; is a floating tone poem that could have indeed appeared on an Alice Coltrane album. Despite being further removed from the John Coltrane Quartet sound than The Real McCoy (1967), Extensions is a great companion to the masterpieces Tyner recorded for Milestone; if you like it, be sure to pick up Sahara (1972).

I agree with one of the other reviewers that "objectively" this album doesn't belong in the same tier as the best of Blue Note's avant-garde recordings (Out to Lunch, Point of Departure, etc) or an album like Miles Smiles.But at the same time, there's something in this album's seamless mixture of beautiful, lyrical playing and avant-garde freedom that I find to be really appealing. Tony's debut Life Time was a great album, both intellectually stimulating and exciting, but on this one his five compositions are more about playing and less about testing boundaries.This album is probably best remembered for being the only recorded encounter of Wayne Shorter and the man who preceded him in the Miles Davis Quintet, Sam Rivers. They actually don't play much together - "Extras" is the only track on which they both solo (with some collective improvisation at the end), and they collectively improvise on "From Before". It's fascinating to hear the contrast between the two and I wish we could have a reunion in 2008. "Love Song" is an achingly beautiful waltz featuring Sam Rivers, and "Tee" is primarily a vehicle for Wayne Shorter.If I had to pick the real star of this recording, though, it would be Herbie Hancock. He sits out the first two tracks, but his playing on "From Before" is among the best I've heard from him in the avant-garde style -- it's really something -- and he plays beautifully on "Love Song".In some ways I feel Tony's first two albums anticipated some of the early recordings on the ECM label. It's amazing that a 19-year-old drummer would come up with music like this. Check it out.

Conventional wisdom holds that this is a Miles Davis album, and that is pretty much right - it's an album led by Miles Davis, under Cannonball Adderley's name, set up to showcase the altoist who had just joined Davis's band. You can hear plenty of fine playing by Cannonball, but it's in Davis's world - the earthiness of many later Cannonball recordings isn't present.The similarities are particularly obvious on the classic interpretation of "Autumn Leaves" and the Davis original "Somethin' Else". "Love for Sale" was recorded under Davis's leadership 3 months later, with Cannonball present, and it's interesting to compare the two approaches. (I prefer the Davis version, but they are both superb.)Some people go further and compare this album to Kind of Blue. Yes, there are some similarities, particularly in the mood, but the "cerebralness" of the later album is largely absent on Somethin' Else. Hank Jones and Art Blakey have a very different, more conservative feel than Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb. And the funky "One for Daddy-O", a Nat original and the one tune that really screams "Cannonball Adderley album!", wouldn't really fit in on a Davis album, much less Kind of Blue.Overall a great album, and essential for most jazz fans.

This 1954 live recording is a momentous one in jazz history -- it's one of the first recordings in a style that would be known as hard bop. Blakey's quintet, a clear forerunner of his Jazz Messengers, approaches the classic bop style, mixes in some soul and gospel, and cranks up the energy. Art Blakey's turbocharged drumming, Horace Silver's funky, blues-drenched playing, and the formidable frontline of trumpet wizard Clifford Brown and Bird disciple Lou Donaldson set the mold for the style.Highlights of Volume 1 are the Horace Silver original &quot;Split Kick&quot; (nice Latin rhythms by Blakey on the theme) and a fiery &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;. (Blakey explains that he was present while the latter was composed by Dizzy Gillespie &quot;on the bottom of a garbage can&quot;.) I personally prefer Volume 2, but they are both excellent. Be sure to pick up both.

Among Grant Green's umpteen recordings for Blue Note, this is probably the best. (Though it gets some stiff competition from Matador and a few others.) His beautiful, relaxed improvisation on the gorgeous title track is a perfect instance of &quot;every note in its right place&quot; (Miles would have been proud). Vibes player Bobby Hutcherson and tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson were still relatively unknown when this CD was recorded but they play like old pros, while bassist Bob Cranshaw and drummer Al Harewood provide a sturdy, swinging support to the music.Idle Moments is one of the finest jazz guitar albums ever recorded and an essential part of any collection. Kenny Burrell's Midnight Blue is also up there. If you want to hear more of Grant Green's playing, pick up Matador (with McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones) and Larry Young's Into Somethin' (with Sam Rivers, Larry Young, and Elvin Jones).

This is one of my favorite Stanley Turrentine recordings, though I'll admit upfront I don't have anywhere near a complete collection. Like Joyride and Rough and Tumble, this one features Stan in front of a larger ensemble, playing groove-oriented soul jazz (rather than hard bop) centered around material drawn from popular music. In fact, the ensemble is almost identical to that on Rough and Tumble, with the main difference being Julian Priester's trombone replacing Grant Green's guitar.Of the three albums, this one is definitely my favorite. The album blasts out of the gate with the dancing groove of Duke Pearson's "The Magilla". Then after a lovely read of "When the Sun Comes Out", we get an intense read of Armando Boza's "La Fiesta" which is an absolute cracking composition, arrangement and performance. Duke Pearson, the arranger, was going for a totally different (and more interesting, to my mind) feel here than on Rough and Tumble. The second half of the album takes a mellower tack - the bossa interpretation of "Sunny", the lush ballad "Maybe September", and then the most straight-ahead selection - a swinging "You're Gonna Hear from Me".The Spoiler is the kind of album that shows commercially-accessible jazz doesn't have to compromise its integrity. Excellent stuff.

Tender Moments is my least favorite of the music McCoy Tyner recorded for Blue Note - overall, a very strong body of work. It's probably the tamest of his recordings for the label - if you like the polyrhythmic modal grooves and intense saxophone expressions on later albums like Expansions, Enlightenment, or the early Milestones, you'll probably be disappointed. The orchestrations, which echo Gil Evans and Duke Pearson, are generally interesting and thoughtful - someone who is less wedded to the idea of "what a McCoy album should sound like" might like it more than I did. If anything, those that find the early 70s albums to be unrelenting in their intensity might actually find the "tenderness" of this album to be appealing. The lineup is a very strong one though I wouldn't say any of the participants gives a particularly standout performance (I would have subbed Woody Shaw for Lee Morgan, and cut loose Bennie Maupin a little more).I'd recommend getting Tyner's other Blue Note recordings first, but this album is a worthwhile listen.

The liner notes to this box draw an analogy between Herbie Nichols, Thelonious Monk, and Andrew Hill -- three brilliant, individualistic pianist/composers who were heavily recorded by Blue Note founder Alfred Lion despite a lack of "commercial potential". Like Hill and Monk's tunes, each of Herbie's compositions has a very distinct personality, and they encompass a wide range of emotions and moods. They explore harmonies, rhythms and forms that were unorthodox in 1955 and still sound a little strange today. They range from "The Gig" (a humorous tongue-twister!) to the sinister, pounding chords of "Cro-Magnon Nights" and the upbeat Latin groove of "Brass Rings".If you like piano trio music and/or Monk and are willing to try something off the beaten track, this box set is HIGHLY recommended.

These 1947 recordings are among the earliest documents we have of piano genius and jazz pioneer Thelonious Sphere Monk. It's hard to believe that he was finally hailed with acclaim in 1957 for ideas he'd had 10 years earlier! When listening to these tracks, you should keep a couple of things in mind. First, recording technology wasn't too hot in 1947, and you can't expect the pristine, Rudy Van Gelder sound quality of 50s jazz. (Though compared to the 89 reissue, this Van Gelder edition sounds phenomenal.) Second, some of Monk's sidemen on this album didn't understand the new bop style very well, and were even more clueless on Monk's advanced ideas. (Even Art Blakey, one of Monk's best accompanists in the 50s, sounds a little confused here.) But these complaints aside, there's really phenomenal music here; tracks 7-16 (a trio with Blakey and bassist Gene Ramey) are especially marvelous, with classic recordings of Monk staples "Off Minor", "Ruby My Dear", "Well You Needn't" and "Introspection" as well as typically quirky takes on two standards ("April in Paris" and "Nice Work If You Can Get It"). The rest of the tracks are not quite up to the same standard due to the sidemen (Sahib Shihab provides the oddest alto saxophone sound ever on "Monk's Mood") but are still exciting. This set of 21 songs isn't quite as strong as Genius of Modern Music Volume 2, yet definitely essential for the Monk enthusiast.

In the 60s Blue Note diversified from being primarily a hard bop label to issuing adventurous recordings by Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, Eric Dolphy, Grachan Moncur and others. This album -- Andrew Hill's fourth for the label -- is one of the peaks of that diversification, and one of my favorite jazz albums from the 60s.Once I read a review where the author called this recording an avant-garde "Blues and the Abstract Truth", and the comparison is apt. Like that other album, Point of Departure unleashes an ensemble of brilliant improvisers on interesting, distinctive compositional material. Each tune inhabits its own musical universe, generating the album's significant sonic variety. As far as the ensemble, Eric Dolphy and Tony Williams pull the album in the avant-garde direction, Kenny Dorham provides some conservative ballast, and Joe Henderson sits somewhere in the middle. Richard Davis was Hill's bassist of choice, appearing on most of his early Blue Note albums. Hill himself offers some superb piano playing."Refuge" is the album's longest track. The solos are a pretty remarkable bunch -- it's tough to pick a favorite between those of Hill, Dolphy, Davis and Henderson. Each one offers a different interpretation of the tune. "New Monastery", as you might have guessed, is a tribute to Monk and has that typically Monkish lope. "Spectrum" is a suite that heavily features Dolphy on all three of his instruments: it opens with a section similar to "New Monastery", moves onto a Latin section in 5/4, and includes a ballad section with duetting flutes and a nice Dorham solo. "Flight 19", the shortest tune, plays solos by Hill and Davis off against collective improvisation by the ensemble. Finally, "Dedication" is the closing ballad; the mournful theme leads to inspired meditations by Dolphy, Hill (possibly his best of the session) and Henderson.If you like this, be sure to explore other Blue Note albums like Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch, Bobby Hutcherson's Dialogue and others. In addition, check out other Andrew Hill albums like Black Fire, Judgment and Passing Ships. I haven't been disappointed with any of his Blue Note releases, but in my opinion this one is the best.

Most if not all of Stanley's albums as a leader for Blue Note up until this point were with piano rather than organ - despite the fact that two of his greatest performances of the period were on Jimmy Smith's Back at the Chicken Shack and Midnight Special. But by the mid-60s he made the switch, bringing in his wife Shirley Scott for a series of albums.Scott has a totally different feel than Jimmy Smith - whereas Jimmy gets an intense, overpowering (in a good way) sound out of the organ, she plays it much mellower. (She also uses a bassist, unlike many other organists of the period.) While still comfortably "jazz", the material also tends to be more crossover-friendly, with more use of pop hits. Highlights include "Sara's Dance" (on the more straight-ahead side) and "Trouble" (on the pop side). The ballads are nice, but the version of "Without a Song" pales severely in comparison to Sonny Rollins's.This is a nice album, but not necessarily one I need to revisit often. I'll admit upfront I'm ambivalent about Scott's organ playing. Hustlin', with a similar lineup, adds some needed grit in the form of Kenny Burrell.

Joe Henderson was practically Blue Note's house saxophonist during 1963-66, at least along the bop-to-free side of things. If you like BN albums from this period, he's hard to avoid, so it's a good thing he was an excellent player right from the get-go.Page One was the first album under his name, and surprisingly only the third official recording he had made (after Kenny Dorham's Una Mas and Grant Green's Am I Blue). Kenny was a frequent collaborator of Joe's - they'd appear together on 6 albums during this period - and contributes two tunes, "La Mesha" and the very well known "Blue Bossa". The rhythm section was a strong one: McCoy Tyner on piano (playing much more straightforwardly than he did for Coltrane around this time), Butch Warren on bass, and Pete LaRoca on drums.Though this album is regarded pretty widely as a classic, it's not my favorite of Joe's five for Blue Note. This was his first, and you can sense that while he wanted to make a distinctive impression on listeners (he certainly succeeds!), he also held back from playing anything too scary. If you like the unrestrained Joe of Inner Urge or In Japan, you only get glimpses of that here. But if your tastes run more toward hard bop than free jazz, this may very well be your favorite Joe.

The irony about Out to Lunch is that despite the controversy it generates, it is still one of the most popular, accessible, and downright TUNEFUL albums to come out of jazz's 60s avant-garde. (And it has absolutely classic cover art.) If the avant-garde really isn't your thing, it may horrify you; but if you have any sympathy for this kind of stuff, even if you don't know it yet, you'll probably love it. I second others' suggestion to listen to Monk (Brilliant Corners) and Mingus (Mingus Ah Um) first. If you like those two, then Dolphy's ideas here will make a lot more sense.Onto the music: this isn't really a free jazz record, as in a bunch of instruments all playing at the same time without reference to harmony or rhythm. Every theme is composed (with strange, but very catchy melodies) and despite the fact that the improvisation goes all over the place, it somehow manages to stay entirely within the context set by the composition. The solos all seem to make perfect sense and sound completely natural. Dolphy is terrific both as a composer and an instrumentalist -- bass clarinet on the first two tracks, flute on "Gazzelloni", and alto saxophone on the last two tracks. Freddie Hubbard, a guy known primarily for playing hard bop, fits in really well here. And the rhythm section is stellar and downright telepathic: Bobby Hutcherson's spacy vibes, Richard Davis's solid yet stretchy bass playing, and Tony Williams's hyper-aware drumming. There's a classic sequence in "Hat and Beard" when all three engage in an amazing percussion discussion.This was one of the first jazz albums I bought as a rock fan who enjoyed Frank Zappa and King Crimson. I was hooked instantly, and to this day it remains one of my very favorite jazz albums. Even in a catalogue as star-studded as Blue Note, this is a milestone. If you like Out to Lunch, other records you may appreciate are Andrew Hill's Point of Departure (with Dolphy, Williams, and Davis) and Bobby Hutcherson's Dialogue (with Hutcherson, Davis, and Hubbard).

Giant Steps was recorded right around the time as another classic featuring Coltrane's playing, Miles Davis's Kind of Blue. The two albums couldn't be different - one is mellow, laid-back, introverted, and the other is exuberant and explosive.Up until this point Coltrane had recorded quite a few albums under his name, but Giant Steps was only the second (after Blue Train) to focus primarily on his own compositions. Unlike Blue Train, which was recorded almost two years earlier and fit comfortably in the then-mainstream hard bop style, Giant Steps saw Coltrane taking elements of bebop and pushing them as far as they could go. So you get plenty of dense, chord-oriented improvisation at fast tempos.That aspect of the music probably makes this album appealing to musicians, but the album's catchy melodies and more generally Coltrane's gift for focused improvisation reaches out to plenty of casual fans. It's one of his most popular albums. There are of course the aforementioned "studies" of difficult chord progressions at fast tempos - "Giant Steps" and "Countdown" (which opens with a fiery saxophone-drums duet). There are also several mellower explorations - the blues "Cousin Mary" and the almost Monkish "Syeeda's Song Flute". And "Naima", recorded about half a year after the other tunes, is one of Coltrane's most beautiful ballads - it's such a lovely melody that Coltrane refrains from improvising, playing it pretty straight, bracketing an exquisite meditation by pianist Wynton Kelly. He'd play "Naima" for the rest of his career - in 1961 with Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet, in the mid-60s with his classic quartet, and in 1966 with Pharoah Sanders. Another tune from this album that he would revisit is the blistering closer, "Mr. P.C." - this version is relatively short, but sometimes it would stretch to over half an hour in concert.It seems like the alternate takes get a mixed review here. I don't listen to them as much as I do to the original album, but they're interesting to have and shed light on Coltrane's thinking as a musician. Some of them predate the actual Giant Steps album by 2 months and are effectively a dry run.The sound, as with many Atlantic recordings from the 50s and early 60s, is not that great; compare it to the richness and warmth of Coltrane's Prestige, Blue Note and Impulse! Recordings.To wrap up: a few of the other reviews compare this album to Sonny Rollins's Saxophone Colossus - recorded almost three years earlier, also with a quartet, also featuring pianist Tommy Flanagan, and also making a reference to "bigness" in the title. I think those comparisons are spot on - each album represents a major milestone in the development of modern tenor saxophone playing. Though some of Coltrane's other Atlantic albums are probably better, this one is essential listening.

Of the two post-Roger Waters studio albums made by Pink Floyd, this is clearly the superior effort. David Gilmour and Bob Ezrin were trying very hard to replicate 70s Floyd on Momentary Lapse, but Division Bell is a more satisfying and relaxed effort. Only a few moments ("Keep Talking", "What Do You Want From Me") consciously mimic earlier Floyd efforts.Overall, the sound of this album echoes the more collective Floyd sound in the early 70s rather than the Waters-driven visions of the late 70s. There's a more modern sound, but much of the stuff here sounds like it could have cropped up on Obscured by Clouds, Meddle or Atom Heart Mother. Rick Wright makes a welcome return as a composer, contributing to approximately half the songs.The best parts of the album lie in the beginning (the two instrumentals, "Poles Apart") and the end ("Keep Talking", "Lost for Words", "High Hopes"). The U2-ish "Take It Back" and "Coming Back to Life" are probably too upbeat and poppy for many Floyd fans, but quite enjoyable in their own right. The two duds are the bland "A Great Day for Freedom" and the turgid "Wearing the Inside Out".One last word - if nothing else, check out "High Hopes" - a Floyd classic, one of the best tunes in the Floyd canon. Maybe this album doesn't match the heights of Floyd's best work in the 60s and 70s, but it ends their career on a solid note.

Though Rush experimented with writing epics on their previous album, this is the one where it all clicked. From the opening whoosh of the synthesizer (its first appearance on a Rush record) to the thundering close of &quot;Grand Finale&quot;, the title suite is a great slab of heavy progressive rock -- you don't even need to take the Rand-influenced lyrics seriously to enjoy it. Side 2, filled with more of the Zeppelinesque hard rock of their early period, is less exciting -- with the exception of &quot;Something for Nothing&quot; and the drug-addled &quot;Passage to Bangkok&quot;, the songs are mostly forgettable. No matter; this is a CD you buy for the first half.

If you like Rush's AOR hits, they're here -- &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Red Barchetta&quot;, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;, and &quot;The Trees&quot;. They're not particularly different from the studio versions so this set isn't essential for the casual fan; but the live version of &quot;Xanadu&quot; is incredible, and a few other surprises (&quot;Beneath Between and Behind&quot;, &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot;) spice things up. Out of Rush's first 3 live albums, this one will probably please the most people.

This album followed the footsteps of Permanent Waves but improved upon it in almost every aspect. The songwriting is tighter and more memorable; the first four songs are AOR staples to this day. &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Yyz&quot; stand out in particular. While these four are great songs (though perhaps suffering from oversaturation on the airwaves), the second half of the album is equally strong and maybe has longer-lasting appeal. The epic &quot;Camera Eye&quot; is great, as is &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; and the new-wave influenced &quot;Vital Signs&quot;. If you're going to like anything by Rush, this is the place to start.

The first half of this album continues the style of Rush's first two albums -- Zeppelin-esque hard rock. &quot;Bastille Day&quot; is another furious rocker. &quot;Lakeside Park&quot; is a pretty ballad and maybe the most tasteful thing Rush recorded in the early days. &quot;I Think I'm Going Bald&quot; is quite stupid. On the second side, though, the band moves on to new territory with its first two stabs at progressive rock epics. &quot;The Necromancer&quot; is pretty dire, with Neil Peart's earnest, oh-so-serious narration and the painfully bad Tolkein lyrics. &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth&quot; is more listenable but comes off as too fragmented. The band would do far better in this style on the next few studio albums.

This is generally considered an accurate document of what Rush sounded like in the mid-70s. The set list is essentially a best-of from their first four albums. Sound quality is actually quite decent as long as you don't expect the studio-doctored slickness of later live albums. Spirited performances of &quot;2112&quot; and &quot;What You're Doing&quot; are standouts. But for some reason, the rest of the music doesn't really click. &quot;By-Tor and the Snowdog&quot; runs far, far too long and most of the other tunes don't offer enough to distinguish themselves from superior studio versions. This one is for completists and hardcore fans of the band's early period.

This album continues on the same path as Signals, but with a harsher, more electronic sound. The tone of the lyrics is bleaker than on most Rush albums and Alex Lifeson turns in some of the most inspired, economical guitar playing of his career. (The brief solo on &quot;Afterimage&quot; is beautiful.) Though their occasionally excessive virtuosity is toned down here the songwriting is at a high level; the only duds are &quot;The Body Electric&quot; and the silly &quot;Red Lenses&quot;. Two AOR hits (&quot;Red Sector A&quot; and &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot;) as well as several forgotten classics (&quot;Afterimage&quot;, &quot;Kid Gloves&quot;) make this one of the better Rush albums. People who don't like the synth-heavy Signals won't find much of interest here, though.

With the addition of drummer Neil Peart, the band steps it up a few notches. There's a dramatic improvement in the drumming, and the lyrics improve (though the Randroid &quot;Anthem&quot; is embarrassing, and the fantasy lyrics of &quot;Rivendell&quot; and &quot;By-Tor&quot; haven't dated well). The band uses more dynamic contrast: acoustic guitars make an appearance on a few of the songs, and even on all-electric tunes like &quot;Fly by Night&quot; they exercise much more subtlety. They can still rock hard, though -- check out &quot;Anthem&quot; and the superb, concise &quot;Beneath, Between and Behind&quot;. If it wasn't for the soporific &quot;Rivendell&quot; and the somewhat aimless &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot;, this would be a much better album.

The band's sixth studio album continues in the heavy progressive rock style of _2112_ and _A Farewell to Kings_, without the erratic songwriting. The sound is a tad slicker, with more prominent synths, and is as close as they ever got to sounding like Yes. The highlights of the album are the AOR hit &quot;The Trees&quot; and the fusionish instrumental &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;. The title suite has more of Peart's sci-fi goofiness but the music is mostly excellent. &quot;Circumstances&quot; is a pleasant throwaway similar to their other short tunes from this period. After this one the lure of airplay would lead to a concise synth-laden sound, but this is their last, and best, album in the progressive rock style.

Grace Under Pressure is Rush at its most electronic -- to some fans, it seemed like synthesizers were drowning out the rest of the instruments. The next two albums, while still keyboard-heavy, used them in a more spacious, orchestral fashion. Instead of sounding abrasive, the synths were absorbed into a slick arena-rock production. Power Windows is the first album in this style, with mixed results. Sometimes the music sounds too sterile or bombastic. There's some good material here (&quot;The Big Money&quot;, &quot;Territories&quot;, &quot;Emotion Detector&quot;, and the classic &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot;) balanced out by some forgettable stuff. A good album nonetheless.

This album kicks off memorably with the dark synthesizer fanfare of &quot;Subdivisions&quot;; the rest of this album reflects that initial sound, with Rush's guitar-dominated sound retreating behind increasingly prominent synths. Some of the tunes here really work -- &quot;Subdivisions&quot;, &quot;The Weapon&quot;, and especially &quot;The Analog Kid&quot;. Other tunes are less successful -- &quot;Chemistry&quot; is downright embarrassing in terms of lyrics, &quot;Countdown&quot; is merely forgettable, and the ballad &quot;Losing It&quot; fizzles after a promising start. This album also includes Rush's only top 40 single, the catchy &quot;New World Man&quot;. Overall this is a good album but not among Rush's best. Fans of the older material may be turned off by the synthesizers, while people who dislike Geddy Lee's screeches on the 70s albums may find this CD to be more palatable.

Unless you're a Rush completist you can safely avoid this album. The songwriting is unremarkable and the lyrics are painfully bad (though the pseudointellectual nonsense of later albums is absent). &quot;In the Mood&quot; may be the most ridiculously goofy thing they ever recorded. The attempt to clone Zeppelin is pretty obvious and results in a bluesy sound on some tunes. Other than &quot;Finding My Way&quot; and &quot;Working Man&quot; (where they demonstrate their developing instrumental prowess), this one is mostly forgettable.

Like Power Windows this album goes for a sweeping, orchestral sound. The production isn't as sterile, though, and the songwriting is far better. The lyrics have a more personal, less global focus. (&quot;Tai Shan&quot; makes up for so-so music with some of Peart's most heartfelt writing.) Aside from the bombastic &quot;Lock &amp; Key&quot; the songs are all good and often great. This album features the forgotten classic &quot;High Water&quot; as well as the AOR hits &quot;Time Stand Still&quot; and &quot;Force Ten&quot;. Hold Your Fire is definitely a highlight of Rush's catalogue and maybe the most mature album they've ever done.

Though it lacks the rawness of All the World's a Stage and doesn't feature as many radio hits as Exit Stage Left, this may be the best of Rush's first three live albums. The 80s albums have been criticized as overproduced, but here the material comes alive. The overdubbed, harmony vocals that started to crop up on Power Windows are absent here, eliminating an annoying element from the music. The live &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot; is incredible; &quot;Mission&quot; and &quot;Turn the Page&quot; sound far better than they did in the studio. The album also includes &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; and an extended live version of &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;. For casual fans, this excellent set may be all they need from Rush's synth-heavy era.

Mingus was on a roll in 1959, recording four of his greatest albums, and if Mingus Dynasty doesn't reach the peaks ofBlues and RootsorMingus Ah Um, it gets pretty darn close.Sonically it's quite similar to Ah Um, though with a larger ensemble. Booker Ervin, John Handy, Jimmy Knepper, and Dannie Richmond return fromt hat album, but Roland Hanna takes over the piano chair and this time the group includes a trumpet (either Don Ellis or Richard Williams). Jerome Richardson plays flute and baritone sax, and Teddy Charles adds vibes to a few of the tracks. The last tune ("Put Me in That Dungeon") adds cellos to great effect.As on Ah Um, the ensemble explores a wide range of styles, maybe even wider. It really shows off Mingus's breadth as a composer. "Slop" is another gospel-jazz piece in the mode of "Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting" with a fantastic piano "sermon" by Hanna. "Diane" starts out with a dissonant, nearly orchestral introduction before settling into a gorgeous piano trio section. (This tune appears as "Alice in Wonderland" on the Mingus albumJazz Portraits.) The album includes Mingus's first recorded explorations of the Duke Ellington canon, with "Things Ain't What They Used to Be" and a majestic "Mood Indigo". "Far Wells Mill Valley" is another semi-orchestral piece, almost cinematic in scope. "Gunslinging Bird" has an intense, hypnotic riff.This is one of my favorite Mingus albums, especially because it highlights his abilities as a composer and arranger (though his genius as a bassist is also on display, especially on "Mood Indigo"). If you like Blues & Roots and Mingus Ah Um, this is a logical next step in your Mingus collection.

This is a great album to play at parties. Joe Zawinul played piano for one of the funkiest soul jazz combos of the 60s (Cannonball Adderley's Quintet), so it was just a matter of time before he'd bring the GROOVE into Weather Report. And on Sweetnighter, the third in a line of classic studio recordings, he does it in a big way. The experimental, dark sound of the early albums is abandoned for a more celebratory, accessible sound. The album starts with a 13 minute slab of quasi-Latin jazz-funk, Zawinul's "Boogie Woogie Waltz" -- a brilliant monument to layered grooves that builds and builds to one of the band's catchiest, most memorable themes. "125th Street Congress" is similar, though less directed and even funkier. The shorter numbers aren't quite as earth-shaking but still stand high in the Weather Report canon. "Adios" is the last in a line of great Zawinul tone poems, following in the steps of "In a Silent Way" and "Orange Lady" if not quite reaching their level. "Non-Stop Home" is Wayne Shorter's take on the funk, while Miroslav Vitous's "Will" is a beautiful piece of floating melody over interlocking rhythms. And indeed, on this album, every member of the band is part of a huge rhythmic machine. Shorter plays some great saxophone but now he's less of a soloist and more of a colorist; Zawinul doesn't dominate the band's sound yet, but uses synthesizers melodically for the first time. (He used a synth on "Unknown Soldier", but that was purely as a sound effect.)This is the high point of Weather Report's studio career and one of the greatest fusion recordings.(This review is based on the previous edition of Sweetnighter, from the 90s, which sounds perfectly fine to my ears.)

This is a great album to play at parties.

(If you like these, by the way, check out Kenny Dorham's album Una Mas, which features an acoustic groover with similar ideas.) The shorter numbers aren't quite as earth-shaking but still stand high in the Weather Report canon. &quot;Adios&quot; is the last in a line of great Zawinul tone poems, following in the steps of &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Orange Lady&quot; if not quite reaching their level. &quot;Non-Stop Home&quot; is Wayne Shorter's take on the funk, while Miroslav Vitous's &quot;Will&quot; is a beautiful piece of floating melody over interlocking rhythms. And indeed, on this album, every member of the band is part of a huge rhythmic machine. Shorter plays some great saxophone but now he's less of a soloist and more of a cog in that machine; Zawinul doesn't dominate the band's sound yet, but adds a synthesizer to his keyboard sound for the first time. This is the high point of Weather Report's career and one of the greatest fusion recordings.

This is the album which made Weather Report a hit with the public, largely on the strength of the catchy, brilliantly orchestrated &quot;Birdland&quot;. The rest of this much-hyped album follows a similar pattern -- catchy melodies, concise songs, and a very slick production. The tunes themselves are well-crafted but can't help sounding like what you'd hear played in the supermarket. (The synthesizer arrangements are also cheesy at times.) Zawinul's ballad &quot;A Remark You Made&quot; sounds a bit too sentimental and the Wayne Shorter tunes are nothing special. The main redeeming feature here is Jaco Pastorius, who more than makes up for Shorter's shortfall with two excellent tunes (&quot;Teen Town&quot; and the post-bop &quot;Havona&quot;) as well as reinventing the bass guitar on practically every track. A lot of people may find this to be an ideal introduction to Weather Report and fusion music in general, but some will just hear lightweight smooth jazz and wonder what the fuss is about. Caveat emptor!

Live Evil is a little strange; unlike the other electric Miles releases of the 70s it combines studio and live recordings -- occasionally on the same track! About 80% of the music (tracks 1 and 4 on the first disc, 2 and 3 on the second disc) comes from a December 1970 engagement at the Cellar Door Club in DC. The other 20% comes from various studio recordings.I'm personally of the opinion that, with a few important exceptions, Miles's studio recordings post-BB are pretty unsatisfying. The short ambient tracks ("Little Church", "Nem Um Talvez" and "Selim") are little more than filler. "Double Image" has more to offer, but doesn't offer much aside from some fine, screaming John McLaughlin guitar.The meat of the album lies in the live material. The band here is Miles on trumpet, Gary Bartz on saxophones, Keith Jarrett on organ and electric piano, Michael Henderson on electric bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, Airto on percussion, and special-guest-for-this-evening-only John McLaughlin. Jarrett is on record complaining that McLaughin threw the group off its groove. I don't hear it. DeJohnette and Henderson lock into some ridiculously funky backbeats (particularly on "What I Say" and the first 4 minutes of "Sivad"), and Jarrett is more than happy to play his characteristic mix of gospelly rollicking and abstract weirdness. Near the end of the first medley on disc 2, acoustic purist Jarrett plays a beautiful solo improvisation on organ and electric piano. McLaughlin is as good as you'd expect for this period -- just months before his Mahavishnu Orchestra debuted on record, laying down some crunchy, heavy guitar. Gary Bartz was one of Miles's best saxophonists post-Wayne Shorter (he plays both alto and soprano here). And as for the Dark Magus himself: he plays both regular and wah-wah trumpet, but his chops are still at a very high level unlike some later electric recordings.Like a lot of live recordings, there are moments when the music loses focus. Nevertheless, the live portions of this disc easily justify the purchase. It straddles the divide between his earlier, jazzier electric recordings and the guitar-based funk of the mid-70s: a good third stop after you've checked out Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way.

This April 1970 concert is the second of three 2 CD sets featuring Miles Davis at the Fillmore, the other two being It's About that Time (March '70) and At Fillmore (June '70). It is also the second in terms of musical quality; while it doesn't have the disjointed edits of At Fillmore, the replacement of saxophonist Wayne Shorter by the young and inexperienced Steve Grossman is a serious drag on the music. Grossman's playing on the soprano is unimaginative and in all likelihood you will just listen to the rhythm section during his solos. The rhythm section of Dave Holland, Chick Corea and Jack DeJohnette is still really exciting, whether they are riding a groove or engaging in free jazz conversations. Miles plays plenty of searing upper register trumpet on tunes like &quot;Directions&quot; but also takes a breather for a gorgeous duet with Corea (&quot;I Fall in Love too Easily&quot;). The performances aren't quite as tight or focused as those on It's About That Time, but they still burn. If you like this electric, intense approach to free jazz, then you will probably want to pick up Black Beauty.

This is one of the strangest bands Miles Davis ever led -- a transitional group featuring guitar, keyboards, electric sitar, saxophone, bass, congas, tabla and drums. The musicians are constrained to producing sound and adding to the rhythmic density, so nobody gets to shine individually. (The saxophonist and keyboardist are especially lame.) When this works this band sounds great; &quot;Rated X&quot; justifies buying this set, starting from a rhythmic babble to a swelling wave of funk, until Mike Henderson enters in the middle of Miles's wah wah trumpet solo... awesome. The band also cooks on the other 1972 pieces, &quot;Black Satin&quot; and &quot;Ife&quot; (though the later runs waaaaay too long at 28 minutes). On the minus side they sound pretty wimpy on the more rockin' Jack Johnson material; they should have stuck to the droning, spacy stuff. None of the musicians except Miles and Henderson seem to develop any individual personality either, and the shaky sound means Miles is difficult to hear. It's not surprising that Miles would soon ditch this group for the raw, primal sound you can hear on Dark Magus, Agharta and Pangaea. Basically, if you like On the Corner, you'll definitely want this; if you hate it, this will be garbage to you. I personally like to put this exciting but flawed record into the CD player once in a while.

These June 1970 performances are the third of three 2 CD sets of Miles Davis at the Fillmore. The other two are It's About That Time and Black Beauty (recorded at the Fillmore West). It features similar material to the other two, and features the same band as Black Beauty with the addition of Keith Jarrett on electric organ.Like other Miles Davis albums of the 70s, At Fillmore features a lot of Teo Macero's tape manipulation and splicing. But whereas on Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way this technique was very successful, the edits here take music that was never coherent to begin with and make it even more confusing. At Fillmore was edited into four 25 minute medleys from the four sets Miles played on June 17-20. (Titled &quot;Wednesday Miles&quot;, &quot;Thursday Miles&quot;, etc.) This band could get cooking when they worked into a groove but who really needs a 40 second except of &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;? Another drawback of this recording is Keith Jarrett -- his playing is normally impeccable but here he throws off the equilibrium of the rhythm section. His organ freakouts are pointless and while it's amusing to hear him and Chick Corea duel on electric keyboards, the novelty wears off pretty fast. Most of Steve Grossman's soprano sax solos were edited out: not a big loss. Miles still plays great, and the longer performances, like on &quot;It's About That Time&quot; or &quot;Willie Nelson&quot;, are the real highlights. The talented musicians are somehow able to raise this music above mediocrity, but not by much. This is one of the weakest of the 70s Miles Davis releases and shouldn't be picked up until after you've heard It's About That Time and Black Beauty.

In 1963, the Kelly/Chambers/Cobb rhythm section packed up and left, leaving Miles Davis without a band. Despite being at an age when most musicians would rather sit on their laurels and play on some giants of jazz tour, he decided to assemble a new working band. This CD shows that assembly in progress. The three ballads were recorded in LA with George Coleman (tenor sax), Victor Feldman (piano), Ron Carter (bass), and Frank Butler (drums). &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot; is very different from Louis Armstrong's version -- Davis's trumpet playing is much sadder, merging abstraction and the blues. But the real treasures in the set are the three tunes recorded one month later with Carter, Coleman, and two younger musicians: pianist Herbie Hancock and drumming prodigy Tony Williams. Williams, only 17 years old here, generates an incredible level of excitement on &quot;Joshua&quot; and the title track. These may be the most exciting up-tempo tracks Davis had recorded since &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot; and &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;. The quintet with Coleman, Hancock, Carter and Williams would soon evolve into one of the trumpeter's greatest groups, and this is where they got started.

There are those times in jazz when everything is pattering along, nice and pleasant, and then one musician starts playing and BOOM everything that's happened for the previous few minutes seems totally trivial. &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; (track #1 of this CD) is one of those times. Miles, Hank Mobley, and Wynton all play fine swinging solos; then John Coltrane plays an incredible solo at the end of which you ask yourself &quot;Hank who?&quot;Most of this CD features Miles's working band of the time, a quintet with Mobley in the tenor sax chair and the superbly groovy rhythm section of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. Mobley was a fine hard bop player, as some of his albums for the Blue Note label attest to (check out Soul Station, Roll Call or Workout), but he sounds a little uncomfortable here. The music looks back behind the progressive sounds Kind of Blue and Milestones to the mid-50s quintet, though with a few exceptions it doesn't have the spark of that group. The exceptions include the two tracks with Coltrane (&quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Teo&quot;), whose intense spiralling improvisations look ahead to those on &quot;Ole&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot;; the one track with Philly Joe Jones (&quot;Blues #2&quot;), where Miles and Philly Joe trade choruses almost telepathically; and &quot;Pfrancing&quot; (aka &quot;No Blues&quot;), where the rhythm section does what they do best. The ballads, played by Miles on mute, are a little anemic.The music on this album will please almost any jazz fan and includes some classic performances, but there are quite a few Miles Davis recordings that are more essential. If you want to hear the quintet (minus guests) at their best, check out the recently issued Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk.

This posthumous release isn't as well-known - or as well-regarded - as the 1987 Copenhagen concerts released on Anniversary and Serenity. But in terms of beautiful, sensitive ballad playing, it's among the best Getz I've heard. With the exception of the Jim McNeely original "There We Go", this is a slow-paced program. Four of the ballads are standards, ranging from the wistful ("How Long Has This Been Going On", "Spring Is Here") to the upbeat ("Blue Skies"). It's the fifth - Marc Johnson's "Antigny" - that is my personal highlight. It's more abstract than the standard ballads, but generates a kind of mystic tenderness that gets me every time. The supporting cast here - McNeely, Johnson, and Billy Hart - is top notch.If you love this recording, as I'm sure most will, I would check out its companion release, Pure Getz, which is more oriented toward Stan's bebop playing. Both are must-hears for fans of his playing.

At the 1958 Newport Festival, Miles Davis was leading one of his most celebrated groups: a sextet consisting of John Coltrane (tenor sax), Cannonball Adderley (alto sax), Bill Evans (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), and Jimmy Cobb (drums). This same lineup would record Kind of Blue within a year. The results here aren't quite as magical. Coltrane, at the peak of his sheets-of-sound period, is incredible -- he tears through the songs with ferocity. Just listen to &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot;. Bill Evans, on the other hand, sounds a little out of place on the bop tunes that compose the bulk of this set; his reflective, abstract playing doesn't fit in as well in this context. Adderley and Davis play well though I wouldn't call this performance a milestone for either one. The sextet also tackle a few of the tunes a bit faster than they can handle, and they bungle the theme to &quot;Ah Leu Cha&quot;. But this is still a very good recording of a great group, and worth buying for the hardcore Davis aficionado.

This is the 5th album by the &quot;Santana band&quot;, but by this point the only guys remaining from the Woodstock lineup were Carlos, drummer Mike Shrieve, and percussionist Chepito Areas. They were joined by two (!) keyboardists (Richard Kermode and Tom Coster), percussionist Armando Peraza, bassist Doug Rauch and vocalist Leon Thomas. Carlos's chief collaborators in the band were Coster and Shrieve, who pulled the band in a decidedly jazzy direction. The overall sound is even mellower than Caravanserai and pretty far removed from the classic Santana sound.Santana was never a great songwriting group, and so the meat of the album lies in the instrumental pieces. There's a beautiful arrangement by Alice Coltrane (&quot;Going Home&quot;), a serene interpretation of John Coltrane's &quot;Welcome&quot; (listen to Trane's original on Kulu Se Mama, it is heartbreakingly beautiful!), Chepito's very cool &quot;Samba de Sausalito&quot;, and an intriguing cover of Herbie Mann's &quot;Mother Africa&quot; with the angular soprano sax playing of Jules Broussard. In addition, &quot;Flame Sky&quot; reunites Carlos and John McLaughlin in a fiery duel that easily exceeds anything they did on their collaboration Love Devotion and Surrender. The vocal tunes are mostly R&amp;B-ish with the smooth vocals of Leon Thomas (I wonder why he didn't contribute any of his trademark yodelling), plus Flora Purim's classic voice on &quot;Yours Is the Light&quot;.This isn't an unqualified triumph, but people who like jazz-rock or this phase of Santana's career need to pick it up. Caravanserai is a stronger album, though, so check out that one first.

This was a compilation of early material that Pink Floyd released in 1971. Five of the tracks are from their first three albums, and the rest are assorted singles and b-sides. The real reason to pick up Relics is to get the two early, classic Floyd singles, "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play". These are two of the best tunes the band recorded with Syd Barrett at the helm. "Paintbox" is a very nice Rick Wright tune, quite pop-oriented and less psychedelic than his 2 tunes on Saucerful of Secrets. "Biding My Time" was unreleased until this compilation: a bluesy tune with Roger Waters on vocals, Rick Wright on trombone and a scorching David Gilmour solo at the end. "Julia Dream" is a gloomy but ultimately inconsequential track. (Very weird lyrics, though -- not sure what is up with the scaly armadillo.) "Careful with That Axe Eugene" is a classic early Floyd track, though live versions from the '68-'71 period tend to be much better. Check out Ummagumma or Live at Pompeii. There isn't much to say about the 5 album tracks, except that the band could have picked better tunes from More and A Saucerful of Secrets. You'll probably want to hear the original albums anyway.This disc definitely worth it for most of the tracks not available on the regular albums -- especially the two singles with Syd.

This is probably the most popular, and arguably the best, of Pink Floyd's pre-Dark Side albums. (Possible exception for Piper, depending on your tastes.) The band's sound started coming together on Atom Heart Mother, but things really clicked on (parts) of Meddle.The album opens with the fierce (mostly) instrumental rocker, "One of the These Days". A live favorite both before and after Roger Waters's departure from the band, it contains a classic bassline, some naaasty wailing by Dave Gilmour on guitar, and a rare vocal by Nick Mason threatening to cut you into little pieces.The album closes with what may be the best track of Pink Floyd's career, the epic "Echoes". Starting with a ghostly "ping", it contains several lengthy instrumental sections and some haunting singing by Gilmour and Rick Wright. The music fades into a "noise" section, then comes back to life in a fantastic, explosive climax. It's more raw and loose than Floyd's later studio-perfect work, but If you like Pink Floyd's instrumental side you will definitely enjoy it.The four tracks in the middle of the album range from OK to good, but are really inconsequential compared to the first and last tracks. "Fearless" is a nice upbeat track, "A Pillow of Winds" is a pleasant love ballad, "San Tropez" is a cheerful (with vocals by Waters, of all people) vaguely jazzy tune, and "Seamus" is a blues with a barking dog solo. It's almost like the band had to lighten the mood and intensity before and after the two best tracks.If you consider Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here to be the best of Pink Floyd's studio albums, then this album is an absolute must. It contains some of their finest work -- the four band members working perfectly as a unit with their egos in check.

There are over a thousand reviews for this album and it's tough to find anything new to say about it. It's a great album of enjoyable music, probably Pink Floyd's most well-rounded recording and one that has held up strongly over the past 35 years. "Time", "Brain Damage", "Us and Them", "The Great Gig" - these are all classics. Perhaps the only real drawback is that we've all heard each a million times; they can't help being overplayed.My only additional comment is that, despite being lumped in with other popular Pink Floyd albums of the mid- and late 1970s, it is stylistically more similar to the early 1970s albums Atom Heart Mother, Meddle and Obscured by Clouds. The key difference from earlier albums is the presence of Roger Waters's dark, cynical lyrics (though the extreme bitterness of later efforts isn't here yet). But the music, just as on those earlier albums, is a full collaboration between four band members - not the effort of one man, with a few companions filling in as session musicians. That would change on subsequent albums, and in my opinion not for the better.

Atom Heart Mother was the album where Floyd's classic sound really started maturing and coming together. Though it retains the experimental spirit of Ummagumma, the results here are much more focused and enjoyable.The album's reputation for "weirdness" largely comes from the lengthy suite that takes up the first half. Though the idea of adding brass orchestration and a large choir to a Floyd piece might lead some to dismiss this as a pretentious rock-classical crossover piece, it's just too eccentric and entertaining. David Gilmour offers some fantastic guitar playing, there's a great "funk" section, and the melodies are first-rate. It's not quite a masterpiece on the level of "Echoes", but I think fans of Floyd's instrumental side will find a lot to enjoy here.The second half of the album is more "normal". Waters, Gilmour, and Wright each offer a tune, of which Gilmour's "Fat Old Sun" (classic guitar solo) and Wright's "Summer '68" are the best. Pink Floyd wasn't always dour and angry! The album closes with the thirteen minute instrumental "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast": pleasantly melodic but (perhaps) lightweight playing by the band while a recording of their roadie making breakfast plays in the background. Marmalade, I like marmalade.Fans of the atmospheric soundscapes of Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here will probably like this album. Just don't expect angry or political lyrics by Roger Waters; there isn't any of that here, just interesting music.One last comment: the album cover is a classic.

With Syd Barrett's departure, Pink Floyd experienced a creative crisis. They had a new guitarist/vocalist in David Gilmour, but needed someone to step up in the composition department. Neither Rick Wright nor Roger Waters were skilled songwriters like Barrett. That said, this album is pretty good and has the first hints of the classic sound Pink Floyd would develop in the early 70s.Of the 3 Waters compositions, "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" is by far the best -- a vaguely Middle-Eastern melody, whispered vocals by Waters, and very spacy playing by Wright and Gilmour. Live versions of this tune, as you can hear on Ummagumma or Live in Pompeii, would be much more adventurous. "Let There Be More Light" is a pretty good tune (with silly lyrics), while "Corporal Clegg" (Waters's first anti-war lyric) is annoying. Of the two Wright compositions, the nostalgic psych-pop "Remember a Day" is better; "See Saw" isn't as good, though it's not nearly as bad as some Floyd fans would have you believe. The only collaborative composition on this album, the title track, is arguably the best thing on the album. Lots of out-there collective improvisation by the band, leading to some pretty wild playing, and finally concluding with a very churchy chord progression and some choral voices. A classic -- one of their best achievements, though like "Set the Controls", live versions would be stretched much further out. Finally, the album concludes with Syd Barrett's final contribution to Floyd, "Jugband Blues". It's a much darker tune than most of his contributions to Piper and makes for an enigmatic farewell.Saucerful of Secrets isn't as good as Piper or Floyd's early 70s albums. That said, it contains two of their most important tunes ("Saucerful", "Set the Controls") and some other enjoyable stuff. If you're exploring early Floyd, you will need to pick it up. Three and a half stars.

This sophomore effort by the Beatles followed the same format (some would say formula) of their debut: an eclectic mix of eight originals and six covers. At the same time, they went for an earthier, more rock'n'roll sound with less of Please Please Me's occasional schmaltz. &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, &quot;All I've Got to Do&quot; and the #1 hit &quot;All My Loving&quot; are great Lennon/McCartney originals; the best of the covers are Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and a rip-roaring version of &quot;Money&quot;. Paul's rendition of &quot;Til There Was You&quot; (from the musical The Music Man) is a pleasant surprise. Though A Hard Day's Night would be the crowning achievement of the Beatles' early days, With the Beatles is a great album and an essential part of any music collection.

This was Floyd's first album recorded completely without Syd Barrett. Unlike most of their other recordings, it was made in a very short time period for a movie soundtrack.Not everything works -- "Ibiza Bar" and "The Nile Song" are really lame heavy metal songs. "The Crying Song" is aimless and pointless. "Up the Khyber" and "Party Sequence" are pleasant (but not much more than that) percussion pieces that probably made a lot more sense in the context of the movie. (One of those has a cool piano-drums battle, though.) "Cirrus Minor"... eh. "More Blues" and "Spanish Piece" are inconsequential.Now on to the good stuff. "Cymbaline" and "Green Is the Colour" (a beautiful ballad) would be live favorites for Floyd in the '69-'71 period, and would play an important role in "The Man / The Journey" concept concerts. "Main Theme" and "Dramatic Theme" are cool, quasi-exotic instrumentals. "Quicksilver" is one of the spacy, experimental pieces Pink Floyd recorded around this time. These tunes all justify getting this CD.I would suggest this as one of the least essential Floyd purchases. But, if you are exploring their earlier recordings, you will probably want to pick this up after you get Ummagumma and Saucerful of Secrets.

This is an album you have to listen to with &quot;1963 ears&quot;. Perhaps it doesn't always mesh with our 21st century musical values, but on that scene this album of 14 up-beat tunes was like a blast of fresh air. The format of 6 covers and 8 originals would be a template for their next few albums.&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; is surely the best of the bunch, and still ranks as one of the greatest rock and roll songs ever recorded, while &quot;Please Please Me&quot; rocketed them to the top of the charts in Britain. But there are other treasures here. John's passionate singing on &quot;Anna&quot; is wonderful, and who could forget the definite performance of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;? At a few points they lay the cheese on too thick (especially &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;... yecch) but after all, this was just 1963 and better things lay ahead. What you have here is infectious, toe-tapping rock and roll. Please Please Me is a must for any fan of 60s rock and good music in general.

This was Floyd's last album of the 60s, and consisted of two LPs. The first was a sort of live retrospective, consisting of extended versions of four classic Floyd tunes from this period. The second was combination of studio experiments by the individual Floyd members, each doing his own thing.The live album is great. The original versions of each tune were pretty good, but during the '69-'71 Floyd was at their best in concert and this is the only official release (besides the film Live at Pompeii) to document that fact. There isn't any of the slick, studio-reproduction aspect that you hear on Delicate Sound of Thunder or Pulse. Instead the band expands and explores the material. For example, "Careful With That Axe Eugene" is much more intense than the studio version, and "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" has a very spacy organ solo in the middle. People who expect tunes with catchy melodies will probably be disappointed, but those that like the more adventurous and instrumental side of Pink Floyd will be very pleased. If you like this stuff, look for other ("unofficial") recordings from the '69-'71 period -- some of those are even better than this one.The studio album is one of the worst things they ever did. Each member of Floyd gets half an LP, and they mostly use it for avant-garde experiments. I've got nothing against avant-garde experimentation, but Pink Floyd had much better experiments elsewhere. Wright offers a quasi-classical multi-layered keyboard composition ("Sysyphus"), Mason a drums & percussion piece with electronic effects ("The Grand Vizier's Garden Party" -- definitely the worst thing on this album), and Gilmour a guitar-oriented composition ("The Narrow Way"). Waters's section consists of a lovely acoustic/pastoral ballad ("Grantchester Meadows") and a strange vocal-effects collage ("Several Species of Small Furry Animals..."). I'd say that "Grantchester Meadows" is the only good thing on the studio album, though Part 3 of "The Narrow Way" (the song part) is OK.This is still one of the first "early Floyd" albums you should pick up (after Piper), but I am guessing that in the long run you will probably only listen to the live half.

Out of the five albums the Beatles recorded before Rubber Soul, this is easily the best. Released as a soundtrack to their first movie at the height of Beatlemania, it was also the first Beatles album to feature *only* Lennon/McCartney originals and no covers. (How many other rock musicians released albums of only original material in 1964? Bob Dylan is the only other one I can think of.) None of the 13 originals are filler. &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and the beautiful ballad &quot;And I Love Her&quot; are the best known, but many of these songs are among their strongest. &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, &quot;If I Fell&quot; (beautiful three-part harmonies), &quot;Any Time at All&quot; and &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; are personal favorites. Like other early Beatles songs, love is the main theme of the lyrics -- but there's a growing sophistication and emotional depth on songs like &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;. If you're a Beatles fan, A Hard Day's Night is a must.

This is the album that put Pink Floyd on the map. It sounds quite different from their later albums -- at this point, the sound is dominated by guitarist/vocalist Syd Barrett and his whimsical psychedelic pop compositions. Also, when we think of Pink Floyd today, we think of long guitar solos; but here, the key instrumental sound is Rick Wright's farfisa organ.The songs themselves are very catchy, with eccentric and often child-like lyrics. The closing trilogy of songs ("Chapter 24", "The Scarecrow", and my personal favorite "Bike") is perhaps the best part of the album. "Astronomy Domine" is different than the other Barrett-penned tunes, with its space-rock lyrics, and it would survive Barrett's departure from the band. Roger Waters makes his vocal/composer debut on "Take Up Thy Stethoscope", which is awful and easily the worst thing on this CD. The two instrumental compositions, "Interstellar Overdrive" and "Pow R. Toc. H" (both composed the group) are the most obvious links to Pink Floyd's later cosmic excursions. There are better versions of "Overdrive" on bootlegs, but this one is pretty good.Overall, this is so different from later Floyd that fans coming from The Wall or even Dark Side of the Moon won't believe it's the same band (and might not like the results). That said, Syd Barrett was a gifted songwriter and the music the band produced under his leadership was great. Definitely recommended!

Sandwiched between two "core" Floyd albums (Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon), Obscured by Clouds is often overlooked by casual fans. In reality, most fans of those two albums would enjoy this more-than-solid LP.Stylistically, this album falls comfortably in the 1970-73 Floyd style. The collaborative spirit that characterized Floyd in the late 60s and 70s is fully present, with the only exception being that the results are packaged into a relatively compact form (no songs over 6 minutes in length).The songs with vocals are generally in a fairly straight-ahead rock style. "What's Uh... the Deal" is really the highlight here, a beautiful slightly folkish tune. Gilmour's "Childhood's End" anticipates "Time" stylistically, while Waters's "Free Four" (an otherwise unremarkable tune) foreshadows his later interest in darker themes. The two Rick Wright tunes are nice and pleasant if a little too soft-rockish for some fans.The instrumentals are also relatively straightforward, with little of the experimentation present on A Saucerful of Secrets or Ummagumma. "Obscured by Clouds" and "When You're In" were played together live and function as a fine intro. "Mudmen" is also great - a combination of psychedelic keyboards with intense, wailing guitar solos. (Clearly an antecedent for "Marooned", on The Division Bell.)Many fans of Pink Floyd's most popular albums will find lots of material to enjoy here. Recommended.

&quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; was the first Monk recording I ever heard. It's a bizarre composition, like a huge, lumbering elephant who had a bit too much to drink and is let loose in a skating rink. The behemoth rolls around clumsily, falling down, getting up, banging into the walls, you get the idea. When I heard it, I was hooked. Monk wouldn't have been able to pull it off without all-star accompanists; Sonny Rollins contributes a great solo, and Max Roach's drumming holds it all together. The other tunes are also wonderful, if a bit more normal: an eccentric blues (Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are), a solo rendition of &quot;I Surrender, Dear&quot;, the beautiful ballad &quot;Pannonica&quot; (where Monk doubles on celeste), and a bombastic interpretation of &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; with Max Roach on tympani. This is an essential jazz classic and one of Monk's best in a band setting. Pick up this, Monk and Coltrane, and Monk's Music and you will be sold on this great musician.

Most Floyd fans (but not this one) agree that the group did their best work from 1973 to 1979. What to make of the later albums under the Pink Floyd name is a lot more difficult. To some, Roger Waters was the heart and soul of the band; the Final Cut is a masterpiece, or close to it, and the less said about what came afterward the better. To others, the Final Cut was a hideous misstep and the following work was an appropriate return to the "true Floyd style."I don't really have a dog in that argument - I prefer my Floyd of the late 60s, early 70s vintage. Without getting into whether a "true Floyd style" really exists, this is a nice album that doesn't sound much like their previous work. Despite some stylistic similarities; a lot of the cheesy, late 70s glitz and bombast of The Wall is stripped away. What's left is largely a Waters solo album. The contributions by Nick Mason are negligible; Dave Gilmour offers some classic guitar solos ("The Fletcher Memorial Home" and "The Final Cut" are among his best) and a vocal on the awful "Not Now John". And though the arrangements are very nice (including some wild loud-soft dynamics - be careful with that volume knob), with the exception of an occasional saxophone or guitar solo there are few significant instrumental interludes.As far as Waters - he manages to avoid the over-the-top, high-concept pretentions of The Wall and The Pros & Cons of Hitch-hiking. There's lots of truly moving music here - "The Hero's Return", "The Gunner's Dream", "Paranoid Eyes", "Southampton Dock", "The Final Cut". "Two Suns of the Sunset" has some of the best lyrics he wrote under the Floyd moniker, mostly free of the excessive bitterness that often crept into his work.If you go into this album without expecting it to be Dark Side or Wish You Were Here part 2, there's a pretty good chance you will appreciate it.

Coltrane's Sound was recorded at the same October 1960 sessions as My Favorite Things. (Coltrane Plays the Blues also comes from these sessions.) Though it has never achieved the same popularity as MFT, in my opinion Coltrane's Sound is actually a better album! It comes from a period where Coltrane finally got a working band (McCoy Tyner, Steve Davis, Elvin Jones) together and was shifting direction away from the harmonic density of Giant Steps and "sheets of sound" toward modal improvisation and more open structures.Coltrane was experimenting with a bunch of approaches around this time, making variety one of this album's strengths. He plays soprano saxophone on the beautiful ballad "Central Park West" (pretty rare for him -- he usually played ballads on the tenor). "Satellite" is a piano-less trio tune. "Night of a Thousand Eyes" and "Liberia" are explosive workouts which already showcase Coltrane's powerful tenor playing and his special relationship with Elvin Jones. "Equinox" has him digging deep, deep into the blues -- some of Coltrane's finest, most powerful blues playing this side of "Chasin' the Trane". Throughout this album, his playing is overflowing with ideas.The Atlantic recordings contain some of John Coltrane's best, most accessible, and most focused music. If you've already heard Giant Steps and My Favorite Things (or if you haven't), don't hesitate to pick up Coltrane's Sound.[This review is based on the Deluxe edition, now out of print. The tracklists are identical.]

There are so many Cannonball quintet/sextet albums out there that each one must have at least a few advocates giving it #1 status. While I'm not quite sure I would call this specific album Cannonball's best, it has a pretty strong case. Overall, I like it better than the more popular Mercy Mercy Mercy or Quintet in San Francisco.While Cannonball's earlier albums were great fun, there was always the sense that his music didn't quite have the depth of that recorded by his former associated, Miles and Coltrane. The addition of Yusef Lateef to the group changed that. Not only was Lateef a superb soloist and composer, but under his influence Cannonball's playing began to grow into new areas. Furthermore, Joe Zawinul's appearance at the piano gave the band a stability for the first time in 2 years; at this point, though, Joe was just another great bebop pianist, not the musical visionary he would become.This set kicks off with Lateef's modal "P. Bouk". In this intense performance, both Cannonball and Yusef's solos show the influence of jazz's early 60s avant-garde. Superb. Jimmy Heath's "Gemini" also evokes Coltrane at times."Work Song" was a staple of Cannonball concerts during this period - there are many different versions, and it's tough to pick a favorite, though most of them easily exceed the somewhat tepid studio debut on Them Dirty Blues. This is a really good version, though."Trouble in Mind" - the idea of a really down-home, gospel-infused blues featuring an oboe solo sounds crazy, but it really works.Out of the 3 albums I've heard by this sextet - Jazz Workshop Revisited and Nippon Soul are the other two - this one is definitely the best. It may not be funky enough for fans of Cannonball's "populist" side, but it is nevertheless first-class no-holds-barred live jazz.

This is a collection of music that makes you go "WOW", nothing more, nothing less. I've heard this referred to as Miles's best fusion band. Now, I don't know about that - you have the "Lost Quintet" with Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette, and also the '73-'75 bands with Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas. Every person will have a different favorite.But regardless, this box is an awesome chunk of music to have, spread out over 6 discs. There's been some argument over whether the band was better or worse with John McLaughlin as a guest (discs 5 and 6). I think both have something to offer. Most of discs 5 and 6 previously appeared, with some editing, on the Live Evil double album. The group without him has not been heard away from bootlegs. So for those who don't collect the latter, this will be the first taste of a loud, extremely funky yet brilliantly improvisational unit.Gary Bartz is one of my favorite electric-Miles saxophonists, after Wayne Shorter. Cannonball and the avant-garde collide! Keith Jarrett is a joy on electric keyboards - funky, yet abstract. Jack D and Michael Henderson really lock into some amazing grooves, and when John McLaughlin appears (shortly before the Mahavishnu Orchestra formed), he fits right in with those two. Miles, well, though I like his later playing, this is one of the last times you get to hear him as a virtuoso player, before drug use and ill health impaired his chops.If you like electric Miles this is a must. Full stop. Enjoy!

This is an interesting compilation of Cannonball Adderley's quintet playing with large ensembles from two different points in his careers.The original LP Domination takes up the first 8 tracks. I picked this album up for the bonus track and was very pleasantly surprised. I associate Oliver Nelson arrangements with watered-down mid-to-late 60s jazz - but this is a no-nonsense modern big band record. Though it has some "populist" touches typical for a Cannonball album, the more overt late 60s rock/funk leanings that repel some and attract others are nowhere to be heard. The compositions are a fairly interesting bunch. I particularly like Nat's "Cyclops", Ray Bryant's "Shake a Lady", and Victor Feldman's "Gon Gong".The final track comes from the album Experience in E, recorded in May 1970. (It's not clear to me why Blue Note refused to include the entire album; there's space on this CD for more music.) By this time Joe Zawinul had already recorded In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew with Miles Davis, but had not yet left to start Weather Report; he and Cannonball each had unique perspectives on the evolving merger between jazz and 60s popular music. The large ensemble that accompanies Cannonball's quintet on this track is not a big band but rather an orchestra; the sonic stew is thus a great example of the "no boundaries" environment of the late 60s. Freebop alternates with free jazz, rock and dissonant orchestral interludes. I can't say the music is an unqualified success, but it is a lot of fun to listen to and never boring. If you're a fan of late 60s jazz, this will be right up your alley.In case you were planning to skip this one - think again.

Acoustic Masters was a "special project" recorded around the same time as Charles Lloyd went into the studio for ECM to record The Call, and not surprisingly, it sounds a lot different. The chamber atmospherics of the ECM album are gone, and instead you have Lloyd collaborating with a swinging hard bop rhythm section. And what a fine one it is - Cedar Walton, Buster Williams, and Billy Higgins. (In fact, the 80s group Eastern Rebellion was pretty much this lineup except with George Coleman on tenor.)If the ECM albums evoke mid-60s John Coltrane, this one makes me think of Giant Steps and Coltrane Jazz. Lloyd brings 4 original compositions (three of which reappeared on later ECM albums), each of his partners contributes a single tune (Walton's "Clandestine" is my favorite), and there's a wonderful take on Thelonious Monk's "Green Chimneys". We get some intense blues blowing over a nice groove during "Blues for Bill".I picked this one up to fill in a gap in my Lloyd collection, but I was very pleasantly surprised - I would put it up there as some of his best work since 1985.

Cannonball Adderley's music had always been "populist", with a strong influence from African-American popular music. In the late 60s, that meant funk, soul and rock influences, to the alarm of some purists.You won't hear much of that here, though. The electric piano is nowhere to be heard. There's one tune here - "Money in the Pocket" - that you could characterize as "mid-60s soul jazz/crossover", and unfortunately it's not a top-tier example (but not bad either). The rest is comfortably in the mainstream of straight-ahead hard-bop and post-bop jazz. "Hear Me Talkin' to Ya" is a classic Cannonball blues from the 50s. "Stardust" gets a beautiful ballad performance. "Introduction to a Samba" is a bossa nova. Not a hint of rock to be heard on those.The two "surprises" are "Requiem for a Jazz Musician", a beautiful enigmatic composition by Joe Zawinul (evocative of Mingus), and an intense, Coltrane-ish take on "Fiddler on the Roof" (much faster than the original studio version). Both showcase the progressive side of Cannonball's music, not afraid of new ideas or challenging his audience.If you're looking for (or afraid of) late 60s "commercial" Cannonball, you won't find it on Money in the Pocket. Instead, you'll hear a no-BS, intense live post-bebop performance by a band that could do this kind of stuff in their sleep. They're not asleep here, though.

Look at the setlist for this 8-CD box, with its mix of standards, ballads and a few originals, and you might mistake it for one of those 50s albums that Miles recorded for Prestige. But the group on these recordings -- Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams -- takes those recordings and turns them inside out. A tune like &quot;I Fall in Love too Easily&quot; will appear several times and on each version, sound completely different. &quot;Stella by Starlight&quot; might begin at a crawl, switch into a waltz on and off, acquire a bluesy or funky groove, and speed up from a snail's crawl to a Formula One pace only to slow down again. The original harmony of the tunes is often disregarded for whatever the soloist wishes to play, and the rhythm section follows right behind him. (Though just as often, it is Hancock &amp; Williams that lead the soloist!) Miles plays a little erratically but Wayne Shorter is incredible; his playing is sometimes soft and melodic, sometimes intense and expressionistic, but always sparse and enigmatic. I find this to be the most difficult of all the official Miles Davis recordings; though it doesn't feature the outright abrasiveness of the electric albums, the abstract, exploratory and skeletal approach to these tunes can be hard to follow without concentration. But once you figure what's going on, there are hours of enjoyment and discovery in these seven sets of live jazz from December 22-23, 1965. This is in the Miles Davis top ten.

Poor Bud Powell was never the same after a racial incident in which policemen violently beat him on the head. A nervous breakdown and electroshock therapy caused a further deterioration. His 50s recordings are a mixed bag, with moments of brilliance shining through the underlying instability. But these recordings, made for Blue Note in 1949 and 1951 before his breakdown, showcase Bud in full command of the music.The 1949 recordings feature an all-star quintet, with youngster Sonny Rollins on tenor sax, the feisty Fats Navarro on trumpet, and Roy Haynes on drums. &quot;Bouncing with Bud&quot;, &quot;Wail&quot;, and &quot;Dance of the Infidels&quot; are all classic Powell themes; he also tackles other bop standards: Dizzy's &quot;You Go to My Head&quot;, Bird's &quot;Ornithology&quot;, and Monk's &quot;52nd Street Theme&quot;. The 1951 recordings are in a trio with Max Roach, and center around two monster recordings: &quot;Parisian Thoroughfare&quot; and the intense Afro-Latin workout &quot;Un Poco Loco&quot;. On both sessions, Powell's trademark turbo-charged piano lines are in full force.This reissue, in the RVG series, provides clearer sound and 5 additional tunes over the previous CD version. Each alternate take is worth hearing. The Amazing Bud Powell Volume One is truly amazing.

John Barleycorn Must Die is a great album and I have a soft spot for Traffic's debut, but as far as I'm concerned they peaked on their self-titled second album. It strips away much of the psychedelia of Heaven Is in Your Mind, leaving a tasty mix of blues-rock, R&amp;B, folk, little bits of classical, and even country -- all focused into short, tight songs. Between five great Dave Mason originals and five classics penned by the rest of the band, there isn't a dud present. Especially noteworthy are the dreamy &quot;40,000 Headmen&quot; (nice flute playing by Chris Wood), the classic rock staple &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot;, and Dave Mason's cheery &quot;You Can All Join In&quot;, and the meaty blues-rock of &quot;Pearly Queen&quot;. If you like late 60s British rock, this album is absolutely essential.

Africa/Brass was Coltrane's first recording for the fledgeling Impulse label, and sets the tone for the rest. The music is beautifully recorded, courtesy of Rudy Van Gelder; while RVG's engineering is not without its flaws, it does justice to Coltrane's music far better than the thin, distant sound of the Atlantic years. There's also a much darker presence to the music, though that may have as much to do with the cover art Impulse usually put on Trane's albums.Stylistically, this album has a lot in common with the final Atlantic album (Ole) as well as the live Village Vanguard recordings. Coltrane was experimenting with large ensembles - in this case, a brass-heavy big band with arrangements from McCoy Tyner and Eric Dolphy. Despite an impressive ensemble, the only soloists here are from Coltrane's quartet - the leader himself, McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman (in conjunction with the second bassist, Art Davis), and Elvin Jones.The meat of this album, as on Ole, comes from the lengthiest track, "Africa". This one is a MONSTER - it's intense, it grooves, it pushes the envelope without scaring off too many listeners. Those whoopings from the brass in the background are just great. The other tracks are nice, but they are anticlimactic once you hear "Africa". Some people complain about the excessive alternate takes, but it is performed differently enough each time to justify having them all.The other tunes are nice, if not on the same level. "Greensleeves" seems to be popular - it's another one of Trane's soprano waltzes, trying to create a hit - but it doesn't come off nearly as well as "My Favorite Things". The other tunes each give a different spin on the brassy big band sound; the tunes not released on the original album are generally on par with those that were.I would generally encourage most people to purchase this 2-disc version instead of the 1-disc recently issued by Impulse. The only people who would probably prefer just one disc are casual fans who will end up with only 4 or 5 Trane discs in their collection.

This is almost a &quot;super-Exit Stage Left&quot; -- the band's most popular tunes, some more recent material, with an additional disc of previously unreleased live material from 1978. The sound here is good though it lacks the sparkling, overly doctored sound of Exit Stage Left. It's nice to have some of the more recent material live (especially &quot;Dreamline&quot;, &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot;, and &quot;Bravado&quot;) and there are also some previously unreleased classics, like the &quot;2112&quot; suite (edited on All the World's a Stage), &quot;Natural Science&quot;, and an amazing &quot;Analog Kid&quot;. The 1978 disc is leagues ahead of All the World's a Stage, with most of the material from A Farewell to Kings performed really well. I'm not sure whether it was necessary to include &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, and other hits on yet another live album, but this is still a great value for 3 CDs. Definitely the band's best release of the 90s and worth buying for Rush fans.

These are some of the earliest recordings of Santana, before they hit it big with their classic debut and the show-stopping performance at Woodstock. The band's Afro-Latin sound hasn't really gelled yet -- Mike Shrieve's absence on drums is obvious, and the lack of the Latin percussionists (just a conga player here) makes the rhythms a little less exciting. Carlos's playing shows signs of his future greatness but on some of the jams he sounds a little tentative. The live versions of tunes that would appear on the debut are much looser and the band really stretches out compared to the studio. &quot;Jingo&quot; and &quot;Treat&quot; are especially nice. I'm not sure I'd say this version of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; is better than the one performed at Woodstock, but it's still interesting. Some of the never previously released tunes are really just jams that sometimes work (&quot;Chunk-a-funk&quot;) and sometimes overstay their welcome (the 30 minute &quot;Freeway Jam&quot;). There's also a smoldering version of Albert King's &quot;As the Years Go Passing By&quot; and a groovy cover of Chico Hamilton's &quot;Conquistadore Rides Again&quot;. All in all, these live recordings find Santana halfway between the 60s San Francisco sound of long, drug-soaked jams and their trademark Latin Rock. These performances must have made some very stoned kids very happy back in '68. It's not perfect, but it's fun to listen to!

This is the first of three albums by the classic Santana lineup: Carlos Santana on guitar, Gregg Rolie on keyboards and vocals, Dave Brown on bass, Mike Shrieve on drums, and Jose Areas and Mike Carabello on percussion. The band shows a great improvement over the 1968 recordings at the Fillmore -- Carlos's playing is much more confident and inventive, the addition of Mike Shrieve loosens up the drumming, and Areas and Carabello bring out the Afro-Latin aspects of the music. At the same time, the band's sound is still strongly rooted in the blues (especially on &quot;You Just Don't Care&quot;) and wouldn't fully achieve its potential until 1970's Abraxas. Nevertheless, many of the performances are absolute classics -- especially the fiery organ-guitar duel on &quot;Waiting&quot; and the explosive &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot;. Those familiar with Santana's radio hits will of course recognize &quot;Evil Ways&quot; and their chugging version of Olatunji's &quot;Jingo&quot;, while the laid-back Latin groove of &quot;Treat&quot; provides a nice respite. And the bonus tracks, from the band's Woodstock performance, make this album even more essential: you get to hear exactly why the live performance of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; blew away so many acid-drenched listeners at the festival. It's still speaker-frying 32 years later. If you like the stinging guitar and swirling organ of early Santana, their debut is a must-buy.

This is the third and last album featuring the classic Santana lineup of Carlos, Gregg Rolie, Mike Shriever, Dave Brown, Mike Carabello, and Chepito Areas; two new members join the mix: guitarist Neil Schon and percussionist Coke Escovedo. Schon's contributions are mixed -- he really pushes Carlos, but his over-the-top pyrotechnic rock playing often destroys the subtlety of the music; Carlos is overly generous with the playing space. Though the music is still in classic Santana territory, the band's sound is substantially heavier (primarily due to Schon's presence) and more experimental. In particular, there are more sprawling jazz-rock jams: &quot;Batuka&quot;, the classic epic &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot;, and an intense cover of Gene Ammons's &quot;Jungle Strut&quot;. (Schon, Santana and Rolie engage trade fours in a pretty dramatic fashion on this one.) There is another great Tito Puente cover (a frantic &quot;Para Los Rumberos&quot;) and they venture deep into Cuban territory with the fantastic &quot;Guajira&quot; (nice piano by Mario Ochoa).Some of Santana's weaknesses also come to the fore; these guys were never the best songwriters. &quot;Taboo&quot; really drags, &quot;Everything's Coming Our Way&quot; is pleasant filler, and &quot;No One to Depend On&quot; is a decent attempt to replicate the success of &quot;Evil Ways&quot; and &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;. &quot;Everybody's Everything&quot;, with a great funk gallop and the Tower of Power horn section, is much better.This album is halfway between Santana's classic Latin rock sound and the mid-70s jazz rock experiments; it isn't quite at the same level as either Abraxas or Caravanserai, but a great album nonetheless.

This album fits comfortably into Santana's steady deterioration during the second half of the 1970s. Not everything here sucks, but most of it is fairly bland late 70s rock and R&B.; The best stuff on here is probably the two Steve Winwood-related covers -- "The Dealer" and "Well All Right". (Vocalist Greg Walker sounds quite a bit like Winwood on much of the album.) These aren't great, but they aren't bad.The only tune that deserves special comment is "Open Invitation": this song is hilariously awful, the kind of radio-friendly pop-metal that people routinely laugh at. I think it's worth hearing Inner Secrets just for this track.Unless you're a Santana completist or a fan of mediocre late 70s music, I wouldn't bother with this one. The best thing that can be said about it is that some of the later Santana albums would be even worse.[Note: I am basing this review on the 1990 edition, which has an identical tracklist and presumably similar sound quality.]

The best thing that can be said about it is that some of the later Santana albums would be even worse.

This album has one of the most misleading titles in jazz history. By the time it was released in 1966, the music must have sounded quaintly conservative - jazz's avant-garde moved far, far beyond the 5 tunes on this recording. John Coltrane was recording challenging albums like Meditations and Live at the Village Vanguard Again while Don Cherry's collaborations with Albert Ayler and Pharoah Sanders were also stretching listeners' ears. The 3 Ornette Coleman compositions are from 1958-59, adventurous but with still-obvious bebop roots.This album is probably one of the weakest albums Coltrane recorded under his own name, and definitely my least favorite from the Atlantic years. It's obviously of historic interest - the only time Coltrane ever recorded Ornette Coleman's music, and the first official recording of him with soprano sax. Coltrane actually took lessons from Ornette, but their musical approaches were quite different and it makes Coltrane sound a little like a fish out of water. That great groove he had with McCoy and Elvin (or prior, with his companions from Miles Davis's band) never locks in here, largely because Charlie Haden and Ed Blackwell didn't do that kind of thing. That's not a diss against Haden and Blackwell - both play GREAT here. Percy Heath offers a more conservative spin when he subs for Haden, but he knew how to play this music and fits in quite well. Don Cherry is also very good - we get what I think is his first recorded composition, "Cherryco" - though I think you'd have to wait until the mid-60s to really get a sense of what he was capable of as a bandleader (rather than Ornette sidekick).Overall, I'd put this pretty low on the list of "Coltrane to get" - I'd pick up most of the classic Impulse, Atlantic, Prestige and Blue Note recordings before venturing here. I'd also put this fairly low on the list for Cherry or Coleman fans. But very few fans of those musicians would hear this album and not enjoy it.

The two Cannonball gigs on this CD were part of a series of radio broadcasts from the Half Note club in NYC during the mid-60s. Cannonball's playing, and that of his group, was constantly improving during this period, and on balance this is better music than the more popular records of the late 50s and early 60s.The first four tracks come from what I am guessing is the chronologically later gig - 1965 or 1966 - since the group is a quintet (Charles Lloyd had left by this time). Cannonball's playing was showing a strong avant-garde influence by this time and you can hear it on "Fiddler on the Roof" (much faster and more intense than the studio version) and "The Little Boy With Sad Eyes" (his entrance reminds me of Dolphy). "Stars Fell on Alabama" is a lovely ballad performance.The next three tracks feature the sextet with Charles Lloyd. Unfortunately, the live album this group recorded for Capitol is currently out of print, so this is the only widely available document of their stage performances. (There are also circulating tapes from other Half Note broadcasts.) Every live version of "Work Song" I've heard is great, and this one is highlighted by Lloyd's smoking tenor solo over the charging rhythm. "The Song My Lady Sings" is such a beautiful Lloyd composition; it's a shame only a few have recorded it.The sound here isn't as pristine as on the "official" Cannonball recordings, but is generally adequate; the only problem is on the sextet tracks, where there are serious issues with one of the stereo channels. I am not sure whether this is a problem with the original tapes or just the current reissue.Recommended.

I haven't read every Miles Davis bio - in particular, John Szwed's more recent book has gotten good reviews and therefore may end up replacing this one as a standard, comprehensive reference."Comprehensive" is probably this book's biggest asset - it tries to cover every item that Davis recorded (and released) before the mid-1980s. Written by a non-musician, it is accessible to laymen.Unfortunately, there are significant shortcomings. Probably foremost is the author's bias against Davis's music from 1965 onward. Reading his commentary on the 2nd quintet and electric eras, you get the feeling that he doesn't "get" the music and is incapable of discussing it in an insightful manner. This is not the place to go for a substantive discussion of Sorcerer, B's Brew or Agharta. These shortcomings also come through in his commentary of the cultural context for post-1965 recordings.There are also numerous errors in the discographical sections. Some of this couldn't have been avoided (when Chambers wrote the book, he didn't have the extensive online sessionographies we have today). Other mistakes are fairly obvious to serious listeners, and make me wonder whether Chambers actually listened to the recordings he reviews. Either way, for this information you're better off using another source.Finally, Chambers uses no primary sources. This is a real shame as he wrote the book when Miles and a larger number of his sidemen were alive. His secondary sources are fairly wide-ranging, but surely we could have gotten more insight from the musicians themselves.One aspect that was not a shortcoming to me, but may be more problematic to others, is the relatively cursory discussion of Davis's personal life. It's discussed when necessary, but Chambers is much more interested in the music than the man.When I picked up this book, I had maybe 15-20 Miles Davis albums and this volume piqued my interest enough to pick up many more. In particular, his discussion of the Christmas Eve 1954 prompted me to run out and get "Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants". So if that's where you're at, go ahead and pick up this book. If, instead, you're interested, you're interested in picking a thoughtful, thorough and accurate discussion of Davis's music, you're better off going elsewhere.

This album is an intriguing and informal meeting between two masterful fusion guitarists. Unfortunately the result isn't especially masterful -- some of the compositions are just vehicles for fast and ultimately meaningless guitar duels. But the lengthy (and lengthy-titled) &quot;Let Us Go House into the House of the Lord&quot;, something clicks. Over a nice groove that's greatly enhanced by Larry Young's organ doodles and Armando Peraza's bongos, McLaughlin and Santana stretch out and produce genuinely ecstatic music. The other two electric tracks (&quot;The Life Divine&quot; and John Coltrane's &quot;Acknowledgment&quot;), on the other hand, aren't much more than speed exercises over functional grooves. The acoustic tracks are nice but I can take them or leave them. Overall this isn't either guitarist's best work in the jazz-rock arena -- check out the Inner Mounting Flame or Caravanserai to see them at their best. But it's nice to hear them play in an unfamiliar setting (neither the Latinisms of Santana nor the bulldozer intensity of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) and on about half of the album it works. And be sure to check out some of Larry Young's albums from the 60s -- Unity or Into' Somethin -- to see what this giant of the B3 organ was truly capable of. John McLaughlin or Santana completists should pick it up.

Jazz ideas had already been creeping into Santana's music on tracks like "Incident at Neshabur" and "Toussaint L'Overture", but Caravanserai boldly moved deep into jazz-rock territory. The upbeat and catchy Latin rock of the band's first 3 albums was replaced by a more meditative, abstract and instrumentally-focused style influenced by Miles Davis's early electric bands and Chick Corea's Return to Forever.Most of the band's original members are still here (Gregg Rolie, Mike Shrieve, Chepito Areas) but their roles have changed dramatically. Mike Shrieve suddenly steps up in the compositional department and his drumming really improves. Check out his Elvin Jones-isms on "Waves Within". Gregg Rolie sticks to keyboards (lots of electric piano) and the remaining vocals are pleasantly inconsequential. Guests make a big difference -- Tom Rutley's acoustic bass is a nice touch on many of the tunes, and future keyboardist Tom Coster makes his first appearance on a Santana album. Carlos and Neil Schon play off each other really well. The tunes range all over the map, from the epic "Every Step of the Way" (the guitar riff that ends the intro is awesome) to serious funk ("Look Up") to percussion duets ("Future Primitive").The influence of Latin music is still here in a big way with the gentle Jobim cover "Stone Flower" and the grooving instrumental "La Fuente del Ritmo", but people expecting the Classic Santana will be disappointed. Nevertheless this is one of Santana's best albums, right up there with Abraxas; whereas their later jazz-rock efforts were often mixed bags, it works here in a big way.[This review is based on the original CD version, which has an identical tracklist; I would assume the 2003 reissue has better sound.]

This album starts out fantastically -- "Dreamline" is easily one of the best songs the band has ever done, while "Bravado" and the title track maintain a high standard. But other than "Heresy" and the instrumental "Where's My Thing", the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock. Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the (near) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring. The completist will want to pick this up, but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages.[This review is based on the original 1991 release, not the 2004 remaster; the sound quality on the original is just fine.]

This was the last of four albums recorded by the Miles Davis Quintet for Prestige records in 1956. (Cookin', Relaxin', and Workin' are the others.) My feeling is that the music, while generally strong, is what you'd expect from the last material to be released -- the music on the other albums (particularly Cookin' and Relaxin') is mostly better than what you'll find on this album.The highlight, and without a doubt one of the best recordings from the 1956 Prestige sessions, is &quot;The Surrey with the Fringe on Top&quot;. The rhythm section sets up their perfect light swinging groove, over which Miles's weaves a witty, melodic trumpet solo. Coltrane follows, barrelling ahead and providing the perfect constrast. &quot;Diane&quot; mines a similar groove though not quite reaching the same heights. The two ballads (&quot;Something I Dreamed Last Night&quot; and &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;) are typical for Miles during this time, with Coltrane sitting out; I think they are pretty colorless in comparison to &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; (Cookin') and &quot;It Never Entered My Mind&quot; (Workin'). The same could be said for the bebop tunes -- not really on the caliber of &quot;Airegin&quot;, &quot;Oleo&quot; or &quot;Tune Up&quot;. Most of the music comes from the May session, not from the October session, so Coltrane's playing is more erratic than on Cookin' and Relaxin'.I would get the other 3 albums from these sessions first, but this was a good enough group that almost everything by them is worth hearing. Steamin' is a very enjoyable listen.

The second of Lloyd's ECM albums, this one brings back Bobo Stenson but swaps out Palle Danielsson and Jon Christensen for Anders Jormin and Ralph Peterson, Jr. It's one of the strongest of Lloyd's ECM albums, and despite sticking to mostly slow tempos, holds your attention throughout.The album opens on a meditative note with the beautiful ballad "Requiem" (revisited on Voice in the Night and the Athens Concert). Then, that meditation over, the group launches into... another ballad! A lot of the album showcases Lloyd at his most Coltraneish - both "Pilgrimages", "Takur", and "When Miss Jessye Sings". The music is reminiscent of Crescent, A Love Supreme and Quartet Plays without being derivative.Of the five albums Lloyd recorded with Stenson, I'd put this one in second place after Canto, in a tie with the much feistier All My Relations. Check it out!

Belonging was the first album Keith Jarrett recorded with what was (sort of) ECM's house band - Jan Garbarek, Palle Danielsson, and Jon Christensen. The three Scandinavians already had experience playing together (check out the classic Witchi Tai To, with Bobo Stenson on piano), while Keith Jarrett had been leading a wonderful group with Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian.This album sits somewhere between those two sound universes. It was made just two months after Jarrett and his American group went into the studio to record Treasure Island, and six months before they created the great albums Backhand and Death and the Flower. The material on Belonging has a lot of affinity with those three albums. "Solstice", the intense free jazz ballad that closes the album (and reminds us of Garbarek's Albert Ayler roots), has more in common with "Vapallia" or "Rose Petals" than with sweeter musings like "Country", "My Song", or "Innocence". And the faster tunes sound similar to those Keith was doing with the Americans around the same time. (Compare "The Windup" to "Inflight".) The Europeans covered the same terrain, roughly, as the Americans.Still, there are differences. On the American group albums, Haden and Motian were stubborn iconoclasts that, in any context, would do things THEIR WAY. Christensen and Danielsson had their own personalities, but at least at this juncture were willing to be more cooperative/compliant with Keith's vision. And of course Garbarek had a very different, lighter tone than Redman.If I have to make a (terrible?) analogy, the American group was like a really hearty steak or robust porter, while the European unit was an extremely fresh salad or crisp pilsner. Both prepared by the same chef or brewer, of course. And both are delicious and nutritious parts of a musical diet.

Fish Out of Water was Lloyd's 2nd "comeback", following shortly on the heels of the first one (when Michel Petrucciani coaxed him out of semi-retirement), and kicked off a long string of albums on ECM (at this point, I think there have been around 20 discs).It's easy to come up with reasons to be enthusiastic about this album. Lloyd plays vigorously and effortlessly, avoiding the out-of-focus weakness that appeared on some of those famous 60s albums. He's joined by the same rhythm section that backed Jan Garbarek on Witchi-Tai-To and Dansere - Bobo Stenson, Palle Daniellson and Jon Christensen. They offer a wonderfully loose backing. The album starts off strongly with the upbeat title track, then veers into exoticism of the best type with "Hagia Sophia" (Lloyd starts out with some breathy alto flute hear, then returns to tenor). "The Dirge" is a Coltraneish minor blues that also appears on the live album Rabo De Nube (under the title "Migration of the Spirit") while "Bharati" is a beautiful quasi-ballad that would get revisited on Hyperion with Higgins (I think this version is better, but both are great).My only beef, a small one, is that the music tends to blur together at times, particularly toward the end of the album. Nothing wrong with the uptempo "Eyes of Love" and "Mirror" (a beautiful ballad), but they don't add that much to what came before. "Tellaro" is a bonus CD-only track and, while nice, isn't on the level of the original album.Still, these are all minor complaints. Anybody who likes Lloyd's other ECM albums, and more generally music that lies somewhere in the intersection of post-Coltrane jazz and post-Bill-Evans jazz, should enjoy it.

This was one of the first CDs I ever spoke, and as a teenager its anger and bitterness really spoke to me. Now, looking back 15 years later, the music just doesn't resonate and some of it actually makes me cringe. That's not to say you shouldn't pick it up - lots of people genuinely love this album - but that you should know what you are getting into.In the case of The Wall, the tunes played on the radio are a fairly good representation of the album's best work. "Comfortably Numb", "Run Like Hell", "Hey You", "Run Like Hell" and "The Happiest Days/Another Brick #2" are all enjoyable, if (to many radio listeners) played so frequently that they offer few surprises at this point. There are a few gems hidden elsewhere - "Mother" may be the best song on the album, and "Nobody Home" is a very poignant Waters + piano + orchestra ballad. "Goodbye Blue Sky" and the acoustic guitar sequence on "Is There Anybody Out There" are worth mentioning as well.And then there are sides 2 and 4 of the original double album. The album's key weakness is an excessive focus on lyrics over the music, and the second half of each CD really showcase this problem. The sequences from "Empty Spaces" to "Goodbye Cruel World" and "Waiting for the Worms" to "Outside the Wall" are, at best, boring and occasionally unlistenable. There's a common argument from Waters critics that the songs cowritten with Gilmour are the best on the album, but that conveniently ignores the lame "Young Lust". And "The Trial" - yikes - awful, awful, awful, even worse than "The Dogs of War".The Wall remains enormously popular with many listeners - I think it is still Floyd's best seller after Dark Side of the Moon - and most people will enjoy it. But it is flawed, and for those who prefer Pink Floyd's "head music" through 1975, a likely disappointment.

This CD, long out of print, is among the best avant-garde CDs put out by Blue Note records in the mid-60s -- right up there with Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch and Andrew Hill's Point of Departure. All 3 albums have the same exploratory, progressive attitude without forsaking swing or the blues. Things kick off with the demented mambo "Catta". Composer Andrew Hill splashes dissonant piano chords over the dance rhythms, Sam Rivers blows fiery lines on the tenor sax, Freddie Hubbard shows off his avant-garde trumpet credentials, and then Bobby Hutcherson provides his spacy, cerebral vibraphone musings. Hill gets the same twisted, off-kilter feel on the blues "Ghetto Lights". "Idle While" is an eerie Joe Chambers ballad. The two collective improvisations "Les Noirs Marchent" (set to a marching rhythm) and "Dialogue" are among the finest of their kind -- instead of getting into a blowing cacophony, all six musicians listen carefully to each other and the music has a natural ebb and flow. Bassist Richard Davis's playing holds the enterprise together, stretching and contracting as the music demand.Dialogue is an essential listen for most fans of adventurous 60s jazz. If you like Dialogue, there are other Blue Note albums that should tickle your fancy: Out to Lunch (with Hutcherson, Davis, and Hubbard), Point of Departure (with Hill and Davis), Jackie McLean's Let Freedom Ring, and Tony Williams's Life Time (with Rivers, Davis and Hutcherson). Be sure to pick up Hutcherson's Components (with Chambers and Hubbard) and Stick-Up as well.

Thelonious Monk could really shine in the trio setting, where his unflagging creativity and memorable tunes could occupy the spotlight. These ten selections from '52 to '54 showcase that side of Monk wonderfully; and almost all of them are brief (less than 4 minutes), providing bite-sized intros to a nice chunk of his material. As a bonus, the drummers (Art Blakey or Max Roach) understand Monk's conception perfectly. Three of the tunes feature Monk's idiosyncratic playing on standards ("Sweet and Lovely", "These Foolish Songs", and the solo feature "Just a Gigolo"). The other seven are recording debuts of songs that would become jazz standards -- "Monk's Dream", "Little Rootie Tootie", "Trinkle Tinkle", etc. And the definite highlight is "Blue Monk", Monk's unforgettable blues (duh), where he gets to stretch out over 8 minutes with Blakey egging him on. Monk is often described as a "difficult" pianist due to his angular playing, but listeners often identify with his quirky-yet-catchy tunes and wry sense of humor. This (along with Volumes 1 and 2 of the Genius of Modern Music series on Blue Note) is the perfect introduction to the man and his music, as well as to jazz piano in general.[This review is based on the K2 20-bit remaster, which has fantastic sound. I have not heard the 2007 reissue. Both have identical tracklists.]

This album, recorded in October 1951, features some young musicians who made their names after Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie burst on the scene. These youngsters -- trumpeter Miles Davis, tenorist Sonny Rollins, and teenage altoist Jackie McLean -- would figure prominently in 50s bebop. Drummer Art Blakey was a bit older, but would leave his mark on jazz by leading some stellar hard bop bands in the next decade.Charlie Parker's shadow looms over this record. He was actually present at the recording. Both Davis and pianist Walter Bishop had played with Parker; McLean was, at this point in his career, a devout ornithologist; and Rollins would pick up the saxophone crown after Bird's death.The music is nice but doesn't present anything earthshattering. (I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars.) There are some good tunes and the musicians get to stretch out. On the other hand, the horn players are a bit sloppy and the sound sucks.This isn't an essential recording. Few of the recordings Miles Davis made in the early 50s during his heroin addiction are classics. But if you have a substantial Davis collection this will fill in a gap. It also gives a portrait of two not-quite-fully-formed future stars (Jackie McLean and Sonny Rollins) as well as jazz in transition from bebop to the 50s hard bop style. You probably won't be disappointed if you pick it up.

1957 was the watershed year for John Coltrane -- on earlier recordings with Miles Davis and others, he occasionally sounded tentative or overambitious. But by the time he went into the studio in February '58 to record Soultrane, he had made the transition from being just another hard bop saxophonist to becoming one of the most revolutionary musicians in jazz. He sounds confident and full of fresh ideas on each of the five selections here, his playing has increased in density (&quot;sheets of sound&quot;), and his rhythm section (Red Garland, Paul Chambers, Art Taylor) always swings. The quartet takes Tadd Dameron's &quot;Good Bait&quot; at a bouncy, mid-tempo pace. Coltrane's first recording of Bill Eckstine's &quot;I Want to Talk About You&quot; is also on the record; it's beautiful and respectful but lacks the passionate intensity of later live versions. The album closes out with a moving elegy to alto saxophonist Ernie Henry (&quot;Theme for Ernie&quot;) and a torrential version of Irving Berlin's &quot;Russian Lullaby&quot;. This isn't a masterpiece on the level of Blue Train, but it is one of Coltrane's best recordings on the Prestige label and features him at the beginning of his &quot;sheets of sound&quot; period. It also provides a nice complement to the classic Milestones album which he recorded at about the same time with the Miles Davis sextet.

In the hit-and-miss world of early 70s King Crimson, Lizard is a hit; unlike the unoriginal Poseidon and the pedestrian Islands, it's a surprisingly strong record by a band that never really managed to get its act together until 1973. Gordon Haskell's unconventional vocals are usually a prime target for ridicule, but they fit this album reall well. Haskell sounds much better than Boz Burrell and even Greg Lake's prog melodramatics grow old after a while. The cool thing about Lizard is that it's so damn strange -- there's no other King Crimson album that even tries to match its mutant mix of jazz, rock, and classical. The band even tries to tackle the super-cliche of progressive rock, a 20 minute epic suite with Jon Anderson of Yes on vocals, and manages to turn the cliches inside out. How many other prog epics have a Bolero section with dissonant multi-horn improvisation? Side one has four shorter pieces. "Happy Family" gets slammed a lot, but Gordon Haskell's manic, processed vocals, Pete Sinfield's obscure lyrics and the schizophrenic free jazz blowing make a great combination. One of Crimson's best tunes ever. Add that to "Cirkus", "Lady of the Dancing Water" (some beautiful flute on that one), and the Anglo-funk from Pluto of "Indoor Games", and you've got a great batch of music.

This 3 CD box set covers recordings from September 1968 to February 1969; as such it covers a lot more than the actual In a Silent Way sessions, but nevertheless illustrates how Miles and his cohorts moved from the spontaneous abstraction of the Second Great Quintet to an ethereal sound that merged jazz, rock, and R&B.; If you want to hear this transition, pick up the box; if you don't feel the need, all you really need is the eventual remaster of the original album. So it's for hardcore Davis fans only, but those fans will be very pleased.Disc 1 opens with the first session to include bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea. The languid, bluesy "Mademoiselle Mabry" and the furious boogaloo "Frelon Brun" are essential tracks from the classic album Filles de Kilimanjaro, and should really be heard in that context rather than just this box. Of the next four tracks, "Two Faced" is a lengthy post-bop exploration while the last 3 tracks are somewhat cheesy boogaloos (especially "Dual Mr. Anthony...") salvaged by genius of the musicians. The last track, "Splashdown", has never been previously released.Disc 2 is where the music really starts to move to new territory. Joe Zawinul's composition "Ascent" is a beautiful though slightly unfocused tone poem, a clear predecessor of "In a Silent Way" and "Orange Lady". If you like the shimmering keyboard trio sound of In a Silent Way, you'll love this. On the other hand both takes of "Directions" fuse jazz improvisation with a pounding rock backbeat; though live performances of this tune are more intense, this version definitely has its charms.Disc 2 continues with the actual In a Silent Way sessions and the first appearance of guitar virtuoso John McLaughlin: an amusing though inessential bossa nova version of Zawinul's "In a Silent Way"; the take of "In a Silent Way" that eventually appeared on the album; and Teo's original mixes for "It's About That Time" and "Shhh/Peaceful". The latter is a real surprise and gem -- it was originally a harder-hitting piece and Tony Williams played more than just the hi-hat!It's disc 3, though, that makes this package worth it: first, two previously unissued tracks with the In a Silent Way lineup plus Joe Chambers on drums. "The Ghetto Walk" is a grooving, bluesy piece not unlike the Bitches Brew material, while "Early Minor" is a gorgeous ballad in the Silent Way mold. And then the original In a Silent Way album. If you haven't heard the delicate beauty of this album, you are really missing one of jazz's masterpieces.Enough of this material is unavailable on individual discs to justify picking up the box for a Davis fan who enjoys the other music.

This is one of the more unremarkable and bland Cannonball albums I've heard. It was his first recording with Victor Feldman, who would briefly take over the group's piano seat until Joe Zawinul's arrival, and also features one of only two recorded appearances Cannonball made with the legendary guitarist Wes Montgomery.The music itself is fairly standard late 50s/early 60s Cannonball. There aren't a lot of recordings of Cannonball playing Bird during the 60s, so this version of "Au Privave" is somewhat noteworthy. Feldman's "Azule Serape" gets a better read on the Live at the Lighthouse LP from later in 1960. The highlight of the album is the closer, a very nice +8 minute, briskly swinging "Never Will I Marry".Those who are less lukewarm on Wes Montgomery than me will probably have a greater appreciation for this album, but there are at least three or four other Cannonball albums from the 1959-1960 period that I would recommend first.

Season 5 is a weird one. It features some of the very best episodes in the series' entire run, but also quite a few really weak ones. That's in contrast to the 3rd and 4th seasons, which weren't uniformly brilliant but had a fairly strong sense of quality control.As far as the classics - "Inner Light" obviously tops the list as probably the best in the series' entire run, but it's closely followed by "Darmok", "I, Borg", "The Perfect Mate", "The First Duty", "Cause and Effect", and "Conundrum".The clunkers list is unfortunately just as long, headlined by "Imaginary Friend" and "New Ground". There are at least half a dozen episodes that are comfortably skippable on repeat viewings. Not sure whether the writers got lazy, were pressed for time, or simply ran out of ideas.Nevertheless, this package is worth getting for the great ones.

Song for My Father usually gets the nod as Horace Silver's best album in the post-Jazz Messenger days, but for my money there's simply no competition. Blowin' the Blues Away lines up song after song of punchy, upbeat hard bop, with melodies that will stay stuck in your head for days on end and grooves that run three feet into the floor. The feisty front line of Junior Cook and Blue Mitchell are at their most inspired, and every tune is chock-full of Horace's funky, soulful piano playing. Just give &quot;Sister Sadie&quot; a spin and you'll know what I mean.

Dream Weaver was the debut recording of the classic Charles Lloyd quartet, a group that made some nice albums and achieved major crossover success in the late 60s but today is remembered primarily for launching the careers of Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette. Dream Weaver reminds us that while all four musicians (the great Cecil Mcbee rounds out the group on bass) had great things ahead of them in 1966, they were perfectly capable of making excellent music even back then.Dream Weaver draws comfortably from the entire spectrum of jazz in 1966 -- post-bebop, free jazz, soul jazz, and even some nascent jazz-rock. The quartet swings like crazy on "Autumn Leaves", which Lloyd bookends with two impressionistic collective improvisations. Lloyd's solo on "Leaves" reminds us what a great flute player he is, DeJohnette's brushwork is impeccable, and Jarrett's solo is one of his finest from the period. The title track opens with the Coltraneish "Meditation" before locking into a chunky groove on "Dervish Dance". "Bird Flight", a fast-paced post-bop tune, showcases Lloyd's fondness for intense tenor-drum duets as well as some ripping avant-garde playing by Jarrett. "Love Ship" is a ballad and "Sombrero Sam" rides a funky, dancing boogaloo groove.I haven't heard all of this group's albums, but I'd put this one ahead of Soundtrack, Love-In and even the enormously popular Forest Flower. Lloyd's playing, which is occasionally erratic on the quartet's albums, is quite strong and fiery here. He also plays a lot of flute. Those used to the more laid-back, introspective ECM albums Lloyd has recorded since the late 80s might be pleasantly surprised.

The Charles Lloyd quartet was the first jazz group to play at the Fillmore in San Francisco. This album is from that venue, early in 1967, and reflects some of that hippie vibe. It's one of the group's more listener-friendly, accessible albums but also suffers from some lightweight filler.The meat of the album lies in the longer pieces. The Coltrane-ish "Tribal Dance" gets a better performance than on the Soviet Union album recorded a few months later. "Island Blues" opens with a long, powerful unaccompanied intro by Lloyd (that's the "Memphis Dues Again" part) before breaking into an uptempo romp. "Sunday Morning" is a nice piano trio performance with that classic late 60s Jarrett gospel feeling.The rest of the album isn't quite up to the level of these pieces with some lighter material; on the Beatles cover ("Here There and Everywhere), it even hints at smooth jazz. (Though Jarrett's solo on this tune is outstanding.) Nevertheless, like almost all of this group's music, Love In is definitely worth hearing.

Out of the 1st four Tortoise albums, I think this is the best. The first two Tortoise albums stood out for their extremely sparse and dry sound but on TNT, the production is much lusher and the group fills up a lot more of the sonic space. New elements like IDM and lounge music mix with the traditional Tortoise trademarks (twangy guitars, cinematic grandeur, chugging rhythms, chiming tuned percussion). The album is all over the map stylistically but manages to weave a coherent tapestry of sound. Definitely a fun album to listen to whether you are studying, driving, or simply watching the old lava lamp.[This review is based on the 1998 CD; I have not heard the latest reissue.]

As the other reviewers have noted, this CD (a budget reissue of previously bootlegged material) has an incorrect track listing. "Brazilia" is actually a duplicate, identical performance minus 30 seconds, of "Song of Praise". "One up, One Down" is cut off at the end. The sound quality is also somewhat lacking, at least compared to most of the officially released live Coltrane from the '60s. Is this set still worth buying? The answer is definitely yes, if you're a serious Coltrane fan; at only (low price), 37 minutes (plus 19 duplicated) of quality live Coltrane is a bargain. "I Want to Talk About You" is excellent even if it has a few flubs at the beginning and doesn't quite match the officially released Live at Birdland version. The 20 minute long "Song of Praise" showcases Coltrane's fierce, expressionistic '65 playing and justifies the purchase of this set. It may be worth searching for a better release of this material, but if you can't wait or are on a tight budget (low price!!!) then you should buy this.

After his supposed &quot;comeback&quot; at the 1955 Newport Festival, Miles Davis realized it was finally time to form a working band. The group that he formed, one of the most important jazz units of the 1950s, is the &quot;New Miles Davis Quintet&quot; of the album title. And though the group had already made a session for Columbia a few weeks earlier, this album (recorded in November '55) was the first taste many fans had of Davis's new group.The result was pretty unremarkable, particularly when you consider the five albums the quintet would record for Prestige and Columbia the following year. Tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, who until this point was almost completely unknown, has some interesting ideas but sounds tentative. The rhythm section (Red Garland, Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones) swings but isn't quite as tight as on later recordings. Miles's playing, on both open and mute trumpet, is on par with what you'd expect at this point in his career. The song selection involves a couple of standards and one bebop classic (Benny Golson's &quot;Stablemates&quot;). For what it's worth, the four performances recorded for Columbia (now available on the remaster of Round About Midnight) a few weeks earlier are much better.Coltrane and Miles completists will want this album for sure. Others will find plenty to listen to by both of these giants before picking it up. In summary: nothing bad, nothing special.

I was rounding out holes in my Miles-on-Prestige collection when I realized I had been completely unaware of this album's existence. It's one of his last 50s dates with a "all star" pickup group - within a few weeks, he'd put together the classic quintet with John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones, and as they say "the rest is history."This is also the recording that got Jackie McLean's career going. Jackie had already recorded with Miles a few times in 1951 and 1952, but this was his first session in over three years and he'd be recording pretty regularly after this. It's a shame he appears on only half of the tracks, but Miles must have thought highly of his compositions because two of them are included here - "Minor March" (which Jackie later recorded as "Minor Apprehension" on the album New Soil) and "Dr. Jackle" (which Miles recorded on Milestones with Cannonball Adderley and John Coltrane).The other frontliner is Milt Jackson, who plays well throughout. The rhythm section is Ray Bryant, Percy Heath, and Art Taylor. In other words, a blue-chip 1950s jam session lineup.Overall, I wouldn't put this in the same tier as the best recordings Miles made in 1956 with his classic quintet (or for that matter, the Christmas Eve 1954 session with Jackson, Heath and Thelonious Monk). But it is a nice one, and I don't think anyone would regret picking it up.

Professor Michael Walzer examines just war theory in a clear, methodical and rigorous fashion. Concrete examples clarify and flesh out the theory. It covers not just conventional warfare, but also several offshoots that have become much more relevant since the 1950: peacetime reprisals, guerrilla warfare, and terrorism. In addition, he dissects the notions of &quot;war crimes&quot; and official/bureaucrat/citizen responsibility for war. These analyses are especially useful as today's violent conflicts become more fragmented and in some ways &quot;messier&quot;. Walzer's viewpoint is definitely from a left-of-center perspective (not *far* left), but I think people of any political persuasion would find reading it to be extremely insightful. He doesn't shy away from controversy yet his arguments are always well-reasoned. Highly recommended to both the layman and political scientist/philosopher, especially as we enter the uncertainty of the post-9/11 world.

Like Never Let Me Go, which was recorded about a year earlier, this is a collaboration with Stan's then-wife, organist, Shirley Scott. And like the earlier album, it opens with Lloyd Price's "Trouble". Right off the bat, you get the feeling that this album will sound totally different from its predecessor. For one, it doesn't have that late-night feel - this is more like the album you'd put on at a jazz party, or maybe while driving. The rhythm section here is obviously heavier - to my ears that's a plus. Otis Finch is a chunky drummer, and Bob Cranshaw was great pretty much anywhere.The real magic ingredient, though, is guitarist Kenny Burrell. It's hard for me to think of any guitarist I'd rather hear with a 60s organ ensemble. He's smooth and sophisticated, gritty and earthy, all at the same time. Stan's playing is wonderfully soulful.I wouldn't quite put this in the 1st tier of Stan albums, though maybe over time my assessment it will improve. I certainly prefer it to Never Let Me Go.

Andrew Hill's leader debut for Blue Note is one of his best recordings. The story is that Hill played piano on Joe Henderson's excellent album Our Thing and was then approached by producer Alfred Lion to make an album of his own music. Hill rose to the challenge, bringing seven strikingly original compositions that didn't fit into either the "free jazz" or "hard bop" categories.It wasn't unusual in the mid-60s for Blue Note albums to include original compositions, but sometimes these compositions were pretty generic: a modal number, a "Sidewinder" clone, a blues number, etc. But not here -- each of Hill's tunes is distinct from those generic categories, and from the other tunes on the album. Hill's tunes include weird twists and turns, starts and stops, alternating sections with clashing ideas or moods, unpredictable rhythms, and of course a touch of Monk. "Subterfuge" is a percussive, claustrophobic piano trio performance. "McNeil Island" is another trio performance, but this time Roy Haynes sits out. Joe Henderson plays very lyrically on this one. "Black Fire" is a waltz, alternating an upbeat theme with a darker one. It's interesting to see how the soloists adjust to the frequently adjusting moods in their solos. "Pumpkin" (introduced by a striking Richard Davis bassline) and the sorta-Latin "Cantarnos" both feature intense, passionate melodies.Hill got a major assist from his quartet: Henderson (tenor sax), Davis (bass) and Haynes (drums). Hill had great chemistry with all three guys, and each would appear on at least one Hill recording after this one. Henderson's playing is more avant-garde than on contemporary albums such as Lee Morgan's Sidewinder and Grant Green's Idle Moment. Haynes could perform brilliantly in any context, while Davis's virtuosic bass playing is perfect for Hill's music. (I guess that's why he played on Hill's first seven albums for BN!) Together, Haynes and Davis push and pull against the soloists, giving Hill's music the flexibility it needs.Though Point of Departure might be a better album, Black Fire is probably a more accessible introduction to Hill's music. Be sure to check out his other Blue Note albums, including Judgment, Andrew!!! and Passing Ships.(Note: this review is based on an older reissue of the album. I have not heard the recent RVG remaster.)

This is the kind of album that probably generates the stereotype of free jazz as under-rehearsed, disorganized chaos. It's a shame, because you can clearly hear that Larry Young had something interesting to say in the free jazz idiom - but apparently these musicians were not the ones to do it. There's little of the overarching genius you hear on Coltrane, Cherry, Taylor or Sun Ra recordings from the same period. The horn soloists are generally not interesting and the two-drummer combination is diffuse rather than powerful.Despite my harsh criticism above, there's still some great music here - particularly when Larry is soloing. Larry Young fans probably want to hear this, but those expecting something on the level of Unity or Mother Ship will be disappointed.

John Coltrane recorded a LOT in 1965, and so some listeners might wonder whether Living Space is worth picking up -- especially since it wasn't released during Coltrane's lifetime, and two of the tracks aren't even titled. The answer is definitely yes, particularly for two tracks that rank among the best Classic Quartet recordings from 1965."Living Space" is unusual in a few respects; it's the last time Trane played soprano on a studio recording (at least as far as we know), but doesn't have much in common with his other soprano features, which tended to be catchy waltzes. ("My Favorite Things", "Afro Blue", "Chim Chim Cheree", "The Inch Worm", etc.) Also, Trane overdubbed his playing at the beginning and end of the tune; the two (?) soprano saxophones are slightly out of sync, creating a very eerie and trippy sound. It's interesting to hear Trane apply his increasingly free playing to the soprano, especially since he focused on the tenor almost exclusively (in the studio) from '64 onward.The second essential tune is the second of the "Untitleds" (track #4). Even as Trane's music became more free and avant-garde in the first half of 1965, the rhythm section often played "straight-ahead" swing under Trane's challenging and exploratory improvisations. Here they move away from that -- Tyner, Garrison and Jones abandon "time keeping" and essentially improvise collectively throughout the track. But Trane and McCoy's solos are focused enough, and the group so tightly integrated, that the result never rambles and maintains powerful forward momentum. The last section of the track, with McCoy laying down ominous chords to prepare for the saxophone's re-entry, and then Trane unleashing an incredible scream to open his final solo, is phenomenal. This tune looks ahead to some of the music on the quartet's final studio recordings (Sun Ship and First Meditations) as well as to the music Trane would make once Tyner and Jones left the band.The rest of the music isn't quite at this level. The best of the rest is the 1st "Untitled", #2, which again features some intense playing by Trane but this time over a more traditional backing -- Garrison laying down a walking bassline, Elvin Jones playing in a more swinging fashion. "Dusk Dawn" is kind of disappointing -- it has a long Jimmy Garrison solo in the middle and Coltrane doesn't play except in the opening and closing ensembles. (This tune, along with an alternate take, is also available on Kulu Se Mama.) "The Last Blues" (at five minutes, much shorter than the other 4 tracks) is almost a throwaway -- not bad by any means, but not adding much to the listening experience.If you're exploring the Classic Quartet's final recordings, I'd say to get Sun Ship, First Meditations, the live version of A Love Supreme, Transition, and The John Coltrane Quartet Plays before this album. But in a period of time where Coltrane was pushing the boundaries of jazz every other week with memorable and exciting results (Ascension was recorded shortly after these sessions), Living Space is definitely worth picking up.

Coltrane's 1961 Village Vanguard engagement is legendary - both for the quality of the music and for the controversy it generated at the time. This reissue is the best option for those who want just one disc of recordings from that engagement; these are the 5 tunes from the 1961 Village Vanguard engagement released during Coltrane's lifetime.Another option most listeners should consider is the 4-CD box set which contains all the recorded tracks from the Vanguard engagement. This isn't something for everyone - the box is pricier, and most of the tunes (including 4 or 5 that are not available on the Master Takes disc) are given multiple interpretations that may go over the head of the Coltrane neophyte. Nevertheless, the more you listen to the music, the more the variations between these radically different versions (each night has a different approach) come to the fore. Unless you are the kind of person that will end up with no more than 5 or 6 Trane discs, I would consider saving up the cash and getting the box.As far as the music, the most famous track is "Chasing the Trane" - a bare-bones blues with Coltrane on tenor, backed by only bass and drums. While later in his career would push the music out even further, by the standards of 1961 this was a very radical performance, with Coltrane's squawks, growls and screams as well as highly dissonant note choices. "Softly as in a Morning Sunrise" is the most traditional track from the box, showcasing how well Coltrane's quartet could function even in a more conventionally swinging format. Listen to Elvin on brushes! "Spiritual" anticipates some of Coltrane's later music - "After the Rain", "Alabama", "Song of Praise", A Love Supreme - though in this case, he's literally playing a tune based on an African American spiritual rather than expressing that sentiment. "India" makes explicit the link between Coltrane's soprano playing and the eastern music that it hinted at on earlier albums, and also has some fine bass clarinet playing from Eric Dolphy. "Impressions", with a similar structure to "So What" but at a much faster pace and more intense playing, again showcases Coltrane fronting a trio.Classic music, whether you opt for 1 disc or 4.

This lineup of the Jazz Messengers made a bunch of great albums for Blue Note and they're all interchangeable to some degree. This recording from Birdland somehow slips past the radar when discussing the Shorter-Morgan-Timmons lineup. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired (lots of distortion). It was also out of print for a while and there's another album recorded a year earlier with an almost identical name (&quot;At the Jazz Corner of the World&quot;) and lineup (sub Hank Mobley for Shorter).Nevertheless, it's worth picking up because this is an excellent performance by a terrific group. My favorite performances are &quot;Round About Midnight&quot;, &quot;The Breeze and I&quot;, and Hank Mobley's mysterious &quot;High Modes&quot;. (Despite not playing on the album, Hank contributed 3 of the compositions.) Aside from &quot;The Summit&quot; we don't hear much of Wayne Shorter the composer, but his playing, as on most music from this period, is intense and unpredictable. The album is worth buying just to hear Wayne.If you like grooving, intense hard bop, then the Jazz Messengers with Shorter, Morgan, and Timmons is an essential listening experience. And after checking them out on studio albums such as &quot;The Big Beat&quot; or &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;, it's definitely worth meeting them at the Jazz Corner of the World.

This 1954 live recording is a momentous one in jazz history -- it's one of the first recordings in a style that would be known as hard bop. Blakey's quintet, a clear forerunner of his Jazz Messengers, approaches the classic bop style, mixes in some soul and gospel, and cranks up the energy. Art Blakey's turbocharged drumming, Horace Silver's funky, blues-drenched playing, and the formidable frontline of trumpet wizard Clifford Brown and Bird disciple Lou Donaldson set the mold for the style.Highlights of Volume 2 are a blistering interpretation of the Kern-Fields classic "The Way You Look Tonight" and two Charlie Parker tunes, "Confirmation" and "Now's The Time". Clifford Brown really burns on these tunes. If you like this CD, be sure to buy Volume 1 as well as the two Bohemia recordings of Blakey a year later.

First things first: ignore the low average rating for this album -- this is one of Jimmy Smith's best (maybe THE best) albums and a major jewel in the crown of Blue Note records. It's not funky in the James Brown sense, it's funky in the heaps-and-heaps-of-soul, a-groove-six-feet-deep, &quot;What the hell is happening back at that chicken shack?&quot; sense.As far as groovin', bluesy B3 jazz, you really can't do better than this album. Donald Bailey has a heavy, booting swing and Jimmy Smith's chunky basslines propel the music along. Kenny Burrell's playing is beautiful here -- very subtle and tasteful, the yin to Jimmy Smith's powerful organ yang. And as far as I'm concerned, tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine is lifted to deity status by his playing on this session. Saxophone playing doesn't get any more soulful and meaty than this.The title track is just a blues, but what a blues it is. Jimmy digs in with the riff, Kenny plays one of his marvelous, low-key solos, and then Turrentine makes history with an absolutely mind-boggling huffin' and puffin' solo. Even the standards on this CD (classic interpretations of &quot;When I Grow too Old to Dream&quot; and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;) sound bluesy. And despite the fact that the title track is the most famous piece here, I think &quot;Messy Bessie&quot; is the best here. Judging by the song, she must be a fun girl to hang around.If you like this album, get its twin (recorded the same day), Midnight Special. Other great Jimmy Smith albums are Crazy! Baby, the Sermon, and Cool Blues. But I don't think any of them are as awesome as whatever the hell is going on Back at the Chicken Shack.

In the Soviet Union is a historically significant album for its venue - a jazz festival in Estonia, in the middle of the Cold War. Musically, I'd have to say it's less significant (though I may be in the minority here). Parts of it are great, other parts less so.First off, the great parts: "Days and Nights of Waiting" is an early Keith Jarrett composition, and one of his best from this period. "Love Song to a Baby" (which Lloyd had recorded a few times earlier in the decade) gets a lovely reading, and "Tribal Dance" is also very good (though the version on the album Love In is probably better)."Sweet Georgia Bright", I can't be as positive about. Based on Monk's "Bright Mississippi" (which is itself based on "Sweet Georgia Brown"), this is one of Lloyd's best compositions. He recorded it many, many times - on Cannonball Adderley's Fiddler on the Roof, and on his own albums Discovery, A Night in Copenhagen, Acoustic Masters I, Jumping the Creek, and Rabo de Nube. All those versions are better this one, which careens out of control at points and shows that Lloyd's playing in this point had deteriorated from its mid-60s peak (though it would recover later in his career). Still, even here, there are moments worth hearing.The second album on this disc, Soundtrack, is probably the weakest one the group recorded. The version here omits one track ("Voice in the Night", given a sadly lame reading so you aren't missing out on much). A better-sounding iteration that includes the missing track is available on the Atlantic reissue of the more famous album Forest Flower. As with In the Soviet Union, there are some fine moments here, all of them when Lloyd isn't playing tenor saxophone. The rhythm section grooves very hard, particularly on "Sombrero Sam" and the very funky second half of "Forest Flower".If you are interested in exploring Lloyd's discography, there are many better spots to start than here. But completists will want it for sure, and those that pick it up will find plenty to enjoy.

The Band's two acknowledged classics are Music from Big Pink and the second, self-titled album. Like the other reviewers, I prefer Big Pink. The Band is a great record, rooted in Americana, and definitely shows more a more developed approach; but Music from Big Pink is a completely timeless masterpiece. It has hints of 60s psychedelic rock, but has a rootsy aesthetic, with well-crafted songs and an almost obsessive emphasis on arrangements. Every song is a classic. Pianist Richard Manuel contributes about a third of the songs, including the anguished &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; (co-written with Bob Dylan) and &quot;In a Station&quot; while Robbie Robertson wrote the classic rock hit &quot;The Weight&quot; and three other songs. The album closes with a beautiful recording of Dylan's &quot;I Shall be Released&quot;. Music from Big Pink definitely belongs in your collection.

Presto and Roll the Bones pared down the wall of synthesizers that Rush was known for in the 80s, but it wasn't until this album that the band finally reverted into the heavy power-trio style. Though the songwriting is in the same straightforward, accessible style of the previous two albums, Alex Lifeson supplies more loud, distortion-laden riffs than he had in years. The music itself is erratic -- it starts out great ("Animate", "Cut to the Chase", "Nobody's Hero"), descends to an unremarkable mush in the middle and then finishes strong on the last four songs. Fans of the band's early, metal days may really enjoy this back-to-the-basics Rush.[This review is based on the 1993 original release, not the 2004 remaster. I have no issues with the original's sound quality.]

This is the last live recording of saxophonist John Coltrane; by the time it was committed to tape, he and his quintet had ventured deep into free jazz territory, alienating many of his original fans and polarizing the jazz world. The music abandoned harmony and pulse, instead consisting of ecstatic and/or frightening solos over a churning rhythmic backdrop offered by drummer Rashied Ali and several percussionists. And Trane's partner in the front line, saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, angered many fans with his harsh style of screams and groans.This performance gives you a taste of that quintet -- sort of. The sound here is really bad, like a below-average bootleg. (Much worse than the Coltrane/Monk recordings from the Five Spot, if you want a point of reference.) It deteriorates as the CD progresses and by &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, the only things you can hear are the horns and Ali's thrashing drums; those instruments are so distorted that Trane's soprano sax reminds me of Little Walter's harmonica on those great Chess recordings!That said, these are better performances than other currently available recordings of this band. (Live in Japan and Live at the Village Vanguard Again, both from 1966.) &quot;Ogunde&quot; is incredible, from Coltrane's anguished reading of the melody to his exploratory solo for the last ten minutes; Alice Coltrane contributes a piano solo -- one of the few places you can hear her on this recording. &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; is similar to other performances of this staple by this group: not many references to the melody, but instead a moaning and busy exploration beginning with a Jimmy Garrison bass solo and culminating with a saxophone duel by Coltrane and Sanders.This is not the first place to start with Coltrane, his Impulse recordings, or his avant-garde music. It is not even the place to start with his 1967 recordings -- Interstellar Space or Stellar Regions are both much more digestible and better-sounding recordings. But once you cut through the cobwebs of awful sound, the power and alien beauty of these performances cannot be denied.

There are those times in jazz when everything is pattering along, nice and pleasant, and then one musician starts playing and BOOM everything that's happened for the previous few minutes seems totally trivial. "Someday My Prince Will Come" (track #1 of this CD) is one of those times. Miles, Hank Mobley, and Wynton all play fine swinging solos; then John Coltrane plays an incredible solo at the end of which you ask yourself "Hank who?"Most of this CD features Miles's working band of the time, a quintet with Mobley in the tenor sax chair and the superbly groovy rhythm section of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. Mobley was a fine hard bop player, as some of his albums for the Blue Note label attest to (check out Soul Station, Roll Call or Workout), but he sounds a little uncomfortable here. The music looks back behind the progressive sounds of Kind of Blue and Milestones to the mid-50s quintet, though with a few exceptions it doesn't have the spark of that group. The exceptions include the two tracks with Coltrane ("Someday" and "Teo"), whose intense spiralling improvisations look ahead to those on "Ole" and "Africa"; the one track with Philly Joe Jones ("Blues #2"), where Miles and Philly Joe trade choruses almost telepathically; and "Pfrancing" (aka "No Blues"), where the rhythm section does what they do best. The ballads, played by Miles on mute, are a little anemic.The music on this album will please almost any jazz fan and includes some classic performances, but there are quite a few Miles Davis recordings that are more essential. If you want to hear the quintet (minus guests) at their best, check out the recently issued Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk.[This review is based on the 1999 reissue, which has excellent sound and an identical tracklist.]

This interesting album was Motian's first as a leader, from 1972. Though these days it's almost a cliche to refer to the "ECM sound", the label was very eclectic and diverse in its earliest years. Conception Vessel is no exception to that rule.Motian's first two albums for ECM (Conception Vessel & Tribute) remind me of Tony Williams's two 60s albums for Blue Note; in each case, an extremely innovative drummer showed off his chops as a composer, and at the same time broke stereotypes about what a drummer-led session should sound like. Not unlike Williams's debut (Life Time), Conception Vessel includes an array of different lineups.Two of the tracks include a trio of Motian, Charlie Haden and the underrated guitarist Sam Brown. (Sandwiched in between is "Ch'i Energy", a brief drum solo.) Brown plays acoustic on "Georgian Bay" and electric on "Rebica". This sound would be more fully realized on the 1974 album Tribute; the tracks start off somewhat aimlessly, but pick up in intensity and focus as they go along. "Rebica" in particular gets nice and wild in the end.Two other tracks ("American Indian" and "Conception Vessel") feature Motian in a duo with his then-boss, Keith Jarrett. "Conception Vessel", one of Motian's most memorable compositions, is given a brilliant performance here. Motian's compositions seem to bring out the more abstract side of Jarrett's piano playing. "American Indian" is a brief, pleasant but throwaway track with Jarrett playing flute rather than piano.The album's closer, "Inspiration from a Vietnamese Lullaby", is a quartet performance with Haden, violinist Leroy Jenkins, and flute player Becky Friend. The interplay between Jenkins and Friend is ecstatic and beautiful, creating a softer-toned variant on the 60s "New Thing". Haden's powerful, rich bass-playing anchors the performance (he plays great on the guitar-trio tracks as well) and Motian's restless drumming provides a lush carpet.I think the album Tribute, recorded two years later with Haden and Brown returning to the lineup, is slightly better. But if you like Motian's other recordings as a leader, the other musicians on this date, or avant-garde jazz it's worth picking up.

This is not a collection to pick up when you first start listening to John Coltrane. But let's say you have 20 Trane CDs from the Atlantic and Impulse eras and love the 1961 Village Vanguard and 1963 Birdland recordings. In that case, you owe it to yourself to pick up this box in some format.There are some reviews here that suggest this music is not as good as the better known Vanguard and Birdland recordings. Well, they're definitely not as well recorded. In addition, I would agree that they're not as consistently great as those recordings. But the best of the music here is just as great, and essential listening. Relative to the justifiably celebrated Vanguard recordings, the last few CDs showcase a much tighter group. These guys got a lot better as time went on.The music can be divided into three chunks. The first is the quintet with Eric Dolphy, which occupies the first CD and a half. These recordings are pretty notable for Dolphy's flute playing on "My Favorite Things", as well as the live versions of "Blue Train". The group is still evolving here, but it's great music.The fall 1962 recordings occupy the next 2 CDs. Dolphy's gone, the group's playing is tighter, but I think the limited song selection puts this behind the 1963 stuff.1963 - that stuff fills up the last three and a half CDs, and in my opinion justifies the purchase of this box. You get a wide range of tunes, including some relative rarities such as "Lonnie's Lament", "Spiritual", and "Cousin Mary". The versions of "Mr. P.C." and "Impressions" are particularly wild, with John and Elvin engaging in torrential duets.There are some complaints about the repetitions of the tunes - "Impressions", "Mr. P.C.", "My Favorite Things" and "Naima" each get numerous reads. Unlike the Vanguard, there's much less experimentation with instrumentation on this box, so to a neophyte it might seem more repetitive, but the performances are generally radically different and inventive. Give it time.Again, I would not recommend that a Coltrane newbie pick up this box. But if you're heard Trane at the Vanguard, heard Trane at Birdland, and think, gee, I would love to hear more of this music, then don't hesitate and press "buy".

This disc includes two albums by the Charles Lloyd quartet of the 1960s - In Europe and Journey Within. Neither is in the top tier of this group's work, but most people who like their other albums would enjoy this disc as well.In Europe was recorded in 1966, when the group was in its prime. (Part of the album The Flowering was also recorded at the same concert.) While none of the pieces are as well-known as Forest Flower, they showcase a fairly wide breadth of the quartet's work. "Little Anahid's Day" is a lovely waltz with Lloyd on flute, while "Manhattan Carousel" is one of my favorite pieces/performances by this group - a great start-stop avant-bop piece. Cecil McBee's great bass playing is highlighted here. The prior two tunes are the highlights of the album, but the rest of the album is not without interest. "Tagore" is an intriguing, though not entirely compelling, early look at the fusion of Indian music and jazz - Lloyd provides some exotic flute noodling while Keith Jarrett plays with the strings of the piano and Jack DeJohnette lays down a slow rockish groove. "Karma" and "European Fantasy" are both out-of-tempo tone poems - the former is prettier, like Coltrane's "After the Rain", the second more avant-gardeish. "Hej Da!" is the piece known on the ECM albums as "The Crossing" or "Prometheus". The ECM versions are better.Journey Within is from 1967, and the same Fillmore West concert(s) that yielded the album Love In. Unfortunately this album isn't nearly as good, and along with Soundtrack is my least favorite by the group. "Love No. 3" is, I think, Keith Jarrett's first recorded solo performance, and showcases the catchy, melodic, gospelly strain in his playing (Loves 1 and 2 are on the Jarrett-Haden-Motian trio album Life Between the Exit Signs, made around the same time). "Memphis Green" is a blues - but with a harder hitting groove, not a light jazz walk. "Journey Within" is a modal piece somewhat similar to "Tribal Dance"; it has its moments for sure (Lloyd's exotic flute playing) but goes on to for too long, getting all noodly and out of focus. And "Lonesome Child", which is the low point on this disc and includes an early appearance by Jarrett on soprano sax, is a much messier version of this tune than the one on Chico Hamilton's Passin' Thru album. It's the kind of stuff that unfortunately gave free jazz a bad name.Final verdict: if you like this group's other albums, check this disc out (or at the very least, the In Europe album). But Dream Weaver, the Flowering, Love In and Forest Flower are better albums.

May 1967 was the beginning of an amazing burst of studio creativity for Miles Davis; the first recordings in that burst are on this album. Sorcerer is even darker and moodier than its predecessor, Miles Smiles. (And even for a Miles Davis album, this is very moody and very dark.) It features less memorable tunes but the improvisations go even further away from the jazz mainstream. "Masqualero", a Wayne Shorter tune, is essentially an anything-goes performance with a Spanish tinge; there's a lot of fireworks in Miles's solo as the rhythm section rumbles under him, and Herbie Hancock's solo is a textbook example of tension and release. Another one of Shorter's compositions, "Vonetta", takes a quirky ballad and marries it to martial drumming by Tony Williams. There's also "Pee Wee", a Williams ballad with some beautiful playing. The other three tunes are similar -- haunting, dreamy themes coupled with complex group interaction. "Nothing Like You" is an odd vocal tune, a leftover from Gil Evans/Miles Davis sessions five years later that offers a bit of comic relief after the ominous music that precedes it; and two alternate takes ("Masqualero" and "Limbo") round out the album. If you like Miles Smiles and E.S.P., this is essential. But try those albums first.[This review is based on the 1998 reissue; both versions have identical tracklists.]

Weather Report released two self-titled albums in their career -- their classic 1971 debut, and this 1982 album. The latter is the last recording of the most popular Weather Report lineup -- Zawinul, Shorter, Pastorius and Erskine. Much like its predecessor, Night Passage, this one sounds like a very competent, professional band that's out of fresh ideas and rehashes old ones. There are the same tight, third-world grooves with layered synthesizers and floating saxophone, but you've heard it all before and the tunes aren't especially memorable. ("Volcano for Hire" is pretty cool nonetheless.) It's safe to skip this one unless you're a completist or raging Night Passage fan; and even if you are, you should probably jump ahead to 1983's superior Procession.[This review is based on the 1990 release, not the recent reissue. I do not know whether the new version has superior sound quality, but it does have an identical tracklist.]

The first four Weather Report studio recordings are filled with stylistic exploration and open-ended improvisation. By 1975's Tale Spinnin', though, Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul began to rein in the those two elements and emphasize catchy, concise songwriting. There's still some upbeat funk jams (&quot;Between the Thighs&quot;, &quot;Freezing Fire&quot;) but the band removes the dense rhythmic layers that had characterized earlier masterpieces like &quot;Cucumber Slumber&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie Waltz&quot;, freeing up Shorter to do more conventional soloing than he had on the previous two albums. His songwriting is a little disappointing, though, since &quot;Freezing Fire&quot; is mostly forgettable and &quot;Lusitanos&quot; shows the first signs of a smooth jazz style that would soon become Weather Report's trademark. Zawinul does a lot better: &quot;Badia&quot; is a beautiful piece of world-fusion sans Shorter, &quot;Five Short Stories&quot; is yet another nice duet (though not on the level of &quot;Blackthorn Rose&quot;), and &quot;Man in the Green Shirt&quot; combines a driving rock rhythm with a great melody. The rhythm section of Leon Ndugu Chancler and Alyrio Lima, while earthbound compared to its earlier counterparts, suits this music. And of course, bassist Alphonso Johnson is outstanding. Tale Spinnin' isn't up to the level of the earlier Weather Report albums, but it's still an excellent chunk of mid 70s fusion and definitely worth buying.

When I first picked this album up, I was tempted to dismiss a lot of it as elevator music. There are plenty of catchy melodies played played over third-world rhythms with instrumentation that we'd associate with the smooth jazz crowd. The compositions here are definitely closer to pop songs than on earlier WR albums. But further listening reveals a lot more depth; even a tune like &quot;Cannon Ball&quot; (Zawinul's tribute to his ex-boss, Cannonball Adderley), which is about as muzak-ish as this record gets, has an absolutely killer bridge. The drummer on most of the songs is Chester Thompson, who melds perfectly with Alphonso Johnson. There are quite a lot of highlights on this album -- &quot;Gibraltar&quot; (another groovy Zawinul number), Shorter's classic &quot;Elegant People&quot;, and the title track. Alphonso Johnson contributes a winner with &quot;Herandnu&quot; (these tunes are his swansong with the group), and his replacement Jaco Pastorius shows off his virtuosity on &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;. (Jaco also plays on &quot;Cannon Ball&quot;.) Though I prefer Zawinul's early playing on the Fender Rhodes, as far as synthesizer playing this is probably his peak. The Weather Report albums after this one are generally a lot less exciting but Black Market should be placed in shopping cart.

Weather Report's credibility with the critics was finally shattered with Mr. Gone. Not only did it feature the occasional concession to disco (this was 1978, after all), but the entire album had an electronic, studio-project feel that didn't fit in too well with the jazz ideal.Yet this album isn't all that bad: "The Elders" is an eerie Wayne Shorter piece in the b-movie soundtrack style, and "Pursuit of the Woman with the Feathered Hat" is a decent world-fusion piece descended from the Tale Spinnin' days. As far as clunkers -- well, the ballad "Young and Fine" is a quintessential elevator tune.The meat of the album, though, lies in the experimental oddities. They range from mildly weird (Shorter's "Pinocchio", rearranged from the Miles Davis days but faded out after just 2 minutes, Jaco's "Punk Jazz", which begins with a speedy bass-drums duet but switches into a somewhat cheesy ballad after a minute) to humorous (try not to crack a smile during the goofy disco-from-outer-space of Jaco's "River People") to downright bizarre (the title track, an avant-garde (?) attempt to reproduce jazz swing, walking bassline and all, using analogue synths). This album also has "And Then", a "song" featuring the vocals of Maurice White that never quite develops a direction but just fades out. Very strange.Anyway, a lot of Weather Report fans dismiss this as a one-off failure, preferring the chops-heavy 8:30 and Night Passage. But this album is also the last Weather Report album to feature really interesting experiments with sound. If you're curious, definitely pick it up.[This review is based on the 1990 issue of this album; the 2008 reissue has an identical tracklist.]

Jazz fans must have been thrilled when Weather Report left the studio experiments of Mr. Gone behind. Unfortunately, Night Passage doesn't really go anywhere. There's some cool improvisation (this was the jazziest WR album since I Sing the Body Electric) but the compositions themselves are mostly generic fusion. Wayne Shorter only contributes "Port of Entry", a sort of "Elegant People"-lite but easily the best tune on here. (Shorter also plays a lot of great tenor saxophone on this album.) Jaco Pastorius offers "Three Views of a Secret" and the band does a really cheesy cover of Ellington's "Rockin' in Rhythm". Zawinul does the rest of the songwriting and with the exception of "Fast City", it's unremarkable. Those who are interested in the chops of Peter Erskine and Jaco Pastorius will like the album but others may just be bored.[This review is based on the 1990 CD version; I do not know if the 2008 reissue has better sound quality, but the two have an identical tracklist.]

Conventional wisdom is that DS9 started hitting its stride in the 3rd season, when the Dominion arc really got going. I would beg to differ - while the series would continue to get better throughout its run, the 2nd season was excellent and comfortable matches in quality TNG's best.The first 18 episodes are somewhat erratic - you get some classics like the "Homecoming/The Circle/The Siege" opener, "Necessary Evil" and "Whispers"; some high quality semi-filler like "Cardassians", "Invasive Procedures", "Armageddon" and "Paradise"; and then dull nonsense like "Melora".Then, the last 8 episodes starting with "Blood Oath" are an incredibly strong stretch, which really showcases how good the series had become by this point. "The Jem'Hadar" launches the Dominion arc, but many of the show's other threads get their start here.Highly recommended.

Like a lot of Prestige "albums" recorded in the pre-LP era, Thelonious Monk & Sonny Rollins actually a mishmash of various sessions and leftovers tossed into one (very brief) package. There are three Monk albums on Prestige -- this one, The Thelonious Monk Trio, and MONK; each one draws from multiple sessions, and several of the sessions overlap across albums. (This is also an album with Monk's Christmas Eve 1954 recordings under Miles Davis's name.)This album is noteworthy for featuring two different occasions on which Monk teamed up with then-up-&-coming tenorist Sonny Rollins. Though Monk's other saxophone partnerships -- the long-term one with Charlie Rouse, and the short-term one with John Coltrane (can't forget Johnny Griffin either) -- get more notoriety, he and Rollins meshed very well. They'd reunite on Monk's Brilliant Corners (on Riverside) and Rollins's Volume 2 (on Blue Note). Though Rollins isn't quite at his mid/late-50s peak, he plays exceptionally well here. This is definitely some of my favorite pre-1955 Sonny.The first two tracks come from a 1954 quartet session. I have to emphatically disagree with one of the other reviewers about this music being substandard. On the contrary, "The Way You Look Tonight" is an absolutely superlative performance, and "I Want to Be Happy" is close behind. Sonny is just on fire here. It's true that Monk takes a relatively back-seat role compared to his work as a leader, but Spheroids can rejoice in his fascinating comping and an inspired solo on the 2nd track.The fifth track comes from a 1953 quintet session, with Julius Watkins joining in on French horn. Their low rumbling on the goofy theme of "Friday the 13th" is great. The sound on this session is poorer than the quartet session (Van Gelder didn't engineer this one). Rollins doesn't match his playing on the 1954 recordings, but still plays very well. Watkins's French horn (muted, I believe) produces a sound somewhere between a trumpet and a trombone. Monk's solo is terrific. Near the end Sonny and Julius trade bars, with Monk joining as a participant after a few exchanges.Then we have tracks 3 and 4, left over from one of the component sessions of The Thelonious Monk Trio (the same session that debuted "Blue Monk"). "Work" is indeed a classic and overlooked Monk tune, but "Nutty" is equally good and has a really nice Art Blakey solo.If you're fan of Monk and/or Rollins this album is absolutely essential. Whether you get it in this form, or as part of the Complete Prestige Recordings box (which might make more sense from a budgetary standpoint-- the Prestige albums are all ridiculously short), get it. Monk did some of his best work for Prestige.[This review is based on the 20-bit K2 remaster, which has excellent sound and an identical tracklist. I have not heard the RVG reissue.]

Keith Jarrett fans usually look at his 70s output in terms of solo performances (the Koln Concert) and the quartet with Jan Garbarek (Belonging, My Song, etc.) but often overlook one of his finest groups -- the American "quartet" with Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden, Paul Motian and the occasional percussionist.This live album features this group at its best: an eclectic mixture of Ornette-ish freebop ("Misfits"), Bill Evans-influenced lyricism ("Still Life, Still Life"), groovin' soul jazz ("De Drums"), and North African exoticism (the dramatic "Roads Travelled, Roads Veiled"). But the band's identity is so cohesive and unique that these are merely influences. Jarrett's playing is alternately funky and spiky, lyrical and dissonant, reflective and intense. Motian and Haden are an attentive, flexible rhythm section (whether soft or hard-hitting), while Redman provides fiery playing on the tenor sax and more quirky sounds on clarinet and the Chinese musette.Unfortunately Fort Yawuh is the only one of this group's eight Impulse! albums currently in print domestically; if you want to hear more, I suggest getting the 5 CD box set "The Impulse Years 1973-74". Unless you are really uncertain about this music or are really strapped for cash, I'd spring for the box instead -- it offers an entire additional hour of music from this concert as well as three other Impulse! albums (Treasure Island, Death & the Flower and Backhand). But even if you can't afford the better value of the box, I'd still get Fort Yawuh. It's one of Jarrett's best.

In terms of personnel this is the great Miles Davis Quintet of '55-'56 with altoist Cannonball Adderley along of the ride. But whereas the Quintet was a group that specialized in ballads and pop tunes, this new outfit swung a lot harder. Most of the tunes here are played FAST. During his hiatus from the Quintet, John Coltrane's saxophone playing had improved by leaps and bounds; and the rhythm section of Jones-Chambers-Garland had become even tighter. It's hard to pick highlights from such a stellar set -- Adderley and Coltrane trading choruses at lightning speed on &quot;Dr. Jackle&quot;, the incredible arrangement of &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot;, the pioneering modal ideas of &quot;Milestones&quot;, or the rhythm trio feature &quot;Billy Boy&quot;. I guess I'd go with &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot;, which features outstanding solos by everybody; listen to Miles at his 50s peak, or to Coltrane *and* Adderley play stack after dense stack of Coltrane's then-new &quot;sheets of sound&quot; technique! But this tune is just the first among equals. If you liked Kind of Blue, this album is absolutely essential for your collection.

This is the only album Miles Davis's 1st Great Quintet recorded for Columbia. Unlike the four classic LPs it cut for Prestige around the same time (Cookin', Relaxin', Workin' and Steamin'), which were recorded in two marathon sessions to capture a semi-live feel, 'Round About Midnight has a more polished and relaxed sound. Each approach has its advantages and fans will want all five LPs; the Prestige albums benefit from better sound quality and more spontaneous performances. But this reissue of 'Round About Midnight may be the place to start for several reasons. First, the recordings stretch from the Quintet's first recordings (October 1955) to about a year later, so you can track its progress. Second, at about one hour it contains more music than any of its Prestige counterparts. And third, it contains an absolutely classic rendition of Thelonious Monk's &quot;Round Midnight&quot; as arranged by Gil Evans; this performance brilliantly exploits the contrast between the soft lyricism of Davis's trumpet and the rougher playing of budding tenor star John Coltrane. This brilliance is matched or at least approached on each of the next five tracks, including a superb version of &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot;. Three of the bonus tracks come from the first session the quintet ever recorded, all in the bop style: &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot; (an early feature for Coltrane and recorded more effectively for the Milestones album), &quot;Budo&quot; (also featured on Birth of the Cool), and Jackie McLean's quirky &quot;Little Melonae&quot;. Pick up 'Round About Midnight and Cookin', and you'll find out why many considered this quintet to be the best of its time.

Jazz ideas had already been creeping into Santana's music on tracks like &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; and &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot;, but Caravanserai boldly moved deep into jazz-rock territory. The upbeat and catchy Latin rock of the band's first 3 albums was replaced by a more meditative, abstract and instrumentally-focused style influenced by Miles Davis's early electric bands and Chick Corea's Return to Forever.Most of the band's original members are still here (Gregg Rolie, Mike Shrieve, Chepito Areas) but their roles have changed dramatically. Mike Shrieve suddenly steps up in the compositional department and his drumming really improves. Check out his Elvin Jones-isms on &quot;Waves Within&quot;. Gregg Rolie sticks to keyboards (lots of electric piano) and the remaining vocals are pleasantly inconsequential. Guests make a big difference -- Tom Rutley's acoustic bass is a nice touch on many of the tunes, and future keyboardist Tom Coster makes his first appearance on a Santana album. Carlos and Neil Schon play off each other really well. The tunes range all over the map, from the epic &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot; (the guitar riff that ends the intro is awesome) to serious funk (&quot;Look Up&quot;) to percussion duets (&quot;Future Primitive&quot;).The influence of Latin music is still here in a big way with the gentle Jobim cover &quot;Stone Flower&quot; and the grooving instrumental &quot;La Fuente del Ritmo&quot;, but people expecting the Classic Santana will be disappointed. Nevertheless this is one of Santana's best albums, right up there with Abraxas; whereas their later jazz-rock efforts were often mixed bags, it works here in a big way.

This is a really nice album. It's a little mellower and less overtly funky than many of the albums Cannonball would later record with the quintet. Instead, what you have is Cannonball and two rhythm sections working their way through a set of lesser-known standards.Maybe just because it sticks out as the sole non-standard of the set, "Barefoot Sunday Blues" is my favorite tune on the set, and a wonderful showcase for Wynton Kelly's blues playing. But "I Remember You", "If This Isn't Love", "I've Told Ev'ry Little Star"... nice to hear Cannonball tackling these tunes, and without another instrument to take up front line space.Highly recommended.

The first few times I listened to this album, I was somewhat disappointed. It's grown on me a lot since then. Sonically it's quite similar to the trio's previous album on ECM,I Have the Room Above Her. There's lots of sophisticated, subtle interplay between the three musicians, but with a mellower, less explosive sound than their albums on JMT/Winter&Winter; and Soul Note. Don't expect any squealing electric guitar by Frisell or free jazz screaming by Lovano.Favorite tracks: some nice free-ish jousting on "Onetwo", the very melodic "K.T.", and Thelonious Monk's very funny "Light Blue". "In Remembrance of Things Past" is nice, but doesn't hold a candle to the very intense version recorded onTrioism.I'd check out I Have the Room Above Her or some of their albums on JMT/W&W; before this one, but if you like those albums then you will probably appreciate this one as well.

Most of the Cannonball Adderley Quintet's best-known recordings were recorded live, or pretended to be. This, the Quintet's 2nd album, is an exception. As a result, it doesn't match the hot intensity of their best live recordings. That said, it has its own charms.It took a while for the group to settle on a pianist - Bobby Timmons lasted for only one-and-a-half albums, and is replaced by bebop specialist Barry Harris on four tracks.The album is best known for Nat Adderley's "Work Song" and Timmons's "Dat Dere". "Work Song" gets a nice runthrough here, but is a pale shadow of later live versions. It's also worth highlighting Duke Pearson's "Jeannine", one of the best performances on this album.In general I favor this group's live work, but upon revisiting Them Dirty Blues I found it to be very enjoyable. Recommended!

This was one of Coltrane's transitional LPs, released between two of his best-known albums (Giant Steps and My Favorite Things). In fact, the original album draws from sessions that made up both albums -- one track ("Village Blues") from the My Favorite Things/Coltrane Plays the Blues/Coltrane's Sound sessions (October 1960), and the other 7 from the sessions that also produced one classic tune for Giant Steps ("Naima", December 1959).As you would expect, the album has a transitional feel, fitting in between its better known neighbors. While most of the performances are very good, few of them have the bracing impact of the best Coltrane Atlantics and I wouldn't put this one in the first tier. (My personal favorites are Coltrane's Sound, Coltrane Plays the Blues, and Giant Steps.) "Village Blues" was most listeners' first taste of the McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones rhythm section, and sounds similar to another minor blues recorded around the same date ("Equinox", on Coltrane's Sound).The 1959 tunes are divided between more traditional, conservative tunes and more radical experimentation, all with the great Wynton Kelly/Paul Chambers/Jimmy Cobb rhythm section as backup. The best of the experimental tracks is "Fifth House", based on Tad Dameron's "Hot House". Like "My Favorite Things", "Ole" and many other noteworthy performances, Coltrane spends much of his time improvising intensely on one vamp. "Harmonique" is another interesting tune -- Coltrane incorporates saxophone multiphonics (playing more than one note at a time) into the song's melody, providing an exotic sound. I feel the song is hamstrung a bit by the more traditional rhythm section, which sounds a little too tight. Out of the more straightforward tracks, "Some Other Blues" is a very nice preview of the Coltrane Plays the Blues album (even if it doesn't quite match the heights of that album); "Like Sonny" is a very catchy tune that combines Latin and straight-ahead rhythms; "I'll Wait and Pray" is a beautiful if not quite top-of-the-line Trane ballad performance; and "Little Old Lady" and "My Shining Hour" are two nice bouncy performances.As far as the bonus tracks, the most interesting are two takes of "Like Sonny" from the March 1959 (pre-Giant Steps) session. Lex Humphries and Cedar Walton (I think) replace Cobb and Kelly, making the rhythm section a little more beboppish.If you like Giant Steps, Coltrane's Sound, and My Favorite Things, Coltrane Jazz is definitely worth picking it up, though it probably isn't the most essential of the Coltrane Atlantics.[This review is based on the deluxe edition, which has an identical tracklist.]

John Coltrane has a reputation as a fearless pusher at the boundaries of jazz, but he was also one of the great blues players in jazz. Hence it's not surprising that he released an entire album of blues compositions. In lesser hands, this could have turned into an exercise in monotony; but the six compositions on Coltrane Plays the Blues are wildly diverse, keeping things exciting the whole way through. He plays tenor sax on four tunes and his then-new soprano on two. McCoy Tyner sits out on a few tracks, leaving a piano-less trio of Coltrane, Steve Davis and Elvin Jones. "Blues to Elvin" is more traditional, and very "down home". "Blues to You" is the most avant-garde performance, a barebones trio performance that clearly anticipates "Chasin' the Trane" (from the 1961 Village Vanguard engagement). "Mr. Knight" has a theme similar to "India" (also from the Vanguard) though it doesn't maintain the same one-chord drone.Overall this is a fantastic album. Any fan of Coltrane's other Atlantic albums should pick it up. This was one of three albums Coltrane recorded with his new quartet in October 1960 -- get all of them. (The other two were My Favorite Things and Coltrane's Sound.)

Since I'm the first one to give this CD less than 5 stars, there's some chance that I'm completely missing the point. That said, I don't really understand the effusive praise that it gets; there are a bunch of jazz recordings made in the mid-60s that I would recommend over this one, including some by Charles Lloyd himself.This CD actually contains two albums. The first, and more famous, is Forest Flower: Live at Monterey, which contains the Lloyd quartet's legendary performance at the 1966 Monterey Jazz Festival. Judging by the other reviews, the performance of "Forest Flower" seems to be very popular. To my ears, Lloyd's playing on this tune is somewhat rambling and aimless; Keith Jarrett's brilliant playing and the nice groove generated by Cecil McBee and Jack DeJohnette are the best things about it. There are better versions on Lloyd'sVoice in the Night(on ECM) and Chico Hamilton'sMan from Two Worlds(on Impulse).The other track from the Monterey performance is "East of the Sun", which gets a brisk post-bop (with hints of free jazz) interpretation. The balance of the album was recorded in the studio; Jarrett's "Sorcery" is sort of avant-jazz-rock piece (Lloyd on flute) and McBee's "Song of Her" is a lovely ballad (though perhaps better performed on Lloyd'sThe Water Is Wide(on ECM)).The second album on this CD, Soundtrack, is a live performance from 1968. Lloyd's tenor playing is even weaker than it was on the Forest Flower album. It opens with a smoking version of Lloyd's "Sombrero Sam", which has a much tighter, funkier groove than the original studio version. Fantastic. I think this version of "Voice in the Night" is not very good. The album closes with another version of "Forest Flower", after a mediocre introduction on solo tenor ("Pre-Dawn"). This one starts out inferior to the '66 version, but during the second half the rhythm section just locks into this incredible funky groove. One of the highlights of this disc, as far as I'm concerned.My recommendation is to check out a bunch of Lloyd's other albums, both from the 60s (Dream Weaver,Flowering/Warne Marsh) and the 90s (Canto, Voice in the Night), before this one. It's enjoyable but he's done better. If you like those then this one is worth checking out. If nothing else, this one features a fantastic rhythm section.

This is the second installment of Thelonious Monk on Blue Note, recorded 4 years after Genius of Modern Music Volume 1. Though it doesn't feature as many of the pianist's most famous compositions as Volume 1, it has several things going for it. The sidemen are much, much better here -- Monk and vibraphonist Milt Jackson play very well together, while Sahib Shihab and Art Blakey &quot;get&quot; Monk's ideas much better than they did on Volume 1. (Listen to Blakey's rim shots on the intro to &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot; -- awesome!) The second half of the CD features Max Roach and two up-and-coming stars -- alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson and underrated trumpeter Kenny Dorham. The compositions aren't Monk's most popular (except for &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot;), but contain quite a few lost classics: &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, &quot;Four in One&quot;, &quot;Eronel&quot;, and &quot;Skippy&quot;. There's also a beautiful reading of the standard &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;. I actually prefer The Thelonious Monk Trio (on Prestige/Fantasy) over this CD, but this is still classic early Monk. And if you like this music, get the RVG remaster of Volume 1 too.By the way, there's a mistake in the CD case track listing and consequently on this site: track 7 is not &quot;Nice Work if You Can Get It&quot; but rather an alternate take of &quot;Four in One&quot;.

Those were Horace Silver's words describing the horn section of the 1st edition of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Kenny Dorham and Hank Mobley weren't the flashiest players, and they were overlooked in the era of Miles and Clifford and Sonny and Trane. But they were also gifted improvisers and composers, as the Bohemia recordings clearly show. Kenny was more boppish than Miles but definitely a middle-register trumpeter; while Hank had a mellow, soulful sound perfect for hard bop. Add the tireless drums of Blakey and the blues-drenched piano of Horace Silver, and you've got a winning combo. This is the same lineup that recorded the classic album Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers about a year earlier; but there aren't any Silver compositions on either volume of the Bohemia recordings.Volume 1 focuses primarily on Kenny Dorham's contributions. &quot;The Theme&quot; and &quot;Minor's Holiday&quot; are fast-paced performances with some of Kenny's best playing on record, while &quot;Prince Albert&quot; is a variant on &quot;All the Things You Are&quot;. Several standards are also tackled including a delightfully swinging &quot;Soft Winds&quot;. If you like this CD, be sure to pick up Volume 2 of At the Bohemia as well as Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers (also on Blue Note) by the same group.

The official line is that Miles Davis's &quot;comeback&quot; from heroin addiction and relative obscurity happened at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival. But the truth is that Davis had been recording actively in the studio during all of 1954, and that the results ranged from excellent to spectacular. The bulk of the music he recorded that year was for the Prestige label; it was packaged primarily on three LPs: &quot;Walkin'&quot;, &quot;Bags' Groove&quot;, and &quot;Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants&quot;. Though all three are essential for the Miles Davis fan, this one is probably the best. For one, four of the tracks come from Davis's only session with the pianist Thelonious Monk. (The other two tracks from that session are on &quot;Bags' Groove&quot;.) Monk and Davis didn't get along -- Davis hated Monk's angular comping, and demanded that the pianist lay out during the trumpet solos. But Monk rose to the challenge, providing some inspired solos. For two, the other three musicians (all members of the Modern Jazz Quartet, hence the name of the LP) play really well. Vibraphonist Milt Jackson rarely played better, while few rhythm sections swung harder than Percy Heath and Kenny Clarke. For three, Miles Davis plays some of the most beautiful trumpet solos of his career; the ballad playing on both takes of &quot;The Man I Love&quot; is absolutely gorgeous, while on the more up tempo numbers his clear tone rings out like a bell. For four, the performances are incredible -- &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot;, &quot;Swing Spring&quot;, and the two takes of &quot;The Man I Love&quot; are all desert island material. As an added bonus, this CD includes a take of &quot;Round 'Midnight&quot; recorded by the Quintet with Coltrane and Garland two years later. This version is not quite as memorable as the one recorded for Columbia but is excellent nonetheless. There is no excuse for not owning this wonderful album, especially in the crystal clear 20 bit remastered version -- it is one of the best of Miles Davis's career.

When Miles Davis formed his classic 1st Quintet, he negotiated a record deal with Columbia records. Before he could release anything through Columbia, however, he had to fulfill recording obligations for the indie label Prestige. In two marathon sessions (May and October '56), the Quintet recorded enough material for four albums: Cookin', Relaxin', Workin' and Steamin'. Cookin' was the first to be released and despite its brief running time (33 minutes), features the strongest material and the best song selection. The two bop tunes, two blues and one ballad provide a balance that isn't really present on the other three albums. &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; is a quintessential Davis ballad performance, with the mute trumpet and gently swinging rhythm section. &quot;Airegin&quot; and &quot;Tune Up&quot;, on the other hand, feature the Quintet at its tightest and most intense - none of the other bop tunes from these sessions come close. Since live recordings of this group aren't easy to come by, Cookin' and the other 3 may be the best taste of what this great group sounded like in person.

The title track of this album announced to the world (though only a few people were listening) that Miles Davis was back after several years of heroin addiction and erratic playing. Miles had pioneered the cool style four years earlier, but on Walkin' he and his companions went in the opposite direction -- focusing on the groove and the blues in a style that would soon be known as hard bop. On &quot;Walkin'&quot;, Kenny Clarke and Percy Heath set up a mid-tempo groove over which Miles blows some incredible trumpet; trombonist J.J. Johnson, pianist Horace Silver, and the underrated saxophonist Lucky Thompson rise to the challenge as well. &quot;Blue'n'Boogie&quot; is given the same treatment but at a much faster pace. On both these numbers, the new LP format allows the musicians to really stretch out and develop their ideas. Side 2 of the album has the same rhythm section, but Johnson and Thompson are replaced with Bird-clone Dave Schildkraut. The playing is mellower -- &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is&quot; and the beautiful Davis ballad &quot;Solar&quot; as well as the more energetic &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot;. Walkin' was the first Miles Davis classic since the Birth of the Cool and is absolutely essential to any fan's collection.

Like a lot of Prestige "albums" recorded in the pre-LP era, Thelonious Monk & Sonny Rollins actually a mishmash of various sessions and leftovers tossed into one (very brief) package. There are three Monk albums on Prestige -- this one, The Thelonious Monk Trio, and MONK; each one draws from multiple sessions, and several of the sessions overlap across albums. (This is also an issue with Monk's Christmas Eve 1954 recordings under Miles Davis's name.)This album is noteworthy for featuring two different occasions on which Monk teamed up with then-up-&-coming tenorist Sonny Rollins. Though Monk's other saxophone partnerships -- the long-term one with Charlie Rouse, and the short-term one with John Coltrane (can't forget Johnny Griffin either) -- get more notoriety, he and Rollins meshed very well. They'd reunite on Monk's Brilliant Corners (on Riverside) and Rollins's Volume 2 (on Blue Note). Though Rollins isn't quite at his mid/late-50s peak, he plays exceptionally well here. This is definitely some of my favorite pre-1955 Sonny.The first two tracks come from a 1954 quartet session. I have to emphatically disagree with one of the other reviewers about this music being substandard. On the contrary, "The Way You Look Tonight" is an absolutely superlative performance, and "I Want to Be Happy" is close behind. Sonny is just on fire here. It's true that Monk takes a relatively back-seat role compared to his work as a leader, but Spheroids can rejoice in his fascinating comping and an inspired solo on the 2nd track.The fifth track comes from a 1953 quintet session, with Julius Watkins joining in on French horn. Their low rumbling on the goofy theme of "Friday the 13th" is great. The sound on this session is poorer than the quartet session (Van Gelder didn't engineer this one). Rollins doesn't match his playing on the 1954 recordings, but still plays very well. Watkins's French horn (muted, I believe) produces a sound somewhere between a trumpet and a trombone. Monk's solo is terrific. Near the end Sonny and Julius trade bars, with Monk joining as a participant after a few exchanges.Then we have tracks 3 and 4, left over from one of the component sessions of The Thelonious Monk Trio (the same session that debuted "Blue Monk"). "Work" is indeed a classic and overlooked Monk tune, but "Nutty" is equally good and has a really nice Art Blakey solo.If you're fan of Monk and/or Rollins this album is absolutely essential. Whether you get it in this form, or as part of the Complete Prestige Recordings box (which might make more sense from a budgetary standpoint-- the Prestige albums are all ridiculously short), get it. Monk did some of his best work for Prestige.

Mysterious Traveller, from 1974, continues in the steps of Sweetnighter, focusing on extended groove-driven improvisation with plenty of that wonderfully layered percussion. It was pretty clear on the previous album that the jazzy rhythm section of Miroslav Vitous and Eric Gravatt wasn't quite up to these kinds of rhythms, so here they're replaced by Alphonso Johnson (bass) and Ishmael Wilburn (drums). The jewels of this album is the double-punch of Zawinul's &quot;Cucumber Slumber&quot; and Shorter's &quot;Mysterious Traveller&quot;, which like &quot;Boogie Woogie Waltz&quot; on the previous album combine super-catchy melodies with some serious grooving. (Alphonso Johnson is amazing on these tunes.) But this album isn't just about funky jamming -- there's a beautiful piano-soprano duet (&quot;Blackthorn Rose&quot;), an unclassifiable piece (&quot;Scarlet Woman&quot;), some proto-world-beat (&quot;Nubian Sundance&quot;), and a brilliant Zawinul orchetration (&quot;Jungle Book&quot;). On the last two tunes, by the way, Shorter is almost completely absent -- Zawinul's expanding array of synthesizers is becoming the dominant sound of the group. This is the most stylistically diverse of the Weather Report albums and the last truly great one.

This album was the parting shot in Santana's jazz-rock phase, following Welcome and the brilliant Caravanserai as well as various collaborations with Alice Coltrane and John McLaughlin. Drummer Mike Shrieve, a crucial element in this band's sound and conception, would depart (he only plays on about 60% of this album); and increased pressure from Columbia Records would push Carlos Santana and Tom Coster to revamp the band with a more commercial sound.But regardless of the pressure, it seems like the band was running out of steam. Borboletta is schizophrenic -- one half is 2nd-rate R&amp;B songs, the other half is intense fusion workouts. Leon Patillo's vocals make you long for the gutsy but limited Gregg Rolie (though Patillo sounds kind of cool on &quot;Give and Take&quot;), the tunes aren't all that memorable, and the lyrics are downright embarrassing. Most of the fusion jams fail to match the magic of Caravanserai and Welcome, though &quot;Promise of a Fisherman&quot;, rising gradually to a crescendo with wordless vocals, is glorious. But too many rough spots make this an inessential purchase for casual Santana fans.

Jaki Byard was a guy who loved the entire jazz tradition, past present and future, and freely used to it in his playing. But regardless of whether he was going out on an avant-garde limb or rollicking with some stride piano, he sounded like Jaki Byard and nobody else.This album (probably named in order to piggyback on the success of that other Experience) showcases Byard's sprawling imagination, and I guess to a few it might feel a little too schizophrenic. However, I never get that feeling; instead, I hear music that never marks off any part of the musical field as &quot;out of bounds&quot; as long as the outcome is a good one. Roland Kirk was the saxophone counterpart to Byard, and the Byard-Davis-Dawson rhythm section was easily among the best of the 60s (they can also be heard playing with Booker Ervin, Eric Kloss, and others). At some level, you could probably call this a tribute album to Byard's piano predecessors, but it's a tribute that has a lot more to do with Byard than with Powell, Garner or Monk.&quot;Parisian Thoroughfare&quot; (originally by Bud Powell) stands out first -- the wild, avant-garde opening by Kirk's unison reeds (sounds like rush hour on the thoroughfare!), then a series of intense but more straight-ahead solos by Kirk and Byard. &quot;Evidence&quot; is shorter but has the same fiery approach. &quot;Shine on Me&quot; is an upbeat, gospelly tune with Kirk contributing clarinet. Eubie Blake's &quot;Memories of You&quot; is a lovely duet for Byard and Kirk with an old-time feel (though Byard's solo throws in some subtle modern touches). Throughout the album there's a wry sense of humor, and it's hard not to break into a smile at least once (probably more) while listening.This is a wonderful, essential recording. In the liner notes to a different album, Keith Jarrett writes, &quot;Although I'm often considered eclectic, I don't think I fit this category because I see various ways of expression as part of the same flow; the same attempt. I don't see it as different 'things'...&quot; I'm sure Jaki Byard would say the same thing about The Jaki Byard Experience.

This album suffers from the same problem as most of Santana's later albums -- there's just not much there. The melodies are still catchy, Carlos's guitar is still scorching, and the danceable Latin rhythms are still there, but the music is bland and the musicians are faceless. There are high points, particularly on the opening trilogy of songs, on the exoticism and wordless vocals of &quot;Verao Vermelho&quot; and on the Cuban romp &quot;Maria Caracoles&quot;. The instrumental ballad &quot;Revelations&quot; is also pretty cool, turning from an instrumental ballad into a burning duel between Carlos and Tom Coster's synth. But about half of this album is middle-of-the-road late 70s R&amp;B. You have to contend with the AOR-disco hybrid &quot;Let the Music Set You Free&quot; and the cheesy ballad &quot;The River&quot;. And Leon Patillo must be one of the lamest vocalists in Santana history. I guess the best thing you could say about this mixed bag is that Santana would get worse on albums like Inner Secrets and Marathon; but unless you really like the (superior) Amigos, I'd stick with the earlier Santana albums.

This album is routinely mentioned as a classic and one of Sonny Rollins's best. For whatever reason, that acclaim doesn't translate into the same popularity attained by Saxophone Colossus. Nevertheless, if you like Sonny Rollins's playing or jazz from the mid-to-late 50s then you should definitely put this one in your shopping cart.Sonny was one of the big innovators of the saxophone trio format -- saxophone, bass, drums -- and this was his first recording with such a lineup. Getting rid of the piano has several implications. The first is that the harmonies become a lot less obvious to the listener without the piano banging out the chords every few seconds. The second is that there's a lot more pressure on the musicians --- particularly the saxophonist, but also the bassist -- to generate interest without using piano solos as a crutch. There's a lot more space to be filled in, and in the hands of lesser musicians this space would turn into gaping holes.Fortunately, Sonny Rollins is one of jazz's greatest improvisers. The fact that he doesn't have to share solo space with a pianist on this recordings means he can let loose some brilliant, unfettered and uninterrupted improvisations. There's a LOT of Sonny's playing on this album. Sonny's notorious for the humor/wit in his playing and there's a ton of that here.Sonny's companions on this date for Contemporary Records were bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne. Manne was one of the premier drummers on the west coast and appeared on a lot of Contemporary sessions. Manne wasn't a "power drummer" like most of the drummers that appeared on Sonny's east coast recordings (Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, and Max Roach). That means that he's content to be an accompanist rather than an almost equal partner a la Max Roach.The compositions offer a nice amount of variety. "I'm an Old Cowhand" is the kind of semi-cheesy tune that Sonny specializes at transforming and gives the album a great start. "Come, Gone" is just straight-up fast bebop. "Solitude" and "There Is No Greater Love" are intense ballad performances. "Wagon Wheels" is a medium-tempo jam, and "Way Out West" closes the album on a jaunty note. The overall mood is more mellow and introverted than Saxophone Colossus; the album was recorded in the middle of the night, so this is not surprising.One annoying thing about some versions of this album is that the alternate takes are placed in the middle of the album (immediately following the masters), destroying the album's original sequence. I recommend looking for the now-out-of-print 20 bit remaster or any other version that places the alternates at the end of the album, where they belong. The alternate takes are actually fascinating to explore once you get to know the original album, as two of the tunes are given much longer explorations.This album is highly recommended and an essential part of any collection. If you like Sonny in a trio format, other albums to check out are A Night at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note), The Freedom Suite (Riverside/OJC), and East Broadway Rundown (Impulse!). I'm probably forgetting some others. And of course, if you haven't heard Saxophone Colossus, be sure to pick that one up.

Recorded in May of 1976, this was one of the American group's final official recordings. They had recorded the better-known Survivor's Suite a month earlier and in October would return to the studio one final time to record the albums Byablue and Bop-Be. Tthe group plays as a quartet, minus the percussionists that added color to earlier albums. (Jarrett, Redman and Motian all double on various percussion instruments.) Around this time personal tensions between the group members were worsening, and judging by their final three albums, beginning to have a negative impact on the group's music.The most obvious problem with this album is the near-absence of Dewey Redman. I'm not sure exactly why Dewey doesn't come in until 2/3 of the way in track 2 (the official story is that he was drinking wine offstage), but this seriously detracts from the music -- in my opinion, his dark, gruff melodicism was the perfect foil for Jarrett's more lyrical/flowing style. In addition, the work of the rest of the group seriously falters in Redman's absence. Motian and Haden are much more lethargic than usual, and drop out for extended periods of time. Keith spends a lot of the time playing solo piano, and the music is much more repetitive and less interesting than the well-known solo concerts from this period. (He also has a lengthy soprano solo near the beginning.) There just isn't much going on for those first 25-30 minutes.Once Redman comes in, about 10 minutes into track 2, the music improves dramatically. The vamp that Keith had been playing for the previous 10 minutes intensifies, and Haden and Motian suddenly wake up. Dewey PLAYS a dark, intense solo. The encores begin with a calypso (Dewey briefly hints at "St. Thomas", I think), followed by a brief Motian drum solo and then an Ornette-type piece with Keith on soprano. Keith has a very nice solo, and then Dewey wails on tenor. The last encore is a brief piano improvisation by Keith.Overall, this is one of the American group's weakest albums; just compare it to the brilliant Fort Yawuh, recorded 3 years earlier at the Village Vanguard with the group at the peak of its powers. Nevertheless, the end of part 2 and the first two encores are enjoyable and worthy of being mentioned alongside their other work, though not necessarily alongside their BEST work. There are occasional flashes of interest on other parts of the album. If you're a Keith Jarrett completist, pick this up. Otherwise, if you're exploring with the American group start with the Impulse boxes (or the single CD release of Fort Yawuh) or (if hell-bent on picking up only KJ albums on ECM) The Survivor's Suite.

The first half of this 1972 album consists of studio recordings that continue the collective approach of the self-titled debut, but the arrangements are better developed and the amount of loose collective improvisation is more restricted. Zawinul's genius as an arranger becomes more apparent on his compositions; he uses three vocalists and three additional horns on the ominous &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; to brilliant effect. &quot;Second Sunday in August&quot; uses a more pared back arrangement but a memorable melody and driving rhythm make this one of their best early tunes. Wayne Shorter, not to be outdone, contributes &quot;The Moors&quot; -- a great eerie piece featuring Ralph Towner on 12 string guitar. (And his fierce tenor sax blowing on &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; is outstanding -- he would never sound this good in Weather Report again.) The rhythm section of Gravatt/Vitous/Romao is incredible. The second half of the album features an edited 20 minute excerpt from Live in Tokyo; though the music is fantastic, you should try to pick up the imported, unedited copy. This is one of the group's best albums, though it may not be the Heavy Weather fan's cup of tea.

Lotus was recorded during the heart of Santana's jazz-rock period. But whereas Caravanserai and Welcome (whose lineup is featured here) are relatively quiet, meditate affairs, Lotus is a fiery testament to a band that was at its peak. The guitar playing, mixing speaker-frying leads with more avant-garde sounds, foresees the style Pete Cosey would perfect with Miles Davis a year later; and the rhythm section has loosened up to the point were they can switch from groove to groove effortlessly. Leon Thomas contributes a few vocals (&quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; and his trademark yodelling on &quot;Mr. Udo&quot;) but the music is almost entirely instrumental.The long fusion jams -- &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot;, &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot; and an absolutely bonkers &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; -- are definitely high points of this concert. But you can't overlook the 30 minute medley that closes disc 1 either. The only real weak spot is Mike Shrieve's long drum solo &quot;Kyoto&quot; (hey, this was the 70s). If a sound halfway between Caravanserai and Miles Davis's acid funk albums Agharta/Pangaea sounds exciting, you must hear this.

Young Keith Jarrett was interested in a lot of different music -- gospel, rock, folk, free jazz, jazz piano trios, soul jazz, classical piano music -- and decided to put it all on Expectations. On about half of the album, he features the &quot;American quartet&quot; with Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian. The other half has guitarist Sam Brown subbing for Redman. Two pieces include both Brown and Redman. Airto chips in with percussion on some tunes, while a couple of tracks feature string or horn sections.The least interesting music on here (at least to me) is the rock-oriented stuff with Brown (&quot;The Magician in You&quot; and &quot;Expectations&quot;). Things get better on the challenging and rambling &quot;Nomads&quot; (reminiscent of Jarrett's stuff with Miles). &quot;Common Mama&quot; is one of the high points of Jarrett's career -- an infectious Latin rhythm and a catchy melody, fun brass interjections, some smoking tenor playing by Redman, and even some KJ soprano. &quot;Roussillion&quot; and &quot;Circular Letter&quot; are Ornette-ish pieces. &quot;There Is a Road (God's River)&quot; begins with an abstract solo piano intro, then bursts into one of those joyous, rollicking gospel-infused pieces that Jarrett *owned* in the early 70s.There are so many different ideas on Expectations that I doubt anybody would like everything on here (kind of like the Beatles' White Album). Jarrett would become a more mature player on later recordings. But few of those recordings would have the same sense of fun that pervades this album; what Expectations lacks in coherence, it makes up in youthful enthusiasm.

No CD comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but the first minute or so of "St. Thomas" -- with Max Roach setting up the calypso beat on his toms and then Sonny coming in on sax -- is about as close as it gets. What a perfect introduction to Sonny Rollins, and maybe jazz in general. "St. Thomas" is the most memorable performance here, due to the insanely catchy melody, but the other tracks are equally rewarding. "You Don't Know What Love Is" is a superb reading of the ballad. "Moritat" (better known as "Mac the Knife") swings along leisurely while "Strode Rode" chugs along at a more hectic pace. And "Blue 7" is a blues (obviously) that allows all four musicians to stretch out, with a particularly inspired solo by Rollins. The two guys that really shine here are Sonny and Max Roach, but you can't forget Tommy Flanagan's always-tasteful piano and Doug Watkin's tight bass playing. Saxophone Colossus is one of the first jazz CDs a jazz newbie should hear, and if you like it pick up Sonny's Way Out West and A Night at the Village Vanguard as well.[This review is based on the K2 20-bit reissue, which has great sound. The tracklist is identical to the RVG.]

This 3 CD box set covers recordings from September 1968 to February 1969; as such it covers a lot more than the actual In a Silent Way sessions, but nevertheless illustrates how Miles and his cohorts moved from the spontaneous abstraction of the Second Great Quintet to an ethereal sound that merged jazz, rock, and R&amp;B. If you want to hear this transition, pick up the box; if you don't feel the need, all you really need is the eventual remaster of the original album. So it's for hardcore Davis fans only, but those fans will be very pleased.Disc 1 opens with the first session to include bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea. The languid, bluesy &quot;Mademoiselle Mabry&quot; and the furious boogaloo &quot;Frelon Brun&quot; are essential tracks from the classic album Filles de Kilimanjaro, and should really be heard in that context. Of the next four tracks, &quot;Two Faced&quot; is a lengthy post-bop exploration while the last 3 tracks are somewhat cheesy boogaloos (especially &quot;Dual Mr. Anthony...&quot;) salvaged by genius of the musicians. The last track, &quot;Splashdown&quot;, has never been previously released.Disc 2 is where the music really starts to move to new territory. Joe Zawinul's composition &quot;Ascent&quot; is a beautiful though slightly unfocused tone poem, a clear predecessor of &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Orange Lady&quot;. If you like the shimmering keyboard trio sound of In a Silent Way, you'll love this. On the other hand both takes of &quot;Directions&quot; fuse jazz improvisation with a pounding rock backbeat; though live performances of this tune are more intense, this version definitely has its charms.Disc 2 continues with the actual In a Silent Way sessions and the first appearance of guitar virtuoso John McLaughlin: an amusing though inessential bossa nova version of Zawinul's &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;; the take of &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; that eventually appeared on the album; and Teo's original mixes for &quot;It's About That Time&quot; and &quot;Shhh/Peaceful&quot;. The latter is a real surprise and gem -- it was originally a harder-hitting piece and Tony Williams played more than just the hi-hat!It's disc 3, though, that makes this package worth it: first, two previously unissued tracks with the In a Silent Way lineup plus Joe Chambers on drums. &quot;The Ghetto Walk&quot; is a grooving, bluesy piece not unlike the Bitches Brew material, while &quot;Early Minor&quot; is a gorgeous ballad in the Silent Way mold. And then the original In a Silent Way album. If you haven't heard the delicate beauty of this album, you are really missing one of jazz's masterpieces.

This is one of the all-time great Mingus albums, recorded around the same time as the better-known Mingus Ah Um. There's enough of a similarity between them that fans of one will almost certainly like the other, but they each have a different focus. Ah Um is a great introduction to Mingus's scope as a composer; Blues & Roots is more narrow, focusing on grittier material influenced by gospel and the blues. Blues & Roots also has a slightly larger ensemble than Ah Um, with two trombones and four saxophones present on each track."Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting" starts things off. Though quite similar to "You'd Better Git It in Your Soul", its melody is more simple. However, the ensemble playing is white hot and Booker Ervin takes another one of his "sermon" solos over handclaps. "Cryin' Blues" is the shortest track and features intense playing by Jackie McLean. "Moanin'", my personal favorite on the album, begins with a naaaaaaaasty baritone riff by Pepper Adams that slowly expands into raucous collective improvisation by the group. "Tensions" is a similar tune, though at a slightly lower temperature. "My Jelly Roll Soul" is almost exactly the same tune as "Jelly Roll" from Ah Um. "E's Flat Ah's Flat Too" (recorded elsewhere as "Hora Decubitus") closes the album with a blistering, swinging ride.The strength of the album, besides the memorable riff-based compositions, is the blending of collective improvisation with strong solo performances. Ervin, McLean, Adams, John Handy, Jimmy Knepper and Willie Dennis are the perfect frontline for this kind of mix, and Mingus is just the right "conductor" to kick things along. If you like Mingus, or are merely curious about his music, Blues & Roots is essential listening.(One caveat: the sound on this deluxe edition, as on most Atlantic jazz albums from this period, is terrible.)

Ole was Coltrane's last word on Atlantic, and generally has a more avant-garde edge than its predecessor albums. It was recorded around the same time as Trane's first sessions for Impulse (Africa/Brass) and bears a lot of stylistic similarity to the music on that album, as well as the legendary Village Vanguard recordings from later that year. Like those albums, this one has an expanded lineup - not only the quartet of Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman, and Elvin Jones, but also multi-reedist Eric Dolphy, second bassist Art Davis, and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.The album stands on the strength of the first track - the mammoth "Ole". Like "My Favorite Things", recorded 9 months, this is a piece in 3/4 with Coltrane playing soprano. UNLIKE "My Favorite Things", this is a much more abstract and challenging performance - it was not going to generate a jukebox hit. The performance isn't "perfect" - a few of the musicians (particularly Hubbard) sound a little lost without the scaffolding of chord changes. But once the bass duet gets going, we enter the realm of pure magic. Coltrane's 4 minute solo to close out the piece is incredible, one of his best ever on the soprano. Classic.The next two pieces (as well as the bonus track) are nice, but none of them are personal favorites - as on some other albums, one track dominates so much that the rest feels a little underwhelming. While I wouldn't call this recording my favorite from the Atlantic years, anyone making the transition from "casual" to "semi-serious" Coltrane fan should pick it up.

Coltrane was a pretty rare musician - a guy who in the span of his career innovated and managed to achieve commercial success, often at the same time. This album is a great example - as you can see from many other reviews, a lot of fans consider this to be an extremely accessible, and yet at the same time, it was a pretty pivotal recording in the evolution of jazz.First, the hit 14-minute interpretation of "My Favorite Things" was a major milestone in the incorporation of modal improvisation into jazz music. Coltrane and his former employer Miles Davis were most responsible for offering modal jazz as an alternative to the chord-based improv of bebop (and Coltrane's classic album Giant Steps). But "Milestones" and "So What" are still tied to bebop in terms of structure - there are only a few chords, but they repeat at predetermined times. "My Favorite Things" took modal jazz one step further - each chord goes on as long as the soloist wants. This allowed Coltrane to stretch "My Favorite Things" or contract it, depending on what his group felt like doing. He'd keep playing this tune in concert right up until his death in 1967.Second, this was (almost) most fans' first encounter with Coltrane's classic quartet featuring pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones. McCoy had played with Trane since the summer and Elvin had joined just a month or so before this album was recorded, so some fans caught them in concert; and the Coltrane album released right before this one, Coltrane Jazz, included one track with this lineup. Still, this album clearly showed that Coltrane had put a great lineup together. (Only one piece is missing - bassist Jimmy Garrison - who would join at the end of 1961.) Though the group's sound was still at its early stages, it's amazing how much of it is already in place - "My Favorite Things" sets the stage for later classics like "Ole", "Out of This World", "Afro Blue" and A Love Supreme.Third, this was the first released example of Coltrane playing the soprano saxophone (you can see him playing it on the album cover). He'd already recorded with it a few months earlier on The Avant-Garde, an album not released until 1966, but most fans had not heard him playing it. The eastern-sounding instrument was apparently very popular because many of his contemporaries soon began playing it as well. Besides "My Favorite Things", this album contains an unusual example of Coltrane playing a ballad on the soprano - the lovely "Every Time We Say Goodbye".I guess I should wrap up this long review - but two more comments. The first two tunes tend to overshadow the second half of the album because they aren't as innovative, but "Summertime" is an absolutely must-listen monster performance. Second, this album was recorded at sessions which also generated the albums Coltrane Plays the Blues and Coltrane's Sound. Those two albums are just as essential as this one - if you like My Favorite Things, pick them up ASAP.

This album begins unassumingly, but on a perfect note -- a few musings by pianist Brad Mehldau, then Charles Lloyd gently and lovingly playing the melody of Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;Georgia&quot;. Lloyd doesn't venture very far from the melody during his solo, but manages to extract something profound from this old classic. And despite all the comparisons to Coltrane, Lloyd's current playing is reminiscent of Stan Getz (with a dash of Wayne Shorter) more than anything.The rest of the album continues in the same reflective mood. There are a couple of originals (including the piano-saxophone duet &quot;The Monk and the Mermaid&quot;), some traditional material (a drum-sax duet on &quot;There Is a Balm in Gilead&quot; and a gorgeous interpretation of the title track), and a few chestnuts by Ellington and Strayhorn. There are occasional instances of relaxed swing and bossa nova, but most of the pieces are ballads.Billy Higgins, who would pass away shortly after these sessions, plays with incredible sensitivity; his drumming on &quot;Georgia&quot; is exquisite. John Abercrombie doesn't appear on all the tracks but plays beautifully. This recording would not be complete without the strong, resonant bass of Larry Grenadier and Brad Mehldau's rich piano playing.I liked much of this album immediately, but it's grown on me even more in the past year. It's not flashy or innovative, but &quot;merely&quot; the work of 5 great musicians. I highly recommend this to any fan of John Coltrane's &quot;Ballads&quot; or similar material. More material from these sessions is available on the album Hyperion with Higgins.

After the orchestral sound of the previous two albums, the band goes for a more stripped-down, organic sound. The keyboards are still there but take a less prominent role and the power trio sound begins its gradual return to center stage. Alex Lifeson uses the acoustic more frequently and adopts a more assertive, riff-oriented style on the electric. Some of the songs aren't that great (&quot;Superconductor&quot;, &quot;War Paint&quot;, etc.) but they're outnumbered by quality material. &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot;, &quot;The Pass&quot;, &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot;, and &quot;Available Light&quot; are outstanding; &quot;Red Tide&quot;, &quot;Presto&quot;, and &quot;Anagram&quot; are close behind. This transitional album may appeal to those who think Rush suffocated in synths during the 80s even though the music here is far mellower than the 70s albums. This overlooked album belongs in every Rush fan's collection.

This fits in with other Turrentine I've heard from this period. Though the piano replaces the organ that Turrentine, this is firmly in "groove" territory rather than what you'd characterize as straight-ahead hard bop. The rhythm section is heavy, clearly influenced by soul music rather than the light swing of bebop. Stanley takes plenty of solos, but they're more about soul and passion, as well as contrast with the orchestration, rather than navigation a series of chord-based choruses. The other players are mostly in the background, though we get occasional spotlights on a few of them including Blue Mitchell, Grant Green and McCoy Tyner.The material draws primarily from popular music. The absolute highlight for me are the funky read of Sam Cooke's "Shake", but there isn't a bad tune here. Duke Pearson's orchestrations are a good match for the music.I'd say The Spoiler, recorded later the same year with a similar lineup, is a better album, but if you like one then the other is worth getting too.

For many fans, this is probably where DS9 got interesting - the Dominion arc got going here. But I think that overall this season isn't much better than the underrated 2nd season, and not as strong as the final four. Unlike the 2nd, which was uneven at the beginning but really strong near the end, this one is much more even - there are great, good and decent episodes interspersed throughout. There are three or four duds, including the lame "Meridian". And of course there are classics too - "Visionary", "Improbable Cause/The Die Is Cast" and especially "The Adversary". Besides the Dominion Arc, a lot of the other key threads in the show - Bajoran culture and religion, the Cardassians - get some nice exploration here. They would also play a key role in the series' final resolution, and ignoring them as a viewer would be (in my opinion) an unfortunate judgment.Overall, a very strong season, but if you compare it to the four that follow, merely a prelude for the great things ahead.

After several very good seasons, DS9 really hit its prime in season 5. At this point each of the show's arcs had picked up enough steams they could pretty much run on themselves; earlier investment in characters, particularly recurring ones, paid off dividends. Worf, who'd felt somewhat tacked on as a publicity plot in season 4, was merging much better into the cast and with the rest of the storyline. As always there was a dud or two ("Ferengi Love Songs" is the worst in this batch), but even the middle of the pack is fairly strong. The classics are well-known: "The Ship", "Rapture", "In Purgatory's Shadow", "By Inferno's Light", "Empok Nor", and the classic original-series tribute "Trials and Tribble-ations". The one episode I'd single out for props is "A Call to Arms" - perhaps the best season finale that DS9 ever had.It's a shame that many people lose interest in DS9 during the first season and a half - because if you have made it this far, the decision really pays off. Great science-fiction television!

Watching many of these episodes, it is amazing (and fortunate) that the show lasted beyond one season. While only a few of the episodes fall into the flat-out terrible category, most of them are extremely ho-hum and only a minority would rank as even average in comparison to the standard set in later seasons. The show comes up short in nearly every category - bad acting, lame stories, one-dimensional characters, awful writing, corny music, excessive preachiness and comically bad special effects. In many of the episodes, any actual appeal comes simply from laughing at the hilarious B-movie (or C-movie!) cheesiness of it all.TNG was not an arc-based show at this point, and most viewers not obsessed with completeness can safely skip ahead to later seasons. There are several episodes that I would characterize as worth watching - "Justice" (because it is so hilariously awful), "Conspiracy" (the best of the season), "Datalore", "Heart of Glory", "The Arsenal of Freedom", "Encounter at Farpoint" (primarily for the second half, though the first 45 minutes provide plenty of unintentional laughs) - and a handful of others that are decent.The show would improve quite a bit in the (much-maligned) second season and really hit its stride in season 3. Unless you are a completist or really big on nostalgia, the premiere season can be skipped.

On balance, the second season of TNG was a big step forward. Everything about TNG, especially the acting and writing, had improved greatly over the show's first year. At the same time, the writers hadn't quite figured out how to consistently write good, much less great, episodes.Whereas most of the main characters were, at best, rough sketches in the 1st season, most of them finish the second season quite similar to what they would be in the rest of the series. Only Worf would have a substantial way to go. In addition, three new characters are introduced -- Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur). While Muldaur's character was never on the show long enough to fully adapt, and in general I prefer Gates McFadden, she definitely improved and was not the disaster that some fans suggest.This season is definitely highlighted by "The Measure of a Man" (a series classic by any measure) and "Q Who" (which introduces the fan-favorite villain Borg), as well as the underrated "Time Squared". There are also a handful of other very good episodes. The rest of the season is generally unremarkable, generally better than season 1 but weaker than later seasons. Special criticism should be reserved for the awful "Shades of Grey", but it's worth noting that this exceptionally bad episode is not representative of the season as a whole.Overall, everybody but hardcore fans could skip owning this season - though the better episodes are definitely worth watching.

Canto was Charles Lloyd's fifth album for ECM, and like the first four featured Lloyd in front of a piano-bass-drum rhythm section. (Canto features the same musicians as The Call and All My Relations: Bobo Stenson, Anders Jormin and Billy Hart.) Much, though not all, of the material on those early albums is quiet, slow-pace and introspective. Canto has that same inward-looking vibe, and the music often moves along at a measured pace, but it adds a focused intensity that wasn't always present on earlier recordings.&quot;Tales of Rumi&quot; begins quietly and mysteriously, the rhythm section slowly building tension over several minutes to prepare for Charles's entrance. He comes in, solos briefly with a Middle Eastern motif, then stops the rhythm section for a majestic invocation on tenor. The band then resumes and plays the same material they did in the beginning at a much faster tempo. After a Stenson solo, Charles re-enters with some of the most ferocious playing he's offered in the past twenty years. It's an incredible jazz performance.The music mellows out after this intense workout. There are two beautiful ballad performances on &quot;How Can I Tell You&quot; and &quot;Desolation Sound&quot;. The title track is a slow-paced piece that doesn't go anywhere in particular but at least makes the journey enjoyable with lyrical playing by both Lloyd and Stenson. &quot;Nachiketa's Lament&quot; is a dirge featuring Lloyd's mournful playing on Tibetan oboe. The album then regains momentum. &quot;M&quot; opens with an unaccompanied bass solo by Jormin before locking into a groove. Bobo Stenson solo turns up the heat before Lloyd comes in with some intense wailing. The album finally wraps up with an exhilarating, luminous rubato ballad a la &quot;After the Rain&quot; or &quot;Ogunde&quot;. These last two performances evoke the classic Coltrane quartet in the best sense.All four musicians are on top of their game. Charles's playing is some of the fiercest and most focused of his career, Bobo Stenson is superb as both a soloist and an accompanist, and Billy Hart's powerful drumming is captured beautifully by the ECM engineers.Lloyd's next few albums after Canto have a different sound, adding John Abercrombie on guitar and placing Billy Higgins behind the drums. For whatever reason, those excellent albums get a lot more hype than this one. That's unfair, because Canto offers a sense of mystery and emotional depth that they don't always match; it's my favorite.

I think MMW's best work was on the 3 Gramavision albums and that their Blue Note work has been more hit and miss (I haven't heard Uninvisible). This one, their last for Gramavision, is where they completed the transition from an eccentric Downtown NYC piano trio into a more electric, funky group.You won't hear any of Medeski's piano playing (but he offers lots of organ, electric piano, clavinet and synths) and the band's avant-garde roots are buried in electronics. There aren't any off-the-wall interpretations of Ellington or Marley either. Instead, the trio starts off with a catchy hook and then just grooves away. The music can get pretty repetitive and a lot of the time nothing is going on (but it's a very funky nothing). Still, it's a good choice of music when you are studying or hosting a mellow get-together. And &quot;Is There Anybody Who Love My Jesus&quot; and &quot;Think&quot; are classics.If you like this album, get its superior predecessor Friday Afternoon in the Universe.

Until they hit it big with Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd were very much a live band; "A Saucerful of Secrets", "Careful with That Axe Eugene", "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" and "Interstellar Overdrive" each got a dry run in the studio, but it was on stage that the magic really happened. When the band became extremely popular, Floyd shows became increasingly scripted. By the time the group recorded this album, in the late 80s, little of the energy and excitement of the group's early days was left. This album may be "live" but it doesn't sound like it.The Momentary Lapse stuff sounds decent; "On the Turning Away" improves on the original version, and "Dogs of War" sounds much better than the awful studio version. It's the more popular 70s music that kills this recording. The band's failure to credibly pull off this material is often blamed on Roger Waters's absence, but I don't buy that; it's just a general lethargy and going by the numbers which makes "Wish You Were Here", "Us and Them", "Time" and "Money" sound lackluster. The beginning of "Another Brick" is offensively bad, a groan-worthy moment. Only "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" and a smoking version of "One of These Days" stand out.Overall, this is one of the weakest things to be released under the Pink Floyd name. At least the studio disc from Ummagumma had a soul. If you want a document of the later Floyd in action, check out Pulse; but better yet, watch Live at Pompeii or try to get your hands on an "unofficial" recording from the early 70s, when the band was at its live peak.

In principle, this live concert from 1972 follows the same approach as Weather Report's self-titled debut: ensemble improvisation where pretty much anything goes. But whereas the debut is a dreamy, laid-back affair, Live in Tokyo is a fierce, aggressive document of a band that was more &quot;free&quot; than &quot;fusion&quot;. (Compare this to Miles Davis's 1970 Fillmore concerts, which have a similar point of departure.) Zawinul's playing on the Fender Rhodes is dissonant and processed with primitive electronics, and on the acoustic piano he's all over the place -- from Bill Evans-like meditations to messing around with the piano's innards. Wayne Shorter, little more than sonic wallpaper on some later albums, blows like a madman on the tenor and soprano saxophones. And the rhythm section (Miroslav Vitous, Eric Gravatt, Dom Um Romeo) is the most spontaneous in WR's catalogue, and arguably the most exciting. The music is organized into 5 lengthy medleys, containing some material from Weather Report's debut as well as otherwise unreleased stuff. There's also a compact, blistering version of Zawinul's &quot;Directions&quot;. This music is not for the faint of heart (fans of Black Market and Heavy Weather won't find much to like here) but showcases a band at the peak of its abilities. This essential live recording isn't available domestically so snap it up while you can!

This is the sequel to Counterparts, with an even heavier sound. There aren't many memorable melodies and after a while the crushing guitar riffs get a little monotonous. There's still good stuff on here -- The frantic &quot;Dog Years&quot; may be the first (intentionally) funny Rush lyric, while other highlights are &quot;Driven&quot;, &quot;Carve Away the Stone&quot;, and &quot;Resist&quot;. This is not one of the band's better albums, though fans of Counterparts may enjoy it.

Anybody who listens to post-WW2 jazz eventually has to come to terms with altoist Charlie Parker, a.k.a. Bird. But Bird's recording output was so immense that finding the right starting point is difficult. If you feel bold and have a large wallet, definitely spring for the Savoy &amp; Dial box set. As an introductory package for the Bird neophyte, however, this set is probably a better choice. There are so many classic recordings here --&quot;Salt Peanuts&quot; (electrifying!), &quot;Koko&quot;, &quot;Now's the Time&quot;, &quot;The Hymn&quot;, &quot;Donna Lee&quot;... It samples from Bird's entire career -- from the early, proto-bop sessions with Dizzy Gillespie and a swing rhythm section to his classic Quintet with Max Roach and a very young Miles Davis. Later recordings include a reunion with Dizzy (&quot;Bloomdido&quot;), some of the recordings with strings, and several tracks from a live performance with Dizzy and Bud Powell. If you're visiting the Birdhouse for the first time, walk in through the Yardbird Suite.

This is a weird pairing of two great albums.The Flowering is one of the best of the late 60s Charles Lloyd albums on Atlantic -- inferior only to Dream Weaver, in my opinion. Lloyd's tenor playing, occasionally noodly or unfocused on some of this quartet's recordings, is quite powerful here. The rest of the quartet (Keith Jarrett, Cecil McBee, and Jack DeJohnette) is in fine form on these 1966 live recordings from Europe. The material leans quite heavily on progressive post-bop, with less of the accessible crossover material that appears on other recordings.The album opens with a brisk take on Kurt Weill's "Speak Low", including a great solo introduction by Lloyd. "Love-In" gets a more mellow, less peppy interpretation than on the album of that same name; after a gospelly solo by Keith Jarrett, it leads to the first of two versions of "Island Blues", this time with Lloyd on flute. "Wilpan's" is an up-tempo modal number composed by McBee, reminiscent of "Impressions" and "So What". "Gypsy '66" (aka Gabor Szabo's "Lady Gabor") gets an intense, lengthy workout with some intense Lloyd flute and one of Jarrett's best solos from this period. The album closes with yet another medley including "Island Blues", this time with a nice downhome solo by Lloyd on tenor.The Marsh set is also excellent. On two of the tracks, Marsh is backed by a quartet that includes Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones. On the rest, it's a piano-less trio with Chambers and Paul Motian. Chambers gives a standout performance, and Marsh offers some of that oblique, enigmatic tenor that seems to anticipate Wayne Shorter (at least to my ears).This release is highly recommended for fans of Lloyd and/or Marsh.

In general, Cannonball was at his best live - and into that category, I'll throw in some of those late 60s pseudo-live albums. There was a certain intensity the Cannonball bands built up in front of a crowd that it never matched in a regular studio recording.However, that lack of intensity is compensated for by other qualities on this great LP. This was Cannonball's second sextet - Yusef Lateef had left and was replaced by Charles Lloyd. Overall, Lateef was probably a better player, but Lloyd's contributions to this band were definitely worthwhile.Fiddler was also Cannonball's first album for Capitol. While the criticism of the Capitol albums as overly commercial and pop-oriented is misplaced, it should be stated this is a completely straight-ahead jazz recording. Louis Hayes and Sam Jones are still here, and at this point they were tighter than ever.Because it's a studio album, there's a stronger tilt toward arrangements. Some tracks feature only one musician. The highlight is obviously the title track, with Sam Jones and Louis Hayes locking into a nice Coltraneish groove over which we get great solos by Cannonball, Nat, Charles Lloyd and Joe Zawinul. The two ballads near the end, "Now I Have Everything" and "Tell Me You Love Me", feature the super ballad-playing talents of Cannonball and Lloyd, respectively. And Cannonball's solo on "Sewing Machine" is among my favorite by him on any album.Highly recommended!

In the beginning, Weather Report was a cooperative. Composition duties were split between the three leaders (Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Miroslav Vitous) and in performance, each of the 5 musicians was an equal participant. This album, from 1971, is exemplary of this approach. Though informed by Bitches Brew-era Miles Davis, the rhythms are much looser and the music is more playful. (There's also quite a bit of 60s post-bop in &quot;Eurydice&quot; and a few of the other tunes.) Most of the compositions are simple, relying on the sophisticated interplay of the group to generate excitement. There's also one genuine classic, Zawinul's gorgeous &quot;Orange Lady&quot; (another less successful version is available on Miles Davis's album Big Fun). Zawinul's keyboard set-up is limited to just electric and acoustic piano, but he produces an incredible range of sounds -- just listen to the spaced out &quot;Milky Way&quot;, which could have been an outtake from the first two or three Tangerine Dream albums. Unlike later efforts, Wayne Shorter plays a lot of (soprano) saxophone here. Fans of Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way should definitely pick up this classic fusion recording.

This is one of the few currently in-print Chico Hamilton CDs. Hamilton led a series of groups on during the 50s and 60s -- first, a "chamber jazz" quintet that featured a cello player and no piano (Eric Dolphy got his start with this combo on The Original Ellington Suite, and an earlier lineup featured Jim Hall and Buddy Collette); then, once saxophonist Charles Lloyd joined the group and became its musical director, the group moved toward from their 3rd-Streamish format to a more dynamic, straight-ahead post-bop sound. Lloyd's partners on the front line were the unique guitarist Gabor Szabo and (on some albums) trombonist George Bohannon. It's probably the trombone, but the group's sound reminds me a little of the 60s Jazz Messengers; at other times it evokes the more radical sound of Ornette Coleman's late 50s quartet.Lloyd's compositions for this group were generally interesting and distinctive, and four of the ones here appear on later Lloyd albums. As far as his tenor saxophone goes, I actually tend to prefer his work with Chico and (a littler later) Cannonball Adderley to that with his famous 60s quartet. Whereas on the albums with Jarrett and DeJohnette he sometimes loses focus and noodles too much, his playing here is intense and focused. As far as the other musicians, I'm not a huge trombone fan and don't think Bohannon's solos are especially interesting. Gabor Szabo plays better elsewhere. Albert Stinson is a very underrated bassist, though I think he's better recorded elsewhere."Sun Yen Sen" (which appears on the Lloyd ECM album Hyperion with Higgins under the title "Secret Life of the Forbidden City") and "The Vulture" are hard-bop tunes. "Voice in the Night" is one of Lloyd's finest ballads, appearing on the 60s album Soundtrack and the 90s album Voice in the Night. It's a nice performance, more focused than the Soundtrack version but more superficial than the one recorded in the 90s. "Island Blues" is a catchy tune that Lloyd recorded both later in the 60s and in the 90s; here the group just does a short 2 minute version without any improvisation. "A Different Journey" is another memorable melody and performance, one of the best on the album; this time, Charles plays flute. The centerpiece of the album is an unusual composition, "One Sheridan Square" is the most unusual tune here. The melody is long and complex, running through a few moods; each of the four musicians besides Chico improvises at length, first over a brisk post-bop swing and then over a free-ish ballad section. Bohannon and Szabo's solos are alright, but Lloyd's 5 minute improvisation is intense and exciting, at points evoking "Chasin' the Trane". Definitely the highlight of the album.Overall I don't think this album is essential (3.5 stars might be closer to the mark), but it is interesting and I think Charles Lloyd fans will want to pick it up. I would get the superior Man from Two Worlds (Impulse!) first, then pick up A Different Journey if you want some more.

This was the final Mahavishnu album of the 70s, and quite different from the group's earlier work. Four songs are essentially cheesy, light r&b;/funk with vocals. Some of the instrumental tracks are also more commercial than the challenging material of earlier albums.The album's strongest tracks are "All in the Family", "Lotus Feet" and "Inner Worlds". McLaughlin does some early experimentation with a guitar synthesizer. "All in the Family" features some intense playing over an churning African-Latin beat; "Lotus Feet" would be given better performances by various incarnations of McLaughlin's other band, Shakti; and "Inner Worlds" almost sounds like an early precursor of techno.This album is only recommended for McLaughlin completists. Otherwise stick to Mahavishnu's earlier albums.[This review is based on the domestic reissue of the early 90s. The tracklist is identical]

I recently got an itch to listen to some Traffic and put this album onto my ipod. As the band's debut, it features the original lineup of Steve Winwood, Dave Mason, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood. Though the mix of rock, blues, R&B;, folk and jazz that characterizes the band's sound is already here, there's also a heavy dose of 1967 psychedelia.The music is generally excellent. "Paper Sun", "Heaven Is in Your Mind","No Face, No Name, No Number", "Smiling Phases", "Coloured Rain", the goofy "Berkshire Poppies" and the radio staple "Dear Mr. Fantasy" are all classic Traffic tunes. Unlike later Traffic albums, the songs are generally short -- most are under 5 minutes.There's some confusion over whether to pick up this album or the one titled Mr. Fantasy, as they both contain the same material in different running order. (The mixes are also slightly different, but I haven't paid attention to this.) As far as the original LPs, Heaven Is In Your Mind is the stronger album -- it replaces two of the weaker Dave Mason tracks with the superior "Paper Sun", "Smiling Phases" and "Hole in My Shoe". However, with the presence of bonus tracks you can pick up either album and (almost) create the other using your MP3 player or CD-R.Overall I highly recommend this album -- it's a 60s classic.

This is the first of two Live at the Village Vanguard albums from the Paul Motian trio. Recorded in June 1995, it consists mostly of Motian originals, all 6 of which were first recorded in the 70s or 80s. The lone standard of the set is a beautiful interpretation of the ballad "You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart".Unlike its sister disc, Sound of Love, the sound on this one is much more oriented toward free jazz. Bill Frisell also leans into that screaming, distorted sound more frequently. The performances range from the beautiful, melancholy "Folk Song for Rosie" to the uninhibited, intense skronk of "The Sunflower". "Yahllah" (first recorded with Keith Jarrett in 1976) is given a brilliant, loose performance. Motian breaks into straight-ahead swing during Lovano's solo, as well as on several other numbers in this set. Other highlights are "Abacus" and the humorous "Owl of Cranston".Overall this isn't the trio's best album for JMT/W&W;, but it's well worth picking up if you are a fan.

Ornette Coleman emerged from retirement in 1965 with one of his most exciting groups -- a trio featuring bassist David Izenzon and drummer Charles Moffett. It's great to hear Ornette stretch out more than in the early Atlantic recordings and his interplay with Izenzon and Moffett is practically telepathic. Ornette's playing is lively, humorous, and very melodic; he plays alto sax exclusively on this CD.This RVG reissue almost doubles the playing time of the original CD issue, with alternate takes of the freebop gem &quot;Faces and Places&quot; and the goofy waltz &quot;European Echoes&quot; as well as the previously unreleased &quot;Doughnuts&quot;. Volume 2 is also great though slightly more &quot;out&quot;.

Thelonious Monk could really shine in the trio setting, where his unflagging creativity and memorable tunes could occupy the spotlight. These ten selections from '52 to '54 showcase that side of Monk wonderfully; and almost all of them are brief (less than 4 minutes), providing bite-sized intros to a nice chunk of his material. As a bonus, the drummers (Art Blakey or Max Roach) understand Monk's conception perfectly. Three of the tunes feature Monk's idiosyncratic playing on standards (&quot;Sweet and Lovely&quot;, &quot;These Foolish Songs&quot;, and the solo feature &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;). The other seven are recording debuts of songs that would become jazz standards -- &quot;Monk's Dream&quot;, &quot;Little Rootie Tootie&quot;, &quot;Trinkle Tinkle&quot;, etc. And the definite highlight is &quot;Blue Monk&quot;, Monk's unforgettable blues (duh), where he gets to stretch out over 8 minutes with Blakey egging him on. Monk is often described as a &quot;difficult&quot; pianist due to his angular playing, but listeners often identify with his quirky-yet-catchy tunes and wry sense of humor. This (along with Volumes 1 and 2 of the Genius of Modern Music series on Blue Note) is the perfect introduction to the man and his music, as well as to jazz piano in general.

In 1963, the Kelly/Chambers/Cobb rhythm section packed up and left, leaving Miles Davis without a band. Despite being at an age when most musicians would rather sit on their laurels and play on some giants of jazz tour, he decided to assemble a new working band. This CD shows that assembly in progress. The three ballads were recorded in LA with George Coleman (tenor sax), Victor Feldman (piano), Ron Carter (bass), and Frank Butler (drums). "Basin Street Blues" is very different from Louis Armstrong's version -- Davis's trumpet playing is much sadder, merging abstraction and the blues. The ballads are lovely, but the real treasures in the set are the three tunes recorded one month later with Carter, Coleman, and two younger musicians: pianist Herbie Hancock and drumming prodigy Tony Williams. Williams, only 17 years old here, generates an incredible level of excitement on "Joshua" and the title track. These may be the most exciting up-tempo tracks Davis had recorded since "Two Bass Hit" and "Straight, No Chaser".While most of the excitement surrounds the brilliant young rhythm section, George Coleman's playing here is outstanding. While I am a huge Wayne Shorter fan, dismissing Coleman would be a huge oversight. The quintet with Coleman, Hancock, Carter and Williams would soon evolve into one of the trumpeter's greatest groups, and this is where they got started.The two bonus tracks are a mixed bag. "Summer Night" is a beautiful ballad performance, but the alternate "So Near So Far" is from the LA session with Feldman and doesn't even come close to the one recorded with Hancock/Carter/Williams.

1953 wasn't a good time for Miles Davis -- he was still in the throes of a heroin addiction, making steady work hard to find. Nevertheless this is a welcome Rudy Van Gelder remaster of a recording from the most overlooked period of the trumpeter's career. Miles is joined by some fine company: Jimmy Heath on tenor, J. J. Johnson on trombone, Gil Coggins on piano, Percy Heath on bass, and Art Blakey on drums. The style is mostly bop, plus two ballads that hint at Davis's future mastery in this setting. Miles's playing, which was often erratic in the early 50s, is strong throughout; he sounds confident on the more up-tempo tunes and his balladeering on &quot;I Waited for You&quot; is wonderful. This is not the best place to start a Miles Davis collection (I'd recommend at least 20 other CDs before this one), but if you're looking to explore the period between Birth of the Cool and Walkin' then you might as well dive in here. If you like this album, be sure to check out the RVG master of Volume 1. And if none of this appeals to you, buy it just to hear Blakey's monster drumming on the master take of &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;!

This album contains two sessions: the first 9 tracks are from 1952 (during Miles's heroin addiction), while the next 6 were recorded in early 1954 (his first session after kicking heroin). The song selection is interesting because it contains embryonic versions of several tunes that Miles would record more effectively later in the decade: &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot;, &quot;Woody'n'You&quot;, &quot;Well You Needn't&quot;, &quot;Weirdo&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Sid's Ahead&quot;), and &quot;It Never Entered My Mind&quot;. The '52 session is alright; J.J. Johnson's trombone playing is good throughout but Miles and altoist Jackie McLean are really erratic. The '54 session (with Horace Silver, Percy Heath and Art Blakey) is much stronger -- Miles plays strongly on trumpet and you can't argue with his choice of sidemen. It's not on the level of other recordings he made later that year (Walkin', Bags Groove, the Modern Jazz Giants) but is a welcome addition to any Miles fan's collection. Volume 1 isn't as good as Volume 2, but hardcore Miles fanatics should probably pick up both.

After Mr. Gone, Weather Report consolidated into its most popular lineup -- Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius and Peter Erskine. The quartet was a more chops-oriented lineup than earlier Weather Report lineups, a trait apparent on this live recording from the 1979 tour. They play professional and virtuosic takes on the band's favorites (&quot;A Remark You Made&quot;, &quot;Teen Town&quot;, and a shuffle-beat &quot;Birdland&quot;) that don't really add much to the album versions. There's also a synth-laden version of &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, an unaccompanied Shorter saxophone solo (&quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;), and a technically impressive but slightly boring bass solo from Jaco. The real highlights of this album are in an extended version of &quot;Black Market&quot; (featuring a Shorter-Erskine duet) and the &quot;Badia&quot;/&quot;Boogie Woogie Waltz&quot; medley, which brings back a hint of Weather Report's earlier, freewheeling days. Overall this concert has a scripted, slick feel that contrasts with the far superior Live in Tokyo. The four studio pieces tacked on at the end are forgettable with the exception of Shorter's fiery &quot;Sightseeing&quot; -- who'd thought he'd go back to 60s post-bop with the seminal fusion band of the 70s? This album will disappoint fans of the band's early-mid 70s music, but those who really like Heavy Weather and Black Market will certainly find a lot to like here.

There's a lot of things I like hearing in jazz -- improvisation that takes chances or goes a little &quot;out&quot;, memorable compositions and melodies, a great sense of groove, ballads (&quot;Shifting Sands&quot;), fast swingers (&quot;Cosmosis&quot;), complex interplay between great musicians, unpredictability, high energy, a mix of the earthy and the cerebral -- the list goes on and on. The great thing about Not for Nothin' (and its equally great predecessor, Prime Directive) is that in under 75 minutes, it covers all these bases. This is a group that's not afraid to venture into semi-free territory and then mix it with some of the catchiest, most upbeat tunes since Weather Report; that can toss in funk, Afro-Latin and rock rhythms while swinging all the way and never sounding stiff. Billy Kilson will be the first guy you'll notice, as his drumming is really outstanding. Robin Eubanks (trombone) and Chris Potter (saxophones) make a great frontline, whether they are soloing individually or engaged in a boisterous dialogue. Steve Nelson, on marimba and vibes, is a sort of antithesis to the other guys, always calming down the music. And of course, Dave Holland provides the backbone as well as 5 of the killer compositions on this album. Eubanks's grooving &quot;Global Citizen&quot; is a personal favorite, as is Holland's slightly sinister &quot;What Goes Around&quot; and Nelson's dreamy &quot;Go Fly a Kite&quot;. The music never ceases to surprise me. An addictive album by one of the best groups around today.

This is the companion set to The Water Is Wide and was recorded at the same sessions; Lloyd dedicated it to session participant Billy Higgins after the drummer passed away in May 2001. Hyperion focuses on lengthier pieces, allowing plenty of blowing space for the members of the group. John Abercrombie, who popped up sporadically on the Water Is Wide, plays a lot here. Lloyd's companions certainly rise to the occasion (especially Mehldau), but the saxophonist himself is somewhat disappointing. For whatever reason, his playing here sounds really thin and weak (compare it to the richness on Canto or Voice in the Night).Nevertheless, there is some really gorgeous, inward-looking music here (especially the first two tunes) and fans of Lloyd's other ECM albums will definitely enjoy it.

When Miles Davis formed his classic 1st Quintet, he negotiated a record deal with Columbia records. Before he could release anything through Columbia, however, he had to fulfill recording obligations for the indie label Prestige. In two marathon sessions (May and October '56), the Quintet recorded enough material for four albums: Cookin', Relaxin', Workin' and Steamin'. Cookin' was the first to be released and despite its brief running time (33 minutes), features the strongest material and the best song selection. The two bop tunes, two blues and one ballad provide a balance that isn't really present on the other three albums. "My Funny Valentine" is a quintessential Davis ballad performance, with the mute trumpet and gently swinging rhythm section. "Airegin" and "Tune Up", on the other hand, feature the Quintet at its tightest and most intense - none of the other bop tunes from these sessions come close. Aside from the live material included on the deluxe version of 'Round About Midnight, Cookin' and the other 3 albums from these sessions may be the best taste of what this great group sounded like in person.[This review is based on the K2 20-bit version, which has excellent sound. Both have the same tracklist.]

Filles de Kilimanjaro has an odd pedigree for an &quot;album&quot; -- it was recorded in two different sessions, featuring two different lineups. As a result, in their box-set-everything-Miles-recorded campaign, Sony/Legacy split this album across two boxed sets. That's really unfortunate, because these recordings really work well together, and as an ALBUM this is one of the highest peaks in Miles Davis's career.The three middle tracks (&quot;Tout de Suite&quot;, &quot;Petit Machins&quot;, &quot;Filles de Kilimanjaro&quot;) were the last recordings of the 2nd Quintet with Ron Carter and Herbie Hancock. These five musicians played great on nearly all their recordings, but here they are really incredible. And the MVP has to be Tony Williams, who supplies the music with lots of extra juice. &quot;Tout&quot; combines mellow, Gil Evans arranged outer sections with an explosive rock middle section; Miles and Wayne play off the fireworks of Tony's drumming. &quot;Petit Machins&quot; is the most conventional melody here, but the improvisation afterward is open-ended. The title track has a gorgeous, dreamy melody a la &quot;Footprints&quot; or &quot;Masqualero&quot;.&quot;Frelon Brun&quot; and &quot;Mademoiselle Mabry&quot; were recorded three months later with Chick Corea and Dave Holland replacing Herbie and Ron. &quot;Frelon Brun&quot; is surely one of the best boogaloos ever recorded: intense solos by Wayne and Miles, Chick's spiky comping behind them, and Tony Williams going completely crazy underneath. &quot;Mademoiselle Mabry&quot;, on the other hand, initially seems like a bunch of languid, bluesy phrases (including a nod to Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Wind Cries Mary&quot;) played by Chick and Dave under Miles's statement of the melody. But eventually you realize that these phrases form the frame of the song, repeated over and over while Miles, Wayne and Chick paint beautiful, unhurried solo statements over it. Tony doesn't &quot;drum&quot; here, instead commenting irregularly but respectfully when the music merits it. And then the tune ends just like it started, with Miles playing the melody.This is a major masterwork, a collection of five magical experiences captured in the studio. It's an album that maintains jazz's approach to improvisation, but fuses it with electric piano and rock and soul grooves in a way that's rarely been done since. Miles moved in the rock and soul direction more decisively with In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both wonderful albums) but unfortunately never explored the peaks of Kilimanjaro again.One final note: this &quot;deluxe&quot; edition contains an interesting alternate take of &quot;Tout de Suite&quot; that maintains the original groove throughout.

There have been so many reissues of Coltrane's music, in so many versions, that it's worth knowing which you are buying. Currently there are actually two versions of "Impressions" on the market. In addition, the music on "Impressions" is also available on other currently available discs. If you're a Coltrane completist, you can probably save money by skipping this disc and assembling it from other purchases. If you're the kind of person who will stop at 10 or 12 Coltrane discs, you probably want to pick this one.First, there is the 2008 reissue of "Impressions" on the Verve/Impulse originals series - it's just a straight up reissue of the original 1963 LP. The bulk of the album comes from two tracks off Coltrane's legendary and controversial 1961 Village Vanguard engagement. This is great, boundary pushing music - whether the exotic soprano saxophone stylings of "India" (featuring Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet) or the intense trio playing of "Impressions". If you want to skip buying "Impressions" (the album), you can get these tunes either on the 1 disc set "The Village Vanguard Master Takes" or the 4 CD Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings box set.There are also two studio recordings on the 2008 reissue. "After the Rain" is an absolute classic - a must for even the most casual Coltrane fan. It's a beautiful ballad in the "late Coltrane" style, with a gentle yearning melody and a floating rhythm. If skipping "Impressions", you can get it on the "Dear Old Stockholm" compilation."Up Against the Wall" is a very brief but intense blues, performed without piano. Coltrane was great at this sort of thing, and while it's not the best example of his playing in the genre, but it's very good and if you like this kind of thing I would definitely want to hear it. It's available on the 1997 reissue of Coltrane, but NOT on the 2008 Verve Originals reissue. (Confusing, I know.)The 2000 reissue of "Impressions" includes all of the above, plus the bonus track "Dear Old Stockholm". This is a nice performance, but it's nowhere near as good as the version Coltrane recorded with Miles in 1956. I would call it inessential, but if you do want to hear it, you can either get it on this reissue or on the compilation "Dear Old Stockholm" (which also includes "After the Rain").Overall the music here is essential and it's a very strong album, but you don't need to buy this album if you already own "Dear Old Stockholm", "Coltrane" (version with bonus tracks) and one of the two Vanguard releases mentioned above.

After John Coltrane's death, the members of his last group started recording under their own name. While the cosmic jazz of Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane's albums is clearly under the spell of J.C., it's much tamer (and to many, more digestible) than the uncompromising intensity of Interstellar Space or Live in Japan.Rashied Ali chose not to go that route. Instead, this album continues where the '66-'67 Coltrane group left off and provides over 40 minutes of intense free jazz. Fred Simmons's piano playing has that same unsettled feeling that Alice Coltrane provided, while Carlos Ward's intense improvisations on alto and flute are evocative of the master. Rashied Ali's drumming is magnificent, providing every bit of the "multidirectional pulse" that he showcased on Interstellar Space.This CD is highly recommended to any fan of John Coltrane's last recordings. Be aware that there are lengthy bass and drum solos, and that the sound quality is mediocre.

It seems to me that Blue Note put the more challenging music of the Golden Circle engagement on Volume 2. (Which is still far more accessible than, say, Cecil Taylor's Unit Structures or John Coltrane's Meditations -- don't be frightened away!) &quot;The Riddle&quot; is a frantic freebopper with some of Ornette's best playing on these recordings and &quot;Morning Song&quot; is a dark, beautiful ballad. &quot;Antiques&quot; is a nice, medium tempo exploration with Moffett's occasional martial beats. And while all three of those tracks feature Ornette on alto, &quot;Snowflakes and Sunshine&quot; showcases his trumpet and violin playing. His trumpet playing is primitive and his violin playing is sub-primitive, which may disgust some listeners. But even if you don't like that track, there's still more than an hour of phenomenal saxophone playing here.The new RVG reissue has great sound and almost doubles the playing time of the original with alternate tracks of &quot;Morning Song&quot;, &quot;The Riddle&quot;, and &quot;Antiques&quot;. &quot;Doughnuts&quot;, the previously unreleased track, is actually on the more accessible Volume One. Both Volumes are among the high points of 60s avant-garde jazz.

Like the live version of A Love Supreme released a few years back from Impulse, the four 1965 Half Note broadcasts have circulated among fans in bootleg form for a long time. They come from the period after A Love Supreme, when Coltrane's music evolved rapidly and pushed the Classic Quartet concept to its limit, until it broke. I think they are essential listening, particularly to those open to Coltrane's more experimental side - though they are tame in comparison to works like Ascension and Meditations.I see a few criticisms in the other reviews, most of which I think are misplaced:1) The sound - yeah, it's not perfect, but I think it's pretty good. If you're used to pristine RVG productions, this might bother you. If you can handle a bit of roughness, then you won't have any problem here. It's certainly a lot better than the Coltrane+Monk Five Spot release or the 1967 Olatunji Center recording.2) The incomplete takes - Very unfortunate. It is what it is; the Half Note broadcasts were limited to 45 minutes or so. The music that's here is great, and I don't think the incomplete performances negate that in any way.3) "McCoy and Elvin are lost" - This is something that's repeated a lot and I completely disagree. I hear a group that's super-tight and totally on-board with their leader's concept. They'd been playing together for five years! McCoy Tyner does drop out on "One Down One Up", but that was a fairly routine thing on those tunes that featured Trane-Elvin duets (check out most live versions of "Impressions" and "Mr. P.C." from 1963). When McCoy does solo - on "My Favorite Things", "Afro Blue" and "Song of Praise", he sounds great.If you like Transitions, Living Space, Sun Ship or the live version of A Love Supreme then get this ASAP. My only beef is that Impulse didn't include the other 2 Half Note broadcast - there's one performance here, "Creation", that tops even "One Down One Up" in terms of sheer intensity.

Those were Horace Silver's words describing the horn section of the 1st edition of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Kenny Dorham and Hank Mobley weren't the flashiest players, and they were overlooked in the era of Miles and Clifford and Sonny and Trane. But they were also gifted improvisers and composers, as the Bohemia recordings clearly show. Kenny was more boppish than Miles but definitely a middle-register trumpeter; while Hank had a mellow, soulful sound perfect for hard bop. Add the tireless drums of Blakey and the blues-drenched piano of Horace Silver, and you've got a winning combo. This is the same lineup that recorded the classic album Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers about a year earlier; but there aren't any Silver compositions on either volume of the Bohemia recordings.Volume 2 focuses primarily on Hank Mobley's contributions. &quot;Sportin' Crowd&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Tenor Madness&quot; of Rollins-Coltrane fame) swings hard, while &quot;Avila &amp; Tequila&quot; is an intense Afro-Latin romp that ranks among his best compositions. As far as standards go, &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot; has that great groovy feel that Blakey and his bands perfected. If you like this CD, get Volume 1 as well as Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers (also on Blue Note).

This album is the best-known of the dozen or so recorded by Keith Jarrett's American Quartet, probably due to the fact that it appears on the same label as his most popular work (ECM). Though the group was often supplemented by one or two percussionists, only the group's core of Jarrett, Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian appears here. It was recorded near the end of the group's 6 year life, and is arguably the last great album the group recorded. (They'd go on to record Bop Be and Byablue for Impulse, and the disappointing Eyes of the Heart for ECM.)It's also, without a doubt, the most compositionally ambitious and dense album Jarrett made with this lineup. It's different in tone than their other albums -- there isn't too much of the free-wheeling looseness, funky gospel roots, vibrant swing, or general sense of fun that characterizes those recordings. Other elements of the group's sound appear here -- cascading rubato ballads (two of them on "Beginning"), the world-music-flavored collective improvisation that opens the album, free jazz (the first few minutes of "Conclusion"), and interplay between Redman's tenor and Jarrett's soprano saxophones. The suite even recycles a theme from an earlier album ("Great Bird", from Death and the Flower), though it's given a very different reading here. These elements might surprise someone who comes in expecting the Jarrett of the European Quartet, the Standards Trio or the marathon solo concerts.As far as the performances, Dewey Redman is superb here. He gets four or five excellent solos, and his intense wailing over the rumbling rhythm section in the last few minutes is my favorite part of the album. Listening to his playing here reminds me what a great saxophonist he is -- Amazon's description of the "Texas-blues yearning that's as wide and long as the Lone Star state" is perfect. I think Jarrett has better performances on piano elsewhere, and with one small exception the Haden-Motian tandem never manages to cut loose like they do on other albums. Also, very annoyingly, Jarrett overdubbed a breathy bass recorder bit all over the album.I don't think this is the group's best album -- it doesn't reach the peaks of their best work on Impulse, and I'd personally rather listen to Fort Yawuh, Mysteries or Backhand. (For a bite-sized sample of the Impulse work, check out Fort Yawuh. Otherwise spring for the two box sets that include all the group's work.) On the other hand, if you like Jarrett's more "serious" work on ECM then you might actually prefer the Survivor's Suite. Either way, it's definitely worth picking up and enjoying.

The "late night music" album has a pretty long tradition in jazz - the kind of introspective music that you hear as you sit alone nursing your drink at the bar during last call, or maybe looking out the window on a rainy night. Blue Note released several such albums and Blue Hour is one of them. But it's not the best.I have no real beef with Stanley's soulful and bluesy playing on this one, though I've heard better playing from him. The rhythm section leaves something to be desired; they're lightly bluesy and funky, but sound a little stiff and predictable to my ears. Combine that with a fairly narrow range of material (especially on the original album) and you get an album, that while not monotonous, has a certain sameness that keeps it from being a classic. Just listen to the first tracks back to back - despite being different tunes, they sound almost exactly the same. It's nice music, but compare it to Ben Webster with Oscar Peterson or Kenny Burrell's Midnight Blue (also with Stanley) and you can definitely hear the difference.I'd recommend some of Stanley's other albums over this one - Up at Minton's, That's Where It's At, Joyride, The Spoiler. If you really want a "late night" album without some of the more crossover-oriented soul jazz of Turrentine's later work, though, you might want this one instead.

Somewhat oddly, Brilliant Corners seems to be really popular here at Amazon while Monk's Music languishes in relative obscurity. That's too bad, because these albums are like twins -- the first albums consisting of primarily Monk compositions to hit it big with the jazz public.Like Brilliant Corners, Monk's Music includes some older Monk tunes which, because of his earlier obscurity, were often new to the public. "Epistrophy", "Ruby, My Dear", "Off Minor" and "Well You Needn't" were all recorded by Monk in the late 40s on Blue Note records. But because the LP didn't exist in the 40s, all those recordings were pretty short -- 4 minutes, tops -- and didn't really let the musicians stretch out. On this album, they get that chance to stretch. Monk also introduces a new composition: the knotty but beautiful ballad "Crepescule with Nellie".This album is also hyped (deservedly so) for featuring the only recorded meeting of Coleman Hawkins and John Coltrane. Hawkins was the first major tenor saxophonist in jazz, way back in the 20s; Coltrane would be the dominant tenor of the 60s. Hawkins had hired Monk back in the 40s, when the language of bebop was still strange to many listeners and musicians; Coltrane would soon be hired by Monk for their fabled engagement at the Five Spot. Anyway, it's terrific to hear both the emerging giant and the mature master tackle Monk's music.I guess I shouldn't sell the other personnel short either. Ray Copeland (trumpet) and Gigi Gryce (alto sax) round out the front line. Wilbur Ware would be Monk's bassist for the Five spot gigs. And Art Blakey, who is in my mind the perfect accompanist for Monk, plays drums.This is one of my favorite Monk recordings on the Riverside label, and I predict that it will probably be yours too. Along with Brilliant Corners and Monk & Coltrane, it is a great introduction to Thelonious Sphere Monk. You might want to look for the slightly more expensive 20-bit remastered version, which probably sounds better than the original 80s CD issue.

I must emphatically disagree with the other reviewer -- this is a recording of one of Miles's best live groups, the so-called "Lost Quintet" with Davis, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland and Jack DeJohnette. There are hints of the rockish directions Davis was concurrently pursuing in the studio on tunes like "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down" and "It's About That Time", but notwithstanding Chick's electric piano this group picks up where Davis's 2nd Great Quintet (w/Herbie, Ron, and Tony) left off. The music frequently crosses the line between challenging post-bop and cerebral avant-garde explorations. "Footprints" in particular gets an exhiliratingly free ride, and even the two rock-influenced tracks wander outside as soon as Davis finishes soloing.The trumpet playing on this CD is often explosive and aggressive, with Davis at the peak of his trumpet-playing chops. Wayne Shorter plays both soprano and tenor, and provides some of the most powerful, avant-garde playing of his career. And this rhythm section, fully engaged in the collective improvisation mentality of the 60s "New Thing" but also willing to swing hard or get funky, is arguably the best that Davis ever had.This disc includes some of the final recordings of "Milestones" and "'Round Midnight" (the latter begins with a beautiful Davis-Corea duet but accelerates to a torrid pace for Wayne and Chick's solos). There's also an outstanding interpretation of Joe Zawinul's explosive "Directions", which was Davis's set-opener from 1969 to 1971 and essentially tracked the evolution of his music over that time span. (Given the nature of the music at this concert, this version is much freer than those on the better-known recordings from 1970.)Unfortunately, this recording doesn't seem to be available domestically in the US, but it's worth looking hard for any of Davis's live European recordings from 1969 (most are "unofficial"). Hopefully Sony will issue them here soon. Until then, you might have to console yourself with the March 1970 recording from the Fillmore East (It's About That Time), which is more "rock" and less "free" than this one but still gives a taste of what this great band could do. Whether you view the Lost Quintet as the end of the progression that Davis began on Seven Steps to Heaven (the last quintet), or the beginning of the evolution that would lead Davis to Agharta and Pangaea (the first electric band), this concert from July 1969 is truly essential and groundbreaking music.

The last two or three albums with Jaco Pastorius and Peter Erskine sounded like a group on musical autopilot. And while some fans of the Pastorius/Erskine band may sneer at their replacements (Victor Bailey and Omar Hakim, respectively), 1983's Procession was definitely a comeback. The tunes are more catchy (especially the classic title track), the band is more feisty, and Zawinul's synths are less cheesy than they had been in years. There's an obvious nostalgia for the Mysterious Traveller - Black Market days (just look at the cover!) on songs like the Shorter/Zawinul duet &quot;The Well&quot; and the memorable Shorter ballad &quot;Plaza Real&quot;. This is not a classic by any means, but people looking to explore the post-Heavy Weather albums of WR should definitely start here.

After five tenor-plus-rhythm recordings on ECM, Charles Lloyd decided to shift gears and look back to his musical roots. One of his first major gigs was the musical directorship of Chico Hamilton's innovative post-bop group, playing side by side with Hungarian guitarist Gabor Szabo. That group (represented on albums like A Different Journey and The Man from Two Worlds) debuted several of the pieces which appear on this album -- &quot;Voice in the Night&quot;, various shorter pieces in the &quot;Pocket Full of Blues&quot; medley, and the perennial &quot;Forest Flower&quot;.The personnel is also quite different than the earlier ECM albums, which usually included European rhythm section members and drummer Billy Hart. Lloyd drafts his old LA buddy Billy Higgins on drums, then completes the piano-less rhythm section with guitarist John Abercrombie and bassist Dave Holland. There's little of the chamber-music flavor, world music exoticism or Coltrane-ish moodyness that pervades the earlier albums.Instead, we get a surprisingly straight-ahead album by ECM standards. You can hear reflections of the Hamilton-Szabo group matured by age and experience. Lloyd's tenor is as robust and powerful as on Canto or All My Relations, with a greater nod to his Memphis roots. His ballad performances are beautiful and often profound (especially the title track and Strayhorn's &quot;A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing&quot;) but without the occasional meditative stillness that crept in a few years before. On the more up-tempo tracks his cheeky wit frequently pops up; check out how he plays with the rhythm section on the blues medley. And the take on &quot;Forest Flower&quot; is one of the best of his career, light and loosely swinging.This is one of the best Lloyd albums on ECM, second only to Canto and maybe All My Relations. Like All My Relations, it contains a greater variety of tempos than much of his ECM work, and an excellent collection of compositions to boot. If you want to hear what Lloyd's been up to since emerging from retirement in the 80s, this is one of the places to start.

Picking up a 50s Horace Silver album on Blue Note records is definitely a no-risk proposition, but there are better places to start than Six Pieces of Silver. The best of the seven pieces on the original album are &quot;Enchantment&quot; (great soul jazz) and the rumbling, slightly ominous &quot;Senor Blues&quot;. Most of the other pieces are typical catchy, grooving Silver if not as exceptional as those on Blowin' the Blues Away or Horace Silver &amp; the Jazz Messengers. (So get those two albums first.) As an added note, the sound is really murky on the Rudy Van Gelder edition.

Mother Ship isn't an overwhelming classic the way Unity was, but it does share something in common with the earlier album. It has great compositions, a strong ensemble, and convincing performances. Herbert Morgan plays MUCH better than on Of Love and Peace, and Lee Morgan was experiencing another creative rebirth during this period. Larry's playing is clearly much further along than it was on Unity, pushing toward the freedom that would characterize his playing on Lifetime. (Fortunately, he is much better recorded here than he would be on Emergency! or Turn It Over.) The ensemble is not super-tight, and there are occasional mild flubs, but the overall feeling is of players in tune with each other. There are also some forward-looking jazz-rock grooves.I find it difficult to imagine that any serious Larry Young fan would dislike this album. Out of the 4 Larry Young Blue Note albums I've heard, this is my second favorite.

Aside from the first two seasons, #7 is the weakest in TNG's run. In many ways it recalls the second season - flashes of brilliance switching with lengthy swaths of mediocrity (concentrated primarily in the season's second half).That said, there are a few outright classics here - "The Pegasus" is among the best episodes TNG ever did, and "All Good Things..." is a wonderful, affectionate tribute to the series. "Lower Decks" and "Gambit" are also really good. It's the stretch from "Thine Own Self" to "Emergence" that unfortunately drags - ironically, TNG's "kid brother" DS9 was finally hitting its stride during the same period.Normally I don't comment on the extras - they are of marginal interest to anyone except hardcore fans - but this set has some nice farewells and reminiscences from Patrick Stewart as well as other participants in the show's creation.Verdict: if you've made it this far, you'll want to watch these episodes, but if you're tight on cash I'd rent rather than buy.

Season six was the last great season of Next Generation; seven was just too uneven and lackluster, as the writers moved onto Voyager and Generations.Six resembles five in many ways; a number of classic episodes, plenty of good ones, and also a fair share of mediocrity. "Change of Command" and "Tapestry" are absolutely brilliant and worthy of mention as among the best in TNG's run. We also get "Frame of Mind", "The Chase", "Ship in a Bottle", "Starship Mine", "Face of the Enemy" and "Timescape". On the minus side of the ledger, there are plenty of episodes like "The Quality of Life", "Realm of Fear", "Birthright", and "Aquiel" - all with the common denominator of boredom.Worth it for most Trek fans. All good things...

The core of Next Generation - the period that makes most fans sigh with nostalgia - surely has to be seasons 3 through 6. The first two seasons were full of growing pains, while the seventh was somewhat underwhelming due to producers and writers shifting their focus elsewhere.Season 3 is generally remembered for three fan favorite episodes - "Deja Q", "Yesterday's Enterprise" and part 1 of "The Best of Both Worlds." But I think what is remarkable is that there are almost no bad episodes - the only read duds are "The Price" and "Menage a Troi". Instead, you get a mix that's split about 50-50 between episodes that you'd characterize as very good or better, and episodes that are solid, watchable but unremarkable. That's different from season 5, where the quality dispersion is much wider.Besides the fan favorites, there are two remarkable episodes I would like to single out as personal favorites - the classic military thriller "The Defector" and the wonderful "The Offspring". I would put those up against any other episode in the series.The series would peak with season 4, but this one is not that far behind.

Most fans agree that season 4 was TNG's best - not because it had the most classic episodes, but because the show was consistently good, with relatively few duds. Even the duds were generally mediocre rather than terrible - something you couldn't say for the 3 seasons that followed.There are some classic episodes on this set, a few of which don't end up on most fan favorite lists - "The Drumhead" (in my personal top 5), "The Wounded", "Family", "The Mind's Eye" and "Data's Day". The conclusion to season 3's cliffhanger "The Best of Both Worlds" is great, if not at the level of part 1; "Redemption Part 1" closes the season on a very strong note.While later seasons had their share of great and even classic episodes, some of the focus dissipated and each was peppered with some clunkers. Here, that's not a problem. Even casual fans are likely to want this 7 DVD collection.

In 1957 John Coltrane recorded his first masterpiece, Blue Train; in 1967, he recorded his last masterpiece, Interstellar Space. Within 5 months of recording these duets with drummer Rashied Ali, he would die of liver cancer.Though it gets lumped with other &quot;late&quot;, post-1965 or avant-garde Coltrane recordings, this album sounds very little like any other Trane recording. Even if you dislike Meditations or Ascension, there's a chance that you'll like this -- and vice versa. The absence of Pharoah Sanders makes this record easier on the ears, and a lot less ferocious. On the other hand people who love the hardcore intensity of stuff like Meditations or Sun Ship may find Interstellar Space to be a little too abstract or austere. The absence of piano creates a lot of space, which may be a good or a bad thing depending on your tastes.There are still some similarities to Meditations, Sun Ship, etc. -- Coltrane's playing is very free, disregarding harmony and melody for sound. The themes are short and range from serene beauty (&quot;Venus&quot;) to dense fury (&quot;Leo&quot;). Though it might seem that this music is random or without structure, the order and structure are just in a different musical language. In some parts, Coltrane is conducting a saxophone dialogue with himself.I'm a fan of course, and must say that the music is unbelievable. If you're a fan of Trane's saxophone playing, keep in mind that he just PLAYS on this album, with none of his abilities impaired in the least. Rashied Ali is obviously not Elvin Jones, but he complements Trane perfectly and fuels his ideas. As long as you know what you are getting into, this should be one of the first purchases if you want to explore Coltrane's late music. And though very little of his other work sounds like it, the quartet sessions composing Stellar Regions and Expression come from the same time period.

John Coltrane recorded so frequently for the Prestige label during '56-'58 that it's tough to figure out where to start. This May 1957 recording, coming just after his departure from the Miles Davis Quintet, is a pretty good initiation; it doesn't reach the heights of Blue Train (the indisputable classic from Trane's early period, recorded for Blue Note) but is still a great session of hard bop with plenty of Coltrane's powerful, intense playing. The album's peaks are two ballads ("Violets for Your Furs", "While My Lady Sleeps" -- Coltrane was already an incredible ballad player by this time) and the tense "Bakai". The other tracks are all prime hard bop. My only real complaint is about the rest of the players: the rhythm section (Mal Waldron and Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, Al Heath on drums) is excellent, but Johnny Splawn (trumpet) and Sahib Shihab (baritone sax) pale in comparison to some of the other horn players Coltrane recorded with around this time. Nevertheless, First Trane is a great purchase for any Coltrane fan; the 20 bit remaster by Fantasy has crystal clear sound. One final note: this album is actually titled "Coltrane" on the CD. There's another (excellent) album of the same name which John Coltrane recorded in 1962 for the Impulse! label in a very different style. Be aware which one you are buying.[This review is based on the K2 20-bit remaster, which if other comparisons offer any guide, has superior sound quality to the OJC version issued in 1991.]

In 1957, eccentric piano genius Thelonious Monk was on the verge of breaking into the jazz mainstream. He formed a quartet featuring tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, another musician who was no stranger to controversy. Their legendary collaboration (and gigs at the Five Spot Cafe) only lasted a few months, but the few recordings that it produced are classic. This studio CD (recently remastered in clear 20-bit sound) contains three great tunes by the Monk Quartet, two &quot;leftovers&quot; from the octet session (with Art Blakey and Coleman Hawkins) that produced _Monk's Music_, and a solo piano feature. All the tunes mix Monkish angularity with catchy melodies as only Monk could write them. It's hard to pick a favorite on an album this good, but if I have to: &quot;Trinkle, Tinkle&quot; really stands out for both Monk and Trane's playing (you can hear some of the earliest traces of his &quot;sheets of sound&quot;) and Monk's unaccompanied playing on &quot;Functional&quot; is outstanding. But that's not to say that the tender playing on &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot;, or the octet versions of &quot;Epistrophy&quot; and &quot;Off Minor&quot; aren't fantastic in their own right. If you like this album, you must pick up the lower-fidelity recording of the band live at the Five Spot, as well as the aforementioned _Monk's Music_ album.

Joe Henderson was a great saxophonist, but I don't think I'll ruffle many feathers by calling this one of his lesser 60s efforts. Compare it to his 5 excellent albums on Blue Note, or for that matter McCoy Tyner's The Real McCoy (recorded around the same time) and you'll get a good sense of what I mean. Almost everything here - Joe's playing, the rhythm section, the compositions - has a better representative elsewhere. For example, Joe's playing here is good (was it ever bad during this period?) but certainly not at his best, and he's constrained by having to share solo space and relatively short track playing times. It's nice to hear him tackling 4 standards, but the 4 compositions by Joe were played better in their original Blue Note incarnations. And while Louis Hayes and Kenny Barron are great musicians, they don't hold a candle (at least here) to the intense fury of McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones on Inner Urge and The Real McCoy.You're better off picking up almost all of Joe's Blue Note recordings (as a leader and sideman) before this one. If you're interested in checking out the Milestone years there are plenty of other places to start, such as the brilliant Power to the People or Joe Henderson in Japan. This may have been viewed by Orrin Keepnews and Joe as a good way to reintroduce the saxophonist to the jazz public, but fortunately they didn't repeat the formula on later albums for the label.

Chick Corea has taken some serious flack for artistic decisions he made in the 70s -- plenty of it is deserved. But before forming the first Return to Forever, he played challenging, uncompromising jazz that floated somewhere between post-bop, jazz-rock and free improvisation.These two CDs, recorded in May of 1969, shouldn't be listened to in one sitting. Some of this stuff works and some of it doesn't, but in reasonable doses (say, 30-40 minutes), it's a fun ride. Chick's companions are his buddies from the Davis group (Jack DeJohnette and Dave Holland), trumpeter Woody Shaw, flautist Hubert Laws, drummer Horace Arnold, and tenor saxophonist Bennie Maupin. Different permutations of the lineup play on each track.The tracks run all over the place. &quot;It&quot; is a wonderful 30 second duet between Corea (on acoustic piano) and Laws; &quot;Is&quot; is a 30 minute collective improvisation that drifts unpredictably between energy and boredom. The best tracks are &quot;The Brain&quot; and &quot;This&quot; -- explosive post-bop with ear-opening solos by Corea (on both acoustic and electric) and Maupin. If you're only familiar with Maupin from his bass clarinet noodling on Bitches Brew or his reed playing on the Headhunters recordings, you'll be blown away. He sounds like a very angry Wayne Shorter. &quot;Song of the Wind&quot; is also known as &quot;Waltz for Bill Evans&quot;, while &quot;Jamala&quot; would appear on the classic first album by the Gateway trio.This new reissue has much better sound than most previous issues of this material; only the alternate of &quot;Sundance&quot;, for which no original masters were found, has a poor sound. The sequencing is convenient: disc one contains the (relatively) more accessible material while disc two includes the collective improvisations. Anyway, if you like Circle, the wilder moments of Now He Sings, Now He Sobs or the rhythm sections on Miles's '69-'70 recordings, then you should definitely pick up the Complete Is Sessions.

Out of the albums recorded by the Yusef-enhanced lineup of the Cannonball Adderley group, this one is probably the most popular, largely on the strength of the hit "The Jive Samba". Yet for my money, of the three I've heard, this one ranks firmly behind Cannonball in Europe and Nippon Soul. There's nice music here, but little of the intensity on the other two albums."Jive Samba" has a similar formula to other Cannonball hits - a danceable rhythm and a catchy melody. Its pseudo-bossa-nova groove clearly presages "The Sidewinder" and similar tunes that would populate many hard-bop albums for the rest of the decade. But it also eschews the hard-hitting funk that underpinned tunes like "Work Song" or "Sack'o'Woe". A nice tune but not my favorite on the album.My favorites are the exotic sounding "Primitivo" and "Mellow Buno", which both point the way toward the edgier ground the Cannonball group began to explore around this time. "Primitivo" is a fantastic tune showcasing Yusef Lateef's oboe and flute playing. "Mellow Buno" has an Ellington, Monkish, perhaps even Dolphy-esque, flavor.The rest of the album is nice enough (special mention for the ballad "Lillie" and Sam Jones's "Unit 7"), but not especially remarkable. Unless you're dead set on acquiring the hit first, I would get some other albums by this lineup first.

I think it's fair to say that many CTI albums involved questionable artistic choices - undoubtedly talented artists placed in front of overly lush arrangements playing commercially-compromised material. But that in no way describes Sugar which nothing more and nothing less than small-combo early 70s soul jazz. In some ways it is actually less commercial than some of Stan's late 60s material for Blue Note - there is no crossover pop material, no use of lush backgrounds, and on each tune the musicians get plenty of room to blow. The music grooves at some points and is not afraid to swing in others. There's even the surprise performance of John Coltrane's "Impressions" - obviously not as intense and abstract as Trane's performances, but a nice perspective nonetheless.Ultimately I don't find this to be as compelling as the best of Stanley's material on BN, but I would encourage those wary of CTI's later excesses to put those worries aside and check this out. And as for those who already love this album but haven't check earlier stuff out - how about picking up "The Spoiler", "Joyride", "Hustlin' ", "That's Where It's At" or "Up at Minton's"?
