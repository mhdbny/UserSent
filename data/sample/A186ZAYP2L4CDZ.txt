Agatha keeps pulling me back; I cannot say that each book is better than the last, because that is not always the case, but I find myself wanting to be Agatha's cheerleader.She constantly makes bad choices, but I am not sure that she does it intentionally. She seems to be that person who always fails at doing the right thing. For instance, the in ink is barely dry on her marriage certificate to James Lacey when already the marriage is over. Agatha is just too independent to be married to the demanding James, so when their small community witnesses a very public argument and then James turns up missing with blood on his front doorstep, Agatha is most assuredly the prime suspect. Nevertheless, there is more to this story since James himself seems to have a wandering eye and the town knows about that too.Now it is up to Agatha to find James, prove her innocence, prove that James did not murder the trollop that he was rumored to have been having a not so clandestine affair with and tie it all up in a neat bow so she can move on with her life.I know it sounds like just another day in Agatha's life, but somehow this book is just a little bit different. Agatha comes across as bit more human, a bit less assured and possibly a bit more likeable, even if she does have hard cruel bearlike eyes.As I have said before, you really do have to begin these books at the beginning to get the full Agatha affect. Some are better than others; some leave you wondering what goes on in Agatha's mind, but in the end, she is an endearing character that makes you wonder what she could get up to next.

Of course, I was apprehensive after reading these negative reviews, but I have enjoyed the Miracle-Gro products for years and could not imagine that it would not work right. Then again, I can be quite persistent and if I did not like it, I would return it.Hooked it up to the hose and at first I was not too impressed. There did not seem to be any blue liquid coming out. Then I took another reviewers suggestion and filled the container with water before I started spraying it on the garden. That was the key. Start with a full sprayer and you will get the results you are looking for.Consistent light blue water came out of the sprayer. For my own peace of mind, I did shake the feeder from time to time to make sure that all the fertilizer crystals were making contact with the water. Do not know if this was in the original directions, but it is a good thing to keep in mind.Overall, I enjoyed the ease of use and the overall reliability of this product.

Set in rural New Hampshire, Halfway house tells the story of the Voorster family whose lives are upended when 17-year-old Angie suffers a breakdown and is eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As Angie shuffles between hospitals, dorm rooms, halfway houses and her childhood home, the side effects of her disease and treatment impact each member of her familyNoel is a first time author and has fallen into the trap of trying to fit too much into one book. It's just all overwhelming and I wondered throughout the whole book if the family was already damaged or if the daughter's illness damaged them.The end was too abrupt and just didn't make sense.

This review is based off of the movie, not the paperback. Don't know how I made the mistake of picking the wrong item. Sorry for the inconvenience.Described as a poignant story of forbidden love and the loss of innocence set in England prior to the Second World War, Brideshead Revisited in the movie adaptation of the British television series that has had a strong following for years. I can see why so many were disappointed in the adaptation, because there is no way that all the nuances of an 11 episode series can be boiled down into two hours. With that being said, if you have never seen the series, I highly recommend the movie.From first blush, it is a beautiful story, beautiful locations, beautiful costumes and exceptional acting.Brideshead is not an easy story to tell. Told in a different light than the television version, the plotline tells of a triangular love story with a contemporary resonance. The 1920's and 30's were a different time, the Flyte family was all about class and tribalism and all decisions were made around their beliefs and way of behaving in a rich staunchly Catholic family. This family was raised to keep outsiders out and to keep their own secrets buried deep within one's self.Emma Thompson plays the family matriarch that only shows her children attention through her formal relationship with God. The only time that Julia and Sebastian spent time with her was either during church services, which were held in the family chapel or when they were discussing sins.There is no way that that the children can live up to either their mothers standard or Gods, which leads to both of them having to hide their true selves and show that how a family conditions its children, by indoctrinating their relationship with God in such an austere way, will only result in destruction of their internal soul.Brideshead is a character all its own. You cannot escape its draw. It is the one thing that Charles wanted, more than the people in it, but once there, he could not escape it. What is it about a place that will not let you leave?Told through the eyes Charles you see all the beauty and damage within people and places.A truly fascinating journey of tragic love, strong virtues and damaged people.

Each weekly episode involves an interesting legal quandary, not like Law and Order, more along the interpersonal lines than the legal one, but they do throw in a curious twist. The interaction between characters is interesting, the viewer finds themselves liking the characters that they shouldn't, curious about those with a hidden past, feeling the pain of a jilted lover, smiling at the softness of those with harder edges. Overall, the play among the cast is tantalizing. There is always a story within a story.Whereas in Law and Order you have a bunch of stodgy old judges, The Good Wife has a recurring cast of quirky but fascinating judges that seem to appear with a regularity that makes you glad to see them again. Guest appearances are fun and what is funny, one of my favorite characters is not a regular, yet she should be. Maime Gummer (the daughter of Meryl Streep) plays Nancy Crozier a lovable quirky lawyer that has me wondering if she really is as nave as she pretends or does that woman have brains under all the blonde hair and beauty.If you are not much of a late evening television watcher and have not had a chance to see this program, I highly suggest that you take your time; track down the DVD's of this series and settle in for some great television

I was a bit apprehensive when it came to seeing this movie. I never read past book number 3 due to Bella's incessant whining, so the idea of seeing this movie was hovering somewhere at the bottom of my to-do list.To my relief I enjoyed this film, it was surprisingly funny and the intensity of some of the scenes had you staring slack jawed at the screen. From what I can tell, no extra fluff was included and the story flowed very well from start to finish without me having to constantly ask what was going on. Too many writers and directors assume that the audience is made up of diehard fans and skip too many vital parts, glad to see that this time was different. Well, if parts were skipped that is fine, because what I saw worked.Having not read the book, I had no idea what to expect in this show. Not sure how much to reveal here since any plot points will be a movie giveaway, all I can say is that the special effects people are geniuses. The visuals that they were able to accomplish are stunning and to my utter amazement, the flow was steady and at no time did I check my watch to see how much longer I had to sit there.The end, well, that was perfect. Just enough to make you anticipate the next and final installment of the Twilight series.

Book 1 of the Trilogy. This book takes about 100 pages to get going, but once it does, it's quite good. Tally, an "Ugly", can't wait until her 16th birthday when she will become a "Pretty". That's how it is done now to stop all the name calling and bullying. All children at 16 have a surgery to become beautiful, they all look the same, party together, think the same, and have no cares in the world. That is until she meets Shay an "ugly" that tells her about a place called the Smoke where you can live without having to have the surgery. Where people like you for who you are and how you think. Tally will have to make a decision that may take her way from what she has always wanted.

Second in the Trilogy. Tally becomes a Pretty, but it's not everything that she thought it would be. Somehow she has thought her way out of being Pretty-Minded and is once again out to find the New Smoke to join them, to help them and to live a life outside of the City. She and Zane risk their lives to join up with David only to find out that the Specials have a whole new way to find them. Tally once again betrays and is betrayed. I'm enjoying this series. I'm not much of a science fiction reader, so to me this is Sci-Fi-Lite. This book took a little longer to get going, but the story did move a long. Hopefully book 3 will answer the questions.

2nd in the Far Wychwood Mystery Series. Librarian and former New Yorker Catherine Penny now lives in England after being left by her husband for a younger woman. When Catherine can't avoid him at the awards ceremony honoring their son-in-law, Peter, who is a shoo-in for a prestigious appointment at Oxford's Mercy College She must come to terms with her past and her future. But the shock of Peter not being chosen is matched only by who is: pompous, womanizing scholar Edgar Stone. And when Stone is found murdered, it is up to Catherine to solve the mystery. I love the character of Catherine Penny, she is funny and feisty with just enough curosity to keep the book interesting.

Audio. I have put both this book and Sophie's Choice off for a long time. The subject matter is just to aborhant to me that I truly had a hardtime trying to stomach it and just couldn't force myself to read them. Having said that, I think I let my imagination run away with itself because I wasn't as drawn in by this book as I thought I would be. Maybe because I wouldn't let myself. Maybe because the writing wasn't as gut wrenching at I assumed it would be. Maybe because man's inhumanity to man isn't so "new" or "surprising" anymore.

Mass tort lawyers are the men who win billion-dollar class-action settlements from corporations selling bad products, then rake fantastic fees off the top, with far smaller payouts going to the people harmed by the products. Clay Carter is a burning-out lawyer at the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) in Washington, D.C., when he catches the case of a teen who, for no apparent reason, has gunned down an acquaintance. Clay is approached by a mysterious stranger, who says he represents a megacorporation whose bad drug caused the teen--and others--to kill. Thus begins the life of a tort lawyer. It's been a while since I have read a "great" Grisham, but this one was pretty good.

Though a vivid portrayal of Welch life, I found it hard to fully get into the flow of the language of this book, the middle bogs down, with a bit too much repetition, and some characters are glossed over a little too much for my liking.Llewelyn draws the picture of life for Huw Morgan and the hardscrabble life of his brothers, parents and friends in a very difficult time. Coal mining is what the Morgan family was all about, this was their life, their valley and their existence so when the mining companies make the Morgan family's way of living unbearable, the Morgan boys had no choice but to rise up against the oppression and there goes the beauty that was once their lives.Huw makes this story come alive. Through the eyes of the innocent, then the dawning adolescence and finally the man that has been through love and heartbreak, we see the valley that Huw loved so much. Llwelyn's first person narrative allows us to see each character through Huw's eyes. The eyes that grow with time and with maturity.I can see the charm of this book growing with each reader. There are many layers and with each readers personal experiences each will see this book differently. If you have read it in the past, re-read it again and you will see why this book is a classic.

After leaving his previous job as a minister in a rather glitzy church were being seen is more important then doing good, Sam Kinkade has settled into the town of Toms Brook, VA, the same setting as Richards previous book Wedding Ring. With many of the same characters, the author weaves a new story around the church and their new Sexton, Elisa Martinez, a refugee from Guatemala.Sam and his fellow parishioners have opened up La Casa Amarilla on the grounds of the church to act as an education program for the Hispanic children new to the area. But as the story progresses we see that everyone has a secret, including the pre-Cival War home that houses the school.With precise storytelling, Emilie Richards unwinds a wonderful addition to her Shenandoah Album series that brings the residents of Toms Brook into our homes and makes the reader a wonderful addition to the close knit community that cares for one another in a way that now seems foreign to most of us.

First in the Vineyard Murder series. The editing was a bit choppy, but I think I will most definately give book 2 a try.During his career as a Boston cop, Jeff "JW" Jackson was shot and has decided to retire to the serenity of Martha's Vineyard to spend his days fishing and wooing a nurse named Zee. But when a local's boat mysteriously explodes off the coast, killing a young man, Jackson finds himself reluctantly drawn back into the investigative trade.There are some wrong doings in paradise - and it's contaminating Jackson's lovely peaceful island with its poisonous venom of drugs and death.

Now I am not sure if this series falls under the traditional Cozy genre since there isn't the warm fuzzy feel, but there is a small town, there are cats, and of course a woman on the tail of a killer. But that is where the comparison to cozy ends.After a couple of so-so cozies in my recent past, it was nice to finally get drawn in by a writer that knows how to keep the plot moving forward without relying on clich&eacute;s and cats with above human intelligence.Savannah Reid, is a police detective in the small town of San Carmelita, that is until she steps on one too many toes and finds herself out of a job and still on the trail of a brutal killer. Not having a badge or a police issued weapon doesn't stop her, she has a job to do and with her southern charm and wit she is going to find out who killed Jonathan Winston even if it does take her ex-partner and a rather dashing ex-CIA agent Ryan Stone, who with his partner, John Gibson, add quite a bit of splash to a rather dull life.This first in a series book definitely makes you want to read the rest. If you are a fan of Stephanie Plum you will without a doubt find a new lead character that has you laughing and scratching your head at the same time.

The next time your little darlings wants to travel for Spring Break sit their little tokhes down to watch this movie, then have them write a 5 page report on human trafficking and guaranteed they will not want to leave their rooms until they are 30. You, as a parent, might not sleep for the next 20 years, but certainly, you will see the world from a different more paranoid perspective and will hold on to those little honeys with all your fingers and all your claws.Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills a retired CIA agent that has recently retired and moved to Los Angeles in hopes of building a better relationship with his daughter. Ex-wife and daughter ambush and guilt Bryan into signing the papers that will allow their daughter to leave the country and soon Kim and her friend Amanda are jetting off to Paris only to be befriended by an Albanian gang of human traffickers.The intensity is nonstop and the perils that both Bryan and his daughter have to face leave your heart and stomach somewhere in the middle of your throat.This movie is not for the squeamish. There are brutal fight scenes and the subject matter might be too much for some to handle, but over all, this is a very good movie. Liam Neeson does a remarkable job in portraying both the professionally trained killer and the deeply loving and scared father.This is a movie not to be missed.

Belinda Lawrence has had very little contact with her great aunt, so she was a bit surprised to receive a note requesting that she come by for a visit. Unfortunately, the visit was a bit too late as Belinda discovered her aunts body days dead on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.Though called an accident by the police, Belinda sees things a little differently especially since the letter requesting the visit had been mailed after her aunts supposed accident.With some quirky and other eerie characters, the author weaves a tale that has the reading turning the pages even though you think you have it figured out, you still want to see if Kavanagh was only teasing the reader or if there really was something afoot in this very dark village far away from the city light with overgrown gardens and mystery chambers.

For some reason I thought that this book was going to be more mystery then it actually turned out to be. What started out interesting quickly lost its spark for me when it turned out to be more about Maisie's early life and less about the investigation that she was hired for.Instead of heading off to college as Maisie had planned, this rather inquisitive fourteen year old enters service of Lady. The Lady of the house is rather taken with Maisie's intelligence and arranges for her to be tutored, and with good fortune, Maisie qualifies for Cambridge. Unfortunately, the college cannot keep her interest and within a year, Maisie enters the World War I as a nurse.Somehow, this is where the story jumps, actually the whole book jumps, but the war is over and Maisie is opening up her own private investigation business. She is asked to look into a rather discreet affair that quickly turns into her investigating the goings on at the Retreat, a remote convalescent home has some rather underhanded business dealings that take advantage of the injured returning soldiers.Overall, the story is not bad, just not what I was expecting and with so much back story, the whole thing just lost its initial charm.

Since I did not enjoy the first book in this series, until its very end, I surprised myself by picking up this one and realizing that I enjoyed it quite a bit more.Odd really endeared himself to me in this one. From the beginning with his story about Elvis to the end where he will do what it takes, even if it is his own life, to help a friend. That is what Odd does, and with the help of his loved ones in the town of Pico Mundo, Odd will forever be treasured by his band of friends and the readers of this series.Odd Thomas does not consider himself a hero, he just has the ability to communicate with the dead and has a built in magnet that draws people, whether alive or dead, to him. Odd's a good person so when his childhood friend disappears, Odd uses his ability to find him, not realizing that this journey will take him to an old abandoned casino and the evil Datura, who is determined to use Odd's gifts to further her own wicked goals.The ending leads right into what appears to be the third installment of the Odd Thomas story. That in itself looks very interesting. Just imagine Odd as a Lay member of a religious order with Elvis along, since Elvis knows that this is his way home to his beloved mother.I am glad that this series is starting to grow on me, I had been a fan of Dean Koontz with his original books, and I am glad that I can once again look forward to reading more.

I would call this a coming of age story, but yet the narrator and his friend Luo are already 18 years old when they are sent away from there families as part of the Chinese Re-Education program. This took them away from their families and lives with very little hope of ever seen them again. But that is not what this book was really about for me, it was more a story of hope, of love, of lust, of friendship, of betrayal and how books when you don't have access to them, mean the world to you. They can be your savior and your burden, but you are willing to risk everything for them. How when you have so very little, you can still have a whole world available to you.

This book really missed the mark for me. The overall storyline seemed more disjointed then her past efforts and previously prominent characters barely made and appearance.Goldy and her Goldilocks' catering company are hired to cater the luncheon for Mignon Cosmetics Company. Not a problem, until she finds out that her usual fare will not do, everything must be low cal and that is not Goldy's specialty. A dessert without butter and cream is not worth eating.Nevertheless, a job is a job and she must come up with something, little does she know that finding the right recipes will be the least of her problems. Mignon has been accused of animal testing and as she is trying to delivery the food for the banquet she is confronted by an angry mob and as Goldy is trying to battle her way into the venue there is a squeal of tires and one of Mignon's leading sales women is murdered in the parking lot.Turns out that there is quite a bit of corruption when it comes to beauty and once again, Goldy throws herself into the business of finding a murderer.As I said, this book was a bit of a let down for me, would I continue the series, I really do not know. However, I do tend to give authors one more chance that tends to lead to two or three more chances when I have started out enjoying the beginning of a series.

Oh goodness, I really should have read this book back in the day when I read the first two in the series. I loved those two books, but the shine is definitely off the apple with this one. Maybe it is because in the intervening years, I have read some remarkable young adult dystopian / science fiction novels and this one is showing its age.Originally published in 2006, the third book in the Uglies trilogy (which I have come to find out that there is a 4th book in the trilogy) has Tally becoming a member of the surgically enhanced group called the Cutter. This group has found that if you cut yourself, you will become more clear-headed in spite of the brain lesion used to make people pretty-minded. Because of this ability, they have been recruited into Special Circumstances where they are giving additional abilities.Yes, this is a bit confusing, but when you start the series from the beginning, it does make perfect sense.This book gets a bit confusing and twisty when a cadre characters and multiple situations are brought in, and once again, if I had read them all at once I am sure I would not constantly be playing catch-up. The Crims, the Smokies, Rusties, Crumblies, Fausto, Zane, etc., your mind begins to reel with the who's and what-for's.Being a Special is not all it is cracked up to be, you become pretty-minded and are repulsed by those less attractive and skilled than you are, so when Tally is cured, a whole new world and set of responsibilities open up for her. What will she do with this and how will she ensure that nature is protected from mankind's excesses.Apparently, there is a movie in the making for this series. Uglies opened the door for books such as Delirium and Hunger Games, so I guess that it is fitting that Hunger Games continues to hold the door open for Uglies in hope that there is a large enough market for this type of futuristic teen in peril plot.

Harper Connelly was struck by lightening as a child and has ever since been able to sense the dead. She can sense the final location and the final minutes of their life. So not having many other skills, she hires herself out to find missing persons, she see's it as helping, others see it as a way to take advantage of people at their most vulnerable moments.Harper travels from town to town with her step-brother Tolliver. They have a very strange relationship that left a funny feeling in me. He is supposed to be her bodyguard, but it plays off more incestuous then that. Harper is about 23, but is less than mature and quite incapable of taking care of herself while Tolliver appears to be the knight in shinning armour who saves her from the terrible fate of bad guys and lightening storms.This story was a bit twisted with Harper traveling to Sarne, Ark, to find the body of a missing girl. Finding the body is no problem, but being able to get back out of town still alive is the real challenge here. Too much seemed to be thrown into this book with who was related to whom and who was dating who and who sleeping with whom. Harpers relationship with the local cop seemed unnecessary and rather unbelievable. The whole book just didn't flow right.This is the first in the Harper Connolly series, but it left me a bit cold and I don't know if I will continue on.

Laskin's story chronicles a monster blizzard that devastated the Great Plains in January 1888 and left some 500 people -- mostly children trying to get home from school -- frozen dead on the prairie. After a slow start the book became fascinating to me. I could do without all the meteorological stuff or the too in-depth background, but the stories of the families, their struggles and their survival was riveting.

Charlotte leaves her sick bed for the first time in a year only to see her husband kissing another woman. Since this is only 1900 and there aren't many choices for a woman, she decides to take a break from her comfortable but stifling marriage and sets up housekeeping in Boston at The Beechmont, which turns out to be a male brothel in which handsome porters make discreet visits to the establishment's female clientele. There is a curious cast of characters, but they are too shallowly drawn to get a good liking for any of them. This book just rambles too much for my taste. It doesn't get interesting until well past page 100.

I was so glad to have found this series. Only three seasons long, it is one of those series that I enjoy coming back to time and time again.Staying in grand homes and setting the gardens to rights is always the main theme of each episode, but that seems to take a backseat to the murder de jour. Professional horticulturalist Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme seem to find a murder nearby when they are working on the most incredible garden landscapes. How much fun can there be pulling weeds and digging holes when there is a murder or three to be solved? So the two endearing amateur sleuths bring the ragged clues together in time to catch the culprit and tidy up the garden before the soiree of the moment takes place.This is one series that I had wished could go on forever, but I will just have to settle with watching these two women solve their landscaping issues and murder mysteries over and over again.

With 15 chapters of short stories, essays and random thoughts, Nora Ephron addresses the joys and traumas of being over 43 when maintenance takes more time than any reasonable person should invest themselves in, the definition of child rearing changes and how a love affair with an apartment can redefine who you are. Only a woman could understand how dead on this book is. And how laugh out loud funny we can be.

A phone call suddenly grabs Sue's attention when the caller informs her that he has her daughter and if she doesn't follow his specific instructions she will never see her daughter again. This isn't your typical "kidnapped book", it takes a bizarre twist midway through that has you turning the pages very quickly. Quite a few "ohh" and "yuck" moments, but still a good read.

Though this is book number three in the knitting book series, you don't really know that it is part of this series until the very end. No repeat characters, not the same location, just a quick mention in the very last chapter of buying a flower shop Blossom Street. This book can be read as a stand alone and you wouldn't miss a thing in the series.Susannah Nelson has a solid life, but something seems missing. There is no real spark or drive. She is a fifth grade teacher, she has a husband and two teenage children, but something is gone.When she gets a call and realizes that her mother is no longer able to live on her own since her husbands passing, Susannah decides to go home, to Colville, Washington to try and convince her mother that it's time to move into an assistant living facility.Going home brings about it's own trauma for Susannah, reoccurring dreams of a high school sweetheart, the death of her brother thirty years before and unresolved problems with her deceased father.Since she is now home, she decides to find Jake, the high school sweetheart, and find out why he suddenly disappeared from her life. Susannah finds so much more then she ever bargained for. A love is lost, but a greater love, the love of family, is found.

In this overly drawn out and obviously predictable movie Nick(Justin Chatwin) takes the blame for something that he didn't do only to be beaten nearly to death and while in this limbo state he wanders through his life invisible to others and trying to solve his own assault before he truly dies. Of course in the mean time, he has to save his best friend Pete, the girl that almost killed him and his very frosty mother played wonderfully by Marcia Gay Harden. Not the worst 2 hours that I have spent, but I don't want to do it again.

When people talk about the romance of the west they must be crazy. The west was a hard and horrible place or so this movie shows us. Duall and Jones take a herd of cows, horses, green cowboys and two pigs from Texas to Montana where they encounter some rather rough characters, Indians, old lovers and life long enemies. I loved this movie, loved how the characters would come and go and how the storylines built on themselves and then twisted back to the beginning to tell the whole story. Great Movie.

First of all, if you are picking up a Christopher Moore book, you must know that all sense of normality must be suspended. With that said, this book is a hoot.Even though this book takes place during the Christmas season I won't go so far as to call it a Christmas story Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. Being sure that he has just seen Santa take a shovel to the head, the seven year old has only one payer. "Please, Santa, come back from the dead".Archangel Raziel, who admits that he is attracted to lunatics, comes to Earth and finds his fair share in this small seaside community. He botches his mission and sends the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious, and horrifying, holiday party the town has ever seen.Thee are quite a few laugh out loud parts and if you are looking for a non-traditional Christmas story, check out this book. And if you are looking for a "you've got to be kidding" type of book, check out any book from this author. You won't be disappointed.

Somewhere in the middle of this Hawaiian travelogue, it must have dawned on Sue Henry that she was supposed to be writing a mystery. Literally, you are half way through this book before anything that even slightly smacks of a mystery appears. Grated, early on they find a hand towel stuffed into a drainpipe, but really, who can base a mystery on that.Maxie McNabb has left her beloved pooch Stretch at home in Homer, Alaska while she sets off to help an old friend tie up loose ends in Hawaii. Maxie spends most of the year traveling around the lower 48 in her motor home but figures Hawaii would just be another sort of adventure. Little did she know that Karen was up to her eyeballs in a questionable deal that has Maxie and her helper Jerry being followed around the island.It is not until the very end, when you are convinced that you have just wasted innumerable hours trying to figure out the point to this book, that the conclusion to the mystery unfolds. Sadly, the mystery seems to come across as a last ditch attempt to add a bit of intrigue - you find out that certain players in this Laurel and Hardy escapade are not who you think they are.If you are looking for a typical murder mystery, like her previous books, this is not it. This is a wild goose chase around Hilo that reads more like a travel brochure.

I really enjoy this series in audio version. Carolyn McCormick delivers a great narration. Beautiful women are found murdered and left in beautiful clothes, patients are found murdered in the hospital with coins on their eyes, including the mother of one of the Women's Murder Club - are the deaths related? Or is it just another horrible week in the life of Lindsey Boxer? The end got a little twisty and I had a hard time figuring it out, but it was still a good audio.

When I read a book jacket I get an idea stuck in my head on what a book will be about and I decide if it will appeal to me or not. Yes, it is a form of judging a book by its cover and yes, I do plead guilty to that. When I read the basic description of Invisible by Lorena McCourtney, I got into my mind that she was literally "invisible". I was thinking along the lines of the Bailey Ruth Series by Carolyn Hart. A series that I enjoyed but unfortunately, that is not the kind of invisible that Ivy is.Ivy Malone is a middle aged woman (even though I have no idea what that really means since she seems to be rather fit when outrunning a junk yard dog) that has gotten to the stage in her life where she is no longer noticed by other people. With this newfound realization, she has decided it would be a perfect opportunity to investigate the death of a local woman.There are multiple storylines going on here from cemetery vandalism, to business fraud to young love to Ivy being alone with a man, and somehow, most of them come together at the end. The story is long and drawn out in an overly simplistic and boring way that still has me wondering how I managed to finish this book.I missed that this was a Christian fiction book before I began reading and the constant Bible references were a bit too much for my enjoyment. The characters were too boring, the plots were unrealistic and Ivy herself was not a convincing or engaging character. Guess I need more bite and less preaching in my mysteries

I never thought that this book would end. Being a totally character driven book filled with the requisite quirky Southern personalities, you are introduced to Laurie Lepanto and her group of widowed ladies who call themselves the Nitwitts, Laurie's dashing dancing man Powell, the lovelorn Mr. Choppy and various other personalities of Second Creek, Mississippi. In an effort to keep open the local Piggly Wiggly, that is being edged out of town by the new Mega Mart, Laurie and her Nitwitts decide to offer a waltz with Powell down the isles of the Piggly Wiggly while the box boys gather up their orders. Little does anybody know, but this is one can of worms that Mr. Choppy didn't know would change his life forever.

Alex Winston is desperately trying to hold on to the family lighthouse named Hatteras West which is interestingly located in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Not your typical location for a lighthouse, but one that attracts a wide variety of people. That is until one guest is found dead at the top of the lighthouse with an ice pick in the back and another looks to have been pushed off of Bear Rocks. It is now up to Alex to find the killer, keep the boiler running on the old Inn and have the beds made before the next guest checks in. Just your typical day as an Innkeeper.Fun start to the lighthouse series by Tim Meyers. Look forward to seeing the unique characters again that make up the background in this book.

Other than the lack of medical care, the possibility of starvation and certain isolation, there is something to be said about the simpler times that are reflected upon in Little House in the Big Woods.Laura Ingles Wilder returns to the time with her family before they moved to the prairie where their life revolved upon mere existence including Pa playing fiddle and telling stories of his time as a boy or how his father did things differently.Ma is a stoic creature that is in constant food and sewing mode. If Pa brought it home, Ma had a way to prepare it. Be it cloth or bear meat the family must get ready for the hard winter ahead.For me, I had to put aside the television show that I grew up with and concentrate on what Laura was telling. There are parts that are the same, the essence is there, but the book has a much slower pace. There is a sweetness to the simplicity, a closeness amongst the family and a devotion to working together to make it through.This book is a true classic and should continue to be shared with your young ones before they become too jaded.

This movie adaptation of J.K. Rowlings 5th book was unfortunately a let down for me. You definitely needed to have read the book first to understand what was going on in the movie. Favorite scenes from the book were left out - Quiddich. Favorite characters - Hagrid, Creature and Tonks had very minimal parts. The movie is very dark in both cinematography and subject. The characters all have a harder edge and definitely not a children's movie. Imelda Staunton who was cast as the perfect Delores Umbridge literally steals the whole movie. Harry, Hermoine and Ron all seem to be getting a little too old for the characters that they play. The best part of the movie was the last 30 minutes, unfortunately you had to sit through the first two hours to get there.

It must be very disappointing for Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson to be upstaged by a seven-year-old child (played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones), but that is exactly what happened in this Disney family movie. I am not going to go as far as to say that I loved the film, because for me, the movie did not get interesting until we were two-thirds of the way in -- and that is just a bit too far. The scene between Damon and his fourteen-year-old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, is what opened up this formulaic adaptation, it just took too long to get to the good stuff.Based on the book by Benjamin Mee, the family is in turmoil following the death of Ben's wife and the family is in desperate need of a getaway. Not just physically, but emotionally, so when Ben and Rosie go house hunting a curious thing happens. The perfect house is available, the only stipulation, a small zoo is also part of the package.With no experience and very limited funds, Ben jumps in with both feet, and is able to turn the place into a home for both his family and the abandoned animals.As I said, this film is based very loosely on a book by Benjamin Mees. The Mee's zoo is actually located in England whereas the fictional Rosemoor Wildlife Park is portrayed to be located in California. There are a couple of facts that are toyed with, but for a child going to see this movie, that does not matter. The animals are adorable and Rosie will appeal to even the hardest heart.There have been some complaints about the language used by the 7-year-old daughter, but for me that was not too big of a deal. That is how some children talk, and to be honest, it was a funny scene.Do I recommend it, yes, but only if you are not expecting high drama and like a little sugar coating.

Based on the short story of the same name by William J. Locke, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench play aging sisters Janet and Urusla, living in Cornwall who discover a body washed up on their coastline. They nurse this barely alive young Polish man back to the land of the living and learn quite by accident that he is a talented violinist. In nursing him and learning to communicate with him, quite a few emotions are surfaced by the sisters, one who has lost a husband to war and one who has never had a chance to love.Billed as a sort of fairytale, complete with a wicked witch who swoops in and changes everyone lives, this wonderful coming of age (even if you are 60) story hits a tender spot and make you realize that a crush can happen at any age.

The last 10 minutes of this movie still have me confused, but that being said, I still enjoyed this movie. Once your ears get used to the accents you really don't hear it anymore, you are engrossed in the sweet story of Liz and her son Frankie.Liz flees with Frankie to Scotland to escape the bonds of an abusive man and pretends Frankie's father is aboard a ship called the HMS Accra. After setting the story for Frankie and pretending for years, which include fake letters detailing adventures and destinations, the make-believe story comes to a crashing end when Frankie learns that the ship has docked near their new home and Liz must find a man who is willing to pretend he is Frankie's dad. What could be comical is bittersweet and a deaf little boy is left with magical memories.

A kidnapper has soon contacted Quincy, but the demands seems all wrong. What is going on. Together with Quincy's adult daughter, they are going to find Rainie.Told in the various voices of the characters involved, the read soon see's a deeper plot developing. What was it in Rainie's past that has brought them all to this point. Can a child really be responsible or are they just a ploy to make Rainie pay for her choices. A past that she too, should never been part of.Though good, this book didn't fully capture my attention. It had too much of a been there done that feel. The characters are engaging and flawed, but still something for me was missing. Maybe this was a series that I should have started at the beginning, I never really got a good feel for who the main characters really are.

Struggling to put his life and career back together after serving time for embezzling and defrauding his clients, attorney David Hirsh is approached at minyon by Abe Shifrin a member of his synagogue. It is coming up on the third anniversary of his daughter Judith's death and he would like David to finally find justice for her. Knowing of this car accident David thinks that there is little that can be done considering the only other person in the car was a US District Judge and the case was closed.Little did David know that what he was getting into when he agreed to look into it from a product liability case involving faulty tires and big names. What begins as a simple inquiry turns into a case of cold-blooded murder and high-level conspiracy.The reader is taken deep into the legal and religious world of David Hirsh. At some points a non-lawyer like me got a little lost, but the story is tightly wound with enough Yiddish thrown in that it makes you glad that there is a little dictionary in the back. Told in much the same way as Turow or Grisham, this book will keep you engaged to the end.Favorite character was Rosenbloom with his raw humor, intelligence and love of the fight.

I have been watching The Tudors and decided to take a little side trip and watch The Other Boleyn Girl (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana) to get a feel for more of the Boleyn story. Well, now I am completely confused.Though both stories are dealing within the same period and the same basic characters, the two adaptations could not be any more different. Now I understand poetic license, but when facts are toyed with, it leaves the watcher quite befuddled.For instance, Mary Boleyn is referred to as the older sister in The Tudors and the younger sister in The Other Boleyn Girl, so off to Google to find out. According to The House of Tudor, Mary is the older sister. OK, The Tudors got this one right. The Other Boleyn Girl tell of an illegitimate child that Mary bore during her time with Henry the VIII, The Tudor's doesn't comment on this. This time to Wiki. Apparently, Mary bore two children, but then again who is counting. So I will give that one to The Other Boleyn Girl. Now the most curious part, the end of The Other Boleyn Girl shows Mary taking the young Elizabeth and leaving Court to raise the child. Really, does anyone think that was possible? I thought Governess cared for her, but then people do like a happily ever after ending when dealing with royalty.The more I look into the Tudor history, the more confused I get. I understand that movie making is supposed to be fantasy, but how hard would it be to research what is "known" and go from there instead of making it up as you go.Now back to the actual movie. Overall, it is quite a stunning spectacle. The costuming and staging are beautiful. The casting is reasonable, though Henry should have been shorter and rounder, but then again who would want to see that. I have also seen in some reviews that the sex scenes in The Other Boleyn Girl shocked people. Well, if you are offended by that, which there really was not much shown, it is a PG-13 after all; I suggest that you completely bypass The Tudors. That one will make you blush.Unless you know some of the prior history of the time, you would have been lost in this movie. The timing is a bit choppy, sort of like a Cliff Notes version of a small part of the Tudor Period. If you are not looking for a history lesson you might like this movie, but just be warned that it is an adaptation of Philippa Gregory's historical fiction novel and not necessarily a work of fact.

No wonder Helen Mirren won the best actress award. She was absolutely marvelous. This movie takes place the during the week of Princess Diana's death. The movie depicts the behind the scenes wrangling between the royal family and Tony Blair in how the family was going to handle the funeral of the People's Princess versus the fact that she was no longer a royal. How much influence Blair had and how torn the queen was between duty and being a grandmother. I hope that Queen Elizabeth had as much compassion as the film depicted, but I have a new dislike for Prince Phillip - what a jerk.

Natalie Barnes has decided to go for broke and trade her life saving for a Bed and Breakfast called the Grey Whale Inn on Cranberry Island in Maine. Soon the slimy Bernard Katz shows up and announces plans to change the whole inland into a mega resort which will include turning the Grey Whale into a parking lot. So no one is surprised when he is found dead, the only surprise is the who and why. Natalie just has to stay alive long enough to get the whole story out. Great start to a new series plus great recipes at the end of the book.Oh, and someone needs to tell the author that you don't get knitting wool from a goat.

A long drawn out tedious book. Based on the 1918 Flu Epidemic that swept across America. This book takes place in the mythical town of Commonwealth, Washington. When the flu begins to hit neighboring towns hard, the owners of a remote mill town decide to cut themselves off and live in a self imposed quarantine. All seems to go well until the flu comes to town. Was it carried by the two soliders or were there other reasons? Alot of guilt and a lot of finger pointing. The last quarter of the book was better then the beginning. You just have to muddle through to get there.

Let us begin at the end where I can honestly say, "I didn't see that coming". Usually writers lead you down a rambling path where you at least think you know where you are going. You might have chosen a different style or a different course, but in the end, it always leads to the most likely suspect. Well, let me tell you, the who-done-it in one of these stories completely blew me away.Case Histories is the first in a series featuring Jackson Brodie, a retired police officer turned private detective who is hired to solve three old cases. Told in a spiral fashion, the reader is introduced to Amelia and Julia who's three-year-old sister Olivia went missing 30 years ago. Theo Wyre whose daughter was killed by a lunatic who barged into Theo's law practice wearing a yellow golf sweater and Shirley Morrison who is trying to locate her sister Michelle who was living a rather isolated existence with her husband and daughter.Told in a spiral story-within-a-story fashion, the reader is dragged back and forth through all three plots and the timeframe that they take place until by the end they all seem to wrap themselves up in a rather neat orderly manner - that is all except the one that I didn't see coming. I actually found myself looking back over the book to see what I had missed.Be prepared for red herrings and more than a couple throw away characters, but do note, you have to pay attention. This book is not an easy read, you have your work cut out for you and there is a set ups for the next book in the series. So if you are ready for a thinking person's book, take your time and dig in.

In this debut novel in Harrison's Gardening Mystery Series we are introduced to Bretta Solomon a recently widowed woman who in addition to learning how to deal with her grief, owns a flower shop which she describes as her life's passion, the towns reaction to her recent weight loss and the murder of Isaac Miller an Amish farmer.If that sounded confusing, well then you get the gist of this book. Too much was going on - too many tangents. It was all roughly connected, but too many storylines and an over abundance of metaphors.

Oh sure, wait until the last line of the book to grab my attention. After the way that Agatha's life has been going, this was definitely an unexpected surprise and it will keep the Agatha Raisin lovers tuned into the next book.Agatha is feeling a twinge in her hip and refuses to believe that it could be arthritis. Ailments are for old people and being slightly over 50 she is too young. That does not mean that crumbling into old age is her lot in life, but still, with no man and a detective agency that is barely stumbling long leaves Agatha with too much time on her hands and too many freewheeling thoughts in her head.Tired of locating errant cats, Agatha needs a juicy case to work. In walks Robert Smedley, of Smedleys Electronics, determined to prove that his younger wife Mable is cheating on him. Finally, a spark appears in Agatha's bear like eyes.Well, darn it if Mabel is not the perfect wife. Now what is Agatha to do? Once again, things are looking a tad boring until Robert Smedley is poisoned with weed killer and Mabel appears as the prime suspect. Not to say that she is the only suspect, as Mrs. Bloxby says, there is no telling what is in the hearts of women.A few more twists and accompanying storylines are floating within this book, but unfortunately, for me the whole thing never really took off and held my attention - that is until the very last sentence. Sir Charles Fraith is still lurking about and does come to Agatha's rescue before she can once again make a fool of herself and an unnecessary couple of paragraphs show up with Agatha saving Roy Silver's reputation, but for the most part, the book was a bit flat.

In this HBO drama you see the life of Winston Churchill, played wonderfully by Albert Finney just before the beginning of WWII. He is not quite the towering figure that you have read about, but he does still have the amazing ego, this is the part of his life where he is facing bankruptcy, he is a laughing stock, and he battles what he and his family call "the black dog" (depression). He is fighting the British government over their refusal to see the strength of Germany and the threat of Hitler. But all this refocuses his life, gives him new energy and with his devoted wife Clemmie (Vanessa Redgrave) adds the spunk that was missing.Very enjoyable movie with quite memorable quotes throughout. My favorite being: "Dogs will look up to you, cats will look down on you, but pigs, they treat you as equals"

I adored this movie. Don't let the 2 hour production time scare you off; it goes by in a flash. In this 2005 documentary, 5th graders from New York City public schools learn ballroom dancing (merengue, rumba, tango, the foxtrot and swing) as part of a 10 week course. As they learn the dances and the disciplines involved you see them change from shy skittish children to consummate dancers all culminating in the final citywide competition.You get to really know these wonderful children. From the very shy boys who can't open their eyes when dancing with a girl to the very dominating girls who feel that if a boy can't lead, well, they will do it themselves. This added with additional footage of candid conversations show you that kids are just kids. Some might be tougher on the outside, but they all have the same dream and aspirations.I will certainly miss these children and I just hope that their dreams are fulfilled.

The Girls are Rose and Ruby conjoined twins, connected inseparably, facing the world side by side. The book chronicles their life journey; a story of love between sisters. This story will definately stay with me for awhile.Lansens gives the girls two very different and seperate voices without losing the bond that they share. I loved the beginning, thought that the middle was slower but liked how she would drop in shocking moments and the ending just left me breathless.

Not all the reviews are favorable, but I really enjoyed this mesmerizing book. Not all the questions are answered, but that's the way it should be; it opens up more possibilities.15 years ago, on the day that the three Winter sisters decide to run away from their drunken father and their less than perfect mother, five year old Ellie disappears. After the discovery of a photo in a magazine, their mother is determined to find this person in hopes that it is Ellie. Unfortunately she doesn't get the chance and Caroline, the one who has run off to New Orleans in hopes of finding a life, takes up the challenge.What Caroline finds instead is herself, the person who has been running and trying to be lost. Sometimes what you find isn't exactly what you were looking for.A great cast of characters with storylines that twist upon themselves and in the end you are left with questions, wondering and hope.

4+ Stars. First in the Booked for Travel Series. Lynne Montgomery is leading a tour group through the Sonoma Valley. Each member seems to have their own story so there are multiple lines to follow. After a contentious purchasing of a vineyard in Sonoma Valley, Lance Belladuce is found dead. There is more than one person that wanted this young man dead but who actually did it and why. I really enjoyed this book, though the end did come abruptly and I had already discounted the person who was actually the murder. Guess you can never tell.

To date, I think this was my favorite book in this series. All the characters were there in all their feistiness. Even Grandma Bella and her Evil Eye.Once again Stephanie is out of money and will take any FTA, this one turns out to be a very stubborn "littler person" who in turn decides to move into Stephanie's apartment, which wouldn't be so bad if she wasn't already distracted by her overly cheap Uncle Fred who went MIA while trying to right a $2.00 wrong at the trash company.Things start to heat up when she starts spending a little too much time with Ranger and now is having the Ranger/Morelli conflict. Some girls have all the luck. Now to find Fred, who's wife really doesn't mind that he's missing, keep out of the way of a psycho boxer, get a dwarf (after calling Stephanie a loser, the gets called names too), choose between Ranger and Morelli, keep a taser away from grandma, chauffer a child sheik, dodge a killer, and stop getting cars destroyed all seem to be a week in the life of Stephanie.Great fast paced book with lots of storylines and great giggles. I highly recommend this one.

This is my favorite Sookie book to date. And why is that -- no brooding Bill and annoying Eric. After the previous five books, that was starting to get on my nerves, I liked how book number six has taken a slightly different path with a flavor of other characters added in.Now if you are keeping score between the television show and the books, book six and season three are almost on the same path. The books help you with what isn't mentioned on the show, but .... the show has tweaked the storylines to the point that they only "kinda-sort-of" reflect the books. Individually, they are, and good, but when you are trying to do both, you find yourself getting angry and frustrated. Characters that are alive and well in one, have been killed off in the other and vice versa. Main storylines in the books are curiously adapted into another directions with creative license is alive and well, when it comes to this series.Back to this book, Sookie is at her deceased cousin Hailey's house to clean out her belongings when the spell that Amelia the landlord and resident witch, had put on the home wears off and an ominous odor takes over. That could only mean one thing here - there is a dead body and dead bodies have a way of leading to bad things when Sookie is involved.This is the book where you learn a little bit more about the King and Queen of Louisiana and the evil doings that each are involved in. The Debbie Pelt thing is all tied up, Claudine has a major part and Quinn is turning into a character that I am truly enjoying. If you didn't like Bill prior to this book, you are really going to despise him now. A major revelation as to why he came to Bon Temps in the first place is revealed. This is most definitely a game changer. We also find out why Sookie is so special. Why vampires are drawn to her and why mortal men are distant? I just loved this book. Ties up many loose ends and leaves enough strings dangling that you cannot help but to look forward to the next.This book seems to be a dividing line for many followers of the series, I for one, loved it, thought it was the best by far, others readers not so much. I suggest that you start at the beginning and form you own opinion without watching the television series first. That would be a disappointment.

Maybe I need to spread these books out a little bit more, because all of a sudden they are blurring one right into the other. After putting this one down for a couple of days, I truly couldn't remember what it was about, I had to grab it out of the donation pile just to remind myself what the focus was.If you have not read this series from the beginning, do not continue with this review, because there might be some spoilers. We know that Sookie is a waitress with a disability; she can read the minds of those around here, those that just happen to not be vampires. Therefore, when Alcide Herveaux asks Sookie to help read the minds of his "were" pack in hopes of helping his father become the next leader, she really has no choice. Well, of course she can do that, even if it is a strange ritual and parts of it just are not something that Sookie would ever like to know exists.Then add in someone who is out trying to kill shape shifters and Sookie's house is partially burned and Jason is still dealing with his own monthly difficulties and Tara is keeping vampires in her house and you have yet another week in the life of Sookie.As I said before, maybe I need to spread these books out a bit more. They are starting to be the same story over and over with slight character changes in each installment. Skookie is a very likeable simpleminded character that always seems to get herself into one hot mess after another and needs to depend on her otherworldly friends to get her out.I do not know what direction Charlene Harris will take these books, but the one thing that I do know, that kindly looking grandma sure has some hot blood running through her veins.

By the time this book was over, I could not tell you if the whole Stephanie Plum storyline had moved forward or not. The book started slow and never really picks up any momentum.Stephanie embarks on what she considers an easy-peasy assignment; bring in Eddie DeChooch an octogenarian mobster. How difficult could that be, he drives around Trenton in a white Cadillac, kind of stands out, even for Trenton. Well, when it comes to Stephanie nothing is ever easy, especially when there is corpse found in Eddie's garage.Not only does she have to find this gangster, but she also has to come up with a date for her pending nuptials to Joe, but then again, why would she do that when Ranger has offered her an evening of bliss. Decisions, Decisions.Add in perfect sister Valerie coming back for more than a visit and the shambles of Stephanie's life is certainly on a roll, if only we knew which direction she would go.I will continue with the series, I just hope the next one keeps my interest a little better.

First in the Nell Sweeney / Gilded Age Series. Nell Sweeney is an assistant to Dr. Greaves, a man that has saved her from her past, when one evening they are called out to assist in a birth that will change Nell's life. Next thing she knows she is a Governess to this child and within 3 years is a trusted companion to the head of the house and is sent on an adventure to save the woman's son, who was thought to be dead, from a hanging for a murder that he is being charged with. From opium dens to high society this book looks at the life of the Hewitt family and their many secrets. This book is more character driven then actual murder mystery, but the characters are very engaging and Nell is a very independent thinking woman for the late 19th Century in which this book takes place.

I almost gave up on this movie. About one-third of the way through and I was bored senseless. There seemed to be no forward movement and the acting felt stagnant. I knew that Denzel Washington couldn't let me down in this way and Jurnee Smollett is just too captivating of an actress to not keep my attention, so I decided to give it jus a little bit more time.Once we hit the halfway point I was hooked, I do not know for sure what happened, but the storyline started to evolve and I was becoming more attached to the characters and the story they were telling.Based on the true story of Melvin B. Tolson, a professor at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, who inspired his students to form the school's first debate team. Not just any debate team, but a team from a small rural all-African-American college during the height of the depression. A team that would one day take on the likes of Harvard in the national championship and would go on to record one of the greatest debate records of their time.I do not know if this movie will appeal to all, but if you stick with it and watch the extra footage at the end of the DVD, you will get a completely new appreciation of the people and the times. This was an extraordinary group of young people and to see what they have achieved since is in itself remarkable.

If you enjoy Craig Johnson, then William Kent Krueger is right up you alley. Both write the cold backcountry police procedural with folklore and the surrounding environment being as essential a character as anyone else mentioned in the storyline.Cork O'Connor and his attorney wife Jo are in the middle of a separation due to his downward spiral after losing an election to maintain his position as sheriff. Now out of the house and trying to keep an old run down seasonal restaurant afloat, Cork receives a call from a friend that is panicked over her missing son. Of course, there is more to the story, since Paul's last newspaper delivery was to the local judge's home and now the judge has been found with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Everyone but Cork is in a hurry to close this case, but there is something nagging at Cork. This suicide is tied up too neat and clean and that is just something that does not settle right with the ex-Sheriff in him.Then one night it all comes to a boiling point. A Windigo is calling out names, ambitions fuel murder, secrets that should stay hidden are photographed for all to see and Cork is right there in the middle with an unlikely ally and a future that will undoubtedly be even more complicated then what he was bargaining for.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the next in the series. There were a couple of loose ends left dangling and I am glad that Krueger did not wrap everything up in a neat little bow. This is a book that you have to let sit with you for a little while. You have to let the relationships float around in your brain and wonder aloud, what if or what about, before you can put the whole story to rest.Good job Mr. Krueger.

We have all been there with a child "oh, please, can I, please-please, oh, come on let me". Well, with this book, the tables are turned just a bit when the bus driver tasks the reader with not allowing the pigeon to drive the bus.It is a very funny premise. No matter how much the pigeon wheels and deals, the reader is not allowed to let the pigeon drive. That is one funny clever pigeon, but as the story comes to an end, the pigeon has a better plan, a much bigger plan, a new love.A funny, funny, book that will help to teach responsibility in a very practical straightforward way.Loved this book.

This is one of those endearing holiday movies that I love watching each year. Seth Webster is a widowed father trying to raise his twin sons. Mrs. Merkle comes to the rescue when the most recent nanny leave, but Mrs. Merkle is no ordinary nanny. She is a heavenly emissary and her job will not be done until Seth opens his heart and allow himself to greive his wife's death and to allow a new love into his heart and home.This movie should be added to you annual - snuggle in because Christmas is coming - list of movies to watch year in and year out.

Ali Reynolds is finally putting another chapter of her life behind her. She is heading to Los Angeles from her home in Sedona, Arizona, to finalize her divorce. But when her husband doesn't show up for the appointed court date things get a little curious. Turns out Paul Grayson was kidnapped from his bachelor party, yep, the cad was going to remarry the day after the divorce was granted. Not only was Paul abducted, but he was bound, placed in the trunk of a car and left to die on a railroad track.Since the divorce was never granted, that leaves Ali to be the grieving widow, that not quite being her style she sets out to find who and what was behind this ghastly act.As Ali keeps the reader of her blog updated, we slowly see the story and Ali's role in it slowly unwind. With great twists and an unpretentious cast of characters, Jance leads the reader to a thrilling conclusion that leaves you wondering what can Ali get into next. Thankfully, this is only the second book in the series, so it won't be long until I can delve into Ali's world again.

There was a great deal about the Surgeon that reminded me of James Patterson's Women's Murder Mystery Series. I do not know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but I can tell you that this book was more on the creepier gorier side than Patterson and for that, and the more intense writing, I think I have found a new series to follow.Yes, I know that I am a little late to this rodeo since the book was written in in 2001, but all good things come to those that wait. Since the publishing industry only gives new writers three books to make their mark and Tess Gerritson has been around a good long time - I figured she must have something good to bring to the table and I was not disappointed.Two years prior, Dr. Catherine Cordell fought back and beat her attacker. She does not remember the second shot that killed the man that had drugged her and had plans to incise her body organs, but she sure knows that she killed him. His body was laying there on her bedroom floor - two shots to the head.That is until a new killer re-creates, with precise techniques, Cordell's attack and now the Boston news media has nicknamed him The Surgeon. As the bodies pile up, no one can answer the questions - how does he know things about his victims? What inside information does he have that should terrify the women of Boston? Most importantly, why is he taunting Cordell with each murder?Under hypnosis, Catherine recalls one very important bit of information.Thomas Moore needs to save Catherine, he needs to find the link between the past and the present before Dr. Cordell is the final victim.Terrifying in its possibility, this book, will stay with you for a long time.

Cozies are character driven and this book definitely has its share of characters.Not only is Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton the Lady of Sitting Marsh Manor House, but she is also responsible for helping her tenants muddle through during World War II England. Little did she know that when Winnie stopped her to ask if she had seen her daughter Beryl - who has quite a reputation for hanging out at the pub and flirting with the Yanks; Lady Elizabeth would find herself in the middle of a murder mystery. Not only that, but she has to prepare for an American invasion all her own.A great cast of characters including Violet the housekeeper and the irrepressible Martin the butler.First in the Manor House Series.

Unfortunately after the second book, this series has run its course with me. No real spark or endearing characters that make you want to dive into the next one.Alex Winston runs a bed and breakfast that has the distinction of having a replica of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and its outbuildings. What's so curious about that, well, there is no water around just a lighthouse sitting in the foothills of North Carolina.While embroiled in the daily duties of running the inn and trying to bring the lighthouse back to its glory, Alex agrees to let Shantana run the Golden Days Fair on his property. Things seem to be going smoothly, that is until a local blacksmith is found impaled with a very unique piece of metalwork and everyone seems to be a suspect.This story quickly bogs down and by the time the killer is revealed, it really doesn't matter because my attention is no longer on the book. My mind has wandered and I was trying to figure out what I was going to read next. Not a good sign.

A Southern tale of murder and deception surrounding a man who comes back home to Mirabeau, Texas to help with the care of his ailing mother.His "been out of the area too long" ways irritate Miss Beta Harcher who feels that Jordan Poteet is allowing too many books into the library that are corrupting the minds of the young. After a very heated argument that is witnessed by quite a few town folk, Beta is found murdered in the library leaving Jordy as the prime suspect. It doesn't help that there is also a list of names, Jordy included, with Bible verses attached tucked into Beta's shirt that lead to while speculation as to what the true purpose of her murder was.Thus leads the reader on a twisted tale of the many that could be responsible and their own reasons for why they could have done it.The book is very slow in the middle, but ends quite well; with a very good lead into the remainder of the series.Don't know if I could actually recommend this book since I couldn't wait for it to end, but with some better pacing this could have been a very good book.

Actually, I think that I enjoyed this one better than the first. Carnegie is organizing the wedding of a good friend when people start dying. She thinks she has it figured out only to discover that she is unknowingly giving clues to the real killer. As for the end - That was so totally unfair, ending abruptly with an "oh my gosh moment making me scramble for the next in the series.

Catherine is your typical 12 year old. All she wants is a normal life with normal friends, not people who look at her funny or make fun of her autistic brother David. She loves him, but that's quite hard at times when she is embarrassed by so much of what he does. The only way to bring normality to her life is to make up rules, which she keeps with her in the back of her sketch book. Rules such as "No Toys in the Fish Tank", "Pantless Brothers are Not my Problem" are part of her everyday life.A new girl moves into the neighborhood and Catherine finally feels that she will have a chance at a new life. But will David ruin this too?Just when Catherine is overly wrapped up in David and Kristi, she meets a young boy at her brother's therapy clinic and the two hit it off in quite a unique way; opening Catherine's eyes to a life outside of the rules.I enjoyed this book and its overall message of acceptance.

With Jimmy Raisin now dead and James Lacey hightailing it away from their wedding, Agatha is aghast that James would leave for their intended honeymoon destination without her. It was just a misunderstanding that she really was not a widow, but Agatha knows she can make amends if James would just give her a chance. Therefore, off to Cyprus and God willing she will get her man, but first she has to find him.Agatha finally meets up with a very cold and brusque James and they are quickly drawn into a group of Europeans that somehow involve Agatha in yet another mystery. With the help of an old friend Sir Charles Fraith, one that Agatha really should avoid but yet makes for a very interesting twist to anger James, Agatha continues her investigation into not one but now two murder mysteries, which at times has Agatha in danger of losing her own life.Though not a very imaginative book, the Agatha saga has me following story after story just to see what lie Agatha will tell next and how she will get herself of out her next sticky situation.The one endearing part of this book is a very interesting conversation between Agatha and James when he explains his conflict with her and for the first time I see James really opening up. Now if only Agatha could see it that way and stop throwing Charles in his face.

A group of stock car racing fans embarks on a bus tour of Southern speedways--seven states in eight days--as a tribute to legendary NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt. I know most won't be interested in this quirky book, but I really enjoyed it. The tour participants are quite interesting in their own right, but you really get to know them all and I will miss them. Plus with McCrumb's sense of humor you learn more about NASCAR then you thought you would want to. Didn't know that NASCAR also stands for Non-Athletic Sport Centered Around Rednecks.

For me, the actual murder in the Agatha Raisin books is secondary to the ongoing of the characters involved. With each book you pick up, Agatha finds herself embroiled in another domestic situation, with it being either her missing almost ex-husband James, the new neighbor - which is always an attractive man, Bill Wong - her favorite policeman, or my favorite Mrs. Bloxby. A perfect counterbalance to Agatha, who always keeps things in perspective and possesses the perfect words of wisdom that Agatha needs to hear even if she does not want to.Since all the Agatha books involve a murder, The Case of the Curious Curate begins with the arrival of a very attractive man - the golden haired Curate Tristan Delon. Though initially beguiled, Agatha starts to wonder if the young man is too good to be true, that is until he is found dead in the Vicar's study and Agatha must unsnarl the goings on to help her friends the Bloxby's.At first blush you would not think that the village of Carsely would be capable to such evildoings, but as the bodies start to pile up. Not only does Agatha needs to dig deeper into this murder to find the killer, but also to prevent further wrong doings and to make sure that the right person is behind bars.I truly enjoy this series, Agatha to grow on you. She can be the pushiest most annoying character that you run across, but deep down the woman cares for those around her, she just has a harsh and pushy way of showing it.Start at the beginning and watch Agatha grow as a woman but also as a friend. Under all the gruffness, she is very charming.

As I have said before, the Agatha Raisin books are no longer about the dead body in the other room; they are about the interactions between the recurring cast of characters and the maturing of Agatha. As she comes to realize that she is important and that people do care about her - even if she tries to stare them down with her bear like eyes and doesn't understand that when she spout off at the mouth there is a living breathing human being at the pointy end of her jabs - they just have to be willing to get beyond the wall that she has built.What could be more tempting than a report of a haunted house? Agatha, with the help of her new neighbor Paul Chatterton, head out to do a little detecting and spend the night doing their own Ghost Hunters type of investigating. But when Agatha gets a little more than what she was expecting and the nasty Mrs. Witherspoon is soon found dead, Agatha once again finds herself knee deep in an investigation and Bill Wong must come to the rescue.A new day has dawned for Agatha. No longer is she languishing away because a man is not paying attention to her. She is now seeing them as a distraction and she has a new direction in life.By the way, when did Agatha get sexy? I remember the previous books discussing her in a frumpy sort of way. Now she is turning heads and the ladies of Carsley are a bit on the jealous side. This is a new turn and I hope that it will add yet another dimension to a wonderfully curious woman.

I have to admit that if it were not for the fact that I had been listening to this book on CD while driving to and from work, I would have tossed it midway. I understand that it was meant to be a slow meandering journey through the life of Natalie Seebring, interweaving the lives of her children and Olivia Jones who was hired as her personal assistant and biographer. Let us face it; this was so monotonous that it allowed my mind to wander without feeling that I missed a thing.In the past, I loved Lake News and An Accidental Woman and have been in a never-ending search for a Delinsky book that lives up to those two - I just have not found it.Olivia Jones dreams of a family that she could be a part of. As a photo restorer, she visualizes herself in the lives of those that she looks at every day; imagining what it would be like to have a family that is happy to be together. A family that share their lives together. Being a single parent of a difficult dyslexic ten year old is not easy, but this is the life that she has been dealt and will make the best of, but that does not stop her from dreaming.Natalie Seabring is about to drop a bombshell on her family. Recently widowed after fifty-eight years of marriage, Natalie has announced her upcoming plans to wed Carl Burke, vineyard employee. Her children only know him as a man that helped their beloved father build the Asquonset Vineyard in Rhode Island. What could Carl be up to; they do not trust him and begin to question their mother's devotion to their father.Responding to an inquiry for a biographer, Olivia applies and when offered the job, she and her daughter Tess set out for the adventure that they need to change their lives. A summer away on a beautiful vineyard with the ocean in their backyard and a hope for a fresh start for both mother and daughter is what both desperately need.As the memoir unfolds, lives on Asquonset will be forever c hanged. Dreams are shattered and hopes are realized as layers are revealed. Natalie's life was not as charmed as her children had always thought. The woman that they felt had always been distant now explains to them the sacrifices that she was willing to make for the love of family. Now it is her turn, she is going to pursue her dreams and her children had better get onboard.Though a generation separates Natalie and Olivia, each woman has something to share and learn from the other. Both are seeking what is missing in their lives and both appreciate that reality can be so much more than the fantasy that they had idealized.

This drama starting Helena Bonham Carter as the 15 year old Lady Jane Grey depicts the nine days of 1553 that Jane's rule as Queen before Princess Mary over throws her and assumes the throne. In an underhanded way of keeping the crown from the Church of Rome, Jane is forced into a position that she is unprepared for and when the lies and power struggles are revealed she and her new husband, Guilford Dudley (Cary Elwes) are imprisoned and sentenced to die. Apparently it's not historically accurate, but a nice love story, even if there is no proof that the real Jane and Guilford actually liked each other.

Needing a break from heavier books, I always return to Aunt Dimity for a bit of R&R.;During Lori's volunteer work at Radcliffe Infirmary, she is saddened to learn that Elizabeth Beacham, a legal secretary, has had no visitors during her stay. Well, that just can't be, so Lori packs off with her book cart and approaches Elizabeth with books and conversation. Soon a kindred friendship develops, but it ends way too soon.Finding out that Elizabeth did have a relative, one who could have visited, she sets off to find this wayward brother and of course this is where the mystery begins. Being left with a letter and two keys, Lori finds out about Lizzie's life; and of course it wasn't what it appeared to be. Elizabeth was a much more extraordinary woman than even Lori could have imagined and because of Lori's kindness, the loved ones in Lori's life will benefit from a woman that they didn't even know.I enjoyed this book, may of the previous characters are mentioned and their storylines are moved forward. I had been disappointed in the previous book (Aunt Dimity Snowbound) but this one has made up for that.

No matter how much I adore Agatha Raisin, some books just aren't as good as others. This is one of those that missed the mark for me. A little on the boring side with very little momentum to keep the storyline moving forward.Since Agatha had quite the hair incident at the end of Wizard of Evesham, she has decided to take a holiday to the seaside town of Wyckhadden. She needs a break from her life and most definitely a break from James Lacey.What she finds is a small hotel with horrible elderly guests and nasty weather. Not exactly the restful situation she was looking for. Having nowhere else to turn, she settles in and learns of Francie Juddle the local witch. Well, things are looking up for Agatha and she head out to investigate. What is even more interesting is the supposed love potion that Francie brews.Once again, Agatha stumbles onto a dead body. Who would have guessed?As Agatha does her own amateur sleuthing she quickly comes to the conclusion that one of her fellow hotel guests must be the killer.What really threw me off of this book was yet another character named Jimmy. First there is James Lacey her love interest, then there was Jimmy Raisin her first husband and now there is Jimmy Jessop, the handsome local police officer. For a person who reads this series, the over use of the same name is a bit of a distraction.Sir Charles Fraith reappears in this book and I have to say he is my most favorite character. His humor and chiding certainly keeps Agatha on her toes and a needed breath of fresh air to Agatha stodgy temperament.To keep Agatha's character moving forward you really should read the books in order, just be forewarned that not all books are as good as their predecessors.

This one didn't hold the same appeal for me that the previous two did.Connie MacIntyre, Connie Mac to her friends, a Martha Stewart type character, isn't the sweetheart that she pretends to be and when Connie is found dead in Hannah's pantry next to Hannah's Blueberry Muffins what's Hannah to do. She needs her kitchen back so she can finish baking for the Lake Edna Winter Carnival so Hannah doesn't want any other enterprising baker would do, she sets out to solve the crime.Quite a lot of goings on in this book that take away from the main story and "who-done- it" was such a secondary character that you had to remind yourself of who-was-that-person-again.In this book you learn a little bit more about Andrea, who turns out to be quite funny in her own scatterbrained way and poor Hannah just can't decide who her love interest will be, the cop or the dentist. One actually makes the decision easier for her, but Hannah really doesn't take no for an answer, especially when one is the man of her evening dreams and the other is the man for her day dreams.Even though this book didn't have a very good flow, I will continue on to the next book.

This movie begins in about 1585, when Elizabeth I is a bit more experienced with the debauchery that is surrounding her. She is about to face two of her biggest challenges: Mary Stuart and invasion by the Spanish Armada. Elizabeth is determined to keep the Papists away and keep her beloved England free from foreign domination.In walks the adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh, which does turn Elizabeth's head. He wants to continue exploring the new world, but needs the Queen's sponsorship. Unfortunately, her romantic dreams of him don't quite work out. But she does get Virginia named after her.This is a stunningly beautiful movie. I'm not fully versed in British history, but this beautiful movie had me riveted from beginning to end. The scenery, the wardrobe and the dialogue. It is definitely something to see. That is if you aren't too squeamish about that whole beheading thing.

Sometimes simple is best or so the story goes when Sarah McClure, an unfulfilled accountant, followers her new husband Matt to a small college town in Pennsylvania as he works on a crew as a landscape designer. Sarah struggles to find her place in this small town until one day she accompanies Matt to the crotchety Mrs. Compson's old family home.Sylvia Compson, a master quilt maker, does not make getting to know her easy; when she offers Sarah a job helping her to organize the old homestead for sale, Sarah takes up the offer with apprehension. As their friendship grows, Sylvia reveals the old stories and heartaches that surround Elm Creek Manor. While the women work together and quilt, a bond is formed and a future is developed for both Sarah and Elm Creek Manor.This book is a little too happily ever after for my tastes. Being the first in a series, I am sure that the characters will come more to life in future books, but I came away from this book feeling that Sarah, the main character, did not have much depth, so I found very little to draw me back to her. Because of this, I do not see myself continuing with this series.

In this 8th outing. Lori and Bill are summoned to Hailesham - Derek Harris' family home for a working weekend / vacation. Lori's knows that this will not be the relaxing vacation she had hoped for when upon their arrival a large topiary is set ablaze and poison pen letters start to appear. More is found out about Derek's family and Nell is still as irrepressible as ever. There was something very familiar about this book, like I had read part of it before. Very reminiscent of Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil.

Needing a break from her exhausting Christmas Holiday, Lori decides that a nice hike in the country will do her good. Unfortunately, an unexpected winter storm and her lack of map reading skills put Lori at Ladythorne Abbey with what appears to be two other stranded hikers. With Aunt Dimity's help, Lori finds out the mystery of the Abbey and discovers the ulterior motives of her fellow houseguests. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous, Aunt Dimity Takes a Holiday. Very little is mentioned of the steady cast of characters that make Atherton's books so charming and homey.

The office where I work has a "coffee club" which means for a set monthly price you get generic watered down coffee. Nope, that is not going to work. So in a workers revolt, a Keurig B60 Special Edition was purchased.To say that I love this machine is an understatement. Easy setup, ease of use, automatic shut off which make the safety team happy, 48-ounce removable water reservoir holds up to eight cups of water which is no problem because the "water club" and filtered water is literally two steps away. It is true, we seem to have a "club" for everything.The three size options work perfectly for our group. This way you can have the coffee as strong (or weak) as you would like. No more arguing over who used too many grounds and who will now be up all night because decaf is not an option. Really, you would think grown adults could learn to compromise.Finally, one less thing to complain about and now our conversations can move onto the more important things like - pens. No really, it is amazing how fussy people can be about writing instruments.Huh, maybe decaf would be a better option.

This book has been around for 50 years and still holds the magic of the first snowstorm of the season.In its day, this was ground-breaking work in that for the first time showed a young African American child putting on his snowsuit and having a glorious adventure in the first snow of the season.A sweet story that is as much fun now as it was when my children were young.

This is quite a funny laugh out loud kind of book. Sometimes you have to pay close attention because Troost will veer off the main subject but his antidotes are well worth the path that he is taking you down.When Troost and his girlfriend Sylvia find themselves with an education but no real job skills they apply for and are offered a government type of job on the Pacific atoll of Tarawa. This coral reef that is basically in the middle of no where is only the beginning of their troubles. Exactly how does one pack for a trip to an equatorial sandbar? Needless to say they were quite ill prepared for their lodgings, food and what the locals use as toilet facilities. Ok, that part was really funny.As Troost sets out to write the great American novel real life and death takes over and the reader is scurrying to find out what Troost and Sylvia will get themselves into next. With a great cast of characters and a wonder command of storytelling Troost is a writer to follow.

Chintz and China Series. 1st in the Series.Emerald awakes one night to find Susan Mitchell at the foot of her bed. Susan has to tell Emerald that she has been murdered by her husband. The authorities feel that it was an accidental death and now it's up to Emerald with her psychic talents and tarot cards to set the record straight.Nice twist at the end, but I could only give it a 3 because of the two ridiculous sex scenes that just didn't belong in a cozy mystery.

It seems as if only every other book in this series capture my attention. But at least we do know who was knocking on Stephanie's door.In this sixth outing, Stephanie is hot on the trail of a guy that killed his wife and has a general dislike for all woman; and since Stephanie does seem to be of the girl variety, this makes for quite an interesting adventure. If only Ranger was available, but unfortunately Ranger has a couple problems of his own. Most importantly, Ranger has skipped on his own bail and now has two amateurs looking for him in addition to the infamous Joyce.This comedy of errors only intensifies when Grandma Mazur decides to move in with Stephanie and Ranger makes a surprise visit.

This book has everything. Lesbian love triangles, mixed marriages, crooked real estate deals, a phony nanny scam, and a body in the fur vault. So, if you are missing your daily dose of soap opera's check out this book.Trocheck also known as Mary Kay Andrews, introduces us to J. Callahan Garrity, a retired cop who traded it all in for a cleaning business in Atlanta, Georgia. While taking on a new client, Callahan runs smack dab into ex sorority sister Lilah who is now married to a high rolling developer.When Lilah finds out about Callahan's experience in PI work, she hires Callahan to find their Mormon nanny who has disappeared with furs, jewels and very sensitive business information that the Beemish's are desperate to get back.The story goes from wacky to quirky rather quickly, but definitely not a story you have heard before. Great characters that will carry this series far. Characters are laugh out loud funny and I look forward to the next in the series.

Sometimes a narrator can really make or break a book. In this instance Nancy Wu just blew it for me. I can't stand whiney voices and though she is trying to portray a whiney self centered character she just took it too far.But -- the storyline, well that is different and the reason I added an extra star. The story is very well paced with a "don't know what's coming next" feel that has you laughing out loud.Not only is life challenging when you are named Elizabeth Taylor, but when you wake up after being hit by a car and you are in a coffin, wearing the ugliest clothes that your evil stepmother could dressed you in, life can only get better. Well, that is if you think being a Queen Vampire is better.Betsy isn't your usual vampire; she doesn't burn in the sun, can wear a cross and doesn't have to feed like the average vampire. This alone makes Nostro, the evil vampire leader, want Betsy dead, but with the help of a very desirable Eric Sinclair, they take on this dictator and total hilarity pursues.A wee bit adult at times, but still very funny and definitely a series to follow. But not on audio, I'll stick with the books.

I do not know what has taken me so long to write this review, I finished this book almost a month ago, but still I keep putting off the review. I love this series and I enjoyed this book, but when I sit down to write, I come up completely blank as to what to say. This is one of those series where it is so well written that you do not want to do it any disservice by writing a review and risking that your words will not translate and you will inadvertently turn a reader off.Walt and Katie are now back home in Absaroka County, Wyoming after a harrowing adventure in Philadelphia that left the Greatest Legal Mind fighting for her life and Walt reanalyzing the choices that he made while there. However, no day goes by without its challenges in their small part of the world and when the "bad things come in three's" saying rears its ugly head, Walt is faced with reliving his war years.When the body of a young Vietnamese woman is found along the interstate, Walt and his friend Henry Standing Bear, whom he calls the Cheyenne Nation, rehash their time in Vietnam. When an old picture of Walt is found with the dead girls belonging he must recall a case from forty years prior when he was an investigator in the Marine Corps and he realizes that ghosts don't stay buried for long.Told in a flashback style, the reader sees more of Walt's story. Who he was and how he became the man that he is today. Still told with humor, honesty and un-politically correct verbage, that is a trademark of Walt Longmire, he has me both laughing and cringing at the same time. Not to say that he is offensive, but in this day and age, it is hard to find either a person or a character that actually says what they are thinking without running it through social filters first.Please take the time to track down this series, meet Walt and his gang of wryly-funny personalities and enjoy a series that will take you on quite an adventure.

#2 in the Chintz 'n China Mystery Series. Things go downhill quickly for Emerald when a man leaves her shop after a reading and is killed by a hit and run driver leaving behind a small jade Ming dragon that has been cursed and disrupts the lives of those that are in possession of it. Unfortunately, little things in this book kept distracting me from the story. Doesn't Yasmine have an editor that would point out that you don't give a school nurse your insurance card or that you don't hear the "ringing" of the dial tone, even if this is a cozy mystery shouldn't an editor still do their job?

This is the first in the Inspector Thant Series originally published in 1981. Even though it is over 25 years old, it still holds up to today's standards.Inspector Like Thanet is called into investigate the brutal death of Julie a young housewife murdered in her own home. Though married, this beautiful woman had many men interested in her, yet she seemed to spurn them all. Digging further, Thanet finds many similarities to a murder some twenty years before when a then three year old Julie witnesses a murder. Thanet must decide if her past caught up with her and whether a conniving murderer plotted their revenge.This is a great series. Don't think you need to read them in order since I haven't and I don't seem to have missed anything.The books aren't easy to find but well worth the hunt.

I will be the first to admit that romances aren't my usual forte. I have always found them to be silly and repetitive, but for some reason, this book hit me just right, even though it all ends happily ever after with a dashing man riding into save the day. Does life really work out that way?No, I did not spoil the ending, all books in this genre end the same way.After the sudden breakup of her twentyish year marriage to her high school sweetheart and local pediatrician, Maddie Townsend find herself with no job skills and three children that need food on the table and a roof over their heads. Though no job prospects, she does have friends, and in a small town like Serenity, South Carolina, friends are what help you through this situation, even if it is their suggestion to open a spa and to date your son's baseball coach that is ten years younger and a whole lot more interesting then he should be.This is the first in the new Sweet Magnolia Series by Sherryl Woods, and though, as I said before, romance isn't my usual, Ms Woods has developed funny character's that find a way to get a job done even if there is a man to ride in and save the day. I guess that is what some look for in their reading, but for those of us who have never seen a white steed, that seems a bit far-fetched.

My mind kept wandering and I had to force myself to finish.Tom Ford couldn't make his payment to Lili Marino for a writing job she had done for him so she agreed to take his cottage in Walden Corners, N.Y. as payment. What does Lili know about country living? Very little, but she knows even less about solving the murder of Coach Johnson who she finds floating in a pond during the first day of hunting season.Coachs' family, wife Nora and son Scooter, were the first family to accept Lili into their small town so she feels that she owes them. Unprepared for the rivalries and animosity in a small town Lili is quickly in over her head in trying to solve this murder, but thankfully she has her gourd art to keep her centered.In this debut novel Bruce tries too hard to add too much to the plot; it would have been much better if she simplified and reduced the number of characters. I don't think I will continue with the author.

Warm Springs is a snippet of the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, played by Kenneth Branagh, who while being groomed for public office was stricken with polio at the age of 39. Roosevelt hears about a new "resort" with mineral rich pools that will restore polio victims. Roosevelt becomes enamored with the people and the rehabilitating affects of this rundown Georgia spa that in turn draws other polio victims to this backwoods area that inspire him to once again run for political office.I enjoyed this movie with a great cast of characters, including an outstanding performance by Kathy Bates, but in truth I think I enjoyed the series Franklin and Eleanor: The Early Years and Franklin and Eleanor: The White House Years better.

Originally, I had started reading these books out of order and decided that I would probably have a better understanding of who the characters were if I went back to the beginning. Well, apparently Ms Brown does a pretty good job in rehashing past storylines because I don't think that going back really changed my understanding of who anyone really is. So, with this series, you really can start anywhere and not be missing out on who all the main characters are.Crozet, Virginia, is a typical small town until its secrets explode into murder. Crozet, Virginia's thirty-something post-mistress, Mary Minor "Harry" Haristeen, has a bad habit of reading postcards not addressed to her. So when Crozet's citizens start turning up murdered, Harry remembers that each received a card with a tombstone on the front and the message "Wish you were here" on the back. So with the help of her cat, Mrs. Murphy and Welsh Corgi, Tucker, Harry sets out to find who is behind the murders and what else is being covered up.The only thing that throws me off of this series are the small sections where you can tell that Ms Brown is trying to make a political statement. I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I'm here to read a cozy type mystery, not witness the authors political views.Over all the series is pretty good, the reoccurring characters make the books enjoyable and the easy style that Ms Brown writes in allows the reader to come and go from the storyline - what I call a great "waiting for the kids" kind of book. Easy to pick up and put down without feeling that you have to go back a couple of chapter to remember where you were.

In this 3rd outing, Cleo opens up the Village Blend for New York Fashion week. On the evening of Lottie Harmons party Tuckers ex-boyfriend is poisoned by a drink that was intended for Lottie. Cleo takes it upon herself to prove Tuckers innocence only to get in the middle of something that is much bigger then she is. This story stumbles and twists along (with a couple of editing mistakes) until the twisted ending in which you have to be paying attention to get all the complexities. Not to mention whether Matteo is really wanting to change or not. I enjoy this series, the characters are familiar and it's nice to revisit them.

Most vampire stories tend to fall into the same rut, but surprisingly, this one stands on its own feet. Not falling into the same clich&eacute;s these funny and unique characters will keep you turning the pages.Sookie Stackhouse is a nave goodhearted southern girl minding her own business in Bon Temps, Lousiana when the vampires starting moving in. Being the south I guess that doesn't raise too many eyebrows, but when girls that start dating vampires, affectionately called fang-bangers are murdered, Sookie can't help getting involved.Then Sookie meets Bill and even she has to question a vampire named Bill, shouldn't they have more exotic names, and life gets even more interesting. See Bill's one of the only people that Sookie can't read. She calls it a disability; the ability to read other peoples minds, but how refreshing to actually find someone that isn't an open book to her. OK, Bill might only be a mid-level vampire, but she can work with that.Sookie's innocence really is what makes this book funny, well, that and having Elvis as a bodyguard, but over all, this is a very good vampire series. Good action, good dialogue and not your usual been there done that vampire thing.

After reading the first page I was ready to put the book away. The writing style didn't grab me. But after that I got into the books flow and was swept away with it. The tone is haunting and mesmerizing. The subject matter depressing. But it will stay with me as one of the most intense books I have ever read. Post apocalyptical journey of a man and boy across America to the West Coast.

There is something very magical about the illustration in this book. Natalie Babbit has blended a tapestry of medieval landscape with a very modern day twist of faces encompassing people that could have leapt out of your very own photo album.Like parents of today, the King and Queen are trying desperately to find what the "very best thing" is for their son the Prince. Their arguments have not been able to sort it out, so as the King looks through books for the answer, the Queen and her son journey through the kingdom in their own search.From vegetables to sleep, to sunshine, to songs, to talking, each person they come across has a different idea of what "the very best thing" could be. Having run out of reputable sources, the royal family comes upon the Cook's daughter. When she replies, "have you asked him", they family is shocked. What could this girl know?"The one and only very best thing is bub", the parents are at a complete loss. What does that mean, so off they go again trying to find the answer, when in fact, it was there the whole time, they just needed to ask and understand what their young son was telling them.I loved the Ahhh moment at the end of the book, where the explanation was so simple that I had to sit back and wonder how many times I had missed the obvious when I was raising my children.Read this book; take your time with the illustrations and the lesson that is being taught.

Lady Rose Summer returns in this second outing of Chesney's Edwardian Mystery Series. Rose is the spoiled daughter of the Earl and Countess Hadshire who is trying desperately to marry her off and since her failed first season, they are now considering either an asylum or India. Both seemingly will do the right job. But Roses decides to break the class barriers and go out into the working world with her maid Daisy. Being a typist seems interesting that is until she is forced to actually live off of her salary and not daddy's money. Well, low and behold a murder mystery falls into their lap and with the help of charming Captain Harry Cathcart, they all, Rose, Harry, Daisy and Becket, wind their way though an interesting group of blackmailer and blackmailees to a rather unique conclusion. Who knew you could blackmail a person for that reason; guess we all have something we must hide.Once the murder is solved, Rose still has that little problem of becoming engaged or being forced to India. How is she going to get out of this, since marriage seems to be the last thing on her mind.I enjoy this rather easy to read series. No complicated storylines or history to remember; an easy adventure with a cast of interesting recurring characters. This one also includes a little side story of unrequited love.

This one seemed to drag a bit for me. Even though Morelli was hotter than ever, the whole storyline was a bit slow.This time out Stephanie is tracking Maxine Nowicki, who's wanted for skipping out on a car-theft charge. But of course that is not the whole story and in walks the usual cast of crazies that usually inhabit Stephanie's life. Sally Sweet, a cross dressing drag queen, Sugar his kinda roommate, the wonderful Lula, hot Joe Morelli, the very mysterious Ranger, the pot selling vegetable guy, Grandma Mazur and Joyce who just never seems to disappear.Of course apartments are firebombed and of course another car is torched, but hey, this is Stephanie Plum and these things happen.The romance, or whatever you would call it, heats up between Stephanie and Joe is what kept me reading this book. Their "relationship" was more interesting than the mystery, if that is what you would call it.

A sports documentary that takes a different look toward disability through the eyes of the the USA Quadriplegic Ruby Team, also known as Murderball. Each player must have some loss of physical function in all four limbs but still able to navigate a modified wheelchair. The team is followed through their journey to the hardcore full contact venue of the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens Greece. Each player is introduced with their background stories and how this sport has empowered them. Some very unforgettable players and inspirational stories. Plus a couple of questions are answered as to their daily life with a disability. Very fascinating.

No matter what you think of Angelina Jolie's personal life, you have to admit that this woman can act. From the first scene of 1928 Los Angeles, to the final frame, I was captivated by this movie.As single mother Christine Collins returns from work, her nine year old son Walter is missing. The police department refuses her initial call, but eventually is willing to file a missing persons report. Five months later a child is found who fits a very loose description, but Christine knows that this boy is not her son and will not give up until her Walter is located.The corrupt police department refuses to believe her and begins to label her both a liar and a hysterical woman. Back in that day, when called hysterical, a woman would be locked up and treated to horrific conditions.With the help of a local minister, attorney and an investigator, all points converge on a ranch where a young boy tells a shocking tale of kidnapping, abuse and murder.There are a few continuity inconsistencies in the movie, but that should not take away from the story that this movie tell.The Changling, in part, is based off the true story of the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders.If you are interested in the full background story, please check out the Wiki page on this time Los Angeles history. A fascinating read.

If I would have known my publishing houses, I would have realized earlier that this is a Christian Fiction murder mystery. The book implies that it would be a cozy, with the mention of quilts, cats and tea, but I really didn't get that feel from the book.Thea James owns an Antique shop in a small town and when the local homeless man brings in a valuable Roseville vase with a list of women's names on it Thea is curious, but when two of the women are either injured or missing, Thea's investigation skills kick into full gear.The story is quite slow moving and is centered around Thea rediscovering her faith and finding a new man then in actually moving the mystery forward. The ending seems abrupt and convoluted. Didn't really appeal to me.

#13 in the Dan Rhodes series, but I don't really think that this is a series you have to read in order. I haven't and don't feel that I'm missing anything.Dan is Sheriff of Blacklin County, Texas with an odd group of deputies that make Barney and Mayberry seem normal.Bud Turley shows up one day with a very large tooth that he swears belongs to Bigfoot. Since he and his buddy Larry have been searching the woods since childhood, this discovery doesn't seem so out of place. But life isn't that simple and now Larry is dead. the Bigfoot Convention hits town and the body of a local boy missing for 10 years shows up.Sheriff Dan already has his hands full, if it wasn't for the feral pigs and snakes, this would just be another day in the life of a small county sheriff. This is a very funny quick read book, I recommend this series.

The Tooth of Time reads more like a travelogue of New Mexico than a murder mystery. I would say that you are about halfway into the book before the main mystery appears. There is a brief mention of a body in a yarn-dying vat prior to that, but it is quickly brushed over. It is not until the very end of the story, before you are told that the two murders that appear in the book are related.Maxie McNabb and her dog Stretch are once again on the road traveling in their Minnie Winnie and exploring the Southwest. They have stopped in Taos, New Mexico to check out a yarn store and perhaps learn a bit about weaving. After a brief encounter with a fellow shopper, Maxie is surprised when she is asked to visit the same woman in the hospital after an apparent suicide attempt. Being the good-natured woman that she is, Maxie visits and decides to take Shirley home until she can get her feet under herself again.Disappearing the next morning, Shirley leaves a trail questions and swarthy characters in her wake. Taos may not be a large community, but they do seem to have questionable people so when Maxie does not reveal what she may know about her houseguest, her poor frightened pooch is dog-napped until Maxie hands over the goods. Yes, it is that trite.Apparently, you do not come between a senior citizen and her traveling companion, so with the help of her new friends and a very convoluted story of conning and deceit that does not come to a full conclusion, you find yourself suddenly at the end of the book wondering if you missed something. I cannot say that I liked this book; I like my murder mysteries to be more about the bodies and less about the RV and its hiding spaces. Not to mention a satisfactory ending that does not have me scratching my head wondering if either there were pages missing or if Sue Henry got as frustrated with the storyline as I did and decided to put us both out of our misery.I recall enjoying the first book in this series, The Serpents Trail much more than this book. I will continue with this series and hopefully, the next book The Refuge will capture my attention a bit more.

Sookie Stackhouse isn't phased by much but when the body of a dear friend in found in the parking lot Merlotte's and she is asked to go to Dallas to help out the local chapter of the vampire guild, things seem to get a bit out of hand. Especially when you throw in a bar loving maenad.Arriving in Dallas with Bill at her side, Sookie sets out to find a missing vampire and bring him back to the nest. Sounds easy especially with her gift but of course she finds herself a captive of a church/fanatical group called the Fellowship of the Sun. Their main purpose is to destroy all vampires and those that are associated with them. Well, obviously, this puts Sookie in a difficult situation.This book actually has two storylines, the first being the Dallas part and the second being back home in Louisiana with the investigation around the death of Lafayette a cook from Merlotte's. Since Lafayette is found dead in the back of Andy Bellefleur's car, and Andy being a local policeman, things aren't looking so good. But true to Sookie's word of taking care of things, she is once again thrown into the middle of things and learning a whole lot more about her fellow neighbors of Bon Temps. But that fun loving maenad is there to help and Sookie may not be so judgmental if the raving mad woman can help her.A little bit more is discovered about the main characters. Harris does a wonderful job in slowly developing her characters and letting the reads know just enough to keep them coming back for me.

I am not usually a fan of girlie romance types of books, but sometimes the right book lands in your lap and you are really glad that you read it.Gracie McDougall is looking for something and it's definite not running a small luxury hotel in France, though she loves her job, she is looking for something that is missing and her mind keeps wandering to the small town of Seagull Point, Virginia. This town holds old memories for her, but she doesn't know if it's enough to keep her there until she stumbles upon a rundown Victorian that is just calling for her to turn into a Bed and Breakfast. That is if the difficult property manager would just listen to her plans.Kevin Daniels has no desire to let some upstart come into his town and try and turn his family home into one of those dreadful tourist traps. He has no desire to listen to her plans and definitely does not want his aunt anywhere near this beautiful charming woman.Well, as all romances lead in the same direction, there is certainly an attraction between the two and who knows what can happen with you mix business with pleasure.Sherryl Woods weaves a very entertaining story, mixing enough of the main plot with just the right amount of subplot to keep the reader involved in all the storylines. It is disappointing that this book wasn't the beginning of a series, I really think that Ms Woods was on to something really good. Maybe someday, but for now, this stand alone will remain one of my favorites books this year.

Great Discussion book. Great Book Period. This is one of the best books that I have ever read. My review doesn't do it justice, but that is just because I don't want to ruin this amazing book for you. Liz wakes up on a bunk in a boat not knowing where she is or how she got there. The shock of her life comes when she finds out that she is dead, the victim of a hit and run driver, and what's more important to her 15 year old self is that she will not turn 16 get her drivers license, go to college, get married or even get big [...]. This is a funny and heart-tugging book of Liz's journey through Elsewhere where she never gets older, but has an unexpected life and will grow younger until she is sent back to earth as a new born to experience life all over again. With the help of her grandmother that died before she is born, Liz makes this journey through anger, regret and triumph. It will definately make you look at the after-life in a totally different way.

When this book came up in a reading group, I was sure that I had read it, I love this series so when I went looking for my review, I could not find it anywhere. I was beginning to wonder if I had unwittingly skipped it.As soon as I finished the first chapter I knew the story, well, I thought I did. The beginning was familiar, the middle was a mystery, but the ending relit the dim bulb that I am now calling my mind and I am glad that I had reread it to remind myself how far Lori has come.Lori will always be attracted to men other than her husband, that does not mean that she would have disavowed her marriage, but what is a woman to do when there are attractive men coming to her aid and young (and old) love is in the air.Lori has been called in to evaluate a rare book collection at Wyrdhurst Hall located in the middle of nowhere Northumberland. Knowing Lori's sense of direction and driving ability is sketchy at best; the reader is not surprised to find Lori leaping out of her yellow Hummer just as it is being washed away in a torrent of water. What does surprise is that as Lori stumbles to safety and passes out just as she find a cabin, we next find her waking up naked in a strange man's bed.Being a Nancy Atherton book, we know that whatever Lori has gotten herself into is somewhat chaste. Lori does have a tendency to find perfect gentlemen that would never take advantage of the situation, but does not mean that she will not have some explaining to do.Newlyweds Nicole and Jared Hollander own Wyrdhurst Hall, a hall that is bound by mystery and ghosts. What at first blush appears as unsettled spirits looking for a little excitement is actually much deeper, and much more dangerous. Lori find letters dating back to World War I that spell out a doomed love affair. An affair that was manipulated by a mentally deranged man that would have done anything to keep an unworthy suitor from his daughter.As the story plays out, with the help of Aunt Dimity, Lori finds the secrets and in a netherworld conclusion, doomed lovers are reunited and a family haunted by its tragic past can now rejoice in a new and growing love.

This movie has been sitting on my shelf for over two months. I think initially, I was turned off because of the whole Indie thing. Independent movies never hit the right cord with me so on an "I am not leaving the house no matter what" Sunday, I popped it in.I loved this movie.There I said it; I actually loved an Independent Film.Jeff Daniels plays a foul-mouthed spiritual author who took over 10% of the G-O-D market by writing a book on the conversation that he had with the Almighty. Because of the fame and the zealots, he has lived a life of isolation. He has never spoken publically about his book; he has never opened himself up in that way. His publicist hates him, he hides action figures in a cabinet and is paranoid about anyone touching his piano. That is until he is in excruciating back pain and literally crawls into the office of a chiropractor and his world is opened up in un-expectant ways.I would hate to say that Lauren Graham and Lou Taylor Pucci are the supporting cast because they each hold their own and then some to Jeff Daniels. Each storyline -- of a single mother starting out on her own and a bookstore owner fresh out of rehab dealing with an alcoholic father - hold the same fascination as the reclusive author. Each person is searching for answers in a world that only offers more questions and challenges.This movie is very funny, very over the top in language and very sincere in the message of needing people to help us over our hurtles. In a way, we all need a Jeff Daniels / Arlen Faber in our lives -a man that does not have all the answers but sure knows how to give good insight when it is needed.

I'm not a big fan of V.E.R.B. books. Victim, Entitled, Rescue, Blame types of books, or people for that matter. So I surprised myself when I picked up Fly Away Home and read it in two days. This isn't your typical woman trying to find herself type of book, it's more of a woman trying to get back to who she was all along. I know that sounds like a slight twist of words, but all Sylvie Serfer-Woodruff wanted was to go back to the simple girl she was in college before Richard Woodruff swooped into her life and turned her into the perfect political wife.A fulfilling life should not entail having to stay twenty pounds thinner than when you were twenty and to fix your husband's breakfast plate while he runs off to do important work and you are left to struggle into yet another pair of stocking to give yet another unimportant speech to yet another group of self involved people.In one quick moment Sylvie's life is changed when Richard's extramarital affair makes headlines and she and her two daughters, Lizzie a recovering addict and Diana an emergency room physician - who is trapped in a loveless marriage, and beginning an affair of her own, all converge and with the strength of family these three women come through their own torment to find a strength and purpose that they didn't know had existed.Those who say you can never go home again have never had the blessing of actually going home. Going home to a place that is both a sanctuary and a respite. This is the gift that Sylvie has given to both her daughters and through them, to herself.I have never read a Jennifer Weiner book before, I didn't think that an offering like this could actually resonate with me, but I was wrong. I don' t know if all her books will hit me this way, but this was definitely the right book at the right time.

First in the Gourmet Girl Series by mother-daughter team Jessica Conant-Park and Susan Conant. Much in the venue of Cleo Coyle's coffeehouse mysteries, but this time in the restaurant business. A young twenty-something Chloe Carter is angered when she finds her supposed boyfriend with another woman so what is a girl to do, well, she goes online and finds what she thinks is her dream man, another food aficionado. Unfortunately, he has a few secrets of his own and is murdered before dessert arrives. Well, what is plan B--that would be falling for the head chef who just happens to be suspect #1. Life isn't easy, but it sure is delicious especially with all the food talk and recipes in the back of the book. Fun start to a new series.

Oh, what an adorable story. Told in a rhyming fashion, with a couple of miscues and using a couple of the same lines from T'was a Night Before Christmas, Jenny is preparing for first grade and is excited for her new adventure. Unfortunately, this excitement turns to anxiety as she learns that her best friend will be in a different classroom. Being the brave first graders that they are, they go their own separate ways only to discover that after making new friends first grade will be twice as fun.For ages 4 and up, this will be a good book to read together before the beginning of a new school year to help alleviate the anxiety of going into a big kid class.

As I live and breathe, that Agatha Raisin appears to be growing up. No longer is she endlessly chasing after James, or Charles or even the new man next door. Agatha is not doing anything as trite as trying to "find herself", but she is starting to come to some new realizations and her old irritating self is starting to wear off those rough edges and slowly, but surely, turn into a tolerable woman.In a deep slump after James joined the Monastery and Charles has run off and married a woman purported to be carrying twin; Agatha is left to her own depressed thoughts, that is, until a body is found floating down the river. Though the police call it a suicide - Agatha knows better and sets off to solve the mystery of the woman and why she was wearing a wedding dress and carrying a bouquet of flowers.Mrs. Bloxby comes into her own in this book; she is a character that I have always enjoyed for her never-ending insight and patience when it comes to Agatha and her harebrained schemes. Police Chief Budge is still completely flabbergasted by Agatha and the regular characters make their usual appearance, including the reverend and his endless frustration with "that horrible Agatha woman".The overall story is not that fascinating, but the characters are what brings me back again and again to this series. If you are expecting a thrilling and fascinating read, you will not find that here, but start this series at the beginning and you will find a parade of characters that never cease to entertain.

Considering how the prior book, Forever Odd, ended I was under the belief that Brother Odd would have centered more on the Elvis character, unfortunately, that was not the case. Once I got over my disillusionment, I found that I rather enjoyed this book. Actually, I'm really enjoying the whole series.Needing a break from Pico Mundo, and the place that holds so many memories of Stormy, Odd heads to the solitude of an isolated mountain monastery, but peace is not what he finds there. Lurking around the corners are supernatural beings, a quirky Russian and not to mention a rather reclusive mad scientist. With humor that is all Koontz, the reader not only finds himself entertained, but from time to time laughing out loud.Koontz's writing is never lollipops and rainbows, but he does bring humor and scientific wonder that has the reader wondering what is actually going on the writers head.Odd, to say the least is an interesting character and I do hope the Koontz can keep up the pace with this series. From time to time he has let me down, going too far afield with is imaginings, but this time and this series, he seems to have the right tone and feel.

In this very slow drawn out book, Little introduces us to his main characters, the Lowell Thurman family, mom, dad and three boys. Deciding they could afford the winter rates at the high end Reata Resort of Arizona, they pack the family off for a week of fun in the sun. Strange encounters and less then family atmosphere makes the Thurman's and other guest's question what is truly going on here.The hotel has a strange mind mend on those staying there, they forget, they hallucinate, they become highly sexual, they become barbaric. But leave it to a 13 year old boy to find the answer and save the day.By the end of this really horrible book I was repulsed. For a thriller it was even further out there than most. Too many barbaric scenes that had no point; and in turn made this book a joke. No need to read this author again.

I actually liked this one better than the first. Except for her over use of "as" and "like".In book #2 of this ongoing series, Claire joins a dating service that uses the Village Blend as a meeting spot. Good choice since she does meet the very desirable Bruce Bowman, but you know that Claire's life isn't that lucky, especially when her customers, and other dating service regulars, end up dead. With the help of the ever present Detective Mike Quinn and her never gone for long ex-husband, the trio set off to find the truth behind the murders. Quinn knows who the killer is, he just can't convince Claire who decides to prove him wrong.I highly recommend this series. Not too bitter, not too bold, a little nutty and leaves a good after taste.

First in the series. Great beginning to a new cozy series.State police detectives Brett Fortesque and Kathleen Somerville step in to aid the local police force in investingating the cyaide poisoning of two memebers of the Hancock Elementary School PTA.One dies at the annual PTA luncheon; the other is poisoned while sipping iced tea at the local Connecticut swim club. The investigation gradually reveals an unsavory aspect to the life in the suburbs and the PTA. Main character Susan Henshaw is the mom and PTA member that nails this great cozy.

I kept finding myself wanting to add plot lines and twists that the author didn't.After a life time of marriage, May List flees a philandering doctor-husband and ends up in an "active senior living" complex. Not only has her life ended up this way but she encounters a bizarre group of elderly residents that aren't exactly as they appear. After a bizarre encounter with the erratic Mrs. Berkowitz, May is warned to stay as far away from this woman as possible, but May's curiosity gets the best of her when Mrs. Berkowitz just happens to know the secret details of May's life.May starts putting the pieces together and finally see this woman as the blackmailer that she really is, the only problem is that it's a little too late when Mrs. Berkowitz is found dead and the plate of brownies that May had found next to her door is now empty on Mrs. Berkowitz's counter.It's up to the "Active Seniors" to solve the crime and get their secrets back.Parts of this book are very funny, but with the slow pace and pat ending, this book just didn't work for me.

Denton interprets a British ancestor's experiences in crossing an ocean and a continent to join the Latter Day Saints in Utah. Jean Rio Baker was, by Denton's assessment, a wealthy Victorian woman who "fell sway" to the message of Mormon missionaries in the 1840's. Not long after her husband dies, she packed up her children and other members of her extended family and embarked from England on the arduous voyage to Utah.Maybe it was her reality, but there seemed to be too much Mormon bashing in this book. It might have been that way, but as a biographer she certainly didn't take an unbiased view of the whole situation.

Apparently Ethan Black is a hit or miss kind of author and unfortunately this was a miss for me. Conrad Voort is from the first family of police investigators in NYC. A serial killer has decided that Voort is the reason why his life has gone from perfect to victim. The killer has planned 4 murders before midnight and leaves a note at each site that only Voort understands.

I am still very much up in the air about this book.In the past I have loved books by Linda Fairstein, but for some reason, this one just didn't come across as well. The storyline and the supporting characters felt rather flat, nothing really stood out in the storyline and I didn't feel the urgency that would be necessary for a book like this.In a case of mistaken identity, Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cooper has been reported murdered when a body fitting Alex's description is found in a car rented to her on a deserted road leading to the summer home of Alexandra Cooper - S e x Crimes Prosecutor.But it's not Alex, its Isabella Lascar, a film star that just needs a break from her life and some peace and quiet. Now the question is who was the real intended victim? As Alex combs her past cases to see who would be out for revenge and scouring Isabella's life to find the stalker that was writing letters and threatening call to her, the hunt goes on for the killer and the reason behind the murder.The ending is good, if a bit unbelievable, but overall, the book just didn't do anything for me. I will pick up other books by Ms Fairstein, because of past success, but for this one, I would recommend that you pass.

Unfortunately, some of these books are better then others.Elk Park School does everything it can to help their students enter the collegiate world. After one student prep breakfast, Goldie Bear, caterer extraordinaire, stumbles across the body of a student in the snow. This is not just any student, the is the class valedictorian, the one that everyone knows will be accepted to the college of his choice.The rich are different and when it comes to getting a child into a top school, there are no longer any rules and what should be a happy time in their child's life is suddenly turned into an all out competition with no hold barred.Goldie finds herself in the middle of the murder investigation, of course Tom Shultz is there too since he is trying to get closer to Goldie. But the investigation takes a personal turn when Arch is home alone and a rock comes flying through the front window and later someone blocks the chimney filling the house with smoke. And when that isn't enough to warn off nosey intruders, a second body is found.I'll continue on with this series in hopes that they get better, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. Hopefully, they will spark up soon.

I enjoyed this one a bit more than the last. The Agatha Raisin books tend to be a hit or miss with me, but the Wellspring of Death kept my interest.I do recommend that these books be read in order since the true plot, no matter what murder Agatha encounters, is really about the on again / off again relationship between Agatha and James.Agatha returns to Cotswold after her broken engagement to James, when she is approached to do the Public Relations work for the Ancombe Water Company who is trying to negotiate with the local council regarding bottling water from the village spring. Not everyone is in agreement with this idea and when Robert Struthers, who has not yet cast his vote on this decision, is found dead, snoopy Agatha just can't let a good murder or two go unsolved.With her usual cast of cohorts, she sets out to find out what is at the bottom of this. It doesn't hurt that a much younger man is interested in Agatha, its just what she needs to get James to pay attention, or so she thinks, since Agatha does have a tendency to misread the intentions of some men.The Agatha Raisin Series always seems to entertain me. Sometimes the plot lines drag a bit, but Agatha is always a source of entertainment and giggles. For being an independent worldly type, Agatha sure does have a problem with day in and day out relationships, not to mention her never ending bad choices when it comes to James.

As the title implies revenge is the theme of this book. When Cody Pritchard is found dead, Walt Longmire just knows that life is going to get complicated for his small town Sheriff's Department. Cody was a member of a gang of four that were arrested and tried for the sexual assault of a local Cheyenne woman - and when the men only received a light sentence the community was in an uproar, now that one of the golden four is dead, there are just too many suspects.Sheriff Longmire initially suspects the Cheyenne community and with the help of his good friend, Henry Standing Bear, who also happens to be a suspect, the investigating begins. Now if only Walt can keep his professional distance maybe a reasonable conclusion can come about. But with the death of his wife 4 years before and a mourning process that just won't end, a new love interest, an unbelievable cast of characters, both in his own office and the community, Walt just might get to the bottom of this mess. That is if his bathroom shower curtain doesn't repeatedly try to wrap him up like a human burrito.With a surprising ending and laugh out loud humor this is definitely a series worth continuing. And who knew, you can actually buy a helicopter out of the Neiman Marcus catalog.

She demand the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them.I love the mesmerizing story, but for me there was just one too many twists, namely where Vida came from. If only Setterfield could have come up with a better explanation, something more believable.

I loved how this story began - the 1940's feel with dames, Doll Face, and gams. The cozy genre rarely gives this type of atmosphere and the hard-boiled detective flare is a refreshing start to a new-to-me series.Penelope Thorton-McClure (Pen to her friends) decides to move to Qunidicott, Rhode Island to help her aunt keep open a small and not very profitable family bookstore. With the small inheritance from her recently deceased husband, Pen and her young son move to this out of the way hamlet in hopes of starting over and getting as far away from the wealthy and annoying McClure family as she can.Deciding that her money would be best used by expanding the bookshop into the area next door, Penelope does not realize that she has awoken a local ghost. Actually, this spirit is Jack Sheppard a 1940's detective that newly murdered author Timothy Brennan has been using as his inspiration for a fading book series.After the mysterious death of Mr. Brennan, Pen starts to hear voices, not just any voice, the voice of Jack Sheppard. It would be so nice if others could hear him, but of course it is only Pen and with Jack's help, they set off to find the killer of the annoying Mr. Brennan.Now, Buy the Book, is overwhelmed with the rabid fans of the recently departed author and all the weirdo's and crackpot are filling the store with their own illusions of the dead and if they can make a buck or two in doing so, then let the fun times begin.With the help of the disembodied voice, Pen puts together the wherefores of the mystery that surrounds them and with a small cast brings the events leading up to the murder to focus and therefore solving the crime in the brink of time to save her bookstore and to sell out all remaining copies of the dead man's books.The "why" of the mystery was easy to figure out, the how was unique, but the humor of 1940's Jack is what makes this book and will bring me back to the subsequent book in the series.

This one is quite laugh out loud funny. Rather embarrassing when you are listening in public. Lula may think that Ranger is a Super Hero, but I'll take Morelli any day.This time Stephanie is out to find "Uncle Mo" the well loved neighborhood candy seller. When the bodies of local drug dealers start turning up Mo is the main suspect. The book takes an interesting turn and it appears that Mo is up to a whole lot more than just selling candy.

In this 4th Hannah Swenson mystery, Hannah's mother finds a body in the basement of a home that is set to be demolished. Things get a little sticky when one of Hannah's Lemon Meringue Pies is found on the table with two slices missing with very little evidence of who was sharing the pie with Rhonda when she was murdered. The high school principal, guidance counselor and even the local reverend seem likely suspects.Once again the residents of Lake Eden, Minnesota aren't sure if Hannah is the culprit or the only one that can solve the crime. Seems drug store clerk Ronda Scharf had a couple of secrets of her own. Namely a bank robbery and missing money that has just started to show up.And now Hannah, with the help of her two sometimes boyfriends, Mike and Norman, set out to solve the murder. Once again the book seems more drawn around the romantic antics of Hannah, Mike and Norman with the mystery plot definitely playing second fiddle.For me this book was a little bit slower moving and not a whole lot going on as compared to the previous books in the series. Andrea is still ditzy with moments of brilliance, Mom is still annoying and Hannah who seems to be the smart reliable character can't get her personal life together, which for me is starting to wear thin. Not as fun as the love triangle in the Evanovich books, but an interesting break from hardboiled mysteries.

Other than hope that this series will improve I don't know why I keep reading. Every book is the same, the human characters are slow and the animals save the day. Really? At no time in Crozet, Virginia can you find a smart human?I have never read these books in order, but then again, I don't think that it is a requirement. The characters stay the same, the animals stay the same, only small portions of the locale seem to differentiate the books.This time the reader is taken to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello here the discovery of the human remains of a wealthy Caucasian male are found beneath the hearth of a slave's cabin.Harry, with her usual band of dim-wits, search historical records for some clue as to the identity of this man from the early 1800's. But not all involved in this matter want the truth to come out. Sometimes history should stay buried, but with a couple of cats and a corgi on the case, no human has a chance to keep their secrets hidden.Once again Rita Mae Brown has her political agendas stamped into this book. I just wish she would make up her mind if she wants to be a speech writer or an author of mysteries. If you want completely mindless reading and a heavy dose of the author's personal opinions and political views, I would suggest this series. Otherwise, head out of Crozet and into a town with a smarter human population.

She is lead to her daughters school where she finds a book that appears blank only to finds that it is a portal to tortured demonic souls. Just another day for Kate who has to fit this in-between getting her teen daughter to cheerleading practice, getting her 2 year old to daycare, and having dinner on the table by 6. But the twists to this book are what keep the story moving - the notes and quirks that bring back her memories of Eric, her first husband that was killed five years ago, her daughters teacher - who has a few secrets of his own, and Cool - the surfing phenom that has a sudden interest in San Diablo. Kenner is such a funny writer that you can't help but laugh out loud when a demon gets a ice pick through the eye.

I love Young Adult books, but this subject matter is heavier than most and doesn't fully explore the Self-Mutilation issue. Speaking in a first person account, teen Callie is in a mental care facility for treatment for cutting herself. She has stopped talking and refuses to participate with either her counselor or groups. With the threat of being turned out, Callie comes to the realization that to be healed, she must come to terms with her chaotic family life and heal some old wounds.

I usually don't like books like this, but once I got into this story and learned more about the strength of Helen an expert quilt and family matriarch; Helen's daughter Nancy, who has had quite the uphill battle to overcome her simple country roots; and Tessa, Nancy's daughter who has lost a daughter and is determined to keep the drunk driver behind bars. the more of this book I read, the more I adored the women that I have met and the message that they tell.Helen is now getting to the age where it's harder for her to take care of her home and her farm and when Nancy and Tessa go out for a visit they are shocked at what has become of Helen. Indomitable Helen just isn't able to do it all anymore, and when they arrive to discuss leaving her mountain home they are shocked at the mess the place is in. Helen has turned into a hoarder.

I was beginning to see a chink in the old Agatha armor and I do think that this book continues with this belief. She might still have tiny bearlike eyes, but they just might be softening a bit, thanks to the patience of the much-adored Mrs. Bloxby.While on vacation in Paris, Agatha is mugged and when Paris authorities have no interest in pursuing her assault she concludes that she could do a better job herself and returns home to open her own detective agency.James Lacey is still away and his cottage has a new owner, Mrs. Emma Comfrey has appeared in Carsely, and just as Agatha is getting her new detective agency off the ground, she realizes that a professional appearance would include a receptionist. Having tired of the usual sort that work as receptionists Agatha takes a chance on Emma, plus she can run down the errant cat or two and the agency will look more full service.What Agatha did not take into consideration was that Emma might have plans of her own and when she sees Agatha as an obstacle for Charles's affections, the gloves are off. Add this to the case that they are currently working on that includes the dead body of an IRA assassin on her kitchen floor and once again Agatha is in the middle of a murder investigation that has hit too close to home. She now needs to figure out if this is all tied to her first major case of the attempted murder of an heiress or if there is something more foul afoot.I adore Agatha, there is something endearing in the way that no matter how hard she tries or how honest her intentions are, something always go wrong and she is once again left with the utter fear of failure. If she could only understand that her friends do love and care for her - and if she would just stop trying so hard, things might just work out for her.

It never ceases to amaze me how I can love one series from a writer but not connect with other books that are written by the same person. For instance, Marion Chesney is also MC Beaton. I love the Agatha Raisin books, but there is something about the Edwardian Mystery series that does not work for me.Maybe it is something as simple as the fact that I do not like Lady Rose Summers. In the first book, Snobbery with Violence, there was a spark there that I liked, but as the series continued on, I lost interest in this woman and her silly goings on. Rose is still playing her games with Captain Harry Cathcart and the two have entered into an engagement of convenience. Meaning that she has told her parents that they are engaged only so they will not send her off to India.Being a failed debutant due to her intellect and unconventional ideas, Rose has to figure out this marriage thing - something that will give her a home of her own, but at the same time, not force her to be tied down with a husband and children. There is something about Captain Harry Cathcart, who has been around since book one, but since her family does not want their only child marrying a man in trade, other pickings are slim for Lady Rose.Rose is helping the beautiful Dolly Tremain in her very first debutant season. These are very treacherous waters for a young woman and when Rose sees Dolly about to make a horrible mistake she rushes to her aid only to discover that someone had murdered her and her body has been laid out to look like the Lady of Shallot.Soon Lady Rose's life too is in danger and with the help of Harry and a small group of friends, the duo ferrets out the goings on of the rich and famous and those that will do anything they can to be a part of that world.I have tried my best with this series, but just do not think that I can force myself to read the final book. I wish Captain Cathcart and Lady Rose Summer my best, but they will have to get along without me.

in 1866, 12 men, one woman and a child were exiled to Molokai where they were branded lepers and their lives were destroyed. Evenutally, this number grew to over 1,144. They were tortured, abused and used as guinea pigs by an ignorant government system that thought they were being kind in allowing them to live at all. With all of this there are many remarkable stories and humans that fought to make the best out of a horrible situation. This is a long story to read, the book drags on in parts and glosses over others. Very text-bookie in sections and repetative in others. I recommend the story and the historical significance.

Not realizing that this was part of a series and only being thrown off once when an old storyline was mentioned, I ended up liking this mystery involving the quirky people of Lickin Creek, Pennsylvania. Tori Miracle is a local news reporter and inadvertently discovers the body of Rodney Mellot who was a beloved music teacher that was thought to have run away with his bride to be. Unfortunately, this wasn't the whole story and Tori once again is in the middle of this mystery and has to reveal the towns secret. Midway through the book you are sure you know who-done-it, but keep reading, it's not what you think.

The ending is what makes this book unforgettable. Some have billed this as a children's/YA book, I think that this book is anything but. Told through the eyes of 9 year old Bruno the son of a Nazi Commandant, we see his burgeoning friendship with another child a Polish Jew. The only thing that separates them is a fence.Bruno's naivety is quite startling when you, the adult reader, can see what is around the corner. Bruno is just a kid, thinking kid thought, living in a kids world that has always kept him sheltered. But one day, reality will hit and with it a lesson is learned - an no one will ever be the same.I highly recommend this book to any adult and even to a middle schooler who is studying the Holocaust. This book gives quite a startling look at this time in history from a child's perspective. Though criticized for factual inaccuracies, that is not the point the book is trying to make. Whether it was Auschwitz or Bergen Belsen, it really doesn't matter. This is a story told though the eyes of little boys living in a grown up world.

That is the running theme in this 3rd installment of the Cedar Cove series. Rosie and Zack are the main characters this time. They have decided to divorce and the ordeal is quickly coming to a head with their children. Maryellen and Jon have decided what is in the best interest of their new born daughter; and Olivia and Jack have finally come to an agreement.More is revealed in the mysterious death at the Beldon's bed and breakfast with the divulging of an incident that Bob witnessed during his Vietnam years. Will this lead to the identification of the mysterious stranger? Are others still in danger? What is the full story?I enjoy this series, revisiting storylines and characters, just wish I hadn't waited so long in between books, forgot who a couple of people were, but Macomber is good at refreshing your memory.

And this might not be good news for Sookie.With the help of Alcide, sometimes you just have love the names that Harris comes up with, a werewolf, the antics begin in the search for the missing Bill.Though this book did seem to drag in parts for me, the interaction between Eric and Sookie is always entertaining and with Harris slowly revealing Eric's background I can see a much more entertaining character develop.

First off, I am not sure how to spell Malory. The cover of the book spells the name with one L and the written pages spell it with 2 L'sSheila Mallory, a middle-aged widow, of rural Taviscombe, enjoys her quiet life with a small band of friends that is until her friend Charlie Richardson, brings the quite chic Lee Montgomery home for a visit. Everyone had always thought that Charlie and Sheila would end up together, but sadly, that was not the case. However, Charlie respects Sheila's opinion and would really like for a friends opinion of his fianc&eacute;.When Charlie needs to travel back to America to tie up some business deals, Sheila agrees to check in on her only to find her dead. Well, Sheila takes her responsibilities as a friend seriously and decided that it is her job to find the who and why of the killing; and unfortunately, the more that Sheila digs the more she realizes that Lee definitely had a past and it could have been just about anyone who killed her.I enjoyed this book, though simple in its style, Ms Holt's writing is very much in the British style with subtle humor and many a leading culprit without overdoing the pitfalls that seem to be prevalent in most cozies mysteries today.

There just seemed to be too much rehashing of the previous books. If you have been reading this series from the beginning you already knew what Macomber was telling you in the first third of this book.Cranberry Point finally ties up the story behind Max Russell and why he died at the B&B.; Marriages and babies abound and a couple new love interests are sparked. And who would have thought that a dog and bachelor auction would ignite so much.Besides the repeating of old stories lines, this book hit me a little wrong with the tone of voice of many of the women. I just wish that they didn't sound so whiney and unsure of themselves. Even Olivia, the judge, sounds whiney and at times pathetic. Macomber needs to get back on track and give these women some more strength and backbone.

Still trying to figure out how a product containing coconut milk, coconut oil and egg white proteins can leave hair dry. You would think that with those ingredients it would leave your hair on the oily side. Not so with this product.Color treated hair comes out dry and in desperate need of a leave in conditioner. Even after using the matching conditioner, you will still need to seek out a leave in variety just so you can comb through and style.A product that I do not think I will be using again.Back to BioInfusion Hydrating Shampoo a great product for softness, shine and volume.

Imagine your husband taking a job transfer from dependable Greer, South Carolina to LeBelle, France. Now imagine taking your three young children, your English to French dictionary and your cat. The adventure only begins when you get there, meet your neighbors, learn the customs but you know you are home when September 11th strikes and your new French neighbors are there for you. And just when you think you are truly French, you find out you have so much more to learn. This is Rebecca's true adventure complete with quirky characters and laugh out loud moments. And don't forget Madame Mallet a grandma character that will rival anything Janet Evanovich can throw at you. There is a sequel being written that will encompass their first year back in the states, can't wait to read it.

When I first picked up this book, I saw the name Sue Henry and immediately remember the Jessie Arnold series that I had started last year and thought that this was another in that series. Well, no, I was wrong; this is a series that involves Maxie and her dog, a mini-dachshund named Stretch, traveling in their trusty Winnebago.When twice-widowed 63-year-old Maxie gets a call from an old friend living in Colorado, she decides that it is time to take a little trip. Sarah is her dearest college friend and since the diagnosis, Sarah realizes that she only has months to live and wants to see Maxie one last time.Unfortunately, someone has seen to it that Maxie and Sarah do not have a chance for a last visit. Sarah has been murdered and true to her nature, has left hidden clues for Maxie as to her final wishes and secrets that have been kept hidden.The storyline progresses incrementally revealing little bits and pieces until the reader gets the fuller picture of whom each character really is and the true character of the killer is revealed. What I enjoyed about this book is that the reader had to follow along and not be misled by outward caring of one character and the aloofness of another. Like many books in this genre, not everything is easily laid out and you do have to pay attention.Of course, I will continue with this dynamic duo. Who could resist a feisty woman and her trusty dog companion traveling by themselves? Part travelogue, part mystery, this series should take the armchair reader to interesting and varied destinations.

British police procedural featuring Inspector Luke Thanet. This is the fourth book in the series, but it's not necessary to read them in order.15 year old Charity Pritchard is found dead in an alley near her home. When Thanet and his less than confident assistant Sergeant Lineham begin to investigate they find quite an unusual cast of characters. Charity and her family belong to a very strict fundamentalist religious group who deny their members things such as jeans and make-up. Well, Charity being a bit rebellious decides to venture into this teen world. Thant sets out to find out of this form of extreme parental repressiveness is what lead to Charity's death.This book kept me drawn in until the end. Thanet's character thinks outloud so you are brought along through his thought process and not left with an unlikely surprise. Thought I had it figured out early, and then began to question myself. Good use of characters and quirky personalities. Very much in the Agatha Christie realm.

Enough already with the metaphors, similes and idioms. I get it.In this laborious story, Kate Conlon, a former FBI agent and currently a child advocate is brought in to help a young witness identify a man, the Cremator, whom she saw in a park late at night setting a body on fire. As this very long story goes, it gets quite twisted as to who are the good guys, who are the bad guys and which characters are brought in to confuse the story even more.When the third victim of the Cremator is identified as the damaged daughter of a billionaire the big guns are called in, in the form of Special Agent John Quinn, who just happened to be the ex-lover of Kate. One more twist. And of course, now Kate's life is in danger.The only thing that kept me reading was that I couldn't figure out who the Cremator was; too many major and minor characters were thrown at you in hopes that something would stick and lead you down the wrong path and yet again you would be bouncing back and forth with possibilities.I don't think I will be reading this author again since about one-third of this book could have been removed and the story would have flowed much better and as an experienced author, for me, she just couldn't keep up the momentum.

In this HBO miniseries of Richard Russo's novel, Ed Harris plays an unpretentious restaurant manger that shows us his life within a small economically depressed Maine town. While trying to keep the doors of the Empire Grill open, he must deal with an ever increasing cast of characters - from Joanne Woodward, the town matriarch to Paul Newman - his curmudgeonly wayward father, to his ex-wife Helen Hunt (who does not pull off the accent very well). Ed Harris shows the traumas and realities of his everyday life while coming to terms with his past.I never did read the book which some swear is better, but this gem of a movies, with its beautiful scenery and amazing cast of characters is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

I think that my brain checked out somewhere in the middle of this book. The beginning concept of the book, embryonic transplant cells to cure or alleviate Parkinson's disease, is in itself an interesting concept. That is where the good part of the story ended. Why Dr. Cook needed to throw in the Mafia and a religious angle made no sense. Neither of them was fully explained and neither of them added to the overall storyline.In what is purported to be a collision of power, religion and bioscience Dr. Cook takes the reader down the road with Dr. Daniel Lowell who is trying to develop the HTSR technique that involves replacing damaged DNA with replacement healthy cells. Where and how they get these cells might make a reader angry, but that is what biomedical controversies are built on. When Dr. Lowell runs into a roadblock by the name of Senator Ashley Butler, he thinks that his medical advancements are doomed. That is until Senator Butler covertly asks to be his human guinea pig.Somewhere in this long drawn out book is an interesting plot. Unfortunately, Dr. Cook throws too much in and dilutes all the interesting parts. I suggest that you pass on this particular book and check out some of his others. He seems to run hot and cold in his reviews, but there are good ones out there.

If you have been a victim of child abuse, do not read this book. If you are sensitive to this subject matter, do not read this book. Many times I knew that I should have put this book down and taken a shower, but it just kept drawing me back in. Definitely a book that will stay with me a long time. A horrifying tale of abuse of a young girl at the hands of the neighborhood children and her own relatives. While the subject matter is hard to deal with, Ketchum's writing is wonderful and really makes you turn the pages, whether you want to or not.

Though better than the previous one, this series is just getting too syrupy for me. And if Macomber is going to have a teenager as a character she should never have them putting on a housecoat - a robe, a cover-up, but nothing that sounds as old as something that their grandmother would wear.This book covers the lives of Corrie and Roy, the local private investigator that have been receiving gift baskets and postcards with subtle messages. Seems that there is a little secret in their past that has now surfaced. Not too surprising, but most of the book is then tied up too neatly.In the past I have enjoyed Macomber's books as a nice break from harder edged things, but the last two just make the women sound too much like victims to the whims of the men in their lives.But, if you like your books with whipped cream and a cherry on top, well then, this is for you.

This book exposes the brittle line dividing the haves and the have-nots in this disturbing yet strangely intriguing story set in the hallowed halls of St Oswald's, an aristocratic British boys' school hovering on the edge of extinction. I can't really tell you why I liked this book, but it had me from the beginning and I was disappointed when it was over, because I really cared about the characters, even the ones that I shouldn't have cared for.

This book chilled me from the very beginning. I cannot say for sure if it was the storyline or the location, but the brutal killing of a couple in a remote farmhouse in Sweden, still makes me shutter.At 5am on a January morning, Ystad police inspector Kurt Wallander is called out to investigate a murder. After a neighbor senses that something is wrong, he notices a window open on a neighboring farm. Going over to investigate he finds one man brutally beaten to death and a noose around a woman's neck. As the farmer approaches the dying woman, she utters one word "foreign".Battling his own demons, a father with dementia, a family life in ruins and a town where anti-refugee feelings are running high, Wallander needs to solve this case before the whole situation blows up in his face. With little to go on and sheer determination, he sets out to solve this mystery.Faceless Killers will have a very specific audience. The characters are not overly likeable, the harshness of the country is not enchanting, the storyline is very slow - and by the end, you do not really care about the "who" of the "whodunit. You will plod through and investigation with a depressed investigator who is determined to find a solution only because there is nothing else in his life.Maybe there was something lost in the translation, but this book had very little to offer me. I picked it up, I put it down, took almost 3 weeks to read it. No spark, no humor and a conclusion that seemed to come at the right time to put us both out of our misery.

Mary Grace Winters had to reinvent herself. There was no other choice after her abusive cop husband threw her down the stairs for the second time causing her extensive injuries. Finding a safe house and a friend, she and her son change their identities and became Caroline and Tom Stewart and a new life began. She goes back to college, finds a secretarial position in the history department and when her mentor suddenly dies, in walks the new department head, the handsome Max Hunter. But little did Caroline know, her husband is not totally out of the picture.As their love grows and their literal scars are shown, Caroline's past life reappears and both she and Max are in for the ride of their lives. No past is left buried for long, but with the love of friends and family there is nothing that they can't face together. Not even a brutal wife beater.I can't call this a fun book, but it does keep you turning the pages. Rose handles the topic in an honest way without it being preachy and the intimate scenes are warm without being too mushy. I enjoyed the book and will continue on with this author.

First in the Anna Pigeon Series. Years ago I was told that this was a great series, but I just didn't believe the person who told me. Guess I should have. Anna is a National Park Ranger and when two of her fellow rangers have mysterious deaths Anna investigates, almost gets herself killed. Anna will question many things in her life, but she makes for a great character.

I am so glad that I went back to this series. The first book, Track of the Cat, was very good, but I am beginning to think that I liked this one better. Nevada Barr has a way of drawing in the reader in from the very beginning and holding your full attention straight through to the end. Even if you think you have figured out where she is going, you still hold on to each word in case there is something there that you might not have picked up on in the beginning, but you are darn sure you want to know in the end.This time Anna Pigeon has been reassigned to Isle Royale in Lake Superior, hence the name, where one of her assigned duties is watching over the Kamloops, a vessel that sunk in 1927 with 5 sailors on board. Well, that is what she has been told, but up comes a diver swearing that there are six men down there. Now Anna is not a big fan of deep diving considering the fact that if you come up too quickly the closest decompression chamber is two very painful hours away. That is if you do not die in the mean time.Yep, there is an extra body down there and why is he wearing an old-fashioned sailor's uniform. Darn, the peaceful summer with the entertaining wildlife and the adventuresome scuba diving tourists just got a whole lot more troublesome.This is not the only story going on. Nope, that would be too easy for Anna. You also have the missing wife of a fellow ranger, you have a head twisting "what did you say" relationship involving Hawk and Holly who are members of a dive team and you have a young incorrigible named Carrie Ann who keeps sneaking off to the utter frustration of her mother.I know it sounds like a lot to keep track of, but Ms Barr writes each character so clearly that the only confusion that I had was which boat belonged to whom.Without being repetitive, there are occasional get-caught-up sections where things are re-analyzed, much in the thinking aloud concept where the reader says "oh, that's right, that makes sense". The who-done-it part is not apparent from the beginning and the reader is lead down many different paths as Anna herself is trying to figure it all out at the same time.I really enjoyed this book and I will definitely move the next in the series up on my list. The books are not deep, but they are twisty so you will have to pay attention.

After an animal lab technician finds a partial corpse in the Hughlings Jackson Center for Neurological Research (aka "Hugs"), police lieutenant Carmine Delmoico discovers that this murder is only one of many -- with more to come -- committed by a meticulous serial rapist/killer who saves the heads of his victims.Even thought this sounds creepy, the creepy part for me didn't happen until the very last page.Great book that has you thinking the whole time. Just when you think you have it, you might, but there is enought to keep you wondering.

Well winter is over so it is time to put the coffeemaker away and checkout the tea collections.Not sure if I wanted iced or hot, I was looking for something that was either and not the same old, same old. Blueberry, now that is different, can be good either hot or cold. Well, that worked for me since I tend to get caught up in a book and the tea turns cold before I know it.I do not add sugar since I like tea just the way it is. I did find that with True Blueberry, if you steep for too long, the overall taste become bitter and a bit hard to take.As I have been reading, the trend now is to combine flavors and come up with you own concoction. I am thinking that his just might work with the blueberry. Teavana matches blueberry with a pineapple. That could be interesting.Well, back to this product. I see that there is a complaint about Soy Lecithin so off to review that issue. Apparently, there is no real problem with this ingredient unless you are allergic to soy. Therefore, I am here to tell those with a soy intolerance - please stay away and read tea labels prior to consumption since this is a relatively new ingredient to the Celestial Seasonings line.In addition, while blueberries are known for their antioxidant capabilities it has not been proven that all the health benefits associated with blueberries are equally present when the blueberries are consumed in tea. So with that being said, Celestial Seasoning True Blueberry tastes great and if you just happen to get an extra dose of antioxidants, well, the more the better.

You've got to love a woman who refers to Eleanor Roosevelt as Ellie. The irrepressible Paula Deen comes through in this book like the funny approachable woman that you see on TV.With what seemed to be insurmountable problems, she managed to pull herself up from her bootstraps and go on to create a safe loving home with the financial security that she had always dreamed of for her boys first and then herself.After marrying the wrong man and battling years of agoraphobia, Paula decided that enough was enough and with the begrudging help of her boys started a small catering business that has turned into a multimillion dollar empire of restaurants and TV shows.But she will be the first to admit that if it wasn't for family, it just never would have happened. Family love is first and all else is just fried chicken. I highly recommend this book for its inspiration and humor. You will laugh your way through it.

Second book in the Susan Henshaw series.Susan is days away from her 40th birthday when she find out that Dawn Elliot, the neighborhood tramp, is moving back to town and all of Susan's insecurities resurface when she once again must be reminded of her husband affair with the woman. But Susan has other things on her mind as well, including the "surprise party" that he husband is planning - but that whole thing doesn't work out so well when Dawn's dead body is found behind the steering wheel of the brand new car that Jed bought Susan for the big 4-0.With the help of her friend Kathleen, an ex-detective, the two set out to solve the mystery of Dawn and the men she was involved with, including a strange husband, but this book quickly dissolves into naughty neighborhood goings on and storylines that could only be described as soap-operaeque. I don't know why I continued on with the series, other than its throw back to kinder gentler days of Dallas and Knot's Landing.

Agatha is a never ending source of entertainment for me. From storyline to storyline she manages to get herself in one jam after another with pretty much the same outcome. Though that sounds redundant, MC Beaton makes the books entertaining and at times downright laugh out loud funny.Agatha should never be left to her own devices, when she is bored things go from bad to "Oh, Agatha" very quickly. So when James is out of the country, Bill is on vacation and Charles is a bit stand offish, Agatha decides to head off to Evesham and visit the wonder Mr. John, a salon owner who has a way of working miracles.Agatha gets a bit more than she bargained for when Mr. John starts putting on the romantic moves, y nature Agatha is a big apprehensive, and when Mr. John collapses in his shop she grabs his keys and heads to his home to find out what this man is really all about.Is he really the blackmailer that everyone seems to believe he is or is there something or someone else actually pulling all the strings.As the story comes to light, Agatha once again has the fame and glory pulled out from under her and must return to Carsley with a rather fantastical tale and no way of proving that it was actually she who solved yet another case for the police.Agatha just needs to face the fact that no good deed goes unpunished and no matter what she does to get James attention it is just going to backfire on her which is what, in an absurd way, makes me come back to these books time and again.

This is an OK movie, not great but something nice to have on in the background while you are doing your stuff around the house.The movie is formulaic with the typical best friends helping a grieving widow. After having been married for 20+ years, Arvilla has lost her husband. One of his dying wishes was to have his ashes spread over the places that he loved; this does not sit well Arvilla's stepdaughter who wants her "daddy" to be interred next to her mother. Throwing salt in the wound, if Arvilla does not comply, nasty stepdaughter will take the family home away from her.Instead of flying from Pocatello, Idaho to Santa Barbara, California they decide to take the late husband's Bonneville on a cross county excursion stopping in the places that dear dead husband enjoyed. Funny, apparently there are no freeways from Pocatello to Santa Barbara since they seem to be in some rather out of the way gas stations.After arriving late for the funeral with guilty looks on their faces, the ashes are finally presented to wicked stepdaughter only there is quite a funny surprise when the ashes are accidently spilled. Actually, that is the best part of the movie.There are a couple of things that just did not make sense in this movie - Why was it necessary to make reference to a characters Mormonism when in fact they just made fun of the customs of that religion throughout the movie. How did the truck driver find them at yet another out of the way gas station driving a little blue truck instead of his 18-wheeler?The little things here and there drove me crazy. I guess if you are looking for mindless entertainment this would suffice, but if you are hoping for something to dig your teeth into, this just is not it.

OK, I will give it to Kate Atkinson; she has a way of zinging an ending where you do not see it coming. There is always something at the end that makes your head do a whip-a-round and you find yourself saying, "Really, what did I miss that got us to this point".If you are one of those cheater types that reads the last chapter or paragraph before you start a book, then you will ruin this whole reading experience, so just take your time and get to the good parts in due course.Like the previous book, there are multiple plotlines - an automobile accident with a brawl in the middle of the street; a home developer and his wife who have a problem with deceptive business tactics not to mention missing money; and then there is Jackson Brodie, the former cop and private investigator who while in Edinburgh to see Julia in a play discovers a body. Of course, this body cannot stay put and washes out to sea before the local constable can come to verify its existence, making Jackson look like a daft fool.As the stories weave their way to the conclusion, the reader begins to see how each are interrelated. How even the slightest nuance actually has a point and the dry humor that is exhibited in the unlikeliest moments has you rereading wondering in this politically correct day and age if they can really say that.Overall, I don't think I liked this book as well as the first Jackson Brodie, Case Histories, I just couldn't find myself attaching to the characters in the same way as I did the first time around. Though the writing and the stylizing of the stories are good, the overall enjoyment of One Good Turn was not the same as Case Histories. Will I read more, maybe one day, just need to take a break and wait until the feeling hits me again.I do suggest that you read them in order since some of the characters flow from one into the next and you might feel that you are missing something even though Ms Atkinson does an admirable job of rehashing some bits from the previous story so you do not feel completely in the dark.I do recommend that you do check out this series, from the beginning and be prepared for an enjoyable time and a thinking person's adventure into storytelling.

Now I understand that when you read this genre, you have to take a giant step away from reality, but when a caterer kidnaps a jail inmate while she is being transported to a medical facility - not all should be forgiven just because your husband is a member of the local police department.That really was my only complaint about this book. I enjoy Goldy Schultz and the crazy antics that she gets herself into. Really, who else is called to cater a company luncheon in an old mine that four wheel drive vehicles have a hard time getting to but her old trusty catering van has no trouble with. Goldy really does have the golden touch, not just with food, but apparently with terrain also.Goldy's best friend Marla is now out of the hospital after suffering a heart attack and has invested in the Eurydice Gold Mine. On a deeper look, boyfriend Tony Royce and financial advisor Albert Lipscomb may have something to hide. When a fraud is discovered and the partners are missing, Goldy rushes to her friend's aid, but this time Goldy may have gone too far and has managed to put not only herself, but her loved ones as well, in great danger.In this book, you will say goodbye to one character and hello to another. I will miss one, who always brought a smile to my face and will I withhold judgment on the new addition. There is real potential in this young man, but we will see where Ms Davison goes with him.Once again, I suggest that you start this series from the beginning so you can appreciate all the quirks that are Goldy. She is quite an endearing character, and one that you will enjoy coming back to time and time again.

What if Buffy the Vampire Slayer grew up and had to fit demon slaying into her busy schedule of being a wife and mom. Funny premise and a great beginning to a new series. And of course there is an older grandfather figure that just makes you laugh. Gives Stephanie Plums grandmother a run for her money. I look forward to the second book in the series.

Apparently, everyone has a secret or two, so discovers Sheila Malory while she is at the Bodleian researching data for her upcoming article on little know Victorian authors; and meeting up with old friends.The rather unpleasant Gwen Richmond was discovered crushed under an avalanche of old books. How could that have happened on its own, things like that don't just happen. But then again, Gwen was a blackmailer, so I guess something's are possible. Delving into Gwen's past, Sheila uncovers quite a few irregularities and with the help of an old journal, the truth soon comes to light.Unfortunately, not all of the truths that Sheila finds on this trip bring her the peace of mind that she was searching for. Sometimes it's best to keep our past the past and hopefully, the future won't be tarnished with the unscrupulous deeds of others.I enjoy these older cozy mysteries; they aren't clog up with over the top stupidity that seems to be prevalent in the genre day. Sometimes the writer will wander off the course a bit, but that's OK because there aren't pets with above human intelligence or a man rushing in to save the day. The stories stay true to what a good old-fashioned mystery used to be.

At the age of 2, Olivia was kidnapped and her parents murdered. Ransom was demanded, paid, and she was found wandering a mall. Flash forward 25 years, a suitcase is found behind a wall with a tiny skeleton and a tell tale sign that this might be Olivia. Confused yet? Well, a Sealy family trait of an extra thumb was visible on both Olivia and the skeleton that was found. But if Olivia was returned, then who was this baby. Has Olivia's whole life been a lie?In comes Det. Trey Bonney of the Dallas Police Department. He also happened to be Olivia's high school love. The story gets very twisty with side stories that don't really make sense or have a point and are never fully explained. Abortion clinic bombing, neighbors house broken into, wayward cousins, etc.In the end, this compilation of characters each reveals a small part of the story which leads to a very unlikely conclusion. This is my first McCall book and I can't say that I didn't like it, just wish she would have left parts out and tightened up other storylines. She has talent, just lacked direction on this one.

Well of course, you would not expect a bunny to have a chocolate rabbit - would you?It is egg-hunting morning and Max and Ruby are out early wanting to win the grand prize of the chocolate chicken. Ruby explains that the person who finds the most eggs gets the chicken. Easy-peazy, or so it seems.Why looks for eggs when there is so much more to see like mud puddles and acorns. As Ruby gathers eggs, Max finds spoons and ants.Max still wants that chicken but has a plan that does not involve looking for eggs.Not a very good plan and I am sure that parents will have a hard time explaining to their young children how you can have a happily ever after ending when stealing is involved.The illustrations are colorful and engaging, just not sure that the overall theme is something that most parents would want to read to their children.

Very boring and I had to work exceptionally hard to keep my head in the game, but the very end was quite creepy and almost had me wanting to give the book a higher rating.Zoe Hayes, the lead character, lives in an upper class close-knit Philadelphia neighborhood where the local nannies begin to disappear. Zoe, an art therapist in a mental hospital, and her daughter are quickly thrown into the foray when Molly finds a human finger in the snow and with this clue, Zoe knows that the serial killer has to be one of her neighbors.I know a huge jump in the storyline, but pretty much this is how it happened. Of course, you have to throw in the police detective that will make their lives complete and then when the killer is found and the trumpets blare they will all live happily ever after. Unfortunately, that is where the creepy part comes in. When your mom works in an institute for the seriously deranged, part of her work might come home with her and a Steven King-esque twist appears just when you were not expecting it.

It appears that Agatha has put on her big girl panties and she is no longer going to be ex-husband James Lacey's doormat. He cannot suddenly appear in her life and on a moment's notice assume that she is going to drop everything and follow him on a whim.OK, well maybe after this one trip.After seventeen books, we all know Agatha pretty well, she puts on a strong face, but deep down she is desperate for a man's attention, even if the said man of the moment does not treat her very well. This time it is going to be different, James has unexpectedly arrived on her doorstep and wanting a traveling companion for his next assignment, as a travel book writer, he has invited Agatha on holiday.Unfortunately, the idyllic resort that James remembered from his youth has seen better days. As James is remembering a perfect vacation from his childhood, Agatha is seeing an old hotel crumbling into the sea. She wants to go home; she wants to be back in her garden with her cats.Agatha is devastated at the turn of events and showing her disappointment, takes her anger out on a fellow guest. The next day when said guest turns up strangled with Agatha's scarf the police quickly jump to their inept conclusions and arrest Agatha. This cannot be happening. Unless she can get to the bottom of this fiasco, she will be spending the rest of her days in a cell in a pathetic little town.Luckily, for Agatha, there is no shortage of suspects and the reader has to pay attention as to who is related to whom. What motivation each of them has and will a most fortuitous glimpse into a draw blow the case wide open.For me, once again, Mrs. Bloxby is the perfect character in this book. You can see her growing and having more fun than the typical lot of a vicar's wife. In a way, I think she lives vicariously through Agatha and at the same time, has the astute insight that keeps all of the townspeople of Carsely in line.

I adored this YA book. 14-year-old Miri loves her life with her father and sister on Mount Eskel, where she spends here days taking care of their home while her sister and father work in the local quarry mining the very beautiful and rare linder stone.Miri longs to be able to actually work in the quarry, but being born early to a mother that died six days after Miri's birth, she just isn't large enough or strong enough to the the physical work that is required.Miri's life is about to undergo a dramatic change when the prince announces that it has been foretold that he will find his future wife on Mount Eskel. Such a twitter abounds and all girls between the ages of 13 and 18 are sent off to the Princess Academy where they are taught the fine art of being the perfect princess. The girls were excited about this until they meet their tutor, the horrible Olana who feels that it is her personal duty to torture these young women all in the name of propriety. But Miri and her band of friends have something entirely different in mind and with the help of "quarry-speech" events turn out quite differently when one of the quarry girls has a shocking confession of her own.Though this book is suggested for ages 9 and up, I think that 9 is a bit too young and that this book would be better appreciated by girls in the 12 to 14 year age group. A little exciting and a little early romance make this a fun book to explore and to share with your daughters.

#7 in the Series. In this outing, Lori returns to Finch from a 3 month visit to the states only to find that the horrible Prunella "Pruneface" Hooper has been murdered. With the help of Nicholas, the nephew of the vicars wife, they set out to find the secrets of their little town and to find out who "didn't" have a motive. Everyone in this idyllic village has a secret, but it's up to Lori and Nicholas to keep their secrets but to also solve the crime with some help from the wonderful Aunt Dimity. I enjoy the theme of Atherton's books. They are just the right amount of cozy.

For me, one of the greatest parts of a cookbook are the pictures, I tend to read with my eyes and stomach before I look at the ingredients and the techniques so I am psyched up to try something new. This book was a big letdown. Other than the cover, there are no pictures. Not even a center section where you can go back and search out the recipes when the picture entices you.Darn, I was hoping for so much more.I did come across a couple recipes that sound good, but now the dilemma lies in cooking times. What I need are recipes that I can quickly throw together in the morning before work and eleven hours later when I return, the food is ready. Many of these recipes have cook times of two to three hours. That sounds more along the lines of something that you would put together after school and before you rush out to sports practice. Short cook times are not practical for me.The cookbook covers the usual soups and stews with a couple breakout dishes. Most recipes call for usual pantry and freezer fare, so in that regard, there is no stress in the slow cooker recipes mentioned in this book. The quantities are small since this is a cookbook designed for two, so make sure that you have a 1 - 3 quart slow cooker.Long story short, if you are looking for small quantities with short cook times, then check out this book. If not, do as I do and keep looking. There has to be something out that that solves all of my slow cooker issues.

Our small town is in a dither because our local theater group is going to put on this play. So I decided to read this book to "be informed before I judged". I'm so glad I did, this book wasn't what I thought it would be. With humor, wit and sadness, Eve takes us on a journey of pain and pleasure through our "down there parts". I don't think I will ever wear my "I love my Vulva" t-shirt. But it's nice to know that others do.

With one reservation, I will say that I enjoyed this book. Because the tale is for ages five and up, I am not as concerned as I would have been if the book were designed for younger children.Mosquito is a talkative little guy; he loves to tell his friends what he has seen that day, well, Mister Iguana has had enough of the babble and decides to put two sticks in his ears so he does not have to listen to such nonsense. Thus setting off an unforeseen chain of events.Maybe I am overprotective or want there to always be happy moments in a children's book, but I truly wish that this tale did not contain the part about the owlets. I understand that the meaning would be lost and the opportunity to teach young children about cause and effect would be missed, but as I said, I am a bit sheltering.As the story continues, it takes on a House That Jack Built feel as each animal rejects the blame and points their finger at the previous animal and therefore avoiding their own responsibility.Because of the mosquito's guilty conscious and continuing need to chatter, we now know, from a West African tale, why mosquitoes buzz in people's ears.

When Sir Geoffrey Blandon makes his intentions know that he would like the hand of Lady Rose Summer, her father wants to know if his intentions are honorable and hires the rather questionable Captain Harry Cathcare to do some intelligence work. Lady Rose, still young and impetuous, outs Blandon and is therefore called into question herself as not being ladylike and rather ruined for the season if not for all suitable suitors.Being banished from all proper soirees, Lady Rose finally accepts a weekend invitation to Lord Hedley's estate and what do you think happens - a woman is murdered, fingers are pointed, accusations are made and it's up to Rose, her newly fashioned and quite clever maid Daisy, Cathcare and his servant Becket to save the day. And don't forget Superintendent Kerridge of the Scotland Yard who just might have his eye on that unfeminine female.This was a fun romp of Edwardian scandal, intrigue and high society.Marion Chesney also writes the M. C. Beaton series Agatha Raisin and Hamish MacBeth

Why is it that a woman is expected to suspend reality and become completely brain dead to watch a romance movie? Maybe I just answered my own question when I added in the term romance movie.Linda Hamilton plays Julie a woman who has just realized that her husband is seeing a much younger woman. Now this is where the viewer is expected to become dumb. Julie lives in an upper income community and only accepts $25,000 as her half equity in the home and asks for no alimony. Moves into a questionable neighborhood, gets behind on her bills (where is the money). Gets mugged, goes to the hospital and has no medical insurance, loses her checkbook and credit cards, is evicted from her apartment for being one week late with the rent, bank takes an unprecedented amount of time in refunding the stolen funds. Sleeps in a car. Squats in an unoccupied open house. Orthopedic surgeon rides in and saves the day. The End.Really?Who believes this stuff and feels good after a movie like this? Now look around, whom do you know that has had their life fall out from underneath them and a knight rides in and saves the day?This is why I cannot watch movies like this. I guess I need a bit more reality and a lot less fluff to set the example that a woman can pick herself up by her proverbial bootstraps and make it on her own.

Charlotte La Rue likes her life the way it is, at fifty nine she is not yet ready to call it a day no matter what her son, a successful doctors, may think. She enjoys her quiet life, her steady clients and her talkative parakeet.Having opened up her maid service to support herself and her infant son after the death of her boyfriend in Vietnam, Charlotte has not looked back and wonder how life should have been, she is too busy looking forward and what she sees is pretty good. That is until Jackson Dubuisson, the husband of one of her regular clients, is found murdered and a couple of things that Charlotte has witnessed on her regular cleaning days just aren't adding up.It's hard to keep a professional distance when you see your clients as friends and your niece just happens to be one of the lead investigators, but Charlotte has seen a couple of things that just don't add up and being the helpful person that she is, she just had to lend her helping hand where she can. No matter how things turn out.Barbara Colley almost had me closing the book before I had gotten started. Early on there is a comment made about Charlotte's sons first wife that was a bit snide and over the top for a cozy. It came off to me as more of a personal attack to someone that the author knew in real life. Maybe I took it wrong, but it was like a "there I said it and now the whole world knows" kind of thing. It was very off putting and didn't need to be there.But I persevered and overall I'm glad I did, Colley introduced interesting characters that I'm sure will make future appearances and overall the writing and flow were steady, with the right amount of little red herrings sprinkled throughout the story to lead the reader down different paths in hopes that the who-done-it isn't found out too early.I'll definitely check out the second book in this series.

Such a disappointment. The first third of the book I spent counting how many times Ms Colley used the same word in a paragraph and spent little time following the very thin plotline. By the middle of the book, I mind blanked because I remember neither multiple word usage nor a plotline. By the end, whole paragraphs could have been removed and the overall storyline, what there was of it, could have held. As I said, the book was a letdown.Begrudging her upcoming sixtieth birthday, Charlotte LaRue, owner of Maid For A Day, grabs her cleaning supplies and heads out to her next major project, an older home in the Garden District of New Orleans that has been changed into individual apartments. When she hears the screams of one of her employees, she runs to aid only to discover a body in the closet dressed in boxers and a mardi gras mask.Not that that scene was strange enough, but under the mask was a man that was declared dead two years prior. How can that be? Charlotte's company rules of not messing in her client's business and her need to meddle conflict as she helps her niece, the police detective, and Louis her next-door neighbor solve this mystery.I recall the first book, Maid for Murder being much better so I am not sure what went wrong. The storyline was too slow and meandering with no real direction until the last 15 percent of the book where presto-chango, the murderer was discovered and they all lived happily ever after.I hope that the remaining books in this series are better, but I was so turned off by the book that I do not think I will be rushing to the next in the series.

I really enjoyed this very entertaining look at the wrangling of the British Parliament when supermarket manager Ros Pritchard is fed up with what is being offered to her in the way of representation and decided to run for Parliament herself. Getting the common people behind her, she wins a seat even though she knows nothing about politics.When in doubt, surround yourself with those who know what they are doing, unfortunately they all seem to have a skeleton in their closet. And soon so does Ros even though she has promised to be honest and forthcoming with the British citizens.Ros' unwavering honesty and innocence all comes to a boiling end when a secret is revealed and she must make a decision to be the Prime Minister with a secret or an honest above board wife and mother. She doesn't want to lie, but she doesn't want to make those that she loves suffer.From downed aircraft to car free save the environment days, there is never a dull moment in the life of Roz Pritchard. I highly recommend this series with its multiple storylines and a great cast of supporting characters.

First of all, just because you have seen the TV series doesn't mean that you can jump into the middle of the books and understand who Sookie is. Start at the beginning and your appreciation for Sookie will go a lot further.While Vampire Bill is off in Peru continuing his research, Sookie is reevaluation their relationship. That in itself creates a problem since Sookie has no limit to other men that are all so easily available to her.While driving home from a New Year's party at Merlott's, Sookie is distracted by a naked man running alongside the road, but unfortunately, this isn't just any man, this is Eric, the very delectable Sheriff of Area 5 who has not kept silent his attraction to Sookie. To compound this situation, Eric appears to be have a case of amnesia. He remembers nothing about who he is or for that matter, who Sookie is. Oh, dear, could this get any worse, well, apparently it can.Not only does Bon Temps have to deal with vampires, werewolves, and shape shifters, there is now a coven of very powerful witches that are attempting to take over Area 5.Well, you can't leave a naked man on the side of the road, so Sookie has decided to take Eric home to care for him. In so doing, she begins to see a very sensitive side to the very scary Eric, a side that Sookie finds quite irresistible.Charlaine Harris builds quite a strong story this time. With her usual humor and "where did that come from, but I love it" story writing, Sookie and Eric are enmeshed in one adventure after another that makes Sookie life with Bill seem rather normal. This is a great series, that blends just enough action and humor to keep the reader fully enthralled with Sookie

3rd and hopefully not final installment of Peggy Turner and Cobb's Landing. In this outing, Peggy the mayor of this small New England town, is forced by the irrepressible Max, to put aside her own Thanksgiving plans so Max can capitalize on an original Pilgrim Thanksgiving for the tourists. If this weren't enough, Peggy has to deal with the new obnoxious neighbor who is found dead on the village green, Stu's new fiance - which he is afraid to tell his own mother about and her growing love for Ian. I really enjoy this series of books and hope that Kate Borden hasn't stopped writing about the antics of this little town.

I really enjoy this series. Book one was good, but I think that this one, Death Without Company, was even better. The storyline and character development brought the characters into a realism that had you wondering if you really did know these people.Walt Longmire's decisions are never easy, but when Mari Borja is found dead at the same Assisted Living Facility as Lucian Connally, the retired sheriff of Absaroka County, Walt is throwing into the middle of a twisted story that has his scratching his head and wondering just who isn't tell the whole truth.Walt's department of misfits and new recruits has him questioning how the Crow, the Cheyenne, the Basques, millions of dollars in methane gas and an abusive drunk named Charlie Nurburn all come together and have their individual parts in the death of Mari. Add in his deputy Vic who is the most brazen character in this book, and Henry Standing Bear and his rather interesting use of non-politically correct English and you have both an excellent mystery and an entertaining insight into Durant, Wyoming.I space these books out in fear that I will run out of the adventures of Walt Longmire. Highly entertaining and definitely a book that you have to pay close attention to or you might just miss the little clues along the way.

I really wanted to like this series, since I enjoy the Allison Reynolds series so much, but that was not the case. Homicide Detective J.P. Beaumont of the Seattle Police Department comes across as too gruff and too much of the typical stereotype cop that you see every night on television.When a five year old child is found dead and the mother is caught up in a fundamentalist cult you know that there is not going to be a happy ending. Plus, a well seasoned cop suddenly falling for a stranger and unexplainably dreams of their life together just doesn't blend well for me. This story was just too choppy and all over the place.I am glad that I had found the Reynolds series first or I would have just totally given up on this author. Different strokes I guess, but I will not be finding myself looking for anymore J.P. Beaumont.

Visually, this is a very beautiful movie. The costumes and scenery are stunning, but I came away thinking that I was missing something. The overall plot is not very deep so I think that those who have read the book that this movie is based on - Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman might have an upper hand as to what was going on in the periphery.What the movie portrays is a beautiful woman (Kiera Knightly) trapped in a marriage to a man more interested in heirs then in his wife, so when the opportunity presents itself the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) moves his mistress it the home to taunt his wife with a woman who can have male heirs; and only to make matters more hurtful, the mistress in question was once the best friend of the Duchess herself.Not to be outdone, the Duchess takes on her own lover and publicly taunts her husband with a game of one-upsmanship. Unfortunately, in the 18th - century, this cannot end well for the woman and so with what was once a shining moment, she now finds herself begging for the morsels of her former life.I enjoyed the movie, I just wished that I had known more of the back story so I could appreciate the overall portrayal more and understood who all the side characters were.Princess Diana Spencer is a distant relative of Duchess Georgiana Spencer and after watching this movie you do wonder if History does repeat itself.

Though the reviews are quite mixed for this book, I actually enjoyed the book. It is rather refreshing when an author doesn't confuse his opinion with facts. Junger confesses that he himself doesn't know the truth and that the deeper he delves into the possibilities the more confused he became.Junger a resident of Belmont, Massachusetts relives his own family's brush with infamy when a man that once worked in their home could very well have been the Boston Strangler.As murders are taking place in the quiet suburb of Belmont the police are hard pressed for a suspect, that is until a black man is seen walking in the area of a recent murder. Roy Smith seems like the most likely candidate, he has a criminal record and was known to have worked in one of the victims homes. Easily convicted, the story seems to end there, that is until a man by the name of Albert DeSalvo enters the picture and the reader and author begin to question if the right man was convicted after all.

Kathy Reichs sure can write a descriptive scene, right down to the maggots on the body. Don't know if that would appeal to everyone, but it sure did draw a vivid picture.First of all, if you are looking for an identical match to the Bones TV show, well, this book isn't quite it. "Temperance Brennan of TV land" has more of a past then "book Brennan" and though they both share the same general education and experience, they are very different characters. Keeping that in mind, this book is still quite good as long and you remember to keep the two entities separate.Temperance, a forensic anthropologist, is call out to examine a mutilated and decomposing body in Quebec where she is on loan from her regular job in the states. After a thorough examination, she begins to see comparisons to previous cases, comparisons that she is having a hard time convincing others of. However, as more and more bodies turn up and more and more similarities present themselves, it is becoming harder and harder for the French bureaucrats to deny what Temperance is seeing. Add in information that Tempe's best friend has revealed and all hell breaks lose when the two explode into a terrifying finale with the final body count escalating.My only real concern with this book is the number of characters introduced. Which ones do I need to remember for the next book, who is recurring and who is just there for this one time event. I enjoyed this book and the series, I am sure, will settle down with each character having a more distinctive voice that will be easier for me, the reader, to keep straight.Ms Reich definitely draws you in quickly and hopefully the remaining books of this series will keep me just as enthralled.

When Sherry Moore was 5 years old she was found near death at the bottom of the stairs of a city hospital. She had no memory and no eye sight. As a young child, Sherry attends a funeral and while touching the deceased hand she "sees" what happened in their last 18 seconds of life. Their visions of life and their death.Kelly O'Shaughnessy new police lieutenant with seemingly unrelated abductions in Wildwood, New Jersey. That is they seem unrelated until she receives a phone call that starts to put some of the pieces together.Together with the help of Moore and her partner John Payne, crimes are solved that lead all parties concerned in directions that they could never see coming.A large cast of characters that seems to be disjointed all come together in a terrifying ending that has you rapidly turning pages until the dramatic conclusion that leaves you breathless and wanting more from an extraordinary author.If it's such a great book why only a 4? I was expecting it to be more about Moore's character. All characters are well drawn and each has their own storyline. Guess I just jumped to the wrong conclusion and got stuck there.

I know that there is a bit of controversy concerning the "good" that Debbie Rodriguez did in Kabul, but I really enjoyed this quick read book. Debbie is a young woman who is bored with her life and after two failed marriages decides that she would like to join up with an NGO (Non-Governmental Oraganization) and help people somewhere in the world. She is attached to a group of medical professionals sent to Afghanistan and not knowing how she could help - mentions by chance that she is a hair stylist. Little did she know that this profession had been banned by the Taliban and finding someone who could do hair was next to impossible in this country. Westerners, aid works and Afghani women swarmed to her. Knowing that there had to be more then just doing hair she approached US companies to see if they would support her desires to open a beauty school in Kabul to train the women there how to be successful beauticians so they could support themselves and their families without being hidden in the shadows like they had been for some many years. The women, their stories, their personal trials are just amazing and inspiring. Just to know that when presented with insurmountable odds, the human spirit can still beat those odds.

A corrupt small-town Florida police department arrests Rudy Kelly, a "slow" 19-year-old, for a murder he didn't commit, and, after an ineffectual public defender fumbles the case, Rudy receives a death sentence. Flashbacks to the 1960s New York childhoods of Mikey Kelly and Johnny Tobin. Ten years after Rudy's conviction, Tobin, now a hotshot Miami lawyer bored with his life, leaves his firm and finds a new direction after reading about Mikey's death and starts looking into his son Rudy's conviction. Written by an attorney that has been compared to Grisham. The story is kinda twisty, first time author and it seems like he just tried to put too much into it. Quite a roller coaster ride.

I started this out on audio, didn't much care for it, then switched to the book and enjoyed it much better.Lucie Montgomery returns home to Virginia after living for two years in France recovering from a bad car accident that has left her leg twisted and practically useless. But this doesn't get Lucie down; it's just one more thing to deal with. She is returning home because her father, the head of the family vineyard has died from an apparent hunting accident.Being away so long has left Lucie out of the loop and she returns to find that the vineyard, is crumbling under debt, her brother Eli is determined to sell off the whole shebang so he can build a new more fabulous home and her little sister Mia is now dating the guy that caused the accident that damaged Lucie's leg.Not that this isn't complicated already, but when Lucie's godfather is found murdered and the rest of the twisty plot of who done its and who will be murdered next, and who has a secret past and who will save the day. Not to mention a hidden necklace that belonged to Marie Antoinette and Lucie's mother's diaries. Yes, parts do get a little confusing with multiple plot lines and some apparent useless information, but hopefully the second in the series will straighten this out.

You can never go wrong with an Agatha Christie and with the little gray cells of Hercule Poirot the killer will be ensnared without the tiniest details missed.First penned as a stage production, Black Coffee has been rewritten by her grandson Michal Pritchard.Set in the early 1930's, Sir Claud Amory, an atomic scientist, has invited Poirot to his estate to personally transport a formula back to London. Sir Claud realizes that the formula is missing and offers his family and guests one minute in total darkness to return the formula with no questions asked. Well, one minute is all it takes to murder Sir Claud. Upon his arrival, Hercule Poirot is enlisted into finding both the formula and the killer.Of course Agatha gives us a whole room full of likely suspects, each with their own secrets and story, but with Captain Hastings at his side, Poirot makes quick work of this very captivating who-done-it.

Kate Doyle, newbie Colorado realtor, knew that her job could be complicated, but when dealing with the sale of her friends' home, little did she know that it could be deadly. When Kate arrives at Mark's home for him to sign the sales papers she find him in the elegantly appointed library with a letter opener sticking out of his neck. Usually, this would be an open and shut case, the spouse is always the first suspect, but with Mark's philandering ways, the suspect list grows exponentially. So of course, Kate has to snoop and solve the case to free her friend of suspicion.Maggie Sefton is known for her Knitting Series and I believe that this book is the first in a new series. Interesting start with what could be a good continuation of characters. Can't wait to see what develops between Kate and the home inspector / gun expert Chekov.

I can not get enough of this series. I adore the characters, I adore the settings and I adore the fallibility and the deep caring that binds Lori Shepherd to her friends and family.Lori's rather calm life is suddenly turned upside down when death threats hit home and her and the lives of her twin 5 year old sons are threatened. Bill calls in a trusted family friend, Sir Percy Pelham and his gigantic helicopter to whiz them away while Bill stays home going through old files to see who is holding a grudge.But life can't be that simple for Lori, after arriving at Percy's castle on an island off of Scotland, she begins to notice things that just do not make sense. Like why do simple sheep ranchers need satellite dishes and gourmet food in the market? What are these villagers up to and can Lori figure it out, before jumping to too many conclusions, before the true danger arrives.Peter a character from previous books makes reappearance and it's nice to see what he has been up to. I highly recommend this series - it's a great breakaway from the heavier stuff in our TBR's.
