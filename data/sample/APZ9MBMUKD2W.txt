This is a good effort but the Author's Book about the US Army during WWII (Theres a War to be Won) is a much better book. If you want something better, go get the Ballantine Books on the B-29,the Mosquito or Zero if you can find them.

John Romer does a good solid job in this one of his earliest films. The only real compliant I have is that it is way too short. It is a very meaty subject (The New Testament and its early history) that could of easily have been explored further. That and the photography was not up to his usual standards.Hopefully he will come back to this subject soon and in DVD format! I can recommend highly his other films, "The 7 Wonders of the World" and "Byzantium".

It is a real shame that illness has struck down Michael Fox. I only hope that things will change for the better for him. Anyway, While I liked his Back to the Future Series. Doc Hollywood is far and beyond the better film. What with a stronger plot, sharper writing, a charming and talented cast is it no wonder that I feel that this film will stand the test of time? So if you want to spend some time and walk away with a good feeling in your heart then give this film a shot.

Everytime I see this film, I get so glad that I dropped out of Law School. Kingfield is alive, well and lurking out there. If you are thinking about going to Law School, see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs. The "Little Questions that tumble in your brain are really there. The Stress over grades is real, the classmates who crash & burn are real. I can not recommend this film too highly to potential 1Ls.

I read this book along time ago and still remember Sam Elliot doing a fine job in the made for TV Movie.(I hope that they bring it out soon in DVD) This novel captures the inner conflict that all leaders face of mission versus troop. (Taking care of yourself & your career versus getting the job done. Hopefully the little voice in you will make sure that you put career way behind the troops & doing the right thing)Even though the book is now 30+ years old it still has a lot to offer to those willing to listen & learn.

Most Teaching movies I avoid like the plague. The formula is way too predictable and insulting to me. This film on the other hand is not one of those.It is well written and has a very strong cast of actors that show the career of a British school teacher at one the elite "Public" read private and very expensive schools for the Upper Class/Establishment of England.I also like how the female actresses are allowed to be real persons not just part of the props. That and the idea of how a shell shocked soldier of WWI is allowed to gradually grow into becoming a first rate teacher. Altogether a strong and very up lifting film to behold!

This a very enjoyable film as long as you don't think too hard about it. It is your classic 70's campy feeling film about a couple of Brigands. (Its okay to take off and go on a crime spree because of the Great Depression and those nasty banks)But if you stop and think about it, the trail of destruction and death they left behind them, you sober up real fast. That is why I always like the ending with the ambush of these two. Frankly they deserved it in real life. Altogther a great cast and a great movie.

Then heres is a great place to start off from. The Authors cast of Characters from Attilla, The various Popes, Henry VIII, Luther, Magellion et al is well chosen and covered. Like the fact the so called two pillars of the Protestant Reformation Henry VIII and Luthor really hated each other with a passion. A real good to go!

I guess that I am one of those who fall into the camp of Citizen Kane was a great movie but its not the be all and end all movie of film history. Considering the time and technology available Orson Welles did a brillant job on William R. Hearst.I shall also acknowledge that it took a lot of guts on the part of all hands involved to go up against the old boy. But they did and made a great film.But I still find it a dated film that covers a period of history that really does not move me like the American Civil War did or some other periods of our nations history. Altogether I rather watch "Casablanca","The Day the Universe Changed" or Ken Burns "The Civil War".

One gets the feeling that in a way this was the way it really was back then for the Bad Guys. It's 1913 and the West is changing and changing fast. A group of really hard, bad men are trying to make one last score in South Texas. It fails miserably and they head for Mexico. What follows is a great story about loyality, male bonding,honor amoung thieves and how eventually justice is served for all concerned. The ending has reached now mythical status in film history. A very tough, gritty movie with some great actors, directing, writing, photography that has stood the test of time.

I just finished reading this fact fill and well written book about the fall of Constantiniople to the Ottomans. I thought the Author has done a right proper job telling us about one of the turning points of History. When the Armies of Islam had reached the height of their power as a convential military power. This siege was to prove the last time that they could completely defeat an entrenched & determined European power. Soon after they would be stopped cold at the Gates of Vienna and at Malta.I also thought that the Author did a very good job describing the various facts and Characters of this battle. Especially those of the Sultan and his great drive to reduce the last bastion of the Roman Empire. (He was also one hard character that I would not want to met in a dark alley unless I was heavily armed and not alone!) Altogether I just wish I had this book with me when I was at Istanbul last.

This a really good film that shows the raising and training of a typical British Infantry unit during WWII. While it is a propaganda film it is not overwhelming either.I think that it shows how one must go about creating a viable fighting unit from a liberal democratic society w/o creating a Sparta instead of saving Athens. Considering the time and place it is a 1st rate film for its time.

The man deserved to be locked up and have the key melted down.A typical 1960's feel sorry for the criminal film. You never hear about the people and their families who were hurt by this evil man. He was tried and convicted for a reason, even this film can't make the case that he got a raw deal. Considering the time and place. The prison system and Warden were very decent to him.Anywhere else and he would of had a necktie party within the year of his killing his victim.

Today no one thinks that they could fly a jet or command a ship. But everyone thinks that they could command troops in the field. This book shows its not as easy as it looks. You don't line your tracks and grunts up in a line & go get them. This small, slim book is a great primer for the people who are going into the Mechinized Infantry or if you are going into the NTC for fun in the Sun.Altogether this is a great companion for the "Defense of Duffers Drift" and should be read and shared by the rough ,tough soldiery of the Green Machine.

The "China" Marines who had been stationed over in the Middle Kingdom from the Boxer Rebellion to the start of the Second World War to protect our commerical interests and citizenry over there. It also gives the feeling & process about how a peacetime unit has to quickly convert to a war time mentality in order to survive & get the mission done.

Angus McBride is one of the best Military Illustrators on the scene. His work is always interesting , realistic , convincing &amp; coupled with a very sly sense of humor. If your forte is Military History and want an idea of what a warrior looks like from the past. You could do a whole lot worse than this series. (I myself own over 300 of them and use them a lot in my classroom) The only down side of this series is that the written part is usally not up to the caliber of the illustrations.

I especially liked it when they show the yellow legs walking their mounts while out in patrol. It also shows the loneiness of command and how hard it is to walk away from it. Altogether a grand movie, with some great acting, writing, scene location. I say Garry Owen and Good to Go!That and I hope you all make it to Fiddler Green.

If one is seeking for an excellent overview of an overlooked part of European History, then you have lucked out. For some reason the West has decided to ignore the Bulwark of Constantinople that protected the West from the forces of the East for over a 1000 years. Maybe because they stabbed the Greeks in the back in 1204. Anyway, Mr. Romer as usual did a wonderful job setting out the history of a great people. I can safely say that its a great film to behold.

I just wish my University days had been as much fun. But some of the Houses were trying very hard to keep up the tradition.So if you want a blast to the past to recapture the magic moments of some great actors and actresses then this is one of them. John where ever you are now, Thanks for the laughs!

A cute film but most cathouses are tough, hard, places full of strange, desperate & scary people. This film alludes to some of the problems of running a whore house but because of social restraints could not be addressed. I feel that prostitution ( a necessary evil but still an evil) should not be glamourized & the same goes for some other films that come to mind that try to do it.

When I was in the Army, I was told to see this tape asap. It was good advice in that it tells one how to hold a piece of ground under very difficult terms. Its the closest one can get to understand how men can be made to fight and fight well under some really great leadership. The Widows Army was very lucky to have such men. It is a testimony to their training and leadership that such green troops performed so well. The Zulus are also shown in this movie as very worthy foes as they should be. (Cold Steel against Rifles!! That takes balls made of brass.)A timeless story that is well worth the time and money. As a sidebar this should be complimented with the Book "The Defense of Duffer's Drift" if you can find it.

Mr. Atkinson has written a really good book on the birth of the American Army as a potent fighting force in the ETO. It is also a good introduction to the Byzantine world of the Mediterrain politics. If you are interested in this period of history you could do a whole lot worse by passing this up this tome.

This is one of the 1st great war movies that I had seen when I was a youngster. G.C. Scott was just wonderful as "Him".While it was not a perfect flick (Patton had a much higher voice, Bradley was not so a great General, wrong tanks)The overall theme and spirit captures one of our greatest Generals.I still feel sorry for the poor Italians and Germans who went up against this man. They never had a chance!! I just hope that Valhalla is big enough for such a man.

The scale and expense of this film is just mind boggling! That and I think Rex Harrison really got into the spirit of what Julius Caesar must of been like. It is also obvious that the fire between Mr. Burton and Ms Taylor was real.

The premise of a doomed lovers that are close but far away, an evil Bishop, a some what honorable thief, a crazed with guilt monk and the story comes alive before your eyes. Couple this with some excellent special effects, photography, realistic fight scenes, strong cast, great locations and the viewer can't lose. A wonderful movie!

Paul Scofield was just a grand Sir (Saint) Thomas More in this movie. The other players were also of extremely high quality. (Hint- If You like "Rumpole of the Bailey" or "Jaws" you might see some familiar faces)The only problem I have with this film was that More was not that nice in real life. One does not advance under the Tudors especially under Henry VIII by being a really nice guy. (More had several people put to death because of their Protestant beliefs.)That and I thought him a fool to risk & lose it all for a really silly principal. It would of been one thing to have been required to renounce his Catholic beliefs but this was never asked of him.Instead he ruined his family and friends. This is just another example of some really crazy thinking and denial of what is going on. (The Reformation and a huge real estate transfer that welded the Gentry & Nobility loyality to the Crown)Henry rightfully saw this behavior as an attack on his policies and so had no choice on the matter.It was either him or his ex chancellor had to go. The idea of the loyal opposition having not been born yet. But enough said, its a great movie!

Was that of Mr. Heston and to Mr. Harrison battling each other over the project.

Many have tried but none has come as close to getting it right on this Renaissance Man.(Who else can say they have been POTUS, holder of the MOH and The Nobel Peace Prize?) The writing is almost Homeric and loaded with fascinating tidbits from the life of this Great Man. What the Author wrote about TR's daughter Alice alone is worth buying it. But I don't want to give it away !

A film that shows both sides of the conflict and does not glorify what is in fact a battle of wits with your personal life falling apart at the same time. This Film just shows what happens when you get a great story and let it ride. Couple it with an outstanding cast, great photography, direction, scene location and a just wonderful music backup & it can't help but kick butt. A job well done to all hands!

Altogether a good hard & honest look at some really remarkable Americans that makes a compelling story.(The Class of 1966 suffered one of the highest casuality rates in the Academies war record)

A ruthless, cunning enemy doing its best to put it out of the fight. The British loyally doing their best to supply the heroic Maltese with huge losses of men and ships in the process. (We even helped out with the loan of the Aircraft Carrier Wasp to deliver some much needed replacement Spitfires.)A good love story and some really strong actors who seem to be at their best. That and for the time some very good special effects with a ending you don't expect.Altogether a tape that is well worth the coin. I just hope that the DVD comes out soon!

It shows one of the most horrific fights of the war the most aptly named "Hamburger Hill".

A great film that shows the world one of the real odd birds that the British Military puts out every once in a while. Men like Gordan, Wingate & Clive who you don't really know where to place them. But none the less they are very valuable men to have around in a tight place. This film takes the story of Lawrence as he goes from a raw junior Officer to Desert Legend. While it could of been very easy to make it one of those Ripping Good storys about one of the lads winning the war by themself in Arabia. The story resists this impluse and so makes itself a legend in itself. I can not praise this film too highly!

If you just think that the charge of the light brigade was the whole fight in the Crimean War, then take some time and check this book out. This war was the start of the birth of the Modern British Army. Yes, that war was so bloody awful that it caused the start of the reform of one of the most conservative institutions in history. Picture the the US Army of WWII fighting in Iraq today with the same equipment,systems and you start to get the idea. As an added bonus the Uniform Illustrations are great.

Being from an "Army" family & an ex-soldier, I can understand what these people went thru and the whole story rang true for me.To become a good Marine or Soldier by it very nature requires that the recruit be subjected to various high pressures both mental & physical.That and be exposed to different and very high moral,ethical standards during his intial training.This is why Boot or Basic training requires that the Rookie be degraded, highly stressed, have ground off the rough spots then formed, conditioned and then polished to a high degree. Otherwise we are doing a real disservice both to the young snuffie and threaten the national security of the nation at the same time. As witnessed by the poor performance of the Army in the 1st months of the Korean war. when Garrison troops were sent into battle not properly trained or motivated.The average person if you went up to them and say "Go kill that person over there with your trench knife" would look at you like you are from another world and rightly so! The properly trained and led soldier on the other hand would go and do it w/o a second thought. Most folks either don't know this or refuses to acknowledge this dirty little fact. this is also another reason why the Warrior has a real attitude toward the society that he guards. Because he knows that deep down his basic job is to stop bullets from hitting the ungrateful citizenry.That is also why the Military places such a high emphasis on ethics especially on those in a leadership position. I am just so glad that the Corp was gutsy enough to allow the author into Parris Island. I think that the author has done a great job in telling this most important story about the Rough, hard men who are willing to do the hard & nasty. So that we can sleep safely in our beds. God bless them,one and all !

They were extremely tough, hardy, could make do with next to nothing, utterly cold ruthless killers who with some outstanding leadership almost took over the Old World. Great Text is provided that disproves by some good scholarship the old myths i.e. Huge Numbers were the only reason why they won etc. Couple with some great pictures that make this a good value for those interested in this period of history.

If you like the Eastern Roman Empire and would like to read some good make believe stories about it. Then get introduced to Basil and his adventures in this slim little book. It seems to me that the Author has a great love and grasp of the ins and outs of that old and somewhat ignored Empire. I also feel that this is when the Author has really hit his stride and it shows in this labor of love.

The Man knew more about Soldiers and soldiering than most Generals today. His line "here lies a fool who tried to hustle the East" has more wisdom in those few lines than most books.If you want a realistic look at how life is as opposed to the way you want it to be, do a Recon on the Old Boy.

I had frist read the Authors novels about that cad Flashman & was immediately hooked on his great writing skills and historical research. (I just wish that I could write 1/10 as well as he.)Then I have discovered this gem of a book about his time in the 14th Army fighting the Japanese in Burma during War Two as a young enlisted man. It is just marvelous in that it gives one the feeling of the grit, heat, dirt and loss of war without drowning one in self pity while being in the Border Regiment.This book is one of the best war story of a British Tommy that I have ever read. The book is well worth the time and coin!

GMF has outdone himself with this book about his part in the Horrific war in Burma during War II. He tells of his time as a junior enlist then junior NCO with the Border Regiment. He spins his tale extremely well about the story of the last great War fought by the Old Anglo-Indian Army of the Raj. So if you want to get a feel for a bygone Army, its various & exotic troops, weapons and some great characters like the Iron Duke and the Impressive FM Slim then this is the place for you.

As someone who lives in LA, it was a flash to the past with this film. I can not recommend this film too much! Some films just seem to have the magic touch, where everything seems to push it toward excellence. The writing , photography, location selection, musical score, direction, the selection of the cast,the actors dedication in this film are top drawer. This film just shows what Hollywood could do but usually does'nt.This film I believe will stand the test of time as one of the great classics of film.

The 1st Regiment of Foot Guards is always an interesting subject for me. Most folks think that all they are is toy soldiers that parade outside Buck House.With their officers being rich poofs from Eton awaiting their inhertiage and place in the House of Lords. Or theother picture being mindless machines being terrorized by fanatical NCO's of Monty Python fame. There is a lot more to them then that. They are real professional soldiers that have taken part in some of the Monarchs toughest fights. Theirs really is the story of the British Army and a rich and varied history it is. Couple with Messr. McBrides illustrations its well worth buying to add to a military collection.

This film based upon the Play is just wonderful and from what I have seen is a very accurate about the Henry II and his extremely troublesome family.It has so many great lines and complex characters that it just overwhelms ones senses.("I could of conquered all of Europe But I had Women in my Life!" or "Anything can happen if dead carpenters can rise from the Dead")I have seen this film several times now and maybe I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But I always find something new and wonderful in this film. I can not recommend this film high enough to those who like the Middle Ages and the Father of the English Common Law! Mr. O'toole and Ms. Hepburn were never better than here. Even if they did not look like the originals.(Henry was Fatter and Eleanor was was not so skinny either.)

This is one of the best books that I have read about the US Navy's biggest fight so far and the reason why the Pacific even today is an American Lake. This Book has everything that a naval history bluff could ask for.What with a desperate enemy on the ropes. Who hopes to hold on to their ill gotten Empire against some very unfriendly Americans led by the Navy's version of Patton - Admiral William "Bull" Halsey.What follows is one glorious fight what with some very effective Submarine attacks, the Last Battleship Fight where the enemy gets their T crossed, the Destruction/ Sacrifice of the Japanese Aircraft Carriers, the Japanese Battle Line going against Jeep carriers & the Bulls Run. It's one hell of a story and its told very well indeed!

The problem being that when I was in the Green machine. I had met quite a few Non Comissioned Officers & Commisioned who had been in the War. All of them were some real hard nose types whose motto was "Not on my shift or in My Army!".They almost to a man said while they had heard of such things happening, they never saw it themselves. (And yes quite a few of them had the scars to prove they had been there.)Now I am sure that this kind of stuff went on in the rear with the gear. But out there in the grass, I find a lot of this hard to buy. You depend way too much on each other out there just to survive.That and no unit could have that many problems with the people in it and survive any amount of time what so ever out in the field, Let alone combat.Also where were the Officers and the Senior NCO's? Even if the Company had one good leader, they would not of allowed such a state of affairs to happen.(Contary to popular belief even then the Army had some really great Leaders that Walked the Walk & Talked the Talk) But then what do I know?

Mr. Gibson is to be congratuated on bring back the tradition of the grand sweeping epic movies. I don't think that "Longshanks" (Edward I, who was that tough in real life) would of liked it but who says life is fair? That and Robert the Bruce was a much tougher customer than shown here. But it is a great movie especially with the Battle scenes except for this question. Where was the Bridge at Stirling?

Mr. Foote has done one of the best outlines of the American Civil War period. If one wants to read a book that is just chocked full of interesting incidents and characters. Then one needs go no further then these 3 massive tomes. Just don't be put off by their massive size, it is well worth the time.While Bruce Catton is a good rivial, he is a Yankee. Mr. Foote is a true son of the South and so you get a much needed Southern View point that is missing in most of the current popular books on this turning point of our nations history.

The only reasons as to why I read this book was because of Mr. Turtledoves reputation as writer of fine literature. That and my love of the history of the Easter Roman Empire. Both reason's were amply rewarded by this book.It just re enforces my gratitude to live in 21st Century America and not then &amp; there. That and to Thank God for our Founding Fathers for having established the Republic.In that Justinian was a very evil &amp; self centered man who lived in a very hard time &amp; place. Altogether He was an adventurer of the worst kind who left a wake of death destruction where ever he went.

This is one of Mr. Romers better efforts both as a book and as a video. He takes you places where most folks will never be able to go to. He then takes what you think is nothing and shows you how it is really connected physically to the Hellenistic Era. He has opened my eyes to an era that I had not really thought important but I now see the errors of my ways. His choices of music, locations and his train of thought used in the film are outstanding. I just hope that it comes out in DVD soon. All together a mighty effort that pays off handsomely, Mega Kudos to all hands involved!

GW is a very hard man for Americans to warm up to the. The Man is like another Virginian that comes to mind, Robert E. Lee. Both seem to be Marble Men (Not of real flesh & blood). All I can say is Thank God we have men like them when we needed them.Mr Daniels does his best to create the persona of out Founding Father and I feel that he comes pretty close to the mark.This films captures what I feel is the key moment of Washington's life as a General. In a bold and courageous move he won a good solid victory that helped keep the cause alive. No one else could of done it. I also feel that it showed accurately for a movie at least what ot must of been like to have been there.The uniforms seemed correct as was the weopons and tactics.All around a good addition to ones collection.

Sorry but I was very disappointed in this film! The Story of Alexander is a great one and a good moral lesson to boot. The man went out and basically took over a huge chunk of the known old world. He was one hell of a soldier and General. But He also wound up as a monster and a tryant who had lost his soul in the loneliness and madness of being an absolute monarch. Who was probadly was poisoned by his nobles in Bagdad as they were terrified of him.Also his conquest helped fianance the Hellenistic Age which established Greek Culture as one of the Pillars of Western Civilisation. That would of been nice to mention in the film. Or the establishment of that lovely city in Egypt with the nice library.But instead we get this dogs breakfast with some very good special effects. That basically said that he was Gay and incidentally kicked The Persian Empires butt. I have no problem with the established historical fact that he was either gay or bisexual or whatever. But there is a whole lot more to the story than just this.Like why did he do this all this fighting? (Avenge the Persian Invasion of Greece a century before) Why did they drink like fish back then? (All soldiers drink to a greater or lessor degree)Why did Alexander kill his oldest ,best General and his family? (Because of raging insecurity after his pages tried to kill him) Why did the Army refuse to go into India? (It would of been nice to have one of the enlisted tell us why. Like "I wanna go home & I want to spend my loot!")Hopefully some one some day will do this story justice but I guess its not today!(Hint go see Michael Woods In the Footsteps of Al the Great)

Puller was one of the real old time Warriors that Robert E.Lee or Stonewall Jackson would of known and welcomed to their outfits. Its a pity that he is not so well known outside of the Soldiers world.This book frankly was a real surprise to me as I did not expect such a well researched and balanced book by a "Brother" Marine Officer. But if one wants to get past all the nonsense put out and find instead the real Man, then go no further. The other book "Marine!" is a lot more fun to read, but if you want the cold hard facts of a really great warrior go here instead.Altogether another example of the right man at the right place at the right time.

What with going from the rock bottom of poverty to commander of the entire Yankee Army then the House House to poverty again. Who never the less maintains his dignity and sense of honor thru out. Then follows up with heroically battling cancer to finish his memoirs to provide for his family. In this 1st book Mr. Catton who writes so well covers Grants rise to the top. Or as he said a major cog just dropped into the machine that would destroy the Confederacy. If you like to read some well chosen words on the War between the States, then get this series of books.

My Uncle Max gave a copy of this book back in Xmas 69. Everytime I have read this book I learn something new about shooting from one of the real gun experts. Col. Townsend was the real thing in a world of wanna be's and "There I then made the shot of a life time. When I shot a 100 ton elephant with a BB gun at a 100 yards."The Good Col. was one of the old Blue Bloods who decided to follow a different drum. So he ran off and joined the Army for the Spanish War of 98. This in turn led to a grand life in the great out doors and a Colonels Eagle.The information that he has imparted to me has held true for the past 30 odd years. I can only recommend it highly to those who love good rifles and good stories.Especially if one loves the classic 1903 Springfield in its various forms.

What a show! A Boomtown that arises out of nothing, where there is no law. Where nothing is as it seems. A host of characters that defy generalizations i.e. An English Crime Lord who is just fascinating because of his complexity. A Sheriff that seems to to a stand up guy but has a weakness for the rich widow. A Hooker with a sense of right & wrong. The list just goes on & on. So why is it I get the feeling that John Wayne would not of lasted very long here? I just hope the next session maintains the standard next year.

Boy graduates from College, then has a torrid, sordid affair with his Dad's best Friend/Business Partner's Wife.He then goes thru a phase of alienation with his parents. Then he breaks off the affair with Ms. Robinson in order to stop the marriage of her daughter. So that he can run off with her. There by by ruining Dad's business and a marriage.But on the plus side it has a great musical score. It sounds a lot like something out of Larry Springer to me. But then I could be wrong!

There was No British Army in the 19th Century! There was however a great collection of some real fighting Regiments that went out and made a huge portion of the world part of the largest Empire the world has seen so far. It was not until Cardwell & Wolesey that the British started to assemble an Army that could hold off the Germans at Mons in August 1914. If your interest is that you want to know a lot about the Tommy Atkins & his Officers. That and of the various ways & units he lived in and fought with then go no further. Its a fine story and worth the time.

I think that the illustrations were 1st rate. As I was in the Army during the "Army Of Excellence", I thought Mr. Rottman had a couple of good points. But I also think that some of the problems faced by the Officers Corp should of been addressed like the zero defect mentality and the fear of making a mistake by Junior Officers. Also the up and out program that has a very bad effect on the ethical standards of Army Leadership which fosters way too much careerism in my humble ex enlisted man opinion.

Imagine a bright honorable man & inflict some distasteful handicaps upon him. Then set him into a snakepit of a family that can & will kill anyone that is in the way. Then sit back and watch some great entertainment. Because this is the premise of this great production by the Brits. The twists and turns of this story are just unbelieveable and the scary part is that its mostly true.So if you want to see a great play with some great acting and writing about the Early Roman Empire. Then Robert Graves work is the place to go.

This book is a good introduction to some of Britains old County Regiments which formed the backbone of the Infantry branch of the British Army. While it can be confusing to the reader with the various disbandments, the Cardwell reforms of the 1880's and the amalagmations of the various old regiments in the recent past. In the limited space provided, the author has given it the old college try. The really bright spot is the illustrations by Mr. Roffe.

Col. Thomason was a member of the Marine Brigade that fought in the War to end all wars(WWI to us now). He like a lot of other soldiers wrote to suppliment his meagre pay (F.M. Slim did it also under an alias)The good news being that he could really write and write very well about the Corp that he loved so well. So if you want to read about the "curiously to type" individuals that made up the Old Corp, then go no further.

A court martial film based during the Boer War with Austrialian Officers being charged with War Crimes. Does'nt sound too good huh? Well it fooled me! I was touched and moved by this film. The British Army justice system and Lord Kitchener don't come out looking so good. Now I understand why the "Pommys" are not trusted down under. Great acting and direction, all hands should be commended for this film!

If you want to get a hint of why Islam is not happy with the Western Christain World.Then this is a good place to start. While it is very PC it is balanced by some good old fashion British humor. ("No more Mr. Nice Guy!") Also it presents some interesting theories and ideas. For example the role of the new and aggressive Papalacy, the Eastern Roman Empire and its call for troops from the "Franks". What the Emperor got instead was a huge Barbarian Horde descending on his Empire. I almost feel sorry for the Moslems when Raymond & friends was unleased upon them. Altogether this is another classic British History movie and well worth the money

The telling of the Last Stand of the Spartans at Thermopylae in a well written novel. The story put forth is well organized and written about some really great troops who helped stop the Persian long enough for the rest of the Greeks to rally and defeat the on coming threat to Western Civilisation.

RSM Chappell has done an excellent job on one of the British Armys less know but none the less very vital unit. The Redcaps as the Military Police are known over there are the Police Department of the Army.Theirs is a very tough, dirty & demanding job that is not done properly can blow up in your face as history has been shown in Iraq. It was also an eye opener to me in that he does not gloss over some of the problems the Brits faced with some of their more rowdy rascals. Especially after WWII when the Army it seems had more than their fair share of discipline problems with their National Servicemen.Also this Book is the exception that proves the general rule about the Osprey Series. I.E. you either have excellent illustrations or a well written text, very seldom do you have both. Fortunetley, Mr. Chappell has the skill & experience to do an outstanding job in both areas. His illustrations show a keen use of color, realism and a wealth of experience to back it up.It is also very clear that he has a lot of love and respect for good soldiers. If I see either his name or Mr. McBride no matter the subject, I need to buy the book as I know that I am in for a treat.

While the Title is a bit of a misnomer(Julius Caesar would of eaten HST for Breakfast and not broken into a sweat) I also will grant he was one of those men who could drive any one to drink or chewing the carpet.(Ike said that he learned the art of acting as Mac's aide during inter war P.I. garrison duty) None the less MacArthur was one of those Generals who got the job done and keep the casualities down while doing it. Manchester has done a great job on a very complex & very controversal subject with his usual great flair.

There are a lot of lessons to be learned here that could apply to what is going on right now.

This is one of the frist primers for Junior Officers and NCO's on how to hold onto a piece of property. The format of this tome is just brillant. The gist of the story being of a young British Lt.going to sleep and dreams of being ordered to hold a river crossing during the Boer War. After losing several times to the crafty Boers, the Lt. taking heed of lessons learned, finally gets his act together and defeats the Boers.The lessons are timeless and relevant for todays Warriors. It is a book that is well worth the time and effort if one is going in harm's way.

When one thinks of the Naval War with Hitler its the U Boats that usually came to mind. Which is a pity as the German navy was more than just the Submarine campaign. What with the pursuit of the Bismarck, the commerce raiders and the immobilisation of a big portion of the Royal Navy and the USN by their sheer presence of the much smaller German Surface fleet. Its a good sea story that worth reading about.

Col. Weeks has done an excellent job considering the constraits of the Ballantine Series. Looking over the vast scale of the Subject, it is very well organized, informative and well illustrated book. The Author also tells of the overall thought and priorites of small arms developement during the great unpleasantries.When the war started off almost everyone started with basically WWI Rifles with the notable exceptions of the US Army's excellent M1 Garand. I.E. very well built almost hand made rifles that had probadly had seen service in WWI. But with the ever growing demand by the troops for things that go bang. The Warring nations Ordnance departments had to start cutting corners. What with the use of sheet metal, plastic and increasing tolerances. This coupled with an ever growing demand for more and more personal fire power led to a new family of weapons. Like the Sten Gun, Grease Gun, the Schmeiser and the German Assault Rifle. So if you love guns and their history this is a must have book.

It always amazes me how few Americans know about this great man.I first heard of him while in the Army and how he made the changeover of Army from a sleepy institution and made it into one of the finest fighting forces that they world has ever seen. Then how he unleashed it upon one of the greatest threats that Western Civilisation has seen since Atilla the Hun. He then followed it up as the father of the Marshall Plan which saved western Europe from a new Dark Age and the enslavement of the Soviet Empire. All the while establishing a record of honor, honesty and integrity that is just unbelieveable. All I can say is here was a Man!

I really think that this film is some good propaganda for the Isreali's especially when they really needed to shore up their over seas supporters. The only real problems that I have with it is the idea that an American Officer was needed to get things squared away. (I sure that the Isreali Officers Corp would find this offensive to them.) That and the Arab enemy is showned to be some type of sub human that is the way of the righteous Israli Manifest Destiny. But is none the less a good war story but its not the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

I thought that this film was just glorious! While it starts out very slow and tedious it more than makes up for it by the last 2/3.The casting was very good as Busey played a very good Gen. Wheeler (although "Fighting Joe" was a much smaller man in size)Sam Elliot was a perfect match for Bucky O'Neil. That and Tom Beringer made a very fitting performance of Theodore Roosevelt.(Who has been called a steamroller in trousers, what a stud of a President was he! We sure could use him today!!)By the by TR was awarded a Medal of Honor for his service at San Juan Hill. It was just 82 years late, but thats the Army for you.The uniforms and weapons were very accurate to my eye as was the use of terrain.All in all I just hope that this film comes out in DVD soon! Well done to all hands involved!

I have found this book to become a permanent part of my humble library. If one was to have only one book about the British Empire, one could do a whole lot worse than this little tome.It is not for the faint hearted PC historian but a real nuts ands bolts book about the Men who went out with amazingly small but highly effective Armies and made a huge chunk of the map pink. (For those not in the Know, the Old Empire was always coloured Pink on the maps) I can only hope that our Army would do so well in Iraq. I can recommended it most highly as it is with Mr. Farwell's other books

This book is amoung the 1st to take a more realistic look at the raising and history of one of Britains most misunderstood outfits.

A good solid book that covers one of the more controversial campaigns of WWII. It covers the period when the US Army hit its stride and became one of the finest fighting Armies in history. That and when its Officers Corp brought forth such leaders like Patton, Truscott and Ridgeway who would write some great pages in the history of our wars.It is also a great German Victory when w/o air cover and little or no support from the Italians. Did the German Army conduct a fighting retreat from the island to the mainland of Italy.Hence the controversy.

This book tells the story of a lowly Army (Private) Rifleman, who by no fault of his own is left on his own. So instead of curling up and giving up, he elects to go bravely forth and creates a nightmare for the French. (Anyone who gives the French a hard time can't be all bad in my book!)A 1st rate book for those who want to do the right thing in life !

If you want to see some great disinformation, then get this film. It is so far removed from reality that it is almost brillant. Wilson was easily not one of our better Presidents.In that He was the one who introduced segregation into the Federal Government. He turned over the US Enonomy over to the Bankers with the Federal Reserve. He invaded Mexico because he did not like personally the new President of Mexico. He also invaded Haiti to protect the United Fruit Company. Then he had the gall to run as the Man who kept us out of the War.Having then won the election of 1916, after having lost control of his foreign policy to the Germans declared war on the Germans.(He also pointly did not visit the AEF when he went to France)He then capped his career by losing the hard won peace. Of course he blames the Senate by its refusal to join the League of Nations. (Never mind the fact the Senate had some reasonable doubts about the League and Wilson refused to listen to the Senate or make any kind of deal making offers/concessions) So making Hitler an almost forgone conclusion. Otherwise he was a great President.

Mr, Fraser has written a really good book, which makes a lot sense and was fun to read. One gets tired of hearing from the P.C. and the "Caring Brigade", so when I started reading this text it really was a joy to these tired old eyes.Not that I don't agree with everything with the Author. For example his oppostion to the 4th Afghan War. But Mr. Fraser has earned his right to opposed that war. (Anyone who fought under Slim in Burma has my respect) He also put forth ones of the best arguements against the EU that I have ever read.I also liked reading about Mr. Fraser's movie career especially about the Musketeers series in this tome. All in all it's one of his better books that I have read of his since "Flashman in the Great Game. I am really looking forward to "Flashman on the March" and just hope that he will get Flashy's involvement in the American Civil war edited soon!

If you really want to get an idea of the size of Alexander the Great, then go watch this film. Mr.Woods gives a 1st rate job of tracing the steps of Alexanders thru the Middle and Far East. He also takes great care to give a good hard, honest and balanced look at the man warts and all. In my humble opinion, the phrase what "profits a man who inherits the whole earth but loses his soul" comes to mind after seeing this flim. (Alexander had become a real monster and tryant at the end of his life.)Altogether a great Documentary that takes the viewer to places where most of us can't or don't want to go to.(Mr. Wood went to Afghanistan when the Taliban was taking over the place to film the Afghan portion of Al's campaign there.)

I highly commend this book as I have worn out several copies of it in the past 10+ years. Its a pity that some one does not get off their duffs and make a decent movie of this series. The one effort with Roddy Macdowell came close but not quite.I just hope that we can read of Flashy's adventures in the War between the states that has been hinted at in the other books.

When you read a book like this and have seen the Army at its best and worst. That and have seen the gradual improvement to where the Army is today, i.e. one of the most trusted institutions and one of the greatest killing machines since the Roman Legions under the early Caesars. I just feel better and safer. That and I want to thank all those who did not turn tail and run away from the wreck of the post Vietnam War Military but stayed and fixed it. God Bless you all!

I really enjoyed this film about a man with such bad luck that he can kill any winning streak just by his presence. But as it will happen his luck changes for the better. A good lively and believeable film about the Old Las Vegas.

A book that is not afraid to take a good hard look at one of the most important early Church Fathers.I especially like it when it is mentioned that Augustine had trash and vegetables thrown at him for some of his sermons and conversion efforts. The Roman Army had to save the Bishop a couple of times from the Mob.One tends to forget and think that the conversion of the Pagans was smooth sailing. That and the mention of the fact that Augustine remained remembered was because of his library that survived him.

While this is a good story, there are a few problems in that the German Army was a lot more savvy than was shown in this film. Especially with Rommel's outfit. In real life the Germans would of quickly over run this outpost and with a lot fewer casualities. But hey this is a movie! So if you want to see a good WWII era war film then here you go.

One of the better books to come out about the "Golden Age of Hollywood". Niven gives a good and funny look at his career and the life back in those days. (The Sad part was that a lot of pain & sadness also followed him with the death of his 1st wife in a tragic accident & then marrying the wrong 2nd wife.He also sadly worked himself to death because of his fear of poverty.)None the less a 1st rate book about a real life of the party Man & great Actor. I think that Sandhurst must be proud of him!

The Good Colonel just passed on to the Big O Club in the Sky today. None the less he has left a great legacy in this book. To call it one hell of a story would be an understatement of the 1st degree. It is a classic story of a poor hard scrabble kid who goes out and finds himself a home in the US Army. Hack was really one of the lucky ones who found a place where he could really excel. I found myself actually feeling sorry for the Enemy and some of his idiotic Superior Commanders. He must of been a hand full is all that I can say.

So when did the "Dark Ages" change to "Late Antiquity" or are we afraid of offending someone who has been dead for over a 1000 years? Oh well!! Dr. Brown has written what I think is the best and most interesting book on this period I have seen so far. It is well organized, argued, with some lavishly & well chosen illustrations with that are well on point and supportive of the text. Good to go! I am just sorry I can't award it more than 5 stars.

This is a story about a poor humble man who finds a home in the Army. Who does the best that he can with what he has and does well. The problem was that he was born about 100 years too late. He is trying to save an Empire that is quickly dying and he is up against an Enemy that is finally getting his act together. Couple with politicans in and out of uniform who want an omelet but don't want any eggs broken. Who acted shocked yes shocked when he gets the job done! But at what a cost. This film would make for a good primer for those who would go into harms way in the 3rd world.

I am sorry but there is one over riding fact that you can't get around. No matter what we do, you are still going to die. This is just another example of denial of the natural stages of life by people who refuse to grow up.In spite of what we do or don't do. Heres what going to happen to every Mother's Son & Daughter every time. You are born , you grow up, you go into decline and then you die.So save yourself some money by following the golden rule and live a life of moderation. That & do your best and have some fun when you can. Bottom line is that there is no silver bullet that is going to make you immortal!

My 1st time that I saw this film was as a young wanna be GI. After the Army and as a Teacher I met &quot;Short Round&quot; who happened to become my Principal named Bill Chun. (A really good man and an excellent Principal.) He has regaled me with tales of his short Movie career and they were amusing. He had nothing but good things to say about the cast and the film. I commned it to you for a worms eye view of the &quot;Old Army&quot;. By the by Mr. Chun did a hitch in the Regular Army in the late 50's later on before going into teaching.

A very good book about an era that is really fascinating to me. The subject being the change over from the &quot;Classic&quot; era to the start of the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. It is during this time that the Legions change into Field Armies and Garrison Troops because of the pressures of the Barbarians and the ecomonic collaspe of the Empire. (I shall not go into the near constant state of civil wars between the competing thugs, nutters and other sods that wanted to wear the purple.)The Illustrations alone are worth the price but the text,maps are an added bonus. I have to agree with the other reviewer in the the B/W photos are the only down side of this book. All in all a very good buy for those with a taste for this type of history.

This film deals with the early days of our "adventure" in Vietnam. It showes the challenges of being a leader in a war that just seems to go around and around. It also showes some of the up coming problems that the Army faced. I.E. An out of touch higher command that could not come to grip with the nature of this war, a rising drug problem, careerist officers, a corrupt local govenment and a enemy who is everywhere and no where all at the same time. Couple with this an old time Regular Army Officer who wants to do the right thing and you have one hell of a good story to tell.

None the less they are some real warriors and studs.These 20 plus year old books are a real gem as they are usually well written and illustrated. This one being one of the harder ones to find

Another example of the early Ospreys in that they either have great illustrations or great text but almost never both. This one is a great history of the 3rd Regiment of foot that had its start under Queen Elizabeth I. To its history of service to the Dutch and its final return to service under the Crown. It is here that the Regiment really blossumed. Its story then became the story of the Empire until its final disbandment.A great story!

I am really surprised that Hollywood even allowed this to be filmed let alone be done so well. I liked this film really for 2 major reasons. The 1st being that it came really close to capturing the spirit of St Francis. Which is that of Joy and Happiness is really the greatest gift God can give us. That and Materialism is a trap. The 2nd being that one gets a taste what the Italian Middle Ages was like. For Example when Pope Innocent III kissed the feet of Francis, Francises feet are horribly dirty and calloused.Its a pity that a lot of his life was left out like his sojourne to the Holy Lands during the Crusades. (The Moslems treated him well and thought him mad)Also how the Franciscans even during his life time became bureacratic. But I guess you can't have everything.

I had read a little about Constantine the Great before, but this book filled in a lot of the gaps. It also made me extremely glad that I did not live during his period of time! While he justly deserve the title "The Great".(No one else could of pull off the stabilisation of the tottering and rotten Roman Empire as he did even for a little while or establish the Byzantine Empire)The reader also is made aware by the Authors excellent writing and storytelling skills of certain not so nice facts. In that Constantine was one very hard, ruthless and extremely dangerous man to have around. Just ask his murdered by his orders & hand Son and Wife. I just wish the Author had spent a little more time on the founding of Constantinople but hey you can't have everything! Right?

But if you want to know about the siege and sack of the city, then here you go.It does a good job tellings of Constantine XI, his forces and the Sultan and his troops. Its a sad story that was a disaster for Eastern Europe and shifted the center of power to the Atlantic States of Europe.

If you love films on the British Empire then you ought to think about seeing this one. Based loosely on Kipling's story, It helps capture a taste of the Brits in India & the Northwest Frontier. Somebody did their research and things just look right in this film. (Uniforms, equipment, the Mess and the Loyal Toast to the Monarch etc but then Massey did serve in the British Army before he started acting )The Brits never look more brave & noble and the locals more threatening.

Most Mercenary Troops are not what you would call top drawer people. Most having the most pressing reason not to hang around home. The reason usually involving a Woman or a Noose. Some of these outfits are noted for their draconian discipline like the Foreign Legion or the German Penal battalions of WWII. I would of not wanted to of been an officer or Non Com in those units. The Ghurkhas are another story and its a great story. From their war with "John Company" in 1815 to the present, The Gurkhas have set a very high standard indeed. As an example,It was a sight to see at Buckingham Palace in watching them mount Guard in place of the Guards. I just can't picture the Legion doing the same job in Paris. Of all the Regimental stories I have read so far this is near the top of the list. Mr. Farwell has done his usual good job of telling a good story about Englands Army and her late Empire.

It just goes to show how smart the Brits were to invent a military system that could enlist potentially hostile folks and have them fight and fight very well for them.A good solid regimental history of some great troops who gave the French some real nightmares in Spain. if you like this one then check out the one on the "Wild Geese". (I would of given it a higher score but the illustrations are not up to snuff)

This is one of the best books about one of Scotlands best known and toughest Regiments. It does a grand job in the telling of the story of two different regiments who thru a forced marriage become something greater than the sum total of the two products.I can highly recommend this one the text and illustrations are just 1st rate. It is well worth the money.

I found Moby's "God moving over the face of Water" to be very inspirational and touching. It alone was worth the price of this CD.

This is one of Ospreys very best early efforts. So if you want to be introduced to one of Britains best fighting Armies then get this one asap! I can not praise this book highly enough!

A good light read that introduces hopefully the author to a new generation of SF readers. If you like this one then go read "Lest the Darkness Fall" by the same author.

If you want to read a fitting tribute the 82nd and the Officers of it, then here you go. It is a good solid read but like his other Book on US Submarines it concentrates way too much on the Officers Corp. As a former Enlisted Man it would of been nice to hear a little more about the other side of the house.

Great illustrations and text, so if you like this book check out the film "Zulu". It will help you see what I frankly think was the greatest moment of this hard fighting Welsh Regiment which had a lot of good service to its credit besides its time in South Africa.A good addition to ones library.

The best book I have read about one of our most successful and colorful member of the Army Officer's Corp. The Good Colonel has done a great job of blending the big story & kitchen details with some telling points and insight.His writing skill and research are worthy of the highest marks. Altogether Good to Go!

I beg to differ in that I felt that I got my moneys worth out of this little book.It covers the basics of who, what, where and why very well. I especially liked the part about the selection of rifles for a pig hunt. As to pistols, I guess that I don't have the right stuff because I need to hit the target and hit it very hard. A highly urinated off pig can really ruin your day! Been there & done that! (Pistols are fun to shoot but I don't want to count on then when the chips are down.)

I rather enjoyed this book as it offers a very good alternative view to the campaigns fought around the Med during WWII. The one reason being that the Author had some very interesting kitchen details. For example, one reason Gen Auchinleck was not up to snuff against Rommel was that his wife had ran off with a "Brother" Officer.That and the rampant Tribalism of the various Regiments and higher command that weakened the 8th Army. "Monty" had to stomp down on this & the Officers Corp to get the army to play the same tune. That was really what I think was Montys greatest contribution to victory.I do not buy into his (The Author) denigration of Rommel. The man held off the best of the British Empire and the United States threw at him for almost 2 years. That is a very powerful fact to over come & the author does not overcome it.That & I disagree with his opinion of Patton and his efforts. But no one has or can really point forth a universally agreeded opinion for that Great Captain.That and I do not think that he went after Mark Clark hard enough. His glory ride to take Rome instead of knocking off the German Army should of caused his recall but that is my humble opinion.The really strong point of the book is in his coverage of the smaller countries and their background. I found his coverage of Greece was very interesting. That and his coverage of the siege of Malta was good and that Islands impact upon the North Africa Campaigns with their interdiction of the supply line of the Axis forces. (I still think that if Rommel had gotten a bigger portion of supplies, the Germans would of been enjoying the Brothels of Cairo)Another being how the Med was used as a proving ground of allied leadership and equipment with the weeding out of the weak sisters.This is a fact that generally gets overlooked and was a valuable factor toward final victory. A totally green Army would not of survived the Camapigns in Europe otherwise. Having some veterans and good leadership are critical to winning the fight.His closing idea that the Med sucked in the Allies to a tarbaby really rung true as the Americans are still there with a good size fleet patroling there today.All in all a good sturdy effort and well worth the money spent.

So what do you do when you are placed between several enemies? (A really bad C.O. that could teach lessons to Bligh, boredom & apathy in the backwater of a dying war)Do you just give up and go along? Or do you take the high hard path? The film shows the latter with a good man who by his basic goodness and commitment does the right thing. The bottom line being, that one must keep the faith, stay the course and fight the good fight no matter how bad the odds are.A timeless story that deserves to told again and again with a first rate cast that does it honor.

One of the few movies to address the colonial wars that we fought in the P.I.s. (Yes we have been fighting the Muslims for a long time now) Garry Cooper does a 1st rate job on a forgotten / ignored part of our military history.

This just another example of how good Americans are at making musicals. It is light, warm hearted and a fairly accurate film. While I won't claim its perfect as it does drag on at places. Its still a good movie to see on the 4th.

This is the place to go if you want to know anything about the Valley of Kings in Egypt. Mr. Romers love of the Past is quite clear. His presentation of the facts is well organized and on the whole presented in an interesting way. I just hope that he gets around to doing one of his excellent documentaries in DVD soon on the Valley of Kings!

If you really want to know the down and dirty about Homers tale, then you hit the jackpot. Mr. Wood in an obvious labor of love, goes forth in finding out if there really was a War on that windy hill in Western Asia Minor. The trail is a long and windy one from the Gold Fields of California, to Berlin and Greece. With a cast of characters that rivial a Chinese Opera. Altogether its well worth the money.

Mr. Atkinson has written another fine book about todays Army and its 1st real test by combat against Iraq. It is a rich source of information that did not make the screen by CNN. That and the story of the renaissance (rebirth) of the United States Military after the debachle of the post Viet Nam War. A book that is well worth the investment of your time if this is your field of interest.

Having had the priviledge of seeing 1st hand the Walls of Constantinople. I can safely say that this book is very accurate in describing them. To call them (The Walls) massive is an understatement. I just can not imagine the hard work and fear that inspired building them. But for them though there would be no Western Civilisation as we know them.

RSM Chappell has tackled a very interesting & complex subject in the form of the Scottish Regiments. I thought that the Text and Illustrations were 1st rate.Altogether a good over view that I think that the Author wanted to cover more but was limited by the scale of the series.

I frankly think that this is the best film made about the Civil War. Burns does a great service to all those who took part in the war and the nation that was shaped by our "greatest" War. As Shelby Foote so wisely put it, "It was a divide in the road and a hell of a divide it was". (The War basically made us the Nation that we are for better or worse and I like to think for the better)The use of the old photos and the actual terrain by Burns was frankly brillant.It really helps one gets a feel for what it must of been like and what the people of the war thought and behaved. I think that this film will be watched & enjoyed by future Americans a 100 years from now.

This was the 1st real Sci-Fi movie that I saw as a youngster back in the very early 70's. I loved it then and I love it now.While corny in places, it has a strong cast and for the time some great special effects. I especialy like the part where the little girl is found wandering in the desert in total shock. She only reacts when she hears the sound of the Ants. (Some really great acting for such a young child)That and its really neat to see Los Angeles back in the 50's. A great popcorn movie !
