Tired of just dealing with paperwork, analyzing intelligence information and being behind the scenes, Analyst Maxwell Smart wants nothing more than to become a Special Agent. And the "Chief" gives him his opportunity when Kaos starts systematically killing Control agents, revealing their identities placing them in danger all over the world. Newly promoted Special Agent 86 (Maxwell Smart), along with his capable partner, the very pretty "Agent 99" (Anna Hathaway) and his trusted and very sexy friend "Agent 23" (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) set out to save the world. Faced with danger and adventure, Smart proves that he is more than an analyst, but a secret agent to be reckoned with.This movie was extremely entertaining and funny. There were scenes that simply made me laugh out loud (the laser room, skydiving, throwing up in the face piece, or even "The Rock" running into a wall), and Steve Carell made a wonderful Maxwell Smart. And I even think that "The Rock" has a future in comedy. He is showing that he is a well rounded actor. Comedy, romance, drama and action adventure. With all that being said, I enjoyed this movie and think you will too.

The Reaping, starring Hilary Swank was interesting for a variety of reasons. Of course there was nothing terribly original. The plot involved biblical plagues, a child believed to be responsible for the strange happenings being reported, strange deaths and a disbeliever. I, on the other hand, looked at it from the perspective of "How would I react following a situation that rocked my spiritual beliefs to it's very foundation"? "How would I view God or my spirituality following a tragedy that rocked me to my core"? Or "How much can a person take before they break"?While the story revolves a Louisiana State University scientist who heads to the bayou to investigate reported biblical plagues. Water is turning to blood, frogs falling from the sky, lotus covering everything following the death of a young boy at the hands of his sister. As the story unravels, we find out that there is more to this small town that meets the eye.

I really enjoyed Sin City! Yes it was violent and gritty, but it was real and wonderful. I loved the visual stuff, the plot and the storyline. I thought Bruce Willis, Mickie Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were Brilliant! It reminded me of Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino had a little to do with this film and it shows)when you know the middle (because it is shown at the beginning), and you have to follow the story and arrive back at the middle and see it to the end. If you like movies like "Sixth Sense", "Pulp Fiction", and the "Others" (although that was not one of my favorites), you will understand and appreciate Sin City. Stated simply, everything is not what it seems.

If you are a Patterson Lover, and have not grown tired of the "I am Alex Cross and all my friends are either crazed killers who I am tracking and don't know it...or I have a ton of problems and yet still manage to solve the crime"...this tale is for you. After a much needed break [I had decided that I needed to give Alex Cross a little rest and enjoy some of Patterson's other works,like the winged people....now that was interesting and I enjoyed it] I picked up in the series where I left off....Big Bad Wolf. Unfortunately, after reading it I felt a little out of sorts and had to ask myself the question..."just what do I think of this novel?" I really had to search within myself and decide what was it that I just didn't get? Or is it that I got it, but wasn't sure if I liked it?Well for starters we still have the ever present Alex Cross, who has left the DC PD and decided to go Federal (FBI);then there's "Mama Nana" or whatever he calls his mother, who quietly states the obvious;his friend, Sampson who makes a cameo appearance and states that he is expecting a child; his absent girlfriend (Jamilla) who appears to be a little too mysterious for my taste at first, but appears periodically throughout the thriller (encouraging phone calls no less, hope she doesn't turn out to be a killer); Kyle (his psychotic ex-friend who use to work for the FBI); and a few others. Patterson also introduces new characters, like Monty (FBI computer expert, single with kids) and Mahoney (an eager partner who loves the excitement of having a partner who is willing to think out of the box....so I am sure he will either ultimately be killed or be the crooked FBI agent that is being paid off by the Wolf). Unfortunately, most of my rating is based solely on the love I have for Patterson's creativity and not so much about my love of the book. Although there was A LOT of potential (I loved the mystery surrounding who the Wolf really is) it was a little confusing. Patterson spent the first have of the novel introducing a sadistic, kidnapping couple and killed them early on. He introduced a concept of white slavery among the rich...which was interesting, but then it seemed forced by introducing so many other "bad things" that the wolf was involved in....it just all seemed a little FORCED. Oh and another thing, because I am not in love with the character of Alex's baby's mother, Christine, I did not enjoy her reappearance after being absent for over a year. I didn't care about her as a character and wondered why she was coming back. It just seemed that while Alex was trying to solve his first case while joining the FBI, he just didn't need the drama surrounding his exgirlfriend's decision to claim their son. Of course I know, and you will too when and if you complete it, that the whole book is set up for the sequel, but I am not sure that I want to read it. OK, I probably will!

Have you ever watched a movie and thought that was better than I ever imagined it would be. Well, although I have enjoyed a few Singleton flicks, I did not expect to enjoy this one as much as I did.The Mercer brothers return to their hometown of Detroit to bury a woman who loved them like they were her own. All four men, now brothers, were adopted by a woman, who did not care that they were different races with torrid pasts, but who loved them regardless of what they did. She instilled different traits in each of them in an effort to make them successful in life. Although, according to Terrance Howard's character, they were the only four kids that she could not "save" or find homes for. Anyway, these brothers are thrust together by their mother's death, and an investigation into who killed her and why. As they embark on a quest to find the truth they learn alot about themselves and grow closer. Through a series of conversations, we learn a lot about each character, and we see each of them fight their own demons, and navigate through self awareness as they solve the crime. We find that the love that they have for each is more than if they were blood brothers.This story will make you laugh (there are some funny moments) and cry (one brother dies), but the entire story will make you smile. The real journey is the one that begins when your heart allows you to love unconditionally, and that is the true point of the movie.

I liked this short, easy story by Linda Howard. Thirty-four year old, librarian, Daisy is on the hunt for a husband and has decided that she will make changes in her appearance and personal life to make sure that she accomplishes her goal. With friends and loved ones lending a helping hand, she has decided to start going to clubs to meet people. From the beginning, we see Chief Jack Russo (a big time city cop, who has semi-retired and become the Chief of Police in this small town) bully his way into Daisy's life and heart. And for a minute, Daisy did reminded me a lot of Blair in "Drop Dead Gorgeous", because she seems to be adding up Chief Russo's transgressions on a long list to be used against him at a later date. Anyway, while Daisy attempts to navigate the dating scene she sees something she shouldn't, and although she doesn't realize it, someone else does. However,it is my opinion that romance is secondary to the plot in the story. The other storyline is more interesting and creative. I won't tell you the plot, I will only tell you that for a small town a lot is going on. Corruption, human trafficking, undercover agents, drugs (GHB), and a list of other crimes that make this small town seem like the big city.The criticisms that I have about this story is simple, some of the storylines were not developed. Although we saw the romance bloom between Daisy and Jack, her fire dies down midway through and is overshadowed by other people. There were also other characters, like Todd or the Mayor's wife, who could have been enhanced. But I guess for a short, fast paced novel (although some considered it from the reviews slow in the beginning)you can't strengthen each storyline, and as long as the integrity of the story remains strong, it is ok.

Seth Quinn is a talented artist who has been living and working in Rome. Having conquered the art world, he simply wants the comforts of home...to be around family (his three adopted brothers) and those things that are most familiar. Abused as a child, taken in by his grandfather, he feels that he owes his brothers everything for the happiness and sense of peace that they have provided/given him. His brothers, who jointly own and run a ship building business, are just glad that he is home and spend no time welcoming him home. Imagine his shock when he encounters a woman (Druscilla Whitcomb Banks) that challenges him in every way. Dru has opened a flower shop and is not interested in a relationship with anyone, especially not a fun-loving, free spirited artist. Dru is tired of doing what everyone wants or expects, and she is still reeling from an embarrassing situation involved the infidelity of her ex-fianc&eacute;e. As a socialite and heiress, Dru is tired of doing what everyone expects and focuses on being a successful business woman. As the two set on a course to discover each other, there is something from Seth's past that has resurfaced and rears it's angry head. As Seth's dead-beat/drug addicted mother comes back to destroy all that he knows and loves, he must be willing to trust Dru and his family. And Dru must risk her heart again in order to find true happiness.What I enjoyed the most about this story were the dynamics of the Quinn family. While all of them were very different and extremely entertaining, they loved each other unconditionally. The conversations and dialog between them was entertaining and humorous. The differences between Seth and Dru's families are startling. While Dru's family's thrives on obligation and appearances, Seth's thrives on unconditional love and understanding. I also enjoyed the supernatural nuances that were woven throughout the book. Seth's conversations with his deceased grandmother (who he never met), provided him moments of love and advice, and provided some insight into Seth and his family.I have read several Nora Roberts novels but never read any others of the Chesapeake Bay Saga. Although this is apparently part of a series, I thought it was a nice "stand alone" book. There were explanations given for various relationships and storylines, so I never felt lost or confused. My only criticism was that the secret that Seth was keeping was not that big of a deal, so I never really understood why he felt so torn and confused. Overall, this was a quick and easy read. And while it was not the best Roberts story, it wasn't the worse.

Sweet, shy and slightly broken/psychic Victoria "Tory" Bodeen has made the decision to return to her hometown of Progress, South Carolina. Abused as a child by her father, Tory knows that returning to her hometown will be difficult. After all, her parents are outcasts and no one, not even the Lavelle's, ever understood Tory's relationship with prominent, wealthy and now deceased Hope. Coupled with that, Tory was blamed when her visions lead them to discover Hope raped and murdered in the swamp. Unfortunately, Tory's psychic visions never allowed her to see Hope's killer. Wanting more for herself and to escape the abuse of her father, Tory leaves Progress briefly and uses her "powers" for good (to locate missing children) until her heart is broken by a careless man. Wanting to find closure on her past, yet filled with hope for the future she returns to Progress to open a shop and discover who killed her childhood friend. With Tory's return, the Lavelle's lives are turned upside down. Cade (Hope's surviving brother) and Faith (Hope's surviving twin) each have definite ideas about what Tory means to them, one is falling in love with her while the other harbors animosity and jealousy about their relationship (Hope and Tory's). However, as time progresses and Tory becomes more entrenched in the community and in their lives, they both grow to understand and love her. There are other interesting characters in this dark drama: there was Wade, the town veterinarian who loves Faith for what she is. There are town gossips, a loving grandmother (who regrets the decisions her child has made, picking her abusive husband over her daughter), a sweet uncle (JR), Cade's zany Aunt Rosie (who shoplifts), Wade's caring mother (who only wants her son's happiness), a vengeful mother (Margaret), a loving housekeeper (Lilah) and town snobs. What I enjoyed the most about this dark, suspense story was Robert's ability to allow Tory to flourish and overcome her background. Although the odds were against her, in the end, she found true love and happiness. And while the story ended abruptly (we all could have had just a little more), I knew that Tory and Cade would live happily ever after because what had been broken in them both was now repaired. And finally what I really liked about this book, as I do so many other Robert's novels, is her ability to take a tragic story of lost innocence, betrayal and murder, and weave a decent story that leads to redemption. I really enjoyed Carolina Moon and would recommend it to any Nora Roberts lovers out there.

Apparently there is a serial killer on the loose (ok, that's not too original), but it's not exactly a serial killer but a vigilante/avenger on the loose (ok, because we don't like the victimd, we call it vigilantism, when we do like them we consider them to be true victims). Anyway, some pretty bad people, who have gotten off (i.e., eluded justice...among them a child rapist, pimp, killer, a molesting priest, etc) on technicalities are being murdered (actually gunned down with their own weapons). Assigned to this case are Turk (the sexy Robert Deniro) and Rooster (Al Pacino), who have tons of history and experience between them, and two rookies, Perez (John Leugizamo) and his dedicated sidekick Riley (Donnie Wahlberg). With converging storylines (there are tons of them....for example Deniro's romantic relationship with a fellow officer, played by Carla Gugino and Rooster's sketchy past), "Righteous Kill" was fairly entertaining. With plot twists and turns, this movie offers just the right amount of suspense (although I am sure that you will figure out the killer before the end) and mystery. And if nothing else, it gives you an opportunity to see "50 cents" play a music mogul/drug dealer (not a stretch, but always interesting to watch).

I have to admit, this was better than the last one, and probably as good as the first one. This book was better written and easy to understand. The only criticism I have is the romance, especially between Margo Green and Smithback seems forced. I understand that it is not a romance novel, but why throw it in there if it is not going to be smooth and believable. Anyway, I do love the fact that everything is explained (although I am not sure I still understance WHAT Constance Green is....really), but the rest is. I now know why Diogenes hates Aloysius (although it is silly) and I am glad that D'Agosta and Lieutenant Hayward worked it out. Now that I am writing this review, there were a FEW things that I didn't like....I really didn't understand why Diogenes picked on the poor curator for the magazine, and why no one suspected who he really was. However, I thought it clever the whole "reopening" of the exhibit to commit the ultimate crime. There were some good parts (Constance goes Rambo) and some not so great parts (Constance preggers), but I am not sure if I would read another in the sequel. I would rather the images of Constance telling her fate; Diogenes' appearing to shall we say "meet his fate"; a budding romance between Pendergast and Constance (although he mentions some foolishness about a monetary to get his thoughts together); and the rekindling of romance between Hayward and D'Agosta linger in my mind with old Eli Glinn and Pendergasts' sidekick backing them all up. Hopefully this is it, but with the cliff hanger, who knows. Uh...I thought I said one criticism, I guess it may have been more than one, but I enjoyed the novel. LOL

Set in the future, Remy (Jude Law) and Jake (Forest Whitaker) have a job to "die for". They repossess body parts when the clients/patients are unable to pay. Inflating prices and increased interest rates (they work for a large company whose bottom line is cold hard cash) have made the organ transplant business quite profitable.Childhood friends, Remy and Jake seem to enjoy their work (repossessing body parts without anesthesia), and go thru life kicking butt and taking body parts back. When Remy undergoes a life changing accident, he soon finds himself on the wrong side of a repo when he can no longer afford to pay for his new heart. Rejected by his wife, avoiding a greedy boss and eager co-workers, falling in love with a woman (who is more new parts than original), Remy runs for his life and hopes to bring the company down.Overall, I think RepoMen provided an interesting premise with a satisfying conclusion. There were startling revelations (that in the scheme of things made sense) and twists and turns at every turn. The music and scenery were riveting and to be honest I loved the futuristic story that analyzed loyalty, friendship and duty. I was extremely entertained and would rate this movie, a 4 to a 4 .

Someone is killing the homeless of New York, in the year 2058, and removing their body parts! As Lieutenant Eve Dallas unravels the mystery behind who is killing them and why (affectionately known as the "sidewalk sleeper murders"), she is forced to face an adversary who will stop at nothing, including framing her for murder, to get her thrown off the case. Torn between a love for the job, a pursuit for the truth, and fighting to keep the one thing that she REALLY loves, besides Roarke, her badge, Eve is stripped of everything, and for the first time in the series, we see Eve really vulnerable and hurting (even too sad to spare with Summerset, who we all know she has a love/hate relationship with). With her true friends support, Eve continues her journey in discovering the truth, no matter what the consequences. And we all learn how really important her careeer and badge are.If you love the "in death" series, you will love this book as well. You even get an opportunity to see Dr. Mira, Feeney, McNab, Peabody, Baxter, Webster (old lover of Eve's), and Commander Whitney. And I finally find out how Trueheart and Dr. Louise's characters are introduced into the "in death" series. [I must admit that I have not read the series in order, so finding out these things is always helpful]. I highly recommend this book.

I have read several of the books in the "In Death" series, specifically the later installments and for a while, have intended to read the beginning to see how the series evolved. "Naked in Death" was a wonderful building block for a series that I have grown to love. This books starts the evolution of the passionate relationship between Eve and Roarke. We see their acceptance of each other and their desire to find in each other something that they desire. They are willing to risk their hearts for love.We are introduced to other characters that appear frequently in later installments, but who I had no idea of how they joined the cast of a well developed series. It also explains that when we first meet Eve, she has hidden her secret in her subconscious and has no idea the impact that it would have on her future. We meet Mavis (Eve's best friend who is not yet the hip "Vid" star yet, but whose career is on the rise); Dr. Mira, who is pushing Eve to remember a past that she has chosen not to remember; Charles Monroe, a licensed companion (i.e., high class prostitute) who is later the love of Louise's life (Louise being one of her dearest friends). Sideline...I never would have known that Charles hit on Eve first, in a million years, called her Lieutenant "Sugar Pants" and even offered to give her a "freebie". [For those who follow the series, you will find that extremely surprising.] And finally, we meet the ever present Feenie, Eve's mentor and father figure (He even treats Roarke like a father who is dating his daughter. It is cute and they eventually come to an understanding). We see Summerset and how his relationship with Eve evolved, and find out how she comes into possession of Galahad, the peculiar cat, that is throughout every novel in the series. And most of all, we see Eve evolve into the woman that she becomes in "Innocent in Death".I guess I should mention the whole murder angle in the story. Eve is out to determine who is killing licensed LCs with antiquated weapons. The first victim is the granddaughter of a well connected Senator. On top of that, the man that Eve finds irresistable is a suspect. However, following her heart and believing in someone for the first time, is not easy. Unprepared for love, Eve navigates unchartered waters.I do intend to read a few of the others because I know that Peabody and McNab have to make their appearances in the next book or two because I see her in Immitation in Death. This will be the summer of fun reads.

Contrary to other reviews, I thought Freedomland was interesting for a variety of reasons. From the beginning, I knew that there were no twists to a reoccuring theme...mother (played by Julianne Moore)claims some "unknown" black man carjacked her, with her son in the backseat. Brenda Martin (Moore) is a recovering addict who appears to genuinely be "in trouble", although she does not act like someone whose son has been taken (she waits until the Detective questions her to tell someone). I immediately had images of Susan Smith and Charles Stuart, and knew what the end result would be. Because I work in law enforcement (work closely with Homicide and Prosecutors) I knew that they way they treated her and how the case was investigated were realistic in a lot of ways (the mother is the first suspect, especially if she acts out of character. I also enjoyed the underlying tension between the community and police, as it relates to race relations. Again, images of Stuart and Smith came to my mind. But what I found to be the most interesting was not the plot involving the mother but the underlying plot of Lorenzo Council (Samuel Jackson) who realizes that he might not have been the best father (his son is now incarcerated for armed robbery) and his role in the all black community where the suspected offender lives. I thought that those things are what merits this movie a 3.5 or 4.

I must say that although there were some incredible stunts and unrealistic scenes in the movie, I still thrilled in the fact that this was a well thought out, action, adventure story with a hero that I could believe. I love Bruce Willis and that crooked smile (I definately see what would attract Demi Moore) and his sense of taking a beating and keep on coming. Although John McClane was older and grumpier, he can take a punch or kick with the best of them. This installment in the Die Hard series finds John struggling to maintain his relationship with his college aged daughter. He has moved from being his daughter's hero, to being a disappointment. As he attempts to mend their relationship, he is also thrust into a situation where he has to save the life of a hacker. This story is filled with situations, that some would say are unrealistic, but that I say should give us food for thought. What would happen if there is a cyberattack and every industry that means something is effected? Finance, transportation, communications, and utilities. What if there were a firesale? Are we as Americans really ready? When John unravels the mystery of who is behind this mess, we find a bad guy and a bad, but beautiful girl. I really enjoyed this story and found it to be extremely entertaining. I even bought it to watch over and over on lazy Sunday afternoons.

Grecian King (King Leonidas) is fighting for his country, his love and his honor. Surrounded by 300 Spartans, who have been trained from an early age to fight, he heads out to stop the enemy, and uphold tradition. Encountering several other groups who are willing to fight (with not the same skills, but a lot of heart), King Leonidas faces characters that have different agendas and beliefs. There are greedy men, lots of deception, bloody battles, the refusal to surrender, betrayal (by those he trusts, loves and respects), and a "gigantic" bad guy in a cool costume. As the fate of Leonidas and his 300 Spartians is decided, you will be entertained by the plot, cool costumes and great special effects, which all lead to a decent and entertaining movie.

Although I would not say that "Beowolf" is an extremely original idea, I thought that the animated adaption (almost real looking) was very entertaining! Imagine King Authur meets Lord of the Rings, that's Beowolf, and there was much more which made this adaptation extremely enjoyable.The plot...there was a King (played by Anthony Hopkins)who gives into the seductive powers of a beautiful enchantress/succubus/Bad Girl (Angelina Jolie)and is cursed for his misdeeds by having a monster (really his son), Grendal, attacks his castle and kill his people. He sends out messages far and wide that "anyone who can kill the beast will be greatly rewarded". Enters, Beowolf (a man of vision, and a man of great strength with great tales of killing some of the most heinous creatures ever imagined)who says that he is up to the challenge and will kill the creature. Lusting after the King's wife, he sets out to kill the beast and confront it's mother. Unfortunately, it would appear that Beowolf is also easily seduced and we see him reaping the sins of his past. Filled with betrayal, lust, treachery, fight scenes and wonderful characters, we find a story unfolding and ending (not surprisingly with another fool being seduced by Jolie). Apparently, no Great King learns from previous mistakes. I enjoyed this movie, and would highly recommend it.

Ok, maybe I am a kid at heart, or maybe this movie wasn't as bad as I expected, but I really enjoyed "Wolverine". I thought that the story was easy to follow, well written, and full of surprises. For example, I had no idea (because I didn't read the comics and only saw some of the cartoons and the X-Men movies) that Wolverine was Sabertooth's brother (and I am not even sure that this was in the original storyline of Wolverine). I loved that twist and others in the story. And while I wouldn't say that the movie was exactly fast moving and action packed (don't get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes) ...I thought Origins did a wonderful job setting the stage for later X-Men stories. And I now understand why Wolverine has very few memories of his life pre-metal claws. We also got to see several of the characters from later stories (Gambit, Professor X, etc.) and understand how some mutants became X-Men!Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, and I liked Sabertooth's character as well. Understanding the Wolverine/Sabertooth dynamic is key I think, to later stories or even potential storylines.Now a brief synopsis of the movie.....As a young boy Wolverine discovers that everything in his life is not as it seems, and finding out that he has a brother is the least of his worries. For spending years fighting beside his brother has not prepared him for a future of tracking down mutants for his boss, a military man trying to cure his son (who has mutant powers), and eliminating them because they are threats. When Wolverine decides that killing and fighting isn't necessarily fun anymore, and maybe the person they are working for isn't what he appears, he leaves the organization and settles down as a lumberjack. The rest is a story that only you can appreciate if you watch it. Understanding the motives for people's actions is not always as clear cut as you would think, in this movie. There are tales of jealousy, greed, and power woven throughout. Anyway,X-Men Origins, had tons of great characters (interesting mutants with interesting powers) and a sweet love story to boot. I don't see why people are being so hard on this movie because it really wasn't that bad, or maybe it is because I was expecting a lot worse.

Lieutenant Eve Dallas does not, as we all know, want to remember her childhood. She is already plagued with memories of her father, and his demise at her hands. So imagine her surprise when her foster mother, Trudy Lombard shows up, full of fake motherly love, just to see how she is doing.Trudy, who is visiting New York days before Christmas(with a son and daughter-in-law in tow), claims that she has traveled from Texas because she saw Eve on the news talking about the Icove case. Of course it is obvious from the start that Trudy is only back to try to blackmail Eve or her insanely rich husband, Roarke. Would Roarke pay to hide what Trudy knows from being released to the media? If anyone knows Roarke from the series they already know the answer, and it is not because Roarke believes "his cop" is not worth $2 million dollars! For him, she is worth that and a lot more. So the adventure and discovery into the truth occurs hours later when after meeting with and being threatened by Roarke, Trudy shows up dead.The usual characters from the series appear and dazzle us as usual. Mavis (who is in her last stages of pregnancy), Summerset (who decides that they will call it quits for the holidays), Peabody & McNabb, Feeney, Nadine,Trueheart, Baxter, Commander Whitney, and a couple others (including the cat, Galahad). And we also find Eve struggling with the Christmas spirit, and Roarke's generosity. And although you won't be surprised who the killer is, you will love finding out about Eve's as a child and coming to understand her a little more. .

A male friend of mine is a Red Sox fan and found out that he is going to be the father of a "baby boy". What could be more perfect than this Boston Red Sox Baby Bib and Bootie Creeper set? It's 100% cotton, and perfect for his first few Red Sox games. And what they don't tell you (or maybe I was just caught up on how the front looks) is that right on the rear, there is a cute little baseball. What could be cuter than that? The quality was good and it looks well made. This item arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner.

I LOVED the Lincoln Lawyer, probably because I know a lot of defense attorneys and work in a local District Attorney's Office. Everything was clearly written and believable. The personal issues of the characters in the novel were also REAL and believable.Mickey is the typical defense attorney (marital issues, money issues, issues in general)who doesn't really want to know if the client is guilty or innocent, because long ago he became jaded and did not think he could recognize innocence when he saw it. Hint...an old client tells him of his innocence and he did not believe him and this is crucial later in the story. The story is cleverly written (600 pages which felt like only 100)and moves at a fast pace. I don't think the mystery in itself was complicated, I could figure out who the real culprit was, but the writing style and plot was what made the book so enjoyable. If you are remotely interested in the Criminal Justice System, you will love to see how it really works behind the scenes. The good and the bad. Read this book and enjoy!

Lell Pelham, the heiress to Pelham's Jewelry Store (I envisioned Tiffany's, but grander)is spoiled and getting married to Will, a playboy on the social circle. Julia Pierce, a beautiful saleswoman has been asked to deliver the infamous "Pelham necklaces" for Lell's wedding. Julia is shocked to learn that Lell has even noticed her, and never would she guess that "Lell would notice her". Lell is intrigued by Julia, who although beautiful would be the perfect person to morph into the social butterfly of the century....she would be responsible for taking someone from another class, but all the classic looks and changing her to fit what her idea of "perfect" is. Lell is joined in her attempts by Polly who is equally as manipulative as her friend. Julia, caught up in the excitement of a new job, new friends, new clothes, and fantastic opportunities finds herself slowly changing into someone that she never thought that she would (she feels attracted to Lell's new husband Will, who is pursuing her because Lell has started cheating on him, right after the honeymoon). There are extremely entertaining and interesting characters in this novel.Lell Pelham, heiress to a jewelry company, works hard to please her father while hating her mother. She knows that her father is unfaithful whenever possible, but relishes in the fact that he trusts her to run the family business. However, she too is fighting demons of (1) not letting anyone to close, even her husband. (2) Using money to keep people under her control. And (3) wants what she can not have.Polly, who we hate, but soon understands, is in a marriage (for convenience only); has a child (to beat Lell to the punch); has a husband who drinks and ignores her (and seems to have a secret); gossips non-stop, as well as starts trouble within the group and struggles with her relationship with her mother (who doesn't seem to want to acknowledge her existence)- seems to find out what is really important in life, after it is too late.Will, married to a woman who can give him everything that he wants materially, but she won't give him what he wants the most her heart. And I think that Will realizes that sometimes selling your soul won't bring you happiness.Oscar, the sweet misfit of the group, just doesn't understand the long conversations about fashion or what "dumb" benefit that everyone wants to attend, just for the sake of attendingHolly, the friend of Lell and Polly who seems the most down to earth. She is married to a wonderful man, and has two wonderful boys, and for a minute questions "what if"? But in the end,knows what things are important and clings to that.I really enjoyed this novel and would like to read another. I thought that it was whitty, and although I initially thought that I would never like a book that discussed this kind of topic, it was refreshing.

Well, I think my first mistake was comparing Forever Odd to the novel Odd Thomas. Odd Thomas was wonderfully written and you felt for the central character who came from a rocky upbringing (mother and father had real issues)only to realize that he has a special gift, he can talk to the dead. The dead can not verbalize what they were feeling, but he seems to make sense of what they are trying to say. He can see those who are in-between, those who could not let go of this earth and move on. And that is his calling to assist them with moving from this world to the next.In the first novel, Odd Thomas, we see his close knit friends band around him as he attempts to prevent doom from visiting his small town. However, despite his abilities, he can not prevent the death of his one and only love, Stormy. Stormy's character was interesting because among a lot of things, she is a victim of child molestation and believes that she and Odd are destined to be together. She also has a 3 part ideology about why we are here in the first place. I felt like crying when I realized that Stormy had been killed, and all Odd had left from her was her furniture and a tarot card that promised that they would be together forever....or something to that effect. She moved on and didn't waiver between the two worlds.Anyway, when I heard that Forever Odd was coming out...I rushed to get it. Just image an opportunity to see Odd's friends again: the father figure and police chief who understands and appreciates his gift; his over weight novelist friend who has a suspicious cat, but is insightful nonetheless, and the colorful people in the Grill again, especially his surrogate mother. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the novel Forever Odd and I really can not articulate why. I really did not like the storyline, or maybe I should say that the story was missing something. Afterall, you had everything that should have made this Koontz sequel one to remember. There was an interesting location for the novel....a burned down casino haunted with lots of restless spirits, a person who needed to be saved (and he had brittle bone disease to make it more interesting), reappearing characters that we love (novelist, chief and friend from the grill), the hope that Stormy would make an appearance and tell Odd that everything was ok (but I guess she is happy where ever she is because she did not appear), a cat who loves to pee on Odd's shoes, and some "seemingly" evil/bad people. All these things add up to success, but that is where the novel seemed to fall short....I just didn't get the evil people. There was a lot of talk about them kidnapping Odd's friend to make Odd show them spirits, but it was lacking in depth. So the lady was going around the country following supernatural phenominons in the hope of seeing dead people. So she owned a "sex" line and was wealthy from it. So she was gorgeous and her looks did not match her spirit. All this buildup, a beautiful/evil woman and two, no three evil jerks assisting her (2 zombies and a snakeman), only to have them, well die with little fanfare. No climax. And the whole scene of one of the guys sucking a little blood from the inside of the villian's hand was silly. Not to mention, the whole Elvis thing is getting a little lame.The reason I did however arrive at the rating of a "3" was because there were times in the novel that you simply teared up. The writing was so moving that you could not help but smile or cry at times. The best part of the book was when you think Odd is dead and visiting all of his friends, you realize just how special Odd really is. Odd is a true blessing and an "oddity" because he is something that few people are honest and good, accepting and understanding. He struggles daily with issues that others are not aware of and just imagine how much pressure you would feel if you were or felt you were responsible for so many lives. You would be a little lonely and sad too.At the end of this novel, I sighed, Odd seems to be headed to a monestary to think and get himself together, and we still see him leading a lonely existance at the end of the novel. And yes, there will probably be another novel Odd Thomas novel...something interesting at the monestary perhaps and yes, I will probably read it.

Maybe it was the hype of the movie, or Heath Ledger's untimely and tragic death, or both, but I was anticipating MORE. Ok, maybe it was the time of day that I watched it (almost 10pm) and I was tired, and a tad bit sleepy, or maybe I should have seen it on the big screen, in the theater, or maybe Bale's brush with the law distracted from the movie (although I don't think people remember that), but I was just expecting a little more. Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying that it wasn't good, but it just didn't knock me off my feet, like the first Batman did. It seemed that Bruce Wayne's character was really developed in the first one (Batman Begins), while it wasn't this one (he seemed at times to be just going thru the motions). I will admit that in Batman Begins we learn the genesis of Batman and his life as Bruce Wayne so there was no need to restate it, but none of the other characters were really developed in this one, we only got snippets into what led to their development. For example, you did begin to understand who the Joker was, but I don't think that there was anything to really explain some of his psychotic behavior besides the fact that he was crazy. The same goes for Dent's character...yes, I understood why he became "Two-Faced), but I didn't think enough was there really explain how a person who fought so hard for justice would suddenly (although the loss of a loved one could do it) turn so wrong.Quickly, I will add to my list of what I liked and disliked about the movie.1. While I don't think Batman "evolved" much, I do enjoy how Christian Bale plays the role. He effortlessly waivers between being a "playboy" (Bruce Wayne) and brooding/conflicted superhero (Batman). What I really liked about Bale's portrayal is that you can feel the internal conflict between being a superhero and being yourself. He constantly seems to be questioning should he continue his crime fighting ways/living with a secret/alone/no tangible family (with the exception of Alfred and Fox) or settle down and start a family (virtually giving it all up). I would seem being Batman costs Wayne everything including his love. And while he struggles to balance his desire to save "Gotham", with his desire to be normal, you sympathize. And while his dilemma is not different than Spiderman's, Superman's or any other super hero, you like his take on it.2. I know that people are going to comment, but I preferred Katie Holmes over Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes. I thought Katie bought a certain innocence that Maggie attempted to recreate but didn't do it successfully. Did that merit my average rating? No. Who played Rachel's character really didn't make a difference, although her character was vital to the storyline and explained the evolution of "Two-face".3. I still enjoyed Gary Oldman as the dedicated Police Lieutenant, and although I was saddened by his character's fate, I definitely think that he was one of the shining stars in the first Batman and in this one.4. To me, Heath Ledger gave an interesting spin to the Joker character. While Jack Nicholson was an effective Joker years ago, Heath seemed more tortured because he was not just a pretty face in makeup (with a drawn on smile), but a disfigured and relatively angry bad guy with issues.5. Gadget man Lucius Fox (played by the earring wearing Morgan Freeman) was brilliant and captivating as usual. I especially like the relationship between he and Batman. When the caped crusader (or is it masked) asks him to "create a suit where I can turn my head", I smiled. There definitely seems to be a mutual respect and admiration between them.6. Michael Caine, as Bruce Wayne's handy assistant (Alfred), and guardian of Batman's truth, was equally brilliant.7. Aaron Eckhart, as the dedicated and incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent was great, as was genesis to "Two Face".While I know some don't think this is necessarily the place to "review" movies, I do think that the "average" consumer would want to know more than "was the quality of this DVD worth buying"? When I look in Amazon, I want to know both what the movie was about and the quality of the product. Meaning I am buying the movie, not just the DVD itself. With that said, I have found that unless you buy the two disc editions, you are always going to be cheated on the extras. In the past, the extras were almost as good as the movie itself, but now, unless you pay a little extra (note the difference between $15 or so dollars, and $24 dollars), you aren't going to get the alternate endings, outtakes, interviews, etc.. So if you want all that, you will have to pony up the extra bucks to get it. I for one find that once I see a movie, I rarely pull it out (unless it is one of my absolute favorites) again and re-watch it although I have paid the money, which explains why I now go to "on demand" or rent it.But after all is said and done, I would give this a solid 3.5 or 4.

I must first say that I have only read a couple Moning books and I enjoyed this one a lot. I liked the fact that unlike Laurell K. Hamilton (who sucks)she did not throw sex in there for the sake of sex. My biggest criticism of Hamilton is that sometimes the story gets lost in all the sex for the sake of sex stuff. And the only reason that I am comparing is that they both discuss the Fae, Unseelie and Seelie. Moning was refreshing in that for once folks, an author is building a story. For those who think that Jericho is not romantic, I think they are going to be surprised as the story evolves. I love Jericho in that he is an enigma. We aren't sure what he is, but believe me, when he and Mac finally get together they are going to be something.Now, on to the review. At first you think the story is simple...girl goes to Dublin to find out who killed her sister. But as the story unfolds, you find that there is more than meets the eye. Yes, Mac finds that the world that she has left in Georgia is larger than she ever imagined, and that her sister had gotten in above her head. But what I liked the most was how Moning, took a girl, who in the opening of the book was sunning by the pool in a bikini, to the woman that we see at the end, killing Unseelie Fae. I liked the evolution of the character and the way the story is told, in flashbacks. No matter what, Mac is determined to find the truth and save the world (maybe) by locating a very bad book. Now, Jericho who I think is trying a little too hard to act like he doesn't like our fearless heroine, is looked for the same book and would like to use Mac as a "bloodhound" of sorts (she can sense things).As Mac realizes that there are things that go bump in the night (vampires, gray men, and things with multiple mouths that feed on women), she prepares for the ultimate battle between good and evil.I can't wait for the other Fever novels to be released. I think they will be worth the wait. I can wait on the sex, if the story is good and I know that it will eventually come when it should.

I must first say that I was "extremely reluctant" to accept Daniel Craig into my heart as the infamous, sexy and dangerous 007. I was very upset when they decided that Pierce Brosnan would not be back. A little history....I was a BIG Sean Connery fan, and could not stand Roger Moore or the other Bonds until Brosnan. He had most of the qualities that I feel Sean Connery has......he is suave, charming, handsome and a little mysterious/dangerous...and James Bond use to be Remington Steele. So, needless to say I didn't want another 007, just when I got use to this one. So imagine my attitude when I went to see this movie.......Daniel Craig was going to be critiqued harshly. Now with all that in mind, I must say I was pleasantly pleased. Although Daniel Craig's was 007, his spin on the character was completely different. And although he was not as suave as Sean Connery, he is just as romantic (Vesper love story crucial to the story), more so because he only tried to get with two women, versus a ton (each critical to the story). And more than anything, he was more believable than past Bonds. He would bleed, he got hurt, he was sensitive and completely human.This movie was great....the plot is well written, you love to hate the bad guy, you feel sorry for the hero, and I found myself beginning to embrace him as 007. I no longer view 007 as a "single" person, while for some reason in the past it seemed like writers wanted us to think of Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, as the same person. But now, I have come to see the title of 007 as a classification, similar to the position of Inspector and Detective. And I really found myself appreciating the fact that this Bond was so human. Casino Royale is worth watching, and I would love to see Craig in the role again, in the near future.

Every time I see a Nora Roberts novel that I haven't read, I grab it. I know that traditionally Robert's novels offer romance, suspense and easy to follow plots, and this was no exception.The story begins with infant, Jessica Cullen stolen from her stroller while her family tried to take Christmas pictures with Santa. Distracted for a moment by her distraught son, Suzanne is devastated to find her daughter is missing without a trace. Faced with grief and guilt, Suzanne eventually separates from her husband but starts a successful baking career. Imagine after several years of disappointing leads her excitement when she turns on the news to see a woman who reminds her of herself and her missing daughter Jessica. Enters, Callie Dunbrook, archaeologist extraordinaire, has been summoned to a "find" at Antietam Creek, the site of future homes. Faced with the fact that her whole life may have been a lie and she may be the infant taken years earlier, Callie must re-evaluate her entire life, and solve the mystery of who took her and why. Sent to assist Callie on their most recent discovery is Jake Graystone, Callie's estranged ex-husband who intends to woo her back. With support from Jake and a host of other supporting characters (a widowed attorney with a child, Lana; a newly discovered big brother, Doug), Callie is determined to discover the truth. As deaths start to plague the site, Callie and Jake soon realize that her abduction could be the catalyst of all recent events.I enjoyed this Roberts novel and would definitely recommend it to readers who like romance and suspense. It's a quick and easy read and has just the tight amount of twists and turns to keep you guessing, and a nice well wrapped up ending. I would suggest this Robert novel to all those that traditionally enjoy her works.

Someone is killing off women, in New York City, circa 2058, using the techniques of high profile, 20th century serial killers, Jack the Ripper, the Boston Strangler and Ted Bundy. And there is every indication that he does not intend to stop. Leaving taunting messages at the crime scenes, he baits Eve into a challenging game of cat and mouse. And once again, Lieutenant Eve Dallas finds herself on the trail of a psychopathic killer.In this installment we find Eve on the hot trail of a psychotic killer, and struggling to solve some difficult cases that have a lot of very powerful people as suspects. And on top of it all Eve is having to deal with a number of other issues, amongst them...Roarke's revolutions about his past (his new knowledge about his mother who was tragically killed) and an ex-girlfriend of Roarke's whose new boyfriend is a suspect. Peabody, Dallas' partner is studying for the Detective's exam, and feels more than a little scared about moving-in or cohabing with her lover, McNabb. And then there is a surviving victim who reminds Eve of herself...battered and left for dead, only to be a miracle and survive. And as we all know, Eve feels the pressure to solve every case and fast. She stands for the victims and the anxiety she has often makes her seem insensitive and angry. And finally, Eve is dealing with those neverending nightmares about her father and anxiety about Summerset's impending return any day from vacation. But no matter what the odds, Eve Dallas always gets her guy or girl.I really liked Imitation, and if you follow the series at all, you will enjoy it as well.

I would if pressed give this book a 3.5. Overall I thought the plot was good and well written. However, what I did have a problem with was the fact that there was a great deal of time building the puzzle/mystery, and then when it was revealed I found myself saying "I just don't get it,is that it"? It just seemed like a little toooo much effort, for toooo little results.However, I will not spend this time rehashing the plot, which most reviewers have already done, I will spend it briefly giving you an idea of why you should read this novel. Grace, the sole survivor of a massacre that occurred at a rock concert(known as the Boston Massacre), has been living her life for over 10 years with only her limp to remind her of the events of that fateful night (she doesn't really remember the incident or what really happened, only what people have told her). Having met her soulmate, and wonderful husband, Jack in France while she was recovering, she thinks life couldn't be any better. She has two small children and has become a successful artist. Anyway, her life begins to spiral out of control when she discovers an old photo in her picture order of her husband Jack with four other people, among them a picture of girl with her face crossed out. After she confronts Jack with the photo (which he denies any knowledge of), he leaves the house to never be heard from again. Grace doesn't understand what any of this could mean, and starts out to discover the truth. On the journey to the truth, Grace's life is influenced by several people, among them a grieving mobster (Vespa), who wants revenge; supportive friends (Cora); a killer confessing; a United States Attorney and brother who wants answers to who killed his sister; a crazed killer (Woo); a nosey neighbor who learns more than most about the truth; a sister-in-law with secrets to hide; and an interesting plot that begins to unravel leaving you with more questions than answers. With several killings and other evil deeds, the plot of why was Jack taken eventually comes to light. So even though you will still have a few questions at the end of the story, you would have enjoyed the winding road that you took to get you there.

I generally like the Kenyon books, they are USUALLY entertaining, easy to read and good. But this one just wasn't. I was really disappointed! I started the book several months ago, and put it down. That is so unlike me, and if you check out the reviews that I have made recently, you will see that I read SEVERAL books (LA Banks, Feehan, Nora Roberts, Charlie Huston, JD Robb, and countless others) in the time that I put it away, but I was determined to finish it, and finish it I finally did. The book really had everything that should have worked for a paranormal romance novel, a sexy dream God(Arik), a lonely but beautiful, intelligent PHD, heroine (Megeara "Geary" Kafieri), several other demigods/GODS who caused trouble (Hades, Kat, and countless others) and a story that many people would find interesting (the search for Atlantis), but what the story lacked was good character development and a plot. There were chunks of story that were boring and frankly stupid....we all knew what the ending would be, it just took too long to get there. There were also several hints that the main character or her teammates were not what they seem, but they never really explain what her dreams or ability to influence dreams really meant. Maybe this would have been better as a SHORT story, I am not sure. I know that I just find it difficult to get excited about reading another Kenyon novel. I have already purchased Dark Side of the Moon, and hope that I have not wasted my money. So although I am a Kenyon fan, I would not suggest reading this one! Trust me, all of the reviewers aren't wrong. And while I love to support, some things you have to well frankly believe others.

Although I found "88 Minutes" to be extremely predictable (meaning within the first 20 minutes, I had identified the killer), I rate it a 2. I will warn you that you will that identifying the killer is relatively easy especially for someone who watched these kinds of "cookie cutter thrillers".The Plot: Seattle Forensic Psychiatrist (played by the very talented Al Pacino) has become a profiler/successful professor following a very big case involving the very bad, although attractive, crazed serial killer Forrester (played by Neal McDonough). It was the Doc's testimony (along with the survivor), that placed the last "nail in his coffin". Of course the stage is set for a showdown between the two.Years pass and the eve of the execution is fast approaching. Guess what? Crimes are being committed with the same MO as the man who was convicted nine years prior. And even more surprising, the Doc is being framed and has been given 88 minutes to live. With both is personal and professional life in jeopardy, Pacino goes around accusing several people of murder while racing to save his life. As the list of suspects dwindle, Pacino realizes that the person who is threatening his life also knows about his past.While the movie was not the worse that I have seen, it could have been better. But for a Sunday evening, with only football as an option, it was decent.

This year my son decided to play in the Middle School Band. This was the perfect opportunity to let him use my husband's alto sax from his middle and high school marching band days. Unfortunately, my husband's case had been stolen so we were in the market for a practical, yet affordable bag. After reading several reviews and speaking to several people in the industry, we decided to try the Protec Contoured Alto Sax Pro Pac. It was just what we were looking for! It is sleek, compact, with lots of pockets (for the reeds, cork grease, the cleaning kit, etc). It is well cushioned/padded which protects the instrument. It was reasonably priced when comparing it to others on the market. This bag is also very versatile when it comes to how you will carry it. You can either carry it as a backpack, or with the shoulder strap, or in your hand. I thought that this option was excellent since most kids have to carry a backpack with books as well as their instruments. I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone.**Please note, my son is using a Conn Alto Sax and as a result has to flip the instrument (to place it in the cutout) because some of the keys are on the opposite side of the newer instruments. But it still fits into the appropriate area snuggly.

I for one love the apocalyptic movies. Meaning it's the end of the world, and either there is one survivor or a few, but the results are the same...people really discovering how to survive during the end of days. Ex-Military researcher, Nevell is apparently immune to the very real vampire-like virus that has completely devastated New York City (in the future). Alone with no one but his dog (his wife and daughter were killed), and a variety of strategically placed mannequins, Nevell appears to be handling solitude, as anyone would (with a touch of madness). In a city filled with deer, wild animals (they obviously got out of the Zoo), Nevell spends his days hunting those that are ill, and his nights hiding out in his well fortified home. Unfortunately, things change as we see other survivors and the very beings that Nevell thought were so unintelligent (and without meaningful brain activity) being more intelligent (well at least the leader) than first believed.I enjoyed this story, although I wasn't particularly fond of the ending. I think that in a time of great despair and hopelessness, we see a man that was able to survive, with his sanity (well not exactly) and his sense of purpose. And I really think that it takes a great actor, to be able to portray loneliness so well. Will Smith did a wonderful job!

This review may include some spoilers....Maybe I just needed a good laugh, or maybe I just accepted Hangover II for what it was... entertainment. I wasn't expecting any Oscar performances; I simply wanted mindless, stomach splitting humor which is what I got. The Hangover II proved for several hours of good fun. I personally thought this one was just as funny as the first. I mean what could be more hilarious as Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Mike Tyson singing. Anyway, Stu is planning on marrying Lauren (the love of his life). Initially he invites all of his friends, with the exception of Alan, to come join him in Thailand for the upcoming nuptials. But succumbing to pressure from Phil and Doug, Stu finally invites Alan to join them, which would prove to be the first in a series of steps that lead to quite the adventure.Once they arrive in Thailand, Stu has to deal with Lauren's father (who hates him and takes every opportunity to demean his future son-in-law); Alan's jealousy of Lauren's kid brother Teddy (a genius and Stanford Med Student); and Phil's attempts to plan a bachelor party. After all he remembers Las Vegas and doesn't want anything like that to happen again. As luck would have it, Phil, Stu and Alan wake up in Bangkok with (again) no memory of the events from the night before. The only things they know for sure is that (1) Stu now has a large tattoo on his face (that strongly resembles the one Mike Tyson sports); (2) they now are responsible for a monkey (who smokes and does other hilarious things); (3) Teddy, Lauren's little brother is now missing and all they have left of him is a finger with his class ring; (4) they are a long way from where they should be and must get Stu and Teddy back in time for the wedding; (5) Alan is bald; (6) Mr. Chow is still involved in some questionable things; (6) there is a monk, who has taken a vow of silence who witnessed the events from the previous night; and (7) they are in a great deal of trouble. It would seem that the Las Vegas events are tame compared to what they are don't remember experiencing in Bangok.I honestly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those looking for some mindless humor.

"Born in Death" by JD Robb is wonderful, and a slight departure in my opinion from the other "In Death" novels in series, in that for the first time, Eve and Roarke's pasts are seldomly mentioned. Although Eve dreams in this novel, it is about "fanged and flying babies" because she has anxiety about being her best friend, Mavis's birth coach. And there are only a few mentions of Roarke's mother. And believe it or not, although Eve can solve some of the most heinous crimes reported in 2059, she finds herself a little horrified about watching the impending birth of Baby Freestone. And because he loves her and her friend Mavis, Roarke finds himself viewing child birth vids.So, while preparing for a baby shower and taking classes to be a birth coach for Mavis, Eve finds herself the primary investigator in a double murder. It would appear that while Natalie Copperfield and Bic Bison were very apt accountants, for a prestigious accounting firms, they also stumbled into something that they were not suppose to. While trying to unravel the mystery behind their deaths, Eve finds herself promising to find Tandy Willowby, a close, very-pregnant friend of Mavis. Mavis, afterall is distraught, that just days from her baby shower and delivery, her friend, Tandy has gone missing, and she only trusts Eve to find her. Coupled with all the usual pressure is the bureacratic wheel at the NYPSD implying that her husband, and part-time civilian consultant might take information that he stumbles across from this case and use it for his personal gain. Outraged, the two battle over how to handle the situation....Eve, hating that the department is questioning both her and Roarke's and Roarke hating the fact that he has done everything to assist the department, against his nature, and they still question his character (would he really use information that he learns from his wife to further his holdings or empire?..absolutely not..Buggers that!!!).While navigating married life, arguing with Summerset and attempting to juggle two cases, Eve is tired and worn out, but determined to get to the heart of the matter. Although it appeared on the surface that the cases were not related, they were, and an eventual plot of baby stealing, tax evasion, international crimes and murder come to the surface.Although I would not say that this was my favorite in the series, I will not say that I did not enjoy it. I love seeing the stead characters in the series, McNabb, Peabody, Mavis, Leonardo, Dr. Mira, Summerset, Galahad, Braveheart, Baxter, Feeney, and Commander Whitney, and finding out what happens next. I can't wait until the next installment is released.

There are two things that I love in this world....reading and playing scrabble! Now, imagine my delight when I saw that there was a scrabble board that (1) would not only hold your tiles in place, but (2) you could turn the entire board in the direction of the player whose turn it is. So although it is the same old game (the new scrabble games come with directions about how you can make "q" words without the letter "u"...although I am not convinced about that advice), there are definitely a new variations on the theme. I love my scrabble game and whenever possible I make guests play with me. There are no spills or movement at all! It's great.

To break up the monotony of their marriage, their jobs and date night, New Jersey couple Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) throw caution and commonsense to the wind and go to an exclusive restaurant in the City for dinner. Having failed to get a reservation early, they steal another couple's and the shenanigans begin. Two men approach them and suggest that they have stolen something from their boss (Ray Liotta). Once they escape and head for the police station, they soon realize that the two people chasing them were copes and therefore believe "no cops" can be trusted. There are ensuing car chases, shoot outs, crooked cops, bad politicians and other hysterical situations that all produce a few laughs and made for a decent movie. I was entertained. After all, I didn't have to think too hard. The story was simple, short and to the point. The characters and actors were a riot. Mark Walberg (who must have refused to wear a shirt) had an opportunity to show his comedic talents via his interactions with Carell (who constantly asked him "for the love of God" to put on a shirt) and Fey (who acted all googly-eyed, goofy, and constantly batted her eyes). Common and his sidekick (Jimmi Simpson) were perfect as crooked cops (little dialogue but always physically present).Taraji P. Henson, acts well as the cop who knows something isn't right but isn't sure what it is. William Fichtner was the perfect "dirty" DA. And as the two try to make it home safely (to their kids, and now it would seem their perfect lives, which don't seem to be boring any longer), they realize just how extraordinary and in love they really are.

I did not enjoy this novel as much as "Good in Bed" which was one of the best written novels that I have read. It was funny, witty and truthful, no matter how much it hurt. But "Little Earthquakes" was just ok....but not great. I gave it 4 stars because well..frankly, because I like Weiner. I think she tackles topics that are difficult and adds just the right amount of humor to make you appreciate them.The story is about 4 pregnant women. Each facing the challenges of motherhood, their careers and their relationships. These four women face issues of infidelity,children in failing health, overwhelming mother-in-laws, neglected husbands and other topics that I am sure people face on a daily basis. What I think that the book was lacking however, is the ability to have you care about a single character. In Weiner's other novels, there was one central character who you grew to know and understand completely. In this novel, there were so many characters, that you did not feel drawn to any of them.But all in all, this was a pleasant read.

I have to admit that this was my first Sue Grafton novel. I am not so moved by her writing style or the main character to jump on the bandwagon, go to the bookstore and buy them all, nor will I rule that out that as a possibility in the future (Hey, I could just run out of things to read and pick another up). It wasn't that the story was terrible (trust me I have read worse....a la Laurell Hamilton, not that this is anything like her stuff, but I have read worse), I just felt something was missing. I am not sure if it was the attempt at confusing the reader with red herrings about who the killer was, or was it simply a little dry. And maybe in the back of my mind, I was secretly comparing it to Edna Buchanan and her series which has a female reporter on the trail of killers in every book. Her novel seemed to have what this one didn't and what that exactly is, I am not sure.Anyway, what merited the 2 star rating? In general, I liked the concept....A middle aged woman (Daisy) seeks closure about the disappearance of her mother (Violet Sullivan), 34 years later by hiring a private eye, Kinsey Millhone. The entire novel, done through a series of flashbacks (1953 and the present, late 1980s) attempts to let you see small town living through the eyes of a promiscuous woman and it's residents. Kinsey has a week and $2500 to determined what ever happened to Violet (who was last seen on the 4th of July), her pet Pomeranian or her brand new car.There are a series of characters who all seem to have a piece of the puzzle. They range from an abusive/alcoholic husband (Foley), who now lives in the bottom of a church; the owner of the "Blue Moon" (who seems to know who Violet has been with); Liza (Daisy's baby-sitter); Daisy's best friend (Tanny); and several ex-lovers (car salesman, flim flam artist, etc).While other novels will weave a wonderful tale and not throw in too many useless clues, this one did. At the end, once the killer was revealed, it still wasn't clear why he/she (don't want to give it away) Violet? I was extremely disappointed, I really wanted a conversation about why...the big reveal....the real story.....but it never happened. So, I wouldn't necessarily say that I would recommend it, but if you want something to read, and you are willing to overlook the deadends, you may want to read it.

Lieutenant Eve Dallas is after a killer who has a flare for romance and murder. He sets the scene with care....pink rose petals, champagne, caviar and sexually enhancing drugs, to make women plyant and willing. The only problem is that he is killing them, and it would appear that he is tallying up bodies quickly. Dealing with her past and all of the nightmares/memories it produces, Eve must battle evil (once again) while juggling her cases and her sexy husband, Roarke. This time, her opponent is both diabolical and creative, and apparently has computer skills (to rival Roarke) and money (apparently the drug, [...], is extremely expensive and hard to obtain) to keep her at bay, but not for long.We also get another opportunity to see the whole gang, and smile at the all too familiar Peabody and McNab. Fans also learn in this installment, how Louise and the sexy LC Charles got together. I think this is one of my favorites in the series, and loved seeing Summerset, Trina, Mavis, Leonardo, Feeney, Galahad and Whitney again. It was definately a must read

It is my opinion that Season 3 of Nip/Tuck lost its appeal. What use to be edgy and creative, now seems redundant and silly. The writing is now starting to feel forced, although I am trying really hard to hang in there. Sean is more confused than ever. Christian is still being Christian. Julia has become irritating and opened a "spa" with Christian's old flame. Matt, Sean and Julia's son, has become down right stupid. While you were once sympathetic, you now frown and suck your teeth. He has become pathetic. And the main storyline, for two seasons now, The Carver is finally revealed and I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. I mean for several episodes, we have had buildup, creative storylines and some clues as to who the dastardly villain is, only to have a twist thrown in there that on the surface would have been better they taken a different avenue. This season, the attempt to push the envelope simply didn't work for me. Hopefully the writers will find their old magic and start writing well, instead of just ok. I for one am a fan who doesn't just want all edge and shock, but some of the old charm of past seasons.

I am absolutely hooked on the "In Death" series by JD Robb (AKA Nora Roberts). I think that they are fresh, creative and entertaining. I really love the characters and look forward to what will happen with them next. This installment has everything that makes for a good read.....The plot is simple without giving too much away.....there is a psychopath/sociopath who is beating, multilating and killing brown haired girls in New York in the year 2059. He leaves his victims with red ribbons tied around their necks and their eyes removed. Yikes. Meanwhile, you have a psychic (Celina)who is attempting to assist Lieutenant Dallas decipher who is responsible for the deaths and why? But as you watch Eve unravel the mystery, you are able to see those characters that we have come to love so much, as well as see Eve and Roarke's love blossom and grow stronger. And any visit with Eve, Peabody, McNabb, Roarke, Mavis and Summerset is definately worth a read. I can't wait to read the next one.

This, the second in the "in death" series, but not the first that I have read. I have decided to go back and start at the beginning, and unlike some reviewers I am enjoying the ride. In "Glory in Death" Eve is once again after a psychotic killer, who has killed a prominent District Attorney and an aspiring actress. As the plot thickens, we find Eve doubting herself and her growing relationship with Roarke, the sexy billionaire. Feeney is ever present; Mavis is growing into quite a talent; Dr. Mira is continuing to profile killers while struggling to have Eve trust her (she too has been victimized); Summerset (has struggled to get along with Eve from the first time they met); Galahad, the cat is still eating tuna; Commander Whitney is stern and fierce and Peabody is finally introduced into the series. But the ultimate theme in the book is: (1) Will Eve finally commit to Roarke?,(2)Will she catch the killer before he catches her? I think "Glory" is a wonderful installment in the series. I recommend it to all.

As a child, Bounty Hunter James Conner saw his father killed, and fled leaving his home and the love of his life. Returning years later after fighting in the Civil War, James is planning to wed his lost love and exact his own brand of justice on the evil land baron, Will Tunney. Returning to Legend, New Mexico and capturing the one who ruined his life doesn't prove as easy as he thought. While I was excited to get a movie thru the Vine Program, I was a little disappointed. "Shadowheart" wasn't as good as I had hoped. The cinematography wasn't that exciting, the music wasn't that good and it was kind of low budget. I am not even sure if it was worthy of being shown on the Lifetime channel. However, what merits the "2" rating, was the ending. Like traditional westerns, this ending wasn't flowery or pretty, but believable.

I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I mean what potential...Demi Moore and Kevin Costner! However, that is where the magic ended. Costner (known as Mr. Brooks) is a successful businessman by day and a serial killer by night. Soon he realizes that during his most recent escapade someone has seen him and "wants to learn how to be a killer". I thought that that was the dumbest thing ever. Someone would see a murder and want to be become a killer. On top of that, Demi Moore is an ambitious, rich detective who is going through a divorce from her "pretty boy" husband. Meanwhile, Mr. Brook's daughter is caught up in troubles of her own, that only add to the mystery. As the tale unfolds, the plot continues to disintergrate into a series of misfortunes. There was potential in the storyline, but it fell short by the end. I thought that the storyline involving Demi Moore and her divorce was stupid, and really added nothing to the storyline, with the exception of a forced plot. If someone has it and wants to loan it to you, see it. Otherwise, save your time and money.

Season 2 of Nip/Tuck was definitely not a disappointment. As we delve further into the world of McNamara-Troy, we learn a little more about what makes the talented surgeons tick. We are allowed complete access to their dysfunctional lives. Sean has learned that his entire life may have been a lie, perpetrated by his best friend/partner Christian and his loving wife, Julia. We see his confused son, Matt (who looks surprisingly just like Michael Jackson) struggling to become a teenager. Christian is still bedding everyone who moves, but we come to understand a little bit more about him. Although he is "beautiful" on the outside, we soon learn that Christian is merely an insecure man who truly only wants to find love, from wherever he can get it. And Sean, no matter what Christian does will always love him like a brother, although he definitely doesn't agree with everything that he does. And while dealing with other bizarre and complicated medical procedures, we find that a nasty serial killer (nicknamed The Carver) is on the scene and wrecking havoc. As we learn a little bit more about the ambitions and insecurities of the characters, we come to not judge them, but appreciate and understand what drives them to do the things that they do.

Typical Krantz formula = An eye glass wearing beauty with some paranormal skills + the macho guy investigator with paranormal powers + the cat + a bad guy with issues + a secret government agency + some murders.Shy, eye glass wearing, green eyed beauty (Isabel Wright) has some unusual paranormal powers (she is a Level 5 lucid dreamer) and works for the Belvedere Center for Sleep Research. One night, while working late, she stumbles upon the body of her beloved boss, Dr. Belvedere. Told that the Center no longer needs her services, after his son takes the helm, Isabel is wondering where she'll find work to pay for a storage room of furniture (worth thousands) that she has purchased in hopes of buying a house. Moving to California, she decides to accept a job at her brother-in-law's company giving motivational classes on dreams and reaching your potential. Meanwhile, Ellis Cutler, a dark sunglass wearing, Mazerati driving, Level 5 lucid dreamer Investigator, has been sent to offer Isabel a job with the very secret, government agency, Frey Salter, Inc.. Unbeknownst to her, Salter Inc has utilized her skills while she was working for the center. Although instantly attracted, the two must solve the mystery of who is behind some "mysterious plot", while learning to trust each other. Of course, Isabel instantly trusts and loves (fixing vegetarian meals on a dime), while Ellis (who has a fear of losing those he loves, or letting anyone into his heart) is a bit slower coming around, although we know it is only a matter of time.As the sparks rise, and the body count rises, Ellis believes that it is his nemesis (who is believed to be dead following a showdown that left Ellis injured) that is behind the deaths. As Isabel and Ellis sort through the clues, they realize that there could be more going on than they initially thought. There are secret (dream) formulas, bad guys with scars, and other mysterious events that make this resemble other Krantz mysteries. Of course, there are various sub-plots, like Frey Salter's leader troubled marriage, Isabels' sister's marital problems, and a vengeful twin brother (who wants the truth about his sister's death), not to mention a cat(Spinx), all of whom are ever present in the story. What this story really lacked were any real surprises. Even the eventual reveal of the killer wasn't shocking, nor was the ending. So if you asked me, was this the best Krantz novel that I have ever read? I would say "no", but it is a mindless - "you don't have to think hard about book", that would be entertaining while you lay by the pool.

I loved this movie and can not say enough how entertaining and thought provoking it was. First, if you like the concept of Crash, that everything is linked or related, you will love this movie. Second, if you want to see a movie that has action, suspense and some intense characters, you will love this movie.Joey (played by Paul Walker) is told to get rid of a gun that was used during a very horrific crime. Unfortunately, things spin out of control when his son, Nick and an abused neighbor, Oleg take the gun. Tired of his father abusing him and his mother, Oleg shots his father. There are a series of misadventures involving the gun, Oleg and Joey's attempt to regain possession of the gun, but eventually the watcher sees where every event is linked and the impact of this one incident has repercussions on all of the characters involved. And there are some particularly disturbing scenes when Oleg mistakenly gets into the wrong car trying to escape his father. Therefore, if you liked Smokin' Aces, Crash, The Usual Suspect, Pulp Fiction, Sin City and other movies that have the flashback, flashforward style, you will not be disappointed. And besides, there is a decent plot to boot!

Have you ever stopped breathing and yet continued to turn the page because you want more. That is what "Sugar" does to the reader. From the 1st page, where we find Jude a child killed following a rape, until the end, when we see Sugar fighting for her life, I was spellbound. This novel was filled with imagery, so vivid that you can see, smell, touch and hear everything around you. You understand the pain that Pearl is experiencing over the loss of her child, and you understand her attraction (not sexual) to Sugar, who she sees as a second child. Sugar embodies all that Jude could have been....loving and whole. But Sugar has her own demons to overcome, but with Pearl's help, they all will survive.McFadden's a master at imagery and truth. Read it and enjoy. You definately won't regret the journey.

Maybe my expectations were set a little too high. After all, there were some, who I consider A-List actors.....Susan Sarandon (Bull Durham, Thelma & Louise, Stepmom), Michael Douglas (Wall Street, A perfect Murder, Romancing the Stone), Danny Devito (Sunny in Philadelphia, Throw Mama for a Train), Mary Louise Parker (Fried Greed Tomatoes, Boys on the Side), and the promise of a decent plot presented with a touch of humor and a little something else (can't think of the word...but a secret ingredient), that would make an almost 2 hour movie fly by in what seemed like minutes. I thought , from the description that it would be a thought provoking dark comedy kind of like "As good as it Gets", "It's complicated" or "Something's Gotta Give"....but it wasn't. What ever those movies have in common, with the exception of Good Old Jack, was what Solitary Man was missing. I expected a movie the chronicled the rise and fall of a solitary man, but also his rebirth into something greater. After all, isn't that what watching a movie should do, give you hope? I guess I expected to find some redeeming quality that endeared me to this character, but there wasn't one. I didn't like him and really didn't care what happened to him. Instead, I got a movie that in the end I found myself confused and had to rewind to see if I missed something and ultimately muttered "is this what I spent 2 hours of my Sunday watching".Ok, maybe I am being a little harsh, so I will give you a brief synopsis of what the movie was about. Ben (Michael Douglas) was a car dealership owner/mogul who finds himself trying to rebuild his career (hence his life) after making some poor/bad decisions, of which he hasn't stopped making (like sleeping with his girlfriend's college bound daughter, who he takes to the college where the library is named after him). Of course, there is some foreshadowing of "something" that caused this change in his character, but it is was not clear after a few short clips of some meaningless dialogue between Ben and his doctor. Now borrowing money from his disillusioned daughter, waiting or hoping for his big break (back into the business), and juggling his failing relationships with his family (his daughter is becoming disillusioned about her father), he returns to his friend (Danny Devito) in hopes of "finding what he has lost". And in the end, after coming to no real "realization" about his role in his undoing (although he never really sees himself as the victim), you realize that all the mistakes that he has made in his life was because he fears death....well, maybe I am making these revelations sound clearer than they were....it came off more like we realize his fear is that he doesn't want to know and isn't willing to face his own mortality. Ok, I may have completely misinterpreted the movie, but it was extremely disappointing. While there was stuff that could have made this story redeeming, there was really nothing to give me some kind of hope. Maybe I was just looking for more, but if you were to ask me, I wouldn't recommend this movie. It was definitely not Douglas' best work.

**Some of this review may include spoilers.Jack Lonergan (played by Daniel Craig) wakes to find a metallic cuff/weapon on his arm and no memory of who he is or how he got there. As he struggles to remember, he finds that he has to protect the world from an unknown threat. Along the way, he must align himself with Woodrow Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford) a greedy cattleman whose sole job seems to be protecting his spoiled son, some superstitious Indians who blame the white men for this new threat, and the beautiful/mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde) to defeat a new threat, aliens seeking gold.The pros of this movie: There were some amazing and established actors involved. The setting (in the Old West) was extremely compelling. After all, what more could you ask for than a battle between the aliens and the earthlings......laser-like weapons against Old West weapons (i.e., arrows and guns)? There were plenty of gunfights....some you simply got lost in the battle scenes and scenery. There were even men on horseback fighting aliens in fast moving space vessels. The special effects were great and in and of themselves worth a 4.The cons of this movie: With so much talent available to this director (Craig, Ford, Wilde, and several more), it was the plot that lacked real bite. I felt that gold seeking aliens was (for lack of a better word)... pretty lame. Why would aliens who have access to any and everything, want earth's gold? I mean I would have rather the aliens wanted us for food (which isn't original but more likely) or the desire earth's most valuable resource, water like a lot of other movies and novels. Really I would have appreciated them wanting anything but our gold. It seemed that the aliens could have arrived on earth and taken secretly what they wanted without snatching humans and turning them into mindless beings. I don't know, I just thought that while I didn't expect this movie to win an Oscar, with the caliber of actors involved, it could have been better.

Have you ever watched a show so powerful that you can't wait until the next episode? Among a string of wonderful new shows on the FX Network, Nip/Tuck was a jewel! It is edgy, brilliant and definitely well written. And I love the fact that there is always some plot twist that was completely unexpected.For an hour (probably more like 35 to 40 minutes) you enter a world the superficial world of brilliant Plastic Surgeons Sean McNamara and Christian Troy. Beginning each consultation with "tell me what you don't like about yourself", they set out to fix or improve those things that their clients hate about themselves. Everything it appears can be fixed with the services of a fine surgeon and a scalpel.Sean (played by Dylan Walsh) is the more talented Surgeon whose life appears on the surface to be perfect (2 kids and a loving wife, Julia). Conservative and straight laced, Sean is the perfect alter-ego to sex crazed Christian. Christian (played by Julian McMahon of Charmed) is the more sophisticated of the two, but finds himself "bedding" one woman (and sometimes two) in every episode. Having one meaningless sexual relationship after another, appears to interest him more often than a complicated surgery. Liz, their anesthesiologist and friend, is constantly trying to show Christian the error of his ways, while assisting them both by performing some very complicated and creative surgeries. Soon you will find that the creative and wonderful storylines have pulled you into the dazzling world of McNamara-Troy, and you have simply fallen in love with this wonderful show, and looking forward to every episode. I can only hope that Season 2 lives up to Season 1. I am extremely pleased that FX took a chance on this series, because the world is definitely ready for it.

This is my first Huston novel, but I must admit, I will definately read another, especially if it is a continuation of this one. I really, really enjoyed "Already Dead"...it was gritty and well, an easy read. So as not to give too much of the plot away, I will tell you only a few things about the novel....Joe Pitt (a man infected with the vampyres while engaging in some risky behavior) is searching for a missing girl, while hunting a carrier (person carrying the zombie virus), while struggling to remain independant in a city where the zones are controlled by different vampyre factions with very different interests (some are rebels, buddist, mobsters, etc). But what I found to be the most endearing plot in the novel was Joe's relationship with his girlfriend, who he has not slept with because she is HIV+ and doesn't want to "infect" him. What we see is that Joe struggles with not "infecting" her, remember his vampire blood would cure her HIV+ blood, but make her immortal and like him, a vampire. I found that this was what was so ironic about his life, it would be so easy to cure her and turn her, but he doesn't. Instead he accepts his circumstances and loves her without consummating the physical element of the relationship.I hope that Hurston makes this a series because I would definately like to see what eventually happens to Joe Pitt.

First, I must tell you that as a child I loved the Indy series. They had action, adventure, light romance, and simply tickled the imagination. I also realize that in these times of "special effects", a simple story of action and adventure may not appeal to the masses. Here in lies my dilemma, I liked the series as a child (not to mention several others like Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Knight Rider, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Murder She Wrote, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, The Goonies, The Gremins, Star Wars, and other 80S, 90s TV shows and movies...I could go on and on and on, but you get my drift) and therefore knew, when compared to what sells today, this would be a hard sale. A continuation of a much loved story, with an older star and special effects to an old theme. Compared to Matrix and the recent Star Wars movies, this seemed to be not as exciting, but for those who love the traditional action adventure movies, they will be able to watch it and have no other expectations but to be entertained. While I do not think this is the best Indy ever, I wasn't as disappointed as other reviewers seem to be.Now the review, which will be short and sweet. Indiana Jones (Professor by day, Adventurer by night) is still an adventurer who is able to use a whip better than those half his age. Captured by those "dastardly Nazi's" who are searching for the remains of an alien, who crashed in New Mexico, Indy must find the crystal skull which will lead to the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull and the City of Gold. Of course during his search, he encounters more Nazi's (including Kate Blanchett who sports a mean bob), double agents, old friends, old loves, a possible son, is the victim of nuclear testing, aliens and so much more. So, with all that said, I give this latest Indy adventure a "3". I wouldn't purchase it, but as a rental on a Sunday, with nothing else to do, I would give it a whirl.

"Voices from the Other Side: Dark Dreams 2" is a brilliant collection of short horror/paranormal stories written by some of the most talented and phenomenal authors of our time. I absolutely loved each and every one for totally different reasons.Harlem - A crazed killer (Harlem, and the name has meaning) falls in love and plans to right what he considers a wrong. All he needs to do is escape from the mental institution where he is doing time for crimes he has committed. And who better to help him escape than a sweet nurse named Daphne, who claims to not only love him, but be a victim of domestic violence.

What would happen if she discovered, while playing up there one day, a mysterious stranger? Is he really Peter Pan or a crazed killer known as the "Mangler"?Now, I have several favorites but will just highlight my favorite three, and briefly explain why. Believe it or not, it was the first, one in the middle and the last. These three stand out in my mind as three of the most provocative short stories that I have read recently.Eric Jerome Dickey's portrayal of Harlem was brutally honesty and powerful. I found it to be both simply written and un-expectantly wonderful. What made LA Banks' Natural Instinct brilliant was that it was from the perspective of a man, who thinks he "can't be tame", and his undoing is classic. And finally, Dues' upstairs, for while I would have expected her to deliver a dreaded ending, she gave us just the opposite! A child's innocence soon disappears but for reasons she doesn't understand. In conclusion, these three alone are the reason that I give this book a 5.

Being snowed in allowed me to catch up on some movies that I have wanted to see. I guess you would ask why a person in their 40s wanted to see Step Up 3. I will tell you why....it was pure fun. There was a decent story line, but the dance scenes (especially the guy who rocked the robot) to die for. Ok, now the plot of the film. An aspiring film maker (and dancer) is trying to save his home, which also happens to be the homes for several homeless dancers. Winning a competition will pay the bills and save the warehouse from foreclosure. He has a strong sense of obligation to the kids who live there and finds himself slightly distracted by a beautiful dancer who isn't what she seems. The other main character is a college student who is temporarily ignoring his best friend because of his overwhelming need to dance. The two (the film maker and the college student/dancer) have bonded based a solid friendship out of their love for the arts.Why them do I give this campy yet charming movie a 5? It was pure fun. It's my opinion that the guy who did the robot scenes stole the show and the water (dance) sequence rocked. I also enjoyed the behind the scene stuff and extra videos. The story was easy to follow, and while not to original enjoyable, and the music was great and offered a wonderful escape from reality. I really enjoyed this movie, simply for what it was, a light-hearted drama about hope and ambition. I gladly give it a 5.

Reena (Catatina Hale) has spent her life interested, studying and intrigued by fire. As a child she saw her family's restaurant burn to the ground, by the Pastorelli's, and the consequences of this incident had far reaching effects on her life and those around her. Although the novel spans several decades, you see how her love of fire, and desire to understand it dominates her life, and unfortunately it takes the life of those that are near and dear to her heart. Then there's Bo Goodnight, a man who saw Reena in college, manages to have friends in common, runs in the same circles, and yet she seems to elude him. He has been in love with her since the moment he saw her, and they have never met.As Reena grows up and becomes an Arson Investigator, Bo becomes a carpender and searches for the elusive girl that he saw across the room at a party. As fate would have it, eventually, they meet, move next door to each other and find love. Unfortunately, someone wants to make Reena's life a living hell and destroy her with the very thing that she works so hard to understand, fire.The only criticism that I had was that the story at times took too long to tell. A story that was pretty simple and easy to understand (i.e., revenge, romance and intrigue), took decades to tell, but then the ending seemed rushed (I don't want to give any spoilers away, so I won't tell what happens). What took decades to build, meaning the story of who set the fire and why are her lovers being killed?, ended in a rushed flurry of death and anger, coupled with declarations of love by the main characters. At times, I wished some of the middle was removed (although I loved hearing about her large, wonderful, Italian family and their problems and mates), and that there had been more of the storyline and drama at the end.Overall, "Blue Smoke" was a story filled with chance encounters, missed opportunities and fate, and was a very entertaining read. I have become a lover of Roberts, especially her "In Death" series (JD Robb) and didn't mind taking the departure into her trip on the dark side.

Tough guy, Ryder (played by John Travolta), has taken a New York City subway train and its passenger's hostage, and will only release them once the mayor has paid $10 million dollars. Meanwhile, transit worker Walter Garber (who is under suspicion of taking a bribe) is the unfortunate dispatcher who Ryder makes contact with, and soon finds himself embarking on a series of tasks to rescue the hostages. There were two really great actors (Travolta & Washington), some snippers, some chase scenes, some really bad guys, an entertaining Mayor, and tons of stuff that should have made this a must see, but I was disappointed. There was so much potential, so many possibilities, but nothing really seemed to connect. There was no follow-thru, and nothing to really justify the mediocre ending of Garber (Washington) walking home with a half-gallon of milk following his showdown with Ryder (Travolta). Not even Travolta's attempt at being a bad guy and using "MF" constantly (although the tattoo on his neck was cute) seem genuine, just forced. What worked for him in Pulp Fiction (tough guy yet likeable) didn't really work here, and while I would love to give this a great review, I can't. But I will give this tale a "2" because I thought the outtakes and extras on the DVD were great.

I have become a huge Brockmann fan and love the series. And any opportunity to revisit Max Bhagat and Gina Vitagliano is worth it. In this installment of the Troubleshooter series, Max is devastated when he learns that Gina was killed in a terrorist bombing in Germany. Filled with regrets about what could have been and torn because he never admitted to Gina how he felt, Max, along with Jules Cassidy embarks on a journey to bring Gina's body home. The last time Max saw Gina, pushing her away (because he felt that the age difference was too much to overcome) she was headed to Kenya, to work with AIDS victims. Torn between duty and happiness, he did what he thought was best by letting Gina go, although he did not want to. After realizing that it is not Gina who was killed in the bombing, Max sets out to determine just "what has happened" to the love of his life? Gina, along with her good friend, Molly are in serious danger over their connection with Molly's old lover, David Jones. As the plot twists and turns, you are taking into a world of terrorism, politics and much more. I enjoyed this novel, and can't wait to read the next. It is already on my nightstand.

I don't know what I expected in a movie about one of our most beloved Presidents who happens to be a vampire hunter, but this was a pleasant surprise. It was a history lesson with a twist. Watching "Abraham Hunter: Vampire Hunter" was like seeing "The Matrix" and "Pulp Fiction" for the first time......a fascinating movie that was totally unexpected but greatly appreciated. I loved the way the writers wove bits of history (i.e., slavery, the death of his son, and the Civil War) with a possible premise that included slavery being beneficial for not only Southerners, but for vampires, seeing that they were using them for food. The movie literally shows the evolution of Abraham Lincoln from a young boy bent on revenge (vampires killed his mother) to a young man with political aspirations, into a man fighting to end slavery for several reasons, but none more important than preventing vampires for taking over the world. (Apparently slavery allows the vamps to feed without regard for the consequences). Regardless, as Lincoln's political career culminates in a presidency, we see Lincoln facing everything from the death of his son (again history with a twist) to betrayal by a friend. I definitely recommend this movie for those who love action, decent acting, great special effects and a movie soaked in history. After all, what could be better than an "ax" wielding President?

I picked "Hot Target" because I have read several Brockmann novels but somehow missed this one, and therefore, I had a gap in my understanding of some of the plot twists and turns. Because I knew the characters involved, and some of the eventual outcomes of their stories, I was excited to read a book that would possibly explain how certain characters got together or why certain characters did certain thinks in later novels. So, for me, I enjoyed this novel because (1) I have a better understanding of the Adam, Jules and Robin dynamic; (2) I know now how Angelina, Murphy's first wife died; (3) I understand how Cosmo and Jane got together; (4) I understand a little more about Tom and Kelley; (5) I was able to view the Decker and Sophia plot, and various other plot twists in the Troubleshooter Series. And although you may still not understand all the twists and turns, you will have more background into the characters. And for me, I now understood some of the intricate details in the story that before I didn't quite understand.J. (Jane) Mercedes Chadwick has written and produced an movie about a soldiers gay relationship during the war, and who better to star in her movie than her troubled, alcoholic brother Robin. Unfortunately, someone is threatening to kill Jane because of the relationship between the characters, and Troubleshooter's Inc. has been asked to protect her. Cosmo, Navy Seal extraordinaire (who is on leave) has been asked to be on the team assigned to protect Jane. On the surface, Jane appears to be everything that Cosmo doesn't like..... spoiled and very HOLLYWOOD, but underneath it all, she is far different. Meanwhile, Robin (an up and coming actor) is literally having the time of his life, sleeping with several women, drinking heavily and doing research into his character (a gay soldier who hid his true nature because he felt that he would not be accepted). Dealing with similar issues, Robin realizes that he may also be living a lie and fights his growing attraction to Jules Cassidy (an openly gay FBI agent).Of course there were some goofy moments in the story (for example, Cosmos whole "I don't want to hurt you" dialog just because she had a scratch on her arm), but overall I enjoyed this novel. There was a little suspense, some romance and an easy read. The strength of the novel was Jane's desire to accept Robin for who he is. Her unfailing determination to support him no matter what, and her acceptance of his decisions no matter what they were. I liked seeing Jules so wounded and yet so hopeful, afraid to accept less than he deserved. I also liked the fact that Brockmann does show the Robin's internal struggle between wanting acceptance and being true to himself. My only criticism is concerning Patty. I thought that her character was shallow and that Brockmann could have done a little more to make her more likeable. But overall, I thought that it was a decent read, as I am sure that you will too!

Maybe I just LOVE the grittiness and despair in this movie. I think it was in the same genre of Tarantino....or Pulp Fiction, Sin City, or Kill Bill. And like those movies, you are either going to love it or hate it. I for one, loved this movie! The story is simple, Buddy Isreal is a magician/mob informant who has finally outlived his usefulness. Whether the result of his growing drug addiction, addiction to the "fast life", or his "big" mouth, the mob boss wants him dead, and has placed a price on his head of $1 million dollars. Now comes the introduction of several bounty hunters who want Buddy and want him bad. The bounty hunters in themselves are entertaining, and make up a lot of the movie. They include: an ex-police officer (Ben Affleck)and two of his closest friends; the sexy Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) and her partner (who appears to be in love with her); and a freakish group of brothers (who are clearly unstable). But while the bounty hunters fight each other to locate the target (Isreal), a "chameleon" killer (we think)is hot on Isreal's trail. The question becomes who will reach him first?Meanwhile, the FBI, headed by Andy Garcia wants the information that Buddy has to offer about the Mob organization that they have been trying to bring down for years, and a secret that they are trying to protect. Assigned to locating and bring Isreal in are Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds, who are absolutely fabulous is their roles.Surrounded by a "hip hop" gangsta and a Russian "track suit wearing" bodyguard, Buddy tries to "play" his cards close to the chest, stay alive and keep partying while he is doing it. Finding that Buddy has made their lives expendable as well, we wonder who will stand up and protect Buddy in the end, because it seems that the odds are high that someone will "Smoke Isreal", but who will it be?What I found to be the most compelling about the story was the underlying struggle of the young agent to understand the difference between what is "right from wrong" AND "good and evil". Sometimes things aren't what they seem, and the decisions that are made aren't as easy as we would think.The only question I have is why is this movie marketed like Ben Affleck has a large role in the movie? I do think that Affleck showed that he is a talented actor (I don't think I have enjoyed any of his recent movies with exception of this one), but he definately did not "carry" the movie. There were a ton of exceptionally, talented actors. I was extremely pleased and surprised by the performance of hip hop singer "Common". Although I have never been a lover of his music, I thought that he added another dimension to the role that he played. I thought that he and Alicia Keys were both absolutely brilliant! So maybe I just like these kind of movies, and think that some of the other reviewers were kind of hard, but I definately think that Smokin' Aces deserves or warrants a 5.

I will first say that when I started watching this movie it was really late at night, and I fell asleep with only about 30 minutes to go. But the next morning, I woke up and watched it again and realized that I must have just been tired because it was a decent movie. I like the old look of the film, and I liked the fact that the movie did not depend on a lot of special effects but instead counted on vivid imagery to tell a decent story.Llewelyn, an VietnamVet, happens upon a bloody "drug deal gone bad", where everyone is dead (with the exception of a man who is on the verge) and $2 million dollars is just sitting there (in a suitcase) for the taking. What does Llewelyn do? He ignores a dying man (who is begging for water), takes the money and goes home to count his good fortune (why he didn't think the real owners of the money would come looking, I will never know). What does he do next? He feels guilty and goes back to the scene to give water to the dying man (which isn't so smart because if he does live, wouldn't he want the money back?). He was waging the internal war between his greed and his guilty conscious. Now initially, I thought that this was the cause of the chain of events that follow, but I soon realized is that the money would have been located by the Killer regardless. It had GPS! That's right boys and girls, the crazy killer (Chigurh, who has a thing for making you choose your fate...he asks you to pick heads or tails) would have found him anyway because he was following the money.Sending his sweet wife to her mother (who is crazy and tells everyone who will listen that she is dying), Llewelyn attempts to outsmart and outrun the killer (and I do mean killer, he kills any and everything with a cool gun) and keep the money. After several deaths, and a lot of maneuvering Llewelyn comes face to face with the killer and several other interesting characters, while a very determined local sheriff attempts to uncover the truth and find him before it is too late.Now don't get me wrong, I do have a few criticisms (although I still gave it 4 stars). #1. I felt a little cheated at the ending. After almost 200 minutes of story, I had an ending that really would have been better if some things had happened differently, but I won't tell you how it ends. I could have just thought of different endings for Llewelyn, Wells, the wife, the cop, and the crazed killer. And therefore, I found the ending to be a little anticlimactic. And. #2. Maybe I am stupid, but I am still confused about who had the money in the end? And if it is who I think it was, well that is even more disappointing.Now I will say what I did like....I liked each and every character (the good, the bad and the ugly). I loved the conversations that Tommy Lee Jones had with the guy in the wheelchair who put his entire life into perspective, and I thought the mother (Llewelyn's wife's mother) was hilarious. I also thought that the imagery (dry scenes, Texas) and the language (Southern drawls) were extremely appropriate.Anyway, with all that said, I really thought that the movie had more positives than negatives. And I believe that the average movie watcher, if they aren't expecting a lot of special effects, but want instead to see a crazy killer (with a bob), who mutters few words, and appears to be smarter than the average person, will enjoy this movie.

Quentin Hayes, a member of the secretive and highly controversial FBI Special Crimes Unit (SCU) has a mystery to solve (one that has haunted him for years). Still reeling from the death of his childhood friend (Missy), who was murdered while visiting the Lodge (a place that seems to attract psychic forces and has an evil presence) Quentin has tried for years to discover who was responsible for her death and the disappearance of several children in the past. Diana Brisco, drugged and treated as a mental patient for several years, is finally trying alternative methods of treatment (an art class at the Lodge) and feels herself drawn to Quentin, but is reluctant to accept that her problem may be the result of "psychic ability" and not "mental illness". As they work together to solve the mystery of "who or what is alive and well in the lodge", they find themselves battling a force of evil that wishes to destroy them.If you are a Kay Hooper fan, you will enjoy this paranormal mystery. I wouldn't say it was the best, but I did enjoy the growing relationship between Diana and Quentin and hope to see them in future novels.

As soon as my son is old enough to read and understand this novel, I am going to challenge him to read it one summer. I feel that every young person, especially young black males should read this novel. It accurately reflects how we are all products of our environment, and even sometimes caught up in situations beyond our control, but it is our response to these circumstances that is key. But the largest lesson to be learned and to understand is that there are always consequences to our actions, whether our actions are intentional or not.The novel brings up the interesting dichotomy that exists between nature and nurture. I eventually came to the conclusion that faced with some of the same challenges that Bigger Thomas had to deal with (racism, stereotypes, and himself...perhaps his own worse enemy), I could have made some of the same decisions. Even more troubling at the end of the novel is my conclusion that any of us could have been 'Bigger' because at the end of the novel, Bigger wasn't even the issue, it was Society and their response to Bigger.

I must first explain that this is my first Evanovich novel, so I had no expectations! I did like the fact that the book was a quick and easy read, and I didn't really have to think. The story was interesting and evolved into more than I initially anticipated. And there were frankly parts of the story where I laughed out loud (hint: dinner scene and conversation between future brother-in-law and grandmother).Stepahnie Plum is a sassy bounty hunter who is trying desperately to locate Samuel Singh, a computer nerd who has skipped bail for her Boss, who fears that he will lose everything if he doesn't get him back. Following several clues and having many misadventures, a seemingly simple case has evolved into one that involved serial killings and a game, where Stephanie may be the ultimate prize. There are a host of very interesting characters, from Stephanie's pregnant sister Valarie (who refuses to marry the father of her baby); her elderly grandmother (who is overly concerned with her hair); her present boyfriend (Joe Morelli, who is a cop and who swears she will be the death of him); her partners, Ranger (ex-special forces/scary guy/hot ex-lover), and Lula (overweight ex-prostitute whose ultimate goal is to have the body of a supermodel by eating only meat); Vinnie (her cousin and Boss); and a very unstable killer.Overall, I enjoyed this novel and probably would read another installment so that I could find out what ever becomes of the love triangle between Plum, Morelli and Ranger.

I remember thinking, when this movie came out.....Not too sure if I want to go and pay $8 at the movie theater, but I will see it when it comes out on DVD (rent not purchase). I added that to my ever growing list of "movies to rent" and forgot about it. So imagine my delight when I saw that it was on by Demand (what I think is the best invention in years...no lines, no waiting to see the movie, just sit at home and order it). Now I already knew that the Rush Hour movies are similar to the Matrix movies in that, you can't wait for the next one to come out, but deep down you know that it couldn't possibly be as good as the first. I see Chris Tucker around Atlanta on occassion, and even remember seeing him do standup locally before he was in Friday....he is usually very funny. But in Rush Hour 3, with a few pounds (and I know we all have gained them) he just wasn't as funny as he usually is. And the usual farter that happens between he and Jackie Chan didn't appear as effortless as in the previous installments of the Rush Hour series. And it is obvious that Jackie has aged as well because we were not privy to as many fighting scenes as he normally gives us.Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan)and LAPD Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) have made a promise to the daughter of the Ambassador (again) that they will discover who shot her father while he was attempting to uncover the identity of the leader of an elusive secret organization. Pursuiting leads to Paris, we see the merry, yet reluctant pair bantering about their friendship and trying to understand who is behind everything. Tucker meets a beautiful woman, and Chan discovers something about a family member that he just doesn't want to accept while having several dangerous encounters with a knife carrying woman.I gave this movie a 2 for the following reasons: (1) there were so many references to past Rush Hour movies, that if you have never seen the previous movies, you would have no idea who and what they were talking about. Even the main storyline....the one involving the ambassador referred back to the 1st movie. So when Tucker kept referring to the little girl and then a young adult hugged him, most people would probably not know what was going on. The references to Chan's Secret Service Agent girlfriend, and other mishaps were from other movies. Perhaps it would have been better had they created a movie that could have stood alone. (2) I have grown tired of Chris Tucker acting silly during times when he shouldn't. I would have preferred Tucker to really dig his teeth in the roll and really come up with something original, especially since it seems that he will only do Chan movies (these have been the only movies he has done in the last few years). What I do like about all of these Rush Hour Moviews are the outtakes at the end. They are always as funny, if not funnier than the movie.

Have you ever watched a movie and thought...I missed something or simply don't get it. This movie had everything that should have made it enjoyable, but failed terribly. From the ads, I expected a lot more....even the special effects did not live up to what I expected. I am a science fiction lover, having people with powers fighting some bad guys usually is a recipe for success....ok, I even found some things to like about Watchmen although that was disappointing too. Anyway, there is an agency, known as the Division, that wants to control the people who have special abilities and harness there powers for their use. There are "movers" (who can move objects with their minds); "watchers" (clairvoyants); "pushers" (who influence people) and "sniffers" (who can track people by touching objects that those they track have touched). Nick Gant, a mover, has been on the run from the Division since his father, after saying something cryptic about helping a girl, was killed several years prior. Now, Cassie (a young watcher) is contacting him about helping a pusher, Kira, who has escaped from the Division and the clutches of the bad guy "Agent Henry Carver". Don't get me wrong, there were a few great special effects, but not enough to overcome the weird half finished plots. I don't know when it spun out of control, but I remember feeling cheated and oddly unsettled. I really ended up thinking, why did I rent this. Honestly, it wasn't even good enough for a Sunday evening rental, and definitely isn't worth purchasing or seeing at the dollar theater. There was tons of potential, just no execution.

I know there are those who won't agree, but I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I have some of the other Perry movies. First, "Madea goes to Jail" was typical Tyler Perry, there was nothing new or exciting. The cookie cutter formula of "man does woman wrong, woman struggles, Madea acts a fool but has a good heart, and everything works out after a great deal of struggle, with a lot of laughs and some serious moments" is still the recipe of this Perry movie. However, there were also some lose ends that seemed to hang out there left unanswered.Madea is once again facing jail time for actions that she takes when a woman steals her parking space. Willing to do things that the average person is afraid to do, she takes things into her own hands and issues her own brand of justice. Facing a less lenient Judge (Judge Mathis), Madea is sentenced to some prison time. Meanwhile, an over zealous prosecutor, fueled by jealousy, insures a stiff sentence for her fianc&eacute;e's friend, Candace (played by Cosby show's Keshia Knight Pulliam) by committing prosecutorial misconduct. Surrounded by several interesting characters, both Madea and Candace (rape victim turned prostitute) do what they have to do in order to survive prison.Although there were some funny situations and lines in this latest Perry production (the Uncle is still a hoot), I don't think it offered anything new or original. Perry's formula of victimization, laughs and someone done someone wrong worked to a point, but would have been better if some of the storylines had been followed through. I thought Madea would pass along some of her wisdom or influence Candace more than she did. Instead, Candace and Madea seem to just be in the same institution with no real interaction. In other Perry movies, Madea was instrumental in helping the main character recognize her victimization as well as provide support for her to do something about it. In this movie, Madea was just in the prison and providing some comic relief but in my opinion not really influencing Candace. Then again, maybe I have come to expect a lot in Perry movies and was just disappointed. Was it the worse movie to watch on a Sunday evening, no...would I have paid to see it in the theater, no.

I must admit that I was reluctant to read this BRILLANT novel because I thought that it would not offer anything new and different. I was wrong. It was well written and an author, that I had been reluctant to give a chance, won me over. Although filled with dark topics and vivid glimpses into a world unlike one that I live, I buckled up and enjoyed the ride!I will not rehash the plot of the Bridge, because several have done it before me, but I will tell you that the story (in my opinion) wasn't really about the missing girl, but those who were left in her absence. It reminded me of a movie that I saw recently with Casey Afleck and Morgan Freeman, Gone Baby Gone, and what happens to a child living in horrible conditions, and how that one life, or the one attempting to save the life could make a difference in the life of others.Kevin Lynch, Detective and his partner, Wilson are in search of a 9 year old girl who is missing. A voice from his past, and lost love, Daneen (a recovering addict and imperfect person) has come to Lynch wanting help finding her daughter, Kenya. Kenya was last seen leaving her aunt's (a loser crack dealer)apartment never to be seen again. The mystery is, where is Kenya and who took her. While investigating this tough case, with a very predictable ending, you navigate Lynch's youth and life, to see what made him, and those around him what they are. What was so telling and interesting about the novel was how Lynch escaped "The Bridge" a housing development to become successful, while his friends became what his grandmother feared their surroundings would make him. While you see some characters attempting to rise above their circumstances (Lily), you see those living the "life", scraping by and just making it (Daneen, Judy, Sonny, Darnell and several others). Although by the end I had figured out the mystery, or at least part of it, I still enjoyed the ride. This novel was extremely visceral in its depictions of despair, desire, retribution and revelations. There were things that I would have changed about the novel, like the end (I still don't understand why), but perhaps that's what makes this novel so good. That there really wasn't a good reason why, things just were. And perhaps, the greatest lesson learned is that "the truth always comes out", no matter what you do to forget (drugs, sex, or simply lying to yourself) it will come out. I strongly suggest that you read "The Bridge", you will enjoy it...or course it isn't perfect, and I don't want to spend a lot of time on that, but the pros outweigh the cons.

I have to admit this is my first W.E.B. Griffin thriller, although I have had several people suggest that I would like his writing style. So when loaned this book, I gave it a chance and found that I am torn about how I really feel about it. I guess although I am not new to thrillers, this kind of political thriller was a first. I am not sure if it was the length of the book, several references to things that I really didn't care about or the lengthy explanations about things that I didn't really think were important that made me keep putting this book down. Eventually I did finish it, but......I am not sure if I would read another Griffin novel.Major Charlie Castillo, sharpshooter turned political mover-and-shaker/go to man, who has the ears of not only the Secretary of State and Homeland Security, but the President of the United States (who also has unwavering faith in Charlie's abilities to solve difficult challenges, like stealing a plane back from the enemy), has been given the duty (by the President no less) to go to Buenos Aires, discover how a diplomat's wife was kidnapped, and later how that same diplomat (Jack "the Stack" Masterson) was murdered. [This is one of the problems that I had with the story, while Griffin was attempting to give some other explanation about the possible kidnapping, I thought that it was kind of silly how they kept mentioning how Masterson was a promising basketball star when he was hit by a beer truck, suing and given several million dollars as a settlement. Therefore, providing a potential motive for the crimes, but it was said so many times, you knew that it couldn't be the real motive for the crime, merely a diversion.] While interviewing people concerning the incident, there are a series of misadventures (like a promising young officer getting killed and Castillo's love interest being shot) that eventually led to the real motive for the crimes. In the meantime, there are continuous references made to Castillo's background and wealth that I didn't think really added to the story, but added fluff to an already lengthy tale. And it definitely would have been better had Griffin not introduced a love interest who ended up being injured and disappeared for most of the novel, with only vague references made to her condition while he "solved" the mystery of "what is going on in Buenos Aires"?Anyway, as the plot unfolds, you soon discover that the series of events are the direct result of the "Oil for Food" scandal, the Iraq conflict, corruption, terrorism, gas and oil (all issues that our government is dealing with today). The entire thing end ups boiling down to the age old theme of greed, and a desire for wealth and privilege.What then merits a "3"? Well, I will break it down into positives and negatives. Positives about the book: It was interesting to learn some of the political stuff that goes on behind the scenes. The interactions between the different governmental agencies (Secret Service, CIA, FBI, Homeland Security) and their attempts to work with and against each other seems to be a realistic view of how things in politics and government works. Negatives about the book: I thought it was a little too long and some of the focus should not have been on Masterson's failed basketball attempt, Castillo's attempt at romance seemed a little forced. He was declaring his undying and unwavering love for Betty Snyder (the agent who was injured during an assassination attempt) after one night of passion (although maybe this romance was explained in the first book that I never read). I also thought the continuous discussions about his "great wealth" (living and staying at expensive hotels, etc.) was irrelevant. And some of the build up to Castillo's epiphany concerning who and what was really responsible for the death of Masterson also seemed a little forced (i.e., visiting his uncle, talking to people who acted like they didn't trust him, but spilled their guts easily concerning what they knew) and the truth was not the result of good investigative work, but deductive reasoning and listening. I also feel that the beginning of the book seemed totally different from the middle and the end. While the first portion appeared to be setting the stage for the kidnapping of Masterson's wife, the next thing you know, she is acting squirrelly and not telling the truth about the death of her husband, and although the rest of the novel was about that, it moved in another direction. And while I don't mind an author meandering around the plot, keeping it stupid simple is always best. Either way, although I am not sure if I would read another Griffin novel, I will give this one a "3". It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. It just could have been streamlined!

Overall, I enjoyed this novel. I had some trouble with the language at times, but the story itself was good. There were characters that you love, ones that you will hate, and some that are lost. Sid was the character that I found the most endearing, and I was deeply saddened by his circumstances in the end. But you must live with the consequences of your actions, and I think that is the whole theme throughout "Fed up with the Fanny". I would suggest that you read this novel and give it a chance. For a first novel by this author, it is a great beginning.

Renown authors/poets James Lowell, JT Fields, Oliver W. Holmes and Henry W. Longfellow are members of a literary organization known as "The Dante' Club". Dedicated to deciphering and translating Dante's works from Italian to English. These literary giants fight Harvard and others to reveal these works to a very resistant world.While the 1800's saw Boston thriving and changing, it also saw an outbreak of distemper (that killed several horses thus successfully stalling transportation), the hiring of the first "mulatto" Boston police officer (which met resistance on and off the department), and a series of brutal murders that mimic those punishments issued in Dante's works. While they follow the clues, and try to protect their work and reputations, they find that everything is not as it appears, and everyone is a potential suspect.Although I usually would not select a "period piece", when given this book to read, I gave it a chance. I thought that it was at least worth a 3.

I have to admit that this was one of the darkest and most depressing novels that I have ever, in my entire life (well maybe "The Warmest December" and "Sybil" were as dark, just better written with better story lines)...anyway, this novel was so depressing...I think I said that already..that it was difficult to read and often you were so turned off by the writing style, the subject matter, the characters (obese mother, triffling/raping father, rape, incest, AIDS, Social Service Agencies, Broken foster/Social care system, etc) that you did not want to finish it. The only interesting thing that I found about the novel was that it was written in the voice of the victim, an uneducated teen (kind of reminded me of the Color Purple, although that was a better story). And as things progressed in her life, the writing did improve. The most redeeming thing about the novel is that you can see how people by nature, especially children are SURVIVORS and are shaped by their circumstances. One would learn that you can either deal and live, or simply give up and die. So no matter what I thought of the novel, Precious (symbolism in her name) was a survivor and made the best of her circumstances. And has not certain people felt to the need to get involved, she may very well have not made it.

I usually don't start out my reviews saying what I don't like, but I will this time just to get it out of the way. I felt at times that there was a little too much going on to follow the main plot of the story. And secondly, I wish that the love triangle (possible quad-rangle LOL) between Deck (the brutish hunk), Sofia (the abused concubine turned agent), Dan (the newly enchanted hunk) and Dave (the best friend who wants to be more, but is too afraid to ask) would have come to some sort of head, so that I could look forward to it's resolution in future books. With that said, I will say what I did like about the book.I have recently started reading Suzanne Brockmann and never find myself bored with either her plots or her characters. Her novels are filled with intrigue, romance and characters that overlap in all of her stories. "Into the Storm" was a wonderful addition in the Troubleshooters series. Lindsey (sexy Asian American) finds herself attracted to vertically challenged/Ryan Seacrest look-alike, Mark Jenkins, who of course thinks he is in love with his high school crush, Tracy. Tracy, of course is running from a bad relationship and hoping that her leaving will cause her wayward ex (Lyle) to come looking for her with a big engagement ring. Failing at her new job, and wanting what she thinks is best, she is picked as a hostage for the a special assignment with her new co-workers. Well of course the story isn't that simple. Following a night of intense romance, Mark realizes that perhaps Tracy isn't who he wants, but Lindsey is....the problem is, he can't convince her (she has a little baggage) that a relationship with him would be best. Izzy, Mark's bestfriend, decides that although he shouldn't be attracted to Tracy, he is and maybe one harmless night of fun, will be ok. Tracy, feeling once again betrayed by her ex, looks for revenge sex as a means of paying him back. But soon discovers that she likes Izzy probably more than she should.Needless to say, a series of events leads to Tracy's disappearance and a serial killer's unmasking. So between the serial killer, the romances, the action and potential future stories, I enjoyed this book and suggest that you read it as well. While multiple storylines can make the story slightly overwhelming, there is enough future potential to keep me reading future installments in this series.

I kind of knew where this latest Britt Montero novel was going, but I had to read it to see if I was right. And because I knew what would happen and was so disappointed that for once my vision of Britt's future was not what I wanted it to be, I give this book a 4-4.5 instead of a 5.This novel is filled with forboding about something deadful to come that will impact everyone in lives of Britt Montero . The overlying story itself revolves the death of a guy who may have been responsible or involved in an old rape/murder. Fourteen years ago, two young kids were abducted and left for dead. Of the two victims, one did not survive (Ricky), but Sonny, the girl did. She was raped and left for dead. As Britt begins her latest news article about the newly formed Cold Case Squad, she is plagued with issues concerning the reopening of the old murder case (reluctance of witnesses, intimidation, and several shady suspects). Sonny, the survivor, is now a reclusive artist who seems to not only be deaf in one ear, but has emotional scars, and does not seem to remember who raped her and left her for dead. As the story plays out, you see Britt's desire to find justice, while maintaining her relationships with co-workers, friends, and old/new lovers. Sometimes Buchanan's efforts to parallel the devastation occuring in New York with the lives of her characters, was hard to enjoy/. However, in the end, although there were things that I would change, I still enjoyed reading the book.

Well, you have the very sexy Jason Statham tried and wrongfully convicted for the murder of his wife. Of course he isn't guilty, but why someone killed his wife soon becomes apparent when he is asked to race, in prison, as the recently deceased driver (AKA Frankenstein). The Death Races, created, produced and organized by the warden are immensely popular to internet fans, and the person to win the most gains his freedom (ok, a tad unrealistic, but this is a movie). Anyway, although the plot is rather thin, there are several things to LOVE about this film. There is the incredibly sexy Statham (ok, I know that I have said that several times), a crooked warden and her evil sidekick, a very pretty/sexy woman who rides shotgun with Statham, a funny mechanic, Tyrese (anyone riding with him manages to die), fast cars, explosions, and the general dose of death and destruction. So, would I give this movie an Oscar? No. But would I recommend it for someone looking for a few hours of mindless entertainment? Yes, absolutely.

Several of my friends assure me that because I enjoy the paranormal genre, I should watch True Blood. Unfortunately I don't have HBO, so I purchased the series with the explicit understanding that it would be worth it. Guess what girls and boys it was....it rocked. What was most surprising is that I have read a couple Charlaine Harris novels and did not recognize that it was the same storyline (I must re-read when I get a chance). Anyway, in a nutshell the entire first season is a murder mystery revolving around the deaths of several women who are "fang bangers" or willing to have sex with vampires. Let me start over, perhaps I jumped too quickly into the plot and you are lost. I should explain a few things first. The vampires live openly with the rest of society due to a recently manufactured product known as "True Blood". This product is synthetic blood which the vamps can drink versus human blood. Of course there are opposing sides, the religious fanatics, the vamps and the rest of the world who are either curious about the entire "vamp lifestyle" or scared to death of what living with vampires could mean. Meanwhile, there is a rash of murders in a small Louisiana town that hint to either a vampire killer or a someone who wants to make it look like a vampire.Sookie Stackhouse is the main character and is a waitress at Merlotte's Diner. She also has a secret, she can hear people's thoughts. One night she overhears a couple plotting to harvest a vampire's blood to get "high". Apparently vampire blood enhances sexual experiences and fetches a pretty penny on the drug scene. Saving the vampire's life, Sookie begins a relationship with Bill, a hundred something year old vamp. Meanwhile, Sookie's brother, Jason (a simpleton and womanizer) appears to be the prime suspect in the recent murders in town. It seems that every woman he has sex with is turning up dead. Hot on the killer's trail is Officer Andy Bellefleur, who will stop at nothing to get the truth. There are several other characters to love in this series: Tara (her best friend); Sam (Merlotte's owner who has a secret...and it's not just that he has a crush on Sookie although he does); Nelson (a cross dressing/gay cook who sells vamp blood on the side); a gang of cool vamps; some religious fanatics; and a town full of interesting characters. As the plot unfolds, so does the genius writing of the show. What makes this series so wonderful is the build up to future storylines and an expectation of things to come. I definitely feel that I got a deal when I purchased the series. I definitely would recommend it, especially if you like shows like Nip Tuck, Sunny in Philadelphia, HBO's old series OZ or 6th Feet Under, Rescue Me......although True Blood does have more nudity. I think what makes all these series a hit is that they are edgy and offer something new to viewers. However, the challenge will be can the writers maintain the integrity of the show. I hope so and look forward to purchasing Season 2.

This was my first Patricia Briggs novel, and while I enjoyed it, I am not sure if I would recommend reading this one first. I don't know about the evolution of Briggs as a writer or her various plots and storylines, but it did take me a few discs to appreciate the wordiness (although Briggs did warn me in her introduction) of "Masques" or the world of Aralorn. While I enjoy the supernatural/paranormal and fantasy genre, this was more of a dated piece that took place in the medieval period. I traditionally read the current stuff, so while this was easy to understand, some times the description of the scenery distracted from the story. Regardless, because I have often seen the Mercy Thompson series and had this author and her works on my lists of books to read (when I got around to it), I jumped on the opportunity to select Masques, especially since it was available on audiobook.Aralorn, is a spy who uses her powers of shape-shifting (usually to the form of a mouse) and green magic (her birth rite), to determine what foul deeds a powerful sorcerer (Geoffrey ae `Magi) is planning. Held captive and made privy to just how dangerous the `Magi is, she aligns herself with a wolf (who really isn't a wolf) and a very helpful horse to warn those who need to be warned of the impending danger. Jumping in and out of one perilous adventure after another, Aralorn fines treachery, adventure and romance (a little) abound in this decent story of sorcery, betrayal and magic.Briggs weaves a decent tale and tells us in the opening that this was one of her earlier works, tweaked for re-release. I am not sure if this should have been the first novel by Briggs that I should have read, because honestly I am not compelled to try another anytime soon, but it wasn't a terrible story, just not necessarily "my cup of tea". I would give the story a 3. Why then the 4 stars? Well....I really enjoy audiobooks and I thought that listening to the books really enhanced my enjoyment of the story. I also thought the narrator, Katherine Kellgren was great. She added just the right amount of humor and realism to the story. So a decent story, with an enjoyable narrator, resulted in an enjoyable experience.

Similar to the writing style of Gloria Naylor, Diane McKinney-Whetstone allows us into a world that appears normal on the surface, but underneath is full of dysfunction and secrets. There is Joe, with his love of the horn, who is so blind that he does not see what is in front of him...or living next door to him. There is Louise, his wife who keeps everything nice and neat, and yet neglects her own teeth, to the point that they all must be pulled. There is Alberta, who was marked by her mother at birth, and who hides behind religion, because she has suppressed what she really is....a lonely woman with needs. And then there are those who love and accept them, when they have not been able to love and accept themselves. This is one of the most moving accounts of understanding and realization that I have ever read. I enjoyed it immensely and suggest strongly that you enter the world of "Cecil Street", a street that looks so together, and yet struggles not to fall apart. In this world, love, forgiveness, understanding and letting go, all prove to heal those that need it.

The Change Up starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds wasn't exactly what I expected! Yes, there were a few moments where I simply laughed out loud, but others where I kind of shook my head. Childhood friends Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) have secretly envied each others' lives. Mitch is a free minded actor who goes thru his life with no responsibilities or consequences for his actions. Dave is a successful attorney with a wife and kids, who thinks the grass is greener on the other side, which in this case would be the life of his free spirited friend. Wishing for the others' life, Mitch and Dave chant their desires while urinating in a fountain in the park. Waking to find themselves in the others' body, they each set to have what they always desired. Through a series of misadventures.....and there are several...they learn to appreciate what they have. Dave learns that success and wealth won't bring you happiness if you don't take the time to appreciate those who love and care for you; while Mitch learns that ignoring his responsibilities; being promiscuous; and smoking pot gets a little old as you get older.Overall, the movie was ok and somewhat entertaining, and in the end, the theme was clear...."the grass is not always greener" or "appreciate, cherish and be grateful for what you have". And finally, while I thought I selected the theatrical version, there were some scenes that contained nudity and or sexual innuendo. The "F" word was also used liberally. So this movie isn't necessarily for kids and depending on your rules, it wouldn't necessarily be appropriate for your teens.

Contrary to what a lot of other people believe, I do not think that this novel was a good "sequel" to "My Soul to Keep". Granted, it was good, but it was a little too wrapped up for my taste. At the end of "My Soul to Keep" we are wondering: (1) Where is David and will he return?; (2) What will the child Jessica Jacobs Wolde be like since it is the one that will be born of the "living blood"?; (3) What will David do once he finds out about the child that Jessica has?;(4)What powers will the new child have? and (5)What will the secret society of Immortals do to Jessica and the child once they discover the child? So you can see, I was waiting for the sequel like so many other lovers of the first book. I was eagerly anticipating the release of this book and went the day it was released to the bookstore to own it. I hate to say it, but I was a LITTLE disappointed. The "Living Blood" finds Jessica saving people (literally) everyday with her "blood" (remember she was made immortal by her husband in "My Soul to Keep") in Botswana. The child that she was pregnant with when she experienced the "change", Fana, is growing and beginning to develop some unusual powers. She can control the weather (among other things) and minds. She is also haunted by a "Bee Lady" (see the cover of the book) who we are not sure for awhile if she is good or evil. We see a wealthy, angry man, determined to obtain the secret behind the "curing/living" blood to help save his son, who is dying from cancer, live. We see Jessica struggle to prevent David from finding out about their daughter and her efforts to cure the ills of humanity (remember her devoted, doctor sister will not use the blood to cure herself but will use it to cure others), while coping with what "immortality" really means. This is a story that has intrigue, suspense, and adventure while still maintaining the original storyline. My only criticism is that at the end, it appears to be wrapped up a little too neat. I would have rather come to my own conclusions about what the future holds for the group of survivers. But then again, maybe this is like the Matrix, after Part 1, you could not wait for Part 2, but when it was released, you just thought something was missing. But don't get me wrong, I definately recommend that you read this book, because missing it would be a mistake.

The last few chapters did not make up for the slow moving storyline in the beginning.Cate, a widow and mother to 4-year old twins, runs the B&B; in Trail Stop, a small town where no one ventures unless they mean to. The whole story revolves around a guy who leaves the B&B; with something that a "bad guy" wants back...his financial records. In an effort to retrieve his information, he hires several killers to track him down. They descend upon Trail Stop to get back the missing information. After Cate concludes that something is afoot, she sends her sons off to stay with her mother. Left finally, to her own devices, she realizes that the "handyman" that has saved her life could be her future love. Through a series of trials, they are forced together...at which time, he tells her how he has loved her for years, and she admits that she was not ready to love until now. It was a cute story, but the best parts were in the last few chapters. There are some portions of the story that could have been completed...like Goss' night with a woman who joked that she "could be a serial killer", only to in the last sentence of the book...refer to her again. Also, why have a whole novel revolve around these guys getting the item back, when the bad guys eventually kill each other. It was a little silly, but if you would like to read something quick and easy, and maybe at times entertaining, give it a try.

Fate.You control your fate.Destiny.You are the maker of your own destiny.No one determines your future but you.You must have faith and believe in who you are.And finally, to be whole you must embrace both sides of your nature.Simple principles, but key in this fantasy driven tale of courage and fate. I watched "Dragonball Evolution" with my sons (10 and 8) who love the cartoon. We were entertained and all enjoyed this easy to understand story of young love and destiny. There are fight scenes and lots of other action. Definitely family friendly and worth renting.

I am one of the few, it would seem, that enjoyed this book. First I must say that I normally do not Lolita Files' (with the exception of "Child of God" which I thought was brilliant!! A++). I grew tired of the sister girl themed books a long time ago. But this one (like Child of God)I could not believe that she had written. There was the usual stuff...sex and betrayal...but there was also subplots that I enjoyed immensely. I thought this book was very creative and an easy read, although there were a few things that I would have liked to change or see.If you need a brief narrative of what the novel is about....Meet Penn Hamilton(handsome and sexy - I think there was a reference to him supposedly resembling Brad Pitt in the book; and intelligent-apparently he has an IQ of 210) who should by all accounts be a success, but hasn't found the right person to promote his book. Enters Beryl, a narcoleptic, obsessive compulsive individual who dresses nicely, but apparently is nothing to look at. You guessed it, they secretly become a couple...she wants to live her fantasy in real life, and he wants his book published. Not only did she promote the book, but Apple/IPOD, Starbucks, and other large entities (including a rap artist) bidding for the newly discovered Penn, and they didn't even know what the book was about. You guessed it, there are a series of twists and turns in a book filled with secrets and surprises. There are several interesting characters and a lot of character building. Now, this is the problem that I had with the book, I thought that there was a lot of ground work in the beginning that wasn't necessary. All the good stuff was in the end...and some of that could have been explained more. I thought the relationship between Penn and his best friend Mercury should have been discussed more, especially at the end.One thing that I loved about the novel was that the character that you were suppose to hate (Penn), you didn't. His complexities and nuances became endearing qualities...or at least you definately didn't hate him, and in a way you understood him. His background is interesting (parents, musical prodigy..etc).But what I enjoyed the most at the end was the way Files left it to your imagination if Penn is up to his murderous ways once again, and if he is...who will protect him now.

Irish bothers Connor and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) get an epiphany after killing in self defense....God wants them to rid the world of evil. So, using guns and religion as weapons, they systematically wage a war on those in society who use and abuse those considered weak. Why not start with the mobsters who control the city and brutalize those who stand in their way. Realizing that there is more to these deaths that meet the eye, a somewhat unconventional FBI Agent Paul Smecker (William Defoe) arrives on the scene with headphones (he listens to opera) and a dedication to catching these vigilantes, although he secretly desires to join the duo. Running from some who want to kill them, while trying to rid the world of those deemed less desirable, Connor and Murphy meet their match in a gray haired killer released to catch them. As the story unravels, there are gun fights, comedic bantering, but most of all there is a sense that these two Irish brothers are doing the very things that people desire to do themselves. Handing out justice...being the judge, the jury and the executioner appeals to most, even an FBI Agent whose hands are tied usually by the law. So while their methods may appear to be brutal, we justify the actions and find some sense of hope that there are still those that stand for what is right. They are doing what we have all longed to do and one point or another. And although we could debate is doing the wrong thing for the right reasons justify their actions (i.e., breaking the law...murder is murder), it was great just seeing two people take a stand for something that they believe in and this is what made this storyline so endearing.This movie had everything that made it great......there is comedy, violence, creative twists, and great acting that only a truly brilliant and creative director could bring to life. My first thought was that this movie could have been directed by Tarentino (who I absolutely love) and I know that I will not be the last person to say that after seeing both of their works. In short, Duffy's "Boondock Saints" had the same atmosphere and edgy wit and humor that a Tarentino flick would have, only better!Anyway, I had never heard of this movie before, but picked it up on the chance that it would be somewhat entertaining. I was right and ended up renting Part 2. Definitely see it if you haven't had the chance already. It's brilliant!

How would I describe "Mad River Road". I guess it was just OK. It wasn't that I hated it, and it had potential, but sometimes there was just a lot of buildup and then nothing. It also didn't help that I listened to the audio version. Ok, I just changed my initial rating from a 3 to a 2.My biggest criticism of the book was that I hated the main character, Jaime. She was so stupid,needy, simple and dumb. And although she was pivotal in the novel, you eventually tired of her, much like the killer (Brad/Ralph Fisher). Opps, that was kind of mean. Anyway, why you listened to her go on and on (she found out her boyfriend was married, she divorced a mama's boy, she hates her job, etc) you begin to dislike her, and by the time she finally steps to the plate, you don't care. You knew if she falled short again, someone SMARTER would pick up the slack. Anyway, while she tramples through life, you listen to her pushy sister (who is an attorney)and her dead,domineering mother (who was a successful judge) in her head telling her that she needs to grow up! All of this is true, and when she finally grows up it seems too late because you have stopped caring about her and don't care.The story begins with Jaime finding that her boyfriend is having surgery, of course she visits in the hospital and finds that he has a wife. She doesn't understand how she "could not have known", when everyone that works with them did. She meets a man, in a bar, with a wonderful smile and takes him home, and quickly to bed. She thinks that he is the best lover that she has ever had. She believes that perhaps this one-night stand could evolve into something when she quits her job and returns home to find that her lover has fixed her a cup of coffee. (I told you she was simple.) Brad convinces her that they should be free spirits and hit the open road, to visit his wife and small son. She says (very Barbie like) sure. And in my mind, I was thinking "she doesn't even know this man" and "if it looks too good, it probably is". As the journey progresses, Jaime finds that Brad is a liar, killer and nothing that she first assumed. Why, because she didn't get to know him. There are times when she goes on and on about meaningless stuff (as they pass through cities, she picks up meaningless trivia to fill in the dead spaces of her thoughts), and they have sex in the oddest places. She finds this all exciting until her makes her revisit her exhusband's mother's home in Atlanta to retrieve some pearl and gold earrings that she believes truly belong to her. From there, things go downhill and she realizes that her vacation is really a trip to hell.Meanwhile, on Mad River Road, we are introduced to a single mother who is also a compulsive liar and thief (Emma) and her sweet, good-hearted, widowed, single-mother, neighbor Lilly. We learn that Emma can not help herself, she lies at the drop of a hat about the dumbest things.....for example, she is the eye on the Maybelline Package, and she steals dumb stuff too. For example, she steals a trophy from the gym where Lilly works, just to steal it. Dumb? Emma, on the other hand, is still reflecting on the death of her loving husband who was killed in a motorcycle accident, and trying to find love with a hot Detective who works out in the gym where she works. One of them is the wife of and mother to Brad/Ralph Fisher's son, and to me it was obvious and you will not be surprised.The story continues with rapes, murders, and countless other plot twists, but you still can't get away from how Jaime refuses to take a stand. I mean knowing that you will probably die anyway, why not take a chance. I don't know, I really liked some of the stuff in the book, but there was other stuff that I could not get over. I would say read all the reviews and make up your mind about reading or listening to Mad River Road.

This legal thriller centers around the brutal killing of a prominent, politically connected socialite (Paul Hanover) and his beautiful fiancee', Missy. Who killed the high-powered duo before setting their newly redecorated masion on fire and why? So, to get to the bottom of the mystery, San Francisco Mayor West asks Deputy Chief Abe Glitsky to look into the death of her friend and biggest supporter. She doesn't believe that her friend killed his lover and then turned the gun on himself, nor does she have confidence in the lead Detective, Dan Cuneo, who suffers from a bad attitude and some kind of compulsive disorder. While the investigation appears to be a "slam dunk" for the police and prosecutor (a suspect is quickly identified, the daughter-inlaw, Catherine Hanover, who appears to have the most powerful motive of all greed and desire for money), Glitsky's instincts suggest that there is more to this case than meets the eye. Unfortunately Glitsky has a lot on his plate. Although he is middle aged (approaching 50, with grown children), he has a young child and one of the way. He also feels guilt about something (that must have been explained in previous books, because it wasn't really explained here...only that it involved a shoot-out)and doesn't want to alienate Cuneo or others in the department. And on top of that, his old partner and holder of the same "secret", Dismis Hardy, is the ex-boyfriend and defense attorney of the prime suspect. And finally, when Abe's son is born, something is wrong (won't tell you exactly what, you will have to read for yourself), and that takes his focus off the investigation.While the story takes you through their personal lives, the investigation and the trial, you come to agree that sometimes doing your job (i.e., solving a case) is influenced by politics and frankly bad blood between various law enforcement agencies. I work in law enforcement and I know, but I am not saying that this book is 100% realistic, just accurate about that conflict. But most of all, Hardy finds that believing in what someone (Catherine) use to be or use to represent, could influence how you represent them, and may causes you to make mistakes and not see what is really there. Dismas has to face certain things about himself and his life before he can successfully defend a woman who he once loved.Anyway, I enjoyed the story immensely although there was a great deal going on....it started out as a simple murder investigation, and blossomed into a great deal more (i.e., espionage, terrorism, federal nominations for cabinet positions, Mob relations, identity theft, embezzlement, CIA, FBI, infidelity, etc). But I also liked the underlying theme of "life regrets" (I am not going to tell you all everything, again you have to read the book). For me, that was what is so potent about the story...."if you know what you know now, would you have taken the same road? And this is true for Missy, Glitsky,Cuneo and especially Hardy. And when the puzzle is solved, you find that like "real life investigations", the solution was always there, you just have to be willing to see it.The only thing that I would suggest is that you read the other books that are possibly in this series. Because I have never read any of the other books, some of the stuff I just didn't get or understand. And although it didn't take anything away from my enjoyment of the story, I was left with a few questions that I could not answer. For example, Abe made reference to his "Senator" wife who killed herself (he never said why), and that Dismas's first wife died, and then there was the whole "shootout" incident that apparently not only was Abe and Dismas involved in, but Cuneo's Lieutenant, who was killed was too. And as a reader, who has not read any of the other books, I still don't know what happened that was so upsetting to Abe and Dismas? So, I just would have liked a few sentences to explain those incidents. But overall, I liked this book and would recommend it.

Any opportunity to watch Jet Li and Jason Statham I take it, although I was not willing to pay to see it in the theater. Why do that when I can watch it on By Demand! Anyway, I find Jason Statham extremely sexy and looked forward to him dueling the ever talented Jet Li (who I simply love in most of his action adventure/epic movies). I also liked them in The One, which was a decent movie. But the big showdown that I was waiting for just never materialized.Statham, a federal agent is out for vengeance after his partner was killed following a bust. The story picks up three years later when Statham finds evidence that the elusive killer is still alive. The story is predictable and the showdown between the "good guy and bad guy" never materializes. I kept waiting for some really good martial arts scenes, and although there were a few they were far and inbetween.This movie a lot of potential, I am just not sure if it delivered.

If I could give this novel a 0, I would. It was not that the subject matter was not interesting (we have all read E. Lynn Harris), but it was disjointed and frankly not well written. King spent most of his novel preaching about "coming out because of all of the heterosexual women at risk" and yet in his own sexual encounters, never mention taking precautions to protect himself, his lovers, or their spouses/other lovers. I found that he was a hypocrite and insincere. If you want to talk the talk, walk the walk.Kings writing style also crippled the novel. He jumps from event to event, sexual encounter (his own and others) to sexual counters, preaches about God, coming out and the truth, while not really telling a clearly written and coherent story. At least E. Lynn Harris gives you a story, although it may lack finese, but it flows. Perhaps if King was not so arrogant he could tell a story that would mean something to the readers. He could have really given the public some real knowledge on the subject, while making you sympathize with him and others like him.If you are just compelled to read it, get it from a friend or the library....I definately wouldn't spend money on it.

Sayre Lynch (Hoyle) comes home following her younger brother's alleged suicide. Filled with regret (for not answering his calls) and anger (over past ills), Sayre plans to leave town and return to her quiet life in San Francisco. What she didn't count on was her attraction to her father's attorney, Beck Merchant.Sayre left town 10 years ago following a family dispute, and hasn't thought about returning. She hates her father, Huff Hoyle who runs the town foundry with an iron fist, having little time for unions or OSHA . And she doesn't trust her older, womanizing brother Chris. Believing that there is more going on in Destiny that meets the eye, all of which her father is responsible for, Sayre sets out to right several wrongs.Fighting their growing attraction, Sayre doesn't exactly trust Beck and wonders about his motives. As secrets emerge, what they discover together will rock the small town of Destiny and leave them both shaken.Although I would have left some of the chapters out (certain portions were drawn out unnecessarily) I still enjoyed this read. I won't say that the ending was surprising but well written and entertaining.

Jasmine (played by KeKe Palmer) needs a sitter for after school and her mom can think of no one better than her uncle Curtis (played by Ice Cube). With nothing in common, the two soon bond over football, and find that some of their interests are the same. While dealing with a father's absence (Jasmine), watching a town (Minden) die or struggle with high unemployment rates, and an uncle who is dealing with lost dreams (knee injury ended his football career) and depression, Jasmine's will prove that perseverance and setting seemingly impossible goals can inspire all. While her success inspires those around her to do better and motivates a dying town (because plants are closing/bad economy) to reclaim it's previous glory, Jasmine becomes the 1st black female quarterback to play Pop Warner football. I loved this story, and watched it with my two sons (ages 7 and 10) who were captivated by a tale of "Hope". Ice Cube and Palmer are extraordinary actors and loveable in these roles. Watch "The Longshots" and you too will be inspired.

I really wanted to give this one a try, but where there was potential, this novel failed. I hate to say it, but while I thought the premise was extremely creative...just imagine the story behind a charm bracelet and it's charms, the writing (different authors) fell flat. I really wanted to finish this book..and had to recheck it out of the library several times before I could finish it. Maybe the problem was that there were different authors, and not just one author with a vision. While this works with other authors, like those that collaborated on the Naked Came the Manatee novel, it didn't for these. I would recommend that if you are so moved to read it, make sure you get it from your local library.

I tried and I tried to read this book, but I could never get past the first couple of chapters. It was so bad, that although I traditionally believe that I should keep all my books, I am planning on putting this one out during a yard sale this fall. Maybe my trash will be someone elses treasure.

Sandra Brown created a torrid, political thriller in "Exclusive". Barrie Travis, a discredited Investigative Reporter, has been given the scoop of a lifetime. Apparently, the First Lady of the United States (Vanessa Merritt) is trying desperately to tell her some secret surrounding the death of her child, who was believed to have died from SIDS. Determined to follow the leads where they may, Barrie sets out to reveal the truth at all cost, even if it means risking her life. Meanwhile, the sexy and but grouchy, ex-Presidential Aide, Gray Bondurant, is determined to rescue the 1st Lady from those nefarious individuals who are determined to keep her quiet.There is an unscrupulous President with a secret to keep; doctors whose ethics have been compromised; a drug/alcohol abusing First Lady; a Mississippi Senator with his foot in politics and who appears to have created the perfect monster/political animal; an ex-military guy with no conscious; a decent plot and some sex thrown in for good measure. I enjoyed Exclusive and would definitely recommend it for those Sandra Brown fans or those short vacation readers. And while I thought the end was a little too clich&eacute;, and could have been better, it at least proved the old saying "everything is not as it appears".

I intentionally did not read this book following the Frey/Oprah scandal. I waited a couple of years and then read the book, how I think it should be read with no anticipation or expectation that the story is true or Frey's life story, but simply as a story. With that being said, I really enjoyed "A Million Little Pieces". The story relates the tremendous journey towards recovery for James Frey.The story begins with James waking up on a plane with no idea where he has been or what he has done. What he does know is that he is missing several teeth, covered in urine, throw-up and blood, and obviously in a lot of trouble. Taken to a rehab facility by his family, we see James attempt to understand why he has done some of the things that he has done, as well as make some of the decisions that he has made. With the new mantra ....."I am an alcoholic. I am a drug addict. And I am a criminal", James takes responsibility for his past actions, sets limits for his future sobriety and sets out to heal himself as only he can. Not a believer in the "12 step program" or a "higher being", he has decided to get sober on his own terms and in his own way.Along the way, James encounters a variety of people with the same issues of alcohol abuse and drug dependency. Among them: his friend and eventual roommate, clarinet playing Miles (a recovering alcoholic and federal Judge), Leonard (a drug addicted, alcoholic Mafia Boss), and Lily (a pill popping, crack addicted prostitute) who he loves unconditionally. He also makes a connection with Joanne, his counselor and her companion Hank.From the time we learn that James is going to have a double root canal (to fix his teeth that were broken during a blackout) without any pain killers (because he is a recovering addict), to his 22-page confession of bad decisions, rage and embarrassment, we HOPE that he will heal and become whole. So when we read that James stares as a mug is literally being "carried thru the dishwasher", which to me symbolizes his rediscovery of himself, we know that he will honor his pledge to get clean. Like the "mug" he had to experience rock bottom, go thru hard and challenging times to become a better person. I personally enjoyed the story, and while I have not personally experienced addiction, I know several who have. This gave me some insight into the process of getting better. So while the story may not have been true, I thought it was extremely entertaining.

Two daughters search for their fathers. A man searches for his Professor and his wife, who he believed were dead. Each search happens in a different time and place, but each storyline blends and intertwines to form a cohesive tale involving the very evil Vlad (AKA Dracula, the Conqueror or Vlad the Impaler). As each sets out on their journey to discover the truth, they eventually tell us a little about Vlad lure and history, all revealed thru letters and flashbacks.I will not say that "The Historian" was the most engrossing vampire read, but it was definitely not the worse. I thought the imagery and attempt at suspense building was ok, but it wasn't "can't put it down good"..instead it was definitely a slow, methodical process to reveal a truth that you always knew or suspected. If you need something historical, with a slight twist on the vamp theme (Dracula wants a library), then you'll enjoy it.

I must admit that I was a little torn when writing this review. First I like the continuation of the Pendergast, D'Agosta, Haywood, Constance and other characters, who appeared earlier in the series. There were a lot of things that I absolutely loved about it.....like the (1)unexplained hatred that Diogenes has for his brother Aloysius Pendergast (similar to the Cain and Abel storyline from the Bible); (2) the eternal love that Pendergast has for "complicated" one true love (who is kidnapped by Diogenes); (3)the continued appearance of Constance (who we still don't understand who and what she really is...besides a research genius); and (4) a host of new colorful characters (like the the wheelchair bound mercenary genius) and (5) reoccuring characters that we all know and love (Switchback, Green and several others). And finally, I even loved the final scene with "someone" (I don't want to give it all away) that we thought was dead, is alive and well. And sweet Aloysius is in a high maximum security prison for crimes he did not commit, with his friends rushing to help him escape. But where my concern comes, is with the following: (1) there were times when the storyline seemed forced and not that interesting. I mean you had this whole "Dangler" storyline that was mentioned throughout, but wasn't really relevant. I was also conflicted about (2) the path that the relationship between Lt. D'Agosta and Laura Hayward is taking. I was not sure if Preston and Child wanted to hook her up with D'Agosta's Sergeant, but I didn't think they should have broken up there relationship in the spirit of "protecting her".I kept thinking that D'Agosta should have just told her what was going on, versus I will put my happiness aside to protect my woman from the madman.): I will say that the positives outweighed the negatives and that is why I gave it a 4. It just isn't a strong 4, probably more of a 3.5. But to read how it all concludes, I will get the next one!!!!

A successful novel or at least a decent story is the result of some interesting characters (ie., quirky/sexy detective, her secretive/secret agent/special forces/moody/dark boyfriend...who comes in and out of the story to save the day and have great sex...a genius sidekick who is in lust with the sexy detective, but who is sleeping with the thick librarian...and a host of other characters)...a decent although predictable plot (I was not surprised who the murderer was...if you are a person who reads these type of suspense stories you will be able to guess)and a nice tone. I would recommend that you read this novel. I think there were more good points than bad.

"The Other Guys" was a smart comedy with just the right amounts of action and laughs. Will Ferrell plays Gamble, a dedicated, nerdy investigator who has been partnered with the disgraced Detective Hoitz (played by the surprisingly funny Mark Wahlberg) who ruined the World Series by shooting baseball giant, Derek Jeter. Because they are the laughing stock of the Department, each sets out to change his fate by doing something bold and fabulous. Gamble is on the trail of a Wall Street con artist who didn't keep up with his permit licenses, and Hoitz just wants to catch a bad guy and prove that he can do good police work. Using a Toyota Prius as their official police vehicle, they set out to solve a somewhat convoluted crime (ponzi type scheme which would eventually devastate the police pension fund) and we are witness to some of the funniest scenes in the movie. Gamble's eventual flashbacks on his own "life of crime" (he was a pimp in college), as well as Hoitz's reaction to Gamble's beautiful wife(played by Eva Mendes) will have you in stitches. I think some of the most overlooked stars of the movie (probably because they don't last long) were Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Samuel Jackson. I could not stop laughing when they jumped off a roof yelling "aim for the bushes", believing themselves to be indestructible or invincible. It was priceless. And not to be overlooked is the surprisingly funny Michael Keaton, who does a wonderful job playing the hard working, tough Police Captain who moonlights at the local Bed, Bath & Beyond. In conclusion, there are so many things that made this movie enjoyable, from the wonderful cast to the decent storyline. Most of all, it offers moments of pure fun. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.

If you are a person who wants to believe in conspiracy theories or believe that anything is possible, this is the novel for you. There are government biologically enhanced animals;bad guys; a group of soldiers who do only what they are told; a brief showing of Donald Trump; mention of Barbara Streisand; a pain-ridden ex-cop who is falling for a beautiful attorney, who is the daughter of the main character; a main character who is a zealot for environmental and conspiracy issues. It is a delightful, fast moving story that is extremely enjoyable.

This is one movie that I watch at least 4 times a year. I can watch it over and over and over. The cinematography is captivating, the acting is superior and the story is engaging. On top of that, the chemistry among the actors was apparent. Anthony Hopkins plays the father (Col William Ludlow) and patriarch of the family whose "city" wife left him because she did not love the mountains and rustic living. She leaves him with his loyal companion (the indian narrator, One Stab) and three sons Alfred (Adian Quinn), Tristian (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas). The stage is set early on for an epic tale that has tragedy, betrayal, and love.Early on we find out that Tristian has the spirit of his father. He loves his brothers, the land and the indian people. He is a free spirit who even fights a bear early in life. Which is significant because this same bear (it is inferred) kills him years later. So it is through One Stab's eyes and narrations, that we see the rest of the Ludlows Family life. We see Samuel return with a fiance' Susannah (Julia Ormond). We see the immediate attraction between her and the brothers. We find out that Tristian goes to war to protect and take care of Samuel. We see Tristian and Samuel go off to fight a war that their father opposes. We see Samuel die and Tristian return. We see how Tristian and Susannah appear to be attracted, but he leaves only to have Alfred marry her. We see her long for Tristian and the life that could have been. We see Tristian return to marry One Stab's daughter, Isabel and start a family. We see Susannah struggle with the realization that she can not have kids and wants the life that Isabel has. We see Isabel killed in a cruel twist of fate. We see Alfred realize how everything has a price even his happiness. We see Alfred survive his wife's suicide, only to realize how much family really means. And finally, we see how Tristian was always meant to be a kind spirit, with the Bear. He died as he lived, how he wanted.Although I have told you most of the movie, there is so much more. This, along with the Joy Luck Club, I love and highly recommend. Rent or purchase today. You would never regret it.

What is a Navy Seal to do when he arrives at his estranged wife's (Mary Lou) home only to find her shot to death in the kitchen and his infant daughter missing? Facing possible charges as a murderer and a traitor (to his country), Ringo/Sam finds himself aligned with his lost love, Alyssa to determine who, if not Mary Lou was responsible for a recent assassination attempt on the President, and is she a part of a terrorist cell bent on furthering the teachings of Al Queda, and will Alyssa finally face the truth that she is hopelessly in love with him?I really enjoyed this, my first Brockman novel, I thought the characters were endearing, smart and the story definately left me wanting more. There were so many subplots and future plots, that I immediately anticipated the next Brockmann purchases that I WILL make. So, if you like romance, suspense, military themed, suspense novels, this is the read for you.

LA Banks has done it once again, and I am left wanting more. In this, the 4th novel in her series, we find D and Carlos once again walking a fine line between the light and the dark. In the Bitten, Carlos feels that he has crossed the line and made the love of his life, D a vamp. After all, that is his darkest fantasy. While struggling to decide does he want her to live with him forever, or live as she is meant to, he decides which side he is on and fights for dear life. As he says in the "mind of a vampire" section, she was meant to be in the light, to eat, breath and live. And he would never deny her that.Through a series of adventures, they demonstrate how much their love means in the survival of the human race. Fighting all that he is, he continues to protect her from the dark side. Even after creating a drug that threatens to be his undoing, Carlos fights until the last minute to save the world, which he was always meant to do, after all he was suppose to be a guardian.LA Banks made my heart race, my dreams soar and my hope flourish because I want their love to survive, and Carlos to win his soul. On her website, she offers glimpses of what is to happen in the future. If what she implies happens, this series could only get better.Banks is truly a genius...and if there is a dark side, she has experienced it, only to know that good, will always triumph over evil. And remember to walk in the light.

Several people have reviewed this book so I will be brief. The story is simple, Mikhail Dubrinsky, Prince of the Carpathians and his lifemate, Raven are the hosts for a Christmas Celebration in the mountains of Romania. Torn between Carpathian ways and human holiday traditions, Mikhail struggles to solve his peoples problem with infant mortality, female infertility, battles with vampires, and threats on his life by unseen evil forces.The novel is filled with Carpathian hunters protecting their lifemates and children, while some are trying to find their "loves" to prevent them from becoming what they hunt, pure evil (vampires).Several characters are introduced and revisited, great battles are fought, lifemates are revealed (Savannah & MaryAnn), their magic and powers, as well as the normal Feehan sex scenes keep the reader drawn into Mikhail's world, as he shoulders the future of his people.Criticisms: (1) It wasn't really a stand along book. Because I have only read one other Dark Hunter book (Dark Demon), I was not familiar with all of the characters or the storylines. This was definately a continuing story, and the door to future books was left wide open. Also, (2) there was a great deal of build-up to the much anticipated Christmas Celebration only to have it only last a couple of pages.Pluses: (1) There will be future books. (2) There were some extremely funny scenes between the "big bad" hunters and their lifemates (who were long ago humans) who are trying to prepare meals for their human friends. Difficult because they no longer eat or practice the art of cooking. The combustible pies, jerky leather roasts, etc. leave you smiling. And finally, the storyline of how the Prince is planning on having his son-in-law, Grigori (AKA the Grouch and scary healer of the Carpathian people) play the role of Santa Claus (tights and all) is extremely funny (look for scene where all the hunters show up in the form of insects to watch!). I also enjoyed (3) the storyline of Savannah, who is a troubled teen with a disturbing past (which is revealed at the end of the book and you shouldn't be surprised who her father is). I also liked the fact that she will prove to be one Carpathian's salvation (Dimitri) when she grows to accept her role as lifemate. And finally, (4) the storyline involving MaryAnn (City girl turned Carpathian and counselor to troubled women) is extremely intriguing and although she is only mentioned towards the end of the story,and I can't wait to find out how she will be claimed by her lifemate (who is identified in this book, but I ain't telling).So give Dark Celebration a chance. It will be worth it.

Investigative reporter Rowena Price (Halle Berry) is trying to track down leads in her friends murder. Suspecting that it might be, business man/philander Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), Price goes undercover as an employee in his advertising agency. What could have been the typical suspense movie, ends up being a decent thriller with a twist at the end. There is everything that would make a story interesting...blackmail, suspense, romance, etc. And I'm not saying that Berry deserves an Oscar or anything, but I did enjoy the movie, and think that you will too!

I was pleasantly surprised when I read this novel. I guess I enjoyed it so much because I was expecting a lot less. When I have read Tyree in the past, I have hated it. Leslie however was great in that he left his normal comfort zone (sistah girl books I call them) and gave us something different. I loved the underlying plot of "dark magic", and I really enjoyed the struggle with the main character "Leslie" to find herself and love. I never hated her, I merely felt sorry for her. She was not the villian, as I am sure some think...she is really a survivor...one who experienced life, made bad choices and will survive although her underlying fragile psyche would not. Give this novel a chance, you will either love it or hate it, but no one that I suggested it to thought it was a waste of time. This novel will truly make you evaluate how if given the same circumstances you would respond.

That is what is most relevant to the story....like today, the vision of the future is of a society who desires perfection no matter the cost. Of course Eve, flawed and human as the next does not understand and never will why humans aren't satisfied.

What would happen if your mother forced you to prostitute yourself to the landlord to pay the rent? What happens when your mother starts running the hottest brothel in the city? What happens when you mother turns around and sleeps with your fiancee who doesn't know you prostitute? What happens when you find out that your mother biggest customer your fiancee's father? Well, I summed up the whole book for you. If you just feel, after reading my review that you want to read it anyway, get it from the public library. Maybe I am just not a Mallette fan, but when you are in several book clubs and have to read others selections, this is the type of garbage that you read. Skip it if you have a choice.

Jo Ellen, a reknown photographer has returned to her home after recieving several photos that contained the image of her missing mother. Determined to center herself, Jo has returned to the one place where she feels safe, Sanctuary. While returning to her roots makes her reflect on one of the most painful times in her life (her mother's disappearance) she finds love, in a childhood friend, Nathan. Surrounded by her siblings, a brother who has turned to cooking and a sister, who wants to be an actress and a father, who is extremely bitter, Jo realizes that she is being stalked and that her mother's disappearance may not be what it initially seemed and that her new love, Nathan may have information that will destroy her world. I enjoyed this novel, although I don't think you will be surprised by the ending, and would recommend that you read it if you like traditional Nora Roberts (romance, suspense and mystery).

I have to admit that I am a harsh critic, and that is why I gave this author another chance. I read Incubus dreams, which sucked....and everyone that I know who is a fan said "give her another try she is terrific". So, I picked "A Stroke of Midnight" because I really didn't think that I could stomach another Anita Blake novel, and picked this one because it was dealing with Fairies, something that I thought would be interesting. I WAS WRONG. Hamilton needs to get away from the sex just for the sake of having sex, while trying to rationalize that it is for the good of the country....Sithen...Unseelie...Seelie...Courts, whatever. The novel had a LITTLE promise at the beginning, a murder myster and then spiraled into a lot of nothing.....there were chapters and chapters of nothing....this person crying, dying, killing, having meaningless sex, talking about nothing...guards who love...and all want to get her pregnant to become King, understanding that they must share...a Queen who is psycho....Goblins, Fairies, Dragonfly-like creatures....some more stupid stuff....time stands still and I AM STILL WAITING FOR THIS MADNESS TO END. I still don't see the point. And the only reason that I am even giving this a 1 is because Hamilton took the effort to get it published. But finally I can say that I will never read another Hamilton novel again. One time shame on you....the second one, shame on me....I can't give another of her novels a chance because isn't three strikes you're out.To summarize.....Murder + Princess + sex + psycho Queen + Psycho cousin + crying/sexy guards + no real plot to think of = a HORRIBLE book.

I really enjoyed Remember When and realized by the time I got to the second portion of the book (futuristic 2059 with Lt. Eve Dallas), that I had indeed read another JB Robb novel. And no, I did not realize that Nora Roberts and JB Robb were one in the same. The book took place in the early 2003 (I think). The story revolves around a diamond heist, named the largest in New York history. Laine Tavish has created a new life for herself. Running from her past and her father, who is a reknown theif, Laine has settled into a quiet community and opened an antique store. Her long lost uncle reappears and is quickly killed, leaving a mystery of who is after Laine and why. Also, appearing around the same time is a handsome and mysterious stranger who unknown to Laine is an investigator trying to track down the diamonds, that he believes are in her possession. After several murders and a lot of romance, the story moves quickly and eventually to the bad guy getting his due and a small portion of the diamonds still missing.Fast forward 56 years, and we find that Laine's granddaughter has written a book that deals with the heist. While she is away on a book tour, her best friend is murdered in her home and the place is ransacked. Lietenant Eve Dallas and her handy sidekick Peabody are on the scene and ready to solve the mystery. As the story evolves, we see just how the diamond heist is related to the present day problems. Although this portion of the book barely focuses on Laine's granddaughter, I found it well written and interesting. As I said earlier, I realized that I have read a novel about Eve and her dashing and sexy, Irish husband Roarke. I really enjoy their relationship and the constant mentioning of their rocky pasts, especially Eve. I will make an effort to read other Robb novels to find out her past. I think she is a fascinating character that I can't wait to read more about.But, no matter what...I think Remember When is worth reading. Especially if you are going on a long car ride or plane trip.

Although some say that this novel was predictable, I found it to be entertaining and an easy read. Don't get me wrong, there were some predictable parts, but there were also some extremely creative parts as well.Briefly, the plot is as follows: twins (Gillian, one twin was undergoing invitro and the other Melina, a successful media escort); Chief, a half indian astronaut (who has demons of his own); Larson, a hardworking detective; Jim, a seemingly harmless fiancee' (to the twin undergoing invitro); a mentally disturbed killer; and Father Gabriel, an evangelist with delusions of gradeur (making as many babies as he can, who will eventually allow him to take over all aspects of industry and "control" the world) = a fascinating story.I am sure you know the plot, the twins switch places (the media escort switches with the twin undergoing invitro) and she and the dashing astronaut have a night to remember. Those exciting times are soon forgotten as the police discover Gillian's body, and words written on the wall pointing to Chief as the reason for her death. You guessed it, the surviving twin, Melina sets out to solve the mystery of her twins' death while trying not to fall for her sister's one time lover. While they search for clues, that eventually leads to a baby making/kidnapping plot, we learn all about Chief (his struggle to accept his mixed heritage) and Melina (who has so many secrets that she sometimes becomes overwhelmed by them). There are a series of twists and turns, but overall the story was good.

A very entertaining and quick read. The plot is simple, a successful supermodel (Rana Ramsey) is tired of the "supermodel life" and her overbearing mother and decides that she is going to live, incognito, in a boarding house in Texas. There, with a "not so brilliant" disquise of blue tinted glasses and extremely baggy clothes, she is finding the life she never had...a friend (elderly Ruby), a career (as a clothing designer, Ana R...Rana backwards), a sense of self-worth (people like her for her talent and not her looks) and now a love affair with a HUNKY, recovering from a shoulder injury, football star, Trent. He soon overlooks the ugly swan package and falls in love with the beautiful woman inside. Although, I found that the novel had a few loose ends, it was interesting to see how, why and when Rana (posing as the plain Ana) will reveal her true self to Trent. And the real question becomes, "will they live happily ever after"?

District Attorney Alex Cooper, along with Investigators Michael Chapman and Mercer Wallace, find themselves in the middle of two extremely complicated cases. The first involves the murder of prima donna/diva/ballerina Natalya Galinova in the Lincoln Center's Metropolitian Opera House. The other is the sexual asssaults of two Canadian tourist by a Turkish physician who doesn't mind using drugs to get what he wants. Following a series of clues, Cooper, Mercer and Chapman find that the art world is just as complicated and misleading as any other. Simply put, bringing bad guys to justice is more difficult than some would think, and it takes those who are truly dedicated to discovering the truth to get the job done. I thought the story was decent and the characters were well developed and likeable. It was a quick and easy read. The only thing is that I wish I had read other novels in the series, because I was unfamiliar with some of the underlying plots, and while the main storyline was new, the character's stories were on-going, and I was not familiar with them (for example, one of the Investigators recently lost his fiance'), which was a disadvantage in some regards. But overall, I enjoyed this story and look forward to my next Fairstein novel.

When I was asked to read another Lolita Files novel I cringed. I had read a few of her other books, and found that they lacked depth. So imagine my surprise when I read Child of God. Ironically, Files allowed us into a family that was so dysfunctional that you did not believe they would survive. There is intrigue, jealousy, pain, loss and sorrow, and eventually peace. The novel begins literally with a child burning alive in a fire, only to end in much the same way (figuratively). By the end of this novel, which at times was so dark and depressing that you have to swallow to get you through, you understand what things shaped and molded the characters, and why they were the way they were.I am glad that Files departed from her usual style and took a chance. It was worth it.

Sean Riley (Johnny Strong), a New Orleans Detective with no fear, has been in so many gunfights in the last four months that the department is starting to wonder how safe the criminals are with Riley on the street. Having recently lost his son to leukemia, and mourning the end of his marriage, Riley has turned to his work and bringing down the bad guys to soothe his soul. Working on a series of grisly murders perpetrated by some merciless killers with fellow Detective Will Gantz (Kevin Phillips), the two follow the clues where they lead. To complicate matters, Riley's friend, Colin (Sean Patrick Flanery), a mercenary and general screw-up, had made a sudden appearance. Colin is center in the middle of whatever is going on. Apparently, he is in possession of something that a bad guy, Raymond Crowe (Costas Mandylor) wants, and who will stop at nothing to get it back. Afterall Crowe has a secret, and is willing to silence all witnesses to keep it that way.Overall, I really liked Sinners & Saints. It was gritty and offered tons of entertainment. There were tons gunfights, lots of trash talk, a cocaine snorting bad guy, and a handsome leading man. The acting was decent (Tom Berenger is still solid as a rock) and I loved the gritty cinematography. And the only somewhat annoying thing about the movie was Gantz's character. There were times that he seemed to whine and I personally wanted him to "man up" and get in the game (and when he eventually takes some sort of stand, you will roll your eyes). But eventually you overlook his faults because you realize that Riley's character was strong because he had some life experiences (the military, his wife's departure and his son's premature death) that solidified his fearless personality, while Gantz was just "what he was" (a rookie detective who really had not been in the mist of action and had a lot to lose). Therefore, Strong's nothing to lose, yet sympathetic and brooding persona, definitely outshined those irritants and made this an entertaining and highly enjoyable movie. I give it a 4.5 or 5.

Although some readers would consider this story dated, I really enjoyed this novel by Nora Roberts. Grace, a crime writer, has decided to take some time off of her tour to visit her sister, Kathleen. Reeling from a recent divorce, Kathleen a teacher by day, and a phone sex operator by night, has become the obsession of a stalker. Grace comes home one night to find her sister raped and murdered. Partnered with her love interest, Detective Ed Jackson, Grace soon discovers that solving crime isn't as easy as it appears in her crime novels. With a few twists and turns, the story comes to a Nora-ish ending that leaves the reader satisfied.

I have to admit, after reading the last Stephanie Plum novel (#11), I was not in a big hurry to read another. But, surprisingly I found myself selecting "12 sharp" because I thought it would be a quick and easy read, but I didn't necessarily expect it to be as enjoyable as it was. I was delightfully surprised (yes, I have used surprisingly more than once)!!! Now I see why this series is loved by so many. In this latest installment in the series, Stephanie Plum (bail bondsman extraordinaire) finds herself "handcuffs" deep in the mystery of "who is Ranger and who has really kidnapped his daughter". There is still the obvious love triangle between Joe Morelli (homicide cop), Ranger (sexy, mysterious bail bondsman) and Stephanie (the quirky bondsman) and to me it gets even more complicated as the story progresses. Although she finally does admit how she feels, kind of. However, this story was so cleverly written that you appreciate Stephanie's dilemma and sympathize with her. The usual characters are still present and accounted for: Connie (the office administrator); Vinnie (the grouch); Lula (this time she wants to be a singer versus last time she was obsessed with losing weight....and some of those scenes with her singing in a band staring a drag queen are too hilarious); and Grandma (who is as crazy as usual....trying to open a casket at a funeral), are back and full of humor. There is also a new character that I hope returns, Melvin Pickle, who was caught doing something inappropriate in the movie theater.In the first few pages of the story, Stephanie is confronted by a woman who claims to be Ranger's wife. Ever mysterious, Stephanie soon learns that Ranger is the father of a young girl, who is now missing and believed to have been kidnapped by Ranger. As the story unfolds, we learn more (although not a lot) about Ranger and his past. As the story unfolds, between bringing in wanted people, Stephanie begins to realize that there is someone who wants to take over Ranger's life, and she is part of the big picture.Now of course, I have a few criticisms (only a 4 star rating) because it can't be all roses.....first, I think it was a tad unrealistic for Morelli (definitely an alpha male) not to be REALLY upset that Ranger was living with Stephanie, although brief. I think he would have staked his claim, no matter how understanding he is. And the same goes for Ranger! Ranger, who is always making clear that he gets what he wants, would have definitely been more assertive. I think that their efforts to all live happily after was a tad too unrealistic.And finally, the whole crazed ranger look-alike storyline feel apart at the end. Most of the novel was spent telling the reader how "crafty, skilled and cunning" the Ranger look-alike was, but in the end he fell apart. It turned out that he wasn't as skilled as he seemed. Although he eludes capture on more than one occasion, when you saw him up close and personnel, you weren't really impressed. He turned out to be a bit of a loon. Meaning when you really didn't see him, he was far scarier than he was close up. I guess that is a good thing, but it also was a bad thing because I felt the story felt apart. I knew the outcome.But overall, I really enjoyed this story more than the other. There were times that I laughed out loud. I mean there were some really funny scenes. So read it for a good laugh and enjoy! If pressed, I would probably give the book 4.5. LOL.

Have you ever read a novel that made you smile, cry and then laugh. This was the novel for me. Meet Cannie Shapiro, a plus size (although I never really got the impression she was really large, just not a 2 or a 4...maybe a 10...I can relate) whose ex-boyfriend has spilled his guts in a tell all Magazine article about loving and having sex with a larger woman. Stop laughing. Imagine how insecure you now feel, if you weren't feeling a little uncomfortable in your own skin before. After reading the article, the same article that her whole weight loss group is reading, she embarks on a journey to lose weight and get her man back. In a series of funny situations, that only the reader appreciates, Cannie begins to rid herself of demons that she has had for some time. This novel is simply wonderful, from her exboyfriend's father's funeral, to her lesbian mother, to her pregnancy and self-discovery you applaud her. What is most profound is when you the reader realize that there is a little Cannie Shapiro in all of us. Yes we cry, but we also survive the hurt to grow and find love again. So purchase this book and enjoy. You will not regret.

Although I don't agree with the comparison to Laurell Hamilton (I hate Hamilton), I will say that I enjoyed Kelley Armstrong's first novel, Bitten. I felt that the characters were well developed and the plot was clear and effortlessly told. You developed an attachment for the characters and understood their idiosyncracies. Meet Elena, who was bitten by her first love Clay and turned into a werewolf. She is the only female in existence and fights daily to deny what she has become. Meet Clay, who bite her (I think because he loved her and didn't know what else to do) and has to live with the consequences of his actions, being alienated for a short time from the pact and having her leave, once she is taught the ways of the "werewolf" with her vowing never to return. But she does reluctantly, leaving a too sweet boyfriend,when the pact leader "Jeremy" calls her. She comes back to the pact to solve the mystery of who is killing near their safe haven. As the story unfolds, Armstrong does something that most writers do not have the ability to do, she weaves a story filled with mystery and romance. You come to understand the relationships that exist for those in the pact and you will not stop reading until the end. This novel left me wanting more and I can't wait to read another Armstong novel. So I will say this, if you love LA Banks (Vampire Huntress Series), Sherrilyn Kenyon or Lori Handlehand, you will love Armstrong.

I read this collection of short stories in a day. I thought that they were quick and easy reads, that were both entertaining and cute. I had never read a Davidson novel and enjoyed it. I will not reharsh what others have said but basically the formula for the stories are as follows. Boy (a goul or fiend) meets girl (a goul or fiend) and fall in love. They accept each other as they are and live, we assume, happily ever after. In "Santa Claws", Alex Kilcurt (a lonely werewolf) meets Giselle (a human)and falls passionately in love. Will she accept him as he is, with claws and all? "Monster Love", finds Janet Lupo (a werewolf) meeting Richard Will (a Vamp). Will the duo stay together forever? In "There's no such thing as a werewolf", Drake Dragon (a blind werewolf) meets Crescent Muhn (a loveable but troubled tattooed girl) and falls in love. But just what is she? And finally "A fiend in Need" stars Antonia (a werewolf who has visions, but can not change) and a silent vamp named Garrett Shea. Will they love each other for eternity? Get the book and read it. You will not have to think hard and will be entertained.

Overall, I probably would give this a 3.5, but when it came to really taking a stand, I gave it a 3 versus a 4 for one simple reason, it was an interesting read, but was not as good as some of the other things that I have read by Margolin.Ok here is the plot in a nutshell.....Secret Government Agency lead by a evil presidental candidate + secret plots + odd attack at baseball game by a guy who is not what he seems (an assassin turned furniture maker) + a mentally ill daughter of the evil presidental candidate who writes for a tabloid newspaper + a zealous prosecutor + inexperienced defense attorney + an unbelievable story that no one believes told by an assassin and an ex-mental patient. However, the results were somewhat lacking. Something was missing from the story...I think Margolin could have come up with some other way for the main character to get public attention than him stabbing an irate father, during a little league game, while countless little kids and their parents watched in horror. But this was the catalyst that set the gears in motion. I just think Margolin could have been more creative than that.

My annual ritual is to look in the mirror, decide it is time to shed my "winter coat", lose weight and eat better. This started last month and when I got the opportunity to order this, I jumped on it. Healthy, purely organic, who could beat that promise? Especially when I have tried several other protein bars, and found only one other that I like (Luna bar). Although I usually go for the chocolate/peanut butter because the taste and texture seem to be acceptable to my tastebuds, I thought that a cherry protein bar would be interesting. The bar wasn't too sweet (as a matter of fact, not sweet at all), and does offer a somewhat pleasant cherry taste. The only thing that I was not "wild" about was the texture, but true protein bar lovers, won't mind that at all. Did it satisfy me as a healthy snack? Yes, although I am not sure that I would run out and buy tons of them for my regular snack between meals, but as an occassional fruit treat, I will definitely consider it.

Maybe it was the fact that the movie did not meet my expectations, or maybe it was the fact that I wanted to see more in a Vin Diesel Sci-fi movie (like Chronicles of Riddick, Pitch Black), or in a action/adventure thriller (like XXX). Whatever the reason, I was very disappointed in Babylon A.D. You had everything that should have made this a fantastic movie...decent actors, a plot with potential and great special effects, but you didn't have a plot that was well executed and nothing really original. There were several bites off of other sci-fi movies, with no real twists or variations. And at the end of the movie, I just felt a little cheated.Toorop (Vin Diesel) has been asked to deliver Arora and her guardian/protector, Neolite (Yeoh) from a convent to the US. Apparently the younger woman has something that everyone wants and what it is you have to sit thru several brilliantly choreographed fight scenes, sizzling special effects to find out. However, although you will find yourself mildly amused and entertained, you will also find yourself looking at the person next to you and saying, "did I miss something?" or "did I fall asleep"? Perhaps better plot execution would have made this movie more appealing to the average Sci-Fi lover.

Adam Sadler is a hoot as an Israeli born Intelligence Agent with dreams of being a master stylist for Paul Mitchell. Faking his death, while fighting his Palestinian arch enemy "The Phantom" (played by John Turturro), Zohan heads for America to fulfill his dream of remaking 1980's hairstyles all the rage. Dressed like a "disco-dancer", Zohan sets out to make women beautiful while also pleasuring them, hence working his magic. Eventually Zohan falls in love with his Boss; helps a community to realize that they should set their differences aside and stand up to a greedy land developer who wants their property to build a mega mall; faces a person (played by Rob Schneider) whose goat he once stole to humiliate him; and battles his arch enemy who he realizes he has more in common with than he once thought (Phantom wants to sell shoes). All these things and much more make this a satisfying comedy. So if you want to laugh, out loud, get this movie!

Although written some time ago, this is yet another Sandra Brown novel that is quick and easy to read. Here is the plot made simple: bad boy/daredevil (Cage, who is often misunderstood and harshly judged) + good son/religious zealot/martyr (Hal, who is following in his father's footsteps to be a minister) + beautiful/orphaned/virginal woman (Jenny) + hypocritical parents + forbidden love (both brothers love the same woman) + death (good son dies) + secret (Bad boy slept with good girl pretending to be brother)+ fast car (I let that one slip) + near disaster + pregnancy = a great/entertaining story.

Have you ever watched a movie that left you simply speechless and fulfilled? Well, August Rush left me feeling that way! I vaguely remember when this movie was released, and not hearing a thing out it. But when it was released on DVD, I said "what the heck, give it a try". It was surprisingly, one of the best, well written and well thought out movies that I have read in a long time. I simply loved the story, the acting, the music...everything.Evan (AKA August Rush) was always sure about two things in life, (1) he heard music in everything, and (2) his parents were looking for him! Starting with vivid imagery and personal narrative, Evan describes how he feels about his life and music, while always feeling different from everyone else. As he begins his personal journey, we see how truly special he is. We soon learn the story behind his birth (one night of passion between two musicians, Louis and Lyla), and how he was eventually put up for adoption, by Lyla's very over protective father, who thinks it is in her best interest. Escaping his group home and "following the music", Evan has a series of misadventures as others discover his genius. During his journey, Evan never gives up faith that he will find his parents. And while some try to use Evan (the Wizard, played by Robin Williams), some try to help him (Terrance Howard), some try to find him (Lyla), some befriend him (two lovable and equally talented kids) and some discover him (his unbeknowest father, Louis).Since so many others have reviewed this movie, I won't say too much more except to watch this movie. You will smile, cry and laugh. It will leave you with a feeling of hope!

Arcane society Librarian/Ex-Butler Grace Renquist has been asked (by Fallen Jones and J&J;), to go to Hawaii and identify an evildoer by his "aura". Luther Malone, a recovering J&J; Agent and bodyguard, has been asked to accompany her and protect her at all costs. Battling their individual demons (Grace can kill with her touch when pushed into a corner, while Luther was shot during his last mission leaving him dependant on a cane), this paranormal couple, who are drawn to each other and into the mystery of an organization known as Nightshade, find themselves in the middle of a mystery when suddenly the person they identify dies under mysterious circumstances. Soon they are in over their heads into a conspiracy that involves a psychic enhancing drug; a kind of corporate take over; drug addicted psychics with heightened paranormal talents; a siren (LaSirene) who is slightly unbalanced and can kill with her voice, and a family of assassins.Lately, I am beginning to find Krentz novels a bit disjointed and unfortunately that is why I rated this book a 2, maybe a 2.5. Most times, Krentz assumes the reader is familiar with the storyline and doesn't explain certain things. Also, she never departs from the same cookie-cutter concept that she uses in all her novels. Meaning, you usually have somewhat attractive women (with enchanting eyes, leather coats and boots, or a great hair cut), with psychic powers, who meet a J&J; operative/agent and falls into bed and in love with him after just a few days. Oh yeah, I forgot, usually these women have had few sexual experiences, and the man finds himself bonded or fiercely protective of them almost immediately. I just would like Krentz to come up with something that makes my mouth water. Each of her Arcane novels seems to end abruptly with no resolution, and to be honest we need something new and creative. For example, I would like to see Fallen Jones fall in love and finally learn who is at the helm of the Nightshade organization. Hopefully, future novels will be better.

I read this book a couple of years ago, and now that the movie is out, the hype is back. I thought the book was just OK, nothing more and wondered why I never wrote a review. I will probably see the movie to see if that sparks some love for the book. I think the plot was ok, but there were parts of the novel that seemed to go on and on...and on. I wanted to know more about the albino killer,or just something more interesting. I guess I simply wanted more. And the problem that I had with the novel is that there was really nothing TOO original...you have religious zealots, secret organizations, secret conspiracy, killers, wealth, beautiful landscapes and a girl who is attracted to a guy, but nothing happens. The only thing that you didn't have, that I can remember that is, is romance. I was even hoping for a little romance to spice up the adventure. Oh, and did I forget to say it was kind of like reading about a treasure or scavenger hunt. Maybe you should not take my advice and read it yourself.

It wasn't that I thought that this was the absolute worse book that I have ever written, but I think it was lacking something. It could have been that there was great build-up to a showdown, that was really anticlimatic at best.Vicki, is a waitress (or server I think they prefer to be called) at a local diner, and notices a mysterious stranger who visits regularly, but doesn't eat, or come out during the day (hint). Meanwhile, there is a serial killer out there hunting red heads (Vicki is one)and leaving them drained of blood. Who could the killer be, the handsome stranger that she has seen leave the diner with two of the victims.Antonio, the mysterious yet handsome stranger, decides that he will warn all red heads of the perils of inviting a stranger into their homes. And yet they still are dying at alarming rates. His only annoying trait to me what his constance references to Vicki as either "Sweeting", "Sweet" or "Sweetness". I kept thinking, to be so ruggedly suave and old, shouldn't he say things that were more modern and endearing?The book has the normal stuff found in vampire books, a ghost, a vampire hunter, some humans who know of the vampires existence and a really, really bad guy. What little that the story had that was different, was so buried in such stupidness that you really didn't appreciate it. Do I regret reading it? Not really, I was able to read it in two days and although I probably won't remember this novel this time next year I was slightly entertained.

Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles returns from Paris (where she attended a conference) only to find her "doppelganger" (body double) shot to death in a car, practically at her front door. Believed to be Isles, Detective Jane Rizzoli and several others who know and have worked with her, have been called to the scene. So imagine everyone's surprise when Isles walks thru the door, alive and well, asking what's happened and why is there a crime scene near her home? Eight-months pregnant and waiting for her FBI Agent husband (Gabriel Dean) to return, Rizzoli sets out to identify Isles' body double and unravel the mystery of who Isles' double was. While DNA tests prove that the victim (Anna) was none other than Maura's twin (who she never knew about), Isles and Rizzoli sets out to determine why she was killed and was Isles the intended victim. But what Isles didn't expect to find was a birth mother who has a history of murder and madness, or a family history littered with death and mayhem (i.e., baby thefts).Maura Isles realizes with the death of her twin that she knows even less about her lineage that she initially assumed. Maura always knew that she was adopted, but at forty, divorced and a little lonely, she didn't expect to discover that her mother is a killer who is housed in a local mental institution. She also didn't expect to find out that her family was involved in such an unsavory business and that involved murdering pregnant women along the east coast or selling them. Tracing Anna's final steps before her death, she meets Detective Rick Ballard who wants nothing more than to save Maura from Anna's fate. He is but the first step in Isles quest for the truth.Meanwhile, Mattie Purvis, the pregnant wife of an ambivalent BMW dealer, finds herself buried alive and left with very little to survive (chocolate, water and a pot to use the restroom). Someone is holding her waiting for her to give birth. However, the question in the mind of the reader is what does this case have to do with a teen who was abducted years earlier, or the remains of several murder victims? Rizzoli and Isles set out to discover the truth no matter where the roads lead.What I enjoyed about this book was while everything seems to be connected, you were never really sure that it does. You find yourself wondering if coincidence and chance mean anything in this tale of murder and mayhem. There are tons of red herrings and tons of clues that do and don't necessarily mean anything. But underneath it all, there is a suspenseful and engaging story by an entertaining writer. This may have been my first Rizzoli and Isles novel, but it won't be my last.

A claustrophobic, virginal, dysfunctional, young (maybe 27)school teacher (Laney)meets a handsome, confident (at times arrogant), loving, older (42) New York attorney (Deke) meet during a brief black out in the Big Apple. They spend one magical night together (where she looses her virginity and he finds love), that will change both of their lives forever. Laney who had been told when she was young that she was barren, finds herself pregnant from a one night stand. The rest of the story resembles the typical Sandra Brown love story in that Deke tracks her down, showers her with love and attention, something she is starving for, and sets out to exercise the demons that her mother has instilled in her. Apparently Laney's mother "resented her and couldn't love her" because she blames Laney for her husband's departure. Deke's desire to be apart of Laney's life and his unborn child spins a cute story that is easy to read and not too heavy. I enjoyed it.

My son decided to wrestle this year for his middle school. I was surprised! In the past he has leaned towards other non-contact sports. He has played baseball competitively (on various travel teams) since he was 5. He even tried his hand at rec football (yeah I was surprised by that one too) but he announced that he didn't think he would be pursuing football at his middle school. So when he came home and announced that he was "trying out for wrestling" I was baffled, but decided not to worry UNTIL he made the team. So when he came home and said that he MADE the 8th grade wresting team, I immediately had visions of people with "cauliflower ear and other wrestling injuries". So the only way I was going to feel better about his decision (after all I am supportive) was to make sure that he has the best possible headgear (safety equipment) available. His father and I read some reviews and searched on-line for various opinions/options, and finally decided that this Cliff Keen F5 Tornado Headgear seemed like the perfect place to start. It appeared to be reliable, or as reliable as something protecting your head can be while playing a contact sport. So although I knew that I would still worry, what could I do besides have faith that a product (recommended by some who have been involved in the sport for a lot longer than I), would do what it is suppose to do, protect my 13-year-old son during his matches?I must say after observing several middle school wrestlers grapple and grab at each other (some with no headgear at all), I decided that the $40 investment was well worth it. I have only seen my son's headgear slip once, and that was because the kid he was wrestling grabbed on to it for extended amounts of time. And while it did slip some, it remained firmly on his chin, with only the top belt slipping onto his forehead. But once he was able to push away for his opponent, he was able to cooly slip the top strap back in place (quickly and easily). Otherwise, no matter the hold or the force used, the Cliff Keen F5 Tornado Headgear appears to stay in place.What I like about them.... Well, first of all, his ears are extremely protected! I don't really worry since I have never seen it come off completely during a match (but remember I have seen it slip once onto his forehead). All in all, I think those are some very good odds, especially since I see a lot of kids lose their headgear or not wear any at all (which I still don't understand). Second, the Tornados are somewhat stylish (hey I am a Mom but I am also clearly a girl). I was able to order these in all black which coordinates with his wrestling singlet (I affectionately call it an onesie) and shoes. And finally, I also like the fact that this headgear is easy to clean. I simply put a small pack of Clorox wipes (in his bag) and told him to wipe them off following their morning and afternoon conditioning. And if he is worried that he used too much, I told him to wipe them off again with a slightly damp cloth and let them dry. So far there has been NO discoloration or ANY SMELL! They have held up pretty well to be used daily.What my son likes about this headgear.....after all he is really the consumer. He says that they are light weight, and extremely comfortable. He said that there is a lot of room for his ears, which are surrounded by soft padding/material, and that he can barely tell that the chin strap is on. But most importantly he feels that his ears are safe. All in all, I think that we got our money's worth. While they may not have been the cheapest out there or the most expensive, they definitely have the features that I think are essential for any young wrestler. My son's health is definitely worth the extra money! Afterall, he is my biggest investment. I wholeheartedly give this product a 5.

Jude Murray doesn't know what has come over her. Leaving all that is familiar (a job as a Psychology Professor and her family), and determined not to do what is expected, she travels to (Ardmore in Ireland), hoping to find something, just what she doesn't know. Determined to escape her past and what she considers to be her failings (a husband who betrayed her and a job that leaves her feeling unfulfilled), Jude sets out to discover her roots and explore a country with tons of promise and hints of charm. Meeting and falling in love with pub owner/strong willed Irishman Aidan Gallagher, wasn't what she was expecting and not at all what she was looking for. Determined not be heartbroken again, Jude sets out to blaze her own way, even if it means writing a novel filled with fanciful stories to include one of a Fae Prince and his lost love. Woven throughout this modern tale is a sweet story of a fae prince (Carrick) who regrets not telling the woman his soul-mate that he "loves her" but instead offers her jewels in an attempt to woe her. What the Prince needs to break the curse (that he made in anger) is to find three couples who love and accept each other unconditionally. As luck would have it, Jude is the first to receive a gift of a priceless jewel that could hold the key to ending the Prince Carrick's loneliness and bring two long lost lovers back together."Jewels of the Sun" was entertaining, sweet and romantic. From the majestic cliffs of the enchanting countryside, to the local pub (owned by the Gallaghers), you get a picture of Ardmore, its surroundings and its people. With just the right amount of the paranormal (a fae prince offering jewels to a mortal woman), not to mention lost love, new love and a few regrets, and a Nora Roberts introduces us to the Gallagher and Ardmore in the first book in the trilogy.

"10 Years", is a slow moving yet insightful drama about friends returning for their ten-year high school reunion. Of course things have changed and nothing turned out quite like they thought. There is the man (Cully) who married a cheerleader (Sam) who seems to love his life (as a car salesman, husband and father), but wonders if he is missing out on the carefree lifestyle that his classmates have. Not to mention he can't wait for the reunion because he intends to apologize to all of those that he harassed or bullied. There is Jake, who can't move forward with his new love, until he stops pondering the what ifs when it relates to his ex, Mary. Then there is the rock-star Reeves, who has been in love with a classmate since Physics class, who never knew he existed. And finally there are two friends, who are competing for the attention of the home coming queen (whose life has not turned out quite like she had hoped). As in real life, all wonder where life is taking them and marvel at where they have been. And while there was nothing really original about the story, I thought that the actors did a decent job with the script they had. Overall, I give "10 years" a 2.5-3.

I guess my view of this novel is different than some of the reviews that I have read. I have NEVER read a more powerful novel than "The Lovely Bones". I work in the Criminal Justice field and I was finally glad to see a story that wasn't wrapped up tightly, where like reality, sometimes the bad guys get away with the crime.The novel is narrated by a murdered 14-year-old girl. Not bitter about her death, but simply watching the nightmare that the survivers are experiencing play out. Susie watches everything from "heaven". She flashes back on her death by her neighbor; she watches her father search for her killer; she witnesses her mother who is unable to cope leave, searching for answers; she sees her sister struggling to come of age in the shadow of her dead sister while making decisions that have long reaching consequences; she sees her brother struggling to keep it together; while her killer continues to cover his tracks (he buries her in a safe). What is so powerful about this novel is it's attempt to get the reader to see the impact that this tragedy has on everyone involved. There are moments in the novel that I am sure will make you weep and smile. But perhaps the most insightful thing about the novel is that the victim, Susie, in all of her wisdom, at the tender age of 14 wanted more for her family. She wanted them to survive and find each other during their time of sorrow. Like a child, she does not have anger or hatred in her heart. Because part of moving on is Forgiveness, and while adults have a hard time accepting that, Susie did.

Life is what really happens when you're busy making plans...or something to that effect. That or something close to it explains my feeling of Patterson's Alex Cross and oddly describe my feelings about "Cross" the novel. I have to admit that I had stopped reading the Alex Cross series a while ago because I had grown tired of the same cookie cutter stories. Alex gets a big case...the killer challenges the illustrious Alex Cross to catch him if he can...driven, Alex comes up with a profile of what and who he thinks the killer is...eventually in classic Alex Cross style, he unveils the killer (maybe injured) with the help of his handy sidekick and friend, Sampson (the large yet loveable childhood friend)..all while worrying about his grandmother (Nana Mama) and his kids...and all while still grieving for his perfect, beloved and murdered wife, Maria. And I almost forgot, Alex is usually solving some pretty horrific crimes while discovering that his close friend is also a crazed serial killer who hates his guts (Craig). So, I left Alex, and started to read other series (Banks, Robb, etc) or other Patterson collaborations (which didn't always prove good), and wondered "where did the Patterson magic go? Believe it or not, I found some of what attracted me to the series has returned. I am not sure if it was my break from Patterson's Cross or if this particular novel answered some of those pesky questions that I had formulated over the years and was glad some of the issues were resolved. Like "Why Alex can't have a decent relationship with a woman" (he hasn't gotten over Maria) or why Alex finds himself attracted to women that aren't always good for him. Of course there were still things that kind of annoyed me, like Sampson calling Alex "Sugar" constantly distracted from the dialog. But I put that aside and just didn't think about it too hard, and enjoyed the story.Now on to the book...."Cross" finds Alex on the trail of the man who he believes (for over 10 years) is responsible for his beloved wife Maria's death. "The Butcher", a psychotic, Mafia hired assassin/hitman (who is extremely fond of a scapel), not only murders for money but enjoys raping women too. A father and husband by day, Michael Sullivan (AKA The Butcher) does what he wants, when he wants and doesn't care what anyone thinks. Matching wits with his past nemesis Cross, Sullivan sets out to get revenge against those he believes have wronged him, while protecting his family in his own way, and maintaining/strengthening his image as a crazed killer. As Alex finally deals with his guilt for not being able to save Maria, and continuously places his life in jeopardy, Alex enjoys his retirement from the FBI and his move back to his practice as a psychologist. He finally gets some closure.So while I do not think that this is Pattersons most prized novel, I do think that it was an improvement from some of his earlier works. I was glad to see the piano playing, self-sacrificing Alex and the familiar crew once again.

Drew (short for Andrew) is a successful novelist who appears to have everything. He has a hit thriller series, a nice large home in Atlanta, several wonderful friends, and is eagerly awaiting his new book deal (which promises to make him hundreds of thousands). The only thing missing is the love of a good woman, or to finally admit that he is in love with his best friend, Carmen. A slave to habit, his life, which is clearly outlined and followed, is disrupted when he meets the "woman of his dreams" (Mika) in Starbucks. She seems, initially, to be everything he wanted....beautiful, smart, rich, sexy and seemingly independent. However, after a night of passion, Mika turns into something he doesn't want and can't handle. As the novel unfolds, Massey introduces an element of the supernatural that promises to hold the attention of the reader until the very end. With a stormy parental relationship with his father, and his mother's psychic dreams, Drew realizes that he is in trouble, but is unsure of how to escape the one he thought that he desired. Filled with psycho cats, a sweet ghost named Sammie, and a scary groundskeeper (Walter), this novel has it all.....a little romance, some mystery, some deaths and a great story. I won't tell you what or who Mika is, reading this novel will tell you that, but I will say that Massey is among the few today who can create a story to be rivaled by Tanarive Due or Octavia Butler. Read this novel and you will not regret it.

What do you think of a Vampire Queen (Elizabeth AKA Betsy) who is having a birthday (her 31st); who has decided to stop drinking blood; whose best friend a human has cancer and doesn't want to change (Jessica); whose sexy lover is a Vampire King (Eric Sinclair); whose life story has been written and about to be published by a guy whose mind she thought had been erased; who writes articles about her adventures as a Vampire in the local paper, who everyone thinks is a satire; whose sister is the daughter of the devil, but goes to church (Laura); whose stepmother she hates; who has a delegation of Elder Vampires who aren't crazy about her being their Queen; who lives with a gay Doctor who loves vampires (Mark); and a friend who wants to turn her human lover into a vampire because she loves him (Sofia); and who has a Zombie living in her attic (unbeknowst to her)? That is what this quick tale is all about and a lot more, but that is enough to spark your interest.The only criticism I have is that I listened to the audio version (Atlanta has terrible traffic, especially if you live in the suburbs!!!!!!). The voice of aweful.....I hated it. She sounded extremely annoying and although I know that being slightly flightly is what is so appealing about Betsy, hearing someone pretend to be flighty and dumb was a bit much. However, because I have read a couple of the Davidson stories and was familiar with the characters, I continued to listen to the story. I thought that it was cute and didn't take too much thought, especially in traffic. So enjoy.If I could, I would give it a 3.5.

I had high hopes for this film (although the clue should have been that it went straight to DVD) because I remember FONDLY the original. I mean I actually drove to Blockbuster, even though I have become a "by demand" junkie. Never having to leave the house and clicking "buy" while sitting on your sofa. How easy can renting a video get? I kept seeing the advertisements and was too impatient to wait. Anyway, while I was driving, I thought "how bad could it be" with a Sutherland (Keifer played in the original along with Jami Gertz and Corey Haim)? It is my opinion that Lost Boys II is really, really bad. I mean, you would think that with a better budget and better special effects, it should have been a decent film, or at least as good, if not better than the original.Ex-surfer with issues turned guardian (Chris) and his sister (Nicole) move to Luna Bay (renting from their aunt) where people "mysteriously disappear" all the time. Coincidence? Probably not! On top of that, Chris wants to protect his little sister from the sexy but slightly weird, ex-surfer, Shane (played by Angus Sutherland, Keifer's younger brother), who left the surfing circuit mysteriously. Where has Shane been and what has he been up to? Soon, Chris begins to suspect that the strange occurrences in Luna Bay may be related to the mysterious Shane and his group of followers, who are all adrenalin junkie/video playing pranksters (they jokingly eviscerate each other). Anyway, the story is pretty predictable...boy meets girl; boy decides he wants girl for an eternity; boy (who is secretly a vampire) tricks girl into drinking his blood, thus partially turning her; brother of girl knows something strange is going on in this small town and has a dislike for the bad boy; brother feels a duty to protect sister and prevent her from becoming the undead by taking a life; boy decides to embrace (only partially) the dark side; vampire hunter schools boy on the basic vamp tricks and terminology; brother along with vampire hunter, Edgar Frog (whose voice goes with his name) attempt to locate the nest of the vamps; and finally a big showdown between bad boy vamp and brother where sister must decide whose side she is on.Why then, if the movie was so bad did I give it a star? (1) Because I really liked the remake of the theme song; (2) Angus Sutherland was ok and I do see potential; and (3) because I loved the original.

Maybe my rating of this book is high because I compared it to another Patterson novel that I read recently, "The Quickie". While the Quickie seemed to be a departure from Patterson's normally realistic thrill ride,"The Honeymoon" didn't.The plot...interior designer Nora Sinclair seems to be perfect in just about every area of her life....she has the perfect guy(s); she is successful and talented; BUT her lovers seem to die after transferring large sums of money to off-shore accounts. Enters, the very dashing Craig Reynolds, insurance investigator to investigate the latest death of Nora's lover/fiance'. Soon both realize that nothing is as it seems and no one is who they claim. As the story unravels, it is not the unveiling of who the murderer is that makes the story work (afterall, it is pretty clear who the killer is and why they are doing it), but how the other plots in the story are woven into the larger picture. Unlike some of Pattersons other collaborations, this one works!

Although it could have been shorter, the story, the characters and the writing were wonderful.D'Agosta, a New York Cop (Lieutenant)turned writer turned South Hampton Detective (Sergeant) is on the case of a horrific murder. Enters Agent Pendergast/FBI/Genius who studies unusual or supernatural murders. As the plot develops, we see a series of bizarre murders that appear to be supernatural in nature, and a host of other interesting and colorful characters. We have bad guys, contract killers, satanist, religious zealots, beautiful pale women, strong female captains, ex-wives, and villians. We have picturesque landscapes and a intricately woven tale, that ends up not being so supernatural at all. Even the epilogue leaves you with questions and it does not appear to be out of the realm of possibility for the characters to return. I would suggest that you get this on audio tape so that if you are like me, and have traffic, you can listen to the tale while driving. And if all else fails, read it, the old fashion way.

Dr. Mack Booke has come to Three Sisters Island to see if there is anything to the notion that the Island was forged by three witches and has supernatural power. The geeky, accident prone Professor did not expect to encounter the very capable Sheriff Ripley Todd who seems to fascinate him both physically and mentally. Fearing that she will make the same mistakes her ancestors made, Ripley stopped using her supernatural powers long ago and is determined to suppress her magic. Love, coupled with her desire to protect those she loves, Ripley eventually confronts her fears and the very real danger that the group faces. With an evil from the recent past (Nell's ex-husband) still on all of their minds, the three women (and the men that love them) wonder what the darkness they feel truly means.This is the 2nd in the Sisters Island Trilogy. I enjoyed seeing the gang again...Nell is living happily ever after with Sheriff Zachary Todd (Ripley's brother), there are hints of things to come concerning Mia (who lost her love years ago), and there are even premonitions about all of their futures. However, what I really enjoyed the most was the evolution of Ripley, seeing how she comes to find love and an acceptance of her gifts, which will work well when it comes to the eventual showdown that I am sure will take place in Book 3, Mia's story.I recommend this story to any readers who enjoy Nora Roberts. She has woven a decent story that has some supernatural happenings and romance.

Mia Devlin is one of the three witches that reside on Three Sisters Island. She controls "fire" and has always embraced her independence and power. For most of her life, Mia has always known what she has wanted. At the top of her list was Sam Logan, the son of a prominent family from Three Sisters. Of course, unsure of what he wants or what he wants to do, Sam left Three Sisters eleven years ago...headed to New York hoping to carve out his own life and make his own way. Broken hearted, Mia has never loved again or gotten tangled into another relationship since, but instead has focused on other things in her life. Now she spends most of her time practicing her magic, spending time loving her friends and fellow witches (loveable Nell and spunky Ripley), all while running her successful bookstore. So when Sam returns to town, wanting to reclaim not only the family business (a hotel) but Mia, she isn't sure how to react (initially but eventually they come to an understanding, sex only, no relationship). She will not risk her heart again, and definitely isn't willing to share her body and her magic with him and get burned again. But the evil presence that has been threatening to return to Three Sisters after being banished from the island by their ancestors (Nell, Ripley and Mia) and has taken the form of an evil wolf, has returned and wants no demands Mia's death. Everything and everyone Mia knows and loves is at stake. The question becomes, will Mia risk her heart to save all that she loves and use her magic to destroy the evil that threatens her very existence.I enjoyed this novel. While it reminds me, in theme and plot to some of the other Nora Roberts books. You know the time honored proven plot of woman loves man, unconditionally...when he breaks her heart and leaves to "find" himself, only to return and stop at nothing to get the girl back...AND there is some danger out there that they must join forces and fight together. [Very similar to her recent Sign of Seven trilogy.] BUT no matter how many times we have heard and read something similar, we still love it. Roberts has the ability, after several dozen novels, to still weave the perfect tale of suspense, romance and this time a little of the paranormal to boot. I really enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to those who enjoy paranormal romances. I will say that I wouldn't consider this a good stand alone novel, not that you can't figure out what is going on but that it makes it more enjoyable to see the culmination of the storyline.

If you want an album that will help you escape the "hustle and bustle" of the world, this is the album for you. Similar to Jill Scott and Maxwell, Corrine's music will transport you to another world. I, for one, commute a total of 30 minutes to an hour a day,and I have found that if I put this album in the player, I can relax and I am less uptight and frustrated when I get home. And finally, her unique voice has is reminiscent of some of the best jazz, blue and neo soul artists. And of course "Enchantment" is my favorite!

I guess that the reason that I enjoyed the book the most is because I am in law enforcement (a Cold Case Squad to boot) and it is a relatively accurate portrayal of how cold cases are investigated. I also must say that I have read the Lincoln Lawyer by Connelly, but none of his novels involving Bosch. I enjoyed it immensely.Harry Bosch has come out of retirement to join his old partner, Kizman Rider to solve a case. Now a member of the open-unsolved unit, Bosch sets out to solve how killed Rebecca Verloren, a bi-racial girl killed 17 years earlier. All they have is a cold hit (CODIS)and a name. It would seem that a group of skinheads and racist may be responsible for her death. Now the hard part begins, actually investigating the case and making the arrest. As the story unravels, we learn about police politics, animosity amongst officers, and a host of interesting facts about life within the department. We also learn how the death of a child can destroy a family. It would appear that Rebecca's family did not have enough to deal with loving each other during a time when interracial relationships were difficult, but having a daughter die only to find that she kept secrets. The father, once a successful restaurateur, now cooks for the homeless after becoming an alcoholic. The mother has become a recluse, lives with several cats, and maintains her daughter's room as she left it. I have found personally when investigating cold cases that you do find family members frozen in time and life because there was no "closure". So I know how Rider and Bosch feel coming years later to give a family hope that something is going to happen to resolve all of their guilt and anger. This is an awesome responsibility and task, and I thought that Connelly wrote it well. But what was most interesting about the novel and the case was just how everything is not what it seems. I wasn't necessarily shocked at the end when the killer is revealed, but I know how investigators can have one idea about a case and follow it, only to find out that they have the wrong idea. I enjoyed this Connelly novel and intend to read the next one.

An off-duty cop has been killed in Roarke's Club, Purgatory, and as Eve unravels the mystery, not only does she find bad cops, but one of Roarke's oldest and deadliest enemies, Max Ricker. Ricker wants to destroy Roarke and what better way then using Eve. And as the story unfolds, the body count rises as more cops turn up dead, but why? Is it a vendetta or something more sinister? You won't be necessarily surprised, but you will love the character and plot development.On top of everything else, while trying to solve the murder, Eve begins to have memories about her childhood, and realizes that Max Ricker has ties to her disturbing past. She is extremely surprised to find that Roarke's oldest enemy probably knew what her father was doing to her in Dallas, and made no attempts to stop him. (In later installments, you find that Roarke and Eve's lives were intertwined long before they met, since childhood. Both of their fathers knew each other and were involved in criminal enterprises. So, it would seem that Roarke and Eve were destined to be together.)In summary, I think this novel is one of my favorites in the series. Not only did we see Roarke "lose his cool", but we get to see how he feels about the appearance of Eve's past lover, Webster (an internal affairs detective who appears to know more than he is willing to say). I think it was nice to see Roarke "off stride" for a change. I will also say that one disadvantage for me is that I am not reading the series in order, so I am not sure if what I am about to say is relevant. What I would have like to read is a story about how Ricker's son (who was mentioned a lot) handles the fact that Eve and Roarke stopped his lunatic father? I think that would be a wonderful story and an interesting villian in a future story.

Baltimore Herald Reporter Darryl Billups is having quite the week.....he has broken up with his live-in girlfriend (humorous scene involving a roach and a sarcastic sister); had his house firebombed; the tires of his car slashed and stumbled into a mouth-watering story that will set Baltimore well....on fire. When someone forgets to pay their storage rental, the belongings are sold and the new owner discovers the mummified corpse of a female. The stakes become even higher when several people are ambushed and killed at the storage facility immediately following the discovery. Darryl, always up for the challenge of the next big story, uses his investigative skills to identity the woman and solve the murder. Soon he is plagued by a series of accidents that are either related to his personal life or meant to divert his efforts from solving the investigation. "Don't Believe your lying Eyes" is quite the roller coaster ride! There was a missing corpse, entertaining dialogue between characters, some humor, kidnappings and various other deeds to cover-up what happened over 18 years ago (to a well known jazz singer, Adrienne) and protect the identity of her killer.This was my first Blair Walker novel and I enjoyed it. I thought the plot was fast moving, and the protagonist was mildly entertaining. My only criticism would be that there were some plot twists that I would have liked to have been fleshed out a little more, but overall, I was satisfied with the end result.

I'm kind of torn when it comes to this novel by some great, female, suspense writers. First, it had everything that it needed to be great (JD Robb being one of them, and one of my favorites)...meaning wonderful, talented writers and a decent plot. But what it lacked was some details that I thought would have made it great (because there were several writers, who although great, wrote from their perspective, so when the murderer is finally revealed, it seems kind of off). The ending seemed, in my opinion, rushed.The plot was good, murder at the spa. Caroline, a newly married woman (to a Congressman no doubt) has come to Phoenix Spa (a spa for the wealthy) to bond with her mother, Hilda (a cold and calculating character). While at the spa, she meets a number of highly influential and famous guests, among them a top fashion model and her agent; an old rock star, King David; a has-been producer; an actress; a psychic to the stars, and a sexy pool boy who isn't what he seems. They have all been invited to the spa and the owner, Claudia has been murdered. They are all suspects because it turns out that they all had motive, which is of course linked to blackmail and betrayal. As the story is told (each chapter by a different writer) the plots and subplots are exposed. By the end of the novel, I was kind of tired of the main character, Caroline and her plight, because her character was not as developed as I think it would have been had just one writer written it. You no longer cared that she was an ex-celloist, who felt betrayed by her cheating husband (or is he a cheater but someone trying to keep his secrets from his wife), and frankly you were tired of her whining. I wanted so badly for her to be involved in solving the mystery, but she wasn't. She was merely a character who was always around to see or hear things, but never really got involved. And even the detective, who I loved and some writers must have loved him also, was throughout the book, and yet at the end, he fell flat.I definately would suggest that you read this novel, but was it a 5, no...but if you love the writers who were invovled in writing the book, you won't want to miss out of it. At least check it out at the local library.

First I must say that I had seen this book and even picked it up several times in the store, only to put it back down. I don't know, I think it was the cover that made me question it's appeal. However, I finally said, what the heck...I have nothing to loose, I can always put it down. Well, you can imagine my surprise when I found myself flipping page after page, and transporting myself to a small part of the world, Natchez MS. I had never heard of the author Greg Iles and this was my first introduction to his work. I really enjoyed it. The opening pages draw you into a story that promises more.The story was simple, and although there were startling revelations, it was not hard to follow. Penn Cage, attorney/novelist/widow returned to his hometown following a sensational trial and victory, to raise his daugher in a small town wholesome environment. Penn sits on the school board of his old school with his good friend/doctor/Golden Boy Drew Elliott. There is even mention of Drew saving Penn's life when they were young, and they have been friends ever since. From all appearances, Drew and Penn have it all. They are wonderfully successful, have great reputations, wonderful children and are the movers and shakers in the town. They have it all...one would think until one event spins both of their lives out of control,,,the rape/murder of a "pregnant" Kate Townsend. Kate is the beautiful, valedictorian who was scheduled to attend Harvard. From her death, we learn that Drew has done the unthinkable, he has been carrying on an affair with his 17 year old babysitter, Kate, who he intended to leave Natchez and be with until her untimely demise. He, he confides is trapped in a marriage with a woman who is addicted to painkillers, and the only thing keeping them together is his son. Through a series of twists and turns, the readers finds Drew and Penn facing armed blackmailers, and fighting for their lives (Penn's from a crazed drug dealer and Drew, who is tried for capital murder, where the sentence could be death).There are a host of complicated characters: Mia Burke (Penn's babysitter who he finds himself attracted to but not willing to cross the line. She is also the amateur sleuth who helps him eventually unravel the case. She is also Kate's rival,in love and school.); Sunny (a bitter, racist cop, whose own ambitions will eventually be his downfall); Shad Johnson (the Black District Attorney who has political ambitions to be Mayor); Cyrus (ex-military/drug dealer/obsessed with Kate); Marco (a drug dealer/war refuge who sees life through the terrifying eyes of a child who saw and experienced too much); Kaitlin (Penn's girlfriend who doesn't like small town living) and several others.There were some parts in the story that I would have liked to know more about, but overall, this novel had everything for a successful story. Natchez, although it appears small and quiet (25,000 residents and dropping) is a hot-bed of secrets and desires. You eventually learn that there are sexual exploits (among teens and adults), forbidden love triangles, drugs, racial tension, blackmail plots,and death. Everything is not what it seems.I really enjoyed this novel, and know that you will too.

I loved The Women of Brewster Place. I thought that Gloria Naylor did a wonderful job introducing a host of characters, that we all grew to love. We learn how each character's secrets have driven them to the same location....Brewster Place. We have a mother who loved too much. A lesbian who moved from place to place to find acceptance. A drunk who misses his daughter. A wealthy girl who is stuggling for acceptance on her own terms. A neighbor who is too busy being a busy body to accept. A woman who looses her daughter to an accident that leaves her reeling. We learn about all of their loves, fears, and heartaches.I think Naylor does a wonderful job at setting the tone that "something" has to change in each of their lives and creates an atmosphere that you know change is coming. This powerful novel ends with the tearing down of the walls that hold its residents hostage, both figuratively and literally.

I first became a fan of Sebold when I read "The Lovely Bones"...so I sought out "Lucky" with the hopes of finding another jewel in a sea of bad literature. When I skimmed the back cover to determine what it was about, I was surprised to find that it was an autobiography of her brutal rape while she attended Syracuse University. I was inspired to see how someone could write about something so tragic and personal, and soon learned that while she discussed her eventual travel through drug addiction and alcoholism. We see the rape through the trial, and the subsequent effects of these events as they relate to her life. However, the overwhelming theme throughout the novel is SURVIVAL and forgiveness.

While navigating city traffic, I drink my one and only cup of coffee for the day. It makes the anger and resentment of driving in heavy traffic manageable. So I have made it my mission to collect great travel mugs. Believe it or not, they are hard to find. Or at least those that have the features that I would like are difficult to find. I would like a travel mug that will keep the coffee hot (for at least two hours), protect me from spills and is attractive. (You can tell I am easy to please....hot and spill proof!) So, when I had to select three things that I wanted for Christmas from my Secret Santa, a travel coffee mug was at the top of my list. Guess what! I received the Contigo! It is fabulous. My coffee stays hot, and it will not spill because of the spill proof opening (your hand must grip the release in order have the contents come out). I even knocked it over and was amazed when nothing dripped. I simply love it and am already planning on gifting this item to other coffee lovers that I know.

I really enjoyed Industrial Magic, because it is a continuation in the series. Although the first two novels centered around the werewolves, this one expands into the area of ghost, necromancers, and vampires. There is a reintroduction to old characters and an introduction to new ones. I can't wait to see where the series goes now.In this the 4th novel, we see Paige and Lucus coming to grips with there love and the supernatural worlds feelings about their growing relationship and love. Meanwhile, there is a killer out there who is "killing" the offspring of the Cabal family. There is a lot of excitement, passion and magic. Can't wait for the next installment. I would recommend that you read it. I finished it in two days and could not put it down.

Cassie Palmer has been on the run for some time from the vampire (Mafia like Tony) who killed her parents and adopted her to gain or use her clairvoyant powers. Escaping from one situation after another, Cassie learns that everyone isn't what they appear. Gaining new powers (that she is reluctant to accept and barely understands), Cassie finds out that the supernatural world is not for the faint of heart. As dark and light forces, the Senate, the Council, and other deadly foe struggle for control over Cassie, we are introduced to a world where weres, satyrs, mages, witches and vampires, are all vying for the ultimate power that will allow them to rule the supernatural world. Is she merely a pawn to gain control or does she truly weld true power?From my brief description, I am sure you think that I enjoyed the story, but NOT really. There was nothing really new about this paranormal tale. There is a woman with paranormal powers (some of which are still evolving) that everyone wants, who also is in lust with a sexy, dangerous vampire or two. (This of course reminds me of Hamilton's Anita Blake series which I don't really care for.) And while I enjoy, LA Banks, Kelley Armstrong, and Sherrilyn Kenyon (other authors in the paranormal arena), this reminded me of Hamilton minus the orgies to gain the power (which I fear may be next). Anyway, the entire story is setting up future novels, and while some of it was interesting, it took way too long to get to the point (which I am not sure it ever did before its abrupt conclusion). There were some scenes that could have been shortened and still the reader would have gotten the point. And while I somewhat enjoyed hearing about the woman with the outfit made of living snakes; the mage who had an arsenal of weapons (Pritkin); and Cassie's sizzling wards; and some hot vamps (Tomas and Mircea), it was not enough there to make me run out and get the entire series and "devour" it. So with that said, I am not so sure that I would read another Chance novel unless someone could assure me that they have improved.

There was Blade and then there was Buffy. Two loves in totally different styles! One of my favorite authors of all times is LA Banks of the Vampire Huntress Series. If I had to make a comparison, and the only reason that I am is because I am trying to compare this work with some of the other outstanding authors in the paranormal romance genre. Meyer is unlike other paranormal romance writers (like Handeland, Armstrong and Banks) in that her work is campy and light, and would kind of remind you of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, without the slaying! Handeland, Armstrong and Banks' works are more like Blade or Underworld, full of fights, a little sex, a lot of action and adventure (for a more mature audience). However, although I am in my late 30's, I found that "Twilight" to be a wonderful story with a lot of future potential, so much so that I am driven to read the others.Briefly, the plot: Bella moves to Forks to live with her father, Charlie (who I would love to see really more involved in the storyline in future novels). The clumsy, insecure and awkward teenager enters a new high school and finds that while she was a small fish in a big ocean (in the City), here in Forks she seems exciting to the locals (lots of boys interested). However, while several boys find Bella interesting, there is only one that catches her eye, Edward Cullen. Edward, who initially seems to dislike Bella, proves to be a puzzle to her. He is mysterious, extremely handsome and doesn't come to school when the sun is shining (Forks is normally rainy and cloudy). As she sets out to solve the mystery of Edward, she begins to discover that the Cullen family is not what they seem. Besides being all extremely beautiful, they appear to have a lot of secrets.So, while Bella works on solving the mystery to her mysterious boyfriend and his family, she is also dealing with the normal perils of teenage life: boys, relationships, dances, proms, divorced parents and clumsiness (she gets hurt all the time).What I liked about the novel was the tension between her desire to be with Edward forever, and his reluctance to make sure that she remains human. While he has lived 80 years, she is only 17 or 18. (OK, that could bring on a totally different conversation.) He feels that stealing her soul, would amount to fighting all that he and his family have been working for (they have given up human blood and only hunt animals) for the past few decades. Who will ultimately win this battle of wills is what we will have to stay tuned in to see?I can't wait to read New Moon, hopefully it will live up to my expectations.

I have grown to love most of Sherrilyn Kenyon's work, however, I felt at times that she was trying "a little too hard". There were times when she just seemed to be going through the motions. It wasn't that this book of short stories (One Bad Night,Bad to the Bone and Captivated by You)were horrible, they just seemed to lack something..maybe they were too short. However, the one saving grace is the continuing story of Tee and Joe, who evetually have to get together if for no other reasons than the fans. But if you would like a quick read, with some entertaining sex scenes, read Born to be Bad.

Sebastian Donovan is a psychic who loves and believes in family. He also believes in using his psychic gifts to help others. Having recently returned from assisting law enforcement to solve a series of heinous murders, he is reluctant to assist on another case that could drain him both physically and emotionally. So when he is approached by a desperate mother (Rose) who is devastated about the kidnapping of her child (David), Sebastian isn't sure that he wants to become involved. Especially if it means that he has to partner with a very skeptical ex-cop turned Private Investigator Mel, who doesn't believe in psychics or premonitions. While this proves initially to be quite the challenge, it is also extremely rewarding because romance and love bloom in both of their hearts. As the two solve the mystery of who stole David and why, they find love and grow to love those qualities in each other that make them special.I thoroughly enjoyed Entranced and look forward to reading the final installation in the trilogy. Maybe I just really liked Sebastian...because he reminded me of Roarke in the In Death Series, with the hint of Ireland in his voice, sexy, and 6'4, or maybe I just really liked Mel (AKA Mary Ellen Sutherland), the strong female character in Entranced who could have been Eve Dallas' twin after all she has short hair, a dent in her chin, and an attitude. Or maybe it was because I saw the two falling head over hills in love and wanted to go along for the wonderful ride. Entrances, with just the right amount of romance, intrigue and a little paranormal twist to boot.

I absolutely love Grey's Anatomy. I tell people all the time that what is so refreshing about this "medical" drama is that characters are "very" real people, most of which can be found in our families or lives. The writer of the show has found the perfect ingredients for success....a wonderful cast of characters (none of them are toooooo perfect..LOL. Just flawed enough to make them believable), a wonderful storyline and seemingly endless amounts of new material. It is better than ER in its prime.The story seems to center around Meredith Grey, an intense, lonely, resident who is broken emotionally by a series of events outside of her control (I think her parents divorce, her mother's illness, and a sex life that consists of meeting strangers in bars and taking them home). But while the story is about her, it is her interaction with a host of other characters that really makes the show good. The show opens with Meredith rushing to work after spending the night with a guy she met in a bar. Guess what, when she arrives to work, she finds that her new boss is none other than Dr. Shepherd, otherwise known as "McDreamy". Over the course of the show, we find that Dr. Shepherd is living and dealing with demons of his own. There are also her roommates, George (who is hopelessly in love with Meredith) and Izzy (the pretty girl who paid her way through medical school by modeling). There are friends Christina (a perfectionist), and an egotistical resident who would rather be nasty than nice. There are other people at the hospital, the Chief, Burke (a perfectionist with a heart), and Bailey (who everyone calls the Nazi). Grey's Anatomy is only getting better and I can not wait until the next season is available.

Arthur Bishop (played by sexy Jason Statham), an extremely organized assassin has decided to take on an apprentice, Steve McKenna (played by Ben Foster) following the death (at his hands) of his mentor/friend (played by the talented Donald Sutherland). Trying to instill patience and control in his new assistant, Bishop sets out to teach him the ropes (basically how to kill someone and escape notice). Engaging and entertaining, this movie was chopped full of great fight scenes, great action, and a decent story line. "The Mechanic" was well worth the $1 that I paid to rent it. I highly recommend it.

I really enjoyed this movie....I mean what is there not to like. You have a hitman (the sexy #47) who has been trained from childhood to be the best at what he does. Trained to hold his breath, shoot anything that moves from any distance, armed with sexy weapons and a barcode (tattooed beautifully in his scalp), along with an air of calm (that would make anyone scared who he faces), he is the perfect killing machine and running for his life. Determined to protect Nika, a prostitute to the President of Russia, from who else (her lover), #47 goes about the task of fighting the bad guys and righting what he thinks are wrongs. With a Interpol Cop on his heels, he attempts to uncover the truth about why someone he thought he killed wants him dead and what the whole thing is about. I enjoyed this movie...with its cool fight scenes and nice special effects. It was definitely worth renting on a Sunday afternoon.

The plot is this simple....roommates go home to study/visit. There is a happy family that is excited that their daughter is home with a friend. There is a well loved cute little kid and a seemingly happily married couple. And there is a "truck driving mad man" who comes into the house and kills everyone, takes one roommate hostage with the other following to help with the big escape. There are several other murders and great chase scenes, and lots of twists and turns in this movie, but you should be able to guess the ending way before it happens. My only criticism is that I really didn't like the dubbing, at times it made the movie a little low budget and hokey. But if you like scary movies, you will enjoy it, you just have to ignore the dubbing!

Darcy, the last of the Gallagher clan, wants only to find a husband who can afford to give her the lifestyle that she desires...wealth, comfort and material things. These are things that she dreams of while helping her two brothers run Gallaghers, the neighborhood bar. And while she seems superficial and flighty, underneath it all she truly loves her family and will do anything for her two newly married brothers, Shawn and Aidan. So when she meets her match in the form of Trevor Magee she realizes that her heart may be at risk of being broken. Wanting merely to discover his roots, Trevor has traveled to Ardmore to build a theater, something that will tie him to the country where his family originated from. The last thing he expects to find is a beautiful, talented woman who he desires. He wants her voice (for his company Celtic Records), and her body, so if offering her the material things she wants is all he has to do, he will do it. Just as he sets out to wheel and deal in the business world, he sets out to strategize and get what he wants most....Darcy. Meanwhile, Carrick, Prince of the Fae, is still pining for Gwen in hopes that the two will move beyond their stubbornness to realize that they are destined to be with each other, thus breaking the curse.It was fitting that Darcy's story was the last and the best. As saucy Darcy experiences real romance and passion, we see her yearning for something real.....surprisingly love. I loved seeing the shrew tamed. I also enjoyed catching up with Aidan (who is now an expectant father), Jude (whose book has just been published), Shawn (who is still the sweet, loveable musician/chef, and Brenna (the hard working contractor). Seeing the three find love and knowing that Carrick is finally happy and with the one he loves, was a joy I definitely recommend this book to those who love Nora Robert's trilogies with tons of romance and fun.

Maybe it's me but I can't get enough of this series. I know, I know....how many times can Alice (AKA Milla Jovovich) come back to stop the dastardly corporation known as Umbrella, which started the whole Zombie mess in the first place? And maybe it was just me, but I thought that this was the best one by far. Why....well, let me start with a brief synopsis of the movie.Alice tries to stop the leader of Umbrella (Wesler) by attacking him with several of her clones. After a showdown or all showdowns, it appears that she has been made human again (stripped of her supernatural powers) and she travels to what she thinks is salvation only to find a "mind altered" Claire who remembers nothing since they separated in the last movie. Following the clues where they go, they find a group of survivors who are living in an abandoned prison. Ironically, in the basement of the facility, in a cage, is Claire's brother who claims to know a way out of the prison. Of course it is not long before the mindless, yet ever hungry Zombies find a way into the facility and the survivors are running for their lives. Who will survive and who won't? That's for you to watch the movie and find out.What I liked about Resident Evil? Well, there were new characters, among them the sexy Wentworth Miller (Claire's brother) and Boris Kojoe (Luther West, an athlete). Maybe they were not new, but for someone who knows nothing about the video game or the story line that evolved from it, I was happy to see some newly introduced central characters. I also thought that they were brilliantly cast in their roles and brought an authenticity to their roles that I was surprised to see. I even liked the guy who played Wesler and thought that he brought a ruthlessness to the part that some may not have. There was even a gigantic executioner who appeared in the middle of the movie that was determined to kill them. He was awesome. And finally, there were wonderful special effects and several fight scenes that made the movie exciting and suspenseful at the same time. Not to mention a cliffhanger that will send lovers of the series to the movies in droves if there is another sequel. Whatever the formula, the creators of Resident Evil still have that winning formula that made the mindless Zombies theme work. I enjoyed it and would recommend it!

**May contain some spoilers.**Plot: A young electrician needs cash to help his family. As the medical bills pile up, Vince (AKA #13), played by Sam Riley, believes that stealing a man's identity (one who overdoses) and attending an event that will pay him millions, is the only solution to his problems. As he sets out to discover what the dead guy was willing to do to make money, Vince finds himself entrenched in a world that he never imagined. His number (aptly #13) is symbolic of his journey. What is he willing to risk to win the ultimate prize?What worked:(1) The concept behind the movie. While I did not know that this was a remake, I liked the underlying theme that there are some in our society (in this case the rich and privileged) who look to other venues to entertain themselves even if it is this version of a barbaric and meaningless sport (this version of Russian Roulette. So it is no surprise when Vince finds himself involved in a game of life or death. Participants must stand in a circle, load their weapons (with one bullet), spin the chamber and pull the trigger (which is pointing at the head of a fellow contestant). As the bodies fall, the number of bullets are increased and the suspense mounts. Who will be the last man standing. This movie definitely makes you evaluate human nature and reminded me of some of those movies I have seen in the past (with a similar premise) where actual humans (instead of animals) are being hunted for sport and entertainment. You ponder the issue of how would the prospect of winning tons of money weigh in your mind when considering the cost of a human life, even if it is yours. In the end would cold hard cash and the thrill of it all be more persuasive than your humanity and compassion. On the other hand, you may simply look at Vince's dilemma as he did and ask yourself what wouldn't you do for your family?(2) The imagery and tone. What else could symbolize the issue more than have this "Russian Roulette Club" meeting in an old mansion? Men risking their lives while surrounded with the trappings of wealth, something they all desire. And in the mist of all that wealth (men dressed to the nines and an opulent setting), there is still a dark underbelly....signified by the single light bulb with the spider drawn on it, and the undercurrent of betrayal and perhaps even simply madness. I simply loved the dark atmosphere and pulp noir/crime noir feel of the movie. It offered foreboding and sense of gloom that settled on the story like a second skin.(3) The symbolism. Not only is the entire movie symbolic, but the participant Vince (AKA #13) is as well. While most people fear that the number 13 is bad luck, you cheer and hope that it will be the opposite for Vince.(4) The cast. There were some pretty decent actors in the movie. The problem is that they never really peaked, although that may be just the point. They were all good, but none of them you really invested in with the exception of maybe the main character, Sam Riley (#13). You cheered for him and hoped that it would all end well.What didn't necessarily work:(1)While the cast was stuffed full of talent (the sexy Alexander Skargard, the talented Mickey Rourke, the brooding Jason Statham, the calculating Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson), none of them stood out in the crowd. Most were in the same roles that they always play, so really you did not form an attachment with any of them. Watching them in this movie was like watching in others during their career: Skargard from True Blood broods in a sexy way; "50 Cents" comes across as the sophisticated hoodlum; Rourke manages to always seem reckless, fearless and daring. To be honest, there were no real standouts with the exception of Riley, and maybe that was because he was an unknown to me. I have never seen him in a film that I can remember. So his innocence and sincerity made him endearing and likeable. Otherwise, I thought that the actors, with some additional material could have really shined even those who were acting in supporting roles.(2) And finally there was something missing. I can't put my hand on it, but something was lacking. Maybe because I was expecting a little "more" when I saw the actors involved, and read the plot, but it didn't deliver. I mean in terms of surprises or unresolved issues there were none. It was pretty cut and dry. And while this isn't always a bad thing, I wanted a little more and even found myself (when the movie was fading into black) asking myself was that it?Overall "13" was a solid 3. There was a captivating premise, some decent actors and decent imagery. And while there was "something" missing (and I can't figure out what it is), I don't regret the almost 2 hours I spent viewing of it. It was decent for a Sunday afternoon.

3.5 to 4A crew of thieves plan one of their biggest scores to date, worth millions. Ghost (played by TI), an ex-crew member, has returned after being released from prison, with a plan that seems to be too good to be true. Telling them he can be trusted (after all he never spilled the beans), he informs his old crew that he is willing to let hard feelings go if they simply help him beat the Russians to the heist of a lifetime. While extremely organized and technically savvy, the group devises a plan (in a relatively short time) to beat the Russians to the punch, although they are not sure they should trust Ghost. Perhaps compelled by greed they proceed with their plans to pull off the biggest heist of their careers. The adrenalin and complexity of the plan proves challenging to all involved.There are interesting characters ...... Ghost (played by TI) has lost everything from his woman (played by Zoe Saldana) to his freedom. Gordon Cozier (Idris Elba) is not only concerned about Ghost's return and making money, but has a sister (who is heavily addicted to crack) that he is putting thru rehab. John (played by Paul Walker), Gordon's closest ally, is very reluctant to trust their newly returned crew member but goes with the flow. Jake (Michael Ealy) definitely has a reason to fear Ghost's intentions because he is now engaged to TI's ex, the very sultry Lilly (Zoe Saldana) and thinks its all too convenient. Jesse (Chris Brown), perhaps the youngest crew member, is a rookie whose arrogance leads to some rookie mistakes. Perhaps one of the most overlooked characters, in my opinion was AJ (Hayden Christensen), who surprised you with his cunning and expert fighting and technology skills. Then there is also a devoted, slighted obsessive Detective (Matt Dillon) who has neglected everything because of his job, losing his wife and straining his relationship with his daughter. Not to mention his partner, Eddie (Jay Hernandez) who realizes how precious time with a child can be, especially since his son is suffering from an illness that he would do anything for. The cast of characters work well with each other and are believable in their roles.SPOILER....My biggest complaint was that while entertaining, it was unfortunately predictable. I mean what did they expect......why would they even trust a man who spent time in jail, never told on his crew but knew that they were going on with their lives? Ghost stewed over the fact that not only was he shot during their last heist, but that the crew left without trying to save him. Couple that with his woman not waiting for him (taking up with another crew member), his money hidden and finally being pissed off. Would you really trust him and include him in your plans?? NO. If it had been me, I would have paid him off and cut all ties. Once someone feels betrayed, there is no stopping him from getting revenge, especially if he can get rid of two enemies (or more) at once. So to me, that was unrealistic, unless you believe that pure greed would prevent most from using their commonsense.So while I would say the story is predictable, I didn't mind the journey that resulted in an action packed, fast moving and satisfying conclusion.

Elena Estes (who I recognize as a character from a previous novel) is back and better than ever. Investigating the death of a co-worker and friend, Elena soon discovers that events from her past, are effecting her present and future. More than anything, Elena wants to solve Irina's death, and having recently broken up with her lover, Detective Landry, she struggles to keep him at arms length while assisting in the investigation. I will not retell the story, or tell you who killed Irina and why (enough reviewers have done that), but I will make a few simple statements. This novel contains everything that you need to make a terrific suspense novel. There were wealthy men (Brody and a host of other interesting characters) who have formed an "Alibi Club" (a bad version of a Good Ole Boy Club, who provide alibis to each other if needed); sexy polo stars (Barbaro)looking for redemption; a grieving and vicious Russian Mobster, Alexi Kulak; a person referred to as a "Freak" (who walks around looking like a circus reject); blackmailers; a victim who is more than she seemed; and a murderer. But what I found to be the most compelling was the character of Elena. You really grow to understand why she has become so jaded, so filled with guilt, and so sad. We understand why she pushes Landry away, but secretly desires what they could have, but what she is too afraid of. Anyway, Elena is a product of her past. We find out that she has left the police force, 3 years ago, because of guilt that she has about causing the death of her partner during a meth bust. The incident left her with physical (she was drug by a truck) and psychological scars (blames herself). And on top of that, her ex-lover/fiance', Bennett Walker (20 years ago), appears to be the number one suspect. Elena remembers all too well how Bennett asked her to be his alibi when he was accused of raping and assaulting a girl, and would it be unreasonable to think that someone who has everything would not kill to protect themselves. And on top of that, he is a member of the Alibi Club. Having escaped punishment for his past deeds, with the help of her estranged/defense attorney father, Elena would like to see him brought to justice if he is guilty.As the story develops, you learn a lot about Irina, her lovers and her good friend Lizbeth, but you learn even more about Elena, and what makes her what she is....a truth seeker. How all of the injustices she has been a witness to, have shaped who she has become. I would love to read another Elena Estes story to see how her life evolves and what becomes of her relationship with Landry. So, I can tell you with no hesitation to read Alibi Man, I think you will enjoy it.

Ok, so this movie wasn't extremely original. There was nothing new or terribly exciting. Nerdy boy likes beautiful girl. Beautiful girl invites nerdy boy and other friends (from college, Tulane) to her lake home that she hasn't visited in 3 years. Beautiful girl's ex-boyfriend (Dennis) is a jerk and hangs out with a bigger jerk (Red). Beautiful girl and ex-boyfriend have a past that prevented her from coming home. There are some sharks (all varieties and all sizes) living in the salt water lakes surrounding her property (in the bayou). Neither the beautiful girl or her friends (Sara, Nick, Malik, Maya, Blake or Beth), no matter how smart or savvy they are, seem to be aware of the danger they are in from these hungry predators. Of course we should already know from the cookie-cut formula that exists in these types of movies, that as the body count rises, there will be the usual events...for example, when you are in danger there will be no reception or cell service; you will trust someone that you shouldn't; and there will be a bad guy or guys (who should be obvious in this movie) who have some convoluted reasons for why they are doing what they are doing....who waste no time spelling it out for you while torturing someone; not to mention the never-ending hope that we have that someone will survive. Personally I took this movie for what it was...mindless entertainment with some attempts at gore. While I didn't see the 3D version, and don't understand why there was one even made, I was entertained. While the plot loosely reminded me of other movies that involve murder-for-sport (Predator, Death Race, etc.) and animal gone bad movies (like Piranha, Jaws, Orca Killer Whale, etc), Shark Night was just plain fun. What more could you ask for, bad acting, an ok plot and decent (although there were some scenes that looked really computer generated) special effects? I give it a 3 for just the fun of it.

I am a little torn about this book, and not for the reason that most were. I did not have a problem with Shori being or looking like an 11 year old child, but still having men be sexually attracted to her (isn't that part of the allure of a vampire. And it reminded me of Anne Rice, pre saved, and Interview with a Vampire, there was a child vampire in that story too.). Any way, I think Mrs. Butler did an excellent job explaining her appearance and her allure/senuality. So I won't discuss that issue anymore because I think enough reviewers already have.My dilemma arises because I think (LOL) I enjoyed the first part of the book, more than the second....well, maybe not necessarily liked it better, but I think that it was easier to understand. It was a clearer story. The plot appeared to be simple. I think Butler spent a great deal of time building up the story about Shori and all of her symbionts only to kind of gloss over the topic later. I mean she did emphasize how they are necessary for her survival, but they were not critical in the story towards the end, except for the fact that some Ina do not care or love their symbionts, but use them for their own end. I know that I am not explaining this well, and it is difficult to explain. Be warned, this is how the book will leave you...kind of dazed and confused. (LOL) And some issues were carefully laid out and never resolved. Maybe it would be easier to critique if I go through a few things...The novel began with Shori, who appears to be an African American child (of about 11) awakening in a cave. She has been burned, left blind and suffers from severe head injuries, that has left her with no memory. After killing and eating a man, and several deer, she begins to look for others to help her discover who and what she is (although you can guess it, she is a form of a vampire). Along comes Wright, a man in his 20's who is immediately draen to and confused by her allure (afterall, should he be sexually attracted to a child). He takes her in, and protects her. It soon becomes clear to the readers that Shori is an "Ina" (similar to a vampire in that it feeds or takes blood from humans.....known as symbionts).To make a long story short, Shori has been genetically engineered to do things that other Ina's can not do. She can stay awake during the day and walk in the sun (she has darker skin than most Ina, who are pale with blond hair). And she soon learns that the reason both of her families have been killed is because of it. Someone doesn't like the fact that her Ina blood has been diluted with African American or even human blood.So in conclusion, the first part of the novel dealt with Shori discovering who and what she is, while the second part of the novel dealt with her attackers and the trial that followed. There is a trial that seeks the truth behind why the wrongs were done to her family. This part of the novel was filled with explanations of the Ina and their ways (i.e., mating habits, language, history and customs), but it was missing something. However, the overall theme appeared to be that there are just as many bigots in the Ina race, as the human race. And while the Ina feel that they are so evolved (better than humans), they have the same prejudices that we do. (That is what was the most interesting.)So, in conclusion (because I think this is the first review that I have written that appears to be rambling, like my mind after this book)....did I like the novel, yes. Would I read a sequel if there was going to be one...probably (but unfortunately Mrs. Butler died) just to see what happens to Shori, Wright, Brooke, Joel and Celia. But did I love it....No. Is it worth reading...yes.

Whether you believe in vampires or not,is not important in this enjoyable read. This was my first Thurlo novel and I enjoyed it. Although at times I thought it was too long, with no action, but I did enjoy the storyline and plot.(Have you ever read a novel and just wanted to find out what was going to happen? That was what it was like at times when I was reading this novel.) It is a simple, yet at times, complicated plot.... A man (Stewart Tanner) is being held and experimented on by a secret government organization because he appears to have a sensitivity to light, extraordinary healing powers and strength. The people who are holding him "seem" to believe he is a vampire or at least believe that there is something worth risking their lives for to find out. You aren't sure who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Anyway, Mr. Tanner escapes during a power outage and goes on a murderous rampage to "payback" those that tormented him. Hawk (Leo Hawk aka Lee Nez aka half Navajo/half vampire) is on the case with his trusted partner and girlfriend (although no romance happened, with the exception of stolen glances) Diane Lopez. There are a few other surprises that I am not going to spoil for the reader, but I am interested enough to read another Thurlo novel.

For a few months, I had HBO and found myself soon hooked on True Blood. So when I no longer had access to my "drug of choice", I waited faithfully for the release of True Blood Season 2. When it was available, I rushed to devour the disks like a mad woman, and spent an entire weekend locked in my bedroom riveted.Bon Temps, Louisiana appears to be a hot bed for paranormal activity. There has been another death reported at Merlotte's (the voodoo priestess who gave Tara an exorcism is has been found with her heart removed), and everyone is a suspect, including those in the small Louisiana town who aren't exactly human. Bon Temps' citizens are not only human, but werewolves, shifters, demigods, vampires and other things that aren't to easy to label. Season 3 finds: Sookie still devoted to Bill (although there are times that I don't know why); Eric still brooding and sexy (yeah, I prefer bad boy Eric to Bill); Tara still looking for love (with her new hottie Eggs) and a place to belong; Maryann still shimmering and causing the town's folk to have orgies; Lafayette is still being held in Eric's basement unsure if he is lunch; Jason, still slow but sweet and looking for redemption, has joined a church who has raged war on Vampires; Sam Merlotte is still confused and pining for something he is sure he can never have; Godric, the Vampire Sheriff is being held captive by Church but finding a new lease on life that includes vampires and humans co-existing (he is now enlightened); Andy the town sheriff is drinking heavily, risking his reputation and career, looking for an explanation into the unusual deaths in his town; and Sweet, virginal Hoyt has found love in the newly turned vampire, Jessica.While Sookie travels to Texas to assist Eric and the vampires rescue Godric, Tara undergoes several changes as Maryann worms herself into her life. Between Sam's maker returning, meeting a fellow telepath, and fighting the Minister who is bent on a war against the Vamps, Sookie sets out to right all wrongs. As the storyline converges into a satisfying season conclusion, I realize that I will have to wait several months for season 3 to be released. Regardless, I can't wait to find out what is happening in Bon Temps and see how it all plays out. And while I have read a few of Charlaine Harris', I enjoy the television series more.

Nell Channing has escaped a privileged life and an abusive husband by faking her own death. Determined to start anew she travels to a small close knit community off the shore of Massachusetts, Three Sister Island, believed to have been forged by three witches. Determined to make a life for herself, Nell sets out to make Three Sisters her home. Upon arrival, she meets the beautiful and mysterious Mia Devlin, a bookstore owner (and a witch) who offers her a job (as a cook in the store) as well as a home. Before she knows it, she's part of the community and everyone is requesting her catering services. The only thing she did not anticipate was falling for the dashingly sexy Sheriff, Zack Todd. Sheriff Todd would like for Nell to confide in him and tell him what she is running from all while hoping that eventually she will be his forever. As the danger mounts, Nell must (1) learn how to handle her new found "supernatural talents" and (2) trust her new friends Mia Devlin (a witch who has accepted her gift), Ripley Todd (Zack's sister and sheriff who has not accepted her supernatural gifts), and Zack to overcome and face her past.I thought that this was a wonderful, easy to read story with just the right amount of romance, suspense and supernatural foreshadowing that any reader can enjoy. As usual, Roberts is dedicating each book to one of the witches which should prove for a very satisfying series. I enjoyed "Dance upon the Air" and can't wait to read the remaining two "Heaven & Earth" and "Face the Fire".

Soap star and hunk (Drake Rivington) + deaf daughter (Jennifer) + deceased wife/ballerina (Susan) + secrets + pretty "red headed" teacher (Lauri) = romance and love. That's about it. The secret I guessed early on, the romance was a given and the story is ok. You can read it about a day. It is not to heavy or hard to understand...something to take your mind off your troubles.

My 10-year-old son was mesmerized from the time the movie began until it ended. I too thought that the story was lighthearted and entertaining as well. We both had the simple desire to be entertained, on a Sunday afternoon and "Journey to the Center of the Earth" fit the bill.Sean, a young teen who has lived most of his life without the benefit of a father (an adventurer gone missing), is being forced to spend time with his uncle Trevor (his father's brother, a professor).While going thru several items belonging to his missing, yet presumed dead father, they discover a book that yields clues to his possible whereabouts and could unlock the mystery to a magical world. Jumping on a plane to follow the clues, Trevor and Sean try to build a relationship that they both can benefit from, while deciphering clues. As they arrive in Iceland, the adventure begins with the addition of a beautiful mountain guide Hannah, whose father and Trevor's brother were ultimately connected because of similar beliefs. As all three struggle to believe in the impossible, we are dazzled by glowing birds, amazing, waterslides, angry dinosaurs, large attacking Venus fly traps, and other moments of wonderful special effects."Journey to the Center of the Earth" is a wonderful family drama that had everything you could hope for. You had romance and comedy (uncle and nephew argued over who would get the girl), there were tender moments (when Trevor finds resolution to what happened to his brother 10 years earlier), and very entertaining special effects. So, if you want to watch an easy going, light adventure, this is the movie for you.

I don't regret reading it, because in general I enjoy the Hayle series, but this one left me feeling OK, not great I am ready to read it again...or I wonder what book will be next. For those who love Wesley, you will feel comfortable with Tamara's continued struggle to find love, keep her son happy and deal with the perils of living in an urban area plagued by crime and mystery. I think the familiar is what I did enjoy, although it amazes me how much she comes into contact with mayhem.

Angela (Angie) Toussaint has returned to her grandmother's home in Sacajawea, Washington to try and heal her failed marriage (to Tariq) and her disintegrating relationship with her son (Corey). But a 4th of July celebration turns into a nightmare when Corey takes his life with a gun that she thought long gone. Suffering from guilt and regret, Angela longs to make some sense of what happened in the cellar that fateful day. Returning years later, Angie unravels the mystery of who her grandmother was, and how the "magic" that she wielded in the past is effecting the present. She is doubly surprised when she learns that Grandma Marie was not the only one practicing magic, but Corey was too, shortly before his death. Their acts, and the evil they awakened (the baka) has set off a chain of events that will change Angela and this small town forever.This is Due at her best. There were tons of plots that once woven produced one of the spookiest stories that I have read in awhile. Reminiscent of Stephen King, or Brandon Massey, she effectively creates twists and turns that only make the story haunting and unforgettable. While "My Soul to Keep" remains my favorite, this is among the top 10. So, if you are a reader who enjoys suspense and just the right amount of horror, then this is definitely the read for you.

Catch .44 had everything that should have made this movie fabulous...there were great actors, and lots of action. The ever talented Bruce Willis gave a performance much as he often does in his sexy, understanded way; a chilling presence by Forest Whitaker; and some very interesting performances by Nikki Reed, Deborah Woll, and Malin Akerman. There was even great cinematography, and in what should have been a story told in a decent tone filled with suspense. It would kind of remind you of Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction, Grindhouse, Kill Bill, Dust to Dawn) or Rodriquez/Ethan Maniquis (Machete) works....with the flashbacks, twists and turns of suspense...but where their movies soar and come to life (leaving you craving, no wanting more), this one (directed by Harvey) fizzled or better yet, crashed and burned. I am not sure if it was the confusing twists and turns about double crossing drug dealing thieves or killers, or simply a plot missing real substance, but whatever it was, Catch .44 disappointed.

Barrow, a small Alaskan town experiences 30 days of darkness once a year. During this time, most residents leave for parts unknown, but some stay. With the appearance of a stranger in town (demanding raw meat), and darkness fast approaching, there is foreshadowing of very bad things to come. It soon becomes clearly evident that this small town is in deep trouble when the brave and dedicated Sheriff (played by Josh Hartnett) finds a hole filled with burned cell phones and the mutilated bodies of several snow dogs. While he struggles to discover the truth, he also has to deal with the fact that his estranged wife is stranded in town (after missing her flight), and that several people are dependant on him for their survival. As the death count increases, the remaining survivors band together to defeat the evil (seemingly crazed vampires) feeding on their town. With a secret language of their own, scary teeth and a very determined leader, the vampires intend to feed on everyone and everything in town before burning it to the ground. All the remaining citizens have to do is survive for 30 days in a town with no contact from the outside world, darkness, cold and several crazed vampires using every trick in the book to get them to surrender.What I did like about the movie was the imagery (snow, dark and dreary), the anticipation of daylight returning (I loved the whole daily countdown), and the looming presence of evil. And the final few moments of the movie were absolutely breathtaking.On the other hand, there were two things that I did not enjoy about the movie...namely, the slow moving build-up to the showdown and poor character development. For example, the methodical creation of anticipation at times took away from the overall flow of the movie. And because of the lack of character development concerning the additional survivors (having been told briefly about the Sheriff's troubled marriage, and seeing the son taking care of his Alzheimer suffering father) we never got to really know them and therefore did not really care about their fate.With all that said, I will say that this movie was definitely not the worse vampire flick that I have ever seen, it just could have been better.

Sunny Chandler has returned to her hometown to attend her best friend's wedding. Faced with a past of scandal, heartbreak and secrets, she is determined to maintain her cool, confident persona, and not give the gossips of the town more to talk about. Imagine her surprise when she encounters the dashing, sexy, confident Sheriff Ty Beaumont, the opposite of any man she has ever met, and who claims to have made a bet to "bed her before the end of the week".Most criticize the book for being "dated", but I realized that the book was written in the late 80's (note references Dynasty, Rambo, and Charles Bronson....and some of the, let's just say "dated" references that Ty makes) and that should explain it. However, I must warn you, there are some really funny parts in the story, that makes a woman in the 2007 laugh, but the datedness (if that is a word) makes it cute! However, keeping that in mind, if you like Sandra Brown, and you want to read something short and easy, where a confused, yet independent woman meets a take charge and slightly chivalrous and at times chauvinist guy, you will enjoy "Sunny Chandler's Return".

Gabby O'Callaghan (a sidhe-seer) can't believe it when she spots a "Fae" (the sexy, Tuatha De Danaan" Prince Adam Black) who has been cursed (by the Seelie Queen) to appear human (because he challenged her before her court). Realizing that only Gabby can see or hear him, he sets out to get her to help him (while winning her heart of course). Having been taught her whole life to fear the Fae, Gabby must learn to trust Adam, and with a deadly Fae on their trail, she doesn't have much time. And since Adam finds himself powerless (with only the power to move quickly), he must turn to those whose lives he saved in the past. On the run, the two travel to the Highlands in Scotland, where they learn to understand and love each other, while a traitor of the Queen gets closer to his goal (killing Adam and taking the thrown). And while Adam thought his biggest problem would be convincing the Queen of the truth, he soon realizes that in the end it is he that must choose between love, power and duty.Although I have read other Moning tales (Fever Series) this was my first Highlander tale and I enjoyed it. It was fast paced, funny and of course romantic. This combination made for a quick read. My only complaint, and it really wasn't a "major " complaint was that the show down between the good and bad guys was over too soon (anticlimactic) and should have lasted longer. But I suppose the wonderfully, romantic ending made up for it.

Poor, misguided, drunken Superhero Hancock, seems to have lost his way along with his memory. Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger. Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a "true" hero. With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience. The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit. After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?

3 perspectives3 reasonsGrier - LoveCheadle - HonorHawke - FamilyRichard Grier, a veteran cop, days from retiring is asked to train new officers. Disillusioned and bitter, Grier doesn't want to do more than he has to. Looking for love in all the wrong places (he is sleeping with a coke using prostitute), he seems like a drunk and lazy cop who really doesn't care about justice or policing anymore until he sees something he just can't let go. When the death of his ex-trainee pushes him to take a stand, we aren't surprised, nor are we encouraged.Cheadle is an ambitious undercover narcotics officer who has sacrificed and lost his wife to the job. Desperately wanting a promotion, Cheadle is willing to do anything including setting up his drug dealing friend (played by Wesley Snipes). As they struggle to maintain status in the drug community, things soon get wildly out of hand and a drug war is underway.Ethan Hawke plays a struggling drug officer who is just trying to make ends meet for his "ever growing" family. Hawke, feeling pressure to get a new house (because his wife has asthma and is having pregnancy complications related to mold), plans to do the unthinkable. And no, murdering drug dealers to buy your family a new house isn't a good enough reason to kill even if they aren't any loss to society.As the three officers converge in a semi-spectacular finale, we are not too surprised about their outcomes. Would I recommend this movie? Not really, there was nothing too original or different about the plot, no surprises. In essence, Cheadle, Grier and Hawke have played these characters before (or something close to it) and didn't do anything new with the roles, but what merits the 3 star rating was the fact that there were veteran actors who tried to do a decent job with what they had (a script that lacked luster). And while the film was dark and attempted to offer the gritty side of law enforcement (which I enjoy), I am not sure that this film delivered. So while the views of Love, Honor and Family appeared on the surface to be good reasons for the decisions they made, they didn't justify in my mind, their actions.

Ok, I will admit, I continue to give Patterson collaborations a chance although I will constantly complain about the ill conceived plots and unbelievable storylines. But, when I selected this one, I said that I am going to change my attitude and not hold the story up to my usual test of realism (concerning police procedures etc). I was going to be open minded and embrace the story for what it was...sheer entertainment. With that being said....I enjoyed listening to "Step on a Crack". It was extremely entertaining and the narrators (John Slattery & Reg Rogers) were great, bringing enthusiasm and danger to each exciting scene. You feel like you are at the romantic restaurant with the President and his wife; you are in the church with the hostages; and you are with Detective Michael Bennett as he says goodbye to his wife. Between the action, sound effects and the story, you are spellbound until the somewhat predictable end.Now about the story: The Ex-First Lady of the United States has been killed and the funeral of the century is being scheduled. Not only will it take place in the center of New York City, but there will be tons of dignitaries (politicians, actors and other celebrities) in attendance. So when the church comes under siege (by masked monks) Detective Michael Bennett is called to the scene. Still reeling from his wife's illness (she is terminally ill) and wondering how he can manage raising his large adopted family alone, he looks to his job to help him remain centered. However, these hijackers aren't following the play-book; they know all the tricks and don't follow the normal rules. They are in control at all times and know what they want (money and lots of it).Partial Spoilers listed below.....What I really, really liked about this story? Contrary to the usual (in some Patterson novels) I really liked the main character, Detective Bennett. I am not sure if it was: (1) the fact that his grandfather was so endearing, Irish brogue and all; or because (2) he was dealing with the fact that his wife was dying leaving him with a brood of adopted children, each that he loves unconditionally. Or it may have been how for once, the hero was just that... a hero. There were no over the top theatrics, no unbelievable show down, no ironic twists of fate, just a Detective who used good old fashioned deductive reasoning to solve a crime. Bennett evoked emotions of sympathetic while remaining extremely endearing and likeable. Your heart simply breaks for him every time you hear him speak about his wife. But you also know that he will survive even if his heart is broken.What I didn't necessarily like? Sometimes Patterson collaborations are so fantastical (remember I have let that go) and so over the top, that you moan constantly whenever something unbelievable occurs. There is also that predictable cookie cutter reveal of the bad guy, who you thought was a good guy, but is really the really bad guy formula.... that I always manage to guess. For example, in the Alex Cross series, Patterson always makes the killer someone within the main character's circle.....for Alex it is his good buddy, Kyle Craig. And usually the same formula holds true for most of the collaborations.....reflect on the books The Quickie, Beach Road, Beach House, etc. Whatever the plot, you know that the protagonist should look close to home if he is trying to determine who has betrayed him. I would for once like to be really surprised when the bag guy is revealed. And I am not sure that that will happen!Overall, I give "Step on a Crack" a 4. If for no other reason than the sweet and charismatic Detective Bennett. While the story was the usual, and the end a little bit anti-climatic (and ok, kind of corny...one thing said by one of the hostages leads Bennett to the truth, although I am sure if he just took his time, he would have eventually come up with the same conclusion that the reader did....), I enjoyed it. It was a quick and easy story with those short, easy to read (listen to) chapters.

I just love the "In Death" series by Robb, but what I loved more, in this installment was the underlying tension between Eve and Roarke. Most who love the series, and for those who have yet to become hooked, know that Eve and Roarke have a love so deep and pure, that at times we get swallowed up in their story. However, while I found the plot to be the normal "Eve's going to get the bad guys", and the normal appearance of those characters we love to love (Mavis, Summerset, Galahad, Leondardo, Peabody, Feeney, McNabb, Whitney and Tibble), it was learning about Eve and Roarke's pasts that propel us to want more.Eve is trying to solve the mystery behind who killed Roarke's trusted assistant, Karo's son-in-law. Karo's daughter, Reva Ewing is married to an artist, Blair Bissell who is discovered stabbed to death in bed with Reva's friend, Felicity Cade. Roarke believes that Reva did not kill them, although she is found at the scene of the crime. Reva afterall has taken a bullet for the president (an ex-secret service agent) and is one of Roarke's most trusted employees. As the plot unravels, Eve finds that not only could Roarke's future (he owns a high tech security company, like he owns most of the world) be in danger, but the world at large. She is thrust into a world of techno terrorist, worm viruses, spies (AKA spooks), covert missions,and computer programs (Code Red)that could make someone a fortune. While solving the highly unusual murder, which of course leads to others, Eve learns how her past is linked to Roarke's, and they soon find themselves ultimately "divided" about what Roarke should do. What I found to be most compelling was the sacrifices each ultimately has to make to make the other happy. I loved it, and although at time there is a lot of smoke and mirrors, you eventually are happy with the outcome.

When I started the book, I was not sure if I would be able to finsih it. It was..I am not sure of the word that I am looking for. I probably would give it a 3.5, but short of a 4, because I kept wondering, was Sophie, able to survive a past that was not solely hers. The reason I feel compelled to write this review is because I think was interesting to see how Haitian women, or women in general are affected by their mother-daughter relationships. The way you look at life or respond to life depends in effect on how your mother does. All in all, it was a wonderful portrayal of how the demons of your mother sometimes become yours. The main character, the result of a rape, fights her whole life to understand her mother, who was a cancer survivor and victim of ritualistic practices. It was all very interesting but at the end, I found myself wondering would the survivor, the daughter live to teach her daughter something new, or were they simply creating a never ending cycle of misunderstanding and betrayal. The novel eventually ends with the main character's mother stabbing herself to death to end a pregnancy that she feels she can not survive (mentally). The story ends in Haiti where the story begans, and we wonder about the future of the heroine and if she overcomes her eating disorder and grows to have a normal sexual relationship with her older/patient husband. I don't know essentially how I felt about this novel. Perhaps there were too many unanswered questions.

D.C. journalist Cal McAffrey (Crowe) is forever chasing down his next big story. Suddenly, he finds himself in the middle of a mystery/scandal that could not only rock the foundation of D.C. politics, but his friendship with Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck). Collins is in the mist of a scandal, a young, beautiful member of his staff (Sonia) appears to have died under mysterious circumstances, and it would seem he was having an illicit affair with her. McAffrey and his trusty sidekick/rising investigative journalist Della Frye (played by Rachel McAdams) are determined to get to the truth, but eventually find that Sonia's death may be related to the recent death of a drug dealer. What does this all REALLY mean? Will McAffrey's relationship with his friend (Collin's), or his lust for Collin's wife (played by Robin Wright Penn), cloud his judgment? Will he "sacrifice his story" for love or glory? Chalked full of countless scandals, political cover-ups and other twists and turns you are spellbound until McAffrey discovers the startling truth. Everything in Washington is not what it seems.While I am not a Crowe or Affleck fan, I really enjoyed this movie. They were both captivating and enthralling. And there were tons of great actors, among them bad boy/all knowing insider Justin Bateman. Definitely see this movie if you are in the mood for a decent plot performed by some talented actors, which could explain why I enjoyed this movie so much. It far exceeded my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. And while the end was a little "unbelievable", the journey getting there was enjoyable.

I love Due and this was no exception. The Between is powerful, wonderfully written and extremely creative.In her first novel, Due sets the stage for the consequences of what could happen (both mentally and physically)if you could change your FATE and cheat death. We are introduced to Hilton James, whose memories of his beloved grandmother are haunting and confusing...he sees her dead in their kitchen, only to get help and find her alive and cooking at the stove. Years later, he is still troubled by these memories and seeks professional help from his psychiatist/friend. While attempting to salvage his fragile mind, he is overwhelmed with events that change, memories that are not real (cheating on his wife), and events that did not (in reality it would seem) occur, his wife, a candidate for a judgeship is being threatened by a racist stalker. (There also appears to be a connection between Hilton's powers and the stalkers.) Loving his family and wanting what is best for them, he struggles to maintain his hold of reality. In a novel filled with "parallel worlds, doorways to other dimensions and travelers", Hilton seems to be scared, confused and lonely. What we later learn is that Hilton's grandmother (who rescued him from drowning and lost her life) appears to have suffered from the same type of events...she too appears to have the ability to cheat death. But as they say in Final Destination....you really can't cheat death, and that is why the end of the novel is so powerful. In the end, we see Hilton once again faced with the option to "cheat death" or "succumb" and you should read this powerful, well written novel to see what he finally decides.

Shia LaBeouf is being manipulated and framed for threats against the government and the President. His twin has been murdered and he is forced to do things that he doesn't want to do (by a gentle, female voice on the phone), all with the help of an unwilling, single mother played by Michelle Monaghan. Torn between fear and duty to Country, LaBeouf and Monaghan, follow a series of steps to unmask who is behind the plots and why. Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton are wonderful in their support roles as law enforcement officers, who soon begin to believe that everything is not as it seems.While I found the movie entertaining (chase scenes especially) and somewhat exciting, I don't think there was anything too original. This plot, the "Big Brother/Artificial Intelligence" gone mad concept, has been done several times before (Stealth, I-Robot, Terminator, Minority Report, Transformers, etc), and this one really didn't have anything new. Although the computer supposedly gained "intelligence" or at least began making decisions based on what "it" thought was best for the country, there still should have been more of a fail safe on the system in place. Now don't get me wrong, I am personally intrigued by artificial intelligence (in movies usually something that we mere humans have created) that "realizes itself" and attempts to erase mankind for the betterment of all. Terminator, for example, was the perfect balance between "artificial intelligence and realization" because they looked human but feel that the world would be a better place without us, while the computer generated female voice felt that our world would be a better place with a different President and Cabinet. I think it was a decent movie, I just wish it had been better.

Someone wants Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), retired CIA/assassin, dead. Now living a very uneventful life, Frank finds solace and companionship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker), a seemingly bored customer service representative. Monthly he uses the excuse of his checks being issued in the wrong amount to work his way into her life. After an attempt is made on his life, the unknown enemy decides to kidnap his new love interest and use her for bait, which inevitably turns in a game of cat and mouse. Determined to rescue her and discover the truth, Moses visits other retired agents seeking their help. And what a group of talented actors, who each brought an authentic quality to their roles (with the exception of one that I will mention later). Joe (Morgan Freeman) is living in a retirement home, literally dying and this seems to be an opportunity for some last minute fun. Victoria (Helen Miran) is enjoying her life as a simple woman (who once put three bullets thru the man she loved simply because the agency wanted her to) and would remind you of a loveable but deadly grandmother. Paranoid, conspiracy theorist Marvin (played by the delightful John Malkovich) is only to willing to show Moses how the present events are related to a past transgression of someone they know. Ivan (Brian Cox) is simply willing to spend time with the woman who he has never stopped loving, even if she shot him (3 times) and left him for dead. There is the devoted and dedicated CIA Agent who will stop at nothing to get his man. And finally, there is the very shady Alexander (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not what he appears, and who believes that he single handedly has created the Vice President (Julian McMahan) who is destined to be President. Both are willing to stop at nothing in an effort to protect a secret. Eventually, Moses figures out why they all have been scheduled for elimination and works hard to reveal the truth.I thought that this was a decent movie with a great cast. However, I did struggle with the final rating and ended up giving this movie a 3.5 to 4. I tend to rate it higher because the fabulous actors made me overlook the defects in the storyline. The only character that I was never sure about was that of Sarah. I kept thinking that the final twist should have been that she was an agent meant to seduce Moses but also learn the truth (or something...more), instead she just seemed a little too simple lacking the same depth that the other characters. She moved from wanting to get away, to falling into line wanting to participate in a dangerous adventure. I don't know, she was the only character that I really didn't like, which was hard since she was the center of the storyline. Perhaps another actress would have made the character more likeable for me. Anyway, I definitely would recommend this for someone who is looking for just the right amount of humor and adventure.

Oh BOY...how can a show that I love change in mere Seasons? I vowed last season that I would not watch anymore unless the writing improved. But oh boy, things have only gotten worse. A show that use to capitalize on grit and glamour, now appears to merely be trying to cover-up bad writing with sex and frankly more sex. I decided to just catch up on the entire season, give the show another chance, and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, I had trouble stomaching it. It was just too much. Storylines involving birth defects and organ thefts, and other issues have finally made me reconsider watching the show. The only redeeming value for the show was the return of the tattooed man. It appears that a show about the superficial has become just that. Perhaps a return to those original thoughts and ideas for the show will bring new life into the series. I guess the ultimate question is "Will I give Season 5 a chance"? Probably not unless someone tells me that the old fire is back. Unfortunately, Nip/Tuck may have lost a die hard fan unless some real changes occur.

Facebook has become one of the most used social networking sites. And while Facebook has grown by leaps and bounds, its creator (Mark Zuckerberg) seems both illusive and mysterious, maybe even aloof, yet brilliant. "Social Network" was intended to offer us a look (fact or fiction) into the psyche of Zuckerberg as he builds something that will influence society in ways that we never imagined. We view Zuckerberg's rise...from his creation of an idea that resulted from an uncomfortable situation with a girlfriend...to those speed bumps that marred his rise to notoriety. While his intentions initially seem "mean spirited", you see what power someone can have when they are able to communicate with large numbers of people with mere keystrokes. While he intended to embarrass a girlfriend, he literally created an idea that would revolutionize communication with the creation of the Facebook. While it seemed that his genius often caused him to be insensitive to his friend's feelings and at times seem heartless, you soon come to understand the sheer genius of someone who is so caught up into creating something unimaginable that they become "disconnected", not necessarily arrogant or ambitious (as you would expect).The movie also delved into the two lawsuits that surround the evolution of Facebook. There was Zuckerberg's best-friend who not only bankrolled the operation, and created the language that allowed the system to interface (or something like that), but who was pushed aside when Napster creator/party animal Sean Parker burst on the scene (who suggested changing the name from "the Facebook" to just "Facebook"), with ideas that would literally move Zuckerberg's College networking system to the International arena. The other lawsuit revolved around Harvard/Olympic bound twins who felt that Zuckerberg stole their idea after they approached him about creating a dating site. As the two suits are eventually resolved, you aren't really sure if anyone is really a winner, especially from the perspective of Zuckerberg whose reputation, energy and time has gone into fighting both. To me, the movie really wasn't about the money or the fame, but about how ironic it is that someone who is responsible for single-mindedly changing communication through social networking could seem so alone. His seeming ineptness, social awkwardness, or perhaps lack of concern for others makes you truly sympathize for him. But then again, aren't most geniuses socially ackward?I am not sure if this is fact or fiction, and it really isn't important. Social Network was a thought provoking movie that I recommend without reservation. I think that Jessie Eisenberg was brilliant (mannerisms and diction) as Mark Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield was compelling as the dedicated yet betrayed best-friend. And Justin Timberlake is exceptional as Sean Parker, the charismatic Napster developer. Again I recommend this movie to those who want to see how an idea can revolutionize the world and change society as no other.

Bette Robinson has found herself in quite the predicament. A graduate of Emory University (ok, I am an alum and just had to say that), working a corporate job that isn't making her happy, she trudges thru her life reading romance novels and spending time with her friends. So when she finally can't take it anymore, and walks out on her mundane job in investment banking, she decides to make some changes in her life. Determined to help her, her humorous uncle, finds her a job that will change her life. Having been raised by liberal parents, she always imagined working for a non-profit, so imagine her chagrin, when she starts working for one of the most popular PR firms in town, partying with the beautiful people and even pretending to be in a relationship with one of the most popular playboys known to the party scene. While Bette navigates her new life, she also finds a love interest in the most peculiar place, in the arms of an old friend. While jet setting around the world and partying with her not so usual crowd, Bette fights hard to continue supporting and protecting those she loves and holds dead. There are tons of comical characters, and a few plot twists and turns, but overall I found this story to be somewhat entertaining, but disjointed. There was something lacking, and the witty conversation and comical dialogue didn't cover that up. I don't know what it was that did not connect to me. It may have been that I didn't really care either way about Bette, or become invested in her character. She seemed a little one dimensional and sold out on her ideals a little quick. Either way, if you are interested in chick-lit, involving a world of lack-luster people....that mentions snippy gossip columnist, hip-celebrity haunts, the name dropping of certain celebrities, with some back stabbing friends and British bad-boys thrown in, this may be the book for you. But if you like a more comprehensive story read the "Devil Wear Prada".

This was a hard review for me because there were a lot of things I liked about the book and a lot of things that I didn't. And the sad thing is that I can not decide what to give it...so I ended up giving it an average rating. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.Things I liked about the novel: the murder mystery plot, someone killed a housewife, in a supposedly safe Connecticut suburb; the loveable sidekick/best friend, Janie; a complicated main character/bored housewife, Kate Klein. Being a mother myself, I was interested to see how Weiner would handle some of the situations that Kate encountered. Kate Klein is a housewife (to a man who doesn't seem to appreciate her or value her as an individual)and mother of 3 (a daughter and twins...Kate ironically is shocked to find herself pregnant again, and with twins no less, shortly after the birth of her daughter), who finds herself thrown into the murder of a fellow housewife. However, Kate, who has never really fit into the "Connecticut scene" struggles daily to just relate to her fellow housewives and soccer moms. She describes herself as not perfect, neither in her role as a mother, wife, or fellow Connecticut socialite. The only thing that she appears to be good at is getting to the bottom of her friend's (only because she found her body)murder. She uses her old talents as an ex-reporter/columnist to investigate Kitty's death. Simply stated, she wants to know who killed "Perfect" Kitty and why? Throughout the novel, she reflects on her relationship with Evan (a man she always wanted) and wonders what relationship he had with Kitty (I can't tell you everything because you wouldn't want to read it...but I will say that Evan's name was written on a piece of paper near the crime scene)? Also linked to Kate's past and present is a wonderful, spoiled friend named Janie, who sticks by her and attempts to tell her what is best for her, no matter how Kate takes it. Oh, and there were two scenes that I can remember vividly, one scene was as Kate stood before the mourners at Kitty's funeral and sang "If you're happy and you know it clap you hands"....and the other was when Janie slipped Kate's mother some estacy accidentally during a dinner party..both made me laugh out loud, because this seemed to sum up her views of herself...when it rains it pours.Now the cons of the book......it was tooooo long (much like this review..LOL)and when the crime is solved you are a little shocked, but by the time it occurs, you really don't care because the focus was now on "how bad her marriage was", "how nothing in this small town is as it seems", "that maybe everyone isn't perfect in her small social circle", "how her husband thought that all she was capable was being a housewife", "how she felt incomplete and useless because she wanted to do more than meet the other wives at the park and have them make her feel so inadequate (not as fashionable or as thin...or as good a mother as they are)?", "why she couldn't have a normal relationship with her mother? (Her sometimes absent mother was a famous singer and Kate's singing was good, just not to the level of her mother)", "what should she do about her unresolved feelings toward Evan (one night they kissed, but he later said he was getting married. She was devastated although she had information that his fiance'was cheating.)?", and "does she still love her husband" (he seems dismissive and condescending? The mystery seemed secondary, although she was clearly taking steps to solve it. There were just a lot of rough spots in the story, and at the end....I just didn't understand what Weiner wanted us to get out of it....everything seemed so unresolved...except for the fact that Kate still loves Janie and now her mother has finally put her first (over her opera career) you don't know. She was still confused about her relationship with her husband (he asks her to come home)and Evan (asks her to give him a chance...basically life is too short, we should have been together); she solves the reason and appears to have discovered the real reason why Kitty was killed)...but something was missing. So based on how I feel about the book, I can only give it a 3.

Hiding in Ireland with their father (the grey haired assassin from Boondock Saints) for the past 8 years, the MacManus brothers are being pulled back to Boston by someone who killed a priest using their trademarks (pennies on the eyes). Of course the returning crew of police detectives from Boondock I (who have since sainted the MacManus brothers for doing what they only dream of doing...rid society of scum) don't believe they are responsible and have the pretty, big belt wearing FBI Agent Eunice Bloom (from Buffy, Angel and Dexter) who agrees. They realize that someone wants the brothers to come out of hiding. The Yakavetta Family Mob Boss (played by Judd Nelson) only knows that he wants revenge for his father's death, and the death of the Saint's is the only answer. Meanwhile, we find out how and why the Elder MacManus became a killer (ironically it was the death of his father by mobsters). There is also his eventual capture and incarceration as a result of his brandishing his own sense of justice. As the person at the center of this charade is unveiled, you will marvel at the quick and easy pace of the movie.Now while I loved part 1, there were times in part 2 that I thought they tried way too hard. The easy flow of humor from Boondock 1, at times seemed forced in 2. I also don't think that Bloom was half as good as Dafoe's Smecker. But all in all I was satisfied with the final product, and I am sure that we will see the Saints again, I just hope Duffy goes back to some of the magic he created in Part 1. For those who just want to pick up Part 2 without seeing Part 1, I wouldn't suggest it. As a stand alone, you probably won't get or appreciate it, OR understand Part 2. But as a sequel you'll appreciate it where the Saints have been and where they are going because this movie picks up right after the last one. Either way, have a "Saint Marathon" one weekend and gooble up a great story.

The reason that I have chosen to give this book a 5 instead of a 4, is because I am happy that Patterson has moved away, if only briefly from Alex Cross. LOL. I was glad to see something different out of this very talented writer (although I like the winged people series...because it is of course different). The story is simple, GOOD GUY (although he has a bad side...he is a thief) meets Tess, a hottie on the beach (we later learn she is not what she seems...well you can guess that..no one is perfect). Anyway, life couldn't get any better....you have been offered an opportunity to make quick (although illegal) money and get the girl of your dreams....when, the unexpectant happens (all your friends who are involved in the heist are murdered, as well as the chick you have fallen for) and you are framed for their deaths. Now the story begins, who killed your friends and your lover and why? While Ned Kelly struggles to find out the truth about who is behind his trouble, he meets another woman, Ellie, a FBI agent who specializes in Art to help him discover the truth. As a host of other characters and villians are revealed, you will find yourself rooting that Ned's luck changes soon. I suggest that you give this easy and quick read a chance and enjoy. There are some interesting revelations and plots.

Meet Henry "Hank" Thompson (ex-high school baseball player/star turned alcoholic and all around nice guy), add a favor for a friend (to watch a neighbor's cat "Bud", who ends up being the "key" to the mystery) + a crooked/sadistic cop + some sweat-suit-wearing Russian bad guys + countless other bad guys (two extremely bad brothers)+ a secret key (hidden in Bud's crate) that opens a storage room with 4.4 MILLION dollars + 1 lost kidney + countless gun fights and lots of killing = a novel that will leave you breathless until the final scene. Some will survive and some won't. People will do things they never thought that they would, but overall the theme is that sometime you can get "caught up" in events that are beyond your control. Both visceral and gritty, this novel leaves you wanting more.

I don't think this continuation in the series was as good as "Caught Stealing", but I couldn't wait to read it. This novel picks up several years (about 3 I think) after Hank's departure from New York with the 4 million. Hank is now living in Mexico, part owner/silent partner of a bar, swimming and attempting to heal from the mess that went down years before, when a Russian backpacker comes to town. Again we see Hank caught up in circumstances beyond his control. Hank is now not only fighting for his life, but the ones he loves (his parents). We ride again in Hank's rollercoaster of misfortune. Will he survive? Get the second novel in the series and enjoy. Although not as good as the first one, Huston deserves credit for being gritty and creative. What I wondered at the end of the novel, was would we see ever see the cat again?

If you want something that is light (took me about 2 hours),entertaining and will tide you over until Sherriyn Kenyon's next novel comes out, read Dragonswan. Of course, it is quick (so don't expect the detailed background history and analysis of her characters) because she only devotes a few sentences to each (telling you both had horrible childhoods), but you'll love them anyway. It is the brief glimpse into their lives, and their love, that will make you smile.

I usually like Corbin books, but this one was just ok. I guess I wish there had been more of some things and less of others. I would have even liked to find out more about Myron's close friend, Win, who appeared to be a psycho, but they never really explained why. I could have read less about Ali, his new, lack-luster love, who was a 9/11 widow, but average looking unlike his ex. There was way too much time spent on that. And maybe this was just not a good stand alone novel. Maybe if I had read the other Myron Bolitar novel, a lot of the foolishness in this one, would have made sense.I know what you are thinking, with all of this negative stuff said, what merits the 3 (probably more of a 2.5, and I will usually round higher). Well the premise behind the story was simple and had a lot of promise. Myron Bolitar makes two teenage girls promise, after overhearing a conversation between them, that they will call him if they are ever in trouble. (Kind of silly for a middleaged man to do, especially with some teenage girls, but he CARES). True to her promise, Aimee Biel calls during the middle of the night, and disappears shortly after he drops her off. From that point on, Myron is tossed into a world of abusive fathers, cheating spouses, teenage sex, college acceptance letters, drugs, and a variety of other scandalous happenings in his hometown.Where I think the story wavered was the attempt to focus a lot of the story on Myron's relationship with the widow, while he tried to solve the mystery of Aimee's disappearance. Besides being the wife of a 9/11 widow, I thought her character was bland and boring. All of her efforts to schedule nooners or nightcaps only to be interrupted by her kids, was silly. And then he meanders the first half of the novel thinking about his gorgeous, talented novelist ex-girlfriend, who wouldn't marry him but is engaged to some rich guy, and then when given the opportunity to get back with his lost love, he decides maybe he is in love with the Ali.The plus of the novel are the many facets of Myron and Win. Win is mysterious and sexy, while dangerous. While Myron believes that he is a saviour or a knight in shining armour. There are other characters who merit mention, like Myron and Win's, very fiesty bi-sexual business partner, ex-pro female wrestler, Esperanza. Although she was sprinkled throughout the novel, she was extremely entertaining.Overall, I am not sure that I would recommend this book to other. I don't think that this is a stand alone book, and the ending was a bit too much. It really was a little too coincidental and silly. But if you are an avid reader, like myself, you may just try it!

I enjoyed these wonderful short stories by Christine Feehan, and would have even loved if the first one "The Awakening" had been longer.The first short story "The Awakening" was about a young woman, Maggie Odessa, who always loved wild animals, especially large cats, and could not resist the urge to visit the rain forest once she was told that she had inherited a jungle home. Once in the rain forest, she finds it alluring and irresistable. Apparently someone has lured her there because they realize that she will soon experience the "Han Vol Dan"...(and you must read to find out what that is). As Maggie unlocks the mystery of who she is and what she is fast becoming, will she fall in love with the man who already knows, loves and accepts her?The second story "Wild Rain" is about Rachel Lospostros who is on the run from a dangerous assassin. After having several attempts made on her life, she decides to escape to a jungle hideaway where she is mauled by a leopard belonging to the very reclusive Rio Santana. Rio, an outcast amongst his people, realizes that he is drawn to Rachel and doesn't understand why. As she recovers from her injuries,and attempts to hide from her past (among them a wayward brother, Elijah, who I would love to read more about), she finds herself being drawn to Rio and his odd ways. What she doesn't realize is that she too is experiencing the "Han Vol Dan". As both women navigate there troubled pasts, they find love with men who are both captivating and adventurous.I suggest that anyone who likes to read about romance and shape shifting read this novel. It was extremely entertaining and difficult to put down. I am now searching to see if there are any other novels by Feehan concerning these characters. I would love to find out how all of their lives progressed. And as you all know, this is the sign of a good writer, one who leaves you wanting more.

aybe I liked this film because (1) I was not expecting anything, (2) I am not a Don Cheadle (although I loved him in Crash) or Adam Sandler fan, and I knew very little about it. What I did know was that "on demand" is probably the best invention since "the remote control"! So, when all else fails, or if you are bored, you can always order a movie from on demand. So, imagine sitting on the sofa, with tons of things that you could be doing, but saying I am going to take a few minutes to veg-out with a good movie. Out of a list of dozens, I selected "Reign on Me" and have not regretted it. When I started to review this movie, I glanced at the reviews and was puzzled by some of the criticisms. Maybe because I didn't have any expectations, I was pleasantly pleased.The story is unique, in my opinion because of the subject matter....the idea that someone could completely lose themselves in hopelessness and despair. What I found to be so thought-provoking was the concept of how some people cope a traumatic and unexpected loss, especially one of a spouse, during a violent incident, especially one like 9/11. Just imagine all of the regrets (the last thing that you said or argued with your loved one about), the "what ifs" (what if I had made a different decision, would the outcome be the same)? These are all questions that I know people who experience tragedy face (I work with Homicide survivors and I know first hand). "Reign on Me" is the journey of two men, linked by their pasts, experiences a crisis of sorts. One is trying to fight his way back from the brink of hopelessness, and the other is trying to figure out why he is dissatisfied with the life he has. Alan, Don Cheadle's character, a dentist, is facing charges of inappropriate conduct or sexual harassment by a patient (who has a series of issues of her own). Faced with everything a man should possibly want (a beautiful wife, played by Jada Pinckett-Smith and two wonderful daughters) he finds himself wondering why he feels troubled, and is desperately looking for answers at every turn (even striking up conversations with a Psychologist in his building). He is struggling desperately to juggle his own sense of despair, with demands both personally and professionally that seem to be pushing him to the brink. One day he sees his old Dental School roommate and realizes that Charlie (played by Adam Sandler) has found what he seeks, a means of escaping reality. While Alan attempts to rescue Charlie from himself, we see the two work their way through their problems to make themselves better people, and perhaps one day whole.There were several things that I liked about the movie, among them: the relationship between Alan and his wife and how they showed that sometimes marriage is work and when you attempt to navigate those "rocky" waters without your spouse, you can get lost; how people sometimes react when confronted with loss; and how you life can be influenced by one event, one person; and how sometimes what you think is bad, really isn't when you find out what others are going thru. I also enjoyed seeing Adam Sandler in a non-comedic role. I didn't know that he had that kind of range. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and don't intend to go into more detail about the plot. Rent it and enjoy.

Some people around us have nothing, virtually existing in a world where food is a luxury and opportunity is seldom available. Michael Oher is one of those people. Michael Oher, homeless, parentless (for all intents and purposes....his mother is a drug user) and misunderstood, just needs a break. The opportunity comes when Michael encounters Leigh Anne Touhy, an aggressive Southern Belle and wife to ex-Athlete and Taco Belle chain owner (85), Touhy. They both see this as an opportunity to help a someone who has never had a bed or been a part of a traditional family (although Leigh Anne's idea of a Thanksgiving dinner is take out). Michael a big guy with a gentle soul, and a lot of heart works hard to achieve his goal, and soon finds himself up for a football schedule having to decide between Mississippi and Tennessee.While some may be tired of these kind of feel good movies, there is still a place for them in our minds and hearts. I too was reluctant to watch "The Blind Side", after all I've seen, other football related dramas like "Remember the Titans" and "We are Marshalls" and wondered what could this movie offer? Well, I have to admit that I am glad that I did. Although all are based on true stories, about men who beat the odds (whether it was segregation, racism or simply their misfortunes) to become professional athletes, the "Blind Side" suggests that there are some people in society who do for others with no hope of reward or recognition for the acts themselves. And in this story, although race was an issue, it seemed to focus more on the socio-economic difference between Michael and the Touhy's, versus race. Although some questioned the motives of the Touhy family, to mentor and later adopt a young athlete who had tons of potential, I believe that they did it because they wanted to make a difference. The tutor, the coaches, and even Leigh Anne's children, all worked together to make Michael a success.

This novel was a wonderful conclusion to a wonderful story. Although I traditionally like to use my imagination to determine what happens to the characters in the future. But, surprisingly enough, McFadden decided to tell us all that we wondered about. She brilliantly draws all of the character's lives together in one, neat ball. We see how each character was dependant, unbeknownst in them on each other. Their lives are intertwined and always would be. We even learn where those tiny pieces of paper that Sugar sent into the wind landed. This novel was breathtaking, intriguing, filled with symbolisms and depth.

Shawn Gallagher is a dreamer, often spending time composing songs in his head. While a talented chef by day, he spends his nights writing songs and is nights composing beautiful music. Brenna has longed for Shawn as long as she has known them. Being best friends with Darcy (Shawn's sister) and knowing Shawn for most of her life, Brenna decides to make a bold move telling him how she feels suggesting that they have only a physical relationship. Reluctant to risk his heart, Shawn isn't sure he wants to start a relationship with someone he had worked so hard to treat as a sister. Darcy is strong willed and wants to move Shawn a little faster than he is accustomed to moving both with their relationship and his music. To complicate matters, an ambitious New York builder (Trevor Magee) wants to open a theater in Ardmore, wants to purchase/lease land from the Gallaghers. As the two find romance, they must dodge the minefields of being in a casual relationship while maintaining a friendship. Shawn is romantic while Brenna is aggressive, and while she thinks that all she wants is sex with no ties, she soon comes to find that she wants more. And neither wants Fae Prince, Carrick, in his desire to break a curse, manipulate them into anything for his gain.I enjoyed "Tears of the Sun". It allowed me to catch up on those we have come to love: Aidan, Jude and Darcy. Jude is pregnant and has sold her story of beloved tales and legends. Darcy is still making plans to escape Ardmore and make it big. And Aidan is still making a fine guiness. With that being said, I enjoyed "Tears of the Moon" and highly recommend it to those who love Nora Roberts.

I think this is the best Hoag book that I have read in a long time. Kovac and Liska were in other stories, but here, we see them grow and they become even more endearing.The story is simple, a family has been brutally killed in Minneapolis. This crime has galvanized the community to seek revenge against the assailant, arrested suspect Karl Dahl. A mother and her two foster kids are brutally killed and hung, leaving a grieving son and father. As the store unfolds, we are introduced to Carey Moore, a Superior Court judge who is wrestling with a ton of issues: among them a loveless marriage to a struggling film maker; a father who was once a brilliant judge, but who now is suffering from Alzheimer's and dying; and a case that no one wants to touch. Judge Moore makes the ultimate decision to not allow the prosecution to go into Mr. Dahl's "Prior Bad Acts" as she sees them as being to prejudicial and not relevant to his present charges. This controversial decision starts a chain of events that will change everyone's life before the novel is concluded. Following the ruling, Judge Moore is brutally attacked and the suspect escapes. As Kovac and Liska begin to investigate the judge's assault, they try to determine if the escape, the attack and the murders are related. Just who would want Judge Moore hurt...or even worse, dead?Could it be Judge Moore's husband, who we soon learn is not what he initially seemed to be (he is a cheater, and heavily in pornography)? Could it be the escaped killer (who is clearly unstable)? Or could it be the disillusioned, homicide cop who was initially assigned the Haas murder only to later be so twisted by what he had seen? Or could it be one of the surviving family members of the Haas family?A host of interesting characters emerge: Bobby Haas (the adopted son of the murder victim who has seen his share of death and dying); his father (a survivor in name only, he is slowly dying from his grief; and a host of others. But what is most telling is the relationship that evolves between Judge Moore and Sam Kovac. Initially there was no love lost between Moore and Kovac...his sense of right and wrong, clashed with her sense of justice, but soon they find that they really need each other. Fighting his own demons (two failed marriages, a child he doesn't see, and basically no personal life), Kovac appears to have found a comrade in the broken-hearted judge, and her fearless daughter. While trying to protect Carey from a psycho on the loose, a dead-beat husband and a crazed homicide cop, he appears to be falling for her.Filled with twists and turns, each detective gets an opportunity to reflect on their own lives and shortcomings. Liska....a mother, looks at Bobby Haas as a victim, and is trying desperately to save his soul. Kovac sees everything he could have with Carey, while seeing what he does not want to become (a lonely, bitter and broken homicide detective) like the one investigating the Haas murders.Although I think most can guess the end, it was brilliantly written in that it drove home the idea that "everything may not be what it seems".

Sandra Bullock plays Margaret, an uptight, ambitious publisher who is going to be deported following her visa's expiring. Trying to save her career, she bullies her assistant, Andrew into agreeing to marry her. To complicate matters, Andrew is suppose to go home for the weekend and celebrate his grandmother's (played by Betty White) 90th birthday. So imagine the events that unfold as he takes his blackberry totting, rigid boss home and introduces her to his tight knit family. Margaret is not only surprised by his wealth but the closeness of his family, even if it includes a disapproving father who believes his son can be more than a publisher or writer. As Margaret and Andrew navigate pretending to be lovers, guess what they do....they fall in love.There was an overzealous immigration agent, a wistful ex-girlfriend, a bartender/stripper/storekeeper extraordinaire and several other things that made this movie a hoot. I love romantic comedies, especially those starring the very sexy Ryan Reynolds, extremely funny Sandra Bullock, humorous T. Craig Nelson and loveable Betty White. I highly recommend this movie to those who for over an hour want to laugh out loud. You won't regret it.

I must admit that this is one of my favorite movies. I saw this when it first came out and loved it. Just imagine the premise, although some people think it is silly, back in the 80's (when I originally saw it) it was cutting edge, the concept I mean. Connor MacLeod is an immortal, who has lived for centuries, shunned by his village and hunted by some. He has outlived his true love and realizes that his gift (i.e., immortality) is a double edged sword..meaning while he lives forever, those he loves will not. Mentored by Ramirez, played by a dashing Sean Connery, Connor sets forth to simple stay alive and protect his secret. Leap forward to modern day New York an we see MacLeod is wealthy and living life as a recluse. Hunted by those who want his power, attracted to a woman who wants to learn his secret, we learn that other immortals are trying to behead him and receive the "quickening" (his immortality and power). Destined to live forever, because he can be killed and yet wake up later, with the exception of beheading of course, Connor sets out to protect his interests, his secret and maybe get the girl. What I think I liked more about the original, than the television series (which was made years later) is that Christopher Lambert has a haunted quality about him that simply takes your breath away. As he roams the Scotland countryside, and takes care of his aging wife, who he loves passionately, you realize that he will be alone forever. Although later sequels were not as good, his eyes (which seem to look into your very soul) will always leave a vivid image of someone who is well troubled and yet hopeful. But what is most powerful about this original is the cinematography...Scotland is absolutely beautiful! So rent it or purchase it, you won't be sorry.

I must admit I have really become a fan of the "Moon" series by Handeland. I have to admit that I have read all four to date and find them entertaining and easy to read.Imagine the possibilities, Doctor (Elise)attempting to cure "lycanthropy", and guess what she has the disease, and she left her lover several years ago for fear of how he would react to her condition, only to be reunited with her lost love (a studly agent) to solve a mystery. It's a wonderful story with a happy ending.

This book reminded me of some of Jackie Collins earlier works....and because I had not read one of her novels in a long time, I was pleased to see that she has a lot of talent and weaves a good tale.In Deadly Embraces, Collins tells the love story of Michael Castelli (a part time mobster, turned multi-billionare playboy) and Dani Castle (ex-Vegas Showgirl). Their romance, which spanned over 30 years is reviewed and we see their heartaches, relationships with other people, marriages to other people, birth of their children and various other life experiences.The novel begins with Michael's beloved daughter, Madison taken hostage at a restaurant, while Michael's past comes to haunt him. Everything is not what it seems and we soon learn that revenge or retribution is a dish best served cold.

Lydia Smith is dillusioned about her life. Once a renown para-archeologist, she finds herself snubbed by academia and working at a 3rd rate museum after a lost weekend in the catacombs. She finds herself in the middle of a mystery when her friend is found dead murdered in one of the exhibits, and a mysterious, sexy stranger (Emmett London) hires her to find a stolen family heirloom (cabinet). While Lydia struggles to resurrect her career, she also fights her growing attraction for her sexy (maybe even dangerous) employer who has more than one secret.This was a semi-interesting paranormal romance with ghost hunters, tanglers, intrigue and suspense. While I don't think this was the best Castle (i.e., Krantz) novel that I have read recently, there were elements that caught my attention....(1) the Cadence Guild (a group of ghost hunters that were compared to the mob); (2) "Fuzz" her six-legged ball of fur that apparently had predator night eyes; (3) the sweet romance and (4) the sci-fi stuff concerning the trappers and ghost hunters. With that being said, for a quick and easy read, "After Dark" satisfies.

I did not think the series could get any better, but imagine my delight when I cracked open my pre-ordered copy of the Forbidden. It has been six long months since the last installment in the Vampire Huntress Saga, The Bitten, but it was well worth the wait. (The only problem was I read it in 3 days...and now want more.) Mrs. Banks has left me breathless by taking the core characters to another level (example, now Carlos, who we last saw die in the sunlight, is a male neteru, who has not learned the full range of his powers), re-introducing old characters (Kamal, the were-human; Juanita and Inez; and the evil Councilman) and spiced up the story with new ones (Adam's first wife Lilith; a group of witches). And she even drops some new-found knowledge on the readers and makes them crave more (the power of the number 7). These novels continue to leave you wanting more, like a drug or a good cup of coffee. When you finish the last page, and read the excerpt, you will do exactly what I did, pre-order book #6, which is due to drop in February 2006. You will not be able to wait!

It just keeps getting better. In this, the latest installment in the VHS, D and Carlos are not only having to face their fears about their relationship, but face the consequences of their actions in previous books. Carlos, still confused about his "new" role as the male neteru is feeling insecure as the woman he has sacrificed himself for several times, remains distant and hesitant about their relationship. The Damned, a contagion/virus released by Lilith, the consort of the devil, is reeking havoc on the team and the larger world. The illness is causing death and destruction and could prove to be the end of humankind. While the team searches to stop the spread of the illness, they are battling internally because they too have been affected. Mrs. Banks leaves you spellbound as she shows the dilemma that the team has between their hearts and their duty. We see the teams struggle to live with decisions that they have made in the past, that appear to affect their futures.New characters are introduced and new plots are woven through this delightful story. Although not as fast paced as "The Bitten" (I would have given that one 10 stars if possible), it gives us information that will lead to a show-down of epic proportions.There are of course unresolved issues between the characters Yonnie/Tara/Rider; Carlos/D/Juanita/Jose; Kamal/Shabazz & Marlene; and JL/Chris/Dan. So we have a lot to look forward to as we see the issues resolved, new powers revealed and a show-down between the group and the unnamed one that I am sure will leave readers breathless.Finally, I will say that the series continues to leave you wanting more, like a drug or a good cup of coffee. Hey, I have already pre-ordered the Forsaken, due out this summer. And although I know the series will eventually end, Mrs. Banks has given us a series that will live in our hearts forever! Continue reading them, they will not disappoint.

As a lover of the Handeland series, I was not disappointed in Crescent Moon, the fourth installment in the series. Widow/Cryptozoologist Diana has been hired to hunt a wolf in New Orleans, where a series of deaths have been occurring. Trying desperately to hold on to the belief that her late husband was not insane, and that he really saw the things that he said he did, she sets out to solve the mystery of "who or what is killing people and why"? Once a reknown person in his field of study, the academic community now shuns her husband and has labeled him "crazy" because he believes in werewolves, and died while trying to prove it. Could werewolves and monsters be real? In order to find out, Diana heads into the swamps of New Orleans to solve the mystery.Crescent Moon has everything a romance/paranormal fan would want....a sexy/mysterious tracker/guide who is possibly cursed, and who also appears to be helping to capture the evil wolf (or he is simply protecting the wolf, that he is), while solving several and lots of murders. You also realize, halfway through the novel, that Diana will make a wonderful addition to the Jager-Suchers organization.

Broken was not the best Armstrong book by far, but was still good. I personally thought that the plot of this book dragged a little.....Elena (who is extremely rare...a pregnant female werewolf) accepts a job from a "not" friend, but associate to steal a letter supposedly written by "Jack the Ripper" to taunt police. Jeremy (Alpha Pack Leader) and Clay (his bodyguard and Elena's lover) accept the assignment because Elena is "bored" (she is tired of hiding out waiting for the big day...and they don't necessarily want other werewolves to find out that she is pregnant and taking it easy). Unfortunately, she unknowingly opens a portal and releases several zombies and a controller, and the race to correct all that is wrong begins. What I did not like about this novel is that (1) we never hear from Xavier (the "not friend" who asked her to do him this favor) again...he should have appeared atleast once to assist, (2) Armstrong mentions other characters in the "underworld" series, but it seems forced like she is trying to make sure she mentioned all the reoccuring characters so we don't forget them (Masten, Paige, Lucas, Cassandra, and Aaron). Even Xavier who sent them on this wild goose chase seemed forced. I for one could have thought of other people to begin this adventure. (3) I also had a problem with the whole "Jack the Ripper" storyline, which was confusing because it turned out that it really wasn't about Jack after all. And although I understood the rational, it was not an enjoyable plot. And finally (3) some of the stalking/searching from Zombie scenes lasted way too long. It seemed like they were spinning their wheels...catch zombie, kill zombie, see zombie a little later, decaying a little but still around. So, let's try to track the zombies and kill them again. This happened over, and over, and over.However, what merits the "4" rating were things like (1)the building relationship between reoccuring characters, Jeremy and Jaime, who are trying to ignore the fact that Jaime is in love with him, and (2)I absolutely LOVE Elena and Clay (and I am glad that she has gotten over the "he bit me and I am angry thing". She finally appears to have accepted her role as pact member and lifemate to Clay. And although in the end, Clay is recovering and Antonio and Nick are there, we really wonder what is in store for the new family.I can't wait to see what awaits Elena and Clay, who are now parents to twins, both of who appear to have inherited the werewolf gene.

I guess I expected this book to be as good as "Good in Bed", so I was disappointed. I have to say that I have read all of her books, and am reading "Goodnight Nobody" as we speak. Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy this one as much as the others. I would have given it 3.5 stars, but that was not an option, and I am not sure it really deserved a 4.The plot is simple. Meet Maggie (a beautiful, confused, irresponsible, and needy woman), who is the sister to Rose (a heavy-set, successful woman). Now you should know the problem....family secrets, deception and jealousy. Maggie does an unthinkable and unforgiveable thing...she sleeps with Rose's boyfriend. At this time, Rose kicks her out and shuns her (she's already angry that Maggie borrows or takes her shoes...that's one thing that they have in common, the same shoe size and love for pretty shoes). As we see Maggie struggle with her own demons, she begins to develop a sense of self when she moves in with her grandmother in a retirement community. She finds the strength to unravel family secrets and dissect her life, to weave a new one. She and her sister eventually make peace in this novel about family tragedy (their mother killed herself), forgiveness (each other and their father) and love. It is worth reading, but if you are expecting to feel the way you did after reading "Good in Bed", you won't but something close to it.

Normally, I really enjoy a good Margolin story, but this one was lacking. I would have given the novel a 2.5, and I was not so moved to give it a 3. I loved some of the story, but most of it was silly. I work in law enforcement and deal with cold cases, so the whole evidence tampering was possible, but I thought the motive was silly. If someone did manufacture evidence, I don't think it would have happened like this. I thought that the Crime Scene Tech who began initially committing perjury because he believed the people were guilty, but he definately stepped over the line when he killed Mary, his partner. I think the fact that Amanda Jaffe and her father appeared was one of the most redeeming factors in the novel, but overall, I thought that it was lacking.

I have two wrestlers in my house. One in middle school and the other in high school. When they both expressed an interest, I immediately thought about the "cauliflower ear" that I have seen on some wrestlers. As a mother, one of the things that I worry about is my son's health, and in this case his ears. Investing in good ear protection is a must, so I set out to find the most protective headgear on the market. We purchased this same brand of headgear for my oldest son, and he has had absolutely no problems with it. According to my son, the Cliff Keen F5 Tornado Headgear is comfortable and he definitely feels protected. He says that he doesn't feel the impact of someone grabbing his head, and that it stays firmly in place. He finds that the straps on the top and under the chin are comfortable and keep the headgear in place without making it feel too restrictive. It also doesn't interfere with his hearing. He likes the way they look and how the ear portion is translucent and would allow him to see dirt. This headgear is easy to clean (usually he wipes them off with a Clorox wipe before wiping them off with a warm damp cloth and hanging them up to dry. The Velcro is sturdy and seems to be constructed to last a long time. Over all, I am satisfied with my purchase. For the money, I got a reliable product that gives me and my little wrestler peace of mind.

Allison's sister wants to have a breast augmentation before her wedding (a surprise for her future husband). What else to do but switch lives with her twin for a few days while she recovers without her fianc&eacute; knowing? After all, Allison and Ann are identical twins, and couldn't be more different. So imagine how Allison feels when she has to leave her life as a mild mannered scientist to be her sister, a free spirited redheaded beauty. She never expected a harmless prank to lead to complications for both of them. Determined to claim the love of his life, Spencer Raft, is willing to end a long friendship with his bestfriend to have what he wants (Ann). Confused (about what she wants) and conflicted (about ruining her sister's plans), Allison yearns to tell Spencer the truth, that it is not Ann he has been dealing with but her sister. Finally, forced to reveal the truth, Allison can't wait to see if Spencer's truly desires her or the image she has created.Although there were times that the story was a little corny and dated (she's a virgin and he's a man willing to deflower her...), Thursdays Child was a quick and easy read. And while there were times that I didn't always care for Spencer's attitude, or the huge mystery behind his "career" (that once revealed was stupid), I didn't have to think real hard and was slightly entertained.

Percy "Perseus" Jackson knows he is different. He sees strange things (like letters floating off the page and shadows where they shouldn't be); has a small problem with his math teacher (Mrs. Dobb) who'd like nothing better than to kill him; doesn't really remember his father (but wants to); hates his stepfather, Gabe (who literally stinks); and finds himself constantly switching schools (because of the bizarre occurrences that happen around him). Learning that he is the half-blood of the God of the Sea (Poseidon), and must retrieve the one item (Zeus' Thunderbolt) that can prevent a war and return it to Olympus. Fearing for his life, and the end of the world as we know it, Percy must travel to Camp Half-Blood to discover the truth of who and what he is.However Camp Half-Blood is but the first stop in his travels on the way to Olympus. With the help of his two most trusted friends, Grover (a can eating satyr) and Annabeth (a half-blood), Percy not only gets an opportunity to kill a minotaur, behead Medusa, meet his father and returns his uncle's most prized possession, but he also uncovers a plot meant to destroy peace among the Gods. Needless to say, everything is not as it seems. And while worrying about saving the world may sound simple, Percy has to do all this while solving the riddle of what the Oracle meant when she gave three dire predictions, one of which he fears may be concerning his mother.My 11-year-old son gobbled up this book (and those that follow in the series), and challenged me to read it. He assured me that Percy's adventure rivaled no other, and once I read the first one I would be unable to stop myself from reading them all. Guess what? He was right. Riordan's tale made for several hours of reading enjoyment. There was magic, fight scenes, action, adventure and a wonderful story, which are all necessary to build the foundation of a terrific and mind-blowing series. And finally, my son was right, I have the rest of the series stacked in a pile (next to my bed) waiting to be read, and I can't wait.

Riley Crane (psychic, ex-military, FBI agent in the Special Crimes Unit, expert in the occult) wakes up covered in blood, fully clothed but minus her memory and her clairvoyant/psychic powers. Imagine her surprise when she doesn't even remember taking a lover, Ash ( an unconventionally handsome, charismatic District Attorney)or spurning another suitor (drop dead gorgeous , chief of police and close friend of Ash), or just what she was investigating when a decapitated man is discovered hanging near what seems to be a "ritualistic" crime scene.So in summary, the novel revolves around what Riley has been doing for the last three weeks that she can not remember and her efforts to determine who was killed, why and by whom. She manages to do all of this while still losing gaps of time,facing a boss (Bishop)who wants her back in Quantico if she doesn't recover soon; horrible memories of a serial killer she killed; evaluating her relationship with a lover she doesn't remember (although she says that her body does); loosing calories faster than she can eat them (powerbars to the rescue); questioning a friend who called her to Opal Island (Gordon); while seeking assistance from a cheery but helpful cop; and a group of satanist, all while struggling to get your clairvoyant/psychic powers back. I found this to be an entertaining novel. It only took me two days.

Nash Kirkland, horror novelist/screen play writer plans to center his next great novel on witchcraft. Although he has successful selling his supernatural works, he is a skeptic. But he has also decided that while he doesn't believe, researching and interviewing self-proclaimed witch, Morgana Donovan, would add an authentic element to his work. As Morgana opens his eyes and his heart, he wonders if she has used her powers to "bewitch" him. After all, he has never fallen for anyone as hard and as fast as Morgana. As the two navigate their new relationship, and Nash learns to trust, we are witness to a light hearted romance in a style that only Nora Roberts' can tell. If you enjoy Nora Roberts' works, you will definitely appreciate this easy to read quick romance. I will definitely seek out the rest of the series so that I can find out what happens to not only Nash & Morgana, but what happens with her two cousins (who are also witches) Sebastian and Anastasia.

I must admit that this was the first Massey novel that I have read...and it was good. I enjoyed the underlying theme of the strain between fathers and sons. Both the hero and the villian in the story have serious relationship issues with their fathers. One, the main character is returning to his family's home town after his father's disappearance. The villian, is attempting to resurrect his father, a vampire, following his death several centuries ago. The villian even turns his surrogate father, a history teacher in town, into the "living dead". Watching the story unfold, as the sons struggle to understand and accept what their fathers are, is extremely real. So go out and purchase the book. It is worth reading for that reason alone. It even caused me to purchase his others.

I don't think I saw the same movie that others who have reviewed this movie did. I thought that it was one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I hated it.Let me get this straight, people really appreciated and LIKED a movie about a "low budget" pimp who was "tricking" a girl so that he could achieve his "dream" of being a "rap star". Now the actors did the best that they could with what they had, but it still only merits a .5 and I am STRETCHING the 1 star....really I am. Now back to the "complicated" plot....the girl he has been pimping (she sleeps with a loser at a pawn shop to get her pimp a microphone) ends up becoming a "business woman" (she sleeps with a disc jokey to have her imprisoned pimps music played on the air). There was a scene that I found to be very entertaining. One character staples fast food cup holders to the wall to make it sound proof so the pimp can have a STUDIO. Yeah..right. DUMB! There were so many dumb parts in this movie, I lost track of them all.On top of being dumb, one of the actresses (the pregnant one who was standing by her "pimp/man" while he is in jail for beating up another "rap star" who dissed him...that's right..the plot becomes way complicated...and Dumber..wait is that a word) comes out of this whole experience thinking she can "really sing" in real life and sang it at the Oscars last year. And still...I am wondering what planet I am on, because they gave the stupid song an Oscar for best movie. Maybe I dreamed all that, or maybe I just don't know what a good movie is about! But in my opinion, this was not it.

Avatar was a wonderful...exciting.....beautifully made, well acted movie with tons of color, fight scenes and lots of movie magic. The plot was good, although not terribly original. The humans want something, in this case a mineral worth millions for just an ounce, from the natives (8 foot blue people known as Avatars). The Avatars want to maintain their culture/traditions, beliefs (trees containing the souls of those that have departed) while they keep their land (Pandora) as it is (unsoiled and untouched). The humans don't want to take "no" for an answer and create a time table for the Avatar to relent or be destroyed. Will Colonel Quariteh and his mighty military dominate? Meanwhile, Dr./Anthropologist Grace Augustine (Weaver) wants to study the Avatar culture and will stop at nothing to protect their interests. She is part of the team that created the technology that allows her to inhabit the body of a genetically grown Avatar while her human form remains safely asleep in a chamber. Enters the main character played by Sam Worthington (Jake Sully), who was the identical twin brother of a Doctor who was very involved with the project. Sully soon finds himself in quite the dilemma. If he helps the organization find the weakness of the Avatar, they have promised to get his legs back (apparently an expensive surgery that he could not afford if he doesn't do what they want), but this would mean betraying those that he has come to love (Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana). Jake soon finds that mingling with the Avatar (even if it is for only 3 months during which time he is to betray them) is going to be more complicated than he thought.There were several things to love about this movie. Besides the wonderful acting (Weaver is always great in Sci-Fi movies, and all other characters were equally believable.), the technology used was simply breathtaking. The colors and wonderfully vivid world of Pandora came to life on the 3D/Imax screen. And while I was expecting a lot, with all the hype and advertising that accompanied this movie, this was one of those rare occasions that I was not disappointed. Whatever you do, take some time out of your life and see Avatar and you will not regret it. And while I know that seeing this on a regular television will not be the same or do this epic drama justice, I will still await the release on DVD. It will be a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.

"Untraceable" is about Special Agent Jennifer Marsh, who is assigned to the Cybercrime Task Force Unit of the FBI. While monitoring hackers and other cyber crimes, she stumbles across a website that invites people to "killwithme". Therefore as the death count rises, so does the boldness of his actions and the motive for his senseless killings. What I found interesting about the movie was the entire premise of "if given a chance, would you watch, even if it meant someone would die, events unfolding on-line"? Would knowing that your mere actions would result in someone's death, stop you from watching or prevent you from clicking "enter" with your mouse? Maybe I analyzed it all too much, but based on what I know of our society and its need to know and my belief that most people are voyeurs, I think that people would tune in. Think about it, we live in a world of technology (blackberries, palms and PDAs) and reality television. How many people dial up to watch the ridiculous or simply watch things that they know are private? How many people dial up to watch Big Brother After Hours? Afterall, we live in a society where we want to view sex and or violence, even if on some level we know it isn't right, but we are curious. So hopefully that kind of explains why I gave this movie "3*s" because underneath it all, I think it offered food for thought.

I enjoyed this, Michael Moore's latest jab at societal ills. In this case, the big evil is American's love of "Capitalism". He documents the creation and evolution of capitalism. In his typical style, Moore examines America's fascination with Capitalism has led our country to commit financial suicide. Laying the blame in both political camps, Moore finds America reeling from foreclosures, joblessness and spending more money than they can afford by extending credit. Examining our Nation's belief in the free market, participation in free enterprise and competition, Moore suggests that our greed will and has become our downfall, which is evident by the collapse of the housing industry (increase foreclosures), the car industry (GM), and the downward spiral of our economy. And while it is clearly a societal dilemma Moore places the blame squarely on our shoulders. After all, it is our fault that we are in the predicament that we are. Whether you want to blame Wall Street (who Moore compares to a casino - they will bet on anything), large companies who cash in on the deaths of their employees (Walmart), or predator lending practices, Moore challenges each of us to do something with our anger and make a difference.

In "Dark Side of the Moon", Dark Hunter/Were-Leopard Raven Contis finds himself in quite the mess when he is captured by his worse enemy (some Daimons, who are being aided by humans) in cat form. Caged, collared and clearly agitated, he finds himself unable to escape knowing for certain that his captures have only one objective in mind, which begins and ends with his demise. Now enters an unsuspecting, investigative reporter turned tabloid writer, Susan Michaels who has been asked by her friends to rescue the cat (although she is allergic), who is really a very sexy man. While dodging danger, death and their growing attraction for each other, at every turn, the two find themselves struggling to prove her innocence (for her friends' deaths) and to solve who is behind the apparent uprising of Daimons and the deaths of certain Dark Hunters.Although woven throughout the story, Ravyn and Susan's love story is in the background as Kenyon builds the anticipation for the next installment in the series. She is clearly setting the stage for something big to happen to Nick, Ash, Stryker and others who we love from the series.For me, Sherrilyn Kenyon novels usually have just the right amount of romance, sex, and plot. However, this novel, while ok, did not leave me as satisfied as some of her others. I thought that the weakness of the novel was that if you have not read any of the other books in the series, some of the things mentioned do not make sense (for example, the Daimon strife, Ash's tragic life, and Stryker's anger). There are also times when the storyline didn't seem smooth but appeared a bit choppy. Things seemed forced or were put in with little or no explanation. Of course I realize that this isn't the last in the series, or the first, but it does require, in my opinion, some knowledge of the storyline. This is simply not a stand alone book.

"Flame" Johnson has a secret, and while trying to remain in hiding, she finds herself fighting her attraction to the very sexy, rugged, Special Forces agent, Gator Fontenot. As they both learn to trust each other, Flame learns the origin of her destructive powers, and struggles with the knowledge that her destiny may be already written in stone. Fighting to accept his growing feelings, Gator sets out to protect Flame at all costs. However, the question that always in front and center for Flame is "Is Gator what he appears to be"? Or "was he sent to bring her back to the man she most fears"? And finally, "Is the evil Doctor Whitney, who created them both, still alive and shaping their futures, not just their pasts"? Over all, this was an easy read, and I would like to see more of the ghostwalkers in the future.

Skeeter wants nothing more than to be taken as a serious writer. While her parents believe she should find a husband and settle down (after all she is getting old), she has a dream to set the literary world on fire. Living in the South (Jackson, Mississippi) during very turbulent times (the 1960's), Skeeter decides to write a story from the perception of the "help" (black maids). Secretly interviewing those around her, she finds more than she ever bargained for. Looking to her own home, and the relationship she had with her own housekeeper (Constantine, played by Cicely Tyson, who left under mysterious circumstances), Skeeter hopes that she can do the overall story justice, as well as shed light on what it means to be a second hand citizen.The story revolves around the lives of Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) and Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis). Minny (a rebellious maid) works for quite the character, Hilly Holbrook (played by Bryce Howard) whose sole focus is to keep the help in their place, maintain her position in Jackson society, and starting a movement to build separate facilities for the black help. While Minny does not hold her tongue or take anything from anyone, she accepts her role, while a victim of domestic violence. Then there is Aibileen who spends more time raising others children instead of her own. Regretting not being there for her own son who was killed years earlier, she looks at her participation in the project as a way of healing. Feeling that it is her duty to empower the children she is raising, she gives them a mantra to create character and belief in themselves. As the story culminates and the turbulent south erupts following the death of Medger Evans, Skeeter soon has enough participants to write quite the story.In conclusion, "The Help" was a wonderful story told by a very talented cast. Perhaps stealing the show was the charmingly beautiful Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who wants nothing more than to be accepted by those in her community and have a child. Celia proves to be what Minny needs to give her the strength to do what she never had the strength to do (leave her abusive husband), while Minny accepts Celia for who she is. Their mutual respect and understanding make them a force to be reckoned with and you know that they will both find happiness. I really enjoyed "The Help" and would recommend it to others.

As a part-time criminal justice instructor, I make this DVD required viewing. As someone interested in the subject matter I think it addresses a variety of issues: racial issues, delinquency, juvenile housing, gang violence, lockup procedures,and criminality in general. I think it also addresses some of the stereotypes concerning criminals and criminal behavior. Troy Kell is the perfect example of someone who came from a decent family, educated and had all the tools for success, and yet ended up on death row (1st killing a guy over some foolishness and then committing a murder while in prison). I think even to the average person, they would find Kell charasmatic, charming (oops, that is the same thing), with no regrets or excuses. Bravado or not we will never know, but Kell is definately someone to be studied for years to come.

I can not express how wonderful this novel was. The story begins with who we think is an ordinary man witnessing his beloved pets death (foreshadowing of things to come of course)...and within pages we discover that he is not what he seems but an immortal. We are then propelled into his background, memories and past life to witness what made him what he is. This love story attempts to tackle the concept of choice....meaning if you could choose to live for forever with someone you love would you? Although I think he views his situation as a curse sometimes....he has lived to see several wives and children die....he also sees the irony in experiencing all that life has to offer...for years..centuries even. His decision to try to make those he loves immortal has consequences, some good and some bad. We see him kill for no other reason than to protect his secret. We see him wrestle with the knowledge that his deepest desire could be his greatest undoing. This novel will leave you spellbound, much like the Highlander movies. You see how someone who can live so long, can be so lonely. Although I read the sequel, "The Living Blood", it did not have all the passion that this one had.I would give this novel a 10 if I could. And I have even picked this novel up over the years and read excerpts just to remember how wonderful it was. It is definately a must read that you should pick up the next time you are at the library or bookstore.

From the opening scene to the credits, "Machete" was violent, gritty and action packed. What I will say is that you will either love this movie, or hate it. I am one of those that LOVED it. Ok, you should also know that I appreciate Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Charlie Huston (Author of Hank Thompson series), Wayne Kramer (Running Scared) and Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints). I enjoy the crime noir or pulp noir genre of crime dramas because they tend to generate heated debates and discussions. No matter how you classify them, or what side you fall on (the love or the hate side), these sort of movies produce strong feelings...either negative or positive, and I think that is what most writers and producers hope for. There were some pretty controversial issues woven throughout the story.....vigilantism, immigration, drug abuse, sex, and violence....all of which set the stage for some pretty extraordinary events. Although the subject matter and the dialog may seem on the surface to be in poor taste and offensive, I viewed it as a vehicle to tell the story, and a very entertaining story at that.Synopsis:Day laborer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) has been approached and hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to shoot Senator McLaughlin (Robert Deniro). This assassination attempt was meant to endear voters to the Senator who is running on a "strict regulations against illegal immigrants" platform. What's better than a fallen hero? Anyway, what Booth does not realize is that Machete's past is a little more complicated than he initially realized. Machete is an ex-Federale (Special Agent) who was presumed dead after being shot in the head following a case that went terribly wrong, and even resulted in his wife being beheaded. Now living the simple life as a day laborer, Machete is associated with some very unique characters, among them Luz, a vigilante/activist whose main goal is to help those who truly need rescuing while running a taco truck. Unbeknownst to them both, they are being watched by the very tenacious, ICE Agent Santana Rivera (played by Jessica Alba) who wants to prove herself and bring in the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Booth is restless and has his own agenda, not to mention a very unstable drug dependant daughter, April (played by Lindsay Lohan) who he has some very impure thoughts about. To complicate matters, Booth also has a relationship with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) an eager border enforcer; and Drug Lord Torrez (played by Steve Seagal), none of which will result in anything positive. Even Machete's brother, Padre Cortez (Cheech Marin) isn't immune to what is going on and finds himself in a precarious position. As the violence escalates and the story unfolds, you see an underworld that contains gun totting nurses, a patch wearing Rodriquez, hired assassins, and dirty politicians, not to mention seeing the knife wielding Machete kill several dozen people who stand in the way of vengeance or justice.So before passing judgment on the movie, I suggest you just give it a chance. Challenge yourself to look beyond the stereotypes, violence and other things that on the surface are disturbing, and take it for what it is....a story about wrongs being made right, and good overcoming evil. I highly recommend this movie, and think most will enjoy it.

It was a struggle for me to review this book because there were things that I liked about the story, but there were a bunch of things that I didn't like. I struggle between giving the book a 2.5 and a 3. I feel the underlying plot was good (abuse, racism, sister with issues, husband who cheats with sister, motorcycle lover for sister, amputee, evil deceased grandmother and a host of other interesting characters), but I think there were times when the long, graphic sex scenes, could have been eliminated in order to have build better character development, instead of throwing it in during the last few chapters in the book. I think the novel would have been better if we were allowed to see why the husband felt he was "addicted" to sex (all we THINK we know is that he had an absent father and a dead mother)and if the "wife's" issues (she doesn't appear to enjoy sex)would have been clear before the last two chapters of the book. (Hey, you knew she had issues, you just didn't know what the cause of them were. However, when they were revealed, it seemed rushed and confusing.) Maybe if Dickey had used the last few chapters to be the beginning of the book, and built on that, through a series of flashbacks, it would have been a smoother read.Overall, I am not sure that I would recommend this book to anyone, but if you were to pick it up and read it on your own OK. I only read it because it was my bookclub's selection.

Samir Horn (Cheadle) is a Sudan born Muslim (raised and trained in the US) who appears to have terrorist ties, or at least in the beginning to be some kind of dealer in explosives. Following his arrest and escape, we aren't really sure whose side Horn is on. How he struggles with his religious beliefs and his alliance to his country becomes central to the story. What I came to appreciate about this movie was portray of Horn as he struggled with his moral and religious convictions, and it is the dichotomy between these issues made for an interesting movie.I feel that Cheadle did a wonderful job with this role and anyone could benefit from watching this movie.

Like his other novels, Hardwick weaves a tale like no other. This novel is filled with deceptions, betrayals, and good old fashion mysteries. I enjoyed it and I think you will too. It is especially interesting if you have ever been to Detroit and enjoy learning about the inner workings of politics and government.

"Dark Dreams" is a wonderful collection of horror and suspense novels by African American writers. I was familiar with some of the authors, and pleasantly pleased by those that I wasn't. Each story offered something supernatural, from vampires to ghouls....from the strange to the mundane. There are stories spread throughout time, from slavery... to modern day... to the future. Regardless, there is enough variety for everyone. My two favorites were: Terence Taylor's Plaything and Steven Barnes & Tananarive Due's Danger Word. Both are provocative, extremely well written (with an air of foreboding and suspense), thought provoking and left me feeling unsettled hours later.Resident Evil 3Imagine that your landlord is a horny vamp who changes beautiful women in sex slaves (vamps) at will and has no intentions of stopping. I would have liked more. It was typical Zane (full of sex) but I thought that there could have been a little more of the story. Not to mention it ended abruptly.But Beautiful & Terrifying 3.5Japanese women are being mutilated and killed during the war. Who or what is using the war to cover up their crimes? I enjoyed the atmosphere of the story....it was wartime, in a foreign county, not to mention the underlying current of racism and prejudice against African Americans who were serving in the armed forces. Personally, while I understood that this was a short story, I would have liked more.He who Takes Away the Pain 3When a phantom visits those struck with small pox or other illnesses, he takes away the pain. Woven with religion, and undertones of wrath, this story is more suspenseful than terrifying. When, where and who will the mystery man visit next?Bras Coupe 3This story was intriguing and had tons of potential. Just where it fell short for me, I am not sure. A white accountant wonders and tries desperately to fit in with people that are a mystery to him, questions everything when he is faced with the bizarre situation in New Orleans. Will he stand his ground or run?Hair Dreams 3Zaszou, an unattractive woman saves or rather collects hair from trash cans & bathrooms. She's saving up, for "new hair". But when someone tries to take advantage of her, she fights for her life and does the unthinkable.....and is soon transformed into a pretty white girl.The Track 3What happens when you become disenchanted with your wife because she has put on a few pounds? What happens if the only way for her to achieve her goal, of losing weight, is to sacrifice you? When making a resolution is only the beginning...If the Walls Could Talk 3.5Written by one of my favorite writers (LA Banks), "If the Walls Could Talk" was among my favorite stories. What if you had the power to punish a man (who you felt wronged you) for an eternity...allowing him to come out (of the walls) only when you deem he has served his sentence, would you? Would you consider the consequences?The Forth Floor 2.5A man takes pride in his work, and remembers his humble beginnings. Pushing a mop has never been so satisfying.Empty Vessel 3.5A slave seeks the ultimate revenge when she's wronged. Oleander cake anyone? There was tons of potential in this story, but I would have liked a little more.I, Ghoul 4What if you aren't exactly what you seem, and have a hunger for flesh? It's not your fault if your master instilled in your insatiable hunger, that even years later you are unable to satisfy.Dreads 3The story of what happens when your mother keeps your hair braided to keep the voices (spirits) in, but your friends taunt you into letting "them" out.Plaything 5This story was one of the most disturbing and oddly enough my favorite. The setting seemed to be slightly futuristic. The story was of a gay attorney who is defending a pedophile. However, he isn't the traditional pedophile, but one who orders and uses dolls (that act, feel and look human) to fulfill his fantasy. These are dolls, do they have the same rights as human victims? When his beliefs (in the criminal justice system and the right to a fair trial) clash with his beliefs of right and wrong, what happens? This story in and of itself made the entire book worth reading. The ethical and moral dilemmas that Cole faces, as well as how handling this case effects his life are thought provoking.The Power 3.5The tale of what happens when your grandma has someone trying to hurt her because of an old love. Well, if you are two loving, powerful granddaughters, you create a gris-gris for her protection.Red 3.5What happens if you awaken with no real memories, and the ones that you have are extremely violent? And what if the man that you're with seems larger than life and that you are about to marry, keeps referring to humans as food? You become what you have forgotten you are.Siren Song 3A man with a drinking problem, also has a friend who happens to be a siren. All he has to do to get his pieces of gold, to buy his liquor, is provide the siren with what she needs...victims.Granddad's Garage 4Your grandfather dies and leaves you a garage full of priceless, autographed books. You are amazed that he trusts you with such a precious gift.White Chocolate 4When a couple visits Brazil, the wife returns home having learned the ability to change people into "cookies", that she then keeps in the freezer for safe keeping.Cum Onn, It's Lovely Whether 3A demon, a ghost and Christmas. What more could you ask for?The Gray Riders 3.5A gang-banger who fears nothing, but once shot, is visited by an old friend (his imaginary childhood companion, a cowboy). As reality and fantasy blend, you wonder yet know his fate.Danger Word 5An apocalyptic tale of man and his grandson's attempts at evading people infected by the Zombie virus. Having lost his parents, and knowing the dangers that exist, the "Little Soldier" clings to his grandfather who came to his rescue. But when a twist of fate changes all, he must run for his life. The danger word is the only thing that SHOULD save him.Overall, I think this collection deserves a 4. I was entertained, a little spooked and some of the works were extremely thought provoking. I also think "Dark Dreams" will allow you a brief glimpse into the writing style of the various authors which will help you decide if you want to read some of their other works.

I must admit that I initially bought this book for the JD Robb short story about Eve and Roarke, two characters that I have come to love reading about,and if you are a lover of the "In Death series", you won't be disappointed. However, I am happy to say that I really enjoyed the other three short stories, all of which were by authors that I had never heard of, but am seriously considering seeking some of their other works, especially Susan Plunkett.The first short story, "A Berry Merry Christmas", was probably not my favorite of the four, but I enjoyed it immensely. It was about a clumsy, yet good natured elf, named Holly, who is having trouble doing anything right. So imagine her delight when "Mr. C" (AKA Santa) gives her an opportunity to redeem herself by helping complete a seemingly easy task before Christmas, and she doesn't intend to fail and believes that even she is up for the challenge. Afterall, how hard could it be to bring happiness to a young orphan, who has lost everything in a fire, the result of faulty christmas lights (Natalie) and her lonely uncle, Drew? Will this holiday bring magic,joy and love to all?In the "The Unexpected Gift" by Dee Holmes, a recently divorced woman, Sabrina, finds her ex-lover, bad boy Zach, in her yard, apparently suffering from a night of "fun". Will this holiday season find these lovers rediscovering each other, or will their fears prevent it?What happens when an ex-lover returns to find out why you stopped loving him? In Susan Plunkett's "Christmas Promises", you find out what regret, pain and secrets can do to a relationship. After four years with no explanation, Jake feels that the least that Marne can do is talk with him and tell him why she broke her Christmas promise. While battling their own individual demons, they try to locate a traumatized young girl. Marne has to decide if her past will haunt her forever, or allow Jake back into her heart.And finally, in JD Robb's Midnight in Death, Eve Dallas is being pulled away from the holiday festivites to locate a crazed killer who she once caught. What more can she handle after trying to find the perfect gift for a man who has everything and owns most of the planet, her sexy husband, Roarke. As usual, a serial killer in 2059 New York is not easy to find, especially if he is systematically destroying everyone who he feels is responsible for his incarceration. And wouldn't you know, he intends to save the best, Eve, for last.I definately enjoyed these short stories and recommend them to anyone who wants something quick and entertaining to read.

Woven throughout this familiar tale of Camelot and King Arthur are new twists/variations that should appeal to most, even if you aren't familiar with the various versions of the story. Of course those who are familiar will recognize the central characters: Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton), King Arthur (Jamie Bower), Lady Igraine (Claire Forlani), and Merlin (Joseph Fiennes). But there are some new characters: Arthur's brother Kay (Peter Mooney) and his betrayed champion, Leontes (Philip Winchester). There are the familiar themes of: sibling rivalry (one the illegitimate/reluctant ruler, and the other an ambitious vixen), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, sprinkled with tons of jealousy, betrayal and treachery; but there are new twists as well. Merlin isn't the stereotypical "magic-using" wizard, but instead comes across as a tortured/soul searching sorcerer but who is frightened of his own power , but who has grand ideas of rebuilding a nation, and creating a King. Merlin, driven to sometimes do the wrong thing for the right reasons, is perhaps the most endearing character in the entire series. Actor Joseph Fiennes brings a vulnerability to the role that I thought was unique. He could brood, pout, rant and rave, and yet you sympathize with him because he doesn't trust himself to use his power for fear that he will not be able to control himself. And while Bower doesn't exactly invoke the King Arthur image at first glance, he does bring a certain recklessness to the role that was refreshing. He's rash, impetuous, makes tons of mistakes, and does things without thinking of the consequences, but yet you still sympathize with his character because underneath it all you realize that he, although a King, is human too. He merely wants to belong and be loved, even if that means trusting unconditionally a half-sister who means him harm. Eva Green's portrayal of Morgan (Arthur's half sister) is chilling, and while she comes across as evil and dastardly, she does show us moments of vulnerability that evoke sympathy. You still dislike her, but you do understand her. And finally, one of the most subtle and endearing characters in the story (besides Merlin) is Leontes, whose faith (in God) and moral compass makes the viewer cheer for him with the hope that he will escape his fate (spoiler...which he doesn't). Leontes' betrayal shows you just how there can be tension between duty, honor and forgiveness.Now a critique of the story, which has been done but I will put my spin on it. Young Arthur was raised by a family who did not tell him of his royal heritage, but yet he grows up spoiled and inconsiderate. He takes what he wants, when he wants. Up until this point, Arthur has gone thru life recklessly, and yet with this new responsibility he appears to be maturing. His saving grace is his (adopted) brother who loves him unconditionally but also recognizes his weaknesses and forgives him. Anyway, when King Uther (who has battled his own demons...lust for a woman that wasn't his and loathing for a daughter who wants to be loved) dies , Merlin comes calling demanding that Arthur take his rightful place on the throne. The only problem is that Uther's exhiled daughter, Morgan Pendragon, feels hurt and betrayed and believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne, especially since she went thru all the trouble to use sorcery and magic to poison him. She has been making her own alliances, building her own army, all while assuming that she will be Britian's new ruler. The question is what price will she pay for the magic she uses to manipulate and control those around her? She doesn't intend to let Merlin (a sorcerer who afraid to use his power) or her illegitimate half-brother Arthur to stand in her way. The viewer will enjoy the tension that exists between Merlin and his power. While initially he appears noble, at times he is misguided, and while his intentions are good, his actions don't always reflect that. He constantly struggles not to give into his urges and desires. Instead he wants to unite a kingdom, under one ruler and return Camelot to its original glory. There are some other interesting plots in the series, but you will have to watch it for yourself.What I enjoyed most about this story was the underlying theme (while not new) that everything is not as it seems). People can be fooled (literally and figuratively) into making poor decisions, especially if it is something that they want or desire (Morgan as Lady Ingraine....Morgan as a girl...Morgan as Guinevere). I also enjoyed the explanation of how certain myths and tales were embellished to foster hope and kinship. The storyteller also took several creative liberties and changed reintroduced the various myths that we thought we knew (the lady in the lake and the sword in the stone). The only thing that I wished to see was a change in the role of Guinevere. While Egerton is incredibly beautiful, I thought that they could have done so much more with her character. She was the typical Guinevere, beguiling and yet we knew she would yield to temptation. While on the surface she appears/pretends to be noble and strong, she also comes across as fickle and confused about what she really wants. After all, she is attracted to Arthur, and yet feels an obligation to marry Leontes (who she has dated since childhood), only to later betray him.Although there was nothing too-too original about this adaptation of the traditional story of King Arthur, there were a few new nuances that enhance the story, not to mention some decent actors, who work well with the material they were given. There are a few slow parts, but overall there are enough fight and love scenes that kept the story moving. The DVD also offered some extras that included bloopers and interviews with the actors. At the end of the day, I don't regret those hours that I spent watching the show and the good parts (scenery, acting, etc) definitely outweighed the bad/slow parts. This version of Camelot definitely is worth watching as a marathon on a Sunday.

This is not my first Kellerman/Delaware/Sturgis novel and therefore, I was able to appreciate the style and plot. We see Sturgis and Delaware reinvestigating a case that they thought they had closed 8 years earlier. When one defendant (one of the juveniles who had killed the toddler) is released and turns up dead, the hunt is on for who is responsible for all of the crimes and why? But first, they must discover "Why the toddler was killed", and who is behind the new crimes. We see the dynamic duo, Delaware and Sturgis plow through their normal methods to discover the killer. The only thing that I did not enjoy was the continuing struggle between Robin,Allison and Alex. I have grown tired of the "I still love Robin, but she left me and I am trying to make it with Allison, who thinks I am exciting until my detective work comes too close to her". I think it is time for Kellerman to take a stand in that relationship, which he appears to be doing at the end, and find some resolution. But all in all, I enjoyed it.

"Judge & Jury" by James Patterson's is yet another collaboration with Andrew Gross. The two once again team up for a quick and easy suspense novel. Meet Andie DeGrasse, a single mother/struggling actress who has been called as a potential juror in the highly publicized trial of Mafia Don Dominic Cavello. Tracked down and brought to justice by a dedicated FBI Agent, Nick Pellisante, Cavello is preparing for his trial, which is turning into the trial of the century. Unfortunately, Cavello doesn't intend to go down without a fight, or plan to serve any serious time in prison, and orchestrates something that will live in the minds of those determined to bring him down, for the rest of their lives. Bent on revenge and dishing out their own idea of justice, Andie and Nick set out to bring down the man that has caused so many people to lose their lives.This book was quick and easy to read. It is not as well thought out and executed as some of Patterson's early works, but it isn't as bad as some of his other collaborations. Getting it from a friend and reading it just as something light between your heavy reading, would be fine.

One of the most action packed, heart stopping, most enjoyable novels that I have read in years. If you want to read about the underworld, and really understand the layers of hell, all the while experiencing a love story, the Awakening is the novel for you. This novel picks up where the story where the 1st one left off. You have the continuing story of the struggle for the Master Vamp Carlos' soul, while enjoying the build up the eventual love story with Damali. And at the end, you are on the edge of your seat waiting for more. Hey, and I've already read part three and it leaves you wanting for more.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the leader of a Special Forces unit and much like Hannibal in "the A Team" (I definitely see why there are comparisons made), he has a heart of gold underneath a very tough exterior. Anyway, while saving a group of children, his unit is betrayed by "Max" (a super bad guy). Following the leads where they go.....including to a very sexy and very mysterious Zoe Saldana, Clay sets out to find the truth and soon even he realizes that everything is not as it seems, and that the puppeteer may be closer than he initially thought. I thought that this was a great action/adventure movie. There were good guys/bad guys, a team of kick butt soldiers (Rogue, Pooch, Jensen and Cougar), a little romance, a lot of fight scenes, and twists and turns (with the plot). I also had no idea that this story was based on a comic book so that was a bonus. So, for a weekend flick....if you don't want anything too deep and dark, this is the flick for you. Especially if you enjoy Jeffrey Morgan, who I think is a decent actor but who seems to die in every movie or TV show that I have seen him in (for example, Supernatural, Grey's Anatomy, and Watchmen). And don't fear, he doesn't die in this one. I wonder will there be a sequel?

Imagine if you could see the last 18 seconds of a person's life. Would you see who they loved? Would you see some regret, some long wished thought? Or would you see who killed them and why? Sherry Moore has this gift (the ability to see the last 18 seconds of your life) following a childhood trauma that left her blind and unable to remember anything before she was discovered at an orphanage. Since she discovered her gift, she has felt compelled to help families and police departments solve some difficult cases. As two detectives (Payne and O'Shaughnessey), in different jurisdictions (Wildwood and Philadelphia) attempt to solve two seemingly unrelated murders, they soon find that everything is connected, from a vehicular homicide that occurred 30 years before, to a recent abduction of a young teen.Lieutenant Kelly O'Shaughnessy (daughter of the late Detective O'Shaughnessy) is struggling to repair her marriage or move on; gain and keep the respect of her fellow co-workers; prove herself to doubters; and open her mind to new investigative techniques (Sherry) while solving some very puzzling abductions. John Payne, a dedicated and honorable Philadelphia Detective knows the advantages to using Sherry's talents in an effort to get the bad guy, but there is one problem, he is falling in love with her. Then there's the killer who we can only assume was born evil, but who has a memory and a plan for those he feels lead to his capture (which of course wasn't for his serial killing activities, but a horrific bus tragedy where he killed over 15 kids while under the influence of drugs). Released on early parole, and presumed harmless (because he's dying of a rare form of cancer), Sykes is out or prison and victimizing young women at will. And finally, there is sweet, now mildly retarded Jeremy Smyles who was a casualty of the traffic accident that occurred 30 years prior. All of these individuals will intersect in a final showdown scripted by Sykes.What I liked about the novel was the way that the writer incorporated what happened 30 years prior, to the events occurring today. Sykes actions, known and unknown, would lead to a series of events where others involved in the drama, didn't necessarily know or understand their roles but the reader did. What I didn't like was the quick and easy ending. For most of the novel, there was a lot of buildup, only to rush the ending meaning there could have been more. But, overall I enjoyed the story. It was a short and easy read. I only wished things had worked out differently for some of the characters, but perhaps what happened made the story more realistic. Although getting the bad guys should be enough, the reader realizes that in the long run, there are costs.

I guess I am going through my paranormal phase and picked up Dark Celebration last week. While reading it, I realized that I have read Dark Demon, the back story to Natalya and Vikirnoff. Although they are a small part in the Dark Celebration storyline, I enjoyed remembering this book and thought "what the heck, give a brief review". But because this book has been reviewed by tons of people, I will give only a brief outline and let readers make their minds up for themselves :).Natalya Shonski, vampire hunter/slayer/dragonseeker/independent woman meets sexy/honorable/warrior, Vikirnoff. And although he is a bossy Carpathian (similar to a vampire but good) she falls head over boots for him. The thing that I found interesting is some of the Carpathian history, although it is still not really clear to me....apparently, Carpathians are similar to vampires, or can become a vampire if they do not find lifemates to bring back feelings and emotions. Apparently after years, centuries even of protecting their species, they can be pulled into darkness (evil) if they do not discover their mates. So while fighting evil (vampires), turning into a tiger (with bands of color in her hair), struggling with her mage powers (kind of like a sorcerer), discovering her dragonseeker powers, and fighting her attraction to Vikirnoff, she and her "lifemate" get into tons of fights, which have apparently been started by her evil twin brother.Anyway, Dark Demon is entertaining, and I didn't think all that bad, and if pushed I would give it a 3.5.

Imagine my surprise when I realized that I had not written a review about one of the most "under-recognized" novels that I have found. Most people know LA Banks from her Soul Food series, but they do not know that she is a "sci-fiction" writer. Ms. Banks first installment is wonderful and builds the future for a terrific series.

Imagine agreeing to participate in a harmless experiment only to find that it isn't at all what you thought. Well, one lady and 3 guys agree to and find themselves in more trouble than they could ever imagine. While on the surface, they should be suspicious, the promise of $25 dollars an hour proves to be more of a lure than a deterrent. So we are not surprised that after being escorted into a sterile looking white room, given a survey to complete, their personal possessions taken, and then being locked in a room, that the participants begin to see that maybe they have made a mistake. A young eager female profiler has been picked to observe and analyze those things that break people psychologically. Apparently this program's sole goal is to create people who will be suicide bombers for the government. So when the main examiner, shoots the female participant and challenges the remaining/surviving participants to answer questions to save their lives, they find that what was a sure thing, may not be. What will break them and who will eventually be deemed worthy will not surprise you, but the utter lack of depth in the characters will definitely disappoint. What could have worked and really been a decent movie, failed because it did not execute. I wouldn't recommend this movie if you want something truly suspenseful. Instead rent some oldie but goodies like "The Usual Suspects", "Identity" or something with some real grit. This however was extremely disappointing, almost as much as Vin Diesel's Babylon AD.

If you enjoy a wonderful sequel to a classic movie and TV show, you will enjoy this the latest installment of the Incredible Hulk. There are a few changes in this latest movie...Liv Tyler now plays the love interest; William Hurt plays the General; and Edward Norton now plays the tortured Dr. Bruce Banner. There is the same old theme of a tormented Dr. Banner trying to cure himself (i.e., by using calming techniques taught to him and by sending data to a professor at the University) while trying to elude his nemesis General Ross (who is still trying to capture and control the Hulk), and rekindling a romance with Betty (Ross' daughter). The new additions to the story is the angry, power hungry soldier, Emil Blonsky who Ross' is willing to experiment on to insure that he has someone who can rival the Hulk. Blonsky doesn't mind being experimented on if it means that he will have super strength. He feels the power already.While there are some cheesy moments (cameos of both a deceased Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, not to mention the creator of Marvel Comics), over all I think this movie was extremely enjoyable, and I think Norton ended up being a decent Hulk. He definitely looks and acts tortured. And the lesson is clear, you can continue to fight the rage inside you or you can learn to control and use it. But more importantly, the movie sets the tone for future Hulk movies and future storylines...the Doctor helping Banner I think could be the Doctor with the large cranium from the comic books/cartoons, not to mention Banner's continued search for a cure. Or maybe at least we will discover if Banner ever learns to control his beast.

Now I will take exception to the comparison to Anita Blake that some reviewers are making. I ASOLUTELY HATE the Anita Blake Series...see some of my reviews. I think Mrs. Arthur's plot is way better than Mrs. Hamilton's. I know that some will hate me for my comment but it is the truth.First I think this book was extremely easy to read and follow. I read it in 2 days...and that is saying a lot because I have two kids, but it was Christmas break.The plot is simple...Rhoan is missing and his twin, half-breed (half werewolf, half vampire= dhampire)sister Riley senses that he is in trouble...while finding herself in trouble because it is almost a full moon, that time of the month that she demands sexual satisfaction. While unraveling the plot behind, her brothers capture and a half-naked vampire who she found on her doorstep, and handling two lovers, she finds herself continuously in danger. You can read it, there is so much more and for a first novel, I think Arthur has set the stage for several sequels to come. When the story evolves (much quicker than those Hamilton novels where you have to stomach sex for the sake of sex) you find that someone (I have made a guess who it will eventually turn out to be) but wishes to make the perfect race of hybrids. There is of course, a plot within a plot (one of her lovers was her pregnant with the "perfect" werewolf...he doesn't realize that she is a halfbreed)....but there are "secret agencies to police the paranormal", secret experiments, and a very old vampire with a broken heart. While the rescue of her brother appears to be the goal of the novel, we soon learn that perhaps what the "secret" puppeter wants is something greater, perhaps Riley herself. I think future novels will answer a lot of questions and hopefully resolve the issues between Riley and Quinn (the vampire who desires her, but won't risk another broken heart). Hopefully, Arthur will make the next better than the first.

I really enjoyed this collection of short stories, by some talented authors. Although I found some stories needed more or to be longer, I enjoyed each of them.The Ultimate Diet - Overweight woman acts as a Peeping Tom when it comes to her thinner, mysterious neighbor how turned out to be a vampire. One could only guess how she stays so thin.Vamp Noir - A female enforcer, who uses her charms and powers for the MOB, but wants more than anything to be loved.Human Heat - A handsome Creole man who has become addicted to "virgin" blood.Whispers During Still Moments - A half human-half vampire who is using his newly acquired powers to defeat "vampires", in an effort to "heal or cure" himself. But now, while trying to eradicate what he is soon becoming, he has to save his love.The Touch - A vampire is looking for her soulmate.Family Business - A woman learns that "Monsters" can be (1) her abusive husband or (2) his vamp male lover, but not necessarily her own family who are "werewolves".If you would like some interesting reading, for some unusual perspectives, by some talented authors, this is the novel for you.

Hank Thompson has come full circle!Along with the evolution of the series, we have seen the character of "Hank Thompson" grow and develop into a character that we can all cheer for, sympathize with and love. We all embrace the belief that Hank is just a man caught up in the circumstances of a life that he didn't necessarily want. We have seen him evolve from a promising baseball player (Caught Stealing), to a man on the run (Six Bad Things), to a pill popping Mob enforcer with poorly done facial reconstruction (A Dangerous Man), and now he is back in New York where it all started with his babysitting a friend's cat. Asked by his employer to protect a new investment (an up and coming baseball star, Miguel, who reminds Hank of himself), he finds his ugly past and $4 million dollar mistake coming back to haunt him. While Hank is doing everything possible to protect his newly relocated parents from harm, he also realizes that he is in yet again another "damned if he does, damned if he doesn't situation". He can either protect his family by doing what his employer wants or he can buck the system and do the right thing (by showing Miguel, who has so much potential and promise, how his gambling will become his downfall and endear him to people who aren't necessarily looking out for his best interest). And oh, there is still that problem of the missing $4 million dollars.I thought that this was a wonderfully poignant conclusion to a wonderful trilogy. The epilogue was so well written that I found myself torn, that although I found peace with Hank's fate, I wanted so much more for him. Hank, was never truly bad, just caught up in circumstances beyond his control, making him perhaps the biggest victim of all. What I really enjoy about Hurston's writing style is his ability to weave in tragedy with hope and triumph, while investing the reader in the outcome and making them feel ok with whatever it is.Although I would have preferred another ending for Hank, it was the most realistic. I hate to see the series end, but with other potential stories trapped in Hurston's head, this will definitely not be the last word from this very talented author. I can't wait to read his next body of work. And if you enjoyed this series, try Shotgun Rule and the Joe Pitt series. They are all a tall glass of refreshing water!

Now, the only reason that I read this novel, or gave it a 3 was because of JD Robb's Interlude in Death. THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.Interlude in Death, by JD Robb was just what I have grown to love and expect...a wonderful read about Eve and Roarke. In this story, Eve has been asked to speak at a conference "off" planet by her Commander, Whitney. So on top of hating "space" travel, she has to solve the mystery of who killed someone she slugged hours before. It appears that someone has an axe to grind with her husband, and they aren't too particular about her as well. You will simply love as she weaves her way through an investigation with a sexy police chief who works for Roarke. This short story definately was worth a 10, hence my 3 rating. WONDERFUL.Kinsman, by Susan Krinard was well.....had potential, but just seemed to fall flat. Two telepaths work together, one with the hope that she will locate her missing brother (and his ship), and the other hopes that she will have his child. The only thing, one of them has lost his abilities because of an accident that killed his late wife. Will he find love? Will she find her brother? Why is this story so...lacking in, maybe it is plot? Didn't make me want to go out and get another one of her books, that's for sure. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.Immortality, by Maggie Shayne had potential, but ended up flat as well. A witch is drowned, or rather reincarnated to......not really sure why she was reincarnated. While pregnant, she dies in a fire that she set (I think)to pay back her cheating husband and his lover. OK. So she wakes to a man (a couple of centuries later)who has also lost a wife and child. Will she fall in love with the handsome stranger? And while she waits to see, there are a host of other subplots occurring (a storm, his wife's death, etc), that makes the story less enjoyable. OK.Magic Like Heat Across My Skin, by Laurell K. Hamilton was the most disappointing. If you read my other reviews you know that I do not like Laurell K. Hamilton, but I was willing to give her another chance. Initially, I thought ok, this is going to be interesting, and MAYBE I see why everyone likes her. But that was it, I was so disappointed. The characters that I didn't like from the later books, are present and I should have liked them more because they provided some background, but I didn't. I am still sick of Richard and Jean-Claude, and most of all Anita (who isn't Buffy, or close to it). JUST PLAIN DUMB.So, while I read it for JD Robb, I could have done without the other stories, but you know I am a fool for a book and read it. But if you can, don't purchase, just borrow from the library.
