I keep hearing all these wonderful reviews of Wishmaster, but in all truthfulness, I think it's their worst album yet. It has a really commercial sound, like they were attempting to sell out with it (fortunately, they changed directions for the better with Century Child) and it was a huge disappointment after Oceanborn. I know I'm gonna take a beating for saying this, but Tarja's vocals kill half the songs; she sounds good if she can fit her voice into the music, but on a lot of the songs on here, she goes one way and the music goes another. And what in the hell were they thinking when they made "Kinslayer"? The guy on there just talks and Tarja sounds pathetic. Also, the lyrics are totally unimaginative in contrast to their other works. This is power metal; power metal is cheesy by nature, but there are some bands (Sonata Arctica, Nightwish) who can make it sound good, but only in rare cases. In the end, it's all a matter of taste, but this almost sounds like Dream Theater on speed with a chick behind the microphone, and I can't stand DT for the most part. It has good points, but just not enough to hold the album up to par with Nightwish's other material. I really didn't want to give it only 3 stars, but this one just didn't appeal all that much to me.

Wow... I have just played this masterpiece through and I have never heard a more atmospheric black metal album. It is the coldest, most desolate-sounding piece I have ever been witness to. It makes Agalloch sound like summer beach tunes, and makes Dimmu Borgir and Children of Bodom sound like carnival clowns (wait... they sound like carnival clowns anyway). Varg blew away anything by his friends in Darkthrone with this album. I didn't think it could get much better than his "Burzum/Aske" LP + EP, but I'm inclined to say this one is. The opener "Det Som en Gang Var" is pure brilliance, while the closing "Tomhet" has a beautifully grim aura to it. The other two songs are masterfully executed as well, and fit in properly between the two longer songs. I highly recommend this to any fan of good music.

The music critics that hail Serj Tankian as a great thinker and poet must have a brain about the size of a peanut. This is supposed to be poetic and socially-conscious? Well, sure the system isn't perfect, but if they hate it so much, they are more than free to go back to whatever third-world pit they came from. All they're doing is making absolutely awful &quot;music&quot; with no orchestration, minimal talent, and stupid lyrics. Okay, so there are three or four songs that are listenable. The rest is just noise. Nothing more, nothing that a fifth-grader couldn't do. This is the epitome of why nu-metal is a gargantuan load of defecation. It's music by drug fiends, for drug fiends, in a similar vein as rap is. The American music industry is all too willing to shove garbage like this down people's throats, but they never give any kind of attention to talented bands, even American artists like Iced Earth. No, we have to listen to three idiots yelling and screaming over shambled noise about why they hate the government and why their lives are a waste. And there are people out there who find this to be good music. That's what I call closed-mindedness and poor taste. I'm all for people's choice in music, but I honestly don't understand what one can find entertaining about this horse dung.

Borknagar's first album is all in Norwegian, which is cool because you can't understand a word they're saying if you don't speak the language. So, for anyone who's easily offended by lyrics, no worries mate! Of course, Borknagar's material supposedly deals with nature, which is a topic I like to hear about, so I can't understand how you would be. Anyway, if you started listening to Borknagar with Quintessence or Empiricism, this is vastly different, but gives a hint as to where the music would eventually go. It's not underground black metal void of synths or rhythm; the production isn't great but isn't as bad as some reviewers are saying, and is much better than early Emperor. The guitar work is excellent; Garm's vocals are good, but probably the worst of the three vocalists the band has been through over the course of its existence; and in typical black metal fashion, the drums really stand out. This is melodic metal, so don't expect anything brutal or evil. It's just plain good music. Get it now before they run out of copies. I hear it's out of production and will not be available much longer, but I don't know how true that is.

I won't take any more than one star away from this movie for all its faults, because in the end, it's still a very good and entertaining viewing experience. The 'Hollywood effect' is, however, unfortunately present. They do too much with the love story between the American fighter pilot and the Japanese girl, which is okay to draw the popular crowd audience, but for those people, the second half of the movie would seem pointless, even if that IS the important part. I'll also agree with the reviewers that said that the material sampling is WAY overdone. Obviously, the filmmakers had nowhere near the budget of "Tora Tora Tora," so a lot of scenes from that movie were thrown in, and there is a lot of actual combat footage. Now, nothing against the actual combat footage, but it does add a level of disparity to the film. There were quite a few airworthy F4Fs, TBMs and SBDs available at the time, so they could've done the scenes with the actual aircraft types and not had to contend with the level of visual differences.The "English-speaking Japanese" feature is also a big Hollywood turnoff. However, it makes it easier for people who need reading glasses to read the subtitles! It does take away from the realism, though. The filmmakers did paint the portrait of the Japanese as good fighters and not savages, which I liked. But there were some questionable points when comparing this to "Tora Tora Tora." For example, in the latter film, the filmmakers led us to believe that the relationship between Adm. Nagumo and Cdr. Genda was less than warm and cozy, but in this film, they're like best buddies and have nothing but praise for each other's ideas and tactics. There are also some differences in Nagumo's character. In "Tora Tora Tora," he's portrayed as very cautious, not taking any risks that would endanger his fleet. This film does portray him as the fine commander that he was, but also seems to indicate that he was more bold and even somewhat reckless.Overall, however, for all of its faults, "Midway" is a good film. Yes, it's more romanticized than "Tora Tora Tora" and was meant for a more mainstream audience, but it is still an adequately accurate depiction of one of the most important battles of WWII. In a sense, it's a shame that future filmmakers will never be able to make a film about an epic Naval battle again. Warfare has devolved into a more sanguine "civilized nation"-vs.-terrorist deal, with no honor, no heroes, and no sanctity for those fallen.The verdict: Buy this film, but don't expect a picture that's all about the action. It's comparable in a way to the recent film "Pearl Harbor," except far more on-topic and much less concerned with wooing the audience. But it won't be one of those films where you'll think to yourself, "I want those two hours of my life back."

Aside from its less-than-fantastic production, which is easy to overlook, Kamelot's Epica is a wonderful trip through a world beyond human realization. Roy Khan's vocals, coupled with some good female vocalists, are the icing on the cake formed by great guitar work and mind-blowing musical compositions. The opening full-length track and the last song are the best, making for a spellbinding introduction and powerful closer, while the material held within provides a listening experience that you'll want to relive over and over. Highly recommended to fans of bands like Blind Guardian, Edguy, Iced Earth, Demons &amp; Wizards, Stratovarius, the almighty Symphony X, and other real metal artists!

This in-depth portrayal of the infamous December 7, 1941 attack on the US Navy Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor is possibly one of the most researched and accurate historical films ever produced. It provides a magnificent viewing experience, and despite not having the fancy and exuberant special effects that the recent flick "Pearl Harbor" was filled with, it is possibly the most enjoyable war movie you can watch. Unlike the more recent film, which was undoubtedly directed at today's younger crowd, who (aside from myself and those like me) are less interested in history and more interested in lots of explosions and sweet tender emotions, this film did not blaspheme the attack by turning an account of it into a stupid love story. It's just the politics, strategies, mistakes, and triumphs that made December 7, 1941 the saddest day in American history up until September 11 of 2001.One of the greatest aspects of this film is that it sheds light on the absolute brilliance of the Japanese Naval strategists. Admirals Yamamoto and Nagumo and Commander Genda were three of the greatest military leaders/strategists of World War II, and possibly, of all time. The film presents the attack not as a barbaric act of unprovoked massacre, as most Americans would like to think it was, but rather, as a decisive military move in the better interests of Japan. After all, as (the character who played) Yamamoto stated in the film, the Americans would have been (and proved to be) the most difficult enemy that Japan had ever fought. The attack was basically an act of desperation, as the warmongering Japanese Army, who controlled politics, blatantly rejected the Navy's pleas to avoid a war. I was very happy to see this film treating the brilliant Japanese planners and pilots not as the heartless murderers that many ignorant Americans see them as, but rather as the national heroes that they had become for Japan by acting in what they believed was the best interest of their nation. After all, isn't that how we think of our soldiers? If it isn't, then we need to sit down and examine our conscience.Even without the jazzy special effects, this film recreates the combat scenes very well. Unless you're a computer geek who believes that special effects make a movie and the story line is just there for the hell of it, you won't notice any problem with the explosions and aerial combat. In fact, the replica Japanese aircraft (BT-13s and AT-6s modified to look like A6M 'Zeke' [Zero] fighters, D3A1 'Val' dive bombers, and B5N2 'Kate' torpedo bombers) and American P-40s engaging in actual aerial maneuvering was much more spectacular than if it had been recreated on computer screens. The pyrotechnics used were fantastic as well, and the scene of a B-17 landing with one wheel up was a scene to remember. On a side note, if anyone was ever fortunate enough to catch the Commemorative Air Force's (formerly Confederate Air Force) reenactment of the attack at an air show, they actually had the B-17 "Texas Raiders" crank one wheel down and fly LOW over the runway to recreate that very scene! I'm not sure if they still do that, but that was the kind of thing that made memories!Overall, if you want a truly unbiased account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, without the liberal twist thrown in to make it look like our brass and President were helpless victims instead of revealing the mistakes made by the top levels of our government and armed forces, then you'll love "Tora! Tora! Tora!" I recommend it to anyone with an interest in war movies, military history, naval warfare, aviation, or just plain great movies.

Let me start by saying I'm not disappointed with this album, it'll just never be at the front of my collection. I guess you'd place it somewhere in the vicinity of electronic rock and trance 'metal' (I hate to slander the brilliant genre of metal by allowing relatively easy-listening bands like this to be categorized within it). I've always been skeptical of all-female bands, as in most cases (*cough* Kittie), they've always seemed more interested in sounding &quot;big and bad&quot; and showing up the male bands than with producing quality music. This band doesn't do much to break the habit, as there are relatively few differentiating features between the songs and there is not a whole lot of complexity. Now, it's not a bad formula per se, but it does get very repetitive, and the overdose of electronics ruins things very much. Worst of all, they have a rapper on &quot;Simon Says&quot; - rap has NO place in metal, and if you want to become a legitimate rock/metal band, you must throw away the hip-hop.One thing that really annoyed me about these girls is how much they relied on guest musicians. If Flavia can't play an acoustic guitar, then she should not be a lead guitarist. There is no excuse for having a guest play any guitar part, as guitars are the heart of any rock/metal band. But the electric guitar is pretty good, so I don't want to say the girl has no talent, because the three that play instruments definitely do. Martina Axen (the really hot one) is the one that stands out the most, as I'm partial to good drumming, but all too often, the beats are made on a switchboard or synthesizer instead of on a bass drum. And as far as vocals, well Maria Sjoholm does a good job at not sounding feminine, but sometimes she sounds like she's got a razor in her throat! I don't think she should sound sweet or girly, but she also shouldn't sound like she's on depressants. Bass player Anna K isn't really noticeable.Now, is it totally bad? Definitely not. But it's one of those albums that will appeal to a relatively narrow audience, and I'm not in that particular sect, but hey I tried. And I do like it to a point. I just think it will appeal to fans of music with a heavy electronic presence, such as, say, kidneythieves or Tapping The Vein, and Opeth and Emperor fans will probably look down on it.On a side note, I certainly hope my review gets posted this time; it's the third time I've submitted it!

The downside: Tim Owens stinks compared to Matt Barlow. Too bad Matt left, but it's his life, and I salute him for his choice to pursue a criminal justice degree and wish him the best of luck.The upside: The band is still good. The songs aren't the same without Matt's vocals, and I hate the way-overdone, 80s-style vocals that Ripper has, but it's not enough to kill Schaffer's great work. The new Iced Earth lyrical material will surely not appeal to the European crowd that loves the band so, as Europeans despise American pride (it does get annoying when people boast about being American), but if they concentrate on the music, they'll like it enough. I'm looking forward to a good album by Iced Earth.BTW: I gave this 3 stars for 1) the bad vocals and 2) the fact that I really don't like EPs.

Most Bone fans prefer the old style, but if you ask me, it the old sound seems to be too heavily influenced by Eazy-E, which by my standards isn't a compliment. This is a good album, with a good mix of hard and mellow. I honestly like Bizzy's solo "One Night Stand" best because it reminds me of someone I used to know, so it's a kinda poignant song, not to mention it just plain sounds good. The opening song is good, so is "Battlezone" but I can't stand the drug songs because they both sound corny. "Change The World" is semi-decent, but sounds better in remix form. I love Flesh-n-Bone's verse in "Souljahs Marching." If you like the old style, you probably will only like 4 or 5 songs on here. If you're more open-minded, you'll probably at least give it a rating of "decent."

The critics told me The Gathering was a wonderful band. I bought one of their discs, liked it, but wasn't blown away. Then they said After Forever was simply the greatest thing to grace the music industry. Bought one of their CDs and didn't care much for it. So what did I do? Fell victim to the same lure and bought Within Temptation's "Mother Earth" (albeit not for $43; I got it from Napalm Records for about $18, which is still way more than I should've paid).Let's start with production. The guitars sound like they're synthesized because someone didn't integrate the production layers properly. The guitarists are no different than the ones you'll find in Lacuna Coil; they only really needed one and there aren't any mind-blowing leads. The only musician that really stands out here, aside from the synth guy, is the guest musician they brought in to play the flutes. Now, to everyone's favorite, the vocalist. Sharon den Adel has got to have the most annoying voice I've ever heard this side of The Sins of Thy Beloved. I mean, Anneke van Giersbergen and Floor Jansen did not blow me away like they did everyone else, but at least I could see why a lot of people liked their voices. Listening to Sharon is like shoving a screwdriver into your eardrum. She's whinier than Dani Filth and often gets way off-key (either that or whoever designed the vocal structures did a really bad job). So, should you buy this? If you like Lacuna Coil and Elis, then maybe. There are no male vocals, so it lacks the variety of those two bands, but is on about the same level in terms of accessibility and complexity. I would not call it gothic metal by any means; if anything, it's pop music with some guitars, in the vein of Lullacry but not as heavy. If you're considering buying this album, then you should a) find a website that provides some samples and b) find a place where they sell it for a reasonable price.

I'm going to keep this short and sweet, because I don't play this often enough to do a thorough review. It has many good songs on it, especially the opener and the softer songs, but the lack of a bass guitar and the shabby production are all-too-noticeable. But it's better than Wishmaster, and worlds better than anything you'll find on mainstream.

I tell you, if they would've stuck to the formula they used on this CD, but improved on a few things, I'll bet they'd have made it bigger. But instead, they went synth-pop on Freaks of Nature, and that album sounds more like something you'd hear at a goth club than at a mosh pit. This one wouldn't do at a mosh pit either, but it reminds me (in a way) of a Disturbed album, albeit with much flatter vocals. Being a fan of Disturbed, that's a compliment in a way, except Horror Wrestling is quite repetitive, and I often get the feeling that I'm listening to the same track that just played. However, it's nice and heavy, and there's no overreliance on synth or programming. And there's no rapper on it!Let's put aside the fact that they're all females. All the women want equal rights, so we're not going to give them any leeway just because they possess a uterus, and I'm going to rate it just as I would any album by any artist, regardless of gender, race, nationality, religion, or whatever. I'm basing this on talent, and nothing else. Martina Axen is one hell of a drummer, and although she'll never be anywhere on the level of drumming prodigies like Nick Barker, Criz Mozzati, or Martin Lopez, she makes a big impact on the overall product. Flavia Canel is a decent guitarist at best; as I've stated, the percussion is what makes this album, and the guitar riffs aren't often very strong. Anna Kjellberg's bass guitar is more noticeable on this one than it would be on their next product, but she falls victim to the omnipresent &quot;background bassist&quot; syndrome, as do most bass players. Nevertheless, it wouldn't sound right without her. The only one who doesn't deliver is Maria Sjoholm. Her voice sounds too robotic; she sounds like a drunk zombie and she repeats a lot of patterns. Lyrically, it's just kinda out there; nothing brilliant, but intriguing at times. Production quality is just fine. Recommended, but if you hate nu-metal, don't buy this because it's similar in style.Oh, and to the reviewer who called the genre of metal &quot;lame&quot;: Metallica and Cannibal Corpse aren't the only bands in the genre; the most talented bands in the world (Opeth, Tristania, etc.) aren't rock, they're metal. So do your homework.

Dani and the band come strong with their second album. Not a single weak track plagues this disc, and it includes one of their best openers ever. With Nicholas on the drums and guitarists that actually dominate the music, Cradle of Filth proves that, at one time, they were a true metal band, something that wouldn't resurface until they released Damnation &amp; A Day. All too often throughout the Midian era, they overpowered the music with synthesizers, and while it might have sounded haunting to some, it sounded corny to metalheads. Back in their heyday, the band performed with magnificence, and Dusk &amp; Her Embrace proves it. Buy this album if you love Cradle of Filth.

Cradle of Filth always has the ability to produce great metal, as can be seen in this one. It isn't the band's best work to date, but it is a very good concept album, and since they still had Nicholas Barker, they had a good drummer (and if you read my other reviews, you'll see that I'm anal about drumming). Vocally, well it's your typical Dani Filth. The guitars stand out a lot more than they would in the Midian era, as the band was less reliant on keyboards and synthesizers and actually made metal the way it was meant to be made. The bonus disc has mixed results; the "Lustmord and Wargasm" offering sounds remarkably like the one on the first disc (are they actually the same song with different subtitles?), and the last song is horrible, but the cover of "Hallowed Be Thy Name" is great, although not as good as Iced Earth's cover of the same song. Basically, to put it simply, if you're a Filth fan, get this, but if you're new to the band, get their new one or Dusk & Her Embrace first.

Arjen Anthony Lucassen is such a great musician... or is he? There's nothing about this collection that stands out over and above any other themed power metal album I've heard, aside from Lucassen's continued use of guest vocalists. Well, the one good vocalist he hired, Sir Russell Allen (wow, he's Sir Russell now!), gets probably the least microphone time. And what's this about Floor Jansen sounding good on here? Come on, have you even listened to it? She sounds nothing like she does on After Forever's albums, which I will continue to stress did NOT impress me in the least bit, but on here she sounds like a choking schoolgirl. Dan Swano sounds like a techno synthesizer voice, and Damian Wilson... no comment. As far as lyrics, they seem like they came right out of the novels, which is good, but like the new Iced Earth, they seem to lack any amount of consistency, creativity, or character.Instrumentally, again it's nothing we've never heard before. There are lots of synthesizers, with some cool effects thrown in at times that really help the sci-fi theme, but overall, it's nothing that'll blow your socks off. Arjen isn't that great a guitarist. The drummer isn't bad; thank God he didn't have Dan Swano doing drums. At least Arjen did THAT much right. The bonus track on disc 2 is immature but hilarious. Anyway, if you're a Lucassen fanatic, buy this, but otherwise, sample it first. I didn't and I wish I would've now.

This is sort of a compilation of pre-signing and one-off tracks that Agalloch released as an interim before their stunning masterpiece "The Mantle," and is overall up to the standards of the main discs from the band (their languid EP "The Grey" and the fairly meaningless vinyl "Tomorrow Will Never Come" notwithstanding). The first track is sort of similar to something you'd hear on "Pale Folklore," albeit with a more doom-metalish feel. There's some pretty great guitar work on this track, along with very dismal lyrics. "Foliorum Viridium" is a synth piece, a little short but astoundingly beautiful. They did a nice cover of Sol Invictus' "Kneel to the Cross," which is a lot better than the original, and synth man Breyer ends it off beautifully with a fantastic rendition of a poem by William Butler Yeats, therein proving that he is about 65 million times more talented a vocalist than Haughm. The weak spot comes in track 3, "Haunting Birds," which sounds like a first-jam reference piece. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but the guitar work is not precise at all, and it's not a complex piece at all. It's just the usual few-chords Agalloch atmospheric instrumental, but the off-timing gets irritating. Still, it has a strangely attractive aura to it.So my advice is to get this thing just for the two synth pieces. You're gonna have a hard time finding it though.

Reroute To Remain may not be In Flames' best album ever, but it by no means makes them sellouts. Yes, there is a difference in this album compared to The Jester Race, and the aforementioned album is light years better, but The Jester Race is one of the best melodic death metal albums of all time, and In Flames' style has changed considerably since that album's release. The change wasn't for the better, but the band has not gone down the drain, and for my money, never will. The originators of the Gothenborg sound put in a commendable performance that is not to be overlooked in these 'Fourteen Songs of Conscious Insanity.'Some would have you believe that this is just nu-metal with extreme vocals. To the untrained listener, that may seem to be the case, but there are very important points these critics tend to overlook. In Flames has not turned itself into a raprock band, as many nu-metal acts have. There is no reliance on electronics. The band is perfectly happy creating their music with guitars and drums. And the lyrics make sense; as always, In Flames delivers one of the best lyrical performances in metal, not just the angst-driven cliches brought forth by the 'artists' that drench us in the quagmire of nu-metal. In Flames, no matter how much they've changed over the course of their career, will always be a band true to the genre of metal, and they are NOT sellouts. RTR is a great album that I'd recommend to anyone who has already gotten into the band.

Okay, yes there are a buttload of one-star reviews, probably from people who listen to nu-metal and rap, so those can be disregarded. But the album isn't a gold masterpiece by any means. Three stars was actually quite generous. Now, I've got every Nightwish album, and to me, they're really a hit-or-miss band (with a few more misses than hits); I love Oceanborn, I don't mind Century Child, two of the new songs on Over The Hills are favorable, I don't bother with Angels Fall First much anymore, and I can't stomach Wishmaster at all. So, here goes...First of all, since everyone has it stuck in their heads that Tarja is all there is to Nightwish, I will reiterate that she sounds horrid. Maybe she should spend less time kissing hubby and puffing cigarettes and more time improving her voice. Either that, or have enough sense to give up music and let Marco do all the singing. Marco actually doesn't sound half bad on this one, aside from his Korn scream toward the end of &quot;Wish I Had an Angel.&quot; Everywhere else, he reminded me a little of Hansi Kursch, although maybe not quite that good. But Tarja sounds bad. Her voice keeps cracking and she's off key almost constantly. Yes, she's classically trained. Lots of singers are, but it doesn't singlehandedly make them good, and this sounds nothing like what she did on Oceanborn and Angels Fall First, which were her best moments. On the instrumental front, Tuomas' keyboards are nothing new, Jukka's drumming isn't up to par with other albums, Marco's bass is actually quite good, and Emppu's riffs, while old and tried before, sound pretty good. The orchestra, I'm sorry to say, only covers up Tuomas' lack of innovation. I'm getting fed up with bands hiring huge orchestras to make their music for them. It's not a statement of uniqueness; the novelty wore off, and I'd much rather hear a band make its own music rather than have a 40-piece orchestra do all the work.There are exactly two fully-listenable songs on this album - &quot;Creek Mary's Blood&quot; (because I'm partial to Native American flutes) and &quot;Higher Than Hope.&quot; The latter song is purely listenable, not good. The former isn't too bad. Everything else is destroyed either by poorly-executed vocals, poorly-designed vocal structures, or poor integration of the guitars and synths together. The lyrics are pretty sappy and bland. Overall, there is no doubt that this album was made for radio and popular success. So, don't expect anything inspired. There have been rumors that this is the last we'll hear of Nightwish. In all honesty, maybe Tuomas should just quit while he's... ahead?... and avoid the next album being the Finnish equivalent of St. Anger.However, if you like Nightwish, I recommend the new albums by Leaves' Eyes (you can't get it here, you have to get it from Napalm Records or The End Records), Epica, After Forever, and Sirenia.

If all nu-metal were like this, then the subgenre wouldn't be looked down upon by those like your humble critic. It's not without flaw and is no masterpiece, but David Draiman and the band deliver a performance that embodies what all anger-driven metal should be: raw, uncut, and powerful. From the hit "Down With The Sickness" to my personal favorite "Violence Fetish" (appropriate, due to my sadistic nature... hehe), you get a load of metal power that you just don't get out of below-par bands like System of a Down (or recent Metallica, for that matter). Draiman's voice is incredible; his lyrics are a little too influenced by gangsta rap (or so it sounds), but his anger with the world is let out in a... constructive?... manner, and it all sounds good. There are a few songs that get repetitive ("Conflict"), but overall it's a good buy. "Shout 2000" is lots of fun; I don't usually like covers but this is a good one. Anyway, this coming from someone who isn't thrilled with the sledge of nu-metal that's been plaguing the airwaves in recent times: DISTURBED ROCKS!!!

I find harsh ambient noise to be one of the most rewarding genres of music to listen to, for nothing more than the sheer disturbing and emotional atmospheres it produces without having any lyrics to destroy the imagery. I would say Raison d'Etre is somewhere between the harsh, relentless nightmare of Nothing and the calm yet haunting aura of the latest Burzum release. Most of it has very little musical legitimacy, but this makes it all the more intriguing. The soundscapes are highly psychological; Peter knew exactly how to draw the listener's attention in with haunting pieces of noisescape and music that create a very murky, cold, dismal feeling within the listener. It is obviously not for casual listeners, but anyone with a true appreciation of auditory art needs to have this in his/her collection.While on the subject of harsh ambient noise, I should recommend a product which I have not found on Amazon, namely Nothing's "Nondescript." I have not heard this act's other works, but this album is phenomenal. If anyone follows the brilliant-beyond-words atmospheric metal band Agalloch, they will know the name Jason William Walton, who is the main force behind Nothing (Haughm is also part of it). A little more musical than Raison d'Etre, but the same atmosphere. I recommend that album if you liked Raison d'Etre (there are copies floating around eBay all the time). If you haven't heard Raison d'Etre yet, what are you waiting for?

Sonata Arctica was one of the first non-American metal acts I invested in, and had me hooked on power metal for a while. While I now feel that most power metal is corny and difficult to find serious, I still greatly enjoy this album. It's got everything from very fast and heavy songs to perfectly-executed and very emotional ballads. In fact, Sonata Arctica really has a knack for doing the latter, as "Last Drop Falls" and "Tallulah" are two of the best songs on the CD. "Sing In Silence" incorporates the best of both worlds and is a standout for that very reason; "The End of This Chapter" also incorporates tempo changes, but the heavier parts are not as good. "Black Sheep" is my favorite of the all-fast-&-heavy stuff, with "San Sebastian" (it's a new version of an old song) coming in as a close second. No bad songs at all.A very interesting aspect of the band is that while some bands double up on guitars, Sonata Arctica has double keyboards. Their vocalist, Tony Kakko, handles the backing keys while Mikko Harkin leads. Their guitarist doesn't stand out much, though. While these guys don't have a very big fan base according to Century Media's website, they are definitely an act to look into. I can't see why more people don't like them. For a relatively young band, these guys really know how to play.

When BTNH came out, they were still attached to Eazy-E and the only difference in the dumb NWA-style "gangsta" rap and theirs was the speed. This may be a "classic" rap album, but to make it onto a "classic rap albums" list, your CD has to be absolute trash, so I don't like this one. The newer stuff is better.

Neoclassical metal is a subgenre that is difficult for some to get into, but when I first heard about Symphony X (through looking for Opeth albums... imagine that!) and decided to give them a try, I was thoroughly impressed. Michael Romeo is a guitar master, Michael Pinella can work the keyboards like a professional, and Jason Rullo isn't to be overlooked as a drummer. Vocalist Russell Allen sometimes goes one way as the music goes the other, but on this album, he works extremely well with the band's magnificent work of musical art. There are some very well-done instrumental segues on this one, which provide a different look at what Symphony X can do. The closing track, their &quot;big&quot; one, is relatively short by Symphony X standards, coming in at only twelve minutes, but it's a very good song nevertheless, as are most of the others on this one. Symphony X has produced many good albums throughout the course of their career, but they really outdid anything they've ever done before with this one.

Cannibal Corpse is okay if you want to hear some ridiculously funny lyrics about necrophilia and extreme sadomasochism (well, you can't really understand what Barnes is saying, so you have to read it out of the liner notes), but their music is so shambled it's amazing that they, or any other traditional death metal band can get a record deal. Very fast, yes. Organized? No. It sounds like they walked into the studio, started playing random guitar chords, and had Paul beat the hell out of his drumset, and add Barnes' animalistic death growl. Like I said, the lyrics are hilarious if you've got a sick mind, but the music isn't anything to brag about. But they're better than Mortician. The only Corpse album I can stand is The Bleeding.

I'm not a huge fan of Cannibal Corpse, as I prefer melodic death metal over traditional in many cases, but this album is magnificent. It features fast, yet organized, guitar work, and while the drumming isn't the fastest in the genre, it's very good. Chris Barnes doesn't pack the humor into his lyrics with this one, as it seems more serious (?) than other releases. It features Cannibal Corpse's best material to date. Track #3 is brilliant as far as guitar work, and the lyrics do find favor with your sadistic reviewer. I love how passionately Barnes describes the art of strangulation. Only a true sadist could appreciate it. His other topics are quite humorous as well. The vocal delivery is some of Barnes' best with Cannibal Corpse. But this is an album that is highlighted by its guitar work. The band did a good job with this one, and the people that give it bad reviews simply don't understand what death metal is all about. Yes, it sounds choppy. It's supposed to! You need to listen a little more closely to hear all of the musical intricacies, and if you do, you'll know that they put a lot of effort into this album. Every sadistic mind should possess a copy of this brilliant album.

This is pretty good black metal, especially since the guitarist is good and the drummer knows something other than blast beats. Blast beats are cool, but some bands (i.e. Emperor) have a tendency to overdo them. Good music. Not much else to say.

See, if the title had anything to do with S&amp;M and the songs related thereto, it would be cool! But instead, it just means San Francisco Orchestra + Metallica...Metallica, please stay away from neoclassical metal. You're only trying to overdo yourselves more than you need to. Lately, Metallica has been releasing a sledge of junk: First there was ReLoad, which aside from the first four songs is boring in my opinion and for the most part can hardly be heralded as metal; this I will go into in due course; Garage, Inc. showcased the band's mediocre ability to do covers, which to me suffered because a) I'm typically not crazy about covers, and b) all but two of them were mediocre to horrible; and St. Anger sounds like a failed attempt to introduce Meshuggah's sound to the American mainstream under the cover of Metallica trying to &quot;return to their roots.&quot; Well, I will say that, as great of musicians as they are, Metallica never did have much character, but lately, they've been using the talent that they definitely have in all the wrong ways. A live album, trying to enter the realm of a subgenre of metal that Metallica, sadly, knows nothing about, was really a bad idea.Let's start with vocals. There are two types of metal fans in general: those who couldn't care less about vocals (and there's nothing wrong with that point of view; heck, with that type of outlook, you might just enjoy this album!), and those who feel that vocal skill is just as important as instrumental talent. Without the production and sound doctoring, Hetfield sounds bad, almost as bad as he did later on St. Anger. Okay, so you don't care about vocals. The basic fact of the matter is that Metallica is not a neoclassical band, and a symphony orchestra does not work well with their music as it would with, say, Symphony X or Blind Guardian. You really can't blame them for experimentation, but could it just be that Metallica thinks they can get away with anything they want? Apparently, according to sales figures, they can, but I think they're doing longtime fans a big disservice by changing their style so frequently. Now, since this was a live album and a one-time thing, it's easier to excuse than the foray into country/California rock on ReLoad or the sloppiness of St. Anger, but the overall whine of myself and many others is that Metallica is losing their identity and selling out. But make of it what you will; see for yourself.

Lyrics aside, COB's Hate Crew Deathroll is one (...) great album. The synthesizers really enhance the powerful guitar work and angry vocals, and the atmosphere is an inexplicable type of ambient bellicose serenity, if such an oxymoronic aura is attainable. Many of the "symphonic" black metal bands (Dimmu, Cradle, etc.) try to create a soundscape that pulls together melodic beauty and crushing metal riffs, but only Children of Bodom can execute the sound with such precision. The package delivered is like a euphoric lethal injection; it hits you hard but it feels so good... like getting some from a succubus... you know it's gonna kill you but you're loving every second of it... you get the picture. Best songs? Well, like Follow The Reaper before it, there aren't any bad songs on HCR, but "Angels Don't Kill" and "Sixpounder" are the standouts, the former because of Laiho's pseudo-clean vocals and the keyboards and the latter because of the murderous guitar riffs. The downside is, of course, the lyrics. They aren't poetic or thought-provoking like Cradle of Filth's, and tend to go for a more aggressive, less intuitive approach, much like the route Dimmu Borgir is taking. But though they're angry and vulgar, they're appropriate for the music, and not the mindless whining you hear out of easy-listening bands like Korn and Godsmack. In the end, the hardcore satanic crowd might be a tad let down, and it's definitely more for In Flames fans than Darkthrone lovers, but it's definitely a work to check out if you love melodic metal.

I bought Anthems of Rebellion on impulse; I saw it on the shelf at the music store, and figured that since Wages of Sin was pretty good, they should have done better this time. I guess if you like faster guitars, you're going to love it, but since I'm more into heaviness than speed, this didn't do it for me. It was a little better than Wages of Sin, particularly Erlandsson's precision drumming. The guitars were fast, but like the speed or not, you gotta give it to the Amott brothers for their skill. The only thing I wish they'd do is drop Angela! She sounds horrible on here; like a cross between Dani Filth and a strangled cat. Such a sound could work in many cases, but not with the music of Arch Enemy, which continues to soften up and become less intrusive. Lyrically, it's nothing new. Anyway, if you liked Wages of Sin, then you'll probably like this one. And ignore Fred Durst's bed buddy; we don't need any ebonics on the metal review pages.

Stratovarius gets what I feel to be a lot of undue credit. They are a cheesy power metal band with nothing to offer over and above what other bands of the subgenre have. Their lyrics are nothing spectacular; half of the songs are the same stupid and cliche shouting of "I hate God/there is no God." Well, something in the vicinity of 60% of the world's population is Christian, and another large chunk is Islamic, both of whom embrace a divinity, so it seems really dumb to me that a band (particularly one as corny as Stratovarius) would go out of their way to offend members of those faiths. Now, I'm solid in my religion so nothing any band could say could change mine, so I really couldn't care less what they say, but it really gets annoying when they push the same atheist views in almost every song on the album. Lyrics should be used to make the music more effective, not to present subliminal ques to weak metal fans who are easily coopted to believe whatever their favorite band tells them to believe in. But anyway, this is relatively a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, so let's talk about the talent and creativity of the band.Is Strato a talented band? Without a doubt. I will justly give credit where credit is due. But are they better than bands like Blind Guardian, Symphony X, Edguy, Iced Earth, etc. who are often overlooked by Strato fans? No way in hell. Honestly, Strato is the least creative of all of the aforementioned bands, as Strato does not incorporate any progressivism into their music. Their musical scheme is somewhat repetitive, and while I'm not denying Timo Tolkki's guitar abilities, he does tend to play the same riffs over and over again, with marginal changes to keep his playing legitimate. Kotipelto is a horrible vocalist; even Sonata Arctica's Tony Kakko, who is younger and has never had a voice lesson in his life (according to his bio on the SA website), is a far superior vocalist in my opinion. Johansson's keyboards are good, but not a whole lot different than what you'd hear from Symphony X or Dream Theater. The percussion is practically nonexistent; it sounds like they used a drum machine in the background for the "power metal" speed-percussion effect and put a guy there to bang on a drumset just to say they had a drummer.I don't want to spend my whole review bashing Stratovarius, because Elements 1 isn't all bad. The ballad [is bad], but overall, the songs are much better than stuff on Destiny or any album other than Visions. I don't own them all, but I've heard enough samples and I've been forced to endure them from others. I bought Elements 1 because I heard a sample and liked it, and from my previous exposures to Stratovarius, I was actually surprised to find a decent and halfway enjoyable album. The killer was the repetitiveness, the weak vocals and overdone lyrics, and the overall blandness of the product. Maybe I'm a little biased because of all the (in my opinion, undeserved) credit the band gets. But in all honesty, Elements Pt. 1 is a pretty good album that, if you ignore vocals and lyrics, you might find yourself liking. Heck, even I find myself popping it into the CD player every once in a while!

I haven't heard an In Flames album I don't like yet (and I've got them all), but this is one of their best, probably second only to The Jester Race. There isn't a single weak track on the entirety of it. The "three-in-one" idea was a real treat for fans, as you get Lunar Strain, the EP Subterranean, and two unreleased songs from the Jester Race era (although they did release "Dead Eternity" in a different version). Each segment of the disc features a slightly different sound, as the band started out with a style that would probably find more favor with Metallica fans than hardcore death-metalheads.The first album, Lunar Strain, was the first the world ever heard of this talented band, and features very prominent guitars (courtesy of the master Jesper Stromblad) and very high-pitched vocals (is that Anders?), in a way reminiscent of Dani Filth, albeit with better execution. They put soprano female vocals into "Everlost (Part II)", and the result wasn't bad, but doesn't seem to fit the bill for In Flames. The violin intro to "Starforsaken" is something very welcome, and the song itself is one of the highlights of the album. It also features the instrumental "Hargalaten," which sounds like it's right out of an old Norse myth. Very diverse, very good.The second part, the Subterranean EP, shows the band progressing toward the style they have become famous for. The best song on the album, "Biosphere," is contained in this portion. It seems faster than Lunar Strain, and there is one of those famous acoustic guitar segues placed in, namely "Timeless." It just wouldn't be an In Flames album without an acoustic interlude. The last piece of the album features the two unreleased Jester Race-era songs, "Dead Eternity" and "The Inborn Lifeless." The production quality doesn't seem to be at its best on these, and they are about average.In the end, you get your money's worth out of Lunar Strain/Subterranean. In Flames has changed their style, many say for the worse, in the time since. However, this is one of those albums you just have to get... trust me, you won't regret it!

For some reason, I bought a cheap second-hand copy of this album, expecting something beautiful or masterful or worthy of some sort of complimentary term after seeing all the awards this girl won and all the positive feedback on this site. Then I played it. I cycled through some of the songs to see if any of them sounded different from the one before. Nope. I immediately thought to myself, "why does this girl get all kind of praise?" Then I figured it out. She's physically attractive, she's related to someone with lots of money and fame (although I've never heard of the guy), and she plays music that won't offend anyone. A load of Grammys for that? Wow, our music industry is really desperate!Now granted, Norah has more to offer than Britney Spears or Eminem, but that's basically saying she actually has an electron worth of talent. She does not have a good voice, her piano skills are very basic, and when it comes to originality, she gets a big fat zero. Heck, two of the songs are covers of other artists' music, and they don't sound any different from anything else on the album. This is music for elevators, fancy restaurants, dentist's offices, and maybe even massage parlors, but if you try to play this in your car, you're going to create a traffic hazard because there is nothing that will put you to sleep faster. This genre of music (not sure what it is exactly) is boring and bland by nature, and there's not a whole lot you can do with it, so Norah doesn't stand out in it. She got her voice heard on MTV, and they patronized her, so everyone in America wants to own a Norah Jones CD now.I hate to go all-out to bash an artist who has good intentions, but I really have a problem with all the positive attention Norah gets while countless talented artists get left in the dust. I'm sure that fans of this classical jazz or whatever type of music it is will love this girl, and I accept and respect that. But there are ignorant people out there who say that Norah Jones is the only respectable artist in the entirety of the music industry. Well, if the slightest amount of unorthodoxy offends you, then I'd say you're probably the type to jump to conclusions and are way too conservative (which is good for politics but bad for music). Don't say that, simply because she doesn't play heavy metal or talk about anything other than romance, Norah is the only good thing in the music industry. It only drives those of us who feel differently to want to strangle your sweet, innocent little Norah. If you truly like what she's doing, then more power to you, but if you're riding the bandwagon and buying just because she's a big name, while ignoring the hundreds of talented artists that are out there but not as popular, then you're doing yourself a huge disservice, and you should be ashamed.

Edited review:I used to actually think this moron had something to offer. But he doesn't. Like almost every other rapper, he just talks over switchboard beats in stupid ebonics. It sounds like ghetto nursery rhymes. They ought to be paying people to listen to garbage like this. The only thing KSP does well is diss D.J. Paul (I do want to learn the lil' arm dance...).

I admit. I loved this CD the first time I heard it. It was in my player constantly. But then, I'd never been exposed to any of the more talented bands that don't get the airplay that this one-hit wonder got. So... all I have to do to become a big name is stuff a hot girl in front of the mic, play painfully simple guitar riffs, tap my fingers against a drumset, throw away my bass guitar, and program so much synthesizer ambience that you think there's an orchestra playing in the background? Wow, time to get started!Okay, so Evanescence isn't (or should I say, wasn't) bad. There are just better bands out there. I tend to think most female-fronted metal bands (yes, I'm talking about Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, and Within Temptation here) lose their lustre when the novelty of a female vocalist wears off... okay, so Within Temptation did nothing for me from the start, but that's an exception. Anyway, the problem with female-fronted bands, and Evanescence is the perfect example, is that too much emphasis is placed upon the vocalist. I will say that Amy Lee has the POTENTIAL to be a great vocalist... if she'd start singing and quit crying. I would recommend the darkwave duo Dargaard to anyone who likes Amy's voice. Their singer, Elisabeth Torsier, sounds alarmingly similar to Amy Lee, except she actually sings. No emoting, no sobbing, no nonsense. Another thing: the lyrics are pitifully cliche. I mean, whoever thought of singing eleven songs about mental decay and suicide? Oh yeah, I forgot "Imaginary"... Evanescence's way of saying "I like to get high." Did they honestly think anyone wouldn't get the 'subliminal' message? But seriously, mainstream bands tend to stick to topics like this that have no significance and are mortally overdone. Now on to the instrumentals. Ben Moody was hailed as the mastermind behind this band. What did he do? He played the same riff in every song! Take away the synths and Amy's voice and every song sounds exactly the same! Same tempo, same measures, same everything! I don't even thing the other guitarist played anything, except the rhythm that one time that Ben did a "solo" (which was pitiful, by the way). And WHERE WAS THE BASS??? Any bass that was in there must've been programmed because it sounded like farts. And then my favorite... Rocky Gray. How dare he call himself a drummer? Tapping your sticks against the kit does NOT constitute drumming. He played the same "beat" in every song, sort of like Ben did with the guitar. I guess if you like all your music to sound the same, then you'll love Fallen.So what is the verdict? They had potential, but like countless other mainstream bands, they failed to explore it. This is unusual, because Amy seems more like the artistic type than one who is just out to make money. The reason I give this thing 3 stars is because the synth ambience fits the songs very well, and despite her crying, Amy does have a good voice. However, if you really like female-fronted metal, I think you should invest in some music by Leaves' Eyes and After Forever. Those bands not only have incredible female singers, but have musicians who actually know how to play their instruments and make songs that sound different from the previous track. If you are into gothic metal (which this does seem to fit into, at least a lot more than Lacuna Coil), I cannot say this enough: Moonspell. So what is going to happen with the remnants of Evanescence? Well, hopefully Rocky will go back to playing in Christian "death metal" bands, Ben will learn how to play a new riff, and Amy will find a new band and push her talents a little further. This was not a bad buy, but there is better music out there.

I'll keep this short &amp; sweet. There are about 5 very good songs on here, but the rest sounds like it was thrown together. Add that to the fact that it takes up less than half of an 80-minute-capable CD, and you suddenly feel like you wasted your money. The high-profile stuff (&quot;One Step Closer,&quot; &quot;In The End,&quot; &quot;Crawling,&quot; &quot;Papercut&quot;) is the best.

Of the four reviews of this album before mine, two have been low. Well, the first is by &quot;Little Rich Kid,&quot; whose sole purpose for reviewing is to make derogatory remarks about artists he probably has never heard (and he obviously hasn't heard Battlelore because they are NOT black metal in any way) while advocating the most bland and meaningless slop on amazon.com. The other has validity to it, but I certainly don't agree with some of the points brought up in it.True, the guitar work is not outstanding, but the music as a whole is. Saying a piece of music stinks because it has relatively simplistic guitar work is like saying a piece of steak tastes bad because the package you bought it in was pink instead of yellow. There's no correlation. If you're looking for intricate guitar work, then get a Steve Vai album. Guitars are important, but there's more to music than just guitars. So this band uses them in a more melodic sense. So do Sirenia and (for the most part) Agalloch, and if you try to tell me those two bands are trash, I'm going to laugh in your face. It's like the idiots who only listen for the vocals. Let's look at the big picture instead of picking out stupid things that, in the grand scheme of things, have no significance.Now, all things considered, this is not the best album I own, but it's high on the list. It's atmospheric and the music fits the theme very well. It's almost like Burzum's music; you can't give it huge credit for being complex or innovative, but it works perfectly for the atmosphere that the artist is trying to create. The songs are short but to the point. I'd recommend this to fans of Tristania, Elis, and other high-quality neo-romantic/gothic (not that sappy back-from-Transylvania &quot;goth&quot; stuff) metal. BTW despite the last reviewer's comments, the female vocals are just fine. Not overdone like opera-metal bands, and not weak and off-key like Within Temptation.

Yeah, so they worship Satan. That's their problem, and is no reason for anyone to not buy their music, regardless of what their church says. I feel you can still be true to whatever faith you believe in, and your choice in music says nothing about that, so if you're Christian and love Dimmu Borgir (like me), then more power to you, even if the band themselves want to kill you! This is an awesome album, and although I only gave it 4 stars (it's not perfect, you know), it's a part of my collection that I'll always have a special place for, because I love blasting it out of my truck stereo at college and annoying the living hell out of the preppy little rapper kids!Shagrath's vocals are better than ever, and Vortex's clean voice adds a lot. Nicholas comes to the band bearing the gift of unbelievable drumming talent, and since I'm big on drumming, he does not disappoint in any way. The lyrics are very thought-out, and don't always point to satanism. My personal favorite track is &quot;Kings of the Carnival Creation,&quot; which sounds like a nearly eight-minute battle call. &quot;Stand rigid for the next battle/ peace means reloading your guns...&quot; I love that, as it adequately sums up my feelings on war &amp; diplomacy.In short, this album kicks a**. Go get it now, even if you're a preacher.

I had heard many good things about Cradle of Filth and this album in particular prior to purchasing it, and I just happened to find a copy in my local music store, not knowing anything about what to expect. Now that I've expanded my Filth collection, it's the worst of their albums, as the synth is way overdone, but it's still pretty good. The first two full-length songs are the best. Most of the other stuff is good, but suffers from the omnipresent vocal downfall and the overdone keyboards/synth, which overpowers the guitars at times and doesn't sound much like metal. Anyway, pretty good album, and not a bad place to start a Cradle collection.

I'm not the biggest black metal fan out there, and even though they're blatantly satanic and I'm the exact opposite, I find myself liking Dimmu Borgir. This was my second album from the infamous Norwegian black metal juggernauts, and I must say it's quite enjoyable, but not perfect. As I stated in the title, I love the cover art, even though it is meant to be sacrilegious. But the thought of a pretty girl bound and strangled... to a sadist like me, there's something beautiful about such a situation that a non-sadistic mind could never understand! But now onto the album itself.There's a lot of synthesizer on here, and sometimes that takes away from the heaviness, but also makes it more symphonic, almost cinematic at times. Shagrath's voice is very damning, and the fact that you can't understand what he's saying makes it easier for non-satanists to listen to without being offended. Of course, I wouldn't be offended anyway because those are their beliefs, but some more sensitive listeners might. So if that's what's keeping you away from Dimmu, then you might find some relief in knowing that, without the insert booklet, it won't really sound that bad to you. Drumming is good, but the guitar work is often drowned out by the synth (that also irritates me about Cradle of Filth). It's a good album, but I'd recommend Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia first, as it's heavier. Then, get yourself a copy of Stormblast. I don't have it, but my neighbor has it and I listened to his copy - good stuff!

The movie &quot;Top Gun,&quot; inspired by Topgun (a.k.a. the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School) air combat maneuvering training that made air combat survivable for fighter pilots over Vietnam and has churned out highly-skilled aviators ever since, had a lot of potential. But unfortunately, they picked actors that all the teenage girls would get all &quot;ooh-ahh&quot;-ish over and all the guys would think were cool so they could market it to an audience that is generally indifferent toward military aviation, other than saying &quot;hey that's a cool-looking jet.&quot; The thing that saved this film was the F-14 Tomcat. Since they didn't use any computer simulations, all the flight scenes were real. Great air combat scenes, although painting F-5s up with red stars on the tail isn't convincing for those of us who know a little something about aviation! Heck, they should've just asked to borrow one of those MiGs we bought from the Moldovans! Wait... that was after this movie. Anyway, it can be a good movie if you drown out the STUPID fairytale love story. Tom Cruise is a bad actor, he always has been and always will be and is in the business for the same reason Britney Spears is in the music industry... profitability. Kilmer is no better either. They bring people to the theater, and in turn, put $ in the pockets of the filmmakers, so they make a two-hour movie that has a lot of potential but ends up turning into background noise for the ol' midday nap.

Even though Emperor is gone (too bad, too bad), their charismatic front man Ihsahn is still going strong. Like his work with Emperor, Ihsahn provides great black and operatic clean vocals in addition to brilliant guitar work, but it sounds so much better without Trym pounding away at the kit, and you can actually hear the guitar intricacies! Per Erikson provides the percussion, which is simple in comparison to Emperor's work, but fits Peccatum's music much better. Ihsahn's lovely wife Ihriel provides some great soprano vocals, in addition to most of the lyrics and compositions (talent seems to attract talent) as well as the keyboards. Lord PZ (that has to be the dumbest BM pseudonym I've ever heard) is the third member of the band and contributes practically nothing. I guess it's just a family thing that he's in there. The best song is the opener, but each song is well-produced and played out beautifully. Peccatum takes the power and rawness of Emperor and combines it with the melodic and less-intrusive fluency that is exemplified by bands like Sirenia and Trail of Tears. If you liked Emperor's albums and also like a drop of gothic in your metal, then you're going to like Peccatum's Amor Fati. I've gotta get their other works now.

I love In Flames, but Whoracle (despite the great title) just seems to be lacking in comparison to albums like Jester Race, Clayman, and Colony. Part of it is the vocals, as Anders puts in his worst performance ever on the microphone. The music is good, but not really up-to-par with other material from the band. However, it's still worth having in your collection.

I think Dimmu Borgir is overrated nowadays, and their last album didn't do anything for me, but this one's a killer. It won't appeal much to the 'underground' black metal circles, and they did begin their journey toward sellouthood here, but it still rocks. &quot;A Succubus in Rapture&quot; and the bonus track (in Norwegian) are the best songs. However, like Stormblast before it, EDT is pretty much void of filler. Not for puritans at all, as you'll see in track # 6, but if you're not a soft-hearted twit, then you'll be okay. Concentrate on the music, because that's the good part. Dimmu never did get any points for being great lyricists. If you have to get one Dimmu album in your life, get this one.

I was a little hesitant in buying this album, as I wasn't thoroughly impressed with Chaosphere (although that album is pretty good), but the store had a used copy on sale for $5.99, so I picked it up. Popped it in the truck's CD player, and was hooked immediately. Not a single bad track on here. They even included an acoustic piece, &quot;Acrid Placidity,&quot; which isn't the best acoustic segue in metal, but is something new for Meshuggah and effectively displays the band's versatility. As for the best track, well they're all above-average to very good, but standouts are &quot;Future Breed Machine,&quot; &quot;Soul Burn,&quot; &quot;Inside What's Within Behind,&quot; &quot;Suffer in Truth,&quot; and &quot;Sublevels.&quot; It's not bad lyrically; I'm normally opposed to angst-driven metal, but in this case, I think they've channeled their protests effectively instead of just screaming out over the music.Meshuggah is definitely not for everyone, especially the folks that think Korn constitutes a heavy metal band. But if you've got an open mind and can see the load of talent that lies within these Swedes, you're going to enjoy this album. It's really fun to blast out of your vehicle's stereo when you drive past a bunch of kids listening to rap. You'll definitely get some laughable reactions. Anyway, it's a good CD to listen to just to listen to something, unless you're trying to sleep, of course. Anyway, get it.

I'm sorta new to death metal, so my review probably won't be the best ever. There is definitely an Ancient Egyptian overtone to this album. Each song is thoroughly researched (the insert gives a full narrative to the idea behind each one), and while at first listen it might sound like a typical DM band, after a while you notice a definite difference in these guys. Part I of "In Their Darkened Shrines" ("Hall of Saurian Entombment") has totally different instrumentals than the rest of the CD, opting for a less intrusive but more Egyptian-sounding theme. "Unas Slayer of the Gods" is over 11 minutes long, and is one of very few songs of that length that can be listened to all the way through. In short, this is a very good album that I highly recommend.

I've noticed a lot of hate for this album from other Metallica fans. If you're dedicated to the 1980s Metallica, prepare for a disappointment. If you're a little more open-minded, this might find favor with you. I have to admit, there are plenty of weak spots, but hands down, &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot; is a GREAT song. I like it slightly better than the first (the mood is more demonic and the story line finds slightly more favor in my sadistic mind). Otherwise, this is one where I'll listen to the first minute or so of some of the songs, but then find myself skipping tracks.

What an outrageous price...Anyway, if you can find this CD for less than $31.49 that CDNOW wants you to pay for it, then by all means get it. No CD is worth more than $15 in my opinion. But this is worth having. The first four tracks are great; Tarja is using the pitch she used in Century Child, so it's not operatic the whole time. I'm in the minority; I prefer 'clean' (hehe) female singing to the opera pitch. Anyway, the remake of &quot;Astral Romance&quot; isn't any better than the first, aside from the fact that they now had a bass guitar. Two of the live tracks feature Sonata Arctica's Tony Kakko as a guest vocalist; they should ask him to step in more often, because they've never had any luck with male vocalists and Kakko can actually sing. The live tracks are decent, but not wonderful. They're cool just to hear what Nightwish sounds like live without having to buy an entire live CD and risk it sounding pathetic like the In Flames Tokyo Showdown album, but I'm glad they put the live tracks onto the end of the EP because the studio songs are really good. The live tracks and the fact that there are only three new songs (well, if you consider that the title track is a Gary Moore cover, it's only two new songs) are the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Good luck finding a copy at a more reasonable price!

It's hard to decide whether Patton was more feared by the enemy or by the very men who served under him. His attitude was gruff, his outlook bloody, and his thirst for conflict insatiable. But with this film, viewers get to see exactly why this opinionated, sometimes unethical General was possibly the greatest leader on the battlefield in the European Theatre of World War II - and George C. Scott portrays Patton in a most memorable manner.Without a doubt, Patton's exploits on the battlefield won great victories for the Allies. This is, of course, not to take away from powerful leaders on both sides, such as Patton's comrade-yet-rival Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, but Patton will always be remembered by the United States Army not only for his glories, but also for the controversy he managed to stir up. This film showcases both sides of the man. His respect for the uniform and his undeniable loyalty to the United States of America made him the hero, but his quest to &quot;beat Montgomery to Messina&quot; and the incident in which he slapped an enlisted man and called him a coward do much to antagonize him in the eyes of many. That's one of the greatest things about this film: the filmmakers have made it so that it does not concentrate wholly on Patton's good side nor his bad side, but instead, create an atmosphere in which the viewer's opinion of the man constantly changes.Packed with intense battle scenes, dialogue that is often nearly as intense, and some somber moments, &quot;Patton&quot; is a film that will have your attention for the entirety of its nearly three-hour running length. If you're the special-effects lover, then this film is probably not for you, but understand that it was made before the advent of computer-aided and, in my opinion, useless and corny graphic effects. This is just pure cinematic mastery, depicting a great leader and a passionate, even if flawed, fighting man.

Since Ecliptica wasn't too easy to come by in the USA until recently, my first exposure to the fantastic Finnish bombastic power metal act Sonata Arctica was through their groundbreaking album Silence. I still concede that Silence is their finest work, but Ecliptica comes in at a close second, and ranks up with the aforementioned SA work and Nightwish's Oceanborn as one of the pinnacle works of Finnish power metal. Like its follow-up, Ecliptica features a healthy mix of upbeat heavy songs and emotional ballads, albeit with more serious lyrics than later works. Tony Kakko's vocals are higher and whinier than they were on Silence, where they were about as good as power metal vocals get without being Russell Allen or Hansi Kursch, but he still delivers a memorable performance, and his voice is not anywhere near as annoying as Timo Kotipelto's. The guitar and keyboard work is very good, especially considering that they were quite a young band at the time. The drums and bass also deserve a nod. If you've heard Sonata Arctica's more recent works, then get Ecliptica, especially if all you've heard is Winterheart's Guild, because Ecliptica simply blows that album clear out of the water!

I've heard a lot of jibberish about Darkthrone being this amazingly talented black metal band. No, they're just some goons who wear funny makeup and play mediocre riffs and shout out infantile punk lyrics. To be fair, they don't suck, but they're nowhere on the level of Burzum. Pagan metal will always be better than satanic metal, because heathens have nothing to prove as far as image goes. The only good satanic bands there were (Opeth not included) are Emperor and Ulver. Darkthrone is just trying to scare Judeo-Christians with their 'brootal' BM. It's pretty sad when a band spends more time painting their face for their album's photo shoot than they do composing the songs. Save your money and buy music from a band that's not suffering from an incurable case of (...)envy.

I don't think the band could've picked a better name for this album, as you get all-out &quot;maximum violence&quot; in both the lyrics and the music. Even without vocals, you'd be able to tell that this music isn't for preppy little Linkin Park fans; it's just a slow, ultra-heavy assault of metal that death metalheads will adore. The riffs aren't fast, and the playing is quite simple, but the effect created is much more damning in sound than, say, Cannibal Corpse (Barnes' old band). The vocals rule, and while the lyrics aren't the best in death metal, they get a (sadistic) point across. All three covers are good, particularly &quot;War Machine&quot; (I know someone who used that song in a prayer service at my old high school! That was quite funny). The original songs, however, are not to be forgotten; the two I enjoy the most are &quot;This Graveyard Earth&quot; and everyone's favorite, &quot;Bonesaw.&quot; So, now that you're feeling violent, go get this album.

This album gets 2 stars because it has a few DECENT (I dare not say good) songs on it, but for the most part, it's just pansy beats with pitiful rapping and poor attempts at singing. Do or Die has nothing to offer; they just want to show up Bone Thugs and after listening to what is supposedly their best album, it's quite obvious why they haven't.

It really took me a long time to find something I liked about this album, but after a while, it grew on me, and while I doubt it'll ever grow on me to the point where I give it any more than 2 stars, it's got good points. It unfortunately suffers from an overreliance on programming and a stray away from the band's already-minimal metal influence, but somehow or other, they manage to pull the synth and guitars in enough to make a decent product. I can't really say it's an improvement over their first album; it's got more good songs but also more filler. Basically, the tracks on here are either good or garbage. Nothing great, but also nothing mediocre. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good, and there are some tracks that are almost entirely hip-hop. Hardcore Linkin Park lovers will probably like it, but if you just use LP for an easy-listening deal, then you might want to think twice before investing in this one.

After fishing this CD out of the dumpster (long story!), I popped it into my truck's CD player, not really knowing what to expect. It was above expectations (hence the 5-star rating), and while I don't particularly care for the percussion, I find myself playing it over a few times. The songs are fairly long, taking up the majority of the space on the CD, so if you buy it, you won't feel cheated out of your cash. The vocalist is pretty good; kinda reminds me of the black voice from Dimmu Borgir but with a more noticeable accent. The girl singer is a nice touch as well. The guitars are pretty good and the lyrics are okay. Overall, it's one of my better CDs at the moment, but I don't know if it'll have lasting value just yet. But it was a good investment.

This CD was okay at first, but the flat female vocals and scrapish male vocals, combined with simplistic guitars, overdone synthesizers, and repetitive drumming make for a product that has very little lasting value. Their first CD wasn't that great, but the songs can be played over more than the ones on here. The Metallica cover is awful. Electric violins sound horrible; Pete should stick to acoustics. Anyway, if you're looking for good Norwegian goth metal, get Sirenia or old Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania, and maybe even the new Tristania, Trail of Tears, or Myriads. But stay away from Sins. On a side note, they have got to be the ugliest band on the face of the earth. Anita is cute and Ingfrid isn't bad, but the men are just gruesome in appearance.

This was an album that I simply bought on impulse, even though, being a metal fan, I wasn't expecting to be blown away by it.Well, I wasn't blown away, but I greatly enjoy it. It starts with the nearly thirteen-minute overture, which is in itself worth the buy. Normally, I get bored with overture intros after the first thirty seconds, but this one is an attention-keeper the entire way through. The songs that have singing in them come out with mixed results, but there is nothing that I'd label bad or even average; it's all fine work. They do rely heavily on guest musicians, but since there are only two of them and they both do pretty much the same thing (piano vs. keyboards, not much difference there), it's acceptable. You don't get a whole lot of guitar out of it anyway, but for an album like this, it's not such an issue. Best track is #5 (don't feel like typing the name out), as it incorporates more elements of contemporary music with the gothic/romantic/classical-era piano &amp; violin parts. The vocals are good; Anne (the good-looking one) does a very good job, but Tilo (the man that looks like a woman) has a voice that's almost as comical as his appearance, but somehow or other, it works.I just got this CD an hour or so ago, so I've only had time to skim through it, but I have a feeling it'll be seeing the inside of my CD player a lot more. I haven't really gotten into the lyrics (translations) yet, as I've only had time to flip through the pages and pick out lines here and there, but so far, I'm liking the story line. It's a lot more intricate and thought-out than many other bands can come up with. Anyway, if you need something that is true to its classical roots (I'm not sure it's gothic per se, but it's somewhere in that period) but with a nice tinge of the best parts of modern music, then Lacrimosa is the band for you. Once I get hold of some more cash, I'll be investing in their other works.

I started listening to Borknagar with their newest release Empiricism, and being thoroughly impressed with that, am now investing in the band's older work. This album features great music; a little less synthesized than the new project but seemingly lacking in some areas. ICS Vortex (now in Dimmu Borgir) is just a so-so vocalist in my opinion; he doesn't do the screams very well, and though his singing is good, Vintersorg's is better. But this still rocks. &quot;Invincible&quot; is the standout track for me. The drumming is great as well. Worth a gander if you're into black metal but aren't a goatsucker.

Emperor's IX Equilibrium is powerful metal that seems to cross boundaries from black metal to death metal in some respects. The standout is Trym's drumming, although Ihsahn and Samoth bring the guitars into play with raw brutality that any musician can appreciate. The synthesizers aren't used quite as much as they were in Emperor's older material, but are still present in many places. Ihsahn's lyrics are brilliant; you begin to forget that they're a satanic band when you read the booklet. Vocally it's not bad; the scream is hard to get used to but sounds very... emotional... but sounds like Ihsahn is tearing his throat apart. The best songs are &quot;Sworn&quot; and &quot;Nonus Aequilibrium&quot; but there aren't any weak spots. There's an untitled softer song tacked onto the end, which is pretty good. Probably not for fans of the Nightside-era Emperor, but worth a listen.

I won't deny Christofer Johnsson's musical abilities and genuine skills as a composer and guitarist. The music to this piece is absolutely fabulous. The problem is the vocals. I like the idea of using choirs, although I'd have liked a more Benedictine-style male choir (a la Tristania's Beyond The Veil) in preference to the one used on here. The problem is that they don't vary their singing enough. Some more solo vocals would've helped the variety. Take the song &quot;Birth of Venus Illegitima&quot; for example. It's one of my favorites on the album, but the choirs keep singing the same pattern over and over. But aside from that, the voices themselves are very good, the guitars are fantastic (if you consider Therion a &quot;gothic&quot; band, then you'll be happy to know that the band doesn't follow the gothic trend and has no problem performing guitar solos), and the composition as a whole is top-notch. I'm still debating putting forth more funds for new Therion CDs, as I need money for my own musical ventures, but I definitely recommend this album for fans of good orchestral/symphonic metal.

Century Media has the reputation of signing some of the best artists in metal, but also some of the worst. Fortunately, Shadows Fall is in the former category, and this album proves that metal has not left the United States just yet. With noticeable influences from In Flames and other 'Gothenborg sound' metal acts, it's a given that these guys will be good. The cover of &quot;Welcome To The Machine&quot; is the standout track, although the title track and &quot;The Idiot Box&quot; are good as well. Truthfully, most of the material on this album is great, and I'll be investing in more of Shadows Fall's products soon.

Burzum is a killer act, no doubt about it. The production on this is horrible, but unlike other black metal bands, it doesn't bother me with Burzum because, in a very hard-to-explain way, it helps create the tortured, damning atmosphere. The one thing I don't like is the synthesized vocals instead of the screams on Burzum's s/t. Even though it's very repetitive, the 25-minute keyboard track is great. The first song, as other reviewers have mentioned, is fantastic. Burzum rocks; Oystein Aarseth can eat his decomposing heart out.

I don't like underground black metal. It sounds like it was recorded in some hillbilly's garage during a cattle stampede. But Satyricon's Nemesis Divina is a high-quality product. The production isn't perfect, but it's not horrid like Darkthrone or all those other guys who think they look evil and scare Christians. Satyricon isn't scary either, they're just ugly. But they make good music. Satyr has a pretty powerful scream, and his and Kveldulv's (yes I know he's also in Darkthrone under another stage name) guitars are, unlike a lot of BM bands, actually played with skill. Frost's drumming speaks for itself. Half the lyrics are in Norwegian so you can't understand them. The rest I didn't bother reading. Purists won't like the synth use but it's all for the better. Get this if you want a (*gasp*) well-produced and composed black metal album that isn't loaded with dumb satanic stuff. While Satyr would probably deny the accusation, this is a band that's about the MUSIC (which bands SHOULD be), not some stupid 'evil' image. Good schtuff.

The first I had heard of Tiamat was their newer material (i.e., Judas Christ), which I was not impressed with. But I found a video for &quot;Whatever That Hurts&quot; (very good song) on launch.com and it sold me to buy this CD. It's overall pretty good, but the aforementioned track is still my favorite. I don't like Johan's vocals, but other than that, I can't say there's really any problem. The instruments are played with skillful simplicity, if you will; there's not a whole lot of speed or technicality involved, but the band members know what they're doing. You get a lot of music for your money, too, which is something bands should really consider doing more often. Anyway, this is a great CD for people who are new to the band, but if you're a longtime Tiamat fan, chances are you already have it.

It may only be eight tracks in length, but each one is a memorable listening experience. &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; is one of those sixteen-minute songs that stays enjoyable the entire way through, but the other seven songs are a lot of fun as well. Barlow's vocals sound absolutely possessed, and the piano intros really enhance the dark damnation atmosphere. Add that to the exceptional guitar work, and you have a masterful album sent straight from Hell. If you like dark music with magnificent musicianship, and you don't own a copy of &quot;Burnt Offerings,&quot; I'd suggest you hit the &quot;add to cart&quot; button right now.

I never took much interest in Theatre of Tragedy, as I feel Tristania makes them look like a high-school band trying to keep their heads out of the water, but after finally getting up the courage to risk Aegis (and liking it, aside from the not-so-impressive vocals) and reading all the "too good to be true" reviews on here, I decided that I had enough cash to spare to risk this one. At first I didn't like it, because it was too slow, but after putting it through its cycles a few times, I'm warming up to it. Best songs are "Bring Forth Ye Shadow" and "Black as the Devil Painteth." What I don't get is, Raymond does awesome death vocals, but his 'clean' singing is pitiful, and he just talks half the time. Normally, one has a much easier time singing than doing extreme vocals. He must have the reverb maxed out on his microphone. Liv Kristine sounds awesome, much better than her toned-down voice on Aegis and immeasurably better than what they confined her to on the poopy-pop albums that they made after that. The guitarists don't play anything amazingly complex, but it's nice and heavy, just the way I like it. The keyboards are perfect; very dark and depressing. The drums aren't wonderful but they suffice.There are some minor issues I have with this, but nothing really bad. I thought the intro could've had some more character, being just a piano piece. Also, I don't like parts where Liv and Raymond sing together. I will continue to reiterate that Raymond I. Rohonyi cannot sing for the life of him, so when not using the voice distortion, the man ought to just keep his mouth shut and let the talented (and pretty) one do all the work. But those are minor issues. Forget the new crap that the band is making; I understand bands change, but the new music is a blatant attempt to sell out and proves that the band ran out of ideas, plus Raymond lists twits like Eminem and Dr. Dre as his favorite artists and says he hates guitar-driven music, and you know that can't be good for a metal band. So get this, Aegis, and their self-titled album, but do not go anywhere near Musique or Assembly.

Iced Earth's humble beginnings are showcased in this album, which features songs remade with their current members, most notably vocalist Matt Barlow. While none of the tracks will ever go down as one of their classics, except maybe &quot;Angels Holocaust,&quot; it's a great album to have just to see how much this band has progressed in their ~15 years of existence. Jon Schaffer is brilliant, and I don't think his badass band of Hog riders is going anywhere anytime soon.

I have mixed feelings about The Gathering. I don't like Anneke's vocals that much because of the way she wails, but it's not that big of a deal. Their music gets a bit repetitive at times, and there's nothing about this album that can keep my attention for the entirety of it. The title track is excellent, and there are a few more that really stand out, but there are also those that aren't so good. I won't adorn this piece with praise and glory, but I do recommend checking it out. If you're one who likes vocals that dominate the music, then you'll love it. I will say that Anneke sings in a very down-to-earth and appropriate manner, but seems to push it sometimes. The music is very atmospheric; not necessarily gloomy (although it is in some places) but very sensual. It just can't hold my attention very long. But it may for others, so don't shy away.

I never took any interest in the Spawn comic, but I like the way Iced Earth presents it. Lyrically, it's pretty good, but as with all Iced Earth and other metal albums, I'm more interested in the musicianship and vocal delivery, and as always, Iced Earth does not disappoint. Once again, Jon Schaffer proves to the world that he is truly a musical genius, and the guitars on here (Schaffer's and Randall Shawver's) are brilliant. Matt Barlow puts in one of his best vocal performances to date, even though he doesn't sound possessed like he did on Burnt Offerings. The addition of female vocals on &quot;A Question of Heaven&quot; (the standout track) was a nice touch as well. Every song is good, and there are a few that will go down as the band's classics. The only minor rant I have is the artwork. The CD is cast in a vomit-inducing purple, and the colors in the pictures look like they came out of a kiddie cartoon. Eh, who looks at stuff like that anyway? This is great music that I'd recommend to any true METAL fan.

If only the production had been just a little cleaner, this would be a five-star album. One thing I really like that most others don't is the clean vocals of Fiery G. Maelstrom (b.k.a. Garm). Most people seem to think he can't sing, but I sure as hell like his voice over Simen's. Not quite on Vintersorg's level though. Otherwise, this rather short release packs a furious heathen punch with thunderous percussion and searing guitar work. Highly recommended to fans of atmospheric black metal.

I concur with the reviewer who said that this sounds like a compilation of rejected "Silence" tracks. There are a few good songs on it, but it isn't anywhere near as charismatic or powerful as the previous, and what's even worse, it sounds rushed. To keep it short, it isn't garbage, but I know Sonata Arctica could've done FAR better.

If I would have started my Lacuna Coil collection with this fairly mediocre debut, chances are I wouldn't have explored their far better later material. First blunder was debuting with an EP. Basically, it sounds rushed, like they just wanted to be heard instead of taking the time to produce a masterful work as we all know they are 110% capable of. Also, it's doom metal, a subgenre which doesn't even deserve to be called 'metal.' This is depressing music for suicide freaks, not for those of us who are looking for meaning in music. But the biggest downfall comes in the vocal regime. Cristina Scabbia hadn't perfected her voice yet, and sounded like she was straining her vocal cords in many of the songs. I've always thought Andrea Ferro sounded like James Hetfield on a small dose of helium, but he doesn't sound so good on here either. Basically, a combination of soft and boring music coupled with mediocre vocals made this a fairly below-par start for a band that has since proved to be one of the most unique and capable in the music industry. But then again, some of the greatest bands ever (Opeth, Nightwish, Metallica, Symphony X) came out with not-so-stunning debuts. And no matter how soft or bland it is, it is worlds better than anything by that overrated atrocity of a band known as The Gathering. Anyway, I wouldn't suggest starting your Coil collection here, but once you've gotten Comalies (their near-flawless new one) and Unleashed Memories, and maybe even In a Reverie, then you can get this one.

While this is a pretty blasphemous album and I'm not really into that sorta thing, the music is great. Fernando has a great voice, unlike a lot of male vocalists in 'gothic' metal. The song &quot;Magdalene&quot; is extremely hypnotic and I usually end up playing it over six to eight times, much to the dismay of my roommate, but hey, it's my payback for him making me listen to punk and soft rock! If they hadn't done the whole sacrilege deal, track #11 could've been the perfect theme song for Michael Jackson! Anyway, a good album with a few minor flaws, but nothing to keep one from purchasing it.

While power metal is, let's all admit it, corny by nature, there are some special bands that can make an overall laughable genre of music into something beautiful. No band can claim this ability more than Nightwish. Even when you put aside the glorious vocals of Tarja, you get something instrumentally spectacular. Tuomas knows how to execute keyboards properly, without overdoing the synthesizer or drowning out the guitars & drums. The orchestration demonstrates musical precision found in very few bands. More so than any other Nightwish until Century Child, Oceanborn fully exploits the true potential of these crazy Finns to a level that will blow away even the person most adamantly opposed to power metal.Basically, it's not pure power metal, but it's obvious that the subgenre has had an enormous influence on the band. If you could imagine Stratovarius mixed with Dream Theater and an operatic female voice, you'd get a slight idea of what to expect. Actually, that was a pretty bad analogy, because Nightwish is really in a class of their own. You have to hear them for yourself. Most will argue that it's Tarja's vocals that make the album what it is. I'm one to disagree. While she has a lovely voice, it doesn't always work with the music. There are times when Tarja goes one way and Tuomas & the band go the exact opposite, particularly in the ballads. She should consider lowering the pitch an octave for some of the tunes (and I think she realized that when they made Century Child). But when she manages to interwtine her vocals with the music, such as on the brilliant and powerful track "Gethsemane", the result is beyond words. I'm a sucker for good drumming as well, and Jukka does not disappoint. In a vein similar to Lacuna Coil, Nightwish utilizes percussion to add character and complexity to their music, and not just to back up the guitars or, like many mainstream American bands (hint hint: Evanescence), just to say they have a drummer.Standout tracks include the aforementioned "Gethsemane", the synth-loaded (but not overdone) "Sacrament of Wilderness", the bonus track ballad "Sleeping Sun" (not listed on the back of the jewel case), and, once you get into it and if you can drown out the pitiful male vocals, "Devil & The Deep Dark Ocean." Those seeking brilliant guitar work may be a tad let down, but Emppu can deliver a satisfactory performance for those who aren't anal about precision riffs. He's not a bad guitarist by any means, it's just that he's no Peter Lindgren or Kirk Hammett. This was Nightwish's first album with a bassist, so that makes it sound a lot better than their debut Angels Fall First, which was good but lacking in production and sound quality. Finally, on a side note, Tarja was quite a good-looking girl in her younger days, although it seems as if she's put on some weight (I shouldn't talk...) and doesn't look so good in the Century Child pics... sorry if I sound shallow. Anyway, get this album, because if you're disappointed with it, then I think there might be something wrong with your taste in music. I mean, you'd have to be one of those morons that thinks Eminem has talent to say this is a bad album!

I don't care that Varg killed that sewer rat Euronymous... I think he did the world a favor.Anyway, he's a great musician, despite what some may say. Sure, his music isn't technical, but he's an expressionist, not a scientist. His screams are very passionate, and although many may be turned off by them, I actually think they sound pretty good (keep in mind, this is coming from the guy who lists Dani Filth as one of his favorite vocalists). Burzum's lyrics are thought-provoking and full of emotion, and are delivered in a way that makes you feel the Count's torment. His instrumentals aren't brilliant, but are great to create atmosphere in the listener. If there is one issue I have with this disc, it's the volume, which is too low, but if that's the only problem, then I'd say that Count Grishnack did a great job. One other thing; I don't care if he's a racist. I'm not one myself, but if black rappers can use terms like &quot;cracker&quot; and &quot;devil&quot; in their music and be praised for it by Al Sharpton and his buddies, then Varg Vikernes should be allowed to have bigot thoughts and not be scolded for it. Hypocrites. Anyway, Burzum rocks, and I think everyone should get this album now.

Okay, so it's not really the definitive review, I just thought that sounded good. Anyway, onto the album. Great material, particularly the overdose of brutality that Lord Infamous brings. I wish he'd rap like this (or like he did in the beginning) these days. He steals the show on this album, particularly in "Smoked Out." I might be the first to say that I actually like "When God Calls Time Out" since a lot of people seem to hate that one. I like the lyrics, but the style doesn't quite fit the beat. "Slob On My Nob" is hilarious. The only one I don't like is "Hell Naw." Good stuff; buy this. It's kinda like sleeping at a Holiday Inn Express - it won't make you smarter, but you'll feel better. Pardon the dumb philosophies. Seriously though, great album as far as lyricism and production go.

It's not often that you find a band that's willing to experiment with several different music styles on the same album. Virgin Black's Sombre Romantic features songs in black metal style (&quot;Drink the Midnight Hymn&quot;), darkwave (&quot;Lamenting Kiss&quot;), gothic (&quot;Museum of Iscariot&quot;), opera/symphonic (opening two songs), and some other goodies thrown in. Rowan's operatic vocals are fantastic; it's nice to find a band with a trained male vocalist instead of the screamy 80's metal voice or overused black/death screaming &amp; growling, the latter of which is becoming used in all the wrong places by some bands. There is very little black metal screaming on this album, and when it does appear, it is used effectively. The songs, composed by Rowan and guitarist Samantha Escarbe, are constantly changing and never get boring. The lyrics show some religious themes, but do not try to force anything down people's throats. It is a lyrically superb product overall. The compositions are very solid, and although no two songs sound alike, there is little disparity in quality of musicianship. Highly recommended to fans of anything from Tristania to Burzum.

Orchid is my least favorite Opeth album, but I'd feel like a blasphemer to give anything by this out-of-this-world band any less than four stars. The production is a little lacking, and Akerfeldr's growls come out more like black-metal screams, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it aside from that. Opeth is a band that seems to get better every time, with the exception of their second album Morningrise, which I doubt they'll ever top, so it's kinda to be expected that their debut wouldn't be all that stunning. However, I will emphasize that it is FAR better than anything you'll find on the mainstream music scene. If you're a Linkin Park fan, you'll not understand nor appreciate why this is great music.Why is it a good album? The songs are lengthy, but they do not get boring. Peter Lindgren is an amazing guitarist, whether he's playing an electric or acoustic guitar. The guitars don't sound as heavy as you might expect from a death metal band, but the term &quot;death&quot; metal seems so wrong for a band as brilliant as Opeth. Melodic death, however, is a subgenre that is totally different than traditional death, and the keyword is &quot;melodic,&quot; a term that this album defined. Would it be wise to start your Opeth collection here? Well, that depends. If you do start with Orchid, you'll only appreciate later releases more. But if you want to start with their all-time best, then go for Morningrise, Still Life, or Deliverance. But Orchid is without doubt worthy of having in your music collection. Like everything by these four amazing Swedes, it's got a special place in mine.

Five songs, each over ten minutes in length. You'd never think any band would be able to perform such a feat and make it all sound good. But this is no ordinary band we're talking about here. Now, the demo track &quot;Eternal Soul Torture&quot; that you get with remastered versions isn't very good, and this is only because of its horrible production quality, but every other track is damn near flawless. Even the 20-minute &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot; is enjoyable all the way through. This was the last Opeth album I bought, and has taken Still Life's place as my favorite of their albums. Now that it's widely available again, if you missed your opportunity the first time, don't miss out on what could possibly be heralded as one of THE greatest albums of all time.

What do you get when you cross a guy who thinks pop and metal mix, an overly distorted guitar, a bassist who only plays the open G string, and a Finnish Britney Spears wanna-be with the same amount (or should I say, lack of) vocal talent? Lullacry. The sole reason I even ventured anywhere near this disc is because they're on tour this summer in the USA with Nightwish and I wanted to see what I'd have to put up with before a real band took the stage. Well, they say no pain, no gain, and I guess they're not so horrid that I'd cancel my plans to see one of the greatest bands around just because these [guys] are opening for them, but it won't be enjoyable. Tanja's voice is about as good as Anita Auglend's (The Sins of Thy Beloved), and that's basically saying she sounds like a synthesizer. Not a compliment. The guitars sound like death metal guitars, and when the guitars cut out for a synth piece, the disparity in sound is pathetic. They sound like a garage punk band trying to be big and bad, while appealing to a crowd of horny men by stuffing an "attractive" (sorry, Tanja doesn't do it for me) chick in front of a mic and playing over-amplified guitar chords randomly over a cliche synthesizer piece. Sorry folks, if you like metal (which is what this band is improperly categorized as), you might want to think twice. It's more for fans of anger-punk, nu-metal, and whatever that dung that Theatre of Tragedy has been producing as of late is.

Top three recent albums that feature formerly good artists putting themselves in the wastebasket for good:3. Three 6 Mafia - Da Unbreakables2. Metallica - St. Anger1. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony - Thug World OrderBone really sold out with this one. All of the songs are "catchy" and they try to do gangster R&B; too much. Face it guys, you were better than Do or Die, so you don't have to do what they do to prove it. Only Krayzie can sing; the others shouldn't even attempt it. Bizzy Bone sounds horrible, and you just gotta love Layzie's casual shouting of "f*** the war on terrorism" in "What About Us." Sure, nobody cares about the 9/11 victims' families and friends. He shouldn't even be in the music industry, so why does he have the audacity to say something like that? He's a pitiful rapper and his singing could be used to torture prisoners. The only one who made any improvement on here was Wish Bone, and even he just sounds like a rambling gangster. The collab with 3LW was totally unnecessary. Too much R&B;, not enough original material. Their "cover" of Phil Collins' "Take Me Home" (which they creatively dubbed "Home") was a slaughter of a song that wasn't that good to begin with (I loved Phil Collins when he was with Genesis, but his solo stuff is too lovey-dovey and soft). This was the last straw; Bone is done.

After listening through this a couple times, and after hearing another album of the sort ("Sonic Jihad" by Snake River Conspiracy... do NOT buy that album if you value good music, even if someone threatens your life if you don't), my overall assessment of it changed. No, I didn't edit my review because of all the negative votes. I'll tell you exactly what I think, and I don't give a rat's behind what you think.First of all, I still would've liked more instrumental and less programming. I'm interested in more than just vocals and electronic bass. I still concede that the vocals are not that good, as Free sounds like she's tearing her throat inside out just trying to hit certain notes, but considering that the album is directed at underachieving crack fiends that are all about anger and rebellion, it seems fitting. But she doesn't have a good voice, and it's clear she's never been trained to sing properly. As for Bruce, well, maybe he should play a little more guitar and do a little less programming, as the best parts of their songs are the heavy parts. The title track is the best song, and there are maybe three or four others that'll hold the listener's attention, but there seems to be a lot of filler.I'm still curious as to why they chose "kidneythieves" as their band name...

Do or Die are commercial "pimps" (morons) that can't rap so they try to sing. They can't do that either. Neither can Johnny P. Their music is boring and their songs sound like something you'd find on a Britney Spears CD with a little bit of cursing and Ebonics thrown in. Save your money and instead buy yourself a hammer to smash all the Do or Die CDs at your local music store.

If you're going to make a live album, then make it good. Iced Earth's &quot;Alive in Athens&quot; is marvelous. Even Cradle of Filth's &quot;Live Bait for the Dead&quot; is at least a quality product. But In Flames, a band just as capable as the two aforementioned groups, decides they just want to add another album to their discography, and produces a very sloppy recording. I'm not going to say anything about the songs themselves, aside from &quot;Moonshield&quot; and &quot;Gyroscope&quot; which have their acoustic parts removed, because we all know that In Flames is a band composed of extremely talented musicians. I will comment on the fact that Anders' clean singing is poor, though. Instead, I want to focus on the quality of the disc.In Flames' studio albums feature high-quality production, so I'd think fans would expect a live album to at least sound like there was more than a tape recorder and a computer to record the sound. Basically, this album sounds like what you'd hear if you decided to take your camcorder and record the band's performance on it, and were watching it played back. Not good. This is something you buy to complete a collection, but don't be hasty.

Sculptured, the brainchild of Agalloch guitarist Don Anderson, brings forth their second major offering, taking somewhat of a different direction than the previous masterpiece "The Spear of the Lily is Aureoled." This time it not only features a trumpet and a trombone and no synths, but has John Haughm on drums and the masterful Jason William Walton on the pulse. There are also clean vocals, which take up about half of the music, whereas Anderson's growls take the other half. This isn't like anything that the former Aeolachrymae bands (Agalloch, Nothing, Susurrus Inanis) have done but is worth having in any collection that features those bands. The metal-fused-with-jazz really worked out; from Haughm's comments in some interviews I was expecting death metal, but it really isn't. I highly recommend this to fans of anything from Opeth to Novembers Doom.

Three 6 Mafia does it again. Now, none of the songs were actually on the movie (except "2-Way Freak"), but this is a non-stop crunk party on one CD. It's more of a Hypnotize Minds compilation than a Three 6 album. There are some skits from the movie scattered throughout, and since they're so short, they're not as intrusive as some skits on rap CDs. See below for a song-by-song rating:1. 2-Way Freak (DJ Paul, Juicy J, La Chat) -- 5/52. The Restaurant Scene (skit) -- n/a3. Mafia (Hypnotize Camp Posse) -- 5/54. Baby Mama (DJ Paul, Juicy J, La Chat) -- 5/55. Gangsta Ni99az (DJ Paul, Juicy J, Gangsta Boo) -- 5/56. Wona Get Some, I Got Some (T-Rock, Tear Da Club Up Thugs) -- 4/57. 1st Crime Scene (skit) -- n/a8. O.V. (Lord Infamous) -- 5+/59. U Got Da Game Wrong (DJ Paul, Juicy J, La Chat) -- 4/510.

Big Pat's Warehouse (skit) -- n/a14. They Don't F*** Wit U (Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat) -- 5/515. Slang & Serve (T-Rock) -- 5/516. War Wit Us (DJ Paul, Juicy J, Crunchy Black, La Chat) -- 5/517.

I was originally deterred from buying this gem because of all the "Nightwish fell off" comments being posted on this website, but thanks to the harsh criticism dealt out by many "fans" on here, it astonished me and I'd easily label it Nightwish's best effort to date. So Tarja isn't using the opera pitch the entire time. THAT'S A GOOD THING!!! She's got a quite lovely voice, but all too often it went against the direction of the music, or was just way too overdone. This time around, it's not so intrusive, and while there are a few parts that signal that her opera days have scraped all the power out of her throat, the vocals fit the music much better, and she can still hit the high notes flawlessly most of the time. However, Sinergy's Marco Hietala (Sinergy and Nightwish just don't seem to mix; Nightwish has too much character) was a BAD idea on vocals. He's worse than Timo Kotipelto. Fortunately, he doesn't get much mic time. For some reason, Nightwish has never had much luck with male vocals.What is it about this album that makes it better than previous releases? Well, if you've read through my reviews, I've made it clear that I do not care for Wishmaster at all. It's too commercial-sounding and there's not enough variation between the songs. I think this one took many fans by surprise, as there's much more synthesizer use and the guitar doesn't stand out as much. But Emppu was really never a major force behind the band, and I think Jukka's drumming stands out more than anything instrumentally. Being a sucker for good drummers, this pleased me very much. Also, Century Child sounds less like power metal, taking Nightwish's sound from being similar to Sonata Arctica with female vocals to being closer to something you might expect from a recent Lacuna Coil album, albeit a little more upbeat.Starting with the opener, "Bless The Child," this disc is going to hold your attention. From the beautiful but powerful opener, it goes into the high-energy "End of All Hope." "Dead To The World" is rather dull, as, like I've mentioned, Marco's voice is pitiful, but the next track, "Ever Dream," is a glorious combination of mellow piano/acoustic guitar parts with an upbeat chorus and synth/electric guitar segment. "Slaying The Dreamer" is good until Marco attempts extreme vocals, as he sounds less like a death/black metal vocalist and more like someone off of Sesame Street, but the guitar work is some of the best Emppu ever did. "Forever Yours" is a relaxing ballad, one of their better ones, and "Ocean Soul" could've been excellent had they not put in that annoying ringing/chiming sound, but it's pretty good. Then you get "Feel For You," which has a nice sound but gets extremely repetitive. "Phantom of the Opera" seemed like a great experiment for the band, but once you hear Marco, you start to question their ethics in making such a slaughter, although Tarja shines like the angel she... well... sorta is. It all ends with "Beauty of the Beast," the ten-minute, three-part closer, which starts out very nicely but gets annoying after the change in music.Overall, a good work by Nightwish that really doesn't deserve all the negative criticism it gets. In fact, the only thing I can find wrong with it is that they repeat the choruses too much at the end of many of the songs. Be open-minded; the Wishmaster/Oceanborn days are over, and Nightwish has matured. Either accept them for what they choose to do with their music, or find another band. I don't see how anyone could not at least enjoy Century Child.

Let me start by saying that I have not read this title, nor do I wish to. I am not a fan of Sen. Kerry's political views, but to put out a title like this is deplorable. First of all, this all happened 30 years ago. I'm not saying that, if the assertions are true, that it was right. What I am saying is that I have a hard time believing that all of this happened that long ago and we're just now hearing about it. We could make the argument that President Bush is unfit for command because there are some questionable marks on his military record. But as far as I'm concerned, those accusations are neither confirmed nor unconfirmed, so I feel that he did an honorable service to the Air National Guard (by the way, all of you who say Bush is any less a soldier than Kerry JUST because he was ANG and not active duty, you've just spat upon every single one of the hard-working men and women of our reserve forces, who in reality do some very vital work for our defense). Same goes for John Kerry. As far as I'm concerned, he served his country honorably in Vietnam. I could very easily be suckered into believing a load of nonsense brought upon by some special interest group, but since I despise the existence of all special interest groups, be they lib or con, Rep or Dem, I will deny these accusations just for that purpose. Do the Swift Boat Veterans for "Truth" (a word that has no significance in all of politics; if you think any partisan newspaper, magazine, spokesperson, whatever is telling you the truth, then you're living in a handmade utopia and it's time to wake up) have any connection to President Bush? I don't know, and without concrete evidence to tie them to him, I will make no accusation that they are. Is there some political motivation behind all of this? Or is it just resentment? We will never know, because American media figures are not objective enough to see through the veil of ignorance cast upon the issue by various special interest groups. Why don't we just ask Michael Moore? The American people seem to think he's some kind of god, which I can't understand because I've seen no credentials for his political knowledge. Why don't we ask CNN or MSNBC, or on the other hand, Fox News? We'll just get a bunch of liberal (CNN, MSNBC) or conservative (Fox) B.S.The reality of this issue is, this is just an attempt to slander John Kerry and sway support toward a special interest. I think it's rotten; there is no objectivity in any of these reports/accusations. It's all I've been hearing about on the news lately. We've got millions of people affected by a hurricane, and all I'm hearing is "did John Kerry deserve those Purple Hearts?" Well, my late father was a Vietnam vet who received two Purple Hearts, so I'm inclined to say that any person who served their country and was wounded in the process more than deserves those medals. So let's please cut the libel.Another point I'd like to make is the fact that NONE of the reviews I've read thus far have been helpful. All I'm seeing is a bunch of propaganda. You all talk about the BOOK being propaganda? Have you READ your reviews? They're either anti-Bush or anti-Kerry. How about an anti-Unfit For Command review for once?Can't wait to see how many negative votes this one gets...

I have a confession to make... this is the first (and so far, only) CD I own with Jan Axel von Blomberg, a.k.a. Hellhammer, on drums. I don't care how much I hate Mayhem or any of those other 'old skool' black metal bands, I might have to buy their CDs just for his performance!Winds' album &quot;Reflections of the I&quot; is not a metalhead's album. Just because it has a big-name black metal drummer does not mean that the underground satan crowd is going to love it. Fortunately, from what I've seen, most fans don't go into it with that assumption, so we don't see many detractors. The point is, Winds is an awesome band who really knows what they're doing. The integration of violins, cello, and viola into the traditional guitar/bass/drum composition is simply flawless; unlike a lot of bands that use such symphonic composition (think Metallica's S&amp;M), this doesn't sound like two albums recorded over one another. The songs are majestic and beautiful, while remaining powerful and thought-provoking. It's not all mellow by any means; there's plenty of heaviness, but it stays melodic throughout. I must admit that I am not the biggest fan of Lars Eric Si's vocals, but as one reviewer so kindly pointed out, he's way better than James LaBrie! He sounds a little like the vocalist in Lacrimas Profundere. I saw on The End Records' website that Winds is going to release another album shortly. Guess who will be buying it? I suggest that you, faithful review-reader, pick up a copy of Winds' first masterpiece today, because I highly doubt you'll be left disappointed.

This is my favorite Dimmu album, which really isn't saying much in perspective, but I do like it. As for my black metal fix, I'm preferential to Agathodaimon, Burzum, Dark Funeral, Emperor, Immortal, Satyricon, and the like rather than Dimmu and COF. But this album seems to fit into the category I like. It's supposedly pretty vicious lyrically, but I don't understand Norwegian so they could be talking about golden showers for all I know. I don't care either. I'm interested in their fine musical compositions, which mix perfectly-executed keyboards with roaring guitars and strong percussion, as well as Shagrath's trademark vocal style. It is a very cold album; maybe not cold in that evil way that Emperor is, but in a more bleak, empty way like Agalloch. Definitely a must-have for people interested in good metal. So what if the production is horrid.

I'm not much of a TOT fan, especially because their vocalists get on my nerves, but this is a really good, mellow album. At first listen, it was only Liv Kristine Espenaes that annoyed me, but after trying desperately to drown out the pitiful vocals, I realize now that Raymond Rohonyi can't sing either. Half the time, he doesn't even try, he just talks over the music. Now I'll be fair: they're not horrible vocalists, and Liv even sounds good in some songs, but there are those times when I just want to wrap my hands around her silky little neck and squeeze her voice down an octave or two, such as in "Venus." But she really makes "Cassandra" good. Raymond takes most of "Aoede," an eerie-sounding song with lots of electronics and my personal favorite, to himself, and it sounds pretty good since he decided to sing it. He does get a little off key sometimes. But I can usually overlook the vocals to the point where I can at least enjoy the song, except in "Bacchante," which wasn't that good to begin with.Instrumentally, it's a solid release, even though it's not heavy at all and you can really only hear one of the two guitarists at any given time. Sometimes you'll get an overdose of synthesizer, maybe as a prelude to the complete turn of events they'd do after this (I haven't heard Musique in its entirety, but from the samples on this site, I have mixed reactions to it). The Olde-English lyrics are a nice touch as well, even if you have to be a Literature/Liberal Arts major to understand what they're saying. Hey, it makes it more interesting! Now, since Theatre of Tragedy has all but abandoned making this type of music and has essentially sold out, I'm not even going to attempt to say what they could do to make it better, especially since I understand that now they've lost Liv and the band is in shambles, so I'm thinking they're probably done. But whatever the case, this is a pretty good album if you don't mind the iffy vocals.

Snake River Conspiracy is just one of the many &quot;bands&quot; (I use the term lightly) that are plaguing America by putting a ticked-off female who clearly can't sing and a guy who sits behind a programming board all day together and churning out some misguided noise. I could swear this was the same band as kidneythieves, except SRC has no variety whatsoever. So Tobey Torres hates the world. Do I care? Don't be misled by the samples on this site; they sounded okay to me at first, so I bought a cheap copy of it ($4.99 and I still feel cheated). It doesn't sound so good in a CD player. It's ungodly repetitive, and the synth effects are so corny that you'd think you were riding a kiddie carnival ride listening to them.If you think that there's something wonderful about some girl that couldn't sing if you held a knife to her throat shouting about all her anger with the world over music that hardly has any instrumentalism attached, then this is the album for you. If you think excessive cursing and saying &quot;I hate you, I want you to die&quot; constitutes poetry, then you'll love Sonic Jihad. But if you're looking for meaning in music, stay as far away from this &quot;shock rock&quot; techno dung as is humanly possible. Tobey curses more than David Draiman, and that's pretty pathetic. I fell off my chair laughing at her pitiful attempts at extreme vocals. She's as bad as the girl from Kittie; if you can't control your throat, then DON'T TRY TO SCREAM! Hell, the girl can't even sing, let alone venture into the demanding regime of extreme vocals. The end result is flat and emotionless; she sounds like a little girl that just swallowed a burning marshmellow on the family camping trip. It seems so appropriate that there is a song called &quot;Strangled&quot; on here, because you'll surely want to strangle Tobey after listening to her attempts at vocalizing.Despite my over-critical nature, I'm not looking to go all-out and bash an artist, but when there is clearly a lack of talent involved, then I feel that promoting such an artist is a slap in the face to artists who are passionate about their music and execute it with talent and skill. &quot;Oh Well&quot; is the only song on this CD with an appreciable guitar segue. Otherwise, it's just white-girl (or latino or whatever she is) hip-hop/R&amp;B. Just read their liner notes; you'll see words like &quot;homies&quot; and &quot;muthaf*ckin'&quot; - can you say wannabe ghetto? Beats, bass, and bad vocals take the place of drums, guitars, and talented singing. So if you like something about this, more power to you, but I don't see what the big fuss is.

One doesn't think much about doom metal when they think of Russia, the former antagonist of the Western Hemisphere. Well, those folks should listen to Forest Stream. A three-member band with a drum machine (which is okay because I use a drum machine :) ), a powerful vocalist, and excellent guitar and keyboard work is what makes up this act. The band writes incredibly long, but NEVER boring, songs. The vocalist sounds a lot like Morten Veland (Sirenia, ex-Tristania), which is a very good thing. He also does some clean singing. The band is composed of 'Sonm the Darkest' (vocals, keys/programming), 'Wizard Omin' (guitars), and 'Silent Anth' (bass). The disc features nine songs and is slightly over an hour in length. Since CDNOW doesn't provide it, here's the track list:1. Autumn Elegy (3:53)2. Legend (8:08)3. Last Season Purity (12:16)4. Snowfall (9:55)5. Mel Kor (8:51)6. Whole (5:16)7. Black Swans (10:34)8. Winter Solstice (8:28)9. Steps of Mankind (1:37)I don't know if every version has this, but there's a bonus disc that comes with it, with nine sampler songs from Earache Records. Among these are demo versions of Forest Stream's &quot;Mel Kor&quot; and &quot;Black Swans,&quot; along with songs from Lunaris, Rakoth, Ephel Duath (2 songs each), and Without Face (1 song). Good stuff to say this really isn't a very expensive CD. The only downside is that there are some SLIGHT production flaws, but nothing like an old Emperor or Dimmu Borgir CD. It's just that the guitars don't sound as clean as they could.

This isn't bad for pop/punk music, but that's not saying much. I still am trying to figure out why I have a copy of this, even if it was only four bucks. There might be one or two good songs on here (especially the one she raps on... you're sure to get a good laugh out of that!), but most of the songs sound the same, and "Sk8er Boi" is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. I've never heard vocals kill an already mediocre piece of musicianship like that. "Complicated" was her only good song, and the only purpose it really serves is background noise for large gatherings. I love Weird Al's parody of it; she left herself wide open for that! At least Al's version has decent lyrics; Avril's songs are the most bland, repetitive, cliche, meaningless, and unimaginative in the entirety of the industry, save for rap (which really doesn't count as music).At first, I thought Avril was going to be something different; a respectable artist, not a tramp like Britney or Aguilera, and someone who played her own music. Well, it's quite obvious she's never been presented with the concept of voice lessons, and she doesn't actually play that guitar that she's always pictured as holding. She never plays it in the videos, and I'm told she makes lame excuses for not playing it at shows. I'm not patronizing Hilary Duff by any means, as she's as much a product of corporate zeal as the other "teen queen" dingbats, but when I heard that Avril came out and started talking trash about her for no reason at all, I thought to myself, "what's wrong with this girl?" Does Avril think she did something incredibly wonderful or original by being the first female Canadian skatepunk to make music? This "dissing" is ridiculous; these are supposed to be professional musicians, so they ought to act professional. You don't hear Marco Coti Zelati bashing Evanescence simply because the sounds of their bands are somewhat similar. Members of Iron Maiden don't chastise Jon Schaffer for making music similar to theirs, they praise his band's talent instead. This is how professionals should carry themselves. I think it's time for little Miss Lavigne to grow up, and if she's not willing to, then she should go back to building her sand castle. I actually thought she had some potential at first, but now I realize the only usefulness one could find in her would be to use her sweet, slender throat as a hand-warmer or squeeze toy. Who knows, maybe a little pressure on the vocal cords would help her voice out...In the end, "Let Go" is an example of corporate industry ruling the music industry. They put a pretty girl (and Avril is definitely good-looking) behind a guitar and microphone, and say to the MTV kids, "here's something different than Britney Spears." Yeah, so is Cradle of Filth. Yes, I'm comparing a pop-punk act to a satanic black metal outfit. But it's a good comparison; while Dani Filth may be accused of having the worst vocals in music, at least he puts some emotion into it, even if it is grotesque and unorthodox. Avril just sounds like a whiny little girl who lost her favorite Barbie doll. Dani's lyrics, while disturbing to many, are poetic and thought-provoking, whereas Avril's sound like they were written by a preschooler - and she doesn't even write half of them! Talent-wise, well, you can't say much about it because every song sounds like the previous track, and the musicianship sounds eerily similar to other "pop-punk" artists like blink-182. I could easily name at least 30 artists that the majority of you have probably never heard of that are aeons ahead of Avril in talent and professionalism. To sell this many records without the slightest hint of vocal talent and mediocre instrumental abilities signals a major problem with our music industry. Avril needs to grow up, take some voice lessons, teach her band how to play their instruments properly, and then try again.P.S.: I want my $$$$ back.

...and so is everyone else in Theatre of Tragedy! Why any band would kick out such a talented vocalist is beyond me. But then, bands all have their issues just like everyone else I guess...Anyway, onto the review. Leaves' Eyes is the byproduct of the marital partnership of Liv Kristine Espenaes and Alexander Krull. Through this new joining, the remainder of Alex's band Atrocity was drawn into the production of a new band, Leaves' Eyes. What you get is the gothic metal power provided by the five Atrocitians, plus the dynamic and breathtaking vocals of Liv Kristine. Leaves' Eyes differs vastly from other female-fronted bands such as Lacuna Coil and Within Temptation, who often shove obnoxiously loud female vocals out front and only use their instruments as an ambience. The band could function just fine without Liv, as they have shown throughout the entire Atrocity discography, whereas Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, and an alarming number of female-fronted bands wouldn't be able to survive if they lost their female singers. Liv's voice is sometimes very pop-ish, but not in a bad way. She does use the soprano pitch in a few cases ("Ocean's Way" being most notable). Alex Krull contributes with his well-placed synthesizer effects, which are not overdone but are used appropriately to create an additional rhythm and ethereal aura. He also lends his insanely well-developed extreme vocals on a few tracks. Unlike the Nightwish duets, which have never turned out well, every time Liv and Alex sing together, the sound is fluent and fantastic. I think he only growls on three or four songs, though. In this case, however, the lack of male vocals is not a bad thing, as Liv has a lot of variation in her voice. One thing that may put some off, however, is that she tends to be a little too breathy; methinks Alex could've done something about that in the production studio. But we can let it go; just a few hours after the vocal tracks were recorded, Liv popped out baby Leon Alexander (congrats, Mr. & Mrs. Krull)!Now, aside from the vocals, there is plenty to comment on. Despite the rich, deep texture of the guitars, which are tuned like doom metal guitars, there are some very well-done solos. Sometimes the rhythm guitar is a little too loud and the solo sounds muffled, though. The bass guitar parts are strong; somewhat simple, but worked into the music very well. As mentioned before, Alex does a very good job keeping the synths interesting but in check, and there are some keyboard pieces played by a guest musician on some of the softer songs. But the real treat is the drumming. It's not black-metal-style, but it's not the boring "beat--beat--beat-beat-beat" that some bands use.In the end, this is a must-have. Simply put, it's fantastic. Yes, Liv's lyrics are too romantic and over-the-top, but honestly I'd rather listen to that than any libertarian 'political' punk garbage. Buy this today if you like Liv's voice and if you like anything that Alexander Krull has ever produced.

I was sold by this band after 5 seconds off of one of the songs (I forget which) on their previous effort, Arcana. I was so impressed that I spent the full $25.49 to get this album new. Along with the $22 I wasted on a used copy of After Forever's Decipher, that's the most I've ever spent on a one-disc album. Unlike the previous purchase, this one was 100% worth it. Now, of the three Edenbridge albums, this one is the one I like least, because the songs are shorter and there seems to be a little too much power metal percussion. Also, they have some Nightwish-esque cheesy keyboard moments. However, that does not diminish the fact that it is still a great album, in every aspect. The thing that really upset me though is that, unlike their previous efforts, which were appreciable in length, this one only has two songs over five minutes in length. I didn't care too much for the addition of D.C. Cooper on the last song, but I generally don't care for male power metal vocalists (aside from Tony Kakko and, if you considered Iced Earth a power metal band like some folks do, Matt Barlow). So to be short and sweet, this album rocks, but be sure that you get Arcana first, or at least in the same order. And don't rule out their debut Sunrise in Eden, because these guys (and girl) have yet to produce an album that doesn't deserve a high rating.

Lacuna Coil's early work didn't impress me much, but this and Comalies did. I like this one because it takes the best elements of their old doom-metal style and blends it in with the heaviness that they capitalized on with Comalies. I also liked the inclusion of the EP Halflife, as it saves listeners some $ by putting them all on one album. The best tracks on here are &quot;To Live Is To Hide,&quot; &quot;Purify,&quot; &quot;Senzafine,&quot; and &quot;When A Dead Man Walks&quot; (all back-to-back). The second showing of &quot;Senzafine&quot; (I guess they decided to leave it on when they tacked Halflife onto the end) sounds a little different and is two seconds longer. I like the &quot;Trance Awake&quot; intro, but it sounds like something you'd hear at an ecstasy joint. The drummer, Cristiano Mozzati, is probably the musician (other than the vocalists) that stands out the most, as he puts a lot of complexity into his work, and it isn't just there to back up the guitars. Evanescence should take a hint from their superiors!This album also, unfortunately, signifies the last time that the band's two vocalists would be at their best. Andrea Ferro's vocals fell off considerably on Comalies, as he seemed to be trying to overdo himself. Both of them fell off lyrically after this, as Comalies is incredibly repetitive (even though I like it slightly better than this overall). Unleashed Memories is repetitive, but somehow or other, I don't tend to notice it as much. Must be because Cristina Scabbia's delivery is a lot smoother. Speaking of Cristina, for a 28-year-old woman (at the time), she's looking pretty good in the insert pics! Anyway, get this album and Comalies, but ask other reviewers about earlier stuff because it's a little too soft for me. A change in style did LC a lot of good.

My favorite film!This fascinating political suspense flick serves as a tribute to the fine work that President Kennedy and his advisors did, amidst military pressures for war, during the thirteen days of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Now, I wasn't around in '62, but it seems quite accurate from my point of view. In fact, the biggest 'mess-up' I could pick out was a quick glimpse of a C-130 Hercules (cargo plane) taxiing, wearing the current USAF paint scheme and not the 1960's SEA (Southeast Asia) camouflage or old Military Airlift Command colors! The computer-generated aircraft scenes did a little to detract from the realism, but there are no RF-8s, U-2Cs, or F-101s still flying, so at least the producers took the time to make the aircraft accurate. I did like the Vietnam-era carrier footage and the aircraft scrambles, however! Those were the real thing! By the way, if you haven't noticed, I'm quite the aviation nut. The cast line-up was pretty impressive: Kevin Costner as special assistant to the president Kenny O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK, Steven Culp (best known for his role as Clayton Webb on "J.A.G.") as Bobby Kennedy, Bill Smitrovich as Gen. Maxwell Taylor, Elya Baskin as Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, and a selection of other fine actors. This is probably the most underrated film I know of, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Cuban missile crisis or who enjoys political dramas.

This CD rocks. The guitar style blends together a very wide range of influence, from thrash to goth to industrial, and the synthesizers are done just right. Moonspell makes Type O Negative sound like cutout-bin material. The vocals are great for the most part; they're weak in some places, but I like the mix of deep clean vocals and mucusy death throes. Best song would have to be &quot;Nocturna&quot; although there are no weak ones. The Ozzy cover rocks too, I don't know why people keep complaining about it. Moonspell's vocalist (sorry, too lazy to go get the insert booklet) is better than Ozzy anyway. Drumming and bass are nothing to brag about, but they get the job done. Enjoyable, even if you're not one of those weirdos that wear all black...

I'm not a huge Dark Tranquillity fan, but nobody can deny their innovative approach to making music. After all, they were the creators of the Gothenberg style, along with close associates In Flames. Damage Done is a very good album. The bonus track, &quot;I, Deception&quot; is definitely the highlight. All of the songs are at least worthy of three stars, and averaged out, it's probably on the same playing field, if not a little better, than In Flames' newest offering. The major difference is that Dark Tranquillity has stuck to the melodic death metal formula, while In Flames has taken a more... I don't want to use the 'n-word' (nu-metal) because that denotes lack of talent and creativity... but not melodic death. Basically, lovers of the old Gothenberg metal scene should stick to Dark Tranquillity. Damage Done isn't their best album, but it still rocks.If there's one thing holding DT back, it's their damn vocalist...

...then Theatre of Tragedy's "Musique" would be a good listen. But it's not. Not unless you like electronica and trance-club music. Why the hell would they go from making good, thoughtful metal music to this no-talent-required electronic sludge? They cut most of the guitar parts out and replaced them with programming. I guess if you like stuff like Switchblade Symphony, you might like this, but old fans stay away. Raymond ought to give it up; where did he come up with the notion that he could sing in the first place? And what kind of IDIOT would take a talented vocalist (Liv Kristine) and make her sing stupid pop lines with a dorky robotic voice? Well, at least she did the right thing and left and sounds lots better in Leaves' Eyes.If you're a longtime TOT fan, stay far, far away. If you're a Britney wanna-be with a small guitar fetish, you'll like it. If you respect talent, get the old albums.

Load is a step backwards after the Black Album and earlier works such as Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning, but the band was &quot;changing with the times&quot; so to say, basically selling out. But Metallica has (or should I say, had) the ability to &quot;sell out with style,&quot; as Load is still a very enjoyable album. Highlight tracks are: &quot;Ain't My B!tch,&quot; &quot;The House Jack Built,&quot; &quot;Until It Sleeps,&quot; &quot;King Nothing,&quot; and &quot;Bleeding Me.&quot; Otherwise, it's all decent material, but nothing for the band to brag about. I don't really have much to say about it, except that if you're open-minded, you're going to find at least something you like about Load.

While there are some production issues with this album, Metallica shows their true colors this time around, and even without Cliff Burton (RIP), they manage to pull off a masterpiece that was characteristic of their career up until the mid-90s. The new bassist doesn't contribute much, but he got better in time for the black album. The title track is undoubtedly the best song on this CD, but every other track is worthy of your listening time. I personally feel &quot;One&quot; is one of their more overrated tracks, but it's got good lyrics, and while it sounds just a little too folkish at times for my tastes, it's still a very good song. See, at one time Metallica was able to produce a high-quality album, instead of the nu-metal they make these days. If you haven't already gotten your hands on a copy of this, I invite you to do so now.

This isn't the Metallica that fans have grown to love. This is cutout-bin material that should've never wound up on a CD. There is no emotion (other than anger, hence the title) portrayed, just unorganized and poor-sounding noise to go along with the horrible vocals with no meaning whatsoever. Nu-metal fans will love this; it's got about as much to offer as a System of a Down album -- nothing. If you liked anything Metallica made before "ReLoad" and want to retain a favorable image of the once-proud band, then stay as far away from this junk as you can. Heck, even if you somehow or other did manage to like "Garage Inc.", you shouldn't waste your money on this. You'd think that, in the six years it's taken Hetfield, Ulrich, and company to come up with a new album, that they'd actually sit down, put down their beer, and write an album with some instrumental complexity and lyrical meaning. I think this album confirms many a Metallica fan's worst nightmare: the band is burnt out, and they're headed further and further down the drain. I can't believe this was the same band that wrote and produced such magnificent songs as "Fade To Black" and "The Unforgiven." The song "Shoot Me Again" basically sums up how I felt after listening (thoroughly, I might add) to this... album.

A double CD composed entirely of a collection of, for the most part, poorly done covers. Is this what we expect from Metallica, a band that is supposed to have great songwriting ability of their own? Not at all. Two of the covers (&quot;Turn The Page&quot; and &quot;Loverman&quot;) are very good, but the others either just weren't meant for Metallica (such as the Skynyrd cover) or shouldn't have even been attempted. Now, I personally don't like covers; I'd rather hear a band release only its own work, because originality is most of the reason to like a band. I guess if you like covers, you'll like this one, but if you've been disappointed with the recent Metallica downfall (I'd say that it was after Load that they started going down, because I actually do have somewhat of a liking for Load), don't expect a relief from the plague in Garage, Inc.

Let me begin by saying that I despise Stratovarius, everything they believe in and their entire musical theory. But being an open-minded listener, I heard &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (their most popular song, and indeed, by far their best) and was shocked by it. This prompted me to open up a little to these Finns, so I bought Visions, Destiny, and Elements 1. Destiny was a waste, and Elements 1 was mediocre, but something about Visions just stood out like a shining light in a dark hall... or like a beautiful blood-covered girl in bondage in a dark room (sorry, sadist fetishes popping into mind). This one seems to have a lot more character to it. The vocals aren't nearly as annoying, and they don't push the atheist stuff like they do in Elements 1. Of course, I still don't consider it a high-value item in my music collection, and I don't have anything against those who like it, because different tastes in music is what makes artists great. The band has talent, but I've said it before and I'll say it again, they get a lot more credit than other bands who deserve it just as much, if not more. So check out the cdnow.com samples, see if you like it, then tell me if my slightly-biased but honest review helped out. Okay, you don't really have to tell me.

In case you're wondering, I do NOT have a predisposition to dislike artists from the Netherlands. It's just that I haven't been impressed by any of these &quot;marvelous, unbeatable&quot; bands like Within Temptation (sorry, but I don't understand why people say they have a good singer - and this is coming from a trained vocalist) and After Forever. But I'm always open to something new, so I tried out Epica. Like After Forever, Mark J. tries too hard to be 'unique,' only to shroud himself in a gown of cliches so thick you could asphyxiate a hippo with it. Come on, choirs and orchestras? Sure, six years ago, when the first Tristania albums came out, choirs in metal were a novelty (and performed in a way so that they stood out). Orchestras were great when Winds and Penumbra were doing them, or when the symphonic black metal movement was in its nativity. But now, EVERYONE and their mother is recruiting an orchestra and a choir to help their band. Now, this is fine, it's just that in most cases, such as this one, YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM! And when you can, you can't distinguish the orchestra from the synthesizer, and the choir just sounds like the female singer doing voice-overs. Like After Forever, they need to make much more use of the male vocalist (who if I'm not mistaken is the infamous Mr. Jansen), because he has a very effective and well-developed growl. Now, the female singer: Not as good as Floor from After Forever, but FAR better than that whiner in Within Temptation. She sounds like she's struggling at times, but doesn't get off-key. But the thing that really makes this band better than the two aforementioned artists is that their guitars actually sound like guitars! With WT and on After Forever's Decipher (the only one of their albums I have so far), the guitars get drowned out by the keyboards, giving them a very transparent and toned-down sound. Epica's got the keyboards and guitars at perfect volumes, so that each instrument seems to complement the other.So in the end... if you're one of those who loves After Forever, then I'm pretty sure you'll like Epica too. They are certainly a good band, especially if you don't pay any attention to the oh-so-original (I've never been more sarcastic in my life) lyrics and concepts. So, check these guys (and gal) out; you might be surprised.

Symphony X introduced me to progressive power metal, and thanks to them, I've began experimenting with other bands of the genre. Of the three SX albums I own (this one, &quot;Odyssey,&quot; and &quot;Twilight In Olympus&quot;), this is my personal favorite, just slightly edging out &quot;Odyssey.&quot; There are at least three songs that I'd categorize as timeless classics on here (&quot;The Accolade,&quot; &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; [the whole 20 minutes of it], and &quot;Candlelight Fantasia.&quot; I've stated in another review that I'm not an authority on power metal, so this review could be directed at those like me just getting a foot in the door with this genre. Buy this, you won't be disappointed.

This album could've been much better, but it certainly is nothing for Three 6 to be ashamed of. My biggest criticism is actually the most popular song, "Sippin On Some Syrup." I would've liked to have heard the rest of Three 6 rapping on it, and UGK left off. In the end, there are too many weak spots, and not enough good songs to make up for it. Basically, WTSC is an "easy-listening" rap album (although 99.9% of rap albums are), not like their early material, which you could get into a little more. Take it to your parties and play it on the road, but don't try to get attached.

There is one small downside to this album, and that is its volume. It's recorded a lot lower than most metal CDs I own, so when I pop it out of the CD player (usually to put Beyond The Veil or the Sirenia album in), the next one blasts the speakers out! But such a minor defect could not kill a darn-near perfect album. Widow's Weeds is rather slow, and guitar critics will probably hate it for the simplicity of the use of that instrument, but for those who look at the big picture instead of concentrating on one small facet, you're in for a big treat. The songwriting is very poetic; not aggressive like the later and slightly better Beyond The Veil, but more or less romantic, in a dark sort of way. Morten Veland wrote all the lyrics this time, so the singing is much more melodic than on the songs that Einar wrote on BTV.The Preludium and Postludium are a nice touch, but I tend to skip them when listening. The first full-length song, "Evenfall," is one of the most majestic songs ever written. It features powerful choirs combined with Morten's rich, deep growling, and seeing as all the vocals are interwoven perfectly, it's one that can be played over and over in its nearly seven-minute entirety. "Pale Enchantress" takes a while to get into, but is the first we get to hear Vibeke Stene as a solo vocalist. "December Elegy" features much more of Vibeke's vocals and is more mellow, with heavier parts thrown in and mixed perfectly. It also has a beautiful segue in the middle with (synthesized) flutes, violins, and Vibeke whispering. "Midwintertears" is the longest song, at eight and a half minutes. It's very melodic but not really the heaviest song. "Angellore" is different than the other songs; the guitars are a little faster and less bassy, and it features the clean male vocals of Osten Bergoy. "My Lost Lenore" features a nice piano opening, along with very ethereal female vocal parts featuring Vibeke whispering with the choir singing in the background. "Wasteland's Caress" is another standout track, and is the most aggressive. It has faster guitars, more prominent drumming, and features Morten opting for more of a black-metal scream than a death growl.A lot of people complain about the use of extreme vocals. My advice for them is, if you don't like the music, don't listen to it. Did it ever occur to you that that's how they WANT to make their music? If you only want the pretty female voice, listen to Nightwish or something like that. As a musician, I appreciate the fact that true passionate musicians make music the way THEY like it, not the way some loudmouth critics tell them to. That's my $0.02 on that matter, you can take it for what it's worth. For the people who aren't going to whine and complain about the vocals, give this CD a try, because even if you don't really like the music, you can't say they didn't put their hearts and souls into this masterful recording.

I had been listening to Borknagar's previous masterpiece Empiricism relentlessly before I picked this up, and was really expecting a progression with Epic. Well, first of all the guitar work sounds muffled, and while I can't deny Asgeir Mickelson's drum talents, he does tend to be somewhat repetitive. Vintersorg's clean singing is too high-pitched in some places. It certainly isn't bad per se, but I just expected more from Borknagar. Maybe it'll grow on me...

That's sad... the hardest part about writing this review was coming up with a title...The Two Towers was a good film to begin with... but the extra 43 minutes was definitely worth sitting through! I normally don't even like this type of movie, but now that I've seen all three, the LOTR trilogy ranks among my favorite films of all time. Peter Jackson did a lot right with these films, even if they do deviate slightly from Tolkien's books. First of all, he surrounded himself with capable actors/actresses. No performer puts in a bad acting performance, and the people chosen to play the particular characters fit the roles very well. Second, the music is phenomenal. Music is one of the most important non-visual atmospheric impact parts in any movie, and Jackson realized that in the making of this film. The music is melancholic most of the way, and where in most films you'd expect a bold, triumphant orchestra piece, here you've got a sorrowful violin solo. Great effect.The filmmaking and script writing was great, and I think everyone who's tired of the meaningless pop-culture junk the motion picture industry is turning out these days should watch this.

Black metal isn't my favorite subgenre of metal, but there's something about Cradle of Filth that keeps my interest. Maybe it's their flawless musical integration, or maybe it's Dani Filth's disturbingly poetic lyrics. But they kick bum, no matter how "commercialized" they've made the genre. Bitter Suites to Succubi does seem a little rushed, and has a good deal of sound contradiction in it, but overall, it's one of my more favored COF albums. "Black Goddess Rises II" is probably my favorite song, and the instrumental "Sin Deep My Wicked Angel" (I love using that phrase) is good as are most COF instrumental segues. "Suicide and Other Comforts" is one of the better songs as well. Basically, there aren't any really bad songs, but instead of taking all the negative criticism as definitive, I'd listen to some samples or maybe go to one of those music stores that lets you sample the CD before you buy it, and then make your final decision. That's what you should be doing anyway. But if you're truly a Filth fan, you will probably find it at least somewhat appealing to your darkside.

Metal purists and patrons of the '80s Metallica sound are, in my opinion, unjustly harsh on this album. There is only one poor song on the entire album ("Holier Than Thou"). In the eyes of open-minded listeners such as myself, it retains full legitimacy as a metal album, and though it features a more commercial sound and less offensive lyrics (except in "The God That Failed") and features shorter songs, it is by no means a bad production. Metallica was never in the game for the underground crowd, they wanted to make money, and this was the album that did it for them. However, unlike current "metal" bands, the band did not "sell out" to achieve its fame, but instead, gave the public a masterpiece of musicianship that let everyone know what the genre was made of.Fans of older Metallica definitely criticize the shortness of the tracks. While Metallica did play some great songs that were quite lengthy, these could get a little tedious at times. One of my personal favorites, "Don't Tread On Me," is only four minutes long. That would be an interlude by early Metallica standards. Other great tracks are "Sad But True," "The God That Failed" (musically, not conceptually or lyrically), "The Unforgiven," and "My Friend of Misery." "Nothing Else Matters" is a nice ballad, but takes too long to get into. The other tracks, except "Holier Than Thou" and "The Struggle Within" are above-average. My only real complaint with this is that Lars' drumming doesn't really stand out on many of the songs.In the end, Metallica deserved all the credit they got for this one. If you don't like it, then you're perfectly entitled to your opinion. But if you're just senselessly bashing it simply because Metallica matured and changed, then you need to start speaking your own mind and stop trying to appease the purists.

Before this review is started, let it be known that I LOVE Virgin Black's first album Sombre Romantic. I love it to death. So, obviously I was expecting the same greatness from their follow-up.First thing I noticed, before even popping the disc in the CD player, is that the songwriting is not nearly up to par with Sombre Romantic's. While Virgin Black is NOT a Christian band, as some have said they are (they're pretty darn anti-Christian if their lyrics say anything about them), at least their first album had some meaning instead of the cliche &quot;God, you've made my life a living hell&quot; that this one says for all intensive purposes. But that's a minor issue. Now onto the music. They surely have abandoned most of their metal influences, instead becoming quite content to produce something that the 'goth' crowd would surely get a kick out of. I admire the classical influences, but in reality, the only one doing anything for this band is Rowan London. Unfortunately, he's the showcase of the album. Why do I say unfortunately? Because a great deal of the time, he's the ONLY member playing anything. I will certainly not contest that he's got hands made for the piano and a throat carved for singing, but the whole purpose of having a *band* is to have every member contribute something. Their drummer is still way out of time with the rest of the band, too. He's good, but should practice keeping time a little more.Rowan's vocals seem to be turned down a notch from Sombre Romantic. In some of the songs, he sounds like sten Bergy (Morendoes/Tristania), which isn't a bad thing, but I certainly like to hear his operatic vocals take center stage. As for the music itself, it could be compared to Burzum's Hliskjalf in terms of the atmosphere created (although this has vocals and guitars, so that takes some away from its ethereal essence), so it's a pretty dark and haunting piece, although I think I'd play this one before Sombre Romantic as bedtime music. The orchestration and instrumentation is very good, but more simplistic. I'd say they probably could've gotten away with just one guitarist on this album, because the guitar isn't used all too often as a lead instrument. The leads are definitely there, but as the average song length is about eight or nine minutes (&quot;The Everlasting&quot; is a drawn-out 17 minutes), they show up relatively sparingly throughout the duration of the album. This is offset by the fact that the piano/keyboard work is phenomenal. The songs do get a little long for a gothic band, in the vein of The Sins of Thy Beloved, albeit with far better structure and euphonics.What will the future hold for Virgin Black? Well, if they decide to pop out another album, I'm sure I'll get hold of a copy, but it certainly won't be on the top ten segment of my wish list. All things considered, this was worth the money I paid for it, but just seems to lack the passion and inspiration of Sombre Romantic. Worth your money if you liked the first album, but just don't expect a repeat.

First of all, I must say I love the title. Second, the music, as with most of My Dying Bride's work, is phenomenal. Even though I've always felt that Aaron Stainthorpe was the bane of MDB, he can't destroy their masterful works. The opening track, "The Cry of Mankind," is one of my favorite MDB songs ever. The only complaint I have with this album is the live tracks. They were a nice addition, but they don't sound quite that good. Anyway, I recommend The Angel and the Dark River to any fan of good dark metal.

I cannot believe I spent money on this talentless [material]. I shall never forgive myself. So this is what popular rap is all about... horrible, unoriginal, infantile lyricism with slurred vocals with no fluency whatsoever? Just because they can produce "tight" beats (aside from "Still Fly," I think the beats [are unacceptable])? Anyone can learn to produce beats, and it'll take them about a week. If you want to talk about talent, show me someone who can a) sing and b) play an instrument. That is talent. ... "Still Fly" is the only song that is anywhere near decent. And you have to love the "variety" of material presented in this... money, drugs, sex, killing. This is why I've moved away from rap and into more meaningful genres of music.

"Ghetto Cowboy" may be the most innovative rap song ever made, and a very brave attempt on the part of Bone, as rap fans rarely want to hear anything not gang-related, but otherwise, they threw a whole lot of slop onto this one. There are other good songs, but not enough to really make it a standout. Rap is a generally bland genre by nature, but Bone & Mo Thugs were always able to make their presence somewhat of a refreshment from the dirge of gangster themes and "pimping" tunes. Here's a breakdown of what was going on with this one:1. Mo Thug Intro - just a little intro, not really deserving of a rating.2. Mighty Mighty Warrior (3/5) - nothing really spectacular, although Souljah Boy's screaming of "like Vagisil cream all over your uterus" was pretty funny. One of Wish Bone's better moments.3. Mighty Mo Thug (2/5) - Souljah Boy sounds very much like Mystikal, and that's not really a good thing coming from me. Layzie Bone does some good for this one.4. Heart Of It (3/5) - This gets a good rating for its nice, relaxing beat. Skant's voice is really annoying and Layzie Bone sounds like he's dying with lung cancer.5. The Queen (5/5) - Nice way to introduce the prettiest rapper there ever was. Thug Queen's little girl voice didn't do much to make her sound "tough," though. Krayzie handles the chorus quite well.6. Riot (0/5) - Flesh-n-Bone can't handle a song by himself. It sounds like he keeps saying the same things over and over again in the exact same rhyme scheme. That's why his solo albums were such blunders.7. All Good (5/5) - Felecia is beautiful, and unlike many popular R&B; singers, she can actually SING. Krayzie Bone puts in a nice rap at the end. Very catchy club song.8. Ghetto Cowboy (5/5) - Undoubtedly the most creative rap song ever written. The harmonica in the background gives a nice touch. Interesting story about old Western outlaws.9. Believe (0/5) - Can you say BORING? MT5 lacks any kind of talent, like the sledge of R&B; guys out there like Usher & 112, who just stand up there and attempt to sing so they can woo the girls. Krayzie & Layzie help out a tiny bit, but not enough to make it listenable.10. Urban Souljah (5/5) - Graveyard Shift's introspective raps were the highlight of anything by Mo Thugs (if you can find their underground album, get your hands on it). The live acoustic guitar is a wonderful touch, and Tombstone's gruff rapping combined with Sin's sinister sound and mind-grabbing lyrics (not in ebonics!) make this one the best song on the album.11. Ain't Said No Names (1/5) - Krayzie Bone goes out of his way to talk trash about 'artists' like Do or Die & Crucial Conflict. I wish they'd put the whole "style-stealing" thing aside, because it didn't take any musical genius to rhyme words really fast.12. Mo Thuggin' (0/5) - Poetic Hustla'z came out with an unbelievable solo album (Trials & Tribulations), but they always sound horrible on the compilation albums. This one's no different. The 'blues' music they were using sounds terrible, and I don't think Boogy Nikke could've said "motherf**ker" any more in his verse.13. U Don't Own Me (0/5) - Wow, this is awful. It sounds like one of those '80s jazz/R&B; songs that put you to sleep. Potion should've been dropped.14. Ride With a Playa (0/5) - Anything by Ken Dawg is sure to be boring, as he's afraid of heavy beats and has to use mellow stuff. Every song of his has the word "playa" in the title. This song is bland and has nothing to offer.15. Pimpin' Ain't Easy (0/5) - Sampling a Marvin Gaye song and talking about female pimping... only II Tru. Jhaz & Brina should've hung it up long ago (and fortunately, they since have).16. Otherside (1/5) - Bad way to end the album. The song features most of the Mo Thugs Family, but the beat is too much like that '70s jazz/R&B; they were trying to use so much. Kinda upbeat, but nothing good in the way of vocals.In the end, it's not a very good album on the part of Bone Thugs N Harmony or Mo Thugs themselves, but none of the Mo Thug albums have been that good. If you're hardcore into rap or a big Bone fan, you should consider it, but if you're just a casual, once-in-a-great-while rap listener as I've become, just get the "Ghetto Cowboy" single and try your darndest to find that Graveyard Shift underground tape (they do rap properly - live guitars, interesting lyrics, none of that "yo yo yo" ebonics). So many junk songs thrown onto an album that started out having potential... Well, as we've seen, Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, and Steve Lobel are some of the sleaziest businessmen in the rap industry, up there with D.J. Paul & Juicy J.

This is a fairly mediocre product from three musicians that have no appeal to me (call me a heretic but I don't like Katatonia at all) and one who I used to think only worked with intelligent music (Akerfeldt). Well, everyone has their not-so-bright side, and this was Mike's. Come on, brutal death metal made by three doom/atmospheric guys and a melodic death singer? The vocals are the best part, but it turns out that this is the only time that Mike's clear growling is a bane, because the lyrics aren't all that much better than Six Feet Under's (except these guys try to sound serious). The guitar distortion doesn't appeal at all; it's like they were trying to do with one guitar what should've been done with two, so they distort the bejeezus out of the one they have in hopes that it sounds 'heavy' enough. But the ultimate worst part is the drumming. Extreme metal requires extreme drummers, and Dan Swano just doesn't cut it. He just plays a beat here and a beat there; no blastbeats (which is acceptable seeing as this is death and not black metal) and no complex schemes, just &quot;I'm on drums because they needed a drummer&quot; desperation playing. The bass is drowned out by the guitar distortion.It has good points, because it beats the hell out of Mortician or any of that, but it's not high on my list of recommendations. It's one of those albums you pop in when you need a brutality fix and maybe a little laugh, but that's about it.

Why does Iced Earth produce a cover album worth every penny of its price when the more popular (or, should I say, overrated?) Metallica produces one that's barely above cutout-bin level? Simple - Iced Earth is true to metal; they are one of the last bands that plays metal in its true, pure form. No programming, no special effects, just pure instrumental mastery and vocal supremacy. How do you choose a favorite amongst so many classics? I'd personally say that the two Iron Maiden covers simply blow everything else out of the water (particularly "Hallowed Be Thy Name"), but the covers of Alice Cooper's "Dead Babies", KISS's "God of Thunder," and Blue Oyster Cult's "Burnin' For You" (one of the only good songs BOC ever made) are up there as well. I don't like "Screaming For Vengeance," but I've never been much of a Judas Priest fan. The AC/DC covers sound a little awkward in Iced Earth style compared to their original format, but this band is able to do things with them so that they still sound good, even if different from the originals. The Black Sabbath cover is pretty good as well. As I said, there aren't any bad tracks, it's just that some are better than others. Jon Schaffer and company pay a brilliant tribute to their biggest inspirations with this masterpiece of a metal album.

Cadaveria's second album is an improvement over the first - and it plays in my computer! Anyway they don't have Baron Harkonnen as keyboardist anymore, but there are synths, just played by a guest musician. They're still a pretty ugly band (except the lady herself) and their music isn't pretty, but it's very powerful. There is some acoustic guitar use on &quot;Vox of Anti-Time.&quot; If you want to get these but can't on Amazon, go to The End Records' web site. That's where I got both of my Cadaveria CDs. The music structures on this one are about the same as on The Shadows' Madame, but the composition is better and the instruments and vocals have improved. It's powerful, but still melodic. If you need an alternative to Cradle of Filth, this is high on my list of recommendations.

I was dragged to the theatrical version of this film by a bunch of girls who wanted to see a movie with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and wasn't really expecting much out of it, particularly since it was a Disney film. Well, it was a good film indeed, although I have to say the major downfall was Bloom's character. I won't dispute his acting talent, but the character he played was the same old cliche Disney romantic bumbling bonehead with silly lines and a really comical composition. Depp's performance was darn good; to play a character who was so out-there, and to do it with style, that takes skills. Geoffrey Rush makes a great villain, even though the film doesn't do a whole lot to antagonize his character. And then there's Keira Knightley... she may be the most beautiful girl alive, but she also has acting talent, and unlike many of her colleagues, she doesn't need to rely on her looks to gain her glory. The less important actors came out with mixed results, but the Commodore and the governor were, sorry to say, not very good. The music was pretty good, but I think it could've been stronger. I could just imagine them using the intro to Dimmu Borgir's &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot; (which was done with an orchestra) in the battle scenes! Anyway, although they had to make Orlando Bloom's character a typical Disney bozo, it really is a pretty good film. Very out-there, but entertaining enough.

I know everyone says that this is probably Three 6 Mafia's best effort so far, but I stand on the opposite side. Yes, there are plenty of classics ("Tear Da Club Up '97," "Late Nite Tip" [which was carried over from "The End"], "Gunclaps," "Who Got Dem 9's," etc.), but there seems to be a load of weak material ("N 2 Deep," which sounded great in its original form but sounds horrible with the new beat; "Hit A Mutha*****," "Motivated") thrown into the mix. Koopsta and Gangsta Boo put in disappointing performances compared to what they did on the previous album, and the other four do well but don't shine to their fullest. Overall, it seems like it was rushed. After all, it was released less than a year after "The End." To top it all off, the artwork in the CD insert is just painfully gross. I mean, PURPLE??? This is supposed to be a hardcore rap group! Anyway, you should have this if you're a Three 6 fan, just because the good does outweigh the bad. Just don't look inside the insert booklet too much!

Okay, you're probably thinking &quot;what the hell are you doing listening to doom metal if you don't like slow music,&quot; right? Well, the reason is, I like metal. Don't care what subgenre it is, I like metal. And I do like this CD, but would've liked it better if they upped the tempo a notch to maybe an old Tristania level. But it's their music; they like it slow, and that's cool. It is good, but the guitar work seems a little lacking for a piece that's mainly instrumental. The synthesizers make up for it, but even they are fairly simplistic. The vocals aren't very good, but the music generally makes up for it. If you like slow music, you'll like this.

Why do people keep comparing this band to Opeth??? Opeth isn't the only band to write 10-minute songs, throw tempo changes at you, and switch between clean and extreme vocals!I bought this, not expecting an Opeth clone, and with expectations of something fairly mellow and melancholic. It has a lot of those elements, but it also has its strong parts. The bass guitar really stands out in some songs, even though they concentrate on the acoustic. You also have to love a song that has deer antler percussion in it ("The Lodge"). It's really great to see an American band that hasn't followed the road of commercialism; this trio really has a lot going for them. Their lyrics are influenced heavily by naturalism, Native American scripture, and folkish literature. Haughm should use more clean vocals; I love his black-scream, but in my humble opinion, he's got the best clean male vocals in the music industry. He's not overdone or overly emotive. He is also a very good lyricist; he pens lyrics that deal with his naturalistic-religious viewpoint, but he does so without making unwarranted attacks on the more 'traditional' religions. This is a good thing and I certainly prefer bands who incorporate their beliefs into their lyrics but at the same time respect those of others (which is why I wasn't pleased with their choice of the Sol Invictus cover on their previous album, but it's all good). There's none of that silly 'evil' satanic junk on here either. This is an album that is all about the music, not the image, and is very professional in all aspects.So, in the end, you must buy this CD and support this band. The standout songs are "In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion" and "You Were But a Ghost in my Arms" but there are no bad tracks and it can be played in its 70-minute entirety over and over. Once again, there is no hint of Opeth in these songs aside from the lengths and vocal structures. I'd say this is more neofolk than anything and it can hardly be categorized as melodic death. I honestly like this better than anything by Opeth, sorry to offend all ye Opeth worshippers. Agalloch is more focused and uses the vocal styles more appropriately, not to mention better acoustic guitar work and a more sensual atmosphere. This is not to say I don't like Opeth, because they're also one of my favorite bands, but I just like Agalloch better. Heck, I'm only making a comparison between them because everyone else has got it stuck in their minds that the two sound alike. Highly Recommended, A+ quality music.

I can understand people accustomed to earlier works, particularly Midian, being disappointed with this album, as it is a sort of change in style. But I see nothing wrong with it. Having less of Sarah Jezebel Deva isn't such a bad thing now that Dani is able to weave his vocals into the music. The interludes are a nice touch as well. Lyrically, it's as sick, twisted, and disturbing as ever, but I mean that as a compliment. Best songs are &quot;Serpent Tongue,&quot; &quot;Better To Reign In Hell,&quot; and &quot;Thank God For The Suffering.&quot; &quot;Mannequin&quot; is good too but sounds totally contrary to anything COF has ever done. Go get it.

In all honesty, my first instinct to buy this was the fact that Jason William Walton (bassist for Agalloch and many others) is on it. It had some other big names that I thought would make it good, like Paul Kuhr of Novembers Doom and Andy Winter of Winds, but since I am a die-hard Agalloch fan, it was mainly JWW. Anything he touches seems to turn gold. Subterranean Masquerade's two-track EP "Temporary Psychotic State" is no exception. This is a beautiful mix of prog-rock, folklore, and a little bit of metal. As one critic once said, "this is the kind of music Opeth should still be making." I wouldn't go that far, since Opeth is still rocking hard, but it really gives an idea of how great this band is. There are a few instances of classical instruments, mainly violin, and unlike a lot of the 'doom metal' bands, these violins are actually played well. They sound very traditional; maybe not as traditional as the ones you'll hear in Korpiklaani, but the next closest thing. Very folklore-ish. There are some female vocals that I don't care for, but they don't hurt. All in all, this is something that fans of prog rock and metal should have in their collection. Calling all Opeth, Green Carnation, etc. fans to pick one up today!

Draconian's debut on Napalm Records had potential, but they show too much of their influences and not enough of their own creativity. Combine this with a female vocalist that's nothing more than eye candy and stupid satanic lyrics that feature the same woefully overdone weepy doom dying-rose-romance antics and anti-Christian propaganda, and you start to think to yourself, "maybe I'll just put My Dying Bride back on." The band sounds like a cross between My Dying Bride, Tristania, and Opeth. They open the disc with a nearly thirteen-minute doom metal overture, called "The Cry of Silence" (no doubt influenced by a My Dying Bride song that isn't much shorter and has a strikingly similar name, maybe?), going into the Opeth/Dark Tranquillity-influenced "Silent Winter." The latter was the first I'd heard of Draconian, and it didn't do anything for me. The best song is "The Amaranth," which is ruined by the raucous, poorly-executed male growling. The girl sings a lot of it, although as I said she's not really that good.If you want doom, buy My Dying Bride or In the Woods instead. If you want gothic, buy Tristania or How Like A Winter instead. if you want melodeath, buy Opeth instead. This band could be good if they'd drop the stupid cliche satan crap (their next album is supposedly going to be a concept album about, you guessed it, Satan) and concentrate on making original songs with above-average musicianship. Instead, they come off as little more than an amateurish gallery of influence.

Fiend kills what Three 6 did well with. He isn't too bad on "Head Bussaz" but he ruins most of the other material. Juicy's pitiful attempts at singing don't help either. In the end, it's Juice Man's rapping on about half the tracks and D.J. Paul that save it.

I admit, when Genesis recruited Phil Collins to replace Peter Gabriel, they lost most of their progressive aura and eventually sold out and started making boring love songs, but this wasn't where it happened. This album still retains a hint of progressivism, but it is much more radio-friendly, especially since it incorporated the hit &quot;That's All.&quot; Dark personalities should find something intriguing about &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Home By The Sea,&quot; while &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; is a rather funny song (Collins' attempt at a latino accent fails miserably, though!) and &quot;Silver Rainbow&quot; is very... well, out there. The ballads don't exactly find favor with your humble critic, but I'm sure there are those who will like them. Here's a breakdown of what you'll get:1. Mama (5/5) - A very dark, haunting song with lyrics that will make you think, in true Genesis heritage-style.2. That's All (5/5) - One of the band's most popular songs; very upbeat, but will without doubt be looked down upon by purists.3. Home By The Sea (5/5) - Another dark song, with disturbing lyrics. One of my favorite Genesis songs of all time.4. Second Home By The Sea (5/5) - The band displays their musical talent to the fullest in this six-minute instrumental.5. Illegal Alien (4/5) - A song definitely not meant to be taken seriously. Rather humorous, but the vocal delivery kills it.6. Taking It All Too Hard (1/5) - Boring ballad; I always skip this one.7. Just A Job To Do (5/5) - Sounds to me like an old-time gangster/Mafia anthem; aeons better than any dumb rap song with the same concept!8. Silver Rainbow (5/5) - This song has a very good instrumental, but the lyrics are very intriguing. I have no idea what it's supposed to be about, but it's good.9. It's Gonna Get Better (2/5) - This one talks about poverty, and while a noble subject, the band doesn't do too well with it.The end verdict is:If you're a fan of the Gabriel era, then you'll probably want to stay away from this one and go for the Peter Gabriel solo albums. But if you're open-minded and don't mind the change, then Genesis' self-titled masterpiece is definitely the album for you. It really does have something for everyone, even the prog lovers. It isn't as smooth as earlier albums, as it pretty much encompasses everything the band has ever attempted (i.e., ballads, prog, upbeat pop, etc.), but that means it stays interesting and you're not hearing the same thing over and over again. Definitely recommended.

Lacuna Coil is now at the forefront of the metal genre in my humble opinion, but back when they were still doing the &quot;atmospheric rock&quot; thing, they weren't so appealing. I gave this 4 stars simply because I think I gave my Gathering CD 4 stars too and I must emphasize that Lacuna is FAR better than the Gathering (overrated, HORRIBLE vocalist, unoriginal). I'm just not a big fan of overdone mellowness. Now, I love when metal bands perform ballads, and Lacuna's softer songs on Unleashed Memories and Comalies have far more appeal to me than the ones on this one since those two albums are mostly metal and this one is fairly mellow the whole way through. I won't say this is bad, or that it doesn't deserve the 4 stars I gave it, but I do like the Coil's newer stuff a lot better. Cristina just keeps getting better, while the lyrics don't do much for me and Andrea keeps getting worse, but those are minor defects and can't bring down the value of the overall product. The band's most important asset aside from Cristina (in my opinion) is drummer Cristiano Mozzati, as he's one of the best drummers in any band (again, in my humble opinion). Get this album if you're an atmospheric rock fan, but get the new stuff first if you lean more toward metal.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this film, but I got it just because it featured Count Filth as an actor, and I knew that at least would be entertaining in itself. Well, Dani should do more horror films. He's good at killing people, and as you'll see in one part, eating cat innards (take that, ASPCA!!!). It's lots of blood and guts, and the storyline takes some time to make sense of, but if you're a fan of Cradle of Filth or you love bloody movies, then you should watch this. The snuff addict is really funny!

Tech N9ne hates the mainstream, but he sure goes out of his way to be a part of it. He's nothing spectacular, his beats are typical hip-hop junk, and his lyrics are dumb. Why would he brag about first having sex at the age of five? Maybe to a complete loser, that's respectable, but not to anyone with any type of basic human decency. This is ordinary, unimaginative rap, and while he goes fast sometimes, he basically sounds like Mystikal with a hint of harmony. Nothing evil about this.

If you want to listen to 28 songs that sound EXACTLY the same, then get this album. Sure it's heavy, but so are Meshuggah and Dimmu Borgir. But those bands play with skill and talent, and aren't this shambled, chaotic, talentless "grindcore" garbage. This takes as much talent as it takes to make a rap CD - NONE. They walk into the studio, hook up a huge amplifier, start playing random chords and [bad] drumming, and grunt out some lines about sticking knives in people. Face it, the best thing about this album is the cover artwork. Mortician may be heavy, but heaviness in the absence of skill is nothing. Save your $.

T-Rock managed to put out a decent album even after leaving Three 6 Mafia's Hypnotize Camp Posse. It's not wonderful, and the best thing about it is the beats, but T-Rock has good delivery and is somewhat intelligent about lyrics at times. All too often, though, it's what you'd hear out of a typical rap album. But at least there's variety.

Unpredictable is an understatement. This band throws in so many tempo changes and vocal style switches that they make even Opeth seem predictable! Unfortunately, they don't always put the changes together without some rigidity, but the nice thing about that is that it catches you off guard, and you won't fall asleep. Of course, with these guys (and girl), you're not going to fall asleep, because they keep it nice and heavy. They do a little thrash deal mixed in with black metal, so don't expect a Dimmu Borgir sound, and while it's not a very evil sound, it sure as hell isn't for pansies. Cadaveria is an amazing vocalist (and she's hot too), and unlike other extreme female vocalists (*cough* Angela Gossow), she actually maintains a hint of femininity even in her most extreme moments. She does the clean vocals well, and the screams sound absolutely possessed. The band uses keyboards, but they don't overpower the guitars like in some bands (*cough* Cradle of Filth). They don't have the best drummer in black metal, but I guess it's pretty hard to beat Nicholas Barker, and Flavias is pretty good. I'm not wild about black metal, but this is one that really stands out. This album delivers a kick in the stomach that you just won't get elsewhere.

...you better believe I would! This has to be the most daring and innovative band on Napalm Records, which is really saying a lot, since that same label carries Atrocity, Vintersorg, Sirenia, and other fantastic artists. But Korpiklaani is likely to be some of the most captivating, yet very fun metal you'll ever hear. If you were put off by the overdose of black metal influence found on Finntroll's albums, then Korpiklaani is the antidote. First of all, they sing in English, so you can understand them. Their earlier works, under the band name Shaman, were in Finnish, but their first attempt in English is much better. Not that Jonne is any particularly wonderful lyricist, but hey, it's all based off of Finnish folklore, so in the end, it's all good. This album features searing guitar work, inspired by gothic and old-school metal and maybe even a tad of folk-noir, but the real highlight comes from Hittavainen, the violinist/flutist. It's not like Tristania or My Dying Bride, where you get a little melancholic violin sample now and then; Hittavainen is right up front there, playing alongside the guitars and often taking center stage. His work sounds exactly like what you'd expect to hear sitting around a campfire in the Finnish wilderness. As a friend of mine so kindly pointed out, Jonne (vocals/lead guitar) has the voice of a storyteller who's trying to scare little kids. It may sound contrary to the music at first, but his voice really grows on you after a while.One thing that might put many listeners off is the fact that many of the songs are rather short. There are a few long ones, like the absolutely exceptional "With Trees," but most of them never even exceed four minutes (some don't even reach three). There are six songs that are totally instrumental, with the best (and longest) being the closer, "Mother Earth." It sounds nothing like the sappy Within Temptation song by the same name, by the way. This one actually possesses fine musicianship. It reminds me a bit of a Native American tune, although it's really Native Finnish, hehe. Other highlights for me are "Pellonpekko" (an instrumental adaptation of a Finnish folk tune; there are several like it but this is the best), "Wooden Pints," and "Before the Morning Sun." There are no poor songs, although Jonne's vocals in "You Looked Into My Eyes" aren't very good (the song itself is, though). This is an excellent addition to any metal collection. If you like this type of 'nature metal,' I'd also recommend Agalloch and Nest; neither band sounds anything like Korpiklaani (Nest isn't even metal), but are great for forest souls. A must-have; Finland's best band easily!

This is a good depiction of what Emperor had done over the course of their career, but there's a lot of disparity in production quality, particularly on the second disc, making for a rather choppy listening experience. Disc 1 has a lot of good stuff and was worth the price alone for. However, it still has issues. There are two live tracks (Thus Spake the Nightspirit and Ye Entrancemperium) that would've probably sounded better at the end than in the middle, or simply in their studio versions. There are a few high-quality tracks on disc 2 (particularly the covers and Opus A Satana) but for the most part, it sounds like they recorded it in a garage. Hell I've heard garage bands with far superior sound quality. And that poor quality detracts heavily from the final product. In truth, this is for longtime Emperor fans and not newbies. To start, get Nightside and Anthems and maybe IX Equilibrium, and make this one of the last additions to your collection.

I admit I liked "Da Unbreakables" at first, but it got old real fast. Maybe its because I don't listen to rap (except older Three 6) anymore and metal has much more lasting enjoyment than (c)rap, but still, two months after I bought it, I'm tired of it. There are a few good songs, but for the most part, it's just the regular "gangsta dis, gangsta dat, yo" that makes nearly all hip-hop a total waste of CD space. Three 6 used to be a group that had character, but now, even Lord Infamous can't deliver the enjoyable brutal performance that made me a Three 6 fan in the first place. It's too radio-friendly; Ridin' Spinners is a dumb song and so is anything with Lil Flip, especially that atrocity of a "song" Rainbow Colors. People, save your money and buy The End if you want a decent rap album. Paul and Juice are done; they might as well just retire because it's evident that they don't put any pride into their work anymore (not that they ever did, but at one time they at least stood out from the MTV/BET garbage crowd).

Agathodaimon falls into the melodic black metal realm, sort of like early Cradle of Filth and Siebenburgen. They have a very good drummer and the guitar work (which includes some great acoustic pieces) is fantastic. The vocals are the typical you'd hear on a BM album, sounding a lot like Satyr from Satyricon. They also have a guy with a synthesized robotic voice doing some voiceovers, and there are some clean vocals scattered throughout the album. Best songs in my opinion are &quot;An Angel's Funeral,&quot; &quot;Departure,&quot; and the ballad-ish &quot;Sacred Divinity&quot; (which does have some great heavy parts). It's something you should get if you're a black metal fan open to other genres. If you're the type who listens to nothing but Burzum (great band) and DarkThrone, then you might not like it. If you're more of a Cradle or Dimmu fan, and want something a little less cheesy and more aggressive, then Agathodaimon's Chapter III is for you. The only thing I don't like is that they don't give you a list of what each member plays.

I'm used to debut albums that either lack in production or musicianship. The only thing lacking here is Sabine's vocals, which, like Cristina Scabbia on Lacuna Coil's debut, are in the 'under construction' stage. This was corrected on their next album.You get a lot of bang for your buck with this album. There are nine tracks, but the last one is almost eleven minutes and the title track is eight and a half. They aren't afraid to play their songs out, and even when they do, the songs don't get boring. Honestly, if I could petition the band for one thing, it'd be an instrumental, just to prove to the world that, unlike most female-fronted metal bands, these guys can actually play their instruments and don't need the vocals to cover up any mediocrity. The most noticeable difference between this and later albums is that there is only one guitar on this effort, whereas a second guitarist was added for their next offering. The lyrics are somewhat profound; I don't know what to make of them just yet, mainly because I haven't had it long enough to sit down and read them, but that's a minor issue anyway. Get this album now.

In all honesty, I'm a huge fan of Burzum's metal work, but the Count's ambient synth music is simply incredible as well. It makes perfect atmospheric music; not something I listen to as stand-alone entertainment, but it's great for atmosphere and helps me during times of deep thought, creative writing, and even composing my own music (even though I'm writing dark-metal). The story line to this album is interesting even though I'm not an Odinist, and the music is perfect to bring images into the listener's mind while envisioning the tale that Grishnackh tells through his keyboards. Highly recommended to anyone who can get past Varg's &quot;image&quot; and concentrate on the important part - his musical genius.

If you're looking for realistic metal, look elsewhere. Battlelore is a very creative band who has better things to talk about than misery and depression. They take the works of the literary master J.R.R. Tolkien, transform them into majestic and well-thought lyrics, and put them to some of the best metal you're likely to find. Battlelore's first album is far superior to their second release (which is a fantastic release itself, but I think they were spending too much time making the upcoming DVD and that had most of their attention). Just take &quot;Shadowgate&quot; and &quot;Fangorn&quot; for example. Lots of influences from gothic, industrial, and symphonic black metal, combined with fantastic female vocals courtesy of the lovely and spirited Kaisa Jouhki, excellent clean male vocals by Patrik Mennander, and raging vocals done without any voice distortion! Jyri Vahvanen's compositions are very precise, and while Henri's drumming sometimes goes against the music a little, the overall result is fantastic. There isn't a weak song on the album. If you're a Tolkien fan and weren't particularly thrilled with Blind Guardian's Tolkien-inspired works (even though BG is a great band as well), then give Battlelore a try. The guitars aren't as fast and whiny, but to me, that's a good thing, as BL is far more atmospheric and enchanting. In addition, they are a very fan-friendly band, and their stage-outfits are great!

The first thing fans of 'old' In Flames will say is &quot;this sounds like nu-metal.&quot; No, it doesn't. Just because the songs are shorter and made more accessible to mass audiences doesn't make them a nu-metal band. If that were the case, then Lacuna Coil, Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom, and Dark Tranquillity are all nu-metal bands, too.The idea behind this is to make a more technical (in conceptual theory, not necessarily musical) and at the same time, establish In Flames with a wider fan base. There's nothing wrong with wanting to sell more records, provided that you're still making music from the heart and not the wallet. Now granted, there are things about this album (and most recent In Flames, for that matter), but I'm not going to say it's horrid. First of all, I do miss the acoustic guitar and I wish they'd do acoustic interludes again. Also, despite the fact that I can't stand bands that use only extreme vocals, I wish Anders would sing less and growl more. Anders isn't exactly a world-class singer, you know. Aside from that, the guitars on here I think are actually pretty good, despite not being as precise and complex as they were on the band's early works. So in the end, it's only nu-metal if you go into it with a closed mind and have already pulled the veil of ignorance over your ears.

Gangsta Boo was one of the only female rappers that could carry a good album... what am I saying, she WAS the only one that could make a listenable album. She's hot too. Anyway, it isn't the greatest, as the lyrics get repetitive, but she doesn't take it all that seriously like some rappers. I guess she figured "it's just for fun, I'll make money, who cares what I'm saying." The beats make it good.

A Bridge Too Far is a long movie, so unless you're truly a WWII film enthusiast, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you're looking for some insight into one of the lesser-known operations of that bloody conflict, then this movie is great.Operation Market Garden was an ambitious plan by the brilliant but often arrogant strategist Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, and unfortunately, it cost the lives of many brave soldiers. Although Monty considered the operation a success, it failed to achieve one of its main objectives (the siege of the bridge at Arnhem in Holland), and the casualty rate was unacceptably high. Many of those killed were members of the British 1st Airborne, who were literally fighting tanks with rifles. Col. Frost (played in this film by Anthony Hopkins) and his men fought bravely, but there was no way in Hell that lightly-armed paratroops were going to defeat an SS Panzer division. It also illustrates the slaughter of Polish troops (the Polish general is played by Gene Hackman), who were delayed in landing because of fog, picked off by enemy troops as they parachuted down, and then ambushed by the Germans in a nighttime river assault trying to come to the aid of General Urquhart (Sean Connery), forcing the General to withdraw.The film is laden with big-name actors, and while it doesn't feature any jazzy modern-day special effects, it focuses on the main issue: the sacrifice of the men who fought in this overly ambitious campaign. The film profiles the mistakes made leading up to the campaign, such as the lack of planning, overlooking of certain obstacles (example: a photo-reconnaissance mission over Holland revealed German tanks, but the Allied high command was so eager to push the campaign forward that they simply ignored them), and the fact that the operation was rushed. The acting is great, but with the cast list that this film has, you wouldn't expect anything less. The film is split up such that no one actor gets the bulk of the attention. It's a great film for history buffs, and reveals the brutal and haunting truth about an operation that Allied forces would like to forget.

There's no doubt Bizzy has a lot to talk about, and he presents the material in a way that audiences both ghetto and suburban can envision. On this album, which unfortunately can't boast great production, Bizzy lets off a lot of lyrical steam about his early life, his current trials and tribulations, and the shaky relations he was having with the rest of BTNH. However, he overdoes the singing in many places, really sounding like a little choir girl at times which can get really annoying. When he raps, he's raw as ever. &quot;Don't Doubt Me&quot; and &quot;Before I Go&quot; are good examples, and are some of his best solo efforts ever. Unfortunately, I think Bizzy is done; his performance on Thug World Order was less-than-par, and he's split from Bone now, so one can only hope that he can rebound.

With Sirenia's debut, Morten Veland proves that he's still a powerful force on the Norwegian gothic metal scene, and while Tristania's new album is quite enjoyable, this puts it to shame easily. To be honest, it doesn't sound like old Tristania, particularly in the pitch of the guitars. Sirenia uses more synthesizer than Veland-era Tristania, but not as much as the new material from the latter band. Also, the bass guitar seems more powerful. Percussion-wise, old Tristania featured a richer texture, and although there are some good moments, it can't match the level that we heard on Beyond The Veil. There is more interplay between the vocalists in most of the songs, alternating between Kristian Gunderson's airy, enchanting clean vocals, Morten's rich growls and passionate screams, and the flawless ethereal female vocals of Fabienne Gondamin. It's nice to have a break from the onslaught of operatic sopranos, and the more 'traditional' voice of Gondamin fits the 'Sirenian' theme perfectly, just as Vibeke of Tristania had the voice to fit the archaic goth/classical themes of that band before they O.D.'ed on electronics. Elusive's Jan Kenneth Barkved, who also does guest work for Tristania, does backing vocals on a few songs. He has the more operatic male vocals, but always sings in harmony with Kristian.For lovers of Beyond The Veil and Widow's Weeds, there will be plenty to make you happy, but there will also be a few letdowns. First of all, there is very little choir use. There are only four choir members (two male and two female), and they almost always sing together. There is none of that beautiful Benedictine-style male chanting that I so loved on BTV. Also, Pete Johansen's violin playing isn't as prominent as it is on the new Tristania. Lyrically, it seems like Morten is taking a more fatalist approach to life, and while the lyrics aren't as depressing as the ones you'll find on Tristania's World of Glass (sorry, but it's impossible not to compare the two), they don't have quite the character that his poetry during his stint with Tristania had. It could've just been a bad time for him. He writes a lot about lost faith and what he perceives to be an empty void in life.The track list is as follows:1. Meridian (5/5) - In typical Veland style, the album opens strongly. This is the only song that Morten dominates vocally and is one of only two or three with a choir. The only thing I don't like is that there are some dumb synth effects thrown in.2. Sister Nightfall (5/5) - This is where you begin to notice the increase in synthesizer use, and is also where the vocal interchanges come into play. Both clean male vocalists are featured.3. On The Wane (5+/5) - Aside from the chorus, which features the worst lyrics Morten has ever written, this is probably the best song on the album. Features the best choir part on the album and a sinister intro.4. In a Manica (5/5) - Another really good song. The verses sound a little corny but Morten saves it. Very strong presence of keyboards and synths but they are used effectively.5. At Sixes and Sevens (4/5) - The longest song on the album, this one's just a little too slow for my taste. It's listenable, but I tend to skip over it.6. Lethargica (5+/5) - Vocally, this is the best song on the album. The intro sounds remarkably similar to that of "Sister Nightfall" but more atmospheric. Only downside is that mid-way through, there is a corny-sounding male choir part.7. Manic Aeon (5/5) - This song starts off very soft, and Fabienne's verses are probably what got the band its name. It features the best drumming on the album.8. A Shadow of Your Own Self (4.5/5) - Nothing new or unusual about this one; your typical above-average material.9. In Sumerian Haze (4/5) - This song stays soft the whole way through. It's a great showcase of vocal goddess Fabienne's talent, as she's the only one to sing, but there are no guitars. The violin playing is good, though.The verdict: If you're a fan of gothic metal, such as Tristania, old Theatre of Tragedy, TSOTB, or even lighter stuff like Edenbridge, Nightwish, and Lacuna Coil, this is worth a gander. Even fans of heavier black and death metal, such as Old Man's Child and Dark Tranquillity, find themselves liking this album. It's certainly not all pretty; if you're one of those cranky goth fans who get offended by the death & black metal vocals, then stay away, because they're still there. However, if you appreciate the talent that it takes to produce such a vocal arrangement (I'm pretty sure Morten does it without using voice distortion) and actually like the sound of extreme vocals over a piece of melodic metal, as I do, then this is for you. Buy today, and on February 23, be sure to get the new album An Elixir For Existence, which will feature a new, permanent female singer, Henriette Bordvik. Fabienne was only a session vocalist and is from France, and while I'll miss her divine voice, I've heard the sample song for the new album and Henriette is a worthy replacement. Until then, long live Morten Veland and long live Sirenia! I can only imagine what's going through the minds of Einar Moen and Anders Hidle (the two that kicked Morten out of Tristania) right now...

From what I've heard, metal is a big taboo in the Middle East. It goes against their anything-but-secular system of submission... er, government. But here we have a band that takes their distaste with all of the religious hypocrisy and 'holy wars' in the region and makes a positive album related to it. The music is not preaching, as the satanic black metal guy said it was (closed mindedness is bad), but is not an attack on faith as most inept metal is. This is intellectual metal, addressing a very real issue in a constructive manner. The album features some traditional instruments, which are very good, and has well-composed songs with exquisite musicianship. The vocals are diverse and strong, and add a lot to the music. There is a bonus disc with some (maybe all) copies with an exceptional acoustic show they did before the release of this album. I'd buy it again just for that. Certainly a worthy addition to any thinking man's (or woman's) metal collection.

After hearing K-Rock's performance in his Prophet Posse (the real Prophet Posse) years, I was expecting more. His style has degraded lower than Indo G's, and that's pretty bad. The guest appearances on here didn't help to save it any. His gum-flapping "brbrbrbrbr" or whatever he does gets real annoying. My expectations were WAY too high (I bought this and "K-Rock The World" simultaneously). I was expecting performances similar to what he did on the Three 6 Mafia album "The End," and what I got was the biggest waste of money ever. If you're contemplating buying this, I suggest you think twice.

This is probably Triple Six's best underground collection release. Even though it isn't high-quality production (it was done on cheap home equipment), it's lots of entertainment. "Lick My Nutts" and "Long And Hard" are hilarious, as is "Slob On My Knob Pt. II" - ladies, don't expect any sensitive love songs here. D.J. Paul, Juicy J, and Lord Infamous make it quite clear that they aren't the "lovey-dovey" types... and they do it in a way that, unless you're a saint, will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Three 6 Mafia has always managed to make the bland genre of rap enjoyable and entertaining, and they're one artist I don't mind supporting.

I am not a satanist. Nor am I a heathen or atheist or nihilist or anything else associated with the 'black metal lifestyle.' But I love Immortal's Sons of Northern Darkness album. It features surprisingly good production for a subgenre of metal that, for some reason I still cannot figure out, forces upon itself sloppy and scratchy production so it can sound 'evil' (or, if you're living in the real world where face paint and fake medieval weapons don't scare you, 'just plain dumb'). Immortal still does the whole 'corpse paint' (aka clown paint) thing, but for some reason, with these guys, I don't laugh quite as hard because they're really good musicians. Abbath's guitars are some of the best I've heard in the genre, and as said before, Horgh is an extremely capable drummer. Sure, he's not on Hellhammer's level, but close.Immortal didn't fill this CD with a bunch of mindless satanic garbage; it's 'evil'-sounding enough without it. So if you're not a goat-worshipping buffoon, then this is a black metal CD that will probably appeal to you. Get it now because it rocks.

Dismal Euphony did nothing new with this. Who'd ever thought of making music about being a psychopath before? That's only been done a million times over. Anyway, I heard "Days of Sodom" on one of Nuclear Blast's Beauty in Darkness compilations and thought it was terrible, but then heard the title track on Death is Just The Beginning V, and it caught my attention, particularly because of the female vocals which are not flat like most bands. That's where the good ends. First clue that it's going to be a drag is in the liner notes; generally, anything produced by Waldemar Sorychta (including Lacuna Coil) has a tendency to be boring and uninspired, aimed at a mainstream audience, and more concerned with image and being 'big, bad, and satanic' than with actually making good music. The black-vocals are awful; it sounds like he's coughing into a microphone with the reverb maxed out. The guitar style sounds like Draconian's, or to be more elaborate, a pathetic failed attempt to duplicate the Swedish melodic death metal sound. The music is dominated by the keyboards and the drumming is totally out of place. Buy this if you need a break from your death/black metal collection, but there are definitely far superior bands/albums out there.

If Elis is to be compared to anyone, they're more like a heavier version of Lacuna Coil or Within Temptation. Sabine Dunser proves the theory that good looks don't equate to good singing, as she sounds like a robot half the time and cannot be placed in the same category as goddess Tarja. The drumming is too heavy for the music, which is mostly done on a synthesizer (which is played by Alexander Krull; he proves to be a better musician than anyone in Elis). Overall, if you heard the sample song ("For Such A Long Time") on the Napalm Records sampler, and thought it was just so-so, like I did, then be cautious about buying because that's the best song on here aside from "Child," which features Atrocity's drummer. I doubt many Nightwish fans will like Elis. They aren't bad, but they're not anything world-class.

When I first got started into the realm of Tristania, I was immediately caught by World of Glass, and Beyond The Veil took some getting used to. But after playing it through thorougly several times (and annoying the hell out of my roommate - hey, that's what he gets for making me endure The Calling and the damn Moody Blues for so long!), I see more and more good qualities about Beyond The Veil that just aren't present in World of Glass, and it has become (along with Lacuna Coil's Comalies) the most valued item in my music collection. Why? Listen for yourself, the album is darn near flawless. This is complex, heavy, dark, beautiful, poetic, and inspired music, much to the contrary of anything you'd find on the American mainstream. Our RIAA would frown upon such talented artists, which is why it is impossible to find Tristania in any American music stores.Morten Veland is an amazing songwriter in both the lyrical and instrumental regimes. His lyrics may not be quite as introspective as Einar's or Osten's, but they're more poetic and less cliche. He's up there with Dani Filth as one of the more creative lyricists in metal, but unlike Filth, there are no satanic references in Tristania's music, it's just pure gothic poetry. And you can call it "gothic" due to the archaic themes of their songs. You don't have to be a goth to make gothic music; in fact, true gothic metal bands are not composed of goths. So stop calling Manson and Evanescence gothic. Anyway, back to the album, the guitars are so much better than they would be later on World of Glass, since Anders seems to be more of a rhythm guitarist and typically doesn't play a whole lot of riffs, whereas Morten makes a good lead. Morten's powerful extreme vocals are worlds better than Trail of Tears' Ronny Thorsen, who was his "replacement" on WOG. Osten Bergoy's clean singing seems to stand out much more here, as he sounds more like a professional vocalist on here than the cartoon character he sounded like on WOG. The choir parts are woven into the music far better, enhancing the atmosphere a great deal instead of overpowering the music. And then there's the lovely Vibeke Stene. She doesn't take as much prominence here, but to some degree, that's a good thing, because instead of sounding like mellow music with gruff vocals like most of WOG did, Stene's parts come out more as the light shining through the darkness. Flawless.Tristania is in a class of their own, and I get tired of seeing them compared to mediocre acts like Theatre of Tragedy. The only rival they have right now is Sirenia (Veland's new band), so cut the "they sound like Therion" or "they're TOT + Cradle of Filth" or whatever. That's the problem with music fans today: they don't embrace the idea of originality. Hell, any established female-fronted band (i.e., Lacuna Coil), no matter how long they've been around, is automatically an Evanescence clone in the eyes of today's industry sheep - I mean - music fans. Tristania is a clone of nobody. They are possibly the most original band in the music industry, maybe even more so than Opeth. Not many bands use a mix of slow, heavy metal mixed with operatic female vocals, live violins (the best part), classical male singing, powerful drumming, and death/black vocals in a constantly-changing and unpredictable musical environment such as this. So don't try to compare them with anyone, the massive talent of these guys (and girl) will blow you away. I dare thee... enter the realm of Tristania! Once you're in, you won't want to leave!

If you're a metal fan and haven't heard this, you're missing out on an important milestone in the genre. Songs like "Fade To Black" (one of the band's finest works ever) and "For Whom The Bell Tolls" will go down as metal classics. The instrumental "Call of Ktulu" illustrates this superior band's ability to produce quality music without the aid of vocals. Even though it's only four and a half minutes long, "Escape" is one of my personal favorites. Honestly, there is not a single weak track on Ride The Lightning. This is one album nobody should be without.

I really got started into Metallica with their newer stuff ("Load" and "Reload"), both of which are decent, but when I heard this, I was hooked. It's tied with "Ride The Lightning" as my (close) second favorite Metallica album (after the black album). I have to say, every song except "Disposable Heroes" is top-notch. The aforementioned track is great instrumentalism, but is just too fast for my tastes. The rest is a little slower, which (in my opinion) displays the heaviness of the riffs and percussion to the fullest. "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" is one of those songs that starts off kinda soft and gets heavier as it goes on, demonstrating the incredible versatility of this band. "Orion" is void of any vocals, allowing one to totally focus on the brilliant instrumentalism. All in all, this album is one hell of a triumph of Metallica. After hearing albums like this and Lightning, I begin to understand why so many people are so disappointed with their newer stuff ... My advice, in short: get ..."Master of Puppets" today! If you already have it, you know good musicianship.

Yeah, and A.C. writes sensitive love songs. This is awful. Poor production, even worse musicianship, and nothing at all original. The singer sounds neutered, the violin sounds like a little girl being choked, and the flute... I never thought a flute could sound so bad. This is just another doom metal band proving my theory that 'atmospheric' is just a pseudonym for 'sloppy' to most of these bands. Come on, nine minutes to play a riff and two chords? Give me a break. The piano parts are painfully simple, the grunts are completely out of place... basically, this has all been done before, and even though the 'funereal dirge' really needs to die out as much as hip-hop does, there are actually some bands who can pull it off without sounding like a bunch of 90-year-old grannies trying to play death metal. Don't ever insult My Dying Bride by comparing them to this lackluster band again.Another thing I love about bands like this... all their satanic/anti-christian lyrics and images, while half of the band is wearing Christian crosses on their necklaces! Trendies...

This was one of the many albums that, when first purchasing, I didn't have high expectations for, after hearing Krayzie's solos on "The Art of War" and the Mo Thugs albums. But this is a pure masterpiece. Out of 38 tracks, about 30 are excellent. Even the intro is a classic - I love the beat in the background. My personal favorite is "World War," but "Thug Alwayz," "Thug Mentality," "Street People," "Silent Warrior," "Armageddon," "Murda Mo," "Won't Ez Up Tonight," "Sad Song," "Heated Heavy," and "Paper" are all the type that can be listened to all the way through. Even though I'm not a drug user, I can play "Smokin Buddah" all the way through. Krayzie has a very good voice for singing, more so than any rapper aside of Koopsta Knicca, who lost his back in 1997. This is an awesome double CD, and it's something every Bone fan should have.

Bands like Nightwish and Within Temptation have been getting a lot of attention lately for being 'great female-fronted metal bands,' but in all honesty, neither of those two bands have produced anything that can be categorized as better than mediocre in the last few years. So, it's up to lesser-knowns like Alas to make good female-fronted metal. This isn't gothic at all; there's strong reference to bandleader Erik Rutan's true passion of death metal, with the speedy, precise guitar work. It's a boundary-crosser; some death, some doom, some atmospheric/melodic metal, and more. No orchestra required. I'm getting so fed up with bands hiring huge orchestras and choirs to cover up their lack of musical innovation and to make a statement of 'uniqueness.' Alas does it all with just four musicians, and those four musicians do more for this album than everyone in Nightwish, plus all their guest musicians, choir singers, and orchestra players did for that band's new offering.Now, I don't particularly care for brutal death metal. In fact, I think the only bands I can stand are Nile and Morbid Angel, the latter of which Mr. Rutan did play in. I do, however, like melodic death, like Opeth and the Gothenburg crowd. Any of the death metal elements of this album seem to follow the melodic death style, because while the guitar work is far better than what you'd expect to hear from a band with a girl out front, it is very melodic and fluent. Not brutal, not really technical, and not distorted to hell and back. The female singer Martina Astner is quite good, but the really nice thing is that she is never put front-and-center. What I mean is, she is never used to cover up a sloppy instrumental. Instead of having a loud, rampaging female voice clawing your eardrums out while the music is just there to provide an ambience, what you get from Alas is a fantastic piece of music with the vocals woven into it so as to use the voice as simply another instrument in the main composition. The keyboards, also played by Rutan, are used far less intrusively than Nightwish, Within Temptation, or the like. This band is primarily a metal band, with some synth there for a sense of melody, but the keyboards are never the dominant instrument. The bass and drumming are quite commendable as well. There are no classical instruments used; I have nothing against using classical instruments, in fact I like it in most cases, but sadly, violins are becoming a cliche in metal and bands are using them in all the wrong ways. So in this offering, we get only guitar, keys, bass, drums, and a voice.This is an American band, sans Martina. Now, many ignoramuses may write them off, citing the lack of talent in the majority of mainstream American bands, but remember that there are some very good artists to come out of these States. It's just that, like Alas, the good ones like Agalloch, Novembers Doom, Sculptured, Nothing, and Subterranean Masquerade all go relatively unnoticed. So, if you're tired of the same old 'symphonic' metal and want a female-fronted metal band with innovation and versatility, then get Alas' Absolute Purity today. Also recommended are: Leaves' Eyes, Sirenia, Trail of Tears, How Like A Winter, Evenfall, Elis.

The solo albums show evidence that they were spur-of-the-moment things, as they seem relatively disorderly. It was like they walked into the studio, started making beats, and had the HCP crew start rapping. The Linkin Park samples are okay; Lord's verse on the posse song is the best part of the album. Not bad, but not great either.

First of all, if the song titles offend you, go back to your cheesy gospel music.I don't like grindcore. I think it is ridiculous and uses the excuse of 'we play fast and heavy' to cover up the fact that they don't know the first thing about musicianship. But A.C. is great; their chaotic playing fits their hilarious lyrical content perfectly. I'd give these guys medals for offending people. People are too soft-hearted and libertarian these days, and need to be offended. So the weak can cry me a river; the rest of us can laugh our anuses off listening to this pure chaotic tapestry.

I would say that I have a hard time choosing between this and Empiricism as Borknagar's finest. E would probably win because it is longer and has Vintersorg's vocals, which are better than those of I.C.S. Vortex, but this album nonetheless is a fantastic release from Oystein G. Brun's band of heathen metallers. Great compositions and atmosphere, without using the 'atmospheric' label to justify sloppy musicianship. This is some of the most well-played music in all of black metal. Highly recommended.

Theatre of Tragedy's self-titled is their best work aside from Aegis, in my humble opinion. Anything after Aegis is pure trash, as we all know, and Velvet Darkness They Fear is pretty bland after a few listens. But the band's debut is pretty darn good. The use of cello on a few songs, combined with excellent piano pieces, really adds to the flavor. Theatre of Tragedy never did anything spectacular with their guitars, except distort or downtune the hell out of them to make them sound 'heavy,' but hey it all works out. "Sweet Art Thou" has one of the best intros I've ever heard, and at only 3:58, it should've been a precedent on where TOT and other 'doom' metal bands ended their songs. I hate these nine-minute draggers that have one chord and one riff, and cheesy synth effects (I'm referring to bands like Ashes You Leave and TSOTB, not TOT), so at least Raymond and company knew when to end a song. The growls are good as usual, although a little too heavily distorted. Liv's voice is okay, nothing special. Lyrically it's pretty good, especially if you like Shakespearean poetry. I highly recommend this and Aegis if you want to hear good Theatre of Tragedy. I still think Tristania (at least in the Veland era) is a million times better... sorry TOT worshippers.

There's no denying Meshuggah's stamina. They produce a form of metal that would sound like meaningless noise that lacks any sort of direction to the untrained listener, but for those of us who like heavy music and can see past the cliches set forth by ignorant critics, there is a truly intricate piece of musicianship to be found in Chaosphere. The band couldn't have picked a better title for this wild album. I prefer the slowed-down and more primitive sound found on Nothing a little better, but this is not to say that Chaosphere has any real defects. To keep it short and sweet, this is heavy metal like it should be done. Nothing melodic about this, but even if you're a fan of such bands as In Flames, you'll probably like the break into pure chaos that Meshuggah delivers. Now that I've heard this and Nothing, it's time to get a hold of some cash and get the rest of their albums.

I spent a lot of years hating Tupac because of his image and frenzied followers, but that's really no reason to hate an artist. Yeah, I bashed the hell out of him in the past but in truthfulness, he wasn't all bad. The reason I only gave this double-CD three stars was because a) there isn't enough material on the discs and b) there are a lot of good songs that were left off. If it were just a regular compilation, it probably could've gotten more, but since they're billing it as his Greatest Hits, there are a buttload of other songs that should've been on it.I wish to hell today's rap would be a little more like this. I didn't really respect the guy's lifestyle, but at least his music had a point, and it wasn't just meaningless babble like the MTV rappers. He had the ability to tell stories with his music, and while I wouldn't quite call it poetry, it was worlds more meaningful than the slop that BET and MTV throw at us.

Overall, this is (was) a good profile of Hypnotize Minds' top-notch roster. It definitely has its high points, but it's got too many low points for me to give it a 5. First of all, the track with Pastor Troy could've used a lot more bass. It's a tight song, but just seems to be missing something. La Chat's solo song seems like an endless repetition of the same thing for the whole 3 minutes (thankfully it's a short song). But that's the bad side. Both posse songs are above average, and both of Gangsta Boo's songs are attention-keepers. &quot;Who Run It&quot; is a nice song to play in the car, really annoys all the old timers when ya drive through their retirement community blasting it (of course I never do that...cough)! The star of the album has to be T-Rock - I'm still mad they dropped him from Hypnotize!

Beautiful gothic music... this??? Don't make me laugh. Where are the guitars? You only get a few seconds worth of guitar in any given song. The rest is just boring, repetitive mellow music that would put you to sleep if not for Heather's painfully horrible vocals. I just can't understand why a great label like Nuclear Blast would sign such a lackluster artist to their artist roster. It's not gothic, it's not metal, and it sure as hell is not beautiful. And why all the freaking programming? Use guitars, people! They were created so that humans could create music that has more complexity than what rapper apes can produce. In short, this is a Mariah Carey album with sporadic electric guitars.

The beauty of Opeth lies in the band's ability to conquer many different styles of music. This album, while it lacks the variety of their older releases, maintains a constant flow of mellow songs that prove to listeners that Opeth can master these as well as they can master the heavier material. The first track, "Windowpane," is the best (in my humble opinion) and is one of my favorite Opeth songs to date. "To Rid The Disease" is another good song. In all honesty, they're all good songs, but those two stand out to me. If you're looking for anything heavy, then this is not the album for you, as the vocals are all clean and the heaviest parts are about as heavy as what you'd find on a Genesis album. But if you need a nice long break from the maelstrom of metal, then this album is definitely for you. Nothing extreme, but nevertheless, Damnation is pure musical mastery.

This was my first In Flames album, and it remains second only to The Jester Race as my favorite album by this talented Swedish band. I don't think there's a single bad track on it, but &quot;Ordinary Story&quot; is the one that gets most of my attention. It has very poignant lyrics, which are delivered flawlessly over some great guitar work.I'll be riding in my truck with other people and be playing In Flames. These folks are typically unaware of the band's existence; typically, they're nu-metal or 1991-onward Metallica buffs, and they ask me, &quot;what the hell do you see in these guys? This all sounds like noise.&quot; For those types, In Flames is an inexplicable musical experience. Even for myself, they were more of an acquired taste. But listening to albums like this makes one realize that nu-metal is repetitive and bland, and melodic music like that of In Flames is where true talent lies. The sound isn't for everyone, as the Gothenborg sound can be overwhelming to 'easy listening' (like Metallica's ReLoad) fans. But if you can see the excellence that lies beneath the gruff sound of the guitars, the overpowering precision of the drums, and the raspy vocals, then you're going to love Colony.

Beseech seems to be a blend of synth-pop and gothic metal, which I would never expect to work but they seem to do it. Put aside the fact that their lead singer looks like a poster child for the Pink Flamingo alternate lifestyle entertainment center, they are pretty good in the area of synth and atmosphere, but musically they're a typical goth-rock act. Nothing much to say about the guitar/drum/bass section, except that it's pretty straightforward and they don't do much out of the ordinary. The male singer sounded good the first time I heard him, but his voice gets annoying after a while. The girl isn't too bad. Overall an album worth getting if you're into stuff like Lacuna Coil or Type O Negative.

Jon Schaffer finally breaks out and combines his love for history with his talent for making metal music. If you haven't already figured, each song is based around a major historical event, most of them being war-related. The trilogy "Gettysburg (1863)" is worth the price of the CD in itself, with the total time for all three tracks coming in at around 32 minutes. If you get this version, you get the trilogy on a separate disc and 11 great songs on the first. I still don't like Tim Owens as a vocalist, and think Matt would've sounded better, but even his whiny scream can't bring down what Schaffer has put together. The only song that suffers a lot is "When The Eagle Cries," which simply proves that Owens doesn't have a voice for ballads. It's a song about the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and the band made a video for it. I haven't yet picked a highlight track, as I'm writing this only a few hours after purchase, but it's probably either "Attila" or "Hollow Man" (more of a ballad-type song but with better vocal integration). There are no bad songs, though. The Star-Spangled Banner never sounded so... metal... as it does when Jon plays it on an electric guitar!Iced Earth and metal fans - buy this CD today! Get the double-CD version, because the extra tracks you get ("Greenface" and "When The Eagle Cries (Unplugged)") are worth a spot in your playlist. If there was any uncertainty about how the band would function without Matt (who did help write two of the songs before his departure), this album will squash it.

Well Tchort, you're no longer just a sick dude who used to play in one of those black metal bands (yeah, I called Emperor 'just one of those black metal bands')! You're now a fantastic composer and a brilliant musician.Light of Day, Day of Darkness... what can I say that hasn't been said already? Well, if there was one thing I didn't like, and mind you, there is ONE thing I don't like about it, it's the female vocalist, Synne Soprana. Very bad girl! She doesn't really do any kind of lead vocals, but they're not ambience vocals either. She just makes noises for part of it. But aside from that, and keep in mind some folks may adore her style so this is just a matter of opinion, this is musical magnificence. I mean, a saxophone in a metal band? Only here could that work out so perfectly. There are elements of just about every kind of music you could think of, save for pop, rap, and country. Honestly, I don't know how to describe to you just how amazing this song (it feels so weird saying 'song' instead of 'album' or 'CD'!) really is. You've got to hear it for yourself. This is possibly the most marvelous piece of contemporary music ever written; if Beethoven or Mozart or Rachmaninoff or Berlioz or any of the other greats were still alive today, I think they'd be giving Mr. Tchort one hell of a pat on the back!

There's nothing more annoying than reviewers whose sole purpose is to go all-out and bash an artist simply because they feel that said artist is a threat to their favorite band's dominance.Edenbridge is not a Nightwish clone by any means. Sabine is not trying to emulate Tarja in any way, and if she was, I'd say she's a damned fool. Listen to your Nightwish CDs a couple more times. Sure, Tarja has a good OPERA voice - NOT a METAL voice. If she's on key and in tune with the music, it's beautiful, but until Century Child, that was only 35-40% of the time! So, I will only offer this as a medium of comparison: Sabine Edelsbacher is a modest, yet highly capable vocalist, who is always on key and always blends her fantastic vocals into the music. It's really sad when bands like this and Sirenia (for their lack of 'operatic' vocals), and even the ever-so-popular Evanescence, who are all very talented artists with great vocalists, get bashed by closed-minded fanatical fans who can't seem to pull their heads from between the legs of Tarja Turunen or Floor Jansen or Anneke van Giersbergen, none of whom have ever impressed me.Anyway, here's how it goes. Edenbridge isn't afraid to step outside of the box, and throw in elements that are taboo in the world of power metal. For one, they don't overdo the constant percussion. Roland Navratil knows how to hit the kit, and he doesn't have to use a synthesized drum pattern to provide a rhythm sector. I swear, that really makes power metal unlistenable, in the same vein as listening to Emperor, where all you can hear is Trym beating the drums out of shape. Edenbridge doesn't do that in every song. Actually, there are only a few that do have it. There are two guitars on Arcana, whereas there was only one on Sunrise in Eden, and the second makes a world of difference. There are some cheesy keyboard parts, but most of the time, the synthesizers are used very effectively and do not cover up the guitar work. Actually, unlike a lot of female-fronted bands, the guitars stand out a lot, since the vocals don't overpower the music. Remember, this is metal, and metal is all about the music. If you're just interested in vocals, listen to pop. Lanvall is a pretty good composer, and he actually plays acoustic guitars! I don't think I've ever heard an acoustic guitar in a power metal band. Yeah, these guys (and girl) aren't 100% power metal, but it's the closest match. Anyway, the acoustics are very good, and the band does ballads just as well as they do heavier songs.Lyrically, it is a little cheesy; I think Lanvall spends a little too much time on sci-fi (I have a roommate who is the same way, but fortunately, he's not a musician!), but at least they fit the atmosphere of the music, unlike those written by a certain Tuomas &quot;I paint my fingernails&quot; Holopainen, who has doom metal lyrics set to power metal. A small side note; of the three Edenbridge albums, this is the one with the least flattering picture of Sabine; aside from Cristina Scabbia, she's definitely the best-looking musician out there!The verdict: Don't expect a Nightwish album. Just because it's power metal with a female singer does not mean they're trying to clone anyone. This is a great album by a very talented band, despite what some detractors may say. Go into it with an open mind, and if you're like me, an unapologetic musician/critic with an auditory sense burnt out on obnoxious wailers like Jansen and Turunen, and you'll enjoy every second of this masterpiece. Hail METAL!!! Leave that opera stuff for the old fogies.

With their name and their theme, I was expecting Myriads to have more of an old-Tristania sound, but instead, they're fairly mellow. The girl is not a good singer. The songs are really long and don't change enough, and while it was cool they did the male choirs and strings, they really could've emphasized them more. The music is good, just not totally original. Anyway, cool stuff if you're into Norwegian gothic metal, a.k.a. the only gothic metal worth listening to.

I've always believed that Disturbed stood out in the nu-metal scene, providing more of an underground sound that managed to make it to mainstream than a pure 100% sellout band. David Draiman is one of the best clean vocalists in the metal genre as a whole, and working with a band of insane but capable musicians, he can produce a sound that will make you want to vent your anger in a less-than-constructive manner. "Believe" stuck to a rather in-the-box approach to music, and was a decline after the band's eccentric debut "The Sickness," and it features a lot of repetition. The first three songs are good, but even they lack the character of anything Disturbed made on their first album. This confirms the theory that popular metal acts will, instead of exploring the reaches of their talent, stick to a plain formula that ensures a fat check from the record company but also little differences in the songs. This type of downfall only adds fuel to the nu-metal haters' disdain for this subgenre.

I, like a few other reviewers, found Porcupine Tree through Opeth. Well actually, this album was recommended to me on CDNOW, but when I heard Steven Wilson was working with Opeth, I figured he was probably a pretty smart guy. Well, I actually managed to find a copy of this at Best Buy, and while I was actually expecting some more inspired lyrics, I was very much impressed with the music. Now, I intentionally gave it four stars because, a) this type of music generally isn't at the top of my list of favorites, and b) there aren't enough differentiating characteristics in the songs. It's not like listening to one hour-long repetitive song like nu-metal is, but it sounds like a few of the tracks are a continuation of the previous. This is not really a major annoyance, because as I mentioned, the sound structures are magnificent. The music is mostly similar to what Wilson did with Opeth on that band's acoustic album Damnation, complete with Mellotrons and giving off a very '70s prog feel. However, unlike the aforementioned Opeth effort, there are moments where the band lets loose and goes into 'metal mode,' and if you thought these guys could only do more mellow stuff well, you'll rethink your assumption. The musicianship is excellent, and Wilson is actually a vocalist worthy of a nod and a tip of the hat. I don't have a favorite track yet, as they're all pretty good. Definitely something to get if you're tired of meaningless industry slop and are looking for talent in music.

Strangely enough, I first heard about Symphony X while looking for Opeth albums on this very site. I picked up a copy of this album (ONLY Symphony X album in the store!!!) while waiting on delivery of "Divine Wings of Tragedy" from Amazon.com. I was AMAZED. The instrumentalism found on this masterpiece is simply incredible. It's obvious that these New Jerseyans put a great deal of time and effort into these songs, and the result is absolutely fantastic. The 24-minute epic "The Odyssey" is a triumph in its own right. The song starts off with an instrumental overture that could have come right out of a film about Homer's tale. Russell Allen's lyrics about Odysseus' journey are incredible; it really is difficult to tell a fantasy story like this over power metal riffs and still sound good, but if anyone can do it, it's Russell. My overall favorite is "Accolade II" (fitting, as "The Accolade" was my favorite song on DWOT). With the exception of the last song, I love them all. This album has a special place in my collection, and I have no doubts that my Symphony X collection will grow very quickly from the three albums I possess currently. I just wish these guys' CDs were easier to find in stores!!!

I don't really care for this CD. Don't know why, I just don't. I was fairly impressed when I heard the song &quot;Deep&quot; as a sample, and I like that song a lot, but nothing else on the album really struck me. There's no really crappy songs on it; nothing that makes me want to vomit after hearing it, it's just that I can't really get into it. Everything is at about the same pace, same tempo, same everything. Normally, that doesn't bother me too much, but this time it did. I'm reading a lot of good reviews, and thinking to myself, 'I should be giving this five stars too, but I don't like it.' Well, I've always been accused of having bad taste in women, could that be filtering over to my taste in music??? I hope not. Anyway, I advise taking my review for what it's worth, but concentrate on the other reviewers' comments.

Well, I was finally able to find a copy of this for a reasonable price (well, almost $20 isn't reasonable, but it's better than the $35.99 they'd have you pay for it on here), since I wanted to hear what this &quot;marvelous band&quot; was capable of doing. &quot;Oh, Floor Jansen has the most incredible voice in the world,&quot; say the critics. I can't say I agree with you. She has a *good* (not mind-blowing) voice at best; she basically sounds like she's standing atop a mountain and shouting down at someone below. Now, I didn't deduct points from the album's score for Floor's vocals, because they are good. I do prefer a lot of other female vocalists, though. The simple fact is, I don't like the music that much. The guitars aren't strong enough and get drowned out by the synthesizers. I would've liked more male vocals, because the guy who does the growls is really good. More interplay between the vocalists makes for a more unpredictable product. The killer for this album is the fact that it's 70% synthesizer music. The synthesizer work is good, but I don't like when synthesizers dominate to the point that the guitars sound like background instruments. This isn't to say that the guitarists aren't good, but they just don't do enough to stand out. So, if you only listen to metal for vocals (may I ask then, why you're listening to guitar-driven music?), then you'll probably like this, but if you're in it for the musical intricacies, then I think you might be a tad disappointed. Now am I giving up on After Forever? Not just yet; I'll probably invest in some of their other products to see if they can work out the production issues. Then they'd get 4 or 5 stars.

While this band's song structures are similar to those of lackluster bands like The Sins of Thy Beloved, their talent can hardly be described as mediocre. Each song has the ability to hold the listener's attention all the way through, and features three highly capable vocalists. The keyboardist, Dust, is one powerful and talented musician. He is also the lead vocalist; his style ranges from a highly-distorted growl to a beautiful deep singing voice, similar to Tristania's sten Bergy except a little more melodic. Actually, he sounds a lot like Theatre of Tragedy's Raymond Rohonyi at the Norwegian singer's best. Ironic, as both HLAW and TOT use the late great Sir William Shakespeare as their lyrical influence (and it's not overboard, as one reviewer states; he is their inspiration, so why not pay homage to one of the greatest English poets of all time?). There are three males (keys/vocals, guitar, bass) and three females (2 vocals, violin) in this band, which hails from Italy. The violinist Agony is really good, but I wish she would've played more. The drums are programmed, but they sound amazing. I'm not sure which female singer is which, but I think Misery is the lead and Tragedy (she's very pretty, by the way) is the one with the more operatic chanting voice. Misery isn't so great, but sounds awesome in &quot;All the Seasons of Madness&quot; when she sings in harmony with Dust. The guitars are pretty good, although they sound muffled in the electric regime. The acoustic and classical guitars, on the other hand, are some of the best I've heard, right up there with Agalloch. I'd highly recommend this album to fans of such great bands as Tristania, My Dying Bride (whom they're all big fans of), and other gothic &amp; doom metal. Black &amp; death metallers will probably like it if they like classical-influenced symphonic stuff, as well. But like Tristania, this isn't for people who only listen to stuff like Xandria and Nightwish, who like their music to be all soft and pretty and happy and who are afraid of a little growling.

I'm sorry, but La Chat is an awful rapper. She's a horrible lyricist, she sounds the same in every song (and says almost the exact same thing), and her voice is painfully annoying. Add that to her slurred words, and you get an example of why I think Three 6 Mafia should just cut the affiliate artists (except Project Pat) and go it alone. The only song on here worth listening to all the way through is "Wolf Pack" (the Posse song), in which former crewmate Gangsta Boo totally outshines the other female in the Camp. The beats are okay (by Paul & Juicy standards), and the bass lines are nice, but like I said, Chat is a pitiful rapper, ...If DJ Paul would just get his mouth out of her dirty cat and drop her from Hypnotize, then the quality of the Camp's music might just return to a level somewhere near what it used to be. Don't bother buying this unless you just want it to say you have it.

There are no thoroughly impressive songs on here, but nothing that deserves to be in the wastebasket either. The best song is Cradle's &quot;Cruelty Brought Thee Orchids,&quot; which I had already heard on their Cruelty &amp; The Beast album. The tracks by Godgory and Crematory are pretty good, the Liv Kristine track is totally out of place, and the tracks by My Dying Bride and Dismal Euphony, bands I'd heard many good things about, were thoroughly disappointing. Heck, someone compared Dismal Euphony to Tristania once - don't EVER blaspheme against the lords of gothic metal like that! The song by HIM is laughable; this band makes pop music and, like Liv Kristine, don't belong on a metal collection. The rest are just okay. Nothing to write home about.

The reason I say it's not such a wonderful product is because it can't be played on a computer CD player, nor can it be ripped. Or maybe I just got a faulty copy...As others have said, this is a different band than Opera IX, former band of Cadaveria and Marcelo Santos (f.k.a. Flegias). The lyrics are more rebellious and less satanic. Marcelo looks like a cross-dresser in the pictures and is almost as ugly as Paul Allender. Cadaveria is a great vocalist; I don't know whether or not she's using voice distorters (it doesn't sound like she is), but that girl has some of the freakiest vocals in all metal. Way better than other 'extreme' female vocalists, even Angela Gossow. Killer Bob is great on the guitars. Good product but don't expect to put it onto your computer. The new album is even better.

I normally shy away from live albums, but the nice thing about them is that you can really tell whether or not a band has talent by listening to them play live. Without the production, mixing, and sound doctoring, can a band still sound as good as they did in the studio? Often, the answer is no, but Iced Earth is a band that can make wonderful things happen. They sound PERFECT; the only thing that's different about the live album and studio albums (other than the intros and crowd noise) is that they did the beginning of &quot;Angels Holocaust&quot; with the guitars instead of synthesizers. Otherwise, once you get into the song enough that you can't hear the crowd anymore, you forget that you're listening to a live album. Alive in Athens features the band's greatest works before Horror Show, including a spectacular rendition of &quot;Watching Over Me.&quot; They play the full sixteen minutes of &quot;Dante's Inferno.&quot; I would've liked a few more songs from Burnt Offerings, as there are only two, but with an album like this, I'm not going to complain. This is an absolute must-have for any Iced Earth fan. Jon Schaffer is a great man, and if he doesn't become a metal legend, then something is really wrong with people's judgment!

This is the only Morbid Angel album I own (as of now), and I must say I'm impressed. Of course, this band is praised by Opeth, so they must be good. And they are. There's a hint of melodic death in here, but for the most part, it's the traditional sound, albeit with a lot more organization than some artists. It's heavy as hell, and the guitar work by Trey Azagthoth and Erik Rutan is some of the best in death metal. Pete Sandoval is one of the best drummers in the genre as well, incorporating speed and precision into his work and making the biggest impact on the quality of the overall product. The vocals aren't as guttural as some, but in my opinion, sound much more damning. I don't care if you're a monk, this is great music and you should get this album.

This is a great CD; very melodic, with great vocals, admirable percussion, and above-satisfactory guitar work. The keyboards and synths really help out too. I don't see how this is black metal, as it doesn't seem to fit the bill for that subgenre. The extreme vocals are definitely black-metal style, but other than that, it seems like it's one of those albums that you just can't categorize within one subgenre. Vintersorg is a great vocalist in both the extreme and clean regimes. I haven't heard Simen's or Garm's work with Borknagar yet (but will be buying those albums soon), so I can't really compare them to Vintersorg, but I know that the vocals on this album only add to a brilliant layer of melodic metal majesty. The opening song is the best, but there aren't any bad songs. The lyrics are a little difficult to understand, but they beat the usual black metal array of satanism and misanthropy. That gets really tiresome after a while. This is a great album and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in high-quality melodic metal. But it's not for you soft-hearted whiners who are offended by the 'screaming' vocals.

This is an early offering from Dark Tranquillity, some of which was recorded before Anders Friden departed DT to work for their close associates In Flames. The biggest flaw with it is that it's recorded at a very low volume, so unless the next CD you're going to pop into the player is going to be Tristania's Widow's Weeds, which is recorded at about the same volume, then be prepared to adjust the volume knob a bit. That can be irritating. Anyway, the music is really good, so it's definitely worth having in your collection. It features some rather lengthy songs, but there are none that get boring or repetitive. Good album, get today.

Beautiful. Dark. Powerful. Brilliant. Just some of the many words that can describe Opeth. MAYH, like Still Life, Morningrise, Deliverance, and just about anything else by this band, is an album to epitomize why these awesome Swedes have gotten such praise. They are not your typical &quot;make a lot of noise, scream out dumb lyrics&quot; metal band; these guys have character, and while the melodic &quot;death&quot; metal label may drive some away, Opeth is a band that anyone with any type of taste in music can at least respect. The mixture of acoustic passages, brutal growling, clean singing, precision drumming, and brilliant guitar work is at some of its best on My Arms, Your Hearse. The lyrics are, as always, very thought-provoking, taking listeners through a musical journey that only Opeth can deliver. So you have to use your imagination a little, that's called poetry. Poetry isn't some rapper &quot;creating&quot; a way to make 'hood' and 'sure' rhyme. Poetry is being able to force listeners to focus on the music and make themselves part of it, while being abstract enough to keep them thinking. In my opinion, MAYH is one of Opeth's most poetic albums to date. Favorite track: &quot;April Ethereal&quot;

I'm just getting into melodic death metal, so bear in mind this probably won't be the definitive review of this album. Basically, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before, except (this may have been said before) this is a great intro to Opeth and melodic death in general. It's a fine mix of heavy stuff with brutal growling and light melancholic acoustic work. There is a great deal of talent and versatility in this band, which is why I highly recommend this Swedish band to anyone.

Okay I'm Christian so I can say this without sounding prejudice - I have not heard one Christian band to date who can produce anything other than pointless hardcore or overdone black/death metal. It seems they're just out to show up the satanic crowd. Face it, only morons take the satan suckers seriously, so you don't need to show them up!Anyway, Extol is a pretty good band, and I didn't mind their previous efforts, but this one seems to be a regression. The songs are shorter, which is okay because they have no melodic elements to them and get old really fast. Extol's vocalist is really poor, and while I can't deny their guitar talent, I can say they might want to touch up the drumming just a bit. Their lyrics are just too praiseful; if they want to appeal to a wider audience, then they need to stop evangelizing. Furthermore, there's nothing creative about their song structures. Anyway, I'll be sticking to the secular stuff, but these guys have something to offer.

Haystak is good because he has a sense of humor. Just listen to the song "White Boy" - then tell Eminem and Lil Wyte to listen to it. There's nothing wrong with being white. Sure, Stak's voice gets a little annoying at times, but most rappers have that problem, and this guy works with it to make it presentable. "Different Kinda Lady" is deep and has a country-style beat. Excellent for a rap album.

I bought this because it was recommended along with a Nightwish album, so I figured it would at least be decent. Well, it's different. I'm not crazy about it, but it sure as hell isn't trash. The instruentals are great, but I hate to say, Kemi Vita is a horrible vocalist. She sounds okay when her vocals get drowned out by the guitars. I would've liked a few heavier songs, but it's all good.

This was the first item in my Tristania collection, as I've built my collection backwards, and while I think Beyond The Veil is far better, WOG is still worthy of the five stars. Yes it is flawed, whereas BTV is as close to perfect as you can get without being God Himself, but not to the point where it isn't enjoyable. While every track on BTV is listenable the entire way through, only four songs on WOG can keep my attention that long. The others are decent to good, but not excellent. "Selling Out" is the standout track for me, as I like the clean male vocals and the violin part is beautifully hypnotic. Vibeke sounds a lot better in some cases, but the choir parts are too loud and overpower the music, whereas they were intertwined seamlessly in BTV. "Wormwood" is a good song despite its [bad]concept, and "Tender Trip on Earth" is good once you drown out the Osten/Vibeke chorus part. They can hold vocals fine on their own, but they sound awful put together. "Deadlocked" is a softer track, very emotional.Einar and Osten seriously lack Morten Veland's songwriting ability, as their songs are not poetic anymore, but simply focus on how pathetic their lives are. Also, since Einar is apparently the new front man, you notice a lot more electronics used in this one, although unlike what Theatre of Tragedy (blah...) has been doing lately, they haven't lost their legitimacy as a metal band. Anders' guitar riffs are painfully simple in many cases, and Ronny Thorsen doesn't have anywhere near the growling ability that Morten had. The songs are slower, and therefore SHOULD sound darker and heavier, but without Morten's musical genius to make a magnificent listening experience, the result is choppy and overloaded with synth. But if Tristania has done one thing right since their feud with Morten, they haven't lost their complexity and dark beauty.In conclusion, it's no Beyond The Veil by any means, but hell I'd buy it again just for "Selling Out." It's a very good album, better than anything you'll hear on American radio, so while hardcore old Tristania fans will probably hate it because of their ignorance and closed-mindedness, those open to something new will find something great in this masterpiece.

...Well, maybe it did, but not to your humble reviewer. Anyway, Galder [is awsome] in this project, and with Nicholas Barker on the drums, it's not an album to put yourself to sleep to ... The first song isn't an immediate catcher (although it's not bad once you get into it), but skip to track two and, unless your preferences in music include MTV rap and pop, you're not going to be pressing the skip button any time soon. The maelstrom lets up only toward the end with "In Quest of Enigmatic Dreams," which was certainly worth the break for. "Black Seeds on Virgin Soil" is the highlight track, but just about every song is good and worth playing through all the way. There's much more emphasis on guitar and percussion than you'd find in Dimmu Borgir (the two are always compared, especially now that Galder and Nicholas have taken full-time parts in Dimmu), whereas the more popular band places its weight behind the synthesizers too much of the time. Vocally, Galder can't quite match Shagrath, and he sticks to the black metal scream without venturing toward the death growl. Galder and Jardar nail the guitars, so music critics will find a lot to comment upon in that area. So, if you're a black metal fan, or want to become a black metal fan, then IDOE is a marvelous album, and since it's quite melodic, it's more accessible than, say, a later Emperor album for people new to BM. If you're a Christian and are offended by the first song title, well, [that is too bad]; you're missing out on some great music. The cover art is nice... cute little succubus! Anyway, get this album now... Satan wants you to... okay that was stupid... but get it anyway because Galder is amazing!

I didn't care much for Decipher, because I really don't like the transparent, muffled texture of the guitars. But on this album, they fixed the problem, and they are truly worthy of five stars. I had considered giving it only four, for exactly one reason, but I figured all the rest cancelled it out. That one reason is that the growls are absolutely awful. I'm normally the type that likes a mix of clean vocals and growls, but on this album they sound pathetic. That's about the only thing they lost with Mark Jansen's departure. I think this is a million times better than Epica's Phantom Agony. First of all, Floor Jansen can actually sing. I don't care for Epica's Simone that much. She doesn't suck, but Floor is much better. She actually sounds like she belongs in a metal band, unlike a lot of female singers. Again, I really wasn't thrilled with her on Decipher, but here she shines. The guitar work is splendid, the synthesizer sequences fit perfectly, and the choirs and orchestral arrangements are very well put-together. Unlike a lot of bands/albums who use such arrangements, this was not a desperation move on After Forever's part. The story line is very interesting, although there are some lyrics that get a tad repetitive. But with everything else going on on this album, you tend to forget. This is quickly becoming my favorite female-fronted metal band (which really isn't saying much, as the novelty of such bands has worn off, but believe me, this band is good). I recommend this easily over anything by Nightwish, Edenbridge, Lacuna Coil, or Within Temptation. The only albums of 2004 (of this subgenre) that I feel deserve to be on the same level as this are Lovelorn by Leaves' Eyes and the masterpiece An Elixir For Existence by Sirenia. Get this TODAY!!!

I don't like much electronic/darkwave/whatever this is music, but this group is pretty straight. Their music could be really hypnotic if the whole album didn't sound like one long song. All of the songs are played at the same tempo and really lack a whole lot of distinguishing features. I've heard some of their other stuff and might buy other albums because they sound more varied than this one. Basically, if you only listen to one or two songs at a time, this is worth having in your collection. If you like a lot of this kind of music, then you probably already have this, but if not you'll love it.

This album confirms my worst fears... Hypnotize Minds is scrapping the streets of Memphis for rap artists. I wasn't too impressed with Frayser Boy at first, but he's redeemed himself, but Lil Wyte flat out has no appeal. His style has no consistency, and the SuperProducers really seemed to have rushed this one out because the beats are less-than-average for them. All I can say is I hope they get Project Pat out of jail soon because, with the back-burner role they've confined Lord Infamous to and the slew of mediocre artists they've been signing on as affiliates, Hypnotize seems to be going rapidly downhill. This is probably just a bad CD, which is inevitable for a label who has over 30 albums available to the general public to their credit. It'll go down with Indo G's &quot;Angel Dust&quot; as one of Paul &amp; Juice's worst ever.

Meshuggah is insane. These crazy Swedes truly define the term "HEAVY metal" - and they do it with style. The sound is primitive, only enhancing the technical and brutal atmosphere of this powerful album. No soft stuff, no lovey-dovey [stuff], no bland or repetitive cliche sound, just pure metal perfection. The lyrics are very good; well thought-out. Of course, Meshuggah isn't for everyone, so beware. I like this better than Chaosphere, but that album is good too. Those are the only Meshuggah albums I have right now (tight on $ at the moment), but I intend to buy more. This is a load of metal that will make pansy Linkin Park & blink-182 fans shake in their little pink booties.

I got into Iced Earth on the advice of a friend, and this was one of my first albums by the band. It's a spectacular display of how metal should be made. No hip-hop-style programming, nothing to overpower the guitars, and magnificent musicianship. Jon Schaffer is a musical genius. There are more mellow songs on here than any other Iced Earth album that I can think of, but in contrast to others, the softer stuff on here is very well-executed, demonstrating Iced Earth's versatility. The vocals of Matt Barlow are half the fun of listening to it, as he sounds absolutely possessed in many of the songs. Not much more I can say, except get this album. And make sure you pick up my personal favorite, Burnt Offerings, as well!

Tristania, once at the forefront of symphonic and synthetic metal alike, runs the ship aground with their fourth full-length offering. Einar Moen, the keyboardist who was basically the heart and soul of the band, is almost absent from this piece, leaving it to the overachieving but less-than-musically-adept guitarist Anders H. Hidle to run things. The songs have a distinctly modern sound, even bordering on metalcore at times. Anders' riffs are fairly repetitious and boring, and his use of discomforting arrangements and flat notes doesn't help a bit. His playing is somewhat melodic, but lacks any type of aesthetic structuring or technicality, making the listen fairly dull and ambiguous. The growls of Kjetil Ingebrethsen are unintelligible; unlike the crystal-clear sound of Morten Veland and Ronny Thorsen before him, all you hear from KJ is "raargh raargh RAAAAAAARRRGGGHHH!!!" Vibeke has effectively sealed the fate of her singing career, because she sounds like she went on a chain-smoking binge. There is no texture or emotion in her voice at all, aside from some irritating sighing. Osten Bergoy, the main source of vocal talent in the band, is again confined to back-burner roles. I don't understand this; he writes the lyrics to half the songs, so why doesn't he let himself sing more?But onto the good points. Rune and Kenneth (bass and drums) are really allowed to shine here, which is good, because Rune in particular is highly underrated in his field. The songs aren't bad per se, but certainly do not measure up to the compositions that Tristania has created in the past. The thing that made Tristania attractive in the first place was the sheer complexity and intricacy of their works, and this new 'organic' direction means that the songs are painfully simple and stripped-down. No choirs at all, save for all three vocalists singing together in "The Wretched." By the way, it has 8 tracks ("Bird," the standout track, isn't listed), and the digipak has 9 ("The Gate" is the bonus; haven't heard it yet). All in all, three long years after the powerful and excellent World of Glass, the band comes back with a woefully weak effort.

If you hear the words "Viking Metal," you're probably expecting something heavy and ruthless like Bathory or Amon Amarth, right? Not so from Falkenbach's "Ok Nefna Tysvar Ty." While its lyrics describe Odinism and the Viking conquest against those evil Christians, the music itself is very melodic and beautiful. Vocal styles get repetitive, but you lose yourself in Vakyas' fantastic voice. The ardency of the flutes, which are prevalent in this release, is the thing that will catch most listeners first. This is not to say that the guitar work is not fantastic, because while not technical or fast, it is very good. There is a lot of use of acoustic and classical guitars as well. I recommend this to any Viking Metal fan, and also to fans of Agalloch, Sol Invictus, and Opeth.

Deliverance is definitely the heaviest album Opeth has produced, and it's also one of their best. Peter Lindgren's guitar sounds totally different; it's much heavier, and the sound variation between the electric and acoustic guitars is far more noticeable than in previous albums. It's not quite as good as Morningrise, but they'll probably never top that one, and this will do good enough to tie for second with Still Life. The first two songs are the best, but each of the five full-length tracks is of the high standard that we've come to expect from Opeth. The interlude is pretty good as well. The drumming is mind-blowing; Lopez really made a name for himself here if he hadn't already. As far as vocals, well Mikael Akerfeldt has yet to disappoint. Opeth truly deserves their honorary title of "metal's most brilliant band," and they prove that with Deliverance.

One of their earlier albums, The Jester Race/Black-Ash Inheritance (a combination of a full-length album and an EP) remains my favorite in my now-complete In Flames collection. From the acoustic beginnings of the stunning song "Moonshield" (in my opinion, In Flames' best song to date), the five Swedes deliver an undeniably damn-near flawless performance with this one. It keeps one's attention through a balanced mix of heavy melodic "death" metal (I really hate calling it that, because death metal is such a bland, boring, and unimaginative subgenre in general) and mellow acoustic tunes, in a vein similar to fellow Swedish metal masters Opeth. But where Opeth makes long, epic songs with many tempo changes, In Flames' songs are typically average length with more predictable switches from the heaviness to the softer parts. The Gothenborg sound, originated by the band, may be a little difficult to get into, as it is somewhat of a primitive sound (deliberately, enhancing the atmosphere created by the music). In contrast to Opeth, In Flames concentrates more on heavy parts, whereas with Opeth, you often get a nearly equal balance of heavy & acoustic. Both schemes work well, and it's hard to decide which scenario is more appealing. Lyrically, In Flames is one of the more introspective bands, not focusing on satanism or killing religious people or any of that overdone and cliche [stuff]. Their lyrics make you think, and most people can relate to them. It's almost like a narration of life, albeit with somewhat of a dark twist thrown in at points.So now, my faithful review-reader, I invite thee... open thy mind and check out In Flames today! If you're not a complete bonehead, you'll probably like what you hear (of course, if you don't like it, that doesn't necessarily make you a complete bonehead by default...).

As far as production is concerned, this is the best of the Triple Six Mafia underground releases, for the sole purpose that some of the tracks (not all of them) are up to par with the rest of the industry. There are three or four that sound like they were recorded in the basement, and they don't fit in at all. However, the album is worth buying just for "Da Summa (Remix)," "Smokin On Da Dro," "Sleep," and "Lock Down." If you're not a huge Three 6 Mafia fan, save your $.

Bill O'Reilly is (*gasp!*) a media figure who presents material in an unbiased fashion, and while he may seem overly opinionated, the man says it as it is. He attacks the liberals who try to fool the American people into believing their lies and following their master plan, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of ethics in humanity. From blasting Puff Daddy to digging up dirt on Jesse Jackson (one of the main people responsible for the continuation of racism), O'Reilly asks questions that Americans NEED to have answered. Now, I don't agree with Bill on everything; for example, he's too soft on abortion. You're either for it or against it... well, if you have a conscience, you're against it, but conscience doesn't exist in America anymore... anyway, there's no middle ground. This is great reading for anyone truly concerned with the fact that America is going down the toilet because of corrupt politicians, morons in the entertainment industry, and flat-out high-profile liars. Of course, liberals (I don't hate you for the way you feel, I just don't agree with you) probably won't like it. Fortunately, unlike Rush Limbaugh, who does more to hurt the conservative cause than to help it, O'Reilly has the ability to control his Irish temper and resist the urge to rip some folks a new one... although sometimes the temptation overwhelms him! But for the most part, I found this to be a very good depiction of why this very vocal "right-winger" feels America needs to reform.On a side note, I think it is worthy to mention that one of the most beautiful aspects of our freedom as Americans lies in our ability to voice opposing opinions and not be punished for it. You may not agree with Bill's point of view, but I personally feel he bases his opinions on thorough research, analysis, expert opinions, and other means to produce the point of view that best suits his moral standing. Very entertaining reading.

To 'Sergio F. Morales': Who cares if it's not 'REAL goth metal'???Anyway, I like a select few Moonspell CDs (although, you may label me a heretic, but I don't care for Wolfheart) and while this is my least favorite of my 'spell collection, it's definitely better than anything by Type O Negative. The vocalist has style and knows how to sing, unlike a lot of male 'goth' singers. I'd easily recommend Darkness &amp; Hope over this, and Sin/Pecado is high on the list, but The Antidote (aside from showing a slight hint of wanting to sell out) is still a quality product. On a side note, actually this is pretty important to people concerned with TALENT (you know, the important part?) and not just how cheesily 'goth' they are in image and conformity thereto, Moonspell is one of the only gothic metal bands to play commendable guitar solos. Rock on!

I give Clayman four stars because it essentially seems like a continuation of Colony, or even a bridge between Colony and Reroute to Remain. It has well-produced material, and it is full of In Flames' characteristic excellent musicianship, but it really didn't stand out as something innovative. It's quite radio-friendly, so die-hard lovers of old In Flames should probably stay clear. It is a very enjoyable listen, aside from Anders' pitiful clean singing, so it's worth picking up if you're one of those more open to the new direction In Flames is taking with their music. It's very catchy, possibly too catchy for some, but it's great for gatherings and will suffice as entertainment for a long drive.

Sculptured is the main project of musician extraordinaire Don Anderson, who may be best known for his work as one of the two guitarists in the genius Agalloch. Sculptured incorporates a little bit of Swedish-style melodic death metal, but mixes it with some jazz, some prog, and some other elements. Nothing that any of the members of Agalloch have worked with fits into just one category, and while Sculptured may be the easiest to describe (except maybe Nothing, which is simply dark ambient noise), this band certainly doesn't play by any 'rules.' Mr. Anderson has always said that his music is an art, and he plays it accordingly. This album gives Anderson a chance to show his strengths not only as a guitarist, but also as a keyboardist, bassist, and vocalist. He has a very nice growl, similar to Anders Friden of In Flames, and not the hollow black voice that John Haughm of Agalloch uses. Speaking of Haughm, he does some backing vocals on the first song. There are some trumpet pieces too, which may seem sappy and corny, until you hear it. There are also some great, prog-type clean vocals. Anderson shows that he really is a great guitarist who can play just about anything. He is also a capable composer. So in conclusion, any fan of Agalloch or melodic death metal needs to pick up a copy of this album today. I also recommend the band's newer offering "Apollo Ends," and "Nondescript" by Nothing (J. William W.'s ambient project, featuring John Haughm and Michelle Loose). By the way, to all those silly pinheads who said Agalloch and Opeth sound even remotely alike... listen to this album, and you might actually be able to pick out some Opeth influence, along with the My Dying Bride nods.

I can see why some people would not like this album, especially if you go into it expecting something similar to Tristania or metal-era Theatre of Tragedy, but my personal verdict is that it was a great purchase.The songs are much more mellow and symphonic than what you'd hear from, say, Tristania's Beyond The Veil. You can't really compare the two, but for argument's sake, I still listen to Tristania more than Penumbra. Anyway, the female singer (why the hell did she call herself 'Medusa'? She's about as ugly as a Rolls-Royce is cheap) is excellent, and the extreme vocals are almost flawlessly executed. The guitar use is not constant or consistent, but it is worthy of mention, and the bass actually stands out quite nicely in some cases. &quot;Testament&quot; is the standout track for me. The band employs great keyboard and synthesizer arrangements, and enhances their sound with the use of a four-member orchestra (2 violins, a viola, and a cello) and an eight-piece choir. All placed together, the resultant sound is passably unique and very enjoyable. As far as lyrics, the story line is pretty creative, and (*gasp*) it's not a load of blasphemy!On a side note, I'm really getting tired of reviewers whining and complaining about the use of death/black vocals in this type of metal. People, it's metal, it's not supposed to be all pretty and sensual. I play in a local band, and I use extreme vocals in addition to clean singing, and I tell people that, if they don't like it, then don't listen to it. But it's no reason to degrade a whole band just because you don't like their choice of vocal arrangements. They are still talented and passionate musicians; honestly, if you had any idea how much throat control it takes to produce that kind of vocal, I think you'd respect the musicians a lot more. For those who can accept a band for not selling themselves out to become 'the biggest thing in Europe,' and making music the way they feel it should be made, then I think you'll like this album. Heck, you'll probably love it; God knows I do!

This CD is really only for true Tristania fans, and isn't the one to start with. It combines their self-titled debut (first four tracks) and the Angina EP/single (last three) on one CD. Four of the songs were released, albeit in slightly different versions, on other albums, these being &quot;Midwintertears&quot; and &quot;Pale Enchantress&quot; from Widow's Weeds and &quot;Angina&quot; and &quot;Opus Relinque&quot; from Beyond The Veil. &quot;Sirene&quot; is a decent instrumental, but not really worthy of any kind of great praise. &quot;Saturnine&quot; is a nice closer and probably should've been on BTV instead of &quot;Dementia.&quot; The only full-length song with vocals that wasn't released on a later album is &quot;Cease to Exist,&quot; which, coming in at 9:17, is Tristania's longest piece. It's a more mellow song, and features only Vibeke Stene on vocals. You'd think it would be a great showcase of her exceptional talent, but she whispers most of it. It's still a very good song and in my opinion, was worth the price alone for.The other four songs, as I mentioned, are not unique to this album, but there are differences between them and the versions released on the full-length albums. The 'radio edit' of &quot;Opus Relinque&quot; is a full minute shorter than the one on BTV and sounds different. &quot;Angina&quot; lacks the synthesizer intro, which is how I would've liked to have heard it on BTV since it was right after the piano segue. The two songs from Widow's Weeds are of lower production quality, and the vocals aren't woven into the music flawlessly as they were on the LP. There are no violins on &quot;Pale Enchantress;&quot; the violin parts are done on the synthesizer.In short, if you're already a big fan of Tristania, get this for the sake of completeness, unless you want to spend a lot of money and get the debut album and the EP (good luck finding that one). The cover art isn't really creative (it's the band pic that's under the CD tray in Beyond The Veil), but does that really matter?

Skinny Pimp has to be the most repetitive rapper in the industry. Don't waste your money. He should stop talking trash about Three 6, because he's not any better. You know why he's an "underground" artist? BECAUSE HE [is bad].

I just wish they had waited until they had better equipment to record it on. Definitely some of the best lyricism ever to be put onto a rap CD, particularly Lord Infamous' and Koopsta Knicca's lines. D.J. Paul did some lyrical tricks too, but Gangsta Boo and Juicy J did too much "gangsta" and not enough horror-core. I want the satanic evil brutality stuff about mutilation and torture, not people getting shot! That's too quick. (I'm not into Satan worship or anything, I just like lots of brutality in my music). Therefore, this is definitely something every Three 6 Mafia fan should have, but I'd recommend buying "The End" first.

Anything that Three 6 Mafia turns out is far above hip-hop industry standards (which isn't really saying much) in my humble opinion, but this tops them all. This intricate blend of semi-horrorcore lyricism and unmatched production will never be equaled in the rap music industry. Most of my friends aren't rap fans at all but still like this album. Lord Infamous dominates with his demonic poetry and brilliant lyrics, while Koopsta Knicca's almost psychotic singing is the icing on the cake. Songs like "Stomp," "Where Da Killaz Hang," and "Last Man Standing" are good examples of these vicious verbal atrocities, while songs like the introspective "In-2-Deep" and the hypnotic relationship song "Late Night Tip" add a welcome amount of variety to the album. Lord Infamous displays his vocal versatility and solo rapping capabilities in "Where's Da Bud," while Koopsta steals the show from The Kaze in "Life Or Death" which has a beautifully morbid piano loop at the end. The only downside to the album is the almost comical lines that Juicy J. puts into some of the songs. Otherwise, classic material from a greatly underrated rap group.

I'd agree with the other reviewers that this is FAR from being In Flames' best work; in fact, I'd probably call it their worst, but it's not a total waste. The Genesis cover (&quot;Land of Confusion&quot;) is horrible; I liked the original and I love In Flames, so I was really anxious (but not optimistic after reading these reviews) to hear what the band could do with it. Well, they successfully slaughtered it. The edit of &quot;Trigger&quot; is good, as was the original on Reroute To Remain, and the remixes are, well, interesting, and pretty good for something different. &quot;Watch Them Feed&quot; is okay, nothing spectacular. So in the end, it was surely not a waste of money, but it's by no means the band's most spectacular offering.

Giving TSOTB 3 stars is being generous. They've got nothing on (old) Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. Whereas those two bands have some variation (and know when to end their songs), TSOTB writes long songs full of disparity and overused violins. Anita Auglend's voice is not very good. Whoever said she's a better vocalist than Amy Lee is nuts; I don't think Evanescence is the greatest band around but come on, Anita sounds like a synthesizer talking. What's next, Anita Auglend is better than Vibeke Stene or Tarja Turunen? She's obviously someone's girlfriend because her voice is flatter than the Great Plains. If you're looking for gothic metal, then get Tristania or Sirenia first. TSOTB's nine-minute draggers have no inspiration; they're all about cliche topics and you can't understand a word that Anita or Glenn say. Glenn's death growl is pretty good, but only for ambience.That was just the vocal shortfall. The only instrument that they make work properly is the synthesizer, which isn't much of an accomplishment. They have two keyboardists, which I find questionable. Pete "I'm insane" Johansen handles the violins, which are whinier than Anita's voice. They sound good if kept in check, but "Worthy of You" has three minutes worth of solo violin on the intro and it's unbearable. The guitars might as well not even be there; I think you can hear the bass more than you can hear the leads.So, in my mind, this isn't gothic metal, it's "goth" music. I make a distinction because gothic metal (Tristania, Sirenia, pre-Musique TOT, a couple other bands) features talented musicians and meaningful songs. "Goth" music (like Marilyn Manson and, hate to say it, Moonspell) is made by people who read too much Anne Rice and H.P. Lovecraft, and is all about wearing black and making synthesizer songs with no appreciable creativity. Now to be fair, TSOTB don't completely blow, but their songwriting, compositions, and playing fall way short of what I'd consider record deal material, but then, Napalm has a reputation for signing some pitiful artists (Belphegor, Abigor, etc.). There's a reason they haven't made an album in four years. They're devoid of any inspiration. They're too sad and depressed to be making music. I'd only recommend this if you're a total emotional masochist.Let's put it this way: Listening to The Sins of Thy Beloved is like driving down a road at 25mph through a farming town. You can do it if you try hard enough, but you probably want something faster to escape the rotten smell of manure.

I love Opeth. I love what they've done with metal, particularly the bland subgenre known as "death" metal, turning it into a listening experience beyond the casual listener's comprehension. But for some reason, as hard as I try, I can't get into Blackwater Park like I can their other albums. Still Life caught me off guard immediately, and I can play Morningrise over and over, but Blackwater Park seems to have something missing. Maybe it's because it doesn't appear (to me) to be as melodic, and is a little more primitive in sound. It's raspier, the guitars are a little crunchier (?), and so on. But I still enjoy it more than a lot of other "death" and "black" metal. Anything by Opeth is surreal and hauntingly beautiful. This is not a bad album by any means; I don't believe that Opeth is capable of making a bad album. For the fans who say their acoustic passages are too "soft", I'd say you are just a reject trying to act big and bad and you wouldn't know music if it were shoved down your throat with a sledge hammer. While it takes a little more getting into than other Opeth albums, Blackwater Park is still highly recommended by yours truly. There's enough heaviness to make TRUE metal fans (not punk-ass posers) happy, but also enough of that folk-influenced acoustic work that makes Opeth a truly unique and masterful band. Go get it today.

I bought PEM on impulse, and I liked it, especially the drumming. Having been pleased with my purchase, I went on to add Spiritual Black Dimensions, and it was pretty good as well. Sooo... now time to get Dimmu's newest offering... not so good. Basically, there's not enough variation in the songs, and Nicholas Barker thoroughly fails to impress. The band places way too much emphasis on Mustis' keyboards/synths; he's skilled at what he does, but this is supposed to be METAL, not classical. If they didn't label their music as &quot;black metal,&quot; then one wouldn't be so misled as to what one would be hearing. I didn't know that being a satanic band singlehandedly qualified you to be black metal (I was reading an interview with Shagrath and he used that as his sole reasoning for them being black metal). Anyway, Shagrath's voice is a little more whiny on here than it was on PEM, and Vortex only sings on one song, although he does lay down a good bass guitar rhythm sector. Galder and Silenoz don't do anything worthy of great mention, and I'd just as soon Abbath have been left out. They don't need guest vocals, especially when they're both using distorters.The lyrics on this album are horrible. It's not that I'm against satanism or anything; hell, they can worship guano for all I care, as long as they're not just doing it for the image (which, sorry to say, Dimmu Borgir are). But they're weak. PEM and SBD had intelligent lyrics, but DCA is just anti-Christian and anti-society raving. What I really don't understand is, Silenoz claims that the band is totally anti-religion. Satanism IS a religion! Cult followers are the biggest f*cking hypocrites to walk the face of the earth; they claim they're against organized religion, yet they ARE an organized religion! The band all but admits that the satanic image is just to get them recognized. Why don't they just find something more interesting to talk about?Anyway, the addition of the Prague Symphony Orchestra (or whatever it was) is kinda interesting. Otherwise, it's just a continuation of PEM, albeit with far worse songwriting. I doubt I'll ever buy another DB album. I'd recommend the new Cradle of Filth album over this any day. At least Dani can write decent lyrics that are intelligent and not overused.

Despite being an incurable sadist and having a somewhat disturbed personality, I find most black & death metal to be fairly boring and unimaginative. But there are, of course, exceptions to the rule, and Arch Enemy is one of them. Now, being a Swedish band, I had high expectations for these folks, as I'm a huge fan of Opeth & In Flames. That was where I was let down. Whereas In Flames has a lot of character and puts deep thought into their lyrics and complexity into their songwriting, Arch Enemy is basically the same "I hate God, I want blood and guts" that makes me hate stuff like Death and Mortician. The difference between the generic (boring) DM bands and Arch Enemy lies in the melodic structure of the music. Arch Enemy has a more fluent sound than traditional death bands that, while remaining heavy and brutal, has a sense of dark beauty to it. The addition of minimal keyboard parts enhances the atmosphere. Basically, their lyrics and vocal delivery are the downfall. The lyrics aren't bad per se, but not up to par with my expectations for a Swedish band. On the vocals front, Angela Gossow is one of the better extreme female vocalists out there, making many of the bands that use extreme female vocalists (Kittie, Otep, My Ruin, etc.) sound like they have a little girl screaming, as those bands' vocalists tend to sound flat and repetitive. Gossow controls her throat quite well; she'll never be any Chris Barnes or Morten Veland, and she's not quite as brutal as Opera IX's Cadaveria, but she can do great things with her vocal cords, despite sounding not the least bit female.As far as instrumentalism, I'm gonna get blasted for this, but it's just not heavy enough. It just doesn't sound like melodic death metal. Plus, after listening to the bonus disc, it sounds like they lowered the bar a notch when they recruited Angela, and the music is watered down from previous albums. It's not soft or wimpy by any means, but among the Swedish melodic death bands, Arch Enemy is the one that will be least intrusive on first-timers. As I've mentioned before, they're also the worst lyrically. If they just wanted to do the blood & guts thing, they could've at least done what Cannibal Corpse does and made it humorous, but hey it's good enough. As for best tracks? I'm partial to "Savage Messiah," even if it does appear to be satanic. The guitars are good; the Amott brothers at least know how to play. Drumming isn't bad either, and the few instances of keyboards work out well. In the end, it's not my first recommendation in the realm of melodic death metal (although it's hard to recommend anything over Opeth), but it's worth checking out. I'll probably end up buying some of Arch Enemy's older stuff, and maybe even the new one.

If this is the best D.J. Paul can do, then I guess T-Rock wasn't lying when he said Lil' Pat does all of the beats for Three 6 Mafia and Paul just takes credit for them. Juicy's album was solid, but this isn't anywhere near what I expect from an HCP album. It sounds like it was rushed; like Paul decided one day that he'd make a solo album to show off what a wonderful producer he is, and the result is horrific. Out of 14 tracks, two or three are worth listening to. Some of the stuff is old (i.e. "Where Is Da Bud Pt. II" and "D.J. Paul" - creative title, eh? ...). Paul killed an already horrible beat when he gave "Twist It, Hit It, Lite It" (originally a T-Rock song) to Crunchy Black.If this wasn't a Hypnotize album, I'd be more lenient, because 99.9% of other rap music is complete and utter garbage. But HCP is (or at least was; now that T-Rock, Koopsta Knicca, Gangsta Boo, and The Kaze are gone and Lord Infamous hardly ever raps anymore, they're all but dead in the water) normally much better than other rap. Save your $.

Sirenia's debut &quot;At Sixes and Sevens&quot; was a great album, but for all its high points, it failed to explore anything near its full potential. First of all, almost every song was built off of the same riff, the same synth sequence, and the same vocal structure, so it tended to feel like one very long song. But seeing as he was kicked out of his old band Tristania only a year and a half before the album's release, I can imagine that he was more eager to just get something out and prove he was still around. But with &quot;An Elixir for Existence,&quot; he's back to kick the dust off of his shoes and show his former bandmates that they can stab him in the back all they want, but it'll be little more than a slap in the face for him.One downside is the new female vocalist, Henriette Bordvik. She's certainly not bad, but her vocals seem to be a little empty, unlike the previous singer Fabienne, who had a more ethereal and emotional, seductive &quot;Sirenian&quot; voice. Also, J.K. Barkved is absent and the clean male vocals are left entirely to Kristian Gundersen, who has more of an 80's rocker voice than a metal one. He only appears in three songs, and sounds like he has a cold. Veland doesn't dominate many songs vocally; it's usually an even split between him, Henriette, and the choir, which now boasts a third female voice. The only other musician on this album is Anne Verdot, the violinist, as Morten plays or programs everything else. And he's good. The instrumental closer proves that he's not only a killer vocalist and guitarist, but he can handle the keyboards with just as much (and I almost dare say more) skill as his former colleague Einar Moen. Standout songs? In my opinion, all but &quot;The Fall Within,&quot; which sounds like a leftover from ASAS, deserve 5+/5 stars. So, if you like old Tristania and you liked Sirenia's previous effort, you will love this Elixir for the mindless mediocrity that plagues the music industry as of late.

Let me first say that anything after this isn't worth buying. Without Copernicus working the sequencers, Aesma Daeva turns into an empty attempt at classical compositions, with enough holes in it to sink the Bismarck ten times over.Here Lies One... is AD's swansong. Their main strength lies in the programming; the all-electronic songs (Disdain, Stay, Darkness, Stromkern) are pure perfection in that department. The mix of hypnotic sequences and keyboard lines and flawless operatic female vocals is found nowhere else. Some have compared this act to Dargaard; this is accurate on some level, especially vocally, but AD's sound is more geared toward electronica and metal rather than straight darkwave. The metal tracks suffer from a lack of a bass guitar and too high a pitch on the guitar, but Prassas can execute the axe pieces just fine. The a capella part on Sanctum is amazing as well. Highly recommended.

This album had the potential to be the defining moment in slow, heavy doom metal, but the fact that every song sounds alike hurts it a lot. "The Wreckage of My Flesh" and "Catherine Blake" are both great songs; most of the rest is too except "My Wine in Silence." Aaron's vocal structures tend to get annoying, and when he growls/screams, you can hear the voice distortion. Anyway, aside from the tribal-style drumming heard in a few places and the pounding bass, there's nothing really to comment on. The funeral organ synths sound good, and the guitars, well, they're slow. That's about all there is to it. Buy this instead of Shape of Despair, and be sure to check out all of MDB's other works.

Blind Guardian is one of those bands that people seem to either love or hate. If you're into noisy and angry nu-metal, or only listen to death or black or gothic metal, then you'll hate them. If you like old Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Manowar, then you'll love them. If you fit into both categories (except the nu-metal part), then you'll love them because they're a great band. Somewhere Far Beyond is my second Blind Guardian, and I like it more than Nightfall in Middle-Earth (the other BG album in my soon-to-grow-larger collection) because SFB doesn't have any annoying narratives, plus the guitar solos are a lot better and more prominent. Hansi's vocals reign supreme this time around; I didn't care much for his pseudo-operatic-mixed-with-80s-wailing vocal structures at first, but he really is an energetic and capable vocalist, not to mention a commendable bassist. The drumming is fantastic, and as mentioned before, you're going to find some great guitar work on this album. It even features a guest appearance by Kai Hansen. Highly recommended to fans of REAL metal (Limp Bizkit is NOT real metal)!

I'm not a big power metal fan, so I'm not going to bombard this piece with blissful adoration. I like it, but it's not wonderful, and the 20-second narrative pieces are way overdone. I understand that it's a concept album, but this has more narration tracks than most CDs have tracks period. I think I counted twelve. Other than that, vocalist aside, these guys really know how to play. The guitars are fast - VERY fast - so speed metal fans will really dig this. The drumming isn't too shabby, either. But the thing that stands out the most is definitely the double guitar work. Even though I'm a bassist, and have never touched a lead guitar (except to look at it), I can definitely say that the riffs they play are not easy, but they make it sound so routine. They don't OD on distortion or effects, but use them where appropriate. Hansi Kursch's vocals don't appeal much to me, but then I don't like 80s-metal-style vocals. Anyway, it's a good concept album about a great tale by Sir Tolkien, but I cannot stress how much more consistent it would've been without all those barely-audible skits.
