Alternately funny and heartbreaking, A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS brings back the turbulent emotions of childhood holidays--and throws in a great batch of beautiful music to boot.I have to say that, while I've loved this show my whole life, as an adult I've begun to find it almost disturbing. Amidst all the Christmas cheer and pagentry, the exchange of cards and gifts, wanders poor Charlie Brown. He doesn't seem to have a friend in the world--even his dog Snoopy and his companion Linus ridicule him--and there are no adults, no parents seen anywhere. His dispair over the bent tree is so real, and so heartbreaking.Thank god for those one-liners, eh?&quot;Whaddya mean, Beethoven wasn't so great?!?&quot;

I enjoyed &quot;In The Heart Of The Sea&quot; for about 200 pages, the first 3/4 of the book which is your basic stranded/survival story. Once the survivors are rescued, Philbrick loses his storytelling ability. Characters stumble all over each other in a confusing mismash. Even Philbrick's writing gets worse in the last 50 pages; there are several sentences towards the end of this book that are simply incomprehensible.

RE-CYCLED VINYL BLUES represents the first time I have ever been disapointed by any music Neil Innes has been associated with.Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but I always thought Innes was an overlooked genius who could turn virtually anything into an interesting tune. This CD proves me wrong. The production is thick and muddy, the playing is slow and slovenly, and the lyrics are dull and lifeless.The only redeeming tracks here are "Lie Down And Be Counted," an acoustic strummer with a sense of humor and some tasty backing vocals, and "How Sweet To Be An Idiot," which fits in with some of the very best of Innes' catalog. Too much of the rest of the record sounds like Innes and some studio hacks trying to fulfill contractual obligations.Thank God for the Rutles.

BACK TO THE EGG suffers from the same problem as so many McCartney/Wings LPs: after a promising side 1, side 2 dies.There is some reprieve from that problem on BACK TO THE EGG; after the drudgery of &quot;Winter Rose/Love Awake&quot; and the sheer boredom of &quot;After The Ball/Million Miles,&quot; there's the oddly touching &quot;The Broadcast&quot; and a thrilling &quot;So Glad To See You Here,&quot; maybe the best rocker Macca did since BAND ON THE RUN.

I'm glad to see KOSS has stopped making this waste of money machine.All of the complaints about the recording side which you'll see in all of the other reviews are accurate: It is very picky about which CD-R's it will accept (rejecting about 1/4 of every pack I tried over the past 18 months), it forces a gap between tracks whether you want them there or not, it determines (based only on its mood) how much time it will allow you to record on each blank CD, and, most maddening of all, it keeps going into &quot;recovery&quot; mode, which basically means it's tacking on about 30 seconds of dead air after each &quot;recovered&quot; track. Since you can not control the record level, each tune is recorded at it's original level, and that varies from source to source--so your CD's play volume is all over the map if you use different sources. And lately it's not even putting a ceiling on the volume, so I get finished CDs with horrible distortion levels.I won't be buying any more KOSS equipment, that's for sure. I'll spend the extra bucks for a decent recorder--and the KOSS is going out with Tuesday's trash.

Ella Fitzgerald is the greatest American vocalist ever. Her series of Songbook LPs showcased her masterful voice singing the best from American composers. This CD selects the best tunes from those LPs.I doubt that a better CD of American Jazz and Traditional Pop is possible; I know none exists.Listen to Ella sing &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,&quot; and you have heard perfection.This CD is great on it's own, but it's really just the starting point. Save up the money and buy the 16-CD box set of the entire Songbook series. It's worth every penny.

Ella Fitzgerald is absolutely untoucheable, a sizzling voice and one of the smartest singers you'll ever hear. The opening phrase of &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; is as sweet as it gets.She's always hot stuff, and this LP was recorded during a time when her voice was at an absolute peak. She could do anything, and Basie's sassy arrangements bring out the best in her.I do have to question the last 8 or 10 tracks on this CD, however. Is there really a need for three versions of &quot;My Affair?&quot; Or four straight renditions of &quot;Robbins Nest&quot;?

The only Beatles LP mocked by the press during the 1960s, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is actually an odd little masterpiece.All of the Beatles shine here: McCartney's bass playing is masterful, Ringo's drumming unusually loose and, as always, driving, Lennon is at the height of his peace-n-love weirdness, and Harrison simply rips the place apart with the heavy duty "Blue Jay Way." Is there anything on vinyl more ominous than the organ and bass intro and the first line: "There's a fog upon L.A...."?MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR also contains both sides of the greatest Pop single of all time, "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane," both masterpieces in their own right. Their inclusion alone makes this a disc everyone should own.

Quite possibly the greatest film of all time, APOCALYPSE NOW was sniggered at in pre-reviews and, upon release, dismissed as &quot;really wierd&quot; by one prominent film critic in my area.Van Gogh wasn't recognized during his time, either.For all the trouble Coppola had bringing his masterpiece to the screen (documented in a fantastic documentary, HEARTS OF DARKNESS) including star Martin Sheen having a heart attack and the Marco's continually repossessing helicopters to fight Philipine rebels, the final product is an amazing amalgom of war film, psychological introspection, and updating of &quot;Heart Of Darkness.&quot;This film works on every level. I consider it the absolute pinnacle of filmmaking. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough.

Bogart portrays one of the grandest attitude adjustments in cinematic history: he's tough, he cries, he kills, he loves, he is just flat out heroic. Ingrid Bergman is stunning, absolutely gorgeous, even her voice is sexy, and Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, all playing classic characters.The Nazi's are slimey and even the most anti-Gallic viewer will get a lump in their throat when the French national anthem drowns at &quot;Deutchland Uber Alles.&quot;Try to count how many scenes in this film have become American cultural icons, imitated and parodied now for nearly 60 years.

Is WHITE CHRISTMAS corny? Sure.Is it predictable? Yeh, a bit.Is it Christmas without it? Absolutely not.It's got a sappy old General, the most popular American song of the 1950s, a glamorous snowy finale, and, best of all, Rosemary Cloony. Her voice is more cloying here than on her jazzier recordings, but still has that sexy turn to it. And man-o-man, when she smiles, there just ain't anything better.

My friend, Andru The Engineer, has written the be-all and end-all book on the moment that froze female hearts throughout the western world. It wasn't enough that he married Linda Eastman; then it looked like he fell off the planet.This is an exhaustive look at the phenom that swept AM radio and even took in some of the 'serious' media. It was one of those stories that was totally bizarre, but you'd catch yourself thinking &quot;yeh, but what if--?&quot;Andru and I spent many hours--probably way too many for his parents taste--watching HELP! and A HARD DAY'S RUT on the TV in his parent's den. I'd like to take some credit for inspiring him to begin this book...but that would be quite a stretch.

It's truly a shame that this amazing documentary is now out of print. Hunt down a used copy or find it at your local video rental place. It's well worth the effort.The amazing thing about the Coppola's efforts is the circular karma that seemed to go into overdrive: Francis tries to make a film based on &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, a story about a man and a country that gets lost in his mental interior while probing the interior of an alien land. He uses the story to try and tell the story of a different man and a different country getting lost in their mental interiors while probing the interior of another alien land. In the process Coppola, trying to deal with his lead actor getting lost in his mental interior while probing the interior of an alien land, loses himself in his mental interior while probing...well, you get the picture.

Like SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, LET IT BE has been the subject of such heated debated and intense scrutiny over the years that the album itself is almost overlooked in all the hub-bub.LET IT BE was, for years, my favorite Beatles LP. Looking back I realize it is because LET IT BE, along with certain moments on RUBBER SOUL and much of the WHITE ALBUM, allows listeners to feel as close as possible to the Beatles. Beginning with "Two Of Us," most of LET IT BE sounds as if the Beatles are sitting with you in your living room, playing just to play.Of course, there are moments destoyed by Phil Spector. "The Long And Winding Road," a nice little ditty by McCartney, sung and accompanied by piano, is turned into a nightmarish, sugary-sweet power ballad by Spector, who soaked the tapes in syrup and sprinkled sugar and a cherry on top. McCartney was furious, and had ever right to be.That's a real shame, since McCartney is the only Beatle who seems to have put any effort into LET IT BE. Lennon is virtually non-existant, providing only odd one-liners that nobody laughs at, and confusing lyrics that are neither poetic nor meaningful. Harrison plays poorly, over-relying on a bad fuzz box. Even Ringo, who is the heart of all great Beatle music, seems disinterested, coming to life briefly on "Let It Be."If LET IT BE does nothing else, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that George Martin was a vital, irreplaceable piece of the Beatles. Without him, the band floundered.

This is not one of my favorite Holiday recordings.After reading some of the other reviews I feel like I missed something. Because, to me, she sounds tired and flat on this record, not her usual tricky, flirting, powerful self. The arrangements are too slick, too...tired, for me.

GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is a Pop Masterpiece.Elton John, for at least the first decade of his recording career, was an absolute genious of Pop, making more great singles in a shorter span of time than anyone in history.He was not, however, a Rocker in the classic sense, or the 1960s sense anyway. That is, his focus was almost entirely on singles, with cogent, conceptual albums only an afterthought.GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is the perfect marriage of the two; a collection of masterful singles which form a loosely concieved world on one LP. It is an album filled with winos, rednecks, loose women and losers worthy of a Stones LP, all held together with sweet melodies and some of the tastiest piano-playing ever heard on a Pop record. Bernie Taupin, often accused of having the easiest job in Pop history--handing over lyrics to the melody-machine Elton--reached the absolute pinnacle of his career on this LP, Elton took the time to put each to a great tune, and Gus Dudgeon matched each song up with an ideal musical setting.The only downside to this CD is that all of the great packaging that came with the orignal double-LP is gone or reduced to jewel-box size...

After all the years, all the hype and--holy cow--451 amazon.com customer reviews, what is there left to say about SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND?Maybe we should set all of that aside, and realize that there is really a very good album hidden behind all of that rubbish.Starr had been playing seminal drums for years, creating a whole new attack on &quot;Tommorow Never Knows.&quot; On &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; he introduced the world to the thunderous drum entrance.McCartney had been playing melodic bass for a few LPs, on Pepper he takes it to new heights. His voice hasn't reached the level of perfection it would hit from 1968-1976, but it was reaching a point where it's warmth, depth and technical skill would soon be unmatched.Lennon had given the world a glimpse of his Lewis Carrol/Dylan Thomas influence on RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER, but it really comes into full bloom on PEPPER. Looking back, PEPPER is the only Beatles LP where Lennon seemed content and happy. Perhaps because, as on DOUBLE FANTASY, the only other Happy John LP, it came after a time of relative seclusion: the Beatles left the road in 1966 and spent months holed up at EMI making PEPPER, &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;; the Lennonos spent 5 years at Dakota before making DOUBLE FANTASY.Harrison is given only a minor role on PEPPER, but makes the most of it. A second dose of eastern influence, only hinted at on previous Beatle records, is passed around on &quot;Within You Without You.&quot; Amazing to me, according to the sheet music, this song is played entirely in C.It's a great album, from start to finish; &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; stands as one of the greatest recordings ever. George Martin should have been given a knighthood and then some for putting together this kind of straospheric beauty on a 4-track machine.I've read where George Martin says the Beatles originally recorded the &quot;Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane&quot; single as the first tracks for PEPPER, but were pressured by EMI to release them ahead of time. Imagine the impact this album would have had with the inclusion of those songs, two of the greatest tracks you'll ever hear.So, is PEPPER the greatest album of all time? No. PET SOUNDS, BLONDE ON BLONDE, WHO'S NEXT, several Beatle LPs, and several others are right up there with PEPPER. Add &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; to PEPPER and you'd have a better argument.But is PEPPER the most important album of all time? Without any doubt. This was the dividing line between Pop and Rock, the moment where two worlds, one peopled by Teen Beat and the Flip Your Wig game and American Bandstand, and the other creating Rolling Stone and Haight Asbury and Woodstock, went their seperate ways.It was the moment that youth culture began to be taken seriously, by the establishment and by baby boomers themselves.It was the moment that the Beatles finally and irrevicably seperated themselves from the pack, reasserting themselves as the best thing since the invention of the friggin' wheel.It was a great band flexing it's muscle, putting all the world on notice that they were the once and future Kings.By the way...when was the last time you listened to SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST?

Just a perfect record. There is so much swing in this LP, and it comes out of a handful of instruments.The vibes rule the record, but it is Peterson's piano that holds down the fort from beginning to end. Tasty bass, economic drums, and a sharp choice of tunes.The soft intro will fool you. Two minutes in you will find yourself ready to move with it, and it doesn't let go.I have gone through 3 copies of this record--2 vinyl and 1 CD--over the past 20 years, and I never get tired of it.This ranks with the best of Mingus or Miles Davis, in my book.

...Beatty and Hackman are great, as usual. Parsons's Oscar is baffling to me; she howls and cackles throughout but doesn't do much else.What makes BONNIE AND CLYDE is Faye Dunaway. Her performance is beyond anything any woman attempted between WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLF and SOPHIE'S CHOICE. The fact that she didn't win the Oscar is stupifying.And she looks like a million bucks.

Linus of Hollywood sounds a little Beatlish, a little Beach Boyish, and even a little like America. There are some nice moments here, but the pretension of the name--Linus Of Hollywood--comes out in the music too. There are moments on it where I feel like artist and producer sat down and made a concerted effort to include every Pop and Bubblegum pretense into each title; I keep expecting the kitchen sink to come flying out the speakers. The attempt at cute &amp; witty is just a bit too transparent.There are some things I really like a lot. &quot;Building A Ship&quot; is good, though I could do without the &quot;Greensleeves&quot; flute parts. &quot;I've Lost My Mind&quot; is kind of nice but--here comes the kitchen sink--the oh-so-whacky keyboard and synth break kills it.This is what Emitt Rhodes would have been with too large a budget. Perhaps there's a more restrained approach in the future that will let these melodies rise above the overproduction.Worth a listen, but don't expect to walk around humming these tunes for any length of time.

There are times when Moore is kind of funny, in that cringe-at-the-embarassing-moment kind of way, and there are many, many more times when his holier-than-thou, we-are-the-world pontificated just wears thin.I was sucked in by the hype of ROGER & ME and then found it dull and less than informative, and I have to admit that I was sucked in for a second time on BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Once again I was misled. Moore does mocumentary humor a lot better than the self-agrandizing proselylizing he too often stumblers into.On the other hand, any film that can expose Charlton Heston and the NRA for what they are deserves at least 3 stars. Heston is exposed as a fraud and a carny. The lighter moments of the film warrant another star; Moore's own showboating--the final moment of the Heston interview, where he props a photo of a shooting victim in Heston's courtyard, for instance--will make you want to throw up.

Keep in mind the credits on this CD before you buy: it is Sinatra AND Dorsey and, as such, the spotlight is not entirely on Sinatra.As one reviewer has already pointed out (while missing the point), this is music from a big band whose fine singer went on to become a legend. But, at the time, it was the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra with Frank Sinatra; it was only decades later than people began calling it Frank Sinatra &amp; Tommy Dorsey.That said, this is a fine release. Dorsey swang, though the Sinatra of the 1950s probably would have looked down his nose at some of the whitebread-honking solos on these tracks. Pre-war swing and cold-war swing are different animals.Sinatra does his idol-and-nemesis El Bingo one better on &quot;Learn To Croon&quot; and plays his part well, but it's still hard to understand how the skinny Brooklyn crooner became the Chairman Of The Board and The Voice in later incarnations.

I first heard &quot;Stranger On The Shore&quot; on an old vinyl double-LP called &quot;The Roots Of British Rock,&quot; which eventually slipped away from me. It was a great piece of work, which featured Acker Bilk, Cliff Richard &amp; The Shadows, Lonnie Donegan, and a few other artists who had hits in Britian prior to 1963.There are quite a few Acker Bilk CDs out right now. I can only assume &quot;Stranger On The Shore&quot; must have popped up in a commercial or some soundtrack. It is without a doubt the highlight of this record. There's something magic about that mix of strings and clarinet.It's a magic that is never repeated again. &quot;South of The Border,&quot; &quot;Don't Fence Me In,&quot; &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;Jean&quot; are the absolute definition of Schmaltz, Schlock, or whatever else you want to call it.If you've ever sat in a dentist chair, having your teeth drilled with just a bit too little novacaine, and thought even that would be OK if they'd just turn off that gawd-awful dentist office music...here's the CD version. You can have your very own copy.

I bought this book for my son and he seemed to enjoy it--there are plenty of great photos and some interesting, if wordy, stories--but what is the obsession with sports writers to divide all baseball books into nine &quot;innings&quot;? Football writers don't feel any need to split their books into four &quot;quarters,&quot; golf writers don't limit themselves to 18 &quot;holes.&quot; In this book, as in so many others, it is a clumsy cliche.

I guess I'm not the first one to note that this is the LP McCartney would have made immediately after leaving the Beatles, if he'd been more focused on pop song structure and AM hits at the time. Instead he made MCCARTNEY, a great album more suited for the more open formats found on FM.Back to Rhodes. This is a fine, though flawed, album. The first 6 tracks display a pop sensibility so similar to McCartney's--complete with lead bass lines, feathery vocals, and sing-a-long melodies--that the comparisions are inevitable. But Rhodes doesn't mimic McCartney. To put a (slightly) more current spin on it, this isn't the Rutles, it's ELO. It isn't Oasis, it's XTC.After track 6 (the perfect &quot;Fresh As A Daisy&quot;), it's a crapshoot. &quot;Live Till You Die,&quot; which in the depth of pretension is quoted in the gatefold, is more condescending and trite than anything Cat Stevens or Dan Hill wrote in even their worst moments. &quot;Promises I've Made&quot; is quite good, but &quot;You Take The Dark Out Of Night&quot; has B-Side written all over it.Back when I had only a vinyl copy of this LP, I used to listen to nothing but the first side. It was one of the best sides of Pop you'd ever want to hear.

Manchester has obviously infuriated 'history buffs,' who have learned all they know of the age from &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and suburban Renaissance Fairs, by pointing out in a popular format what most students of history already knew: Medieval and Renaissance Europe and England were filthy, disease-ridden places with little food and a continental chasm between the very few wealthy and huge masses of the incredibly poor.It was not the elogant age many like to imagine, but it did set the stage for all that was to come after.Manchester is a fine writer and this is a fine book.

Despite the awkward attempt at a hit single with the opening &quot;Good Times Bad Times,&quot; LED ZEPPELIN is an impressive recreation of the stage show the band, which had morphed from the New Yardbirds to Led Zeppelin only months earlier, was riding through Europe.Highlights include a sizzling version of &quot;You Shook Me,&quot; a dazzling guitar solo on &quot;Dazed And Confused,&quot; a nearly punkish &quot;Communications Breakdown,&quot; and the absolute blitzkreig of &quot;How Many More Times.&quot;What set LED ZEPPELIN and, for that matter, Led Zeppelin, apart from a whole host of British blues LPs and bands in 1969 was Jimmy Page's production and, to a lesser extent, his guitar playing. Both are operating at peak levels on the band's first LP.

Well, I hate to spoil the party, but I found this CD disapointing at best.The bands are certainly Big, but they sure aren't swinging. I love swing--but it ain't here.The sound is flat, flat, flat, as if the bands played at one end of a huge warehouse and the microphone was set up at the opposite end. Most of the performances are a few beats too slow, and the soloists sound uniformly tired.On the other hand, the cover art is repugnant.

I don't think anyone had reason to expect an album of this caliber from George Harrison at this late date.But BRAINWASHED is no ALL THINGS MUST PASS, no matter what a few dander-headed mass media spin doctors have been saying over the past few weeks. ATMP was a flood of Rock masterpieces that Harrison had saved up for years, a spiritual announcement that created an entirely new genre of music; BRAINWASHED is a bright and sunny collection of fine Pop tunes. They're both grand records in their own light, but comparing the two is like comparing albino mice to Saturn's rings...what's the point?What I find most surprising on BRAINWASHED are Harrison's vocals. When has he ever sang lead so well? There is a depth and resonance in his voice here that hasn't been captured on record before.I've been trying to narrow down to 2 or 3 my favorite songs on BRAINWASHED and I just can't do it. The man had trouble putting together solid LPs his whole career, always putting a couple of classics amidst a stack of faceless meanderings, but that trap is avoided here. True, there aren't any tunes I would call classic or life-changiing, but everything is solid. "Any Road," "P2 Vatican Blues," "Run So Far," "Rocking Chair In Hawaii," and the instrumental "Marwa Blues" are all fine stuff, and I have to admit I've listened to "Between The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" about 16,000 times already and loved it more each time.There is a bit of that Traveling Wilburys sound on BRAINWASHED, which makes complete sense since half of that band collaborated on this CD. But, while I liked the Wilburys, I think this is more of a complete record than they ever put together. I have none of the complaints about Jeff Lynne's production that I've heard from some others; I don't see the walls of flowery mush they point fingers at. I always wanted to hear Harrison do those lush choir-like multiple vocals he did on ALL THINGS MUST PASS again, but I suppose that just wasn't in the cards for this record.This is not a great record--it never tries to be--but it is a very good one, better than 95 percent of the junk being released today. It may not be ALL THINGS MUST PASS, but it's certainly better than 33-1/3 or GONE TROPPO--or WALLS AND BRIDGES or LONDON TOWN, for that matter.A lot more fun than the typical Harrison album, BRAINWASHED seems like a fine, fond farewell from the most misunderstood Beatle. He was witty, wise, occasionally caustic, a bit eccentric, and was the Fab'er to have found a way to live the All You Need Is Love life within the framework of a Pop star lifestyle. When I think of Lennon I can't help but think of his odd-politics of the early and mid-1970s, but when I think of Harrison I see the monk-ish poster from ALL THINGS MUST PASS and the nerd-gone-cool kid dancing to his own lead guitar part on Ed Sullivan. I think, in the end, he got to say goodbye to this world the way he wanted.Now if only Clapton can find a way to release the Harrison tribute concert on CD...

Ignore the nauseating hype-machine that seems to grow out of any conversation concerning Robert Johnson. All the talk of &quot;deals with the devil&quot; and &quot;tales of infamy&quot; obscure the fact that he was a great, great guitar player and singer.One good reason to listen to this music is because it makes Keith Richards guitar playing more obviously part of a continuing fabric, and it makes it pretty obvious what Keith was listening to when he settled on a singing style. Jimmy Page obviously got a lot out of these recordings too.But I'm falling into the modern-day trap now too.Forget who influenced what, forget all the garbage about tracking down Johnson's roots, and figuring out if he really sold his soul to gain his ability, yadda yadda yadda.Instead, play this record, LOUD. It's great stuff, and can stand on it's own.

The Who worked and worked and worked to make themselves the best live band on earth, and it paid off to such an extent that a die-hard Beatles fan such as myself became a full-bore convert to Townshend and the powerhouse that was, in Roger Daltrey's words, "that bloody awful Who."There are striking similarities between the Isle of Wight show and LIVE AT LEEDS--they were recorded within just a few months of each other, after all--but these are different shows. I prefer the sound of LIVE AT LEEDS--the echo is warmer--but that is nitpicking. They are both great live LPs in their own right, and owning both is the way to go.

Cary Grant is great in HIS GIRL FRIDAY--Cary Grant was great in everything he ever did--but it is Rosalind Russell who makes this film for me. She was an atypical film actress for her day, playing a middle ground between the typical starlet and the tough-gal Betty Davis type. Russell is tough, tart, and totally believeable as Grant's ex, an independent beauty who wants a man but can do without him too.Whadda woman!As for the script, it's one of the wordiest around, quick and clipped, witty and inescapeably sharp. If Charles Lederer wasn't recognized for this screenplay, there was fraud afoot.

Though not the best Shankar, Monterey was his first major attempt to open an American audience, and this is a very good CD.The Tabla solo is particularly good. I am partial to the Tabla, though not often as a solo instrument--I think they've been done to death in bad action movies--but this is lively without over doing it.

This is one creepy album.On previous records, Waits toyed around with homeless, slightly crazy characters. Here, Frank's visions of grandeur fall flat on their face and he ends up, at least by my reading, a drunk on the streets. There is madness, real madness, running through this record.To coin a scientific phrase, this record gives me the willies.Not to say there aren't good songs here. Most of them are excellent. But, with the exception of the stunning &quot;Yesterday Is Here,&quot; &quot;Cold Cold Ground,&quot; and &quot;Train Song,&quot; they are painfully hard to listen to. Makes you feel like you're stuck in a haunted house.&quot;The bats are in the belfry, the dew is on the moor...where are the arms that held me and pledged to love before?&quot; That is the resolution here, the final sentiment of the closing the tune. &quot;You're innocent when you dream&quot; doesn't sound hopefull by the end of FRANK'S WILD YEARS, it is a defeated voice rationalizing past mistakes.This isn't the best Tom Waits but, if you can fight off the ghosts, it's still a very good LP.

I know Stephen King loves the pulp genre; so do I. The difference is that I didn't slap together half a novella and try to cash in on pulp's recent resurgence. King did.When King is good he's very good, but when he's bad he's self-indulgent and maddening. The Colorado Kid is an example of the latter. Three overly cutesy, annoyingly precious two-dimensional characters chug tea, cokes and coffee while recounting a not-very-interesting "mystery" from years ago: a man is found dead (he choked on a sandwich) and no one is sure why he was at the spot where he was found dead.The resolution? There is none. None.King just sets up the "mystery"--what little there is of it--and then types THE END. In a five-page afterword King explains that the story was meant to illustrate that we all live in "a web of mystery."Oh brother.

Such a warm, charming album. It's as if Garrison Keiler handed over the stage of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; to the McGarrigles, and they refused to give it back for a whopping 21 songs.The selections are eclectic--including titles from Stephen Foster, Irving Berling, Cole Porter, the McGarrigles, and a host of traditional tunes--yet work together to create one grand harmonious form, like a giant American quilt.I sound a bit NPR-ish, I know, but I was so surprised at my reaction to this record that I push it on everyone I know. If you're a fan of good singing, or American traditional music, or just plain good music, you will love THE MCGARRIGLE HOUR.

Much of ACHTUNG BABY is high-grade U2: very, very good Rock, with excellent guitars and the most muscular voice in latter-day Rock. Enjoyable, danceable, thoughtful stuff.Then there's &quot;One.&quot;Has there been a better Rock single? Maybe. Maybe a few. But &quot;One&quot; is such a stunning, stunning record that it puts the rest of this CD to shame. Like &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and a few others, it is built from simple pieces and overflows with a mix of emotions--anger, fear, determination, and some kind of overriding love, I mean the BIG love, that Krishna-conciousness world-love stuff--that you cannot help but be moved by it. I've heard multiple explanations of it's lyrical intent but, again like &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; (and all great art) the meaning each listener finds in the piece is what counts.&quot;One&quot; is an all-time great piece of music that everyone should own.

People have always been happy to quote Lennon, about LET IT BE, saying he wanted the Beatles to be seen &quot;naked...warts and all.&quot; But Lennon got Phil Spector to produce his early solo stuff, and while it's stripped down, it's produced to cover those warts. McCartney, who included a photo of himself with his finger up his nose in the gatefold of MCCARTNEY, shows a few warts on RAM, along with signs of the Pop masterworks he'd release later in the 1970s.Thing is, as the years wander off towards the horizon, I'm finding I like some of the wartier stuff the best. &quot;Uncle Albert?Admiral Halsey&quot; is interesting, and brings back memories of trying to figure out the lyric while lounging around the neighborhood pool, I like that gutter voice and snotty lyrics McCartney pulls out on &quot;Monkberry Moon Delight.&quot; I've always liked the free-wheelin' goofy-ness of &quot;Eat At Home.&quot;And &quot;The Back Seat Of My Car&quot; is one of the most underrated McCartney tunes of all time.

Along with STEAMIN' and 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT, KIND OF BLUE, makes the argument that Miles Davis was the most influential Jazz men of the 20th century.KIND OF BLUE is the best of the three and, to my ears, one of the 2 or 3 best Jazz albums ever recorded. &quot;So What&quot; is perfection, slipping and sliding through subtle changes and flashing a band like nobody has ever heard before or since.A truly amazing record. Absolutely classic.

The most underrated McCarney album and, arguably the most underrated album of the 1970s, AT THE SPEED OF SOUND is the most complete Wings album. It's the only time the complete Wings sounded like a complete band.Eventually everyone got McCartney's &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; point, but it was amazing to listen to critics stumbling all over themselves during the summer of '76, first ridiculing the song, then slowly starting to pick up on the lyric, then deciding it was McCartney showing the old backbone that had been missing since the split.&quot;Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs--and what's wrong with that?&quot;This was also the LP that reestablished McCartney as thE bass player of his generation. Why he's shyed away from the instrument the last 15 years is beyond me. He is, without a doubt, the finest melodic bassist I've ever heard.

Along with the Who's LIVE AT LEEDS and the Rolling Stones GET YER YA-YAs OUT, Bob Marley's LIVE! stands as one of the greatest live LPs ever recorded.The version of &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; on this CD is thE ultimate Bob Marley recording, full of love and passion, tender and sweet but still tough and rock solid. A perfect performance.&quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; shows the opposite end of the Marley spectrum. It is pure revolution and, if you live in Babylon and don't feel your hair standing on end during the chant at the end of this record, you ain't listening.

Carlos Santana has put together one of the most successful longterm careers in the history of Rock using a simple formula: his music is unobtrusive, it appeals to a growing niche, and he is an absolute master of his instrument.SHAMAN sounds pretty enough--personally I would have toned down the obviously dubbed group backing vocals--and it wouldn't offend your Aunt Berta, but there are times, particularly on "Nothing At All," where Santana's heritage is used so cloyingly that it comes close to pandering. In the past Santana's roots added tone and color to his records; on SHAMAN there are times when you feel you're listening to the soundtrack from a bad episode of The Cisco Kid.But maybe my taste of late has swung so far towards Pop that I am blinded: I think "The Game of Love" is far and away the best thing on this CD. Michele Branch sings Pop with a perfect blend of sugar & soul in her voice. It's lightyears ahead of the misguided Rap loser "Since Supernatural," the most embarassing mistake to ever appear on a Santana record.My continuuing disapointment with Santana is that, for all the genius in his guitar playing, for all the super production and attention to detail in his recordings, he's never changed the basic formula since the days he played free Saturday afternoon shows at Golden Gate Park. Each Santana record sounds great, but they also don't sound a heck of a lot different from each other. Anyone who's invested in all of Santana's albums has a stack of discs that are virtually indistinguishable from each other.That said, he remains the most under-rated guitarist of the last 30 years. His playing, closer to Jeff Beck, Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix than anyone else, is always thE thing to listen to on his records.

This is my summertime CD for 2002, and that is a total surprise to me.As a rule I think dub and remixes have been a major league bore for more than a decade. The mind-numbing dependence of most dj's on a handful of stock sounds--the James Brown clip, the Prince clip, the whole Art of Noise box of cliches--wore the whole genre to a dull edge long ago.This CD has me rethinking that whole criticism. It helps that the vocals come from some of the 20th centuries greatest talents, but the mixes are warm and earthy and sweaty hot, not the tinny repititious borefests that turned me off a few years back.Not surprisingly, the very best tracks are constructed around two of the greatest American vocalists of all time, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. Fitzgerald's "Wait 'Till You See Him" sounds sexier than the original--I would have bet that wasn't possible--and Holiday's "Don't Explain" is just fantastic. Listening to Holiday is always an eye-opener; here the result of putting that magic voice in the midst of a modern mix is truly hypnotic. The Nina Simone and Sarah Vaughn tracks are hot too.Maybe the greatest evidence that this is a great piece is the remix of Dinah Washington's "Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?" The original was sacherine and slow, with the instruments mixed wayyyyyyyyyyy down, kind of a vanilla pull at what is really a pretty spicy lyric. But the remix here is hot, marching and in your face, with a dirty horn part and a drum clip that I think may have been taken off Grand Funk's "American Band," of all things.This is what hot, sweaty, romantic, sexy summer music should always be.

This album is so--and I mean this in the best sense of the word--it's so DIRTY.Beyond the lyrics--filled with hookers, junkies, losers, criminals of all kinds, back-stabbers, liars, and on and on and on--Keith and Mick seem to have taken in all of New York's then-trendy nightlife and spewed out all the worst of it--but the SOUND.The guitars never soothe, there is none of the strumblin' acoustic wash of previous LPs (save the mocking &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot;) none of the sickly strings that slop all over &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;...this is just razor-sharp Fenders. Watts drums aren't thumping, they're hard-edged Whacks.Great singing--maybe the last great vocal LP for Mick--and &quot;Before They Make Me Run,&quot; one of the big 3 from Keith.I love this LP, but, years after I bought it and hid it in my room, and with threee kids of my own, this is one of only a handful of LPs I never play if my parents are within earshot.It's great rock, but it has that [sort of trashy] feeling...

A fine, if somewhat dry, account of one of American journalisms finest hours.I'm rather shocked by some of the other reviews of this book which claim that it "proves" Woodward & Bernstein were "wrong," implying that Nixon et al were innocent. The episode those reviewers seem to be referring to was not an example of a reporter getting it wrong but rather being intentionally being misled by sources. There is a difference.And the fact is that they got it RIGHT. Of all the co-conspirators, Nixon was the only one who never could bring himself to admit his own guilt.This is why I become a news reporter.

I supposed it's Pink's self-imposed &quot;Tough Girl&quot; image that makes her critics overlook her great voice. And, as anyone who has seen her live (or on her recent appearance on Saturday Night Live) can attest to, Pink's act is for real, and works outside the studio, unlike too many of her contemporaries.But the songs on this album are weak, to say the least. They are so dull, flat and lifeless that even Pink's powerhouse singing can't resurrect them. &quot;Trouble,&quot; the best song on the record, is a perfect example: energized and slamming for about 2 minutes, and then it goes into repeat mode and nothing happens...and keeps on not happening for another 2 minutes. Pink's backing band sounds like 50 million other suburban bar bands across the planet, including a lead guitarist who sure knows how to play scales and seems to have bought a really wicked set of effects pedals...just like every other guitar player between the ages of 14 and 25.It's unfortunate, to say the least, that Pink is wasting her obvious talent on this kind of boredom.

Wow.I absolutely love this record.Two GIANTS of American music together. Not Sinatra singing along to pre-recorded tracks by a bunch of 2nd rate singers, as he did towards the end of his career, but two of the true legends of jazz singing classic tunes together while at the peak of their abilities.Ella Fitzgerald's voice is sheer perfection, Armstrong's horn is not the hot jazz of his earlier stuff, but still swings like nobody's business--and to hear Louis Armstrong sing is a thrill that I never tire of. The horn solo on &quot;Love Is Here To Stay,&quot; probably a throw-off for a master like Armstrong, swings and sways till you just want to scream.Everybody--and I mean, EVERYBODY--should have a copy of this LP.

Generally speaking, if I say a soundtrack is better than the movie, I mean the movie wasn't any good. OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is a wonderful movie, but the soundtrack is better.Alison Krauss sings like an angel, the Whites show off the kind of full-throated tones that make traditional American music so attractive, and the Soggy Mountain Boys version of &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; rocks and rolls in a way only the greatest Bluegrass can.Buy it. I've had it for a week and have listened to nothing else.

THE WHO SELL OUT, not TOMMY, is the greatest Who LP of the 1960's, though it suffered on the American charts.This may be the greatest snapshot ever taken of swingin' London, and it the wittiest and most group-oriented Who album. They sound like a BAND here, a funny, rough, song-oriented band.Buy it because it's way cool.

I was a tad dissapointed with LIVE AT FILLMORE AUDITORIUM, because I've never been very interested in Berry's slow stuff and there's nearly wall-to-wall true blues on the LP.On the other hand, it's Chuck Berry, and he IS the king of Rock'n'Roll, so how bad could it possibly be?When I saw Berry in concert about 15 years ago, he was still doing shows like he'd done for a couple of decades: pickup bands, or just one step better than that, everything in A, and make up the playlist as you go. The band here is Steve Miller's, there is the occasional tune in B or G, and the playlist is surprisingly berift of the better known Berry songs. He focuses instead on slow blues and a couple of drifting jam sessions.But I could listen to Berry play his wandering leads on that red hollow body all day long. He's occasionally sloppy, but so was Jimmy Page and I liked his stuff too.A word of warning: the versions of &quot;Reelin' And Rockin'&quot; and &quot;My Ding-A-Ling&quot; are NOT the hit versions. &quot;Reelin' and Rockin'&quot; chugs along just fine; &quot;My Ding-A-Ling&quot; isn't as good as the hit single, which was recorded in the UK...and a lot of people didn't think the hit was too great to begin with. &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is thE disapointment of the album, starting as a slow dirge before shifting into a franticly uptempo mess.

Despite a bit of sluggishness in the fourth fifth of this book, Heller managed to create a truly great book in a manner nobody had ever successfully pulled off before.Like the equally great SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE--really the only significant novel thematically similar to CATCH-22 written in anything like Heller's style--CATCH-22 is usually labeled an anti-war novel. I disagree. I think both are pro-humanity books. Heller and Vonnegut, like Voltaire centuries earlier, both seem to have reached a place when writing these classics where they could no longer stomach the absurdities of their day. It wasn't just war that nauseated them; it was the ease--the eagerness--in which they saw men become animals.They are, unfortunately, depressing books. Great books, but depressing nonetheless.

The best Pogues LP is the classic IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH GOD.PEACE &amp; LOVE is a strong second place.I suppose the reason the Pogues never hit in the USA is that they are &quot;too irish,&quot; just as the Kinks, the Jam, XTC and the Clash were &quot;too English.&quot; Personally, I think it's because American radio programmers remain &quot;too stupid&quot; to recognize good music unless it's packaged and promoted to death.I can listen to this CD all day long--I often do--with the exception of &quot;Gridlock,&quot; a misplaced cop-show theme song, and &quot;Blue Heaven,&quot; a piece of fluff that must have been slipped onto the master tape by mistake.&quot;Night Train To Lorca,&quot; &quot;Misty Morning Albert Bridge&quot; and the masterful &quot;London You're A Lady&quot; are among the best things the Pogues ever recorded.

Shame on the Pogues American label for dropping this fantastic album from their catalog!This is a flawless record. The Pogues were never more energetic, creative, witty, and on and on and on. The title track alone is worth the price of admission.I really liked the Pogues prior to If I Should Fall From Grace; this album made me love them. &quot;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing 'Galway Bay,' and the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day...&quot;

ThE Monster LP for every guitar player who wanted to Rock, not solo.The secret here is that this is a Keith Richards record. the riff-meister was able to keep Mick, then entering his jet-set mode, smoking and drinking long enough to record a bluesy set of hard FUN. &quot;Rip This Joint&quot; (bing-bang, you're my thang) kicks, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; is one of the three Keith classics (along with &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Before They Make Me Run,&quot; Watts/Wyman have that tight-loose thing rumbling along, and the horns roar like a highschool marching band on heroin. Which they may have been, if you follow me.Anyone who claims to love rock and roll--or even blues, or rock, or pop--and doesn't have at least one worn copy of this LP is missing out on one of the big ones.

When The Jam, Morrisey and XTC--among others--failed to crack American radio, you had to know rock was dead (I mark the death of Kurt Cobain as the final nail).The Jam were latter day Who, just as the Sex Pistols were latter day Rolling Stones. That's a tag Paul Weller spent years dancing around, but for the uninitiated, it's a fine reference point.This is a fine CD, but be sure to track down a copy of their great live LP, which has fantastic versions of Start!, That's Entertainment, and All Mod Cons.

As cocky and short-sighted as Oasis with twice the energy, the Jam was completely ignored in the USA. That's a shame, because America missed out on one of the best short careers in Rock.Their early career was hobbled by fairly blatent attempts to recreate the first 2 or 3 Who LPs, but when they hit their stride the Jam was hard to top. On this Greatest Hits package, the change begins with "Down In The Tube Station At Midnight," and carries right through a series of fantastic singles that raced up and down the British charts: "The Eton Rifles," "Start!," "That's Entertainment," and "Going Underground," possibly the greatest Pop/Rock single never heard by most Americans.Latter-day Jam dipped a little too heavily into blue-eyed soul and French pop for my taste, but the representative singles here--especially "The Bitterest Pill" and "Beat Surrender"--are still better than most of what you heard on American radio at the time.Was the Jam a Who knock-off or the second coming of Mod? And does it make any difference? Debate that if you want, but enjoy the music.

The aural upside, and lyrical downside, of EXILE ON MAIN STREET, STICKY FINGERS provided FM-radio with a handful of standards still played two decades later, and gave fans an insight into the heroin-induced hell Keith was in.Though not as all-encompassing as EXILE, nor as friendly and cozy as LET IT BLEED or BEGGARS BANQUET, STICKY FINGERS is a classic nonetheless. It was a blueprint for 70s hard rock, and gave the prettiest moment on any Stones LP, &quot;Moonlight Mile.&quot;Much of the credit has to go to Mick Taylor, the only man to ever quit the Rolling Stones and live (until Bill Wyman, anyway), and an underrated guitarist. Keith was starting his decade-long slide, and Taylor more than picks up the pieces.

Easily the best solo Macca LP, BAND ON THE RUN has aged well, seeming as warm, fresh and creative today as it did more than two decades ago.The songs are great, with more logical twists and turns than anything McCartney ever put together other than side 2 of ABBEY ROAD. For a trio--including one novice keyboard player--this sounds like one top flight band.Macca seems to be at his best with his back against the wall--&quot;Hey Jude&quot; followed a somewhat stale period when, as Marianne Faithful put it in The Compleat Beatles, &quot;Everyone was wondering if the Beatles could do it again,&quot; and BAND ON THE RUN was made in the wake of the first collapse of Wings.Praised by the usual McCartney critics for giving them a heavier sound (on &quot;Jet,&quot; &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Hundred And Eighty Five&quot;), BAND ON THE RUN also boasts two of Macca's best acoustic numbers: &quot;Bluebird&quot; and &quot;Mamunia.&quot;But, for me, BAND ON THE RUN is at it's best on the quirkier tunes: &quot;Mrs. Vanderbilt,&quot; &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot; and &quot;Picasso's Last Words.&quot;This is a truly great LP--not as heavy as some critics always seem to clamor for--but great none the less. McCartney would never reach this level of sustained artistry again.As for the &quot;bonus CD&quot;....well, it was great for one listen. But there isn't a whole lot to warrent a second go-through.

THE JOSHUA TREE is U2's search for meaning in life and, more to the point, the struggle of the band's members to reconcile their strong religious belief with the life of the latter-day Rock stars they had become.Luckily for us they didn't fall into the trap of preaching or posing; they speak to other 30-somethings of their journey through the real world. At times that journey produces real gems--&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; &quot;With Or Without You,&quot; &quot;In God's Country,&quot;--and at other times it serves up nothing more than self-concious rubbish. like &quot;One Tree Hill.&quot;The hits are far more numerous, and far more powerful, than the misses on THE JOSHUA TREE. Not as opaque as THE UNGFORGETTABLE FIRE, nor as slip-shod as RATTLE &amp; HUM, THE JOSHUA TREE may be the best album from the best Rock band of the 1980s/1990s.

I loved Rod Stewart with Jeff Beck, I loved Rod Stewart with the Faces, and I loved the first decade or so of Rod Stewart's solo career.I love most of the songs on this LP, and I love the genre from which they were plucked.But this CD, like so much of what Rod Stewart has recorded over the past 15-20 years, is dissapointing to say the least. The man lost the edge to his voice before most of his new fans were even born, and has been sloffing from style to style since Reagan was President in search of something to call his own.Despite the wildly optimistic comments of some reviewers, Stewart does not do a particularly good rendition of a single song on this CD. To be perfectly blunt, IT HAD TO BE YOU sounds like nothing so much as your neighborhood party animal waxing sentimental on Karaoke night at the strip-mall pub.Nobody would like to see another great record from Rod Stewart more than I would but, much as I hate to say it, this (once again) is not it.

One of the greatest transformations in American Pop history is documented on TAPESTRY; after nearly a decade as a dowdy behind-the-scenes tunesmith working in near-anonimity in the Brill Building, this album (and the great cover photo) turned Carole King into an iconic Greenwich Village mother earth singer songwriter.And she hits the ball out of the park on both counts: her voice is like the girl next door, if the girl next door could drop her inhibitions and had perfect pitch; the tunes are exquisite, elegant; the combination is soulful, American, and classic.You've heard all the hits, and they were worthy of the charts, but don't miss her remake of the hit she wrote years earlier, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; It's a low-key way for King to point out how mature the lyrics to the early 60's Pop tune had been--it was easy to miss in the teenbeat, uptempo version that had hit the charts--and it is the true masterpiece of this great CD.

I am an American Beatles purist. So, to me, the REAL Beatles records will always be MEET THE BEATLES, BEATLES '65, HARD DAYS NIGHT, HELP, REVOLVER, RUBBER SOUL, SGT. PEPPER, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, WHITE ALBUM, ABBEY ROAD and LET IT BE. Everything else, including YELLOW SUBMARINE and the several collections of singles Capital slapped together are good--sometimes even great--records, but not the cream of the Beatles crop.That said, I have waited years for LET IT BE...NAKED, even having heard much of it in rough form on a whole series of bootlegs. It's #1 on Amazon this week, and will do about as well on the increasingly meaningless Billboard charts, I'm sure. It's been 33-1/3 years since the band imploded and they still rule the marketplace, but will FM radio play the record?Doubt it. I've always thought much of LET IT BE--&quot;Get Back,&quot; for example--is a unique belnd of Country and Hard Rock, and there is no outlet for that sound in 2003. That's too bad, because it's a great record.It's ironic that it took McCartney and more than three decades to finally release the record Lennon always claimed he wanted released, &quot;warts and all.&quot; That means there is little evidence of the studio sheen the Beatles mastered on PEPPER or ABBEY ROAD, and quite a bit of the rough edge they had in their Hamburg and Cavern days; just what McCartney, at least, had hoped they would rediscover when they were recording the original LET IT BE tapes.McCartney was smart enough to include &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; a great Lennon tune not on the original, and one of the most underrated of all Beatles tunes. While it may not have been thematically correct, I would have liked to have seen &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and one or two of the other singles relegated to the HEY JUDE LP show up here. The Beatles put out so many great songs between 1964 and 1970 that some real classics have fallen under the Pop world's radar.So, in the end, I think this is a fine record. Not a classic Beatles LP, but far better than 99 percent of the tripe currently being called Pop, and a real insight into both McCartney and Lennon's efforts in the Beatles last couple years together (by the way, while LET IT BE was the final true Beatles record released, it was NOT the final Beatles LP recorded. ABBEY ROAD was their final studio effort; it took so long to get Phil Spector to finish his work on LET IT BE, recorded prior to ABBEY ROAD, that LET IT BE was released after ABBEY ROAD and, in fact, after the band dissolved.)So buy LET IT BE...NAKED. It is what the best Rock and Roll/Pop band of all time sounded like on their lesser days, warts and all: Better Than Anybody Else.

As with every Spike Lee film--with the exception of the classic &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot;--&quot;Bamboozled&quot; shows signs of genius, but is fatally flawed by glaring splotches of amatuerish directoral decisions.In &quot;X&quot; it was the ridiculous insertion of an MGM-like, choreographed dance routine; in &quot;Bamboozled&quot; it is the unbelievably forced vocal styling of Damon Wayans. He doesn't sound &quot;white,&quot; which is I guess what Lee was looking for--he sounds like a poorly programmed robot, kind of like Teddy Ruxpin trying to imitate Boris Karloff. It's ridiculous, totally distracting, and it throws into the viewers face from start to finish that they are Watching A Movie. It is impossible to ignore it.Which is a shame, because otherwise &quot;Bamboozled&quot; would have been a very good, if not great, movie. Thanks to a great actor and a great subject, Lee was still able to turn &quot;X&quot; into a fantastic movie, despite the stupid dance scene. &quot;Bamboozled&quot; doesn't have that kind of impact, and the never-ending robotron dialogue kills it for me.

This is where I realized that Andy Partridge was more than just a quirky English recluse: he is the British Brian Wilson.Two magnificent albums, superbly orchestrated with sped up and slowed down tapes, layers of guitars and vocals, pianos spinning out of control, detuned guitars and and gongs and sonic booms from who knows where, all dripping from some of the wittiest lyrics this side of the Squeeze, and interspersed with an Alice In Wonderland-like story.Ya just gotta dig it.It's all genius, but if I had to pick highlights I'd go with &quot;The Mole From The Ministry&quot; and &quot;Brainiac's Daughter,&quot; which echo, without parodying, the very best of English Pop-Psychedelia, circa Sgt. Pepper/Magical Mystery Tour/early Pink Floyd.&quot;Brainiac's daughter talks like a Daily Planet reporter...&quot;This is the stuff you've been looking for.

It is simply inconcievable that any band could release an album so full of classic songs, stretching their creativity in so many musical directions simultaneously, include absolutely no clunkers whatsoever, make it appear to be an effortless production, and greatly expand what was already the largest fan base in musical history.Yet the Beatles did it all with REVOLVER. What's even more amazing is that they hadn't peaked yet.To truly grasp the times--the couple of dozen months when Rock &amp; Roll became Rock, hyperspacing from the 1950s to the 1960s--you need to sit down with a group of albums which took in everything around them and turned it into magic and, in the process, influenced each other to such a degree that they can almost be seen as seperate divisions of the same cultural army: the Beach Boys PET SOUNDS, Dylans HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE, and the Beatles killer triptic RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, and SGT PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.There are plenty of other good records out there, and even a few great ones from the same timeframe. But everything else begins with those six LPs.

There have been several versions of the Rolling Stones--The British Invasion Stones, The Fight The Power Stones, The Jet Set Stones, The Heroin Stones, The Disco Stones, The Aging Punk Stones, The Blues Stones, and the current version: The Tour On Bad Albums and No Hits Stones.Beggars Banquet is the Fight The Power Stones in full bloom.I am mystified by Jimmy Miller's production. On acoustic numbers like &quot;No Expectations,&quot; &quot;Dear Doctor,&quot; &quot;Factory Girl&quot; and &quot;Prodigal Son,&quot; he steps away and lets the performances speak for themselves. As a result they are great, great recordings.But his approach to the electric numbers, especially &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; and &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; is just baffling. &quot;Stray Cat Blues,&quot; which exists in masterpiece form on GET YER YA-YA'S OUT, is all muddied up here, with Jaggers vocal buried down in the mix, and &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; is virtually unlistenable.And what to say of &quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot;? The debate has always been about sincerity. Was Jagger, already a millionaire and only about 20 months removed from tax exile status, nodding to charity or poking a stick at it? Either way it's a great tune and, I think, Keiths first real vocal.I should say I'm not a typical Stones fan, by the way. For instance, I've never been much of a fan of &quot;Sympathy For The Devil,&quot; which I find kind of silly. Great backing vocal part, though.

Such a simple, childlike tale. The story it tells, though, is very adult, very dark--and, as eastern Europe and a lot of the rest of the world could testify, it hits the truth dead center.By the way--am I the only one who finds dramatic similarities between ANIMAL FARM and the Who's &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again?&quot;

I love XTC, but I have to say this LP is a bit spotty."Respectable Street" is one of the best unknown singles of all time, and there's a lot of other good stuff here too. I've always liked "Ten Feet Tall," "Take This Town," and "Scissor Man," for instance.But how do you put together a compilation album, with access to all their tapes, and include junk like "Looking For Footprints"? It's well played, because XTC were such a tight bunch at that point, but it's more than dull--it's a downright annoying recording.Buy the better XTC records: BLACK SUN, ENGLISH SETTLEMENT, ORANGES & LEMONS, etc.. If you find you love the band, come back to RAG & BONE BUFFET. But don't let this CD be your first XTC experience.

OK, it'll never take the place of Dylan Thomas poetry or a John Irving novel. But the AP Press Guide is an indisputable tool or the writing you do on the job--newswriting--and it is what it is.You should have more than one guide, including some kind of in-house directions, sitting on your shelf.

The thrill of DOUBLE FANTASY is the exchange between Lennon and Ono and, despite the comments of some rather short-sighted critics, Ono's work on this CD is on at least an equal footing with Lennon's.Ono's work here is, in fact, much more inventive than Lennon's, and that just plays into the DOUBLE FANTASY concept. The point of Lennon's later work, his Yoko-related art, was not that they were identical twins or that he was the dominant partner in their relationship. The point was that they were two pieces of the same whole, ying and yang--Yoko was, as he says on &quot;Woman,&quot; &quot;the other half of the sky.&quot;Lennon's work here is fine, but it's hardly pushing any envelopes. It is traditional Pop--&quot;Starting Over&quot; uses the oldest chord progression in the book--and has more to do with telling a story than musical inovation. It's good stuff, and Lennon's voice is particularly good here, but an entire album of this would have come dangerously close to the mundane standard set by his post-IMAGINE LPs.So, listen with open ears to Yoko on &quot;Kiss Kiss Kiss,&quot; &quot;Yes I'm Your Angel,&quot; &quot;Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him,&quot; and the magnificent &quot;Walking On Thin Ice,&quot; now included on this extended CD, and you'll hear an artist who finally learned how to make great Pop songs on DOUBLE FANTASY.

The great overlooked Woody Allen comedy. There are a million great silly one-liners in this film (&quot;They offend my sensibilities! Get them off the ship!&quot;...&quot;I don't know why, but you got a better bandage than me!&quot;...&quot;Everybody shows up when we have girls to tie up&quot;). The plot is secondary, but who cares, this film is a riot released years ahead of its time.

A beautiful record, DECEMBER has, unfortunately, been labeled &quot;New Age&quot; by fans and critics alike.That term has more to do with Winston's label-mates than the music on DECEMBER. This is just plain old piano solos, played with a wonderful touch and sensitivity. It isn't really the holiday season until you hear DECEMBER.

This was the first Ramones album--maybe the first punk album--that I ever bought, and I can still remember how it FUZZED MY BRAIN.After three years of Top-40 radio dominated by the likes of Andy Gibb, Seals & Crofts and Steely Dan, LEAVE HOME was more than a breath of fresh air, it was a tornado. Within six months of hearing this LP I was a complete convert, wearing torn jeans, playing nothing but barre chords, and hunting down the Sex Pistols, Clash, Ramones, etc. LPs that were then generally available only as imports.Punk was very quickly turned into some quirky American marketing scheme--I'm thinking about Blondie, the Talking Heads and the Romantics here--but with a few short gliches (END OF THE CENTURY, for example) the Ramones remained true. They were one of the very few who found a connection between punk and traditional rock--"Pinhead" and "California Sun" sound just fine side by side, for instance--so I guess they didn't see much reason to fool with the formula.And they were great fun. "Carbona Not Glue" and "Beat On The Brat" are a laugh, not the misanthropic mess they would have been in lesser hands. You can not keep your head from bangin' when listening to the Ramones.Joey Ramone may be the most underrated singer in rock history. A lot of intitial critical reaction to the Ramones focused on the relentless bass/rythm guitar attack; to me it had as much to do with Joey's vocals as anything else. Could he hit high notes with George Michael? No. Would he want to? No. Joey Ramone put across NY swagger like nobody's business, and David Johanson would have given his eye teeth to sing like Joey.Ramones LPs been called audio comic books, and to a large extent that's true. On the other hand, they were the only rockers I recall who had the guts to release a record about the absurdity of Ronald Reagan's embrace of the Third Reich, "Bonzo Goes To Bitburg." It was one of the last times Rock was actually important, I think, and it's also a great single; track it down.Back when I was full-bore into the scene, I thought ROCKET TO RUSSIA was the best Ramones LP. Looking back, I think ROCKET was simply more accessible to a boy raised on melody; it also had a better cover photo and some of the 'professional' sound I was accustomed to. Today I see LEAVE HOME as the best Ramones LP, bar none. There are at least 7 classic Ramones songs here.Adding the Roxy show makes this great LP a great double LP. Unlike some other live Ramones releases, this catches the band at their energetic peak--August, 1976. Joey's patter between tunes is the greatest.

There is nothing "campy" about this movie, it just STINKS.Only Robert Stigwood could take the greatest, most important album of the 1960s and turn it into the worst movie of all time.It was an embarassment to everyone involved. The Bee Gees refused to comment about SGT. PEPPER in interviews during the 1980's and Billy Preston filed a lawsuit to have his name removed from the video box. It wasn't just a bad movie, it killed careers.When I saw it in the theater with several friends during it's very short-lived general release, I was appalled at the movie's amauterishness. There is no plot, the dialogue would insult the intelligence of a typical 4th grader, and the acting is non-existent. The music is performed in some kind of mind-numbing daze with orchestration straight out of H.R. Puffenstuff.Towards the end of the film Peter Frampton stands on a roof top contemplating suicide. In the theater two or three people, myself included, began shouting "Jump! Jump!"It was the only time I've ever been in a movie theater when the audience booed as the final credits rolled.There are a few short seconds while Aerosmith performs "Come Together" that are kind of interesting. But all of the rest of the movie should have been torn to shreds, burned, and buried in a pit on the dark side of the moon. It is absolute unadulterated GARBAGE.I rank it 1 star because that's as low as the rating system goes. In reality it deserves negative 46 stars.

Before Sting fell in love with vapid pseudo-jazz, before Pop reverted to thinly-disguised disco, before Metal collapsed into shred, before American radio completely abandoned Rock...Synchronicity! A great album from a nearly great band. Sting was a fine writer before his ego got too bloated, this album is the proof. He ended up leaving it all behind to make John Tesh-like albums of aural wallpaper, but I still put this CD on and can forget his lamer moments.

Carly Simon was famous before her songs were done to death in cracker commercials and soundtracks to chick flicks. She was, in fact, tough as nails on pop, top-40 radio. White suburbia's Laura Nyro, if you will.If you think you aren't familiar with her best stuff, check out the samples here. You'll recognize most of them. Along with Carol King, Simon dominated radio play for a couple of years, putting out a series of sparkling piano-based singles that told stories from a side of the coin pop hadn't heard in a while.She could do anything for a while. I mean, who would have said &quot;Mockingbird&quot; would be a hit?While I think this is a great album--the first 6 titles are all minor classics of American pop--it's &quot;You're So Vain&quot; that will always make Carly Simons reputation.What a perfect, perfect single. Mixed like a Lennon record, with those throaty Carly vocals and a nasty lyric (&quot;You gave away the things you loved and one of them was me,&quot;) that sent everybody on edge when it was released. For a time, there was a real debate about the focus of the title: Warren Beatty? James Taylor? Mick Jagger? I think the final consensus was Beatty; Jagger sings backing vocals on the track.That's how big she was: Mick Jagger was a hired backup singer on her records.&quot;You're So Vain&quot; sits in my alltime top-10, and the rest of this album is a study in Pop. Get it.

Without any doubt, Elton John was the greatest Pop Star during the period between the Beatles and Madonna, a period covering all of the 1970s and a chunk of the 1980s--and he makes regular appearances on the charts to this day.His first GREATEST HITS package covers his earliest and most prolific days. Elton put out several LPs a year during the early/mid 1970s, and they were all gems. Picking out a "Best Of" package would have required at least 3 discs, so MCA opted for a "Greatest Hits" thing instead.There isn't a weak track on this LP. Personally I'll always have a soft spot for "Crocodile Rock" and "Your Song," but I wouldn't get rid of anything here. Like the Beatles, Elton knows how to put across rockers and ballads, is open to new instrumentation and rhythms, and knows how to write a hook.I think the Elton influence on my generation has somehow been overlooked, even after the millions of albums and singles he sold. Lennon & Bowie thought he was great in the 70s, lesser pop stars (like George Michael and Boy George) thought he was great in the 80s. He has become an icon.And, when I was 14 or 15, Valerie Bertinelli had Elton's poster on her bedroom wall on "One Day At A Time." If there is a man my age who claims they didn't take notice of that, that man is a liar.

Apparently the script, sound equipment and several cameras were lost on the way to the set of this dull film.I imagine the director telling his actors: &quot;More mumbling--more mumbling! I nearly understood some of the dialogue in the last take!&quot; Then he turned to his cameraman and told him to slop another jar of vaseline on the lens.I could put up with some of the pretentious art-school escapades of this movie if the story was worth following, but there IS no story. A bunch of LA people with direct and tangenital ties to the entertainment business wander along for two hours--that's the story. Woopee.The one and only redeeming thing in this meandering piece of junk is the veterinarian who comes to check out David Hyde Pierce's sick dog and sticks around to eat hash brownies. I don't know who the actress is, but she is a breath of fresh air in the midst of this smelly waste of time.

Arguably the best 'Greatest Hits/Best Of' package ever, LEGEND presents the American radio version of Marley, with much of his revolutionary ferver and virtually all of his religious thesis stripped away, leaving an incomplete picture of the man while delivering a ton of great music.Island Records even had the brains to include the classic live version of &quot;No Woman No Cry,&quot; from the LIVE! album, instead of the studio version. This is, for my money, the greatest of all Marley recordings, from one of the best ever live LPs. The live version of &quot;Get Up Stand Up&quot; would have made more sense than the studio version too.I like some of the lesser-known tunes here so much. &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; and &quot;Waiting In Vain,&quot; &quot;Satisfy My Soul&quot; fill out this great, great LP with another side of the man's music, one not often heard on American radio.And, of course, you get the dance-floor favorites that made Marley's fame in America--&quot;Could You Be Loved,&quot; &quot;Stir It Up&quot; and &quot;Jamming.&quot;Marley was never as big in the States as he deserved to be; he was venerated as a political, musical and even religious figure throughout much of the third world. This album, along with LIVE!, demonstrates that the US missed the boat on the musical piece of the puzzle.

George C. Scott is really good, but here's the simple secret to PATTON's greatness: the writer.The screenplay, including that thundering monologue at the open and all the dreamy stuff about ancient Rome and the Carthaginians, was written by Francis Ford Coppola, the genius behind THE GODFATHER, APOCOLYPSE NOW, and others.

What a wonderful surprise O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is. I had little interest in seeing the film--the marketing was bland, to say the least--but am now completely obsessed with it.There are a few awkward moments in the film, including virtually all of the Pretty Boy Floyd stuff, but the performances of Clooney, turturro and Nelson more than make up for those small problems. Clooney, in particular, is wonderful from start to finish.

GOODFELLAS is fantastic, kind of like THE GODFATHER with the veneer stripped off to reveal what the modern mafia is really all about.The performances are flawless--I wish Deniro had been on screen more, because he is just so fantastic in this part--and the script, while not something you'd want to read to your mother, is great. The direction is superb--the long tracking shot, following Henry Hill from his car, threw the kitchen, and to his table at a nightclub, is amazing.But I wish Scorsese had found a way to pick up the pace o the last 30 minutes. Once Henry goes into the witness protection program, the film flags a bit.

Generally considered the band's first 'soft' step, LED ZEPPELIN III is, in fact, a pretty 'hard' LP. &quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; &quot;Celebration Day,&quot; &quot;Since I've Been Loving You,&quot; and &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot; are pretty heavy stuff--not exactly Fairport Convention.But Page was beginning to give Plant, he of the golden locks and hippy-dippy love songs, a bigger voice on Zeppelin records. The results were some of Led Zeppelin's finest moments: records with hard edges, soft mushy centers, and that big whompin' John Bonham core.And, if all else failed, Page would lay down another stunning guitar solo, as he does on &quot;Tangerine,&quot; a premonition of the sound the band would perfect on it's masterpiece, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI, a few years later.III is a transition piece, but a very good one, with several magical moments.

Jimmy Page, as a Producer of 1970s metal, was simply invincible. This album is as close to a perfect metal record as you will ever hear.From the opening scratches of Page's Les Paul strings, through the soaring &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; (with a personal favorite of mine, Sandy Denny, on vocals) and the thundering &quot;When The Levee Breaks,&quot; this is a creative and sonic masterpiece, the likes of which wanna-be's like Kiss, Motley Crue, and a thousand others have never even vaguely approached.There is, of course, &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; which 1970s and '80s FM radio did its very best to kill by playing it 8 times an hour for 20 years straight. Trouble is it's so damn good--true delicacy on the acoustic intro, true throbbing rock in the middle, and true artistry, intensity and vision on the guitar solo--that it lives on.I once read that Jimmy Page said somewhere he wrote the complex &quot;Black Dog,&quot; and then overdubbed so many guitars on its recording, specifically because he was sick and tired of hearing every bar band in the world do lousy versions of Led Zep songs from their first 3 LPs, so he tried to create a record that second rate bands couldn't cover.It worked. Nobody can touch this LP--including Page, who could never recreate the beauty of the &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; guitar solo on stage.

Generally dismissed by critics, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR actually has several great moments, among them the glittering entrance of Page's lead guitar on &quot;In The Evening,&quot; and the drifting instrumental break a few moments later. Plant's throaty vocals on &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; are pretty amazing, and the throb of &quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; is pretty hard to ignore too.The only really sour passage here is &quot;Fool In The Rain,&quot; one of the most annoying songs ever recorded by a great band.But, when set in the context of &quot;All My Love&quot; and &quot;Carouselambra,&quot; it's only a small drop of annoyance in a larger pool of good. IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR is not the typical Led Zeppelin record, but it isn't nearly as bad as critics would have you believe.

The first 5 minutes of MANHATTAN--Gershwin over NYC snapshots--is some of the most gorgeous cinema you'll ever see. The fact that it's black and white doesn't take away from that beauty; in Woody Allen's hands, B&W; actually adds to the beauty.Allen displays New York at its cosmopolitan height, even as the city was crumbling around him. He glories in its aging beauty, its earthy, crusty patina, its diversity and the grandeur of Manhattan and its people. Those short-sighted reviewers who choose to grade the movie based on their opinion of Allen's personal life--which they have gleened from the pages of the Weekly World News and Parade magazine--are not only missing the point of this film, they are flying in the face of the compassion and love of humanity which it evokes.Of course, that may be the way Allen would handle it if the situation were reversed. He is the personification of the old line--is it from Socrates or vaudeville?--"I love humanity; it's people I can't stand."The story isn't as approachable as Annie Hall, and the characters aren't as warm, but MANHATTAN is still Allen at his creative peak. New York has never looked better.

It's Memorial Day, 2001, and I'm getting ready to drive over to the local 'burg to cover the ceremonies for the paper. I'm sure I'll see flags flying, a few vets from World War II and Korea, a few Gulf War vets, and a handful of Vietnam Vets.And I'm willing to bet, I'll hear &quot;Born In The USA&quot; blasting from more than a few car stereos. Because, for all the nauseating co-opting of this music by Ronald Reagan and others, that is who this album was really directed at, and that's who really understood it the best: mid-life baby boomers who were in the war or were of that age. Springsteen, like Townshend before him, understood his audience, his generation, and he spoke to them first and foremost.Ignore the claims of the Right and the Left that this is some kind of endorsement or a political party or dogma. This may be an album with a political tilt, but that tilt is towards people--people caught in the war, caught out of work, caught in jail--and tilted away from parties and campaigns and endorsements. The song &quot;Born In The USA&quot; doesn't say the war was right, it doesn't say the war was wrong. It just says the war was holy hell on the people who went to fight it, and it was holy hell on their families.I think BORN IN THE USA acknowledges the divisions in America, and nostalgizes the character's &quot;Glory Days&quot; only to point out the character's growing disconnect from society. They all feel that they were part of something bigger--a family, a team, a friendship, a platoon, a job--but now they don't have that connection. Springsteen said, when talking about NEBRASKA, that isolation was the most dangerous thing in the world. BORN IN THE USA is full of characters who understand that, and worry that they are becoming isolated.To me, the heart of this LP is &quot;Bobby Jean,&quot; a song Springsteen wrote for Little Stevie, who left the band during BORN IN THE USA:&quot;In some motel room there'll be a radio playing, and you'll here me sing this song. Well, if you do, you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between, and I'm just calling one last time, not to change your mind, but just to say I miss you, baby. Good luck. Good bye.&quot;It's more than just Springsteen's farewell to a former bandmate--it's Springsteen joining in that nostalgic farewell his characters are going through on the LP.Vets--Vietnam Vets in particular--talk about being frozen in time, stuck at 18. They say the war is never far from them, and the friends they lost are always on their mind. Springsteen and BORN IN THE USA appealed to them, I think, because the album doesn't make judgements; it simply observes that life's hard times, life's good times, and everyone you meet along the way stay with you, effect you, become you.And, in the end, on &quot;My Hometown,&quot; the singer looks around him. He shows his son where all the good and bad took place. He tells him to remember it all.And then he tells him that they're leaving. The kids who fought to get out of town on BORN TO RUN are finally leaving town on BORN IN THE USA, but it's not with the same hope they had then.

This is a record everyone should own; it is fun and melodic, inventive, creative, and gives you that good audio buzz you got the first time you heard the Beatles, the Replacements, U2, or XTC.Not that Wilco sounds like any of those bands--well, OK, maybe more than a tad like the 'Mats--but the same kind of Pop genius is at work here. Tweedy may lean C&amp;W, but he understands Pop. There are touches of both BLONDE ON BLONDE and DESIRE-era Dylan, the Dead, the Byrds and the Band too. It's an amazing amalgom of styles boiled down into something original and new, purely Wilco.I'd paid little attention to Wilco prior to YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT because of what I still see as an overriding pretention in most Alt-Country. Tweedy sets all that aside here with a dose of close to the bone lyrics, McCartneyesque melodies, breathy vocals, and off-kilter instrumentation that I find absolutely absorbing.This is a classic LP that most people will never hear because--here comes my constant complaint--American radio programmers are deaf to all but boy-bands, repititious rap, and hat-band country dullerdry.Buy this record and remind yourself how great Pop can be.

LED ZEPPELIN II is thE album that convinced at least one generation of teenage boys that they could play the electric guitar. Years later we all realized that we were operating on a different planet than Jimmy Page.These are riffs that thunder along, but they also have some swing. Black Sabbath and Deep Purple never quite figured out that the secret to Led Zeppelin was that they weren't just out to make you bang your head; they could make you swing your hips as well.LED ZEPPELIN II wasn't the artistic peak for the band. That was still several years away. But it was the last time Page would give his fans an all-out heavy metal guitar attack for a while. The band's next two LPs--III and IV, oddly enough--would find Page adding layers and textures to the bands big sound.

The Office is to sitcoms what The Sopranos has been to television dramas: a redefinition of the genre, and one that makes all others in their category seem second rate by comparison.Ricky Gervais has perfectly captured the absurdities of office life and filled his characters with real personality. Only a few are less than three dimensional--Chris Finch and Lee come to mind--but the rest are all human. Tim is a witty but wimpy lonely heart, Gareth an arrogant but vulnerable pain in the rear, Dawn a needy user--even David Brent, the manager/standup comedian who rumbles from one awkward conversation to the next, has enough humanity that you can feel sorry for him in all but his most asinine moments.The first season of The Office was the greatest inaugural season in sitcom history.Get it while you can, though: episodes of the second season aired on the BBC have been more angry and cruel--and less funny--and Ricky Gervais has said from the start there will be no third season.

With most bands if there is a difference between their live sound and their studio sound, the recorded version is better. Not so with the Raveonettes. The production on this album is absolutely awful.Everything is slighlty distorted and flat--somehow producers Richard Gottehrer and Sune Rose Wagner have managed to record the band in stereo while retaining all of the shortcomings of mono, and have gained none of the warmth of mono in the process. There is a grating metallic screech dropped into some songs and in the breaks between others that sounds more like a circular saw than music; I get a headache everytime I listen to this CD.(By the way, I hear little similarity between &quot;Chain Gang of Love&quot; and Jesus &amp; Mary Chain--sounds more like Exene Cervanka and X to me.)The songs are OK, but they all sound pretty similar. Heard one and you've heard 'em all. &quot;The Truth About Johnny,&quot; is OK, and &quot;Untamed Girls&quot; is actually really good, but the rest of the tunes are kind of dull.See the Raveonettes live.

The fact that this is the only Blasters CD available shows how lame the American Music scene can get. Their live EP from a tour of the UK is just about the greatest live rock ever recorded (right up there with Live At Leeds and Get Yer Ya-Yas Out). The first few Blasters LPs were masterful--and they had to fight to get those released. They were hotter than hot live, and classy studio stuff too.Hunt down ALL Blasters LPs. This I command you.

One of the 3 greatest live Rock LPs ever recorded (along with the Stones GET YER YA-YA'S OUT and Bob Marley's LIVE), LIVE AT LEEDS is extended but not quite improved by the addition of several tracks and some resequencing.Still, it is the greatest quitar workout you're ever going to hear. Townshend is lyrical, powerful, rockin', and even a bit soulful--all within the same tune. His guitar work flies in every direction without ever seeming out of control. &quot;My Generation&quot; is far different from the 2 minute 30 power version; here it incorporates much of Townshends riff-output from '68-'70.You gotta have it.

Wha' Happened?!?Kill Bill Vol. 1 was SUCH a great film; action-packed, thrilling, inventive, sexy and funny.Kill Bill Vol. 2, on the other hand, is a bore. Tedious and childish. From the first few seconds, when Uma overacts a monologue rehashing of Vol. 1, through two dull but bloody hours right up until David Carradine's half-asleep pseudo-philosophical ramblings, there is nothing of real interest here.What a let down.

I bought this compilation (read my other reviews for my many lengthy and annoying diatribes against "Best Of" and "Greatest Hits" packages) only because I wanted to get a CD copy of Martha & The Muffins best album, THIS IS THE ICE AGE, and it is sadly out of print.Like way too many compilations you have to wade through an unruly amount of mediocre filler to get to the good stuff. For my money "Echo Beach" and the few tunes pulled from THIS IS THE ICE AGE are far and away the best stuff on this CD; there are at least three other tunes from THIS IS THE ICE AGE that should have been included.Oddly enough I've always thought the bands best tune was "Swimming," which is sung not by Martha Johnson, but by Mark Gane (doing his best Brian Eno imitation vocal & guitar, by the way). I used to play this song over and over and over on my then-girlfriend's car cassette player on the way to clubs in DC back when this record--and the world in general--was new.When Martha & The Muffins dip into social commentary--i.e., "Women Around The World At Work" and "Black Stations/White Stations"--I lose interest real fast. But when they shed their white-bread art college pretentions and play some of their quirkier stuff--"You Sold The Cottage," "Swimming," "Echo Beach," "Cooling The Medium"--they are fun in that 1980's 'we're such serious fun' kind of way.Release THIS IS THE ICE AGE!!!

What is demonstrated most clearly in HEAT is the different directions taken by De Niro and Pacino in the 20+ years since they were young actors in THE GODFATHER and THE GODGFATHER PART II.Pacino, who was such a thrill to watch in his early days, is now almost unbearable. He's lost any sense of subtlety or depth. In THE GODFATHER there was a quiet rage, an anger and intensity that bubbled just under his surface that was just amazing to watch. Now he just screams every line. In HEAT he cackles and yells in every scene, hollering at traffic, hollering at his wife, hollering at De Niro, hollering out his breakfast order...it just never stops. 'Round about SCARFACE Pacino stopped being an actor--and he'd been a great one up until that point--and started being a very bad caricature of himself. I call it the Marty Scheen syndrome.De Niro, on the other hand, was already great at GODFATHER PART II, and has spent his time since then perfecting his craft. He's become the best actor of his generation, (unless you put Jack Nicholson in the same generation, and then it's a tie), an actor who can do action, thrillers, comedy--whatever. He is the best.As for the film itself, I'm not as taken with it as many others seem to be. It's a good action flick, but I wouldn't put DIE HARD in the same category as APOCOLYPSE NOW, if you get my drift. HEAT is good at what it tries to do, but I don't know that it tries to do very much.All this talk of &quot;dissecting the psychology&quot; of a cop and a criminal, finding out they're not that different, yadda yadda yadda--what a load of whooey. The conversation De Niro and Pacino have over a cup of coffee, which could have been a great set piece for both their careers and a moment movie fans would be able to recall like Bogie getting drunk in CASABLANCA or Brando emerging from the darkness in APOCOLYPSE NOW, is tedious and contrived. Pacino appears to make several blundering ad-libs, and you wouldn't be surprised to see De Niro come out of character long enough to ask him what the heck he's doing.And Val Kilmer's part is virtually non-existent. Kilmer is a hit or miss actor--he hit on all cylinders in TOMBSTONE, missed on all in BATMAN--and this is mostly a miss.

The 1972 follow-up to &quot;Let's Stay Together,&quot; &quot;I'm Still In Love With You&quot; loses some of the chunky-chugga-chugga sound of the 1971 record, presenting a slightly sweeter, more personal sound, and still has the thick groove I love about Al Green's music.&quot;Simply Beautiful&quot; is a masterpiece, a stripped-down Green sound not found on many of his records.It's difficult to find fault with any Al Green record. He was at a creative peak in 1971-1972. And he has the sweetest voice in Soul.

An oddly disapointing album, PAUL IS LIVE sounds good enough, but is emotionally unsatisfying.The performances are OK, but it feels as if a group of studio musicians are just running through a nights work. Oops--here's why--that's exactly what PAUL IS LIVE is!Macca has some trouble with the high notes, so you spend way too much time listening to Hamish Stuart's vocals. Rumor has it none of the Beatles were named &quot;Hamish.&quot;A decent LP, but not all that memorable. For the real deal, track down a copy of the classic live album WINGS OVER AMERICA.

These are all great tracks, but you should already have copies of THE CLASH, GIVE'EM ENOUGH ROPE, LONDON CALLING, and SANDINISTA, which would give you most of this compilation already.On the other hand, it gives you a CD version of &quot;This Is Radio Clash,&quot; one of the great overlooked singles of all time. Apocolyptic may be too gentle a term for this single, which unnerved the punk scene when it was released on 12-inch in 1981. Clown time, as Elvis liked to say, was over.

For all the talk of ZOSO and &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, it is PHYSICAL GRAFFITI that ranks as Led Zeppelin's most complete masterpiece, more accurately showcasing all of the band's strengths.The rockers throb and ache, and the accoustic numbers float with the kind of magic Page always strove for. This is a double album that leaves you wanting more.The first disc--&quot;Custard Pie,&quot; &quot;The Rover,&quot; &quot;In My Time Of Dying,&quot; &quot;Houses Of The Holy,&quot; &quot;Trampled Under Foot,&quot; and the epic &quot;Kashmir,&quot;--may be the greatest series of tunes ever assembled on a hard Rock or metal LP. The songs are great, the performances inspired and flawless, and Jimmy Page's production, as always, is perfection.On the second disc, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; aches and groans, with a masterful vocal from Robert Plant and one of the best-ever guitar solos from Page.&quot;Down By The Seaside&quot; starts as some kind of homage to hometown life, the idyllic village by the sea. But there's something there that gets under Plant's skin--&quot;people turned away-see how they run?&quot;--and it lets loose the only time on a Led Zep record where Plant, the flower-child love-child pie-in-the-sky peacenik--sounds really angry, pointing his finger at, I suppose, those holier-tha-thou critics who constantly harped on Zep's supposed failure to acknowledge it's influences: &quot;Do you still do the twist--do you find you remember things that well? I wanna tell you, some folks' twisting every day, though sometimes it's hard to tell...&quot;Well, that might be a stretch. No matter. PHYSICAL GRAFFITI is the essence of Led Zeppelin. If you own no other record by these masters of hard Rock, own this one.

The real tip-off that this is a great compilation, in which somebody who really understood the early Stones invested a lot of time, thought and smarts, is the inclusion of the GET YER YA-YA'S OUT version of &quot;Midnight Rambler,&quot; the most raucus and intimidating Stones recording of all time. If it had been left up to the usual suits, only studio versions would have been included, and &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; would have been left behind entirely. Listen to the crowd's response to the band's thunder in the slow, middle section----expletives shouted in ecstasy.HOT ROCKS is the Stones LP to grab for your intro to the group, it's also a fine record to throw on the system for a long stretch of uninterupted great Rock &amp; Roll.

This album of recordings the Stone's didn't feel were good enough to release in the 60s and early 70s, released against their wishes in 1975, does more to prove their greatness than they ever could have imagined.Because this is classic, classic stuff. It sounds like the Stones' Motown record: "Out of Time" is amazing, and the rest of the album, with a few minor exceptions, is a fine reminder of what great Rock & Roll was once all about.I foolishly bought this CD and a newer Stones record, the live NO SECURITY, from 1998, on the same day. What an eye opening experience. METAMORPHASIS was supposed to be a throw-away to fulfill a dying contract, while NO SECURITY was designed as a big, live, 'come back' record following an extensive tour. But there's more rockin' in "Don't Lie To Me," a virtually forgotten tune on side one of METAMORPHASIS, than on all of the newer live record combined. METAMORPHASIS is playing on my stereo right now; NO SECURITY is in the trash can.They were a great band--for a stretch they were living up to their 'Greatest Rock and Roll Band On Earth' label--and now a shadow image of the old kings tours endlessly, slowly getting worse and worse in old age.The version of "Heart of Stone" isn't the classic version released on 45--those were the little records singles came out on in the stone age, teeny boppers--and a lot of this stuff sounds different than most classic Stones LPs. More American, to tell the truth--there are obvious Motown and even Beach Boys influences running through this record and, in the second half, the sounds of EXILE ON MAIN STREET and BEGGAR'S BANQUET begin to creep in.It's a great, great record that far too few people have heard.

ANTHOLOGY 2 focuses on the creative process of Pop's most creative band during their most creative period.For those who don't &quot;get&quot; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;--who think it's just a weird record--this CD should be an educational experience. Several different demo versions of the tune show Lennon struggling to find the right accompaniment to his most complex melody. Lennon knew he was onto something but, as he would with &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; the next year, he couldn't communicate to George Martin precisely what he was hearing in his head. The final &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; remains the most difficult Beatles record, and also one of their best.McCartney, on the other hand, just pops off &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; the flipside of &quot;Strawberry Fields,&quot; and an equally great record. His voice isn't as pure here as on the single version, and the high French Horn hasn't been added to the mix, but it is still a sterling Pop record.It is, I think, poetic justice that Lennon and McCartney each wrote and recorded their greatest Beatles single, both based on fond childhood memories, within days of each other, and had them released as a back-to-back A-Side single. &quot;Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane&quot; is the Beatles crowning achievement, showing both sides of their one-in-a-billion genious and creativity.

The Beatlemania phase of the anthology also contains &quot;Free As A Bird,&quot; which, if nothing else, proved that the Beatles (or at least the production crew at the modern-day Apple) can add videos to the laundry list of things they do better than anybody else.Already included on the list: Singles, albums, drum solos, close harmonies, Pop song writing, Popstar movies, personal fashion, grotty nude photography, and kazoo solos.Beatle collecters already have a lot of these recordings on their shelves in bootlegs, but I'm glad to have clean, sanctioned CD versions of &quot;Sheik Of Araby&quot; and &quot;Cry For A Shadow,&quot; among others, available here.What is most interesting to note is the sudden shift in energy (not tempo, which so many young bands mistake for energy) between the first 23 tracks and everything that comes after that. Beginning with &quot;Please Please Me&quot; the Beatles turn some corner, and everything is different from there on out.And for Americans like me who realize that we got 95% of the Beatles greatness but still hunger for the 5% that was only available to UK audiences prior to Ed Sullivan, check out tracks 30-34. Anybody who wants to downplay the Beatles early stuff as bubblegum will have to admit that this was a band that cooked, just cooked.Lennon said &quot;What we generated was fantastic when we played straight rock, and there was nobody to touch us in Britain.&quot; I can't think of anybody in the States who was playing like this in '62 or '63 either.

Keep in mind, if you're a fan of the 1970's/1980's hard rock Who, that they were a very different band before the 1967 release of Tommy. They were a singles-oriented British R&amp;B outfit, not the concept-album heavies of later years.Not that I have a complaint about either version of the Who. The series of singles they released leading up to Tommy, including Can't Explain, Substitute, My Generation, Anyway Anyhow Anywhere, I'm A Boy, etc., is one of the greatest runs any band has ever had--check out MEATY BEATY BIG AND BOUNCY. And the 8 or 10 years following Tommy, including the albums Live At Leeds, Quadrophenia, Who's Next, Who By Numbers, and Townshend's early solo stuff, saw some of the most influential and powerful rock ever recorded from the Quintessential Rock band.So, I recommend this album highly, even though I have to laugh every time I hear Daltrey trying to do James Brown on Please, Please, Please. This CD is what a good dance LP was before Madonna convinced everybody that casio keyboards and programmed drum synths were soulful.

Here's an album that reaches highs and lows so wildly opposing as to make any straight-thru listening difficult at best.&quot;America&quot; is one of the true classics of the 1960s, as is &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; (I give some of the credit to Dustin Hoffman, but &quot;America,&quot; at least, could have stood on its own). &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter,&quot; while not my cup of tea, shows off that Paul Simon world-weariness, for which he leans way too heavy on Dylan Thomas, that has always been big among 20-something pseudo-artists. And I've always had a spot for &quot;At The Zoo,&quot; &quot;Fakin' It,&quot; and the haunting &quot;Bookends.&quot;But the lows on this LP--&quot;Save The Life of My Child,&quot; &quot;Overs,&quot; &quot;Punky's Dilemma&quot; and, worst of all, &quot;Voices of The Old People,&quot; are just dreck. Simon was always too willing to go cutesy--I sight &quot;Feelin' Groovy,&quot; quite possibly the worst post-Beatles hit on the pop charts--and the self-satisfaction on this LP is too hard to stomach.Simon &amp; Garfunkel made some great, great records, but LPs were decidedly NOT their forum. They were a greatest hits package waiting to happen.

I love the tracks on this CD, but the running time--9 minutes, 9 seconds, total--is a bad joke.CDs can safely run 70 minutes of music. The only reason I can see that this CD is cut criminally short is to put other tracks on a seperate CD come holiday shopping time."Ripped Pants" and "F.U.N. Song" are great, and you can't help but like the SBSP themesong.But the Pantera tune, in addition to being completely out of place, is absolute garbage. This is a band without an audience, and both my kids and I roll our eyes and hit the "skip" button whenever this klunker comes out of the speakers. My advice for future compilations would be to include the popular tunes that the characters actually sing, and leave the compilers favorite schlock tunes in their own cassette players, where they belong.My kids and I love Sponge Bob, but this is [not a good deal].

The best Dylan album, ever, with the possible exception of BLONDE ON BLONDE.It's more than the best-known cuts: &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;Desolation Row,&quot; and &quot;Highway 61 Revisited.&quot; This is wall-to-wall greatness, from the frenzy of &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; to the snear of &quot;Ballad Of A Thin Man,&quot; to the stroll of &quot;It Takes A Lot To Laugh...&quot; to the world-weariness of the superb &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blue,&quot; Dylan was hitting on all cylinders. Al Kooper and the rest of this backing band were just what these tunes called for: loose, but on always on target.By the way...what's that in Dylan's right hand on the cover?

Every blockhead who ever sang in a Rock band thinks he can sing just like Robert Plant. I did it, you did it, every suburban guy in North America did it at one time or another.The difference between us and The Darkness is that they managed to get some MTV pals to play their videos.Because, when you get right down to it, Justin Hawkins CAN NOT SING. If you've ever heard Howard Stern do his horrible rendition of Led Zep's &quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; you know it is incredibly funny--and you know he sings as good (and bad) as Hawkins.This record, and The Darkness's 15 minutes of fame, will be remembered as this generation's &quot;Disco Duck.&quot;

Remember how great Patti Smith was before she decided she was a beat poet--back when she wrote actual songs, that were played on actual guitars, by actual rock and roll musicians?Well, throw in a better sense of melody and the ability to hold it all together over the course of a CD, and that's the closest approxiamation I can come up with for PJ Harvey.The woman who wrote &quot;Sheila Na Gig&quot; and then pummeled college radio with it--one of the few true rock records of the last 10 years--does so much on each song on this CD. &quot;One Line&quot; and &quot;Kamikazi&quot; are my personal faves, but the whole thing shakes, sometimes like a bad dream, sometimes like a roller coaster.PJ is what a lot of lesser acts--and even a few great ones, like U2 and latter-day Pretenders--try to be. She's brave and sexy and funny and smart and has more to do with rock than Blur or Oasis or Radiohead can even dream about.

For someone like me who loves every note Django Reinhardt ever played this 5-CD collection and another 4-CD set also available on Amazon.com, "Django Reinhardt Volume 2: Paris & London 1937-1948," are the Holy Grail. Between the two sets I can load up the CD player with 9 discs and listen to this most unbelievable of all guitar players show off for hours at a time.There is more swing, more fun, and more incredible guitar playing on these discs than you'll ever hear anywhere else.This set holds a lead over "Volume Two" because of the inclusion of the amazing fifth CD, where you will find great versions of "You're Driving Me Crazy" and "Tears," the heavenly "Solitude," and what I consider the greatest Reinhardt recording of all, "Liebestraum No. 3." In a 9-CD set covering decades of recordings, "Liebestraum No. 3" stands out as the absolute masterpiece of an absolute master.Even though they contain no lengthy linear notes, 'free booklets,' posters, etc., these are, without a doubt, the greatest multi-disc box sets I have ever heard.

If I could change one piece of the general perception of Django Reinhardt, it would be the &quot;Jazz Master&quot; label, which implies to too many people that this is stuffy concert hall music.Reinhardt was thE jazz guitar master, but his records are damn good fun. Like all the best jazz, it's overflowing with emotion but, more often than not, that emotion is witty, boisterous excitement.Don't limit yourself to just this Reinhardt CD. Considering the point in history when he was at his artistic peak, his music was generally well recorded, and several producers/engineers/labels have made great efforts to clean up the sound. If nothing else, check out the 5-CD &quot;box set&quot; (not really a box, but 5 great CDs shrinkwrapped together). While my Reinhardt collection is hardly complete, I have yet to come across a less-than-excellent recording of this wonderful music.

For a short stretch, Difford/Tillbrook were being compared to Lennon/McCartney. While the comparison may hold up on the mid-tempo Pop, Squeeze never put over a ballad and really couldn't rock.Still, when Squeeze was good they were really, really good. How on earth A&amp;M allows the bands greatest record, ARGY-BARGY, (where most of the best moments on this compilation were first heard) to remain out of print is just beyond comprehension.Squeeze was best at telling stories of love-story aftermath: &quot;Up The Junction,&quot; &quot;Another Nail For My Heart,&quot; &quot;Pulling Mussels,&quot; &quot;If I Didn't Love You,&quot; and &quot;Tempted&quot; are little Pop masterpieces.The least know tune here (at least to American listeners) may be the best. &quot;Annie Get Your Gun,&quot; swimming in quirky synthesizers and dreamy keyboards, cruises along in a way that Squeeze imitaters can only imagine.

Another Beatle masterpiece.The Beatles took a step back from the Pop psychedelia of SGT PEPPER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, wrote a mountain of songs on the banks of the Ganges with the Maherishi, and put together a more acoustic, rural feeling for the WHITE ALBUM.They touch a lot of bases here but, as always, there's still that...well, Beatle-ness to everything.Though not a 'concept' album, this record is truly best if listened to straight throough, from beginning to end.Track down a vinyl copy of the WHITE ALBUM; everyone should have their own copy of the iconic Beatle photos included in the original packaging.By the way, the vocals on the final bit of &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun,&quot; the neo-doo-wop section, are among the best things the Beatles ever did.

Great LP.This was the band the Beatles did NOT want to be, as they said so very often. It wasn't because the music stunk, they were just sick and tired of listening to the Shadows, who dominated European radio for years.Their sound is distinctive, though hardly original. It was an idea shared by Dick Dale and a host of others.In the hands of a great guitar player this setup, which highlights melody and removes the clutter of vocals and keyboards, can create miraculous things.Check out "Midnight." A simple little thing, just a softly pumped rhythm guitar, brushed drums, and a mild bass, with a catchy melody picked over the top.But you can't get it out of your head once you've heard it.Is some of this junk? Yep. Some of the later stuff sounds like that garbage they play on Dragnet whenever Joe & Frank wander into a "teen hangout" looking for Timothy Leary.The time and place to listen to this CD is in your car, on an open highway on the way to the beach. Very loud and very fast are a very fine combination.(By the way, hunt down CDs by the best unknown band ever influenced by the Shadows, Love Tractor.)

Though the tempo is virtually unchanged throughout this LP, and the bass drum is the lead instrument--two methods American listeners are not used to hearing--this album is still effective.This is religious, though not quite church, music. It feels more authentically Jamaican then anything else I have ever heard, thanks in part to Richard and Rob Fraboni's production, which leaves crickets, peepers, and band conversation in place between the tunes.

I love THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It easily ranks as one of my top 10 films of all time.Robbins is fantastic, Freeman is (as always) perfect. Direction is magnificent. The opening fly-by shot of the bus arriving at Shawshank is a classic piece of cinemaphotography. Even the score is magnificent.But I'm baffled by the editorial review by Jeff Shannon (above). Specifically, when Shannon writes &quot;we realize there's reason to believe the banker's crime was justifiable,&quot; what on earth is he talking about?!?Just for starters, the banker didn't commit the crime. And nowhere in the film is it even vaguely implied that it was a justifiable crime---JUSTIFIABLE DOUBLE HOMICIDE? HUH?!?

WHO ARE YOU was the moment when Pete Townshend stalled out, and the rumble it sent through the Who proved, once and for all, who the driving force in the band really was.Two of the albums best tracks--&quot;905&quot; and &quot;Trick Of The Light&quot;--came from Entwistle. They are typically Entwistle, which is to say, they are totally atypical songs. One a clone's lament, the other about a man who doubts the sincerity of a hooker. Fun stuff.&quot;Who Are You&quot; was the hit--I've never really understood why, the way it rambles all over the place--and &quot;Sister Disco&quot; was the fist-raiser on the subsequent US tour.But, as a writer and musician, I've always preferred &quot;Guitar &amp; Pen,&quot; the only song I've ever heard that accurately describes the the highs and lows of the creative process. The second version added to the CD is even better, a much more in-yer-face mix.

I waited for years for Keith to dump the Mickster and do a solo LP, and I was thrilled when he finally did.A couple of straight Chuck Berry-ish numbers were to be expected. But the Funk of &quot;Big Enough&quot; came out of nowhere, and I'm pretty sure that's Bootsy Collins who makes it work.I love the jam at the end of &quot;It Means A Lot,&quot; but it's the two slower tunes, &quot;Locked Away&quot; and especially &quot;Make No Mistake&quot; that convinced me that this is a classic album on a par with anything the Stones released except EXILE ON MAIN STREET.

Look at the photo of Clapton on the back of this LP. You don't need anyone to tell you that he was in serious trouble. Pete Townshend--to me, the most important figure in the history of Rock--seems to have pulled God from the edge of the abyss.Clapton's voice is thin here, but full of the emotion that had driven him to the edge. His playing is as intense as ever, though he often seems hesitant to let it loose. Luckily, he is backed by one of the most impressive pick-up bands ever heard: Townshend, Ron Wood, Stevie Winwood, Rick Grech, Jim Capaldi, Jimmy Karstein, and good 'ol Rebop.&quot;Layla&quot; is good, though the live versions are never as good as the perfect studio version. &quot;Badge,&quot; on the other hand, is powerful, and some of the lesser-known stuff--&quot;Roll It Over,&quot; &quot;Key To The Highway,&quot; and Winwood's &quot;Presence Of The Lord&quot;--are particularly effective.Townshend was a great believer in the Community of Rock. He was the one who rush-released Who covers of Stones songs when Mick &amp; Keith were arrested, he was the one who booted Abbie Hoffman off the stage at Woodstock, because he wanted a Rock event, not a political rant, and he was the one who made this bid to dig Clapton out of a self-dug grave. If you've read some of my reviews, you know I have the ultimate respect for Townshend, THE RAINBOW CONCERT is one reason for that respect.

A bit heavy-handed at times, and more than a tad biased, Dennis King has still managed to patch together the only factual history of the LaRouche organization. My only real complaint is that it has not been reissued with updated information, carrying the story of this politico-cult to it's current status as some kind of latter-day Hole In The Wall Gang in suburban Washington DC.

A great movie, but tough for anyone familiar with the book it came from, or the actual events both were base on, to watch because it skims over huge hunks of material.Still, it is a mostly accurate portrayal of the events that brought Nixon's reign to an end and really put the Post on the journalistic map.

One of the true classics of Elton's prolific early period and one of the greatest piano records in all of Pop, HONKY CHATEAU has stood the test of time, remaining fresh and less dated than many of its contemporaries.Except for "Mellow." Yech.But the high points of this CD are many: "Honky Cat," "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters," the always fantastic "Rocket Man," and the overlooked "Hercules," which really would have fit in better on DON'T SHOOT ME I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER.At this point in his career Elton could have had hits (and good ones at that) if he'd been singing the phone book. Luckily for us Bernie Taupin was writing great lyrics. Taupin gets the occasional jab from rock critics; I couldn't disagree with them more. Taupin knew how to touch people (people my age anyway) with a few carefully chosen phrases. Did he spell it out like Lennon or Townshend? No. Did he know how to speak to his audience? Obviously, yes.A great LP.

What the soundtrack to KILL BILL does best is point out what a great director Tarantino is.The movie comes across as fast, furious, almost manic. When you listen to the soundtrack you realize all of that animation came from the visual swirl Tarantino put on the screen, because the music is generally atmospheric and decidedly downbeat. To some degree PULP FICTION worked on the opposite tack, with less action and a more uptempo soundtrack. I suppose the tension between the audio and visual tracks is part of the attraction of Tarantino films; I know it was worked to perfection in RESERVOIR DOGS, particularly during everyone's favorite Ear scene.The "Kill Bill" soundtrack is more a curiousity than anything else. There isn't much thrill to driving your car while this is on, and you sure aren't going to dance to it. The whistled "Twisted Nerve" was perfect in the film but is just plain goofy when forced to stand on its own. The inclusion of Lucy Lu's speech at the council meeting is pointless; and the run through of some "Kung-Fu"-like sound effects is only fun the first time you hear it.I love the 5.6.7.8's, but what on earth is this gibberish from 'The RZA'? I've only seen the movie once, but I don't recall "Ode To Oren Ishii", a three minute rant and rave about Lu's character. It's stupid (at one point he rhymes the word "off" with "off" and "off"....duh), it's annoying, neither rapped nor sung, just screamed by some guy with marbles in his mouth who can't open his yap without "Yo!" coming out at least once every sentence, and it doesn't fit with anything else on the CD. It's time to put an end to the obligitory nod to hip-hop on all soundtracks. It doesn't always work.When it comes right down to it, I guess I don't much care for this soundtrack. It is incomplete, the sound quality isn't always up to snuff, and the inclusion of the RZA tracks is annoying.It's my own fault, though. What I really want is KILL BILL on DVD, and I was too impatient to wait for it, so I bought what I thought might be the next closest thing. Ah well.

While most of the tunes on this CD are dull and lifeless covers, and the audio clips from a handfull of NBA games are oddly chosen and aurally challenged, it IS worth owning, because it is the one and only place where you can get a full-length copy of Marvin Gaye's fantastic version of the Star Spangled Banner, recorded live at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game. It's a miraculous rendition, spoiled somewhat by a corny 'sounds of the game' intro and some sound engineer twisting too many knobs about two minutes in.

This is where the Andrew Sisters came from, to a large extent; what the Andrews were to World War II, the Boswells were to the Great Depression.My fav is &quot;An Evening In Caroline,&quot; a lovely lullaby of the old south which gets a good Manhattan brush-up at the end.

An excellent version of &quot;Blue Rhondo A La Turk,&quot; the classic &quot;Take Five,&quot; and a complete indifference to pseudo-intellectual modern critics who don't think TIME OUT is bluesy enough make this one of my favorite jazz records, ever.I won't go into the details on time changes--there are plenty of other reviews here that do that, if you're interested--but I will say I find it endlessly fascinating that all those exotic times sound just plain swingin'.

All the acclaim and legend surrounding this collection is true, and anyone who is interested in American music really should start here.A word of caution to the uninitiated, though: Robert Johnson did not play the electric blues which are the staple of modern American blues and the roots of Rock n Roll. This is acoustic blues music, solo vocal with (incredible) acoustic guitar accompaniment. It is amazing, amazing stuff--just try to duplicate the guitar parts and you'll understand what a master Johnson was--but don't be looking for rockin' rhythm sections or the big bass sound of later bluesmen.

Considered a disaster upon it's release, LONDON TOWN, heard from a distance of more than 20 years, is actually a pretty good record.It was tossed off by critics and the public in 1978 because McCartney used a much lighter touch throughout LONDON TOWN than he had on Wings preceding studio LPs BAND ON THE RUN, VENUS &amp; MARS, and AT THE SPEED OF SOUND, and the arena-size rock of the live WINGS OVER AMERICA.LONDON TOWN does sound a bit too much like some forgotten America record for me to call it great, but it has it's moments, and they are all softies: &quot;I'm Carrying,&quot; &quot;Deliver Your Children,&quot; the great &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; ,and Laine's &quot;Children Children.&quot;One of McCartney's finest &quot;chin up&quot; songs, &quot;Don't Let It Bring You Down,&quot; is on LONDON TOWN. One of the lost great McCartney vocal is hidden here: &quot;Backwards Traveller,&quot; a short ditty sung in his raspiest rocking voice. &quot;Famous Groupies&quot; is kind of fun. And the inclusion of McCartney's most overlooked 45, &quot;Girls School,&quot; on the CD is great, a pretty big deal rocker.Is there flubber on this LP? Yes. I've never liked &quot;With A Little Luck,&quot; and &quot;Cafe On The Left Bank&quot; is annoying. But there's plenty of good here. It's not the disaster critics made it out to be in 1978.

Hardly a great LP, MCCARTNEY II is still a lot more interesting than some of the more commercial and sterile studio work he put out in the 1980s and 90s.I've never been able to get past the sped-up vocals on &quot;Coming Up,&quot; but I like the thumping pseudo-billy of &quot;Nobody Knows,&quot; and &quot;Bogey Music.&quot; The instrumentals, especially &quot;Frozen Jap,&quot; are captivating, and &quot;One Of These Days&quot; is a very un-McCartneyish ballad.

I can't get too attached to any of the mountain of Louis Armstrong Greatest Hits packages, which all seem to feel a need to grab sides from all over his half-century+ long career, and this one isn't a whole lot better than the rest.Armstrong plays great, as always, and the song selection is OK, if you're looking for familiar tunes. But none of his truly great stuff is here. These are live versions, and they aren't all well-recorded. &quot;Cabaret,&quot; for instance, has some kind of synch problem that makes you feel as if someone is turning your bass/treble knob back and forth. On &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; you can hear somebody mumbling at several points. Also, the producer evidently had never heard of that modern recording breakthrough, the VOLUME KNOB. If he had, he would have faded the tunes in and out, rather than going from dead silence to a roaring crowd in a split second, as he does on virtually every tune here.&quot;Muskrat Ramble,&quot; the oldest recording here, is the best performance, and the best recording, on the disk, though even it sounds like a copy of a copy of a copy of the original master recording.By the way, the reviewer who complemented a version of &quot;&quot;Wonderful World&quot; must have been referring to a different record. &quot;Wonderful World&quot; does not appear on this CD.

Before Soul and Pop de-evolved into Disco--the scourge from which modern popular music has never really recovered--there were records around that were rhythm-oriented, danceable, and intelligent. That's a combination almost unheard of in 2001.The O'Jays, produced by the legendary Gamble &amp; Huff, were among the most popular proponents of the Philadelphia brand of Soul. Along with a few groups from LA, New York and Miami, the O'Jays took over AM radio in the early and mid-1970s, with great singles like &quot;Love Train,&quot; &quot;For The Love Of Money,&quot; and their masterpiece &quot;Backstabbers.&quot; This is a fine compilation of 10 tunes that are truly the best of the O'Jays.

Crowded House understand the craft of songwriting and record-making in a way miles beyond most of their generation. The first three tracks on this LP, along with &quot;Four Seasons In One Day,&quot; are as well-crafted as you'll ever hear.But it's the band's dependence on craft that keeps this LP from being a great one. There is a self-conciousness here that is hard to get past. The message that these are men at work, crafting product, honing their craft, is never overcome by any kind of passion or exhuberence.This is XTC with the fun surgically removed. They don't sound like they particularly enjoy what they're doing.It's their job.

&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was a brilliant, brilliant film; this soundtrack proves that the score was a vital piece of that brilliance.It is also fine music on it's own.I am at a loss of words, trying to explain what it is about the film and the music that moves people, myself included, so deeply. There is, I suppose, something in &quot;Suds On The Roof,&quot; and in the corresponding scene in the film, that speaks to everyone's desire to be a whole human being. Tim Robbins may play a fictional character, and perhaps one with no basis in reality, but the image of a convicted murderer taking such a risk simply to offer up to his fellow inmates a few moments of human comfort is a moving and humbling thing.The film, and by extension the music on this CD, is a study of basic human dignity, and a brilliant salute to it.The inclusion of &quot;Lovesick Blues,&quot; &quot;If I Didn't Care,&quot; and the gorgeous excerpt from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; makes this soundtrack complete but, for once, I wish some dialogue from the film had been included. Any of Morgan Freeman's wonderful narration would have been a nice addition.

I love the sound of "1972", and I'm OK with Rouse's soft vocal delivery. The dorkiness of the second tune, "Love Vibration," and its backing vocals, I can get past.But the inclusion of the second, "bonus" disc--really just a bunch of self-serving clips to play on your PC--and the additonal cost it ads to the price of the CD, combined with the pretentiousness of Rouse's lyrics keep me from really enjoying "1972."Here's Rouse's idea of an oh-so-sexy, good lovin' tonight line, from the song "Under Your Charms": "It's the end of the night and I'm feeling sexual. Can I get some love back that you concealed?"Makes you nauseous, doesn't it? Try this one on for size: "Is it just a love task, or do you feel it?"Yech. Most of the record sounds good, but you have to find a way to listen to it without noticing that the lyrics appear to have been lifted directly out of a highschool sophomore's notebook. I keep waiting for Rouse to sing "Two good two B Fourgotten" or tell me to party hardy all summer long. The word juvenile doesn't begin to cover it.There are a couple of gems here, though, including the title song and the great "Flight Attendent," though Rouse should thank his lucky stars that Lorne Michaels hasn't sued him for plagerizing Saturday Night Live's closing music for the song's coda.I've heard "1972" described as sounding like the Beach Boys or even Carole King, and there is something to those comparisons, but I really think the arrangements come closer to an old Glen Campbell record, minus the lower E-string guitar solos.

Nobody will ever mistake Bill Haley for Elvis Presley. In the 1950s, Presley was about 20 years younger and 50 pounds lighter than Haley, for starters.But &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; is easily one of the greatest records ever made. Period. End of argument.What's interesting to me is the way Haley mixed a big band sound with early rock sounds. The drums, bass and horns on this LP are straight out of Glen Miller. The deciding factor, in labeling &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; and &quot;Shake Rattle &amp; Roll&quot; are Haley's throaty vocals and some hot electric guitar.Some of the lesser known tunes here, especially &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; and the great &quot;Burn That Candle,&quot; make this LP a fun listen from start to finish.The production here is fantastic. An awful lot of these oldies repackagings are second, third and fourth generation re-recordings of the original tapes, or bad reproductions re-recorded in the mid-1970s--I have spent too much money trying to find a CD version of Chubby Checker's original &quot;Let's Twist Again&quot; to ever be tempted by that one again--but this is crystal clear and heavy duty hi fidelity.Sounds just like it did when you used to spin the 45 on your Mickey Mouse Close-n-Play, sans scratches and skips.

Having been a long time fan of Cocker without actually buying any of his stuff, I never realized what a bipolar artist he is. There's some rough stuff here, some soulful Blues, some vaguely Psychedelic tunes, and some truly awful light Pop.For me, the Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen stuff and Woodstock-era live stuff is Cocker's best. Heavily influenced by Ray Charles and other American soul acts of the 1950s and 60's, Cocker could growl with the best of them and knew how to wrestle a melody to his own uses.I would have been willing to pay the same price for a single CD if it would have meant the exclusion of a couple of disco-ish tunes and that train wreck of a song from &quot;Officer and A Gentleman.&quot;

Maybe it means I'm not a good fan of Tom Waits, but I prefer his love songs and lost-love songs to his grating jazz experiments.To me, the best things on this album are &quot;Hang Down Your Head,&quot; &quot;Downtown Train,&quot; (later trashed by Rod Stewart), and &quot;Blind Love,&quot; a great country drinking song helped out by Keith Richards backing vocals.Some of the other stuff is good too--&quot;Singapore&quot; and &quot;Jockey Full Of Bourbon,&quot; for example--but if I never have to hear &quot;Tango Till They're Sore&quot; again, it'll be too soon for me.

In 1971, Rod Stewart released &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot; AND a Faces LP, AND toured solo AND toured with the Faces. He was only 20 months removed from the Jeff Beck Group, where he sang on two classic LPs. He was IT in he summer of '71.So...what happened?Well--read the other reviews. You'll see Rod was trendy, not a trend setter. As much as I loved what he did from 1968-1975, I simply can't bear to here any of his newer work, ESPECIALLY his attempts over the last five years to recapture his glory by rehashing his classics.That said, &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story,&quot; along with &quot;Never A Dull Moment,&quot; his work with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces, particularly on &quot;A Nods As Good As A Wink To A Blind Horse,&quot; are fantastic.The overlooked link here is Ronnie Wood, who played on so many early Rod efforts, was the Keith Richard equivalent in the Faces, and even played bass and some second guitar on the Beck records. Wood was a master at getting a lot out of a little--he plays acoustic lead on rockers, dobro on &quot;That's All Right,&quot;, ukes, even some banjo. The classical intro to &quot;Maggie May,&quot; often clipped by DJs, is, well, classic. The Stones seem to have imasculated this great rock guitar player after &quot;Some Girls&quot;....the guts of this band--Mick Waller, Pete Sears, Ian McLagan--can be found all over the best of British rock from the era: Faces, Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, and more.I've heard &quot;Maggie May,&quot; I dunno, maybe 15,000 times in my life, and it stays great. It may be a weight around Rod Stewart's neck by now, but it is a piece of perfection that will be around long after &quot;Tonight's The Night,&quot; &quot;Young Turks,&quot; and &quot;Hot Legs&quot; are forgotten.While I love the cool guitar intro to &quot;(I Know) I'm Losing You&quot; (Ronnie Wood again), my favorite moment on this LP comes 3 minutes into the title track, when Rod and Maggie Bell jump a note to sing &quot;She claimed that it just ain't natural,&quot; and then, 4-1/2 minutes in, when the bass drops, Ronnie kicks in the rhythm guitar, and Maggie and Rod become insistant: &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story--Don't It?&quot;This is a great LP, made at a time when Rod knew how to work Rock, Soul, R&amp;B, Country and British Folk together into his own unique blend. Forget virtually every note he played after &quot;Atlantic Crossing,&quot; but don't write him off completely.Because in the summer of '71, he was IT.

WHO'S NEXT has the amazing ability to make anything it accompanies seem heroic, epic, larger than life. Even in the pointless Land Rover commercial in which &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; now appears, something important seems to be going on.But there is more going on here than fist waving and butane-lighter raising. Each of the band's four members were at their artistic peak and, as Entwistle pointed out, WHO'S NEXT is the only studio album that caught the power and volume of the Who's live performances.Townshend has occasionally slagged off this album, saying it was a few songs that were meant for the never-completed LIFEHOUSE project and some other songs he had around. Far be it from me to doubt the man, but the song's on WHO'S NEXT are some of the best Rock ever written. If Pete had this kind of stuff stuck in a drawer some where, he's even more of a genius than I realized.The centerpiece, and the best thing the Who ever did outside of QUADROPHENIA, is &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again,&quot; a stunning block of rhythm guitar, throbbing synths, and some of the greatest Rock drumming you'll ever hear. As far as I'm concerned, this is the greatest use of synthesizers ever recorded (and maybe the first use of a synth as a rhythm instrument), the most imitated guitar piece prior to Eddie Van Halen, the most recognizeable vocal moment, and the most inovative and powerful drum break (along with Ringo's solo on ABBEY ROAD) in all of Rock, all on the same song. It's final summation--&quot;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss&quot;--blew a hole in the side of revolutionary philosophy that it can't recover from.

Though the production is cleaner and more thorough than RAM, RED ROSE SPEEDWAY suffers from a decided lack of quality songs.There are some fine moments: &quot;My Love,&quot; a stunning soft-rocker with a great guitar solo, &quot;One More Kiss&quot; and &quot;Single Pigeon,&quot; two bouncing little ditties along the same lines as &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; or &quot;You Gave Me The Answer,&quot; and &quot;When The Night,&quot; a burner that was probably better live than in studio.And speaking of live, the inclusion of the &quot;My Love&quot; 45 b-side, &quot;The Mess,&quot; recorded live at the Hague, improves this CD greatly. This has been one of my favorite McCartney recordings for years. There's so much more power and energy in &quot;The Mess&quot; than on any of his studio stuff from this period.There's plenty of junk on RED ROSE SPEEDWAY. The medley is trite and tedious; if it was an attempt to recreate side two of ABBEY ROAD it was a disatrous failure.Surely I'm not the only one who noticed &quot;Big Barn Bed&quot; appeared in truncated form on RAM? Truncated is how it should have stayed; it is pointless and dull.This is not a great McCartney LP, it's not even a particularly good one. It has some interesting moments, but I think he was just treading water here, getting the band together in front of audiences, preparing for the glory years that were just on the horizon for Wings.

Stevie moves into the slick &amp; funky 70s with a batch of classic singles and a couple minor missteps.Wonder proved his genius with great records like &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered,&quot; &quot;If You Really Love Me,&quot; &quot;For Once In My Life,&quot; &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday,&quot; and &quot;My Cherie Amour,&quot; and he took on the other musical giants of the day, successfully reworking the Beatles &quot;We Can Work It Out.&quot;The syrupy &quot;Never Dreamed You'd Leave Me In Summer&quot; exposes the Achilles heal that has always dogged Wonder's career; such esoteric records gave credance to critics who argued that Wonder was more interested in displaying his musical genius than entertaining his audience. But the cream has always outwayed the crud on Wonder records.Buy this CD, GREATEST HITS VOL. 1, and both volumes of ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM to build an overview of one of America's true musical geniuses.

WINGS GREATEST has probably been outdated by WINGSPAN--McCartney has shown no shame in releasing a rather lengthy list of Best Of/Greatest Hits packages--but this CD is still a fine little collection of some of the best singles of the 1970s by thE master of Pop.For American listeners it's all going to be familiar with the exception of the final track, &quot;Mull Of Kintyre,&quot; which became the best-selling single in UK history but barely cracked the charts in the US. Only Macca could make bagpipes sound cool on a Pop record. If for no other reason, buy WINGS GREATEST to have a copy of this great, great love song to the Scottish coast.

You've heard and heard and heard that DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is a masterpiece of recording and production. That's true.Often overlooked in the discussion are the immaculate and passionate playing, and the inspired songs, with lyrics that sound as much like Charles Dickens as anything else.I imagine DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND are the two CDs bought first by new CD-player owners. They are similar in that they were produced by geniuses, played and written by masters, and present a complete fictional worlds that listeners are drawn into so strongly that they cannot easily be forgotten.

The closest you can come to hearing quality recordings of the Beatles pre-Sullivan stage show, PLEASE PLEASE ME documents the Beatles just stepping out of the shadow of the 1950s, searching for their own voice.Luckily for them (and us) the Beatles listened to everything and covered only the best. It's hard to go wrong with Goffin/King (&quot;Chains&quot;) or Burt Bacharach (&quot;Baby Its You&quot;), and even the lesser known stuff--&quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;--works in the hands of the Beatles. Thier best cover, &quot;Twist &amp; Shout,&quot; crackles here, and the first major set of McCartney/Lennon originals are pearls.As great as this album is, who could have guessed in '63 that it was only prelude, and would be considered a minor work by Beatle standards?Other than Brian Epstein?

You try and try and try to not like a song like "Yellow Submarine," and then you catch yourself singing along. Takes all the seriousness out of your oh-so-important adult life, doesn't it?I've always liked this album, and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, specifically because of their weirdness. RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, and SGT. PEPPER may have hit their targets more precisely, but the Beatles really let themselves go wild on YELLOW SUBMARINE and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.The let-down is the George Martin stuff--not a knock at Sir George, but it doesn't do to have six Beatles tunes followed by a block of instrumental soundtrack stuff. Anyone at EMI ever think of adding one more Beatles tune and alternating Beatles/Martin/Beatles/Martin? Might have worked.This LP also boasts two of my favorite Harrison recordings, "Only A Northern Song" and "It's All Too Much." "It's All Too Much" may be the most purely psychedelic recording, lyric, and video of all time, just shimmering with energy.

Kate Bush is one of the most creative artists in Rock, and deserves better than the American market ever gave her.This is a fine collection of her hits, but I've never understood why Bush and EMI felt the need to include a &quot;new vocal&quot; version of &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; What was the problem they saw in the single version, which gave Bush her first major UK hit and was her signature record for years?Other than that I have no complaints, except that this could easily have been a double LP.

An absolutely incidiary piece of Pop.It's little wonder the Beatles drove teeny-boppers wild with this stuff in 1964/65, it still drives me crazy after literally thousands of listenings 35 years later. The songs, the arrangements, the playing, the singing, the production: it's all perfect.Pure fun and refined energy--not the thrash-about high-speed drone so many bands, then and now, mistake for energy--is what the Beatles were all about.The Ed Sullivan Show and A Hard Day's Night are where most American's first fell for the Beatles. The film and this soundtrack are still great places for anyone to begin their love affair with the world's best Pop band.

There are those who will tell you this is Macca's finest post-Beatles moment. Personally, I disagree, preferring the studio polish of BAND ON THE RUN and TUG OF WAR.On the other hand, MCCARTNEY was made during the years of Macca's finest voice, when he could sing the hair off a titmouse from 1000 yards, and the songs he apparently tossed of while riding out a Beatles-breakup-induced-depression in Scotland have a quiet bounce you won't find on his later LPs.And there is more than a little historic significance to MCCARTNEY that Beatle peoples (read: I) find noteworthy; it was the conflicting release dates of MCCARTNEY and LET IT BE that were the preverbial final straw for Macca and Lennono.I've always had a soft spot for the instrumentals on MCCARTNEY, which allow McCartney's talent for tasty melodies to run free.MCCARTNEY also carries two of my absolute favorite McCarney bits, back to back. "Junk" and "Singaling Junk" are just gorgeous, the kind of thing you'd hope La Big Mac would sing if you handed him your guitar at the end of a hard day. And "Maybe I'm Amazed" is--maybe--one of the classic performances by any Beatle or ex-Beatle. Macca's vocal on "Maybe I'm Amazed" ranks with the very best Lennon.By the way, I remember watching some tired old game show around the time this LP came out, and hearing a scandalized audience react with childish giggles and gasps when the host asked the question: "On the cover of the new album by Beatle Paul McCartney, what can be seen peeking out of his coat?"The answer, of course, is McCartney's new baby.

After a decade of playing Lennon-McCartney tunes while most of his material gathered dust, Harrison burst at the seams and out came ALL THINGS MUST PASS, a great, though flawed, album.Any album with a song as majestic and flawless as "My Sweet Lord" can't be too bad. There are a batch of classics ("What Is Life," "If Not For You" (co-penned with Bob Dylan), "Awaiting On You All," and the gorgeous title-tune; and near-classics ("I'd Have You Anytime," "Wah-Wah," "Isn't It A Pity").Harrison layered his own voice over and over on this LP, constructing heavenly choirs and Beach Boys-quality backing vocals. The acoustic numbers are intimate, the rockers are big. 3/4 of this album is fantastic.The flaws, though, are large and ugly. ALL THINGS MUST PASS was a triple-LP that could easily have been trimmed to a double disc. The "jams" on the second CD were the problem, really just long roars of self-indulgence, they leave a bad taste in your mouth for hours after listening.Still, ALL THINGS MUST PASS is a classic, and well worth the cover price. The good things on this CD are the best things Harrison did post-Beatles.

It would be pretty hard to make a bad album when you start off with Jimmy Martin singing the &quot;Grand Ole Opry Song,&quot; and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band does not disapoint. WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN is fantastic music.What other band would have attempted anything like WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN? This is more than a tribute to the roots music the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band loved, it is a complete bowing down to the masters of Country and Bluegrass--no member of the NItty Gritty Dirt Band sings lead on this LP until the 15th track. The 15th track! Talk about humility.I've told friends, if you want to get a basic understanding of traditional American music, and don't want to sink a lot of money into a large Country/Bluegrass collection, there is no better place to start than WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN. It was a stroke of genius to put the LP together in 1972, and it is a masterpiece that everyone should own today.

I'm a lifelong McCartney fan and get quite defensive when I hear some of the mindless criticism thrown his way, but even I'm getting to the end of my rope on all the Greatest Hits/Best Of packages--in addition to ALL THE BEST there's WINGS GREATEST, WINGSPAN, and who knows what all else. That said, ALL THE BEST is a nice little thing, a bit more complete than WING'S GREATEST, more compact than WINGSPAN.There are some production glitches--someone seems to have muted a few instruments 3/4 of the way through the classic &quot;Listen To What The Man Said,&quot; for instance--and the inclusion of the B-side clunker &quot;C-Moon&quot; is questionable.But Macca knows how to make great Pop singles, and this CD is loaded with them. In addition to the cream of his best solo years--the songs from BAND ON THE RUN and VENUS &amp; MARS, and the singles from the same period--some wise man decided to include the live version of &quot;Coming Up,&quot; which is so much better than the sped-up vocals version found on MCCARTNEY II.This is a nice package, but my advice, as always, is to buy up all the original LPs instead of the compilations. McCartney is thE master of Pop, and the original studio albums--and the great live CD WINGS OVER AMERICA--are worth it.

This is a decent enough attempt at a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package but, like all such efforts, it doesn't represent the artist completely.&quot;Crazy On You&quot; and &quot;Barracuda&quot; are great Rock singles and there are a half dozen other classic rock-radio tunes here. But the exclusion of some of Heart's quirkier stuff, including the live version of the epic &quot;Mistral Wind,&quot; make them seem too much like a female version of Journey. It was the mysterious, fantasy-land stuff that set Heart apart from a lot of the 70s/80s hair bands who really couldn't carry their guitar cases. &quot;Bebe Le Strange&quot; only hints at what I'm talking about.I'm also dissapointed to find the slower, duller version of &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; included on this disc...and who really wanted to hear Heart's version of &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot; which should never have gotten further than sound check?By the way, for the few critics who have taken the opportunity to ridicule &quot;Barracuda&quot; as something less than worthy of airplay...if you were a 16-year old guy when the record was released in 1977, you would understand. Ann Wilson was an awakening.

An oddly moody album, coming from the man everyone loves to chide for his inate good humor, FLAMING PIE finds McCartney in a contemplative mood, looking back and a bit worried about the future.There are more colors and tones here than on any Macca LP since LONDON TOWN, and La Big Mac hits on most cylinders. &quot;Somedays,&quot; &quot;Young Boy,&quot; &quot;Beaufiful Night&quot; are wonderful tracks, and there's plenty of fine stuff here.&quot;Calico Sky&quot; and &quot;Little Willow&quot; are my favorite 'soft' McCartney tracks in a long, long time. I've heard he wrote &quot;Calico Sky&quot; for Linda, but it makes me wish Macca would do a kids LP, nothing but the sweet lullabyes he does so well.FLAMING PIE doesn't quite meet the standards of MCCARTNEY or BAND ON THE RUN, but it stands with VENUS &amp; MARS, SPEED OF SOUND, TUG OF WAR and others as a 2nd-Tier McCartney record, which is to say it's top flight.

The great, lost McCartney experiment.Where on earth was the promotion for this fine record? I understand McCartney's wish for a cool approach, to go along with the subtlety of the music, but what's the point of releasing a record if nobody knows about it?I love this record--there is a guitar riff that floats in and out of "fluid" that I can't get enough of. Oddly enough, this instrumental record reminds me more of the first "McCartney" solo LP than anything else (except, perhaps, early Pink Floyd) (kidding).So quick--why does McCartney choose "The Fireman" for his alter ego?Because "The Fireman rushes in from the pouring rain," as he said in "Penny Lane."Very strange.

If you sat through &quot;Life With Lions&quot; or any of the early John &amp; Yoko stuff--even if you heard the first Fireman album and didn't like it--don't let that ruin a chance to hear this superb CD.Because, unlike the others--This is Music.McCartney has waited until late in life to explore all those musical avenues everyone said were open to him. Some of it (the Liverpool Oratio, for instance) has been fantastic, others (Standing Stone) not quite so good. But who would have thought, when he was issuing singles like &quot;Girls School,&quot; that he would ever be able to stretch himself so strongly?Rushes is a great, great recrod. Though you won't find yourself singing along or humming it on the way to work, you will find yourself lost in it, wondering where the time went.

It's taken me years to fully recognize the brilliance of Ringo Starr's drumming.Listen to the intro and fills on &quot;From Me To You,&quot; a tune which was lost in the mania in the US, but became a standard in the UK, where the Beatles used it as their signature tune on the BBC. More obviously, listen to the drum intro to what I consider the greatest early Beatles record, &quot;She Loves You,&quot; and the thunder cracks Starr throws when the band returns to the intro prior to the second verse. He could swing, and when people talk about the BEAT in Beatles, they're talking about Starr.There are 16 good reasons to grab this CD, if you don't already have theses singles in some other form. For my money, the volume pedal George uses on &quot;Yes It Is,&quot; Paul's hair-raising Little Richard vocals on the rockers, John's over-the-top ferver on &quot;Bad Boy,&quot; and Ringo's drumming throughout are great reasons to own this CD. &quot;She Loves You&quot; is easily one of the very best records ever made.The German versions of two Beatles tunes are nothing more than a curiosity.

FLOWERS IN THE DIRT saw an improvement in McCartney's song writing after a few lean years, and the emotional disconnect so many critics find in Macca's post-Beatles work was shed.&quot;Put It There,&quot; a song McCartney said came from the words of his father, is a great little tune, yet another in a long line of Macca 'keep yer chin up' songs that always work for me. &quot;Figure Of Eight&quot; is a throbbing rocker, and &quot;My Brave Face,&quot; despite some pretty ambiguous lyrics, is a sparkling piece of Pop.As so often is the case, McCartney stumbles through the 2nd half of this CD with a series of wandering slow tunes. Still, FLOWERS IN THE DIRT is an interesting ditty, one of the better discs of McCartney's last 12 or 15 years.

I read somewhere that Elvis, in his early days, cited Dean Martin as his major vocal influence. After listening to this CD, it's obvious the King was being sincere.For those of us who only know Martin from his &quot;Celebrity Roast&quot; television show, Dean-O's old records are a revelation.Such an incredible voice. He didn't get the songs that writers were throwing Sinatra's way, but he made the most of what he got. As the corny old saying goes, Dean Martin could have sung the telephone book and made it sound good.&quot;Ain't That A Kick In The Head,&quot; &quot;Volare,&quot; and &quot;That's Amore&quot; are the best known tunes here--and probably the best songs here as well--but listen to this man sing, even on the lesser stuff. He had pipes that were just a step above so many singers who had more hits.And I kind of like &quot;That Certain Party,&quot; the opening tune Martin does with Jerry Lewis. Martin &amp; Lewis were a show-biz powerhouse for years, and &quot;That Certain Party&quot; captures the comic power they had--and also shows off those Martin pipes again.

An absolute classic.Though FEAR &amp; LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS is the better known Thompson book--due in large part to the marketing for the gawd-awful Johnny Depp film of the same name--FEAR &amp; LOATHING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL '72 is far and away the best book Thompson ever wrote.A heady mix of drug-addled meandering and backroom politics, FEAR &amp; LOATHING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL '72 is the closest look most of us will ever get at two of the strangest existences available to 20th century Americans: hardcore politics and hardcore drug abuse.

The greatest solo record by any ex-Beatle and one of the best records of all time, no question about it.PLASTIC ONO BAND isn't a whole lot of fun, though. It's an album about pain and loneliness and depression.What I think is often overlooked in reviews of PLASTIC ONO BAND is Lennon's amazing singing. From the raspy growl of &quot;I Found Out&quot; to the whispers and moans of &quot;Hold On&quot; to the angelic emotion of &quot;God,&quot; Lennon is masterful.&quot;Well Well Well&quot; and &quot;Remember&quot; are great, great tracks, but &quot;God&quot; is simply beyond comprehension, perhaps the best and arguably the most significant song of the rock era. It's been made cliche over the years by rock critics, but &quot;God&quot; was an obvious, painful and very jarring break, not just for Lennon but for those already choosing sides in the McCartney/Lennon feud, and for those trying to decide if the 60's thang could or should go on.PLASTIC ONO BAND was so very different from everything else; people forget how earth shattering it was. Unlike IMAGINE and a lot of other things which get a lot more plaudets to this day, it has not aged badly at all. If anything, it sounds fresher today than ever; it is certainly just as important.This is the record that I listen to and realize how much I miss having John Lennon around; and it is the one that makes me realize how far Rock and Pop have fallen since thier pinnacle now more than 30 years ago.

MUSWELL HILLBILLIES is a true Classic, overlooked by way too many rock fans.In the era of concept albums whose reach generally exceeded their grasp--TOMMY, SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST, and anything by Pink Floyd--Ray Davies took on more down to earth topics: urban decay, urban renewal and, always, the problems of the common man often left behind in the modern world.&quot;20th Century Man,&quot; &quot;Holiday,&quot; and a half dozen others on MUSWELL HILLBILLIES are true greats. The Kinks out-rural the late 60s/early 70s Stones and sound more like a full-fledged band than they would again until MISFITS.To my ears, with a couple of decades since its original release, MUSWELL HILLBILLIES remains the best album the Kinks ever recorded

The first big step towards Pop from their English-Blues beginnings, FLEETWOOD MAC is the Christine McVie-dominated calm before the RUMOURS storm.McVie's &quot;Warm Ways,&quot; &quot;Over My Head,&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me,&quot; and Nick's &quot;Landslide&quot; are the songwriting highlights here, a real showcase of female sensibility in a band previously known for heavy macho posing.The song everyone talked about at the time, &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; isn't really much of a song at all. Buckingham's guitar work on the tune is fantastic--he's an underrated player--but there is virtually no melody in the verses and the lyrics are simplistic at best. The song works because of the band playing it, not the woman who wrote it.This was a big deal album. Little did we know it was just a warm-up for their next LP, RUMOURS.

For all the praise heaped on the Yardbirds by those lucky enough to have seen them live, the band always seemed vexed by the studio.Jeff Beck blazes through &quot;Over Under SideWays Down&quot; and &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago,&quot; but most of the rest of this LP is fairly standard British psychedelic blues circa 1966. The Dukes of Stratosphear do it better.

Pete Townshend is the best thing that ever happened to Rock, and EMPTY GLASS is his solo masterpiece, an insightful, invigorating confessional from a man on the edge.Townshend addresses punks, aging, drinking, music critics, work ethic, and his lifelong quest to find some meaning in life. Townshend is Rock's great philosopher and, like all great philosophers, he frequently dips into deep dark spells when he concludes life is pointless.The centerpiece of the album is the title song, in which the dueling elements at Townshends core--the rough boy, tough guy (the adolescent Mod, perhaps?), and the softer, more fragile adult--battle for supremacy.That's some pretty heavy stuff, but Townshend bounces back from those depressions--&quot;Don't worry, smile and dance, you just can't work life out.&quot;Townshend's backing band, including members of Big Country, isn't the as hard as the Who, but does rock, and can float through the softer sections of EMPTY GLASS in a way the Who had some trouble attaining.I am completely stunned by the ho-hum reviews others have given this masterpiece. EMPTY GLASS represents the very essence of Townshend, and the remnants of 1960s Rock, as the 80's began and those icons hit their mid-30s. There have always been those who have critisized Townshend for his self-discovery and his search for a greater meaning. For me, it is the questions Townshend asks, and the search he has made, that make him the most important thinker in Rock, and a worthwhile role model.

I too was suckered into FEVER TO TELL by some oh-so-hip pre-release reviews, and I am dissapointed with the record.The band plays everything through a muddy echo chamber and sounds like nothing so much as Romeo Void without the saxophone, the sense of humor, or any semblance of a melody.I've heard this record--or at least a lot of records that it imitates--a million times before, and it was dull then too.

I have yet to hear a "tribute" album that is worth the time it takes to listen, but I still get drawn into buying them.Here's the problem with "tribute" records: if the artists go the note-for-note reproduction route, what's the point? Who cares if Phish can reproduce "5:15"? (They don't quite, by the way. They play the same notes, but all of the passion of the original is sucked out of the performance, and the vocals sound like they were done after running a marathon) If you want to hear the original, you listen to the original...right?If the artists go for reinterpretation, who cares? How many people listen to the Who's version of "Pictures Of Lily" and wishes it had been slower and sung in a smug monotone, ala David Bowie's version here? Classic songs done differently--with some very rare exceptions, like Hendrix's "All Along The Watchtower" and Joe Cocker's "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window"--don't work.Perhaps most dissapointing of all is the generally lazy vocals on this CD. Eddie Veder always sounds like he's asleep on his feet, but Sheryl Crow, David Bowie, and the singers for Phish and Fastball all sound like they phoned it in too.Paul Weller comes off best here, but that may just be because he has spent his entire career imitating the Who.

...Hank Williams, THE Hank Williams, was the greatest C&amp;W Star who ever lived, bar none. And this is the album to grab, no matter what kind of music you think you like, if you want to hear a masterful songwriter and singer. There's also another version &quot;20 Of Hank Williams' Greatest Hits,&quot; available on Mercury CD, but go for the 40 hits version. Hank Williams never released a bad record, as far as I know, so the bigger the better.He wrote and played in the idiom he knew, but Hank Williams was more than C&amp;W. The band plays bluesy (country bluesy, at least), and he sings jazzy. To me, Hank Williams wrote and sang American standards, absolute classics that will be sung 100 years from now.My personal favorites are &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Jambalaya,&quot; one imortalized in The Shawshank Redemption, the other a certifiable American classic.Next time you're sitting in front of a blank TV screen, waiting to turn it on until 9:10 so you'll be sure to miss that sequined beer belly screeching &quot;Are You Ready For Some Football?!?&quot;, put on this record and enjoy some real music.He was thE master.

The first major step U2 took from fashionable cult status to superstardom, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE seems, from the distance of more than 15 years, a muffled and mixed set of atmospheric Rock.Listening to this CD now it seems obvious that there's a little too much Brian Eno and a bit too litle U2 in the mix. The songwriting is all over the map, from solid rockers--&quot;A Sort Of Homecoming,&quot; &quot;Pride,&quot; &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;--to extended riffs, like &quot;Wire,&quot; and lazy atmospherics like &quot;Promenade&quot; and &quot;4th Of July.&quot;And there's &quot;Bad,&quot; a piece of brilliance.At the time it was released, it seemed THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE was a major leap forward and a pinnacle of U2's career. Looking back, it was only the first step, and not the height of their career.

NRBQ got lost in the late 70's mix because they were a fun-time college-radio band at a time when college radio was overrun by angry young punks.That's too bad for the average schmoe, who never got to hear much of this great LP.In the late 1970s NRBQ gained a reputation for amazing live shows where, among other things, they would take requests from the audience and could faithfully reproduce virtually any song mentioned. They were a good time without being stupid. To hear Joey Spampinato hum &amp; strum &quot;I Love Her, She Loves Me&quot; is to understand what the sweet side of Pop was meant to be.NRBQ AT YANKEE STADIUM is so full of good songs it just makes you sick that everyone hasn't heard it. It is a victory for average man, who wants to have fun without being stupid, who wants to sing without being a sap, who wants to dance without fear.

For all of Clapton's talent--and he is one of the 5 greatest guitar players of his generation, don't let anybody kid you about that--he displayed an amazing lack of ability to judge material.For all the talk of his sticking to his &quot;blues roots&quot; when he jumped the Yardbirds ship, the tune they argued over wasn't much different than what they'd been doing for nearly a year, and every band he landed in for several years followed basically the same recipes.As anyone wh has seen the film of Cream's live performances or saw the band in person can testify, they were a thundering group, three manic musicians who could really set a place afire, even if they did tend to take the late-60's penchant for endless solos to new lengths. Unfortunately, the power of those performances doesn't really transfer to an audio-format: the live stuff here is ponderous, at best.The studio stuff is wild; the production is skewed in an effort--generally successful--to bring the bass and drums forward to an even keel with guitars and vocals. It takes a little getting used to , but it's a taste worth aquiring.I've always loved &quot;Pressed Rat &amp; Warthog,&quot; though I wonder how the Clapton who turned up his nose at the Yardbirds allowed himself to appear on it.

Q: How important does Bruce Springsteen remain in the eyes of American record buyers?A: What other musician had the weight of articulating an artistic response to 9/11 placed on his shoulders?There is no other rocker alive that I wanted to hear from after 9/11. I'd love to know what Lennon would have said, but that option remains closed.So this will always be looked at as the 9/11 Springsteen record. That's too bad, because it distracts from what is a great CD--and it's just not fair to ask Bruce Springsteen to sing away the nightmares brought about by one of the worst stupidities in human history.It's hard to absorb all of a Springsteen album in the initial go-round. I spend the first few days just enjoying the sounds and then the lyrics and the characters start to sink in a while later. He is, I've always said, a novelist stuck in a rock star.That said, the first thing I've noticed about THE RISING is that there aren't many characters to speak of. A lot of this is abstraction--to be completely analytical about it, there are lots of verbs and adjectives and not many proper nouns. That makes it easier to grab on to some of the sentiment but will, I think, make some of these tunes drop off your radar after a short time. Kind of like LUCKY TOWN and some of the other non-E-Street records Springsteen has done. (On the other hand, &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; was a first-person singular tune with no other characters in it, and I consider it one of the Boss's best tunes. So wadda I know?)THE RISING is a very good record with some great cuts. After just a few days I'd say I'm hooked on the title track, &quot;World Apart,&quot; and the perfect &quot;Paradise.&quot;Frankly, I think the name of the album could have been called The Awakening, because that seems to be what it's about: receiving a cold slap across the face--literally, metaphorically, symbollically--that wakes you up, points out how the years and the miles have passed by; trying to make sense of where you are and where you thought you would be.I have only one specific complaint about THE RISING: where is Clarence? The sax isn't used much on this LP. That makes about 20 years since the Big Man played a big part on a Bruce record.By the way, if the Letterman appearance tonight is any indication, the Boss is thin again, Little Steven is still wearing the silk do-rag, Nils Lofgrin still doesn't quite fit.

I can't imagine what I could say about LAYLA that you haven't read or heard ad nauseum already. I'll just point out that it is, along with only a handful of other Rock records, an actual piece of art, not just a band fulfilling a contractual obligation or a series of ineffectual attempts at charting a single in order to make money.This is the real deal, an artist poring heart and soul into his music to tell a story of heartbrake, dispair and depression. And, while everyone has heard the guitar poetry and the blind rage of &quot;Layla,&quot; it is the drunken bravado of &quot;Key To The Highway&quot; and the almost religious glorification of the other on Hendrix's &quot;Little Wing&quot; that makes LAYLA AND OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS one of the classics for me.This is an absolute masterpiece, one of the greatest Rock albums ever recorded.

Another bit of proof that Springsteen is a true artist.He hasn't simply stolen characters from Steinbeck and others; he turned them into modern day men and women, melded and welded them into his own vision, made them a part of his ongoing observations of America.&quot;The highway is alive tonight, but nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes...where it's headin' everybody knows,&quot; Springsteen sings on the title track. That's a real downer, coming from a guy who used to use the Highway as a metaphor for hope. But these aren't the young &quot;Born To Run&quot; Jersey kids, who wanted to hit the road to find their fortune. The characters on TOM JOAD have been thrown on the road, displaced and hunting for a meal or a job. They want to get off the road but, as the Joads found in GRAPES OF WRATH, nobody wants you to stop at their place.As with so many of his recent records, Bruce delivers one absolutely flawless vocal. &quot;Highway 25&quot; sounds like &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; or &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; but is, thematically, cut from the same cloth as NEBRASKA. Like so much of NEBRASKA, it sounds like the courtroom confession of a killer, in this case a man who doesn't quite believe he let himself fall so far off the path. At the beginning of the song he works in a shoe store. He flirts with a customer, and before he knows it they are in &quot;a small town bank...well, I had a gun. You know the rest.&quot;There's so much more I could say--about Bruce's evolving use of symbolism and metaphor, about how cars and the road and rivers are used over and over in ways that shape character and event, about how he uses songs to write novels, and all the other pompous Critic-Talk--but what's the point. You get it.This is a GREAT album, great on a level that most popular music never even approaches.Frankly, I think the best of Springsteen--BORN TO RUN, THE RIVER, NEBRASKA, and THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD--are the kind of things Dylan always strived for, but only achieved on infrequent occasions.I don't consider Springsteen the new Dylan. I consider Dylan the old Springsteen.

I've never liked the idea of a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; it seems to me that institutionalizing the music and setting up some kind of semi-official Rock Aristocracy defeats much of the spirit and thrill of the music. It also seems to be yet another excuse for a lot of Rolling Stone nerd-critics to try and attach their names to those of their musical heroes.And, with few exceptions, this album proves how misguided this whole concept was. The inclusion of Melissa Ethridge is annoying but predictable; the fact that she gets more tunes on this 2-CD package than Springsteen, Dylan, Johnny Cash or any other artist is beyond belief. It would be understandable if she did something special but she is dull as dishwater, screaming "Hello Cleveland!" (that's a deep sentiment repeated ad nauseum by almost every singer on this CD) before screeching "Can you remember the fine days when Rock and Roll...wore a drrrrrrress?!?!?!" Kind of an odd sentiment coming from a woman who refuses to wear dresses, but that's neither here nor there, the important thing to keep in mind is that Etheridge can't sing and has an extremely hard time finding the melodies of the three classic tunes she tackles. The Ronettes and Supremes were due more homage than this.Disc 1 is rescued, temporarily, by Al Green, the most underrated singer of his generation, who turns in gorgeous renditions of "Tired of Being Alone" and "A Change is Gonna Come," but Chrissie Hynde does her very best to break the mood by screaming the name of every Cleveland suburb at the top of her lungs before phoning in a lackluster mumbling of "My City Was Gone."After that things pick up for quite a while. Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, John Fogarty all deserved more space on Disc 1, and Jerry Lee Lewis rocks on Disc 2. Springsteen's "Shake Rattle & Roll" is surpisingly slow and doesn't display the Boss's usual energy, but he understands what he's doing, something that can't be said for every act on this CD.Once The Killer and The Boss leave the stage, the show collapses. Natalie Merchant, Jackson Browne, Bruce Hornsby and especially the Allman Brothers all phone it in, stumbling through dull performances of songs it makes no sense for them to sing. Browne's version of Bob Marley's great "Redemption Song" is downright shameful, and it is embarassing to listen to Slash trying to remember the guitar parts to Hendrix' "Red House."Most annoying of all are the constant reminders that the show is in Cleveland, Cleveland rocks, this is for Cleveland and, over and over and over, "Hello Cleveland!!!" Outside the city limits, WHO CARES?!? For whatever reason, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has decided that Cleveland is the center of the universe...which probably goes a long way towards explaining why this album, and the Hall itself, have been ignored everywhere outside of Ohio.The Hall may have been a good idea, and the concept of this CD--a group of Rock giants covering classic Rock tunes in front of a live audience--is a good idea. Unfortunately, the reality of the Hall and the CD fall far short of the dream.

&quot;The Royal Scam,&quot; and then some. This is the first negative review I've written, and I will not brook argument.Somehow Steely Dan has gotten a reputation for being Jazz. I think anyone who has ever listened to 2 minutes of Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald or Oscar Peterson probably either laughs are gets nauseous to think that Jazz artists and poseurs Becker and Fagen have anything in common beyond their brand of cigarettes.If you listen to &quot;Aja&quot; or &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; or most anything else Steely Dan ever recorded, what you hear isn't Jazz, and it isn't Rock. For that matter, it isn't Pop or R&amp;B either.It's DISCO. Rolling Stone magazine loved Steely Dan because the group allowed Stone writers to feel artsy--'hey, saxophones and spanish drums! Far out!&quot;--but I contend that Steely Dan was the best hype-machine running in the 1970's, and I include Kiss and Casablanca records in my calculations. They convinced everyone that, while you might not like their sound, you had to respect it because it was &quot;serious&quot; music. Once again, saxophones and spanish drums smoked the average music reviewer.They covered their tracks by hiring great studio musicians and hanging out with the Doobie Brothers, but Steely Dan and much of the sound coming out of Miami in the mid-70's was just pre-DISCO, preparing for it's precipitous fall into the whole &quot;Do a little dance make a little love&quot; nightmare that began the end of Rock.If you want to put on some ugly clothes, shake your little behind and tell yourself you're hip, this is the group and the album for you.If you want something that rocks with soul, move along. Try the real deal--Santana, for instance.

It was only a matter of time before greater America woke up to Bluegrass music, the big-beat music with no drums that's been in our backyard for generations.Ralph Stanley sings songs of sorrow and he means it; I think the scary feeling many listeners talk about comes from Stanley hitting home, a deadeye bullseye on some archetypical fears.Great fiddle playing, too.

ANNIE HALL isn't Allen's greatest film--that would be MANHATTAN--but his warmest, his most approachable, his most inventive, and probably my favorite.What's most amazing about Allen's most creative period is the realism of his characters. They aren't the static, two-dimensional characters you find in most Hollywood productions, who stay the same from beginning to end. Allen's characters actually learn something from their experiences, actually grow and mature by the end of a film.

The lighter side of the depressed Lemmon which turned up in so many great films in the 60s and 70s. The man was a bona fide acting genius.But for my money Sandy Dennis steals the show. She glows through the rain and delays, muggings, mountains of garbage and all the rest. Somehow, through it all, with Lemmon quickly deteriorating and predicting doom around every corner, Dennis keeps some kind of suburban elegance. She makes a breakfast of Cracker-Jack after a cold wet night sleeping on the ground in Central Park look like heaven.

John Ford hits on all cylinders, Lee Marvin plays a classic bad guy, and John Wayne plays the stereotypical John Wayne character in a very non-stereotypical manner in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.Wayne plays the same basic character he'd played in so many other westerns. But, instead of being the young stud settling the Wild West, Wayne plays an aging dinasaur, his kind of justice increasingly unwanted and outdated. Easily Wayne's best performance.Stewart and Miles are good, though a bit of the lovey-dovey glazed looks could have been edited out, as far as I'm concerned.To me the best performance here comes from Lee Marvin. His Liberty Valance is a dirty, slimey, bullying psychopath. Brilliantly done.But who decided to give the bad guy a goofy name like Liberty Valance? Sounds like an 18th century piece of furniture.

Bette Davis at her wicked best.The movie is fine, but it would have been forgotten years ago if it weren't for Davis's great performance. She slaps the other actors down over and over with a withering barrage of firey glares and barbed--and witty--sideswipes.So fasten your seat belts--it's going to be a bumpy ride.

Obviously, this is great stuff.But the only reason to release it, to paraphrase George Harrison, is to show a lot of new bands what a truly great, truly powerful rock n roll band was REALLY all about.What I want to know is, why hasn't someone, after all these years, been able to get some of the truly great stuff sitting around in people's vaults onto LP/CD?For instance, the Beatles did live taped versions of Revolution and, I think, Hey Jude, to be shown on American TV...the Mike Douglas Show, I think. Absolutley rockin'....and the audio versions have never been made available. I'm not even sure if you can track down the video versions. Also, the stuff John and Yoko did on Mike Douglas, together and with other artists the week they co-hosted. Where's that?There must be tapes of McCartney's Scottish tour, when he'd just slapped Wings togther...Harrison jamming with Dylan, and Harrison's trip to San Fran in '67...all of the tapes they made in India (much of which morphed into the White Album)...Call me fanatic, but I want to hear it ALL! George Martin did the best, but is the rest just unlistenable?And is Live At The Hollywood Bowl no longer available? It's worth the price just for Things We Said Today!I am, unashamedly, still a rabid Beatles fan. They put off more creative energy in 7 years than the rest of Rock combined.

A great book about a Queen whose story reads more like "The Godfather" than you'd guess.Elizabeth I, thrust onto the throne while her country was still in the midst of it's centuries-long emergence from Roman rule, turned England into Great Britain through a heady mixture of guile, guts, and British steel(How's that for rhetoric?).It's a great book, as are most of Erickson's titles.

Yes, this book is almost entirely reprints of Coulter's columns, but don't despair! It's still loaded with all of the elitist facism her fans have come to love.Especially refreshing are Coulter's diatribes about the poor, who she claims bring it all on themselves.Hurray for deep thinking!

In addition to being the most unique bassist in Rock, John Entwistle had a great talent as the historian and documentarian of the Who, as ODDS &amp; SODS makes abundently clear.Twenty-three fantastic oddities from the greatest Rock band, and there's really only one I ever skip over. That's a batting percentage most bands would give their left Hiwatt for.There are three tunes here--&quot;Pure and Easy,&quot; &quot;Naked Eye&quot; and the studio version of &quot;Young Man Blues&quot;--that are absolute classics; they may never have been heard by the general public if not for ODDS &amp; SODS. Townshend was so sussed by the collapse of LIFEHOUSE that he seems to have shelved &quot;Pure and Easy&quot; (save a solo acoustic version on WHO CAME FIRST) and &quot;Naked Eye.&quot; Both tunes were cosmic in concert and are, to me, at the center of the Who's greatness. The version of &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; here is, if anything, heavier than the LIVE AT LEEDS/ISLE OF WIGHT/WOODSTOCK live versions. Townshend had perfected the fuzzy distorted guitar buzz by '67, and this track really blows a lot of the UK's blues-revival pretenders out of the water. The one-off of &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping,&quot; with Townshend taking the lead vocal, is great too.Gotta wonder about &quot;Cousin Kevin Model Child&quot; though. For starters, who the heck is singing it? I know it's been credited to Moon for a long time, but it sounds more like Legs Larry from the Bonzo's to me. A bit too camp for my taste--sounds too much like the Rocky Horror Show--and if I had to make a cut from this LP, it would be here.This is not a &quot;greatest hits/best of&quot; repackaging; it is a single-disc Who &quot;Anthology&quot; issued twenty years before the Beatles thought of doing their own. It's great, and you don't really understand the Who until you own ODDS &amp; SODS.

This may be the best Greatest Hits/Best Of compilation ever. Cline knew how to sing a tune, and she knew how to make singles that grab you by your collar and don't let you get away.These are songs you hear off a juke box in a diner at 2 a.m. and you suddenly understand. A cigarette, a cup of coffee, maybe some fries with brown gravy, and "She's Got You." It's something you can't recreate.And what a voice. I've heard, in recent years, people calling Wynonna Judd "the female Elvis." Wynonna does have a magnificent voice, but talk about having no memory--Patsy Cline was as close as there's ever been to a female Elvis. She was masterful.

Allowing Klaatu to be perceived for several months as the Beatles reunited under some mysterious guise (or perhaps promoting the concept outright) may have helped sell a few hundred thousand records, but it also blinded much of the world to a simple fact: KLAATU was a great LP in it's own right.If anything, I like KLAATU better than I did when it was released several lifetimes ago. It sings of a time when Pop stars tried to make actual Art, when records had meaning beyond which soda company would bid highest for the rights to every hit so they could use it as background for their latest 15 second commercial. Klaatu may not have had the talent of the Beatles or Pink Floyd, but they recorded at a time when any serious talent took the time and the dedication to put together something special, worth repeated listenings and more thought than your typical year 2003 hip-hop-rap-with-a-samba-beat-and-a-guitar-track-sampled-from-Yngwie-Malmsteen type garbage.The hit--a minor hit, as I recall--was "Sub-Rosa Speedway," I think, but there's a lot more to KLAATU than that. The opening tune, the cinemographic "Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft," is worth the price of admission; the shimmer of "California Jam" and "Hanus of Uranus" build toward the single, which was a Masterpiece.That's Masterpiece, with a capital 'M'."Sub-Rosa Speedway" may be the most under-rated single in Pop history, a piece of symphonic beauty McCartney would have been proud of. The lyric is like nothing in Top-40 history. Almost every tool developed in Pop history is used to perfection: horns, strings, power chords, melodic bass lines, a great vocal--they even steal the "chooga-chooga" backing vocals from "I Am The Walrus."KLAATU is great, "Sub Rosa Speedway" is a classic, and Klaatu deserved more than a two record deal.

Magnificent.THE RIVER alternates between rockers like &quot;Cadillac Ranch,&quot; &quot;I'm A Rocker,&quot; and &quot;Out In The Street,&quot; songs that sing of carefree summer teen years that sound like they're blasting from the windows of somebody's Camero along the boardwalk, and a big set of tunes that address the real world problems that tug at your heals behind those idyllic scenes.The real heart of THE RIVER are Springsteen's characters struggles with love and relationships. They're all searching for somebody, finding somebody...but then what? So many of them run into brick walls, finding out all too quickly that the happy ever after ends before it starts. Haunting tunes like &quot;Stolen Car&quot; are hard to get past:&quot;She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote when our love was young and bold. She said last night she read those letters, and they made her feel one hundred years old.&quot;But for all the hard times these characters come up against--losing love, driving girlfriends and their mothers to the unemployment office, struggling to keep a job--the final moment of THE RIVER is one of hope. After consoling a dying man at the scene of a horrific car crash, Springsteen sings of climbing in bed and watching his girl as she sleeps:&quot;I just lay there awake in the middle of the night, thinking about the wreck on the highway.&quot;The road, which had been a vehicle of hope and escape on all of Springsteen's previous records, has been transformed into a black line between life and death; it is his love and home and security that suddenly seem comforting, instead of smothering.But the next Springsteen LP, NEBRASKA, wouldn't stay at home...it follows those characters who chose to cross that black line and follow the road.

Maybe it's my own fault that this record seems so lame, so out of touch, so down right boring--I bought it and METAMORPHOSIS, the Stone's great 1975 LP, on the same day.When the Stones released METAMORPHOSIS they were reworking and re-releasing some classic, cutting edge, roots Rock &amp; Roll. Jagger was still a great singer, Keith Richard an innovative guitar player, and Mick Taylor a GREAT lead guitarist. Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts were the best rhythm section around.I guess it's the Stones playing on NO SECURITY, but you'd never know it from the sound on this second-rate live CD. It sounds more like some Stones 'tribute' band. Jagger is a mere shadow of his 60's and 70's self, the rhythm section--minus Bill Wyman--is pedestrian at best, the 'new' songs are vanilla and dull, and the renditions of classics are performed no better than your typical suburban bar band.There are times I wish the Beatles and Led Zep had gotten back together. Then I hear a post-SOME GIRLS Stones LP and realize every band has a finite life span. I wish the Stones would just fold camp and go home; releasing this kind of record is embarrassing to listen to, and demeans what they once were.If you think this is what the Stones were about, or has anything to do with the classic era of the band--1965-1975--you're missing the boat. They were one of the best, now they're records don't chart and their sound don't rock.

I have to agree 100 percent with the reviews below: This software was written without any consideration to the end user. Just getting the thing to make a sound--any sound at all--is a major undertaking. Instead of just programming the junk to use your soundcard, it is made so that it will remain mute until you search out the soundcard manually and inform the software to use it. Each and every @!?%$#@*&!!!! time you copy or create a track, you have to tell the software AGAIN to use the soundcard. I'd love to get an explanation from the manufacturer as to why this is--were they under the impression that some users would want to program music and then NEVER LISTEN TO IT?!?!?There are 4 or 5 possible 'views' of each tune on this software, but the layout, and the archane instructions that come with the software, could lead you to believe that that is really an astronomical figure. The guide book is written in an amazingly, astonishingly complex manner, making it virtually unuseable.I've had the software 3 weeks and have yet to get a second's enjoyment out of it. I've played music all my life and have done some composing on my computer before, but I can say without a shadow of a doubt I will never--NEVER--get any use out of this overly complex piece of junk. Everything about this appears to have been overdone by software engineers looking to impress other software engineers, with no thought of any kind given to the end user or how the software would be used.A complete and total waste of money. I'll never buy anything from Cakewalk again. Never.

This is such a great, great record.The music, like the artist, is muscular, feminine, smart, and sexy sexy sexy as hell.A big chunk of the credit has to go to producer Pierre Marchand, who put together an aural landscape that grabs the listener and gives them a firm shake.But, for all the fine performances here--the rock hard drumming on &quot;Building A Mystery,&quot; the great guitar play all the way through--the star of the show is McLachlan's angelic voice. She sells the rockers, but to hear her whisper &quot;I Love You,&quot; or the CD-single accapella versions of &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; through headphones is just too much heaven.And, as she proved to the nation on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and a thousand live audiences during her North American Tour, this woman is all that and more. If a boy-band had put together a live act or an album with 1/10th the depth and magnitude of this stuff, Arista would have multiplied the hype budget by 500.This is NOT a &quot;girl group&quot; LP. It's full-blown Pop at its best, a masterful album from a top flight artist. I can't get enough of it.

A very readable account of (one of) the moment(s) England was challenged by a continental power and Europe hung in the balance.Like Churchill more than three centuries later, Elizabeth I was helped quite mightely by the English Channel, but in her case the seemingly miraculous destruction of the Spanish fleet resulted in her near-deification.

What Ken Burns seems to have found in his work on THE CIVIL WAR is a deep and heartfelt sorrow; a real sadness for a country that tore itself apart, transforming itself from an 18th century agrarian culture to a 20th century industrial Republic in 4 years of unbelievably bloody war. The music of THE CIVIL WAR reflects that sadness and sense of loss.&quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot; is the best-known piece here, but it is the piano pieces--&quot;Battle Cry Of Freedom,&quot; &quot;Johnny Has Gone For A Soldier,&quot; &quot;All Quiet On The Potomac,&quot; &quot;Flag Of Columbia,&quot; &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;--and the piano and cello version of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; which most eloquently speak of the grandeur, and the horror, that the American Civil War visited upon its people.

Ken Burns is smart enough to realize that some of the best music in many films, including BASEBALL, is the incidental music. As he did with THE CIVIL WAR soundtrack, Burns includes plenty of the beautiful piano solos from the PBS special on this CD.The inclusion of the calls from The Shot Heard 'Round The World and Hank Aaron's 715th HR is a nice touch. Nothing drives people crazier than cranking that up real loud in afternoon traffic.Unfortunately, what you see in the film and hear on the soundtrack is what baseball was in this country, and what it is now. It's still a popular game, it still makes a lot of money, it still has a lot of fans. But the love for the game, the feeling so many of us had for the players and the teams, isn't there any more. Would a major political figure speak so poetically on behalf of a player now, and would so many people listen and be as touched, as when Jesse Jackson gave his eulogy for Jackie Robinson?For that matter, will there ever be another sports figure even half as important as Jackie Robinson?

I missed the boat on the first couple of White Stripes CDs and was fully prepared to hate them when I bought ELEPHANT--talk about a boatload of hype being forced down down your throat by Rolling Stone and every other out-of-touch music rag--but after four straight days of listening to ELEPHANT at top volume, I am here to say that the White Stripes have got it going on.&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is getting the airplay, but the whole album rocks. Kind of like Sweet meets Smashing Pumpkins, with Guns &amp; Roses and the Spiders from Mars playing backup. I mean, they ROCK. There is a lot mure THUMP! to the White Stripes than your typical 21st century band; they appreciate big guitars and are a thousand times more creative than anyone else going right now.As far as I'm concerned &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine&quot; is thE Rock song of 2003, an absolute ass-kicker with some of the best singing I've heard by a guy on a Rock record since Kurt Cobain fled the scene. Jack White also plays guitar like Mick Ronson, and you can't beat that.The shortcoming of the White Stripes, as with a million other bands, is that they can't be hard and soft on the same LP. The lighter stuff here--and there isn't much--sounds forced, contrived. If the Stones, Beatles, Zep, Who, and other classic Rockers can point to one thing that sets them above most of the other bands that have attempted the crown since then, it is that they could play both sides of the coin--the Stones had &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; and &quot;Angie,&quot; the Who had &quot;Love Ain't For Keeping&quot; on the same LP as &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again.&quot;Jack White comes really close on &quot;I Want to Be The Boy...&quot;, and Meg White attempts some kind of subtlety on &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night,&quot; but it really just sounds like one of those blank-generation Goth things Concrete Blonde used to do. There comes a point when a singer needs to put across something deeper; when the White Stripes get to that point they will be a truly great band. I suppose the secret may be to keep Meg behind the drum kit while Jack stretches his vocal chops.

Quick, raise your hand if you thought Ringo would ever have a hit after the Beatles broke up.If you raised your hand, you're a liar. The general consensus was Ringo was old news the day McCartney kissed Lennon goodbye.But, in the first few years of the 1970s, it was Ringo churning out the hits. And they were some good ones.There are very few moments in Pop better than the kazoo solo on &quot;You're Sixteen.&quot; Some will say it only got in the air because it was on a record by a former Beatle. Maybe so. But I'm glad it hit the charts, because it's just plain fun.I love &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot; because it gives Ringo's drums room in the mix. A big drum sound, and a dirty mix.And, while &quot;Beaucoups Of Blues&quot; is here from Ringo's country experiment, I think his best singing is on &quot;Only You (And You Alone).&quot; That's good stuff, really tasty Pop.Ringo has always been easy to like. My understanding is that Lennon actually wrote &quot;I'm The Greatest&quot; (sounds like his lyric to me). But, if Lennon had stood on a chair and yelled &quot;I'm the greatest, and you better believe it, baby! The greatest in this world, in the next world, and in any world,&quot; as Ringo does, well, it would have had a very different effect, wouldn't it?

Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra doesn't appeal to me as much as his darker side does, there's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing, and the Voice delivered a tune--virtually any tune--better than jsut about anyone, save Ella Fitzgerald.And, while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me, &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; is perfection, &quot;It Happened In Monterey&quot; shimmys seductively, and Sinatra's quiet approach to &quot;Anything Goes&quot; is charming.

The Voice at it's purest. The old advice--buy any Sinatra album if he's wearing a hat on the cover--holds true here.On SONGS FOR YOUNG LOVERS, Sinatra rolls through &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;A Foggy Day,&quot; &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me,&quot; and the one of his all-time best, &quot;I Get A Kick Out Of You,&quot; egged on by the incredible Nelson Riddle. This is American popular Jazz at it's very best.SWING EASY, as the name implies, is even more swingin', though the tunes are not as well known as those on SONGS FOR YOUNG LOVERS. The highlight here is &quot;Just One Of Those Things,&quot; a sultry tune delivered with the kind of understated power that convinced a lot of younger listeners (I was once one of those) that Sinatra really was ThE Voice.

I was dissapointed in this book, written by the keyboard player for one of my favorite bands, the Faces. Like virtually every other book I've ever read by or about a rocker (small 'r', not Rocker, with a big &quot;r', which a good Mod would still take as an insult, I'm sure), ALL THE RAGE is little more than a litany of boozy gigs, plane trips, dull hangovers, and bad business deals.

My country embarasses me when it comes to music. Robbie Williams is making the best Pop records on the planet, and we're all focused on a 30-year old Grand Funk song being used in a motorcycle commercial.Ah well. What can you expect from a country that bought millions of copies of &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;?For me, &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot; is Williams best album. Frankly, it's taken decades for Pop to revive itself from the self-conciousness it took on in the late 60s and 70s, when it couldn't find a place relative to the more popular Rock of the day. Elton John and a few others were able to walk the line between Pop and Rock and make something worthwhile of it, but Williams seems to have found a way to make respectable Pop, Pop that draws from a lot of sources but remains, unapologetically, Pop.I could do without &quot;Rock DJ,&quot; but, other than that, it's hard to find fault with this record. &quot;Let Love Be Your Energy&quot; has hit written all over it, so does &quot;By All Means Necessary.&quot;But it's &quot;Supreme&quot; that makes this record and, for me, makes Robbie Williams. This is the target that Townshend and Springsteen have aimed for, a Pop record that talks to non-teens. I play &quot;Supreme&quot; loud, a lot, and I love it more every time I hear it. &quot;Supreme&quot; is a truly Great--that's G-R-E-A-T with a capital G--Great Pop Record.So wake up, America. You're missing the boat.

If you're like most anti-Joni's--a category I generally fall into--all you've heard is probably &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; and her idiotic whining at the Isle of Mann festival in 1968 (or was it the Isle Of Wight?)(the Isle of Long?)...anyway, you've bought into the image of Joni Mitchell as an over-rated egotist, who bought a folk guitar, had a few minor hit singles, and dubbed herself the new Coltrane.Well, most of that is true. Mitchell has always been her biggest fan, considering even her most inane ramblings some kind of holy experience.BUT, if you can set aside the personality and the ego, there are some true classics in her set. BLUE is one of them.Mitchell has spent the last twenty years trying to prove she's tough as nails, trying to take credit for everyone from Tom Waits to Jewel to even Dylan, so I imagine she'd hate to hear this...but her finest moments have always been when she lets down the butch facade and sings tender, almost girlish lyric--&quot;A Case Of You&quot; is heaven. BLUE is a near-perfect album.And, for those of you who still think Mitchell is only for women and wimps--why do you think Robert Plant wrote &quot;Going To California?&quot; The &quot;girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair&quot; was Joni Mitchell!

One of the most hyped albums of all time, and one of the very, very few to live up to it's advanced billing, BORN TO RUN marks the moment that Springsteen and the E-Street Band leapt from cult-status to a national phenomenon. 25 years later the album sounds as fresh and energetic as it did in the summer of '75.The album is an odd amalgam of bravado, vulnerability, mashismo and romance. There is such determination and desperation in Springsteen's characters on this LP: working all day, driving all night, teetering on the edge of some trap that they can't quite see but they can sure feel, all they talk about is getting out: &quot;It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win.&quot;The whole LP is about those years when you're getting old enough to set off on your life, but still feel all those adolescent fears and pangs. You're trying to set up the future while settling with the past--and what of the past can make it through with you to the future? What lives? What dies? The passion and pain in &quot;Backstreets&quot; is the most searing moment of Springsteen's early years: &quot;Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down--you can blame it all on me Terri, it don't matter to me now...I hated him. And I hated you when you went away.&quot;Springsteen has said he wanted to make an album that sounded like Phil Spector produced Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan-penned tunes. In the process he created a sound of his own, all leather and heat and sweat, that a whole host of acts tried to recreate throughout the late '70s and '80s. None of them ever matched the mark set by BORN TO RUN.One thing I've always wondered...on the cover, how did the diminuative Springsteen get in a position to be leaning onto Clarence Clemens shoulder?

While ZIGGY STARDUST will always be my favorite Bowie record, LOW and HEROES rank a close 2nd.What I find most impressive about LOW is that, unlike some of Bowie's later work and almost all of the second-rate 1980's techno-junk which LOW inspired, this synthed-up record retains some swing and some rythm.It also dulls me to tears to hear about Bowie's &quot;bravery&quot; in releasing these albums, as if there were some commercial risk involved. While he may have been stepping off stylistic cliffs, he gave himself great, nearly infallible parachutes by including great Pop singles on each LP. ZIGGY had &quot;Suffragete City,&quot; LOW has &quot;Sound and Vision,&quot; and HEROES had its title tune. They were all classic singles and, at the time, the market was still largely singles-based. Bowie may have been a challenging musician who liked to push the edges of the envelope, but he has always also been a smart businessman.

Mr. Stanley is correct in one--and only one--respect: Get Happy!!! is NOT R&amp;B.It is a fantastic approximation, and a perfect imitation. Sleeping through this album, with all due respect to other reviewers, is simply not possible.Elvis has said he was writing some of the lyrics for this album as the Attractions were laying down their tracks in adjoining studios. Either he's fibbing or he's even more of a genious than I already suspect. Lyrically (sp?) witty, musically groovin', a bass/drum/horn section that pounds without plodding--I simply cannot say enough about Get Happy!!!. I consider it one of the 20 or so best albums of the Rock era.The fact that Elvis, who had been considered kind of a runty, quirky annoyance by a lot of critics since his sophomore LP was released, could put together this album--and the accompaning tour, which was closer to the TAMI Show than the typical punk rockers he was so often compared to--is, to me, one of the miracles of the age.I'd love to pick out individual tracks and explain why I love this LP so much but, frankly, I don't know where to start. &quot;I Stand Accused,&quot; with it's &quot;I-S-T-A-N-D-A-C-C-U-S-E-D!&quot; finale? The heartache of &quot;Hi Fidelity,&quot; an ominous prelude to Elvis' later flirtation with C&amp;W? &quot;Riot Act,&quot; the ultimate finger pointer?I dunno. I lose all pretense of articulation when it comes to this great, great album. Buy it early, buy it often.

I'm generally not a fan of Greatest Hits packages--especially when they are padded out with &quot;new classics,&quot; a cynical marketing ploy that Kravitz has fallen for here--but this one is worth it.It works in this case because Kravitz makes hot singles but has yet to put together a solid LP. &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; is a blast, but it comes off an LP so full of holes I can't often bring myself to sit through it. By buying this repackage, you get the gems and avoid the filler that takes up so much space on the other LPs.As for critics of Kravitz, who say he &quot;sounds too much like Prince/Beatles/Hendrix/whatever,&quot; I don't get it. In the first place, he sounds nothing like the artists he's compared to. He's never tried to ape another artist, unlike Oasis, who have said flat-out that they are trying to remake Beatles LPs. In the second place, who would have ever thought that sounding like the Beatles or Hendrix would be considered a liability?The insertion of &quot;Again&quot; is annoying, but that seems to be the only way record companies are willing to release this type of package anymore. The whole &quot;instant classic&quot; marketing theme is cynical and stupid.

In addition to everything else you've heard and read about this CD, it has one of the most beautiful moments in all of Opera, &quot;Che Gelida Manina,&quot; from LA BOHEME, and one of the greatest pieces of classical music ever written, JUPITER.Some of the discotique pieces here are worthless, but &quot;Everybody's Free&quot; and those two recordings make just about anything else worth sitting through.

Along with KIND OF BLUE and 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT, STEAMIN' makes the argument that Miles Davis was the most influential Jazz men of the 20th century.Davis and Coltrane, joined here by Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Joe Jones, swing on STEAMIN', the most finger-snapping LP of the big three. Their version of &quot;When I Fall In Love&quot; is sublime.

The highlights of this LP--&quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; and &quot;Jackson,&quot; in particular--are so great that they nearly make up for they corny ballads in between. Nearly.A few more performances by June Carter, who growls like a bear on &quot;Jackson,&quot; and a little less dependence on sappy tear-jerkers from the Man In Black, and this would be a more listenable LP

I have loved everything to do with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD since the moment I saw the film, more years ago now than I care to remember.This CD proves what an integral part the score played in the film, and stands as one of the greatest soundtracks ever recorded. It is beautiful music which stands on its own, yet lent so much to the powerful feelings the movie brings out in so many of us.By the way--there has never, as far as I know, been a truly great movie made from a truly great book, other than TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.

Beyonce', marketed and produced to appear to be the new Janet Jackson, is a better singer than JJ by about a million miles.It is her marketing and production team that is crippling Beyonce's artistic arc. The marching-band-on-crack horns on &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; are fantastic, but the decision to drop in the now-obligitory ABAB rhyming of Jay-Z brings the record to a stumbling end. Even worse are the mumbled ramblings of P. Diddy (or P-Daddy or Puff Daddy or whatever silly name The Most Overrated Man In Show Business is going by these days) on &quot;Summertime.&quot; It could have been a nice record, but the King of Self Promotion killed it.Beyonce' needs to set aside the pseudo-Janet Jackson pretentions and kick the washed up rappers off of her records before I'll be able to take her seriously. If she must ape another musician, Diana Ross would make more sense. Beyonce' may have the pipes to pull it off.

Here's one of the reasons to avoid greatest hits/best of collections. These are some truly great tracks which have been savaged by some label-hired editor, who cuts large chunks off songs for no particular reason.Everbody should own a copy of &quot;Samba Pa Ti,&quot; by the way, one of the truly great guitar tracks, overflowing with delicacy and intensity. A truly erotic instrumental track.One of the best guitar solos in rock, on &quot;Black Magic Woman,&quot; can't be heard here though, because the studio hack whacked it off the version on this CD.Buy the original albums and hear the real deal. Columbia blew it on this one.

This is where Neil Young's lyrics began to lose some of their contrived weirdness and really hit home.&quot;I wanna live, I wanna give...it's these expressions I never give that keep me searching for a heart of gold. And I'm getting old.&quot;That pretty much sums up a point a lot of us get to in our late 20s/early 30s, doesn't it?So much of this album is about reaching that point where a decision must be made between good or bad, up or down, right or wrong. Much has been made of &quot;Are You Ready For The Country?&quot; and Young's turn away from Rock to Country music. To me, that is just one of the decisions Young struggles with on HARVEST, and a minor decision at that. He is fighting over his solo-mountain-man image and living a more social life in a band; trying to decide if traditional southern thinking makes any sense or if a full-blown step into 20th century civil rights philosophy is viable (&quot;The devil fools with the best laid plans&quot; in &quot;Alabama&quot;), and argues against the worst case results of 1960s drug culture.This is an album about reaching breaking points, about deciding which way to go at lifes crossroads.Or, as Young hinted at with the the albums title, it is about reaping what you've sown when it's time for the HARVEST.

My editor, who grew up in Texas and saw both Hank Williams and the young Elvis (pre-Army) live, assures me that Hank Snow is OK, but &quot;he couldn't carry Hank Williams shoes.&quot;I couldn't agree more. &quot;I'm Movin' On&quot; is an absolute classic, a tune that should be covered by more country AND rock bands. There's a lot of other good stuff here, too. I think Snow's version of &quot;A Fool Such As I&quot; is great, for instance.But, if &quot;Rhumba Boogie&quot; and &quot;The Gal Who Invented Kissin'&quot; (&quot;I don't recall her name but I do believe that gal should sit up high in the hall of fame&quot;) are considered &quot;essential recordings,&quot; you're talking about a second-tier talent at best.

Although it's a major lull between his epoch early period and has surprisingly strong recent years, LUCKY TOWN (and the even weaker HUMAN TOUCH) has a few great moments.Those moments tend to be the ones that put his weak (at least in comparison to the E-Street Band) backup musicians low in the mix. &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; could have fit seamlessly on TUNNEL OF LOVE. &quot;Book Of Dreams&quot; might have slipped onto TOM JOAD--sonically, anyway, thematically there is no similarity. But when this band gets loud, it's not a lion roaring, as the E-Street was. It's like a bag of glass and nails and rusty tin cans falling down a flight of stairs.All that aside, everyone should own a copy of &quot;Beautiful Reward,&quot; a song so brilliant, so full of the kind of light that Springsteen is able to find in life, that it's worth sitting through the first 9 tracks.

This, as far as I'm concerned, is thE highlight of David Bowie's career.While the 'concept' behind ZIGGY STARDUST is rather mundane--a rock star acts rock starrish--Bowie's willingness to experiment with form and Mick Ronson's fantastic guitar work turn what is essentially a group of overly wordy poems into an iconic piece of Rock.It's a slow start, though. "Five Years" muddles along for nearly five minutes with no real point and "Soul Love" never makes it's point either. "Moonage Dream" hits it's target from the get go (anyone who was lucky enough to see the Ziggy tour, or who has seen the Ziggy Stardust documentary knows what a powerful tune this was live). Ronson's guitar solo is incredible. And "Starman" is an absolute classic, a perfect piece of real 1970's Rock and, for my money, lightyears ahead of it's thematic sister song, the done-to-death "Space Oddity."The band kicks it up a step on "Star," "Hang On To Yourself," "Ziggy Startdust" and the killer hit "Suffragette City," one of the hottest guitar tunes to ever ride the American charts. Ronson is on fire for the second half of the LP, and thank god Bowie was smart enough to step out of the way and let Ronson go wild. Between those hot rythm guitar parts, Ronson's wild lead, and the best horn section this side of the Beatle's "Savoy Truffle," "Suffragette City" sounds like your highschool marching band jamming with Alice Cooper.ZIGGY STARDUST also sports one of the greatest covers in Rock history; seeing it shrunk down to a 3x3 CD cover makes me wish LPs had never been supplanted by digital technology.

The curse upon the Rolling Stones appears to be that the pinnacle of their musical creativity, from 1968-1974, is overshadowed by Altamont.The irony, of course, is that while the Stones and some others are to blame for shoddy planning, based more on naivite' than anything else, it was the Hell's Angels who took it upon themselves to beat, intimidate and, finally, murder concert-goers. As GIMME SHELTER documents, the Angels were asked to sit on the stage, to form a human wall between the crowd and the performers, in exchange for all the beer they could drink. They took this to mean they were to keep the crowd at bay, using fists, hobnail boots, pool cues, and knives.In the end it was the Hell's Angels, a group of thugs who had never bought into flower-power and the entire hippy trip, who brought the 60's tumbling to a frightening and embarassing finale'.Jagger, like the Dead and Jefferson Airplane before him, seems meak and confused at Altamont, while good ol' Keith Richards attempts to take control of the situation.JAGGER: &quot;People! People! People, people, people, people, people. People. People! Awright. Awright...people!&quot;RICHARDS: &quot;If those cats, right there, don't stop beating everybody, we're not playing anymore. Those cats, right THERE.&quot;Almost forgotten in all the pop-sociological writings about this film is the great, great music. The Mick Taylor version of the Stones was as powerful as it gets, and they flex some muscle here.My only question is, why weren't Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor allowed to speak on camera? Jagger and Watts speak frequently, Richards speaks occasionally (mostly on stage at Altamont), Taylor is shown only occasionally, and Wyman is seen on screen, I think, one time, in the background on stage.

It's no wonder that the Stones aped Slim Harpo on so many of their early records: they were slaves to the groove and had a truly thumpin' bass player; Harpo's records were all about the groove, usually led by a great bass line. The Stones version of&quot;Hip Shake&quot; on the classic EXILE ON MAIN STREET is a near perfect copy of the Harpo version found on this record.The sound on these recordings is excellent. How a little label like Excello, recording low-budget acts in the (relatively speaking) middle of nowhere could capture such a great sound is beyond me.

It's hard to think of a better Pop single than &quot;I Think I Love You.&quot; I was in 3rd grade when it hit the charts in 1970, I saw the effect David Cassidy's voice had on 3rd grade girls, and all I can say is I was one jealous 9-year old.Then you watched the show and thought Keith Partridge seemed like too likeable a guy to hold much of a grudge. Speaking as someone who played guitar in grungy punk/hard rock bands, idolized Jimmy Page and Pete Townshend, and thinks Keith Richard is the best thing that ever happened to Rock'n'Roll, I'm happy to admit I loved the Partridge Family.Which means I loved David Cassidy's voice, because that's what this is all really about. Don Kirchner and all the rest of the RSO machine can try to take credit for the Partridge Family, but without Cassidy's sterling vocals, &quot;I'll Meet You Halfway&quot; would have been a b-side on some long-forgotten Association single.I was stunned by the live version of &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; taken, I suppose, from the long string of one night gigs Cassidy did during his last few months on the TV show. It's a little sloppy, but gives a hint at what Cassidy always argued he should be doing.This is not a great LP--there are more duds than hits here--but everyone should have their own copy of a piece of pure Pop joy like &quot;I Think I Love You.&quot;

The Last Great Rock album, by the Last Great Rock Band, NEVER MIND opens with the Last Great Rock Single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; It is a moment that changed the sound of popular music as surely as SGT PEPPER or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or THRILLER did, and it's effect on pop culture, now going on 10 years, has been as lasting as it's predecessors.Kurt Cobain was a great guitar player, a great song writer, and a fantastic singer, but his true genius was finding a way to blend the previously untamed punk/grunge sound he heard all around him with a Pop format. The result, found most purely on NEVER MIND, was a hybrid more powerful and energetic than anything since LONDON CALLING, more than a decade earlier.Cobain's curse, of course, was obsessive self-criticism and self-doubt. What other cerebral rocker would have written (and sung at length) &quot;I think I'm dumb&quot;? He wasn't dumb, not by a long shot, and I mark his death as the end of Rock.This is a stunning album, from start to finish. The decade past and the imitators that have filled it haven't dated this LP; their short-falling attempts only prove what a massive force Nirvana was.Listen to &quot;Come As You Are&quot; and try to think of anything on it--a single word, a single note--that you could change to improve it. Listen to &quot;Breed&quot; and try to come up with a more energetic sound you've heard lately that wasn't a thinly-veiled copy of this very record.Most of all, listen to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; If there has been a better explanation of what it is to be young and cornered recorded in the last 20 years, I haven't heard it.

A truly great album.There are four absolute classics here, songs and performances so great that it just gives you chills: &quot;I'm Still In Love With You,&quot; &quot;The Mountain,&quot; &quot;Dixieland,&quot; and &quot;Pilgrim,&quot; along with two very good instrumentals and a batch of other fine tunes.Earle has said this was a work of inspiration, and it is a sustained inspritation at that. Like the best of Springsteen or Tom Waits, THE MOUNTAIN speaks of place and time without being a hokey concept album. The characters come from hard times and, like those on Springsteen's NEBRASKA, they sometimes fall--into dispair, drunkenness, jail.But unlike NEBRASKA, where some characters seemed to find no way out, Earle's coal minors and irish immigrants see a light on the horizon. They find pride and honor in their hard work, in their civil war soldiering, in their lost loves.The Del McCoury Band is rock solid, swingin' and singin' with a confidence you only find in a band that has played together for a thousand years. Iris Dement is perfect; her duet with Earle on &quot;I'm Still In Love With You&quot; is achingly sweet. Emmylou Harris appears here and there--I think there is some law that says Emmylou Harris must sing backup on every bluegrass record now--and a whole host of country singers join in the chorus of &quot;Pilgrim.&quot;But this is Steve Earle's record. I had a lot of trouble stomaching some of his earlier records, but THE MOUNTAIN is so good that I'm willing to rethink it all. Nobody could make a record this great unless they have true heart, true soul, and a true love for bluegrass, country, blues--American music in general.This is, without a doubt, one of my absolute favorite records of the last 20 years.

The music, like the philosophy, is meant to energize through calm.It works.Invigorating, soothing, inspiring, relaxing. I don't mean to overstate this, but I GET IT when I listen to this CD.On a lighter note, am I the only person who notices a stunning resemblance between Krishna Das and the former shock-jock, the Grease Man? I know it's like saying Moses and Bozo the Clown look like brothers, but there you are.

Like ROUGH MIX, the album Townshend cut with Ronnie Lane, WHO CAME FIRST mixes a batch of unrelated tunes--some rejected by the Who, some Townshend didn't want to give the Who, and some surprising covers--and fuses them into a little gem of a record.&quot;Pure &amp; Easy&quot; is one of the best songs Townshend ever wrote. While I prefer the Who version on ODDS &amp; SODs, Townshend does a great acoustic version here. Lane takes the lead on &quot;Evolution&quot; which is...well, very Ronnie Lane-ish. Like your neighbor sitting on his back step with a guitar and a pint of Guiness.I love the sappy acoustic tunes &quot;Time Is Passing,&quot; &quot;There's A Heartache Following Me&quot; and, especially and always, &quot;Sheraton Gibson.&quot; Just great great great stuff from a period when Townshend could do anything--ANYTHING--on the guitar. The most intimidating wizard of all, in my book, even more so than Hendrix because Townshend never lost the beat in the midst of his revery (how's that for a poetic twitch?).And &quot;Content&quot; is almost angelic. Other than George Harrison I can't imagine anyone in Rock at the time (1972) who would have dared be this fragile and prostrate on a solo LP.For all his human shortcomings, Townshend remains my hero--guitar, spiritual, philosophical, whatever--and this album demonstrates the real heart of why that came to be. There are no hits, and that's really the point: this was a demonstration of a kind of faith, not an attempt to conquer Top Of The Pops.Later in the 70's Townshend would fight an internal battle to mix this kind of spiritual enlightenment with an urge to remain commercially viable; he would try to inject this kind of philosophical openness into a Rock/Pop Rock format. Whether or not he was successful--and whether or not that effort led, in part or in whole, to the creative collapse of the Who--is a wordy issued we can debate some other time.This is a great record,, though, no matter how you approach it.

Not a bad live LP, but certainly a let-down after TALK IS CHEAP.The main problem here, other than the inclusion of a couple of rather pedestrian tunes, is a drummer with the imagination of a worm. This may as well be a metronome. Contrary to popular belief, Charlie Watts is more than a time-keeper, and this band would have benefited from that kind of creativity.That said, this is still a quality LP, well worth having--AFTER you listen to the great TALK IS CHEAP about 1000 times.

I am not a Beach Boys fan.I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius--and I do mean genius--Brian Wilson was, and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.As much as I love &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album. &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day,&quot; &quot;Here Today,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; are all first rate Pop.PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track, &quot;Caroline No.&quot; It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric.

I've never been a huge fan of Norman Mailer--let's be frank, no one is a bigger fan of Norman Mailer than Norman Mailer--and this book did little to change that opinion.The first section of this book is exactly the kind of rhetorical meandering that gives intellectualism a bad name in some circles. Mailer spends so much time propping up his own semi-logical house of cards that he completely sidesteps the meat of the matter. Truth is lost in the dust. After a while, statements like "people who are wicked are always raising the ante without knowing quite what they're doing. Most of us are wicked to a good degree," start to sound like the blathering of Hawkeye Pierce in a sub-standard MASH episode.Part II, a critical analysis of American foreign policy in the Middle East, Arabia and Persia following 9/11, is right on the mark, though Mailer's refusal to give even the slightest benefit of the doubt to the Bush administration overwhelms some of his better points; his relentless ridicule of religion and patriotism of all kinds is also daunting, unfair and unfounded. I have a hard time granting much credibility to a man who writes "We violate Christianity with every breath we take. Equally do the Muslims violate Islam. We are speaking of a war then between two essentially unbalanced and inauthentic theologies." Mailer never hints at any argument to buttress this statement; it is simply stated as fact. To write off 60 percent of the world's population as spiritually irrelevant is bogus, to say the least.Perhaps most distressing is Mailer's increasing tendency to invoke an idealized past to support his arguments. Late in the book he complains that young children don't "read consecutively for an hour or two," as he says they used to. Again, there is nothing factual to support the statement. Odder still are the bizarre causes Mailer claims led to the supposed problem: TV commercials (not TV shows, just the commercial interruptions) and--get this--fluorescent lights in classrooms."What characterizes fluorescent light is that everybody looks 10 percent plainer than they do under incandescent bulbs...if everybody seems uglier than they are normally, why then, everyone naturally grows a little depressed."Oh brother.One of my usual complaints about Mailer is the length of his books: endless. Not so with "Why Are We At War," which I read cover to cover on my lunch hour. Eight bucks seems a little steep for 111 pages that appear to contain only a few more words than a NEW YORKER feature or a front page NY TIMES story with a jump.

Christopher Hitchens politics are often annoying--and occasionally bizarre--and his personality can be grating, to say the least.But man, can he write.He's a great thinker, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, his incredible brain has been turned off onto some weird side road, filled with illogical conspiracy theories, debunct claims, and unfounded, illogical, and slanderous accusations. His incredible mind has often been wasted forming a proposterous universe that simply doesn't exist.When he keeps himself on the plane of reality, he's a fascinating genius. He's been everywhere and done everything--though he seems to spend all of his time with crackpots and political hucksters--and he can tell a hell of a story. This is a fascinating book, when it steers clear of calling Mother Teresa names or referring to idiotic plots by Kissenger and Ghandi.Of course, one of the signs of Hitchens crackpot-genius is the fact that he has innoculated himself against criticisms like mine: I'm just a brainwashed victim of the worldwide conspiracy...

I hate this type of comparison, but here goes: if you took Wilco, made a young Tom Waits their singer, and forced them to stick to more traditional Blues-based forms, you'd have something akin to Eels.The subtitle of SHOOTENANNY!--&quot;Everybody Knows These Are Rock Hard Times&quot;--says it all. The album plays like a deep blue depression on a sunny day, pounding along across it's own unique aural landscape. Some of the more fatalistic stuff is hard to take repeatedly, but &quot;Saturday Morning&quot; is stunning and, while most of the rest of the album is sure-fire Alt Rock, there are moments towards the end, like &quot;Numbered Days,&quot; which have some kind of late 60s/early 70s atmosphere to them.SHOOTENANNY! has been in my short stack of CDs for a month now; it's inspiration may not be unique but the effect the Eels create is.

Finding non-judgemental explanations of man's different religious systems is a daunting task. This is the place. Although I'd like to find a more condensed version--actually going cover-to-cover here is a near impossibility--this is a valuable tool.

She is good. I mean, REALLY good.There's nothing here as Pop as Supernova; this is the stripped-down version of Phair. She turns the table on the traditionally accepted male-dominated rock and she matches them---unfortunaly, that sometims means she is as ugly and uncaring as the icons she (apparantly) wanted to expose.But she rocks. 6'1" is anthemic, nasty anthemic, and she just rolls from there.A great LP. Buy it.

Like so many others, I hunted down this CD after hearing the Kossoy's version of &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; in OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU and finding a different version on the soundtrack. It was worth the time it took to track it down.The whole CD has that early-morning haunt sound of &quot;I'll Fly Away.&quot; &quot;Bowling Green&quot; is great, as are &quot;Poor Ellen Smith,&quot; &quot;What Will We Do With The Baby O,&quot; &quot;The Darby Ram&quot; and, of course, the heartstopping &quot;I'll Fly Away.&quot;This isn't quite bluegrass; it's mountain music with one foot in pre-civil war English/Irish immigrant tunes. Great stuff.

The advice printed on my original vinyl version of this LP said &quot;Play In The Dark.&quot;That's really great advice, if you want to blow out your eardrums and end up in an insane asylum.This is interesting stuff, funky at times and earthy as hell, but man oh man, Yoko is just plain scary on this LP. Several tracks would be interesting, &quot;Why,&quot; for starters, if she'd just stop screaming over the mix.This is really more valuable to the collector of Beatle-ish stuff. Released as a sister-LP to Lennon's album of the same name, Yoko's PLASTIC ONO BAND serves only to point out that, while Lennon was stepping away from the Pop center, there was certainly a long way to go before he reached the outer limits.

Calling NOMAD &quot;surf music&quot; is short-changing the Aqua Velvets.Maybe if you're surfing in Moracco the label fits, but don't think of &quot;Surf Safari&quot; or Gidget flicks when you think of this fine LP. It shimmers and slides, tasty guitar licks and throbbing bass over a variety of rhythms and styles.

The characters from BORN TO RUN, so desperate and so self-assured that they were &quot;pullin' out of here to win,&quot; begin to run up against some walls on DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.The clouds on the horizon, which they sneared and scoffed at on BORN TO RUN, are much closer, much more dangerous, much more ominous on DARKNESS. There's still hope--&quot;keep pushing til it's understood and these badlands start treating us good&quot;--but, at least for some of these characters, hope o escaping the old home town is fading fast: &quot;Racing In The Streets,&quot; held up by so many novice Springsteen fans as some kind of NASCAR honorarium, is more about a deadend lifestyle than the glory of the greasepits:&quot;Some guys they just give up living and start dying little by little, piece by piece. Some guys come home from work at night and go racing in the street...&quot;Well, that sounds like every adolescent greaser's dream, right? But what happens to the girl he met at on the strip and took home like some trophy piece?&quot;There's wrinkles around my baby's eyes and she cries herself to sleep at night, and when I come home the house is dark...&quot;she sits on the porch of her daddy's house, but all her pretty dreams are torn. She stares off alone into the night with the eyes of one who hates for just being born.&quot;Obviously, the clouds on the horizion are full of rain. The storm blows even stronger on Springsteen's next album, THE RIVER, and the results of the flood are found in NEBRASKA.He is a novelist caught in Rock clothing.

Keep in mind this is a work of popular history, NOT some kind of legal, scientific, or historic document. If you want to learn how to make your own copy of Harrison's clock--as some other reviewers seem to imagine themselves doing--you need more than this.On the other hand, if you're looking for an interesting read about an oft-overlooked problem which was, despite one reviewers ravings to the contrary, one of the reasons Great Britain was able to forge an empire upon which the sun never set. Read LONGITUDE for what it is.That said, there is a problem with non-fiction: it doesn't often provide a storybook ending, and that is the case here. Harrison doesn't come away with a happing ending and live happily ever after, but fades and decays with time. Still, a satisfying read.

It's ironic, I think, that the Who's second LP had no standout hit tune, didn't do too well in the States, and doesn't have the kind of legendary status attributed to some of their later LPs, but may be the most influential of all Who records.The mix of R&amp;B instrumentation and pseudo-Beach-Boys harmonies popularized on this LP (and a whole series of Kinks records) still makes regular appearances on the UK and USA charts, &quot;A Quick One&quot; formalized the free-form style Cream, Hendrix and 10,000 lesser talents wore out in concerts during the late 1960s and 70s, and Paul Weller has spent his entire career trying to recreate the controlled mayhem of this LP.Sounds like a bad graduate thesis, don't it?When this record hit the popular conciousness of my highschool we wore it out in a year-long series of, shall we say, stimulating late night parties. It was the &quot;throw away&quot; stuff that really got us going: &quot;Run Run Run,&quot; &quot;Batman,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Bucket T.&quot;So there are no big whompin' &quot;My Generation&quot; type hit-anthems. But how can you resist a record where Pete Townshend announces &quot;we have a remedy little girl--I'm gonna make you feel alright,&quot; followed by Keith Moon's dead-on tom-tom and splash cymbol imitation of a steam engine?A QUICK ONE is a bit sloppy, but it's more of a fun 'party' record than anything else the Who ever did. I'll never set it on a pedastal with QUADREPHENIA or WHO'S NEXT, but it's still a very good record.

I've become totally disenchanted with American Pop over the last few years and World Beat is, for the most part, a marketing trap. It's easy to feel like you've got no choice but to drown in a sea of Oldies, if you follow me.But, every once in a while, a real gem floats before your eyes. GEDIDA is an incredible album, full of legitimate musical inventiveness unknown on U.S. radio for decades. The fact that a tune as great as &quot;Aqaba&quot; can't make a dent on even the so-called &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot; charts is further evidence that the American Pop scene is deader than dead. Blaming it on a language difference doesn't make it right, it only helps to articulate radio programmers deaf ears.Atlas has more imagination, a better voice, more of an artist's heart and, in all frankless, is more fun to look at than Madonna, Britney Spears, the comic Prince of Pop, or whoever the latest American marketing tool is who's ruling whatever charts people pay attention to.Once again, American radio misses the boat.

Think how great this album would have been if someone had bothered to produce it.With the exception of &quot;Undone&quot; and &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; most of these fine songs sound like they were recorded with a single microphone. It's just a dull roar, with the vocals completely lost in the mix and the drums barely audible.That said, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is an amazing song, an homage to nerdiness which--I can't believe I'm saying this--resulted in a great video. Ralph and Pottsy's reaction to the guitar break is classic.

I am convinced that Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love would have taken over the world if he had lived another 5 years. Beyond losing a muse (for whom she was also a muse), she seems to have lost her focus since his death, spending altogether too much time posing for magazine covers and going to Hollywood premiers.Which is a shame, because &quot;Miss World,&quot; &quot;Doll Parts,&quot; &quot;Plump,&quot; &quot;Gutless&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Rock Star,&quot; have more guts and bravado than 99% of the garbage you'll hear on so-called &quot;alternative&quot; radio.But Courtney Love has never been about fulfilling anybody else's expectations. So maybe my wishing she'd lose the high fashion and spend 6 months putting together a really killer LP is just more male-domination--just another example of the Man keeping Sisters down.I dunno.I just think she rocks.

Kurt Cobain's talent as a songwriter, singer, performer, guitar player, and as the visionary who saw a way to merge Punk and Pop cannot be overstated.The backbreaker on UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK, the tune which befuddled whatever rock-establishment stragglers who might still have doubted Cobain's supremacy, is &quot;The Man Who Sold The World,&quot; an old Bowie tune nobody else would have touched in the this format (by the way, ain't it galling that MTV pugs an &quot;unplugged&quot; label on acoustic Rock and then claims it invented the concept?&quot;). The riffs in the verse are interesting, but the fuzz-lead solo is just stunning. Who but Cobain would have gotten that soaring, roaring solo out of his acoustic?The better-known Nirvana stuff is great--&quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Dumb,&quot; and &quot;All Apologies,&quot;--but the tunes that got less airplay, like &quot;On A Plain&quot; and &quot;About A Girl&quot; are even better.

So where do I begin?The Beatles were the reason I picked up a guitar, the reason I fell in love with Rock, the reason I became a writer, the reason I pay attention to music, to film, to art and philosophy and on and on and on. They are thE standard by which I measure most things.Call me crazy.Lennon is the beatified Beatle, and this album is the touchstone for most conversation about him these days.Of course, when it was issued in 1971, it didn't really sound like Lennon. The piano was Lennon, the voice was Lennon, even some of the lyrics were Lennon. But in all honesty, Lennon usually came across a lot more angry than this. He was the one who got in Liverpool fist fights, he was the one going on 3-week drinking binges and getting thrown out of nightclubs in LA, he was the one waving his fist in the street, supporting the IRA and the Black Panthers. PLASTIC ONO BAND (also a great, great LP) is more representative of most of his thinking and work.That said, IMAGINE is an amazing song, a moment in time when Lennon seemed to click with the universe and see some kind of Nirvana on the horizon, one where fighting and drinking, and the IRA and the Black Panthers, wouldn't be needed.Part of it must have been stepping outside his Beatle life, but you must also remember the times. Harrison, Clapton, Winwood and a host of others were releasing music with a blatent spiritual bent. This is Lennons agnostic/athiestic spirituality album.Beyond the title track, which never gets old, even after the 50 trillion listenings I've given it, there are quite a few great tracks. My personal favorite is "Jealous Guy," although I always find myself wondering (as I do when I listen to McCartney's first solo LP) where did this guy learn to play such heavenly piano? In all the millions of words I've read about LeMac I've seen countless chapters explaining their guitar playing and how they were taught/picked up the instrument, but no mention of their piano lessons.I love "Oh Yoko." I know it's corny as hell, but I love the fact that Lennon could communicate the feeling of being in love like this. He's like a little kid here, so happy to be in love for the first time. And the next time somebody tells you it's too personal, that he shouldn't have stuck Yoko's name in his songs, ask them if they have the same opinion of "Michele."I like the Wall of Spector "Gimme Some Truth," particularly the way Lennon spits "No short-haired-yellow-bellied-son-of-tricky-dicky's-gonna-mother-hubbard-soft-soap me with just a pocket full of soap--it's money for dopes." That, and the attack on McCartney in "How Do You Sleep" prove that Lennon may have glimpsed Nirvana, but it was hardly within his grasp.ThE moment of the album, though, comes in the middle eight of "How?" where Lennon reconciles the peace&love; hippy and the angry young man in himself:"Life can be long and you've got to be so strong, and the world is so tough, sometimes I feel I've had enough..."Well, that simple statement says a lot, doesn't it? The world keeps pounding away at you, and it's hard to keep at it sometimes...But you've still got to keep at it.Like Woody Allen said, we do it because we need the eggs. Oops, that's supposed to be in my review of ANNIE HALL.Finally, there is the debate about IMAGINE. There are those who will tell you it is, somehow, the equivilent of the communist manifesto.Do us all a favor: Tell them they are stupid. Tell them to read a book.Lennon was a lot of things. He was never--NEVER--a finished product. He had the brains to look into different ideas, and the guts to voice his opinions, even when he knew they would be attacked. He was an emotional man, with some emotional problems, apparantly, who thought the world should, and could, be a better, less violent place. This album, and especially the title track, is simply his idea of what that non-violent world might look like. He wasn't calling for land redistribution, church-closings, or any of the other silly things that are so often attributed to him by those who favor book burnings and religious fundamentalism.He was, in fact, searching for heaven--heaven on earth, maybe, but heaven none the less.

There's an old maxim: if Sinatra wears a hat on the cover, the LP swings.He's wearing clown make-up on the cover of SINGS FOR ONLY THE LONELY. So don't be looking for swingin' dance tunes.This is an album to listen to alone, unfortunately. On the rocks, if you get my double meaning.For the casual listener, there aren't many familiar faces on this great LP, except for the masterful &quot;One For The Road,&quot; maybe the greatest saloon song of all time.He does it even better than Mary Richards.Sinatra understood this music better than anyone. It's not going to be great party music, or the kind of thing you want to listen to on a first date. But man oh man, can it rip your heart out.

Along with THE 500 HATS, THE KING'S STILTS, and the two Horton books, BARTHOLOMEW AND THE OOBLECK is part of a great suite of Dr. Seuss books for young readers.Longer and more involved than the Seuss books for pre-readers, these books help bridge the gap between a child being read to, and a child reading on their own.

Despite the hype (the anti-hype?)created by Jagger's decades-long refusal to release ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS, it hasn't been completely hidden all these years. The Who included their performance in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, and it's good enough to make the old story that the Who was too good for Jagger to let the tapes out seem credible.Jethro Tull, at that time just a bright blip on the rock and roll radar, are surprisingly good here. The live stuff they would release later was ponderous, but this is energetic and great.For me the highlight of this LP is The Dirty Mac, the Lennon/Clapton/Richards/Mitchell ensemble who throw off a wicked version of &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; for my money one of Lennon's ten best tracks. Lennon was only a few months into his truly classic independent period. This is great, great stuff.It is immediately destroyed, as was so often the case, by a lame bluesy jam and Yoko's incessant caterwauling. In later years Lennono did their best to say the B-52s, Lena Lovitch and others were inspired by Yoko's music. I tend to think only a rash of suicides and self-immulations could have been inspired by this kind of thing.The Stones, according to notes included with the audio-CD, performed thier set at something like 4 a.m.. Sorry kiddies, but it sounds like it.&quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; moves in slow motion. ThE live version can be found on GET YER YA YA'S OUT, recorded within just a few months of ROCK &amp; ROLL CIRCUS.&quot;Parachute Woman&quot; is better, much better than the studio version. Much of the rest of the set is good, though uninspired.&quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot; is great--it's one of the best things the Stones ever wrote--but is it really live? Looking at the video, and listening to the audio, I'm more convinced all the time that Mick &amp; Keith's vocals were recorded live over the studio-recorded tracks and backing vocals. Not that big a deal, I guess, but it says something about the sinceerity and authenticity hyped in the overblown CD liner notes.

Decades after it's initial release, THE COMPLETE BOOK OF RUNNING has become a classic and remains what it was Fixx intended it to be: a great guide for beginners and a textural gathering place for multitudes of runners.Some of the training tips have been overwhelmed by further study, and Fixx's recommendation to buy good running shoes has been slammed as the starting point for Nike's attempt to take over the universe, but the book is still inspirational to anyone looking for some kind of cultural backbone for what is, at it's core, the most individualist fitness activity.

Further proof that American's can't Rock: Ohio-native Chrissie Hynde had to go to London to find musicians to play her music.Luckily for her--and us--she found James Honeyman Scott, who flat out plays on this LP. Losing him was a disaster this band never quite got over; this is their only complete LP.Two of the tracks, &quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;Brass In Pocket&quot; became FM staples, but everything here is solid.Where did this band learn time signatures? There's a bit of 4/4 here, but what is &quot;Tattooed Love Boys&quot;?To me, &quot;Kid,&quot; with it's bass-string guitar riff, and the straight-ahead rocker &quot;Mystery Achievement&quot; are the best tracks here, but they are all solid. This is a can't-miss CD.

What gauled his 1992 Democratic rivals in the primaries, infuriated Ross Perot all summer long, belittled George Bush in the general election, and humiliated Bob Dole four years later, was Bill Clinton's seemingly effortless ability to out-campaign anybody. Say what you want about Clinton as President, as a campaigner he was absolutely invincible.THE WAR ROOM turns part of that perception on its head: the '92 Clinton campaign was anything but effortless. From the get-go, Carville and Stephanopoulus are scrambling to stay ahead of the scandal-a-day strategy the GOP used.Luckily for them, the Bush team focused on spinning rooms full of political reporters and forgot to campaign.If I could change one thing about THE WAR ROOM it would be to have spent more time with Carville. The Rajin' Cajun may annoy his opponents to distraction, but the man can talk, and he's the most successful campaign strategist of our time.

A true classic of American politics, THE WAR ROOM, like the Carville/Matalin book ALL'S FAIR, makes it abundantly clear why Clinton beat Bush in one of the most unwinnable elections of the last half century.To put it bluntly, Clinton and his campaign stayed in touch with the electorate and worked their tails off, while Matalin and the Bush campaign made weekly pronouncements about &quot;the people's will&quot; and through boozy parties for themselves.Perhaps most fascinating in THE WAR ROOM is the relationship between Stephanopoulos, Carville, and Clinton, the three-headed Republican-killing dragon from Little Rock by way of Manhattan. Like a good sports team they are simultaneously loose and intense, kicked-back and on-issue.

When DON'T TELL A SOUL was released I thought even American radio programmers couldn't continue to be stupid enough to ignore the Replacements. I was wrong. American radio programmers have a seemingly limitless capacity for short-sighted stupidity.Did the Mats sell out? Who cares? It's always been a stupid discussion, in relation to any band. Define &quot;selling out.&quot; Trying to be successful? I'm sorry, I guessed I missed it--when did the Mats decree that their goal was to be a flop? Did I miss the interview where they announced that they wanted to make music that nobody would listen to?All angst aside, there are at least three songs here that could have made the charts, and perhaps extended the life of this great band, if Sire had made a serious promotional effort and if American radio programmers hadn't made such an overwhelming effort to make the turn of the decade a wasteland of Hooty and the Blowfish and Huey Lewis dreck.By the way, next time you think DON'T TELL A SOUL is a sellout solely for Top-40 popularity, take a sec to listen to &quot;Anywhere Is Better Than Here,&quot; especially the first 5 seconds.Sound like a beaten band to you?

I won't pretend to be any kind of expert on Latin music, but I will tell you that Los Lobos certainly appears to be a lot more authentic than Ricky Martin or any of the other popl pablam being passed off as &quot;the new hispanic wave.&quot;This is the Los Lobos LP that convinced me, beyond any doubt, that they are the real deal. Their first album (WILL THE WOLF SURVIVE?) is an absolute classic, but they stumbled around for a bit after that. They did some good stuff, they did some junk, they seemed to lose direction.Then LA PISTOLA Y EL CORAZON was released, and they seemed to find their center. This is a wonderful record that makes me feel like I'm in El Paso everytime I hear it.Play &quot;La Guacamaya&quot; and especially &quot;Si Yo Quisiera&quot; loud.

Probably Roxy Music's least critically-lauded LP, FLESH+BLOOD has always been my favorite Roxy record.The covers--"The Midnight Hour" and "Eight Miles High"--are lame and dull, but if you strip them away and listen only to the Roxy originals, this is a fine LP.I rarely played side two of my old vinyl copy, because side one was just so great. "Oh Yeah," "Same Old Scene," "Flesh and Blood," (with a scorching guitar/synth riff) and "My Only Love" rank as some of the best music Roxy Music ever recorded.

The dissapointing bow-out from the greatest American band to never have a hit, ALL SHOOK DOWN has a few highlights.&quot;When It Began,&quot; &quot;Attitude,&quot; and &quot;One Wink At A Time&quot; would all have gotten some airplay and some time on the charts in a normal world. I love the honking sax on &quot;One Wink At A Time,&quot; it's just a shame that 250 million Americans weren't allowed to hear it and love it too.But please, radio programmers, don't be offended by my criticism. I'm sure everyone loved hearing &quot;Whip It&quot; and &quot;Hey Rickie&quot; 50 million times instead.

During the 1970s Stevie Wonder's success, both critical and commercial, was so great that it became monotonous and the butt of a thousand jokes. A standup comic's act wasn't considered complete unless he did at least one imitation of Wonder giving an acceptance speech in every set.All of the accolades Wonder received were deserved. The level of writing and playing--remember, Wonder played the majority of instruments on the majority of his hits--is a cut above anything else on the charts at the time. One reason people (like me) found it so easy to ridicule later Stevie Wonder records, like &quot;I Just Called To Say I Love You,&quot; is that his earlier work, most notably &quot;You Haven't Done Nothing,&quot; &quot;Living In The City,&quot; and &quot;Higher Ground,&quot; were just light years better.Wonder didn't treat &quot;Musiquarium&quot; with the flippant, toss-away mentality so often found in Greatest Hits/Best Of packages. The songs flow, one into the next, often merging seamlessly with not break in between. Like everything else he did in the 1970s, this is a quality LP worthy of high praise.

For someone like me who loves every note Django Reinhardt ever played this 4-CD collection and another 5-CD set also available on Amazon, "Django Reinhardt: The Classic Early Recordings in Chronological Order," are the Holy Grail. Between the two sets I can load up the CD player with 9 discs and listen to this most unbelievable of all guitar players show off for hours at a time.There is more swing, more fun, and more incredible guitar playing on these discs than you'll ever hear anywhere else.Even though they contain no lengthy linear notes, 'free booklets,' posters, etc., these are, without a doubt, the greatest multi-disc box sets I have ever heard.

As much as the Beatles were loved in the USA, we were short-changed. We thought we were getting a lot with an album every ten months, a handful of singles each year, a movie every two years, an occasional tour, and a sloppy Saturday morning cartoon.But, in the UK, the Beatles were doing stage shows--not just their own act, but pantomime and vaudeville-type things--and tons of live radio, where &quot;From Me To You&quot; was converted to &quot;From Us To You&quot; and made their signature tune. LIVE AT THE BBC collects more than 60 of the best moments from their radio appearances in one fabulous package.There are a couple odd glitches--the solo on &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is an obvious edit of the studio solo patched over a live performance, for instance--but the vast majority of the music here is superb.The cover of &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; is fantastic, really hard stuff the way Lennon always said he preferred the Beatles to sound. Harrison shines on &quot;Nothin' Shakin'&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Tryin' To Be My Baby.&quot; McCartney wails on &quot;Long Tall Sally,&quot; &quot;Lucille,&quot; and &quot;The Hippy Hippy Shake.&quot; The whole band delivers a jolt with my very favorite early Beatles rocker, &quot;Some Other Guy.&quot;Ringo, as always, is the heart of the Beatles sound. On &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; he sounds like he's going to knock the bandstand to pieces. Why he isn't universally acclaimed as one of the 2 or 3 greatest Rock drummers of all time is beyond me.This is a great record of the Beatles early days, when they were just beginning to step away from a very 1950s sound. Who could have guessed how far they'd go in less than a decade?

It's a fascinating topic--how do you create a unit of measurement for that most elusive of all illusions: time?But it's not all that fascinating of a book. I'm not a big fan of non-fiction books loaded down with hypothetical meanderings--the purely fictional fairy tale of a &quot;cro-magnon Francis Bacon&quot; is simply embarassing to read--and even the recitation of facts is questionably at times.A fine concept, but there's a lot left to be desired on the follow through.

While I'm a long time fan of Dylan Thomas's prose and poetry, I've never understood the fascination with this sloppy, non-sensical play.It is, to me, a moment when Thomas stopped being Thomas and made a clumsy attempt to emulate James Joyce. The result is a confusing and pointless play.That said, the man was a marvel. Read his poetry, read "Adventures In The Skin Trade" and "Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Dog."

I think Willie Nelson has to be seen live to be truly understood. I know I was converted from a Rock purist to a Willie Nelson fan after seeing him live in 1980. A great songwriter, expressive singer, and world-class guitar player, he was finally able to communicate it all to a mainstream audience with his 1975 release, RED HEADED STRANGER.Oddly enough, it is an album that hashes and rehashes the same simple melody repeatedly, employs the same basic instrumentation throughout, and tells and retells the same story over and over--but never grows old or wears thin. There are 3 versions of &quot;Time Of The Preacher Here,&quot; but it works, just as it worked when Nelson did &quot;Whiskey River&quot; 3 times at the 1980 show.&quot;Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain&quot; is a classic performance and, I think, the first time Nelson's fantastic nylon-sting picking was heard on a charting single. He is the most underrated guitar players of the last 45 years, bar none. I've often thought I'd pay a premium for an insturmental Nelson album, nothing but guitar solos.&quot;Can I Sleep In Your Arms Tonight&quot; is even better. There is a purity here, a clarity of vision and a confidence Nelson has in his own artistic voice, that was simply unheard of in country music in the mid-70s.To me, RED HEADED STRANGER is second only to STARDUST in the Willie Nelson catalog.

Greenfield's book is particularly valuable for anyone who keeps an eye on the political world. She points out, accurately, sharply, but in what I can only call a courteous manner, that politics is filled with hypocrites, charlatons, and ignoramouses.Pretty much like the rest of the world.

This is a fine book, but a warning: having been written by Brits for Brits, it is (understandably) Anglo-centric. Unless you are planning on covering the Coventry city council or writing up scorecards for Cricket matches, this book may not be for you. Yanks should search out an American alternative.

There has never been a better Pop single than &quot;Be My Baby.&quot;Period.The pleasant surprise is that Phil &amp; Ronnie kept a pretty high standard when it came to singles. This album is solid from beginning to end.There are a batch of minor classics here, including &quot;Why Don't They Let Us Fall In Love,&quot; &quot;Baby I Love You,&quot; and the down right dirty &quot;(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up.&quot; The Ronnettes made records that weren't just about teen love, first love, they made records that felt like teen love.There are some odd bits. &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; doesn't sound uptempo, it sounds spastic, and the &quot;shadoop-shadoop&quot; intro to &quot;Everything Under The Sun&quot; sounds like one of those lousy &quot;Sing-a-long With Mitch&quot; albums they used to hawk on TV.But any album that contains &quot;Walking In The Rain,&quot; an absolute masterpiece of songwriting and record production, sung by angels like Ronnie Spector and the Ronnettes, is worth having on your shelf.

David Dalton's linear notes are so out of whack with reality--he basically claims that this was a succesful attempt by the Stones to save Rock and Roll through a self-sacrificing bow to harmony and generational unity--that my first reaction was to scoff at this LP.But I'd heard so much about it over the years, thanks to the myth created by Jagger's decades-long refusal to release the tapes, that I just had to hear it. And, Dalton's hyper-spin aside, it is a fine, though flawed, LP.It hasn't been completely hidden all these years. The Who included this version of &quot;A Quick One&quot; in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, and it is good enough to make the old story that the Who was too good for Jagger to let the tapes out seem credible.Jethro Tull, at that time just a bright blip on the rock and roll radar, are surprisingly good here. The live stuff they would release on their own later is ponderous, this is energetic and great.The Marianne Faithfull tune stands out like a sore thumb, kind of a bad Sandy Denny imitation. I never understood how Faithfull had any hits, prior to BROKEN ENGLISH, it all sounds like tripe to me.For me the highlight of this LP is The Dirty Mac, the Lennon/Clapton/Richards/Mitchell ensemble who throw off a wicked version of &quot;Yer Blues,&quot; for my money one of Lennon's ten best tracks. This is the only moment on this CD where Dalton's claims of some historical significance make sense. Lennon was only a few months into his truly classic independent period. This is great, great stuff.It is immediately destroyed, as was so often the case, by a lame bluesy jam and Yokos incessant caterwauling. In later years Lennono did their best to say the B-52s, Lena Lovitch and others were inspired by Yoko's music. I tend to think only a rash of suicides and self-immulations could have been inspired by this kind of thing.The Stones, according to Dalton's notes, performed thier set at something like 4 a.m.. Sorry kiddies, but it kind of sounds like it.&quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; moves in slow motion. ThE live version can be found on GET YER YA YA'S OUT, recorded within just a few months of ROCK &amp; ROLL CIRCUS.&quot;Parachute Woman&quot; is better, much better than the studio version. Much of the rest of the set is good, though uninspired.&quot;Salt Of The Earth&quot; is great--it's one of the best things the Stones ever wrote--but is it really live? Looking at the video, and listening to the audio, I'm more and move convinced all the time that Mick &amp; Keith's vocals were recorded live over the studio-recorded tracks and backing vocals. Not that big a deal, I guess, but it says something about the sinceerity and authenticity Dalton tried so hard to sell in his notes.

For whatever reason, original Kinks LPs are increasingly hard to find. Best Of/Greatest Hits compilations are getting to be few and far between as well--grab this one and KINK KRONIKLES asap.Some of the tunes on this CD have been played to death on oldies radio, but much of the early stuff--especially &quot;All Day And All Of The Night&quot;--are so great they overcome radio programmer dysfunction with flying colors.&quot;You Do Something To Me&quot; is one of the catchiest things to never chart in the US. Sounds like a second single from the O-Needers. Oops--I mean the Wonders.There's a series of singles, from what was once considered the Kinks middle period but must now be called they're late-early period (?), including &quot;A Well Respected Man,&quot; &quot;Stop Your Sobbing,&quot; &quot;Dedicated Follower Of Fashion,&quot; and &quot;Sunny Afternoon,&quot; which are among the greatest songs of their time. Too bad the Kinks were labeled &quot;too English&quot; by block-headed American radio programmers of the day.

Wow, is the Editorial Review ever off the mark here.The 3 greatest live albums of all time are the Who's LIVE AT LEEDS, Bob Marley and the Wailers' LIVE, and the Rolling Stones GET YER YA-YA'S OUT.The Stones are all power, vim &amp; vigor on this LP. Mick sings, instead of screaming as he does on some of their other live LPs. Wyman &amp; Watts are rock solid as always, and Keith runs the band, as he seems to do in all of their best moments.What makes this a classic album instead of just a very good live LP is Mick Taylor, who is just crushing throughout, a dominating guitar player. Am I the only one who thinks the Stones were at their best during the brief period when Taylor played guitar with them?&quot;Stay Cat Blues,&quot; &quot;Love In Vain,&quot; and &quot;Live With Me&quot; are all better here, much more rocking, than the studio versions.For me, the highlight here is &quot;Midnight Rambler,&quot; which I could argue is the best thing the Stones ever recorded. From the opening strains, with the crowd doing some off color chant, the chugga-chugga guitars and multiple time changes make this a true Rock classic, best played EXTREMELY LOUD. The responses from the crowd, during the slow section toward the end, give me chills.I love this LP. I don't know that I would consider the Stones a first rate Rock'n'Roll band if they hadn't released GET YER YA YA'S OUT.

How did he do it?How did Lou Christie take a format which could so easily have slipped into the absurd--the 1950's arrangements, the adolescent lyrics, the falsetto--and turn out so many Pop classics?&quot;The Gypsy Cried,&quot; &quot;Two Faces Have I,&quot; &quot;Summer Snow,&quot; &quot;Outside The Gates of Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Trapeze&quot; are all great; &quot;Lightnin' Strikes&quot; would have been a tight fit on a Ronettes LP, and &quot;Shy Boy&quot; out Beach-Boys the Beach Boys.But there's still some junk here. &quot;Self Expression&quot; sounds like a bad Saturday morning cartoon theme. &quot;Back to The Days of The Romans&quot; is so bad it hurts, and I could do without the self-referential &quot;Mr. Tenor Man&quot; too.The bad stuff tends to come from the last days of Christie's recording career, the mid to late 1960s, but one of my favorite Christie singles, &quot;I'm Gonna Make You Mine,&quot; was actually recorded in 1969. It was a classic, CLASSIC 45, and it sounds even better all these years later on a clean CD. It was the perfect blend that Christie had seemed to strive for all during the 1960s, sounding like Franki Valli backed by the Ronettes; a catchy melody and a decent backing band.Anyway, everyone should own this CD, because EVERYBODY secretly loves to sing along with the falsetto on &quot;The Gypsy Cried&quot; when they hear it in their car.Admit it.

While the topic of liberal bias is interesting and--like conservative bias, environmental bias, American bias, corporate bias, male bias, yadda yadda yadda--occasionally evident, Goldberg has done a poor job of discussing it.BIAS is self-serving, to say the least; it's author is also irritatingly self-absorbed. The whole book can be paraphrased as 'I, Bernard Goldberg, the only straight-thinking and non-biased journalist ever, spent many years telling my wild-eyed liberal bosses that they were evil and bent, but they were too stupid to recognize my obvious genius.'Perhaps most discouraging, Goldberg mentions only in passing in the book's forward that nearly all talk radio, a growing number of cable networks and FOX News in its entirety are blatently and overtly conservative; he then spends the 234 pages whining about instances of vaguely perceived liberal bias on the big three networks--particularly the network that refused to make him evening news anchor, by the way--and concludes that Americans are being misled by the Left.Hogwash.Another favorite topic of the new edition is how those horrible liberals refused to interview Goldberg about the first run of BIAS. He even ridicules networks and programs that never talk about bestsellers, because they didn't make the exception for his oh-so-important tome. Paragraph after paragraph is devoted to the supposed shut-out until--finally--Goldberg gets around to mentioning that he DID get to hype his book on the TODAY show. But that's not good enough for him either: it was only "a dog and pony show."If you're looking for books about journalism and the problems you'll encounter in the business, look around. There are some good ones.Skip BIAS, though. It is nothing more than the whining of a frustrated man who, to be perfectly blunt, is not quite as smart or nearly as unbiased as he obviously believes.

ON WRITING convinced me of three things: Stephen King writes creepy stuff because he is a bit creepy himself, Stephen King is a much better writer than a lot of us ever have been willing to admit, and Stephen King would make one hell of a fine teacher.I learned more from this book than I can say. It is entertaining and, for writers at least, inspiring. Like all good teachers--and all good writers, for that matter--King knows how to strip away the adverbs and the clutter, leaving a clean story and a clear idea.

You'd have to be a longtime Moon Mullican fan to get much real enjoyment from this CD, which comes with no liner notes of any kind and includes a few clumsy editing jobs."Jambalaya" is embarrassingly bad and had me worrying that I'd stumbled across yet another 3rd-rate Hank Williams copy cat. The real Moon Mullican is shown off better on traditional C&W; sides like "So Long" and his later Blues influenced stuff like "I'm Mad With You," "Well Oh Well," and the truly rockin' "Seven Nights To Rock," which Bruce Springsteen covered on his 2003 tour.

A funny little LP, weighed down with junk, BAD HABITS still boasts a couple of nice tracks and one classic instrumental.Though much of the album is made up of clumsy novelty records, &quot;Love In Stereo&quot; is a legitimate Pop song. It's almost ruined by that 1980s &quot;new wave&quot; keyboard sound, but manages to pull itself together anyway. &quot;Nice Legs Shame About The Face&quot; is a decent Pub-Rock tune, based on an age-old pub phrase, and &quot;I Ain't Gettin' Any&quot; is similar.And then there's &quot;Skylab (Theme From The Monks).&quot; This instrumental absolutely sweapt thru my college dorm--I made sure of it by playing it monstrously loud at all hours of the day and night--and was a staple on the local alternative radio station for a while. Finding this pseudo-Ventures classic at the end of this LP is like finding a diamond ring at the bottom of your Cracker-Jack box.Calling this a Punk album is a bit of a stretch, though. The Monks are to the Sex Pistols as the Rutles are to the Beatles, if you follow me.

To those of us coming from a more Pop point of view this CD sounds like a ruralized Les Paul--lots of flash and a 2/2 beat.The never-ending debate about which cubby hole to stuff Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant into (are they Country? C&amp;W? Jazz? Country Jazz? Pop Country? yadda yadda yadda?) is less than interesting to me. Whatever it is they're playing, I like it.&quot;Stratosphere Boogie,&quot; &quot;Arkansas Traveler&quot; and &quot;Flippin' The Lid&quot; are the highlights for me. West/Bryant understood the difference between showing off by picking at 1000 miles an hour and delivering a tune with a pit of flash and panache.

Today's McCartney would never stand for the release of this LP, effectively a group of demos and run-throughs by Macca and his just-formed band Wings.I kind of like &quot;Mumbo,&quot; though it doesn't stand up to frequent listenings, and I find it very hard to get &quot;Bip Bop&quot; out of my head. Drop the Bing Crosby-ish intro from &quot;Wild Life&quot; and it would be OK. &quot;Some People Never Know&quot; could have fit onto RAM or even LONDON TOWN.But &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; is cocktail lounge reggae, and &quot;I Am Your Singer&quot; is just garbage. It's more melodic than LennOno's first couple projects, but it's the same self-indulgent junk. And &quot;Dear Friend&quot; is just a nightmare, poorly sung, poorly written, and pointless.The inclusion of three extra tracks on the CD helps, a little. &quot;Oh Woman Oh Why&quot; sounds like the rest of the LP; &quot;Little Woman Love&quot; has more of the energy and inventiveness of RAM. &quot;Mary Had A Little Lamb,&quot; probably the most ridiculed single of McCartney's career, is just as good today as it was in 1971. Only Mac could pull it off, and it's so much better than his critics would have you believe.

I ordered this without knowing exactly what it was--so I have nobody to blame but myself.There are no liner notes or any other explanation accompanying this disapointing CD. There are several songs recorded by &quot;Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers,&quot; the first of which is labeled as having been recorded in 1996. There are a bunch of songs--mostly Wings-era McCartney songs--performed by &quot;Denny Laine &amp; Wings.&quot;Here's what I've deduced: this is a poorly recorded set from some gawd-awful &quot;Beatlefest&quot; type of event. You know, one of those things where there is no sign of the real Beatles, but a bunch of people who have based their lives on memorabilia pay top dollar to watch people who look vaguely like the fab four, or played with them in the mid-70's, o recorded a couple really awful singles with them nearly 40 years ago, play.The music on this CD is horrible. Sheridan couldn't sing in 1962; by 1996 it was just embarrasing. Denny Laine sounds drunk and sleepy, and it is flat out pathetic that a man with the talent he displayed in the Moody Blues and with Wings now religates himself to being some kind of McCartney wanna be. He--and McCartney's material--deserve better.And, oh yeh, there's the obligatory 3-minutes of 1963-ish radio interview of Lennon, McCartney and Starr. No explanation of where Harrison is, and nothing you ahven't heard a thousand times before.

Raul Malo has the best voice in Country, bar none. Bar none.Here's how good this album is: I listened to it for two years, under the impression that it was a &quot;Best Of&quot; CD. It's not. It's just over-loaded with great, great Country singles, including a beautiful cover of Springsteen's &quot;All That Heaven Will Allow,&quot; a heartbreacking &quot;O What A Thrill,&quot; and the traditionalism of &quot;What A Crying Shame.&quot;For people like me, who find so much modern Country music a bad joke and a slick marketing tool, The Mavericks are a revalation. They aren't stupid, they aren't slick, they aren't a hair band or a hat band.They are, simply, a great band.

Maybe not as intimate as SINATRA AND SEXTET, SINATRA AT THE SANDS makes up for by presenting the entire show from one of the pinnacles of Sinatra's multi-faceted career: the Vegas years.The Voice is in prime order, and the tunes, with a couple of exceptions, are the romantic, victorious Pop of Sinatra's golden age. The vocal-horn interchange on &quot;I've Got A Crush On You&quot; gets funnier with repeated listenings; the saloon song of the night--Sinatra calls it a &quot;drunk song&quot; here--is &quot;One For My Baby,&quot; which I've always considered thE signature Sinatra tune. He handles it masterfully here.I still like Mary Richards version best, though.As for the patter, I could do without some of it, but what the heck--at this point, 35 years down the road, it's kind of nice to have this kind of thing documented. If you've heard the Rat Pack tapes and know some of Dean Martin's act, some of Sammy Davis Jr's act, you know the three were really in each other's pockets and were borrowing material back and forth quite a bit.

Motown was still &quot;The Sound of Young America&quot; and Wonder was only just stepping out from under the &quot;Little Stevie Wonder&quot; nickname when his first Greatest Hits package was released in 1968, but he had already demonstrated enough of the multi-talent genius that would make him one of the true giants of popular music to fill the album with great, great records.There are some of the classic Motown singles from his early days---&quot;Contract on Love&quot; and the incindiary &quot;Fingertips&quot; (has there ever been a more electric live recording? I love hearing the piano player trying to figure out what key Wonder's harmonica solo is being played in)---and a whole mess of songs from his incredible mid-60s stretch: &quot;Uptight,&quot; &quot;I Was Made To Love Her,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;A Place In The Sun.&quot;Buy this CD, GREATEST HITS VOL. 2, and both volumes of ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM to build an overview of one of America's true musical geniuses.

You can hear a virtual reproduction of this CD--the same worn out tunes, the same asleep-on-their-feet performances, everything--by walking into any bar in America tonight at 11:30. Marriott's voice isn't particularly interesting on SING THE BLUES LIVE, everything is played at half-tempo, and the production is just atrocious. On top of all that, this album features one of the worst drumming performances in recorded history.But SING THE BLUES LIVE may have been good enough for Marriott and the DTs, who seem to have been aiming low: according to the liner notes Marriott earned the respect of peers and critics by merging the hard rock sound of Humble Pie with vocals that "could have passed for a black R&B; singer." Is this supposed to be praise? Merging the sound of a hype machine with any vocals--particularly the bad vocals on this CD--haven't earned my respect, and it won't get yours either.(And, by the way, if you're looking for vocals that can pass as those of a black R&B; singer, why not check out some black R&B; singers? Rumor has it they all sound authentically black.)

I was less than thrilled by the film, which was downright boring at points, but the soundtrack is fantastic.This band (Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud) doesn't imitate Buddy Holly's sound, at times they actually improve on it. &quot;Rave On,&quot; &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; and &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; give Holly's Rock'n'Roll sides a run for their money. This is truly great stuff.Other tunes, particularly &quot;True Love Ways&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Love You Too&quot; don't quite make the mark. Busey's voice works on the uptempo stuff, but he has trouble on the ballads.&quot;Maybe Baby&quot; is so good here it gives me chills.

Like the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM, SANDINISTA finds a band at the height of its creativity taking on a myriad of musical genres and succeding on virtually every attempt.In 1980 straight guitar-bass-drums punk was going stale, and Dub, a reggae-rap music which introduced the idea of multiple-version releases to America, seemed ready to take the lead. Sandinista is, among other things, the Clash's big Dub LP. Those multiple versions required more vinyl, obviously. Strummer also took it as some kind of personal afront when Springsteen released the double-disc THE RIVER the same year, commenting that, if Springsteen released a triple-LP album, the Clash would respond with a quadruple-disc record.It is the Dub stuff that I enjoy most on SANDINISTA. &quot;Living In Fame&quot; and &quot;Silicone On Sapphire&quot; stand up to this day, something I can't say for &quot;Hitsville UK.&quot;The best moment, though, is the first: &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot; with Strummer spitting his lyrics. The Clash had a lot to say in 1980, and Strummer seemed to think even three discs might not hold it all.There is little I would change about this album. It is a monster, but a good one.

Michael Moore has said he made Fahrenheit 9/11 to force Americans to discuss the invasion of Iraq, and the greater war on terrorism, both of which which he felt had been rubber-stamped by Congress and rushed past the American people.It is impossible to argue that he has not reached that goal. If nothing else, note that there are nearly 700 reviews of this DVD on Amazon two months before it is to be released.Whether or not you agree with Moore's politics, you have to agree that he makes powerful films. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 in the theater about a month after it's release, when the Bush administration had had plenty of time to do all they could to discredit Moore and his film. The audience by then was small, but they CHEERED at the end of the movie.Fahrenheit 9/11 may be the best finger-in-the-eye-of-the-powerful you will ever see. It's also great film making.

What is it about English bands and double albums?An American band releases a double LP and you get--well, just think of Grand Funk Railroad and you'll understand where I'm going with this.Enlgish bands retreat from the stage for a few months and drop two-LP bombs on you like the Beatles WHITE ALBUM, the Clash LONDON CALLING, the Stones EXILE ON MAIN STREET, and XTC's ENGLISH SETTLEMENT.Yes, I do dare compare this LP to those classics.Andy Partridge was a wit from XTCs first LP, but his lyrics, sharpened by the release of BLACK SEA, are razors-edge cutting on ENGLISH SETTLEMENT.There are several great, GREAT tracks here, which deserve to be considered with some of rocks timeless records. &quot;Senses Working Overtime,&quot; &quot;Jason and The Argonauts&quot;, and &quot;All of A Sudden (It's Too Late)&quot; are downright cinamatic, stories that fly round the world--&quot;And all the world is biscuit shaped, it's just for me to feed my face, and I can see hear smell touch taste--that I've got one two three four five senses working overtime&quot;--it's sesame street lyric illuminating an adult world.For the uninitiated, XTC is a more British-sounding Beatles, to my ear. They are the Kinks during their most melodic phase, but with a more energetic and disciplined rhythm section.The fact that American radio turned a deaf ear to this LP is beyond belief, by the way. Released in 1982, ENGLISH SETTLEMENT was left in the hopper by America's radio geniuses, who were bent on making Dexy's Midnight Runners, Huey Lewis &amp; The News, and that gawdawful &quot;Oh Ricki You're So Fine&quot; record, hits.There's a reason talk radio became popular, y'know?Anyway, take the plunge. This is a masterful LP.

Another gem from Partridge et all and, once again, American radio ignores it in favor of Hootey and the Blowfish and other assorted garbage.SKYLARKING isn't the best XTC record--that would be ENGLISH SETTLEMENT--but it's a very good runner up. And SKYLARKING sports one of the band's very best songs, &quot;Summer's Cauldron,&quot; the very summation of those lazy summer days when every teen longs for...well...you know where I'm going here.The sonic leap the song takes into &quot;Grass&quot; is mind-boggling, but the connection is valid. &quot;The way you slap my face just fills me with desire...&quot; This is dirty English school stuff, which is what XTC is best at. &quot;It shocks me too, what we used to do on grass.&quot; It's a little play on words, I suppose, but the message is the same either way.Much of this album would have fit in nicely on any Dukes Of Stratosphear LP (You HAVE heard the psychedelic XTC-alter-ego Dukes of Stratosphear, haven't you?). &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Another Satellite,&quot; in particular, could fit in the grooves of a Dukes LP without anyone blinking an eye.The controversy piece here--and a nice nod back to the political stands taken on the first 2 or 3 XTC LPs--is &quot;Dear God.&quot; Unfortunately for those who attack Partridge for the supposed anti-God lyric, they miss the joke, as people with no sense of humor so often do. Read on, dear insulted:(A)Partridge writes a lyric about not believing in God.(B)He's address the lyric to God.(C)Therefore he believes in God.(D)Which obliviates the lyric itself.(E)Duh.It's a great album, a great ENGLISH album, which means you can expect melody, schoolboy wit, and choirboy voices. Ya can't beat that.

The bridge from the harsher punkish early-XTC and the more Beatle-ish later XTC, BLACK SEA was also the basic playlist for the final XTC tour.&quot;Respectable Street&quot; is one of the 2 or 3 best XTC singles. The first three songs on BLACK SEA, running into each other with barely a second to spare, are the strongest, most focused attack the band had yet put together; pointing fingers first at suburban conventions, military domination, and the habit of England and the US to push both friends and enemies to the edge of the abyss in order to get their way. Hot stuff.

XTC's most concentrated effort at breaking the American radio shutout, ORANGES &amp; LEMONS managed to crack the wall only slightly, proving once again that American radio is deader than dead.&quot;Garden Of Earthly Delights&quot; is perfection, a swirling vision that is awfully hard to follow. Luckily Partridge had &quot;Mayor Of Simpleton,&quot; one of his catchiest lovey-dovey pieces, in reserve. Everything that follows is frolicking fun, worthy of just the kind of promotion and attention Geffen and radio programmers denied it.This should have been a #1 LP, a whopping album-of-the-year kind of LP.

Blondie was a single-making machine. And, like all singles machines, their albums were spotty. Greatest Hits/Best Of packages, which I generally disdain, are a good idea when you're looking at singles machines.But here, you still have to wade through some of the dumb disco experiments Blondie couldn't seem to avoid. I program my machine to ignore &quot;Heart Of Glass,&quot; &quot;Rapture,&quot; and the nauseating &quot;The Tide Is High&quot;, preferring to stick to the sterling Pop singles that made Blondie a personal favorite of mine for about 6 months.The two greatest Blondie singles--and, I would argue, two of the greatest singles of the late 1970s--are both here. &quot;Hanging On The Telephone&quot; delivers a jolt of energy and excitement (&quot;I'd like to talk but I could show you my affection&quot;) that cannot be denied. &quot;One Way Or Another,&quot; cutting guitars, wailing Debbie Harry and all, is a perfect chunk of Pop Rock, one of the last great Pop Rock records to hit the American charts.&quot;Sunday Girl&quot; is great Pop; Chrysalis would have done well to include the similarly excellent &quot;Denise&quot; on this CD.

By the time I saw the Clash live at the Cape Code Civic Center, just as COMBAT ROCK was being released, they were beginning to lose some of their energy. The only numbers that seemed to get them back in form were the ones from their classic 1st LP, THE CLASH.I remember being unsure of this album on first listen. I liked the thunder chords on &quot;Clash City Rockers,&quot; but had a little trouble figuring out Joe Strummer's voice.Then the needle slipped into &quot;Complete Control,&quot; and they had me. This is energy in it's purest form, with a lightning guitar solo and Stummer's finger pointing outro: &quot;This is Joe Public speaking...and that means YOU!&quot;It changed my outlook on a lot of things.Keep in mind what brought this album, and much of punk, out into the open in the first place: police riots throughout the UK in 1975-77. The bobbies and fires on the cover of this record, and Stummer's battlecry, &quot;London's Burnin',&quot; aren't just the stuff of poseurs (a la Green Day)(Yech), they are the real deal, the voice of experience.The defining moment of the LP, and perhaps of the Clash's career, is &quot;Garageland.&quot; Stummer was never all that interested in the money or the fame, he just wanted to play in the band, tell anybody who'd listen what he was seeing. There was a short-lived effort, at least in the US, to try and turn punk into the next British invasion, labeling the Pistols the new Stones, the Clash the new Beatles, etc.. Strummer would have none of it, turning down the payoff the Clash might have received &quot;if the group would wear suits...We're A Garage Band.&quot;

Another example of the built-in danger of soundtracks, THE WILD THORNBERRYS boasts the best Paul Simon song since GRACELAND, an angelic closing tune, and a lot of worthless atmospheric boredom in between."Father and Daughter" is a great tune, a great guitar part and one of the best Paul Simon vocals in years, but the song is completely swamped by all of the dull, unimaginitive aural wallpaper that follows; most of it seemed outdated and boring the first time I listened to this CD.Does the world really need yet another recording of P. Diddy (or whatever he's calling himself this week) saying "C'mon, OK, Let's Go, C'mon, OK, OK, C'mon, OK, C'mon, OK" for almost 5 minutes? Enough is enough already, relegate this no-talent to K-Tel "Remembering Rap" albums and let's move on.Even the once-great Peter Gabriel falls for the soundtrack-trap, donating two pedestrian tunes, including one with Shaggy (another classic no-talent). The Pretenders walk their way through "Get Out Of London", rendering it totally null and void.The only vaguely bright spots on this CD are Sita's "Happy", Reel Big Fish's cover of Toots & The Maytel's "Monkey Man" (though it was already covered to perfection on THE SPECIALS classic first LP), and a little piece of perfection which closes the record, "Awa Awa," by Wes. It's a shame the first and last tunes on this CD are wrapped around a whole lot of nothing.There is a lot of blah'n'boring stuff here, including the now obligatory soundtrack-snores from Baha Men and Sting, that should have been kept on a shelf somewhere.

This great, great album, arguably the best of Waits career, has been in my Top 10 since the day I first heard it. If anything, it has edged higher up my personal chart as the years have gone by.Once upon a time it was a great late night drinking album, one my friends and I would listen to on cassette while driving from DC to Baltimore and back on a Saturday night. Later, during a phase I'll only mysteriously hint at, because that will give me a cool, artistic aura that drives chicks crazy, it was a late night drinking LP for me and me alone. Still later, it was a great CD to sing along to as I tried to get my newborn son to sleep. He still likes these songs.There is so much great music here that I won't even waste your time with a track-by-track review. My personal favorites are &quot;Old Shoes(&amp; Picture Postcards&quot; and &quot;Grapefruit Moon,&quot; but this is a near-perfect record, from open to close. Anyone who saw Bette Midler's teary version of &quot;Martha&quot; on Saturday Night Live a few generations ago could see the effect Waits songwriting had on his L.A. contemporaries.By the way, Waits version of &quot;Ol' 55&quot; proves that the Eagles, who covered it on their first LP, could kill even the greatest of tunes.

What's most fascinating about A PERFECT CANDIDATE is the inability of North and his staff to see what's going on around them: openly despised by a large percentage of their own party, publicly rebuked by fellow Republican and wildly popular US Senator John Warner and campaigning in the shadow of some of the largest negative polling figures in US political history, the North For Senate people still arrogantly assumed the office was theirs for the taking.Seeing their stunned faces on election night is worth the price of this tape.

I prefer the playful and stripped-down sound of MOTORCADE OF GENEROSITY to the We-Are-A-Serious-Rock-Band sound of FASHION NUGGET.On "M of G" John McCrea and Cake sound funny and fun; McCrea observes a lot but doesn't make too many judgement calls; the band chugs on "Haze of Love," "Jolene" and my favorite, "Rock 'N' Roll Lifestyle" (OK, there's quite a bit of judgement laid out on that one).There's a few clunkers--"I Bombed Korea," "Pentagram" and "Mr. Mastadon Farm" are sophomoric poetry, at best--but they are the exception, not the rule. McCrea can cook on the uptempo stuff, but that vocal delivery on a slow song is comic.The disc ends with a great one: "Ain't No Good," complete with Tex-Mex horns and a sloppy guitar solo, is some kind of bizarre hybrid, mixing the Velvet Underground and Los Lobos.

The songs on THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD are what fans call &quot;progessive&quot; or &quot;artful;&quot; critics label them &quot;self-absorbed,&quot; &quot;pompous&quot; and &quot;pretentious.&quot;Bowie has always walked that line. I have to admit I find it pretentious when he turns his accent off and on, or when, in his stage shows, he used to do mime. But more often than not he hits the nail on the head and his lyrics touch a nerve.I can't agree with the praise of &quot;All The Madmen,&quot; but &quot;The Width Of A Circle&quot; works for me, and &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot; is fantastic. It's the only tune on this record with any recognizeable structure, it has that soaring Mick Ronson lead part, and the vocals are mixed forward for a change. It took 25 years, Kurt Cobain and Nirvana to improve this song.If Tony Visconti had been any kind of producer at all this would have been a much better LP. Bowie's vocals are mixed low, drenched in echo and reverb, and often sound as if they were recorded over a telephone line. Visconti should have been shown the door.Luckily, Ronson saves the day. The man was a wizard, and there hasn't been anyone who played with such enthusiasm and power since he died.

This is pure 1950s Jazz, the kind that makes you feel like a filterless cigarette might be a good idea.The playing is flawless, the recording sterling, the swing endless.If I have one complaint here, it is Mingus's bass being hidden in a forest of other superb players. The first few bars of the record, just Mingus on bass, then piano, then horns and the rest, had me eager for a bass-heavy experience. It's all great stuff, but I wanted to hear the standup.This is a classic that any Jazz fan should own.

I went to see the movie with 7 or 8 friends during it's extremely short first release. It was, without a doubt, the worst big-budget film ever made.At one point Peter Frampton stands on the roof of a building, contemplating suicide. Several people in the audience--myself included--began shouting "Jump! Jump!"The problem with the film and the soundtrack was not the Bee Gees--though I find it hard to forgive them for SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and that gawdawful Streisand record, their pre-SNF career was great--or any of the second- and third-tier acts that fill out this record in an effort to jumpstart their doomed careers. The problem was Robert Stigwood, the man who cramped Eric Clapton's career for almost a decade and did his very best to turn the Bee Gees into some three-headed, foppish, voice-over team for his vision of 70's-chic.The reason critics and everyone else who saw this movie the first time around said it was awful had nothing to do with jealousy or protecting the Beatles or any of the other tripe some reviewers are tossing around; it was because the movie STINKS.It has become fashionable in the last decade to defend horrible movies by labeling them "camp." There is nothing "camp" about this movie or its soundtrack, it is just a very bad, very boring film. The careers of Frampton, the Bee Gees and several others were severely crippled by "Sgt. Pepper."I rated it 1 star because that's as low as the rating system goes; in reality it deserves -46 stars.

Along with STEAMIN' and KIND OF BLUE, 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT makes the argument that Miles Davis was the most influential Jazz men of the 20th century.Highlights include the title track, a raucus &quot;Ah-Leu-Cha,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird.&quot; Truly Miles at his emotional best.

Chuck Berry was the master, the true King of Rock &amp; Roll, and this album, which has few of the big Top 40 hits found on most Berry compilations, demonstrates his regency better than most.In the late 50s and early 60s, and then again in the late 60s and early 70s, Berry recorded dozens of songs that were filled with the smoke and BBQ ribs of the East St. Louis he came from; they were spicy and smart and grooved. Some of the best, if least well known, of those records are collected on BLUES. &quot;House of Blue Lights,&quot; &quot;Wee Wee Hours&quot; and others display Berry's master of traditional Blues, the form he converted into the chugga-chugga Rock &amp; Roll that altered American Pop for decades to come.There are uptempo tunes here, too, and some of them will be familiar to most Rock fans: &quot;I Just Want To Make Love To You&quot; was a standard cover for most Rock groups in the 60s and 70s, and &quot;Down The Road Apiece&quot; was covered--photo copied, some would say--by the early Rolling Stones, as was &quot;Route 66,&quot; though Berry slips in a nifty bit of guitar dissodence that makes his version unforgettable.The CD ends on a piece of pure gold, one of Berry's greatest records which, as far as I know, never hit the charts. &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; chugs like a steam train; the band smokes and Berry's guitar sings in that sloppy, happy way that his fans have always loved, but it has a nasty edge to it here, too.He was thE King of Rock &amp; Roll.

I'll catch holy heck for this--and it bothers me, because I really love Doris Day's movies, especially the Rock Hudson ones--but this CD proves only that her records were terrible.She has a nice Pop voice--warm and right in your face--but whoever selected her tunes should have been dragged through town by wild horses. 'Sugary sweet mush' is too kind, this is just syrupy junk.And her producers made a huge mistake when they tried to give her legitamacy by releasing &quot;Bewitched&quot; in a version strikingly similar to the Ella Fitzgerald &quot;Bewitched, Bothered &amp; Bewildered&quot; record. All it does is point out the greatness of Fitzgerald's version.&quot;Que Sera, Sera&quot; is more Day's speed, and it's a great Pop record. Unfortunately, you can't build a decent Greatest Hits package around a single tune.

I've always liked the idea behind NASHVILLE SKYLINE, but thought it felt incomplete.Some of Dylan's most beautiful songs--&quot;Girl From The North Country,&quot; &quot;Tell Me It Isn't True,&quot; &quot;Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You&quot;--are crippled by that voice (though it works to perfection on &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot;). Guest vocalist Johnny Cash sounds bored and confused.Worst of all, the total playing time of this CD is just over 27 minutes.

GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK presents the jazzy, poetic, early-version Springsteen, searching for his own sound.The problem with the first few Springsteen records, not resolved until 1975's BORN TO RUN, was an inability to recreate the band's legendary live shows on vinyl. &quot;Growin' Up&quot; is good here, it was downright riotous live, as various bootlegs and the version on the E-Street Band Live box set atest.But, despite some questionable production decisions and the inclusion of some occasionally pretentious clunkers, the early records are awash in great tunes. &quot;Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?&quot; is an amazing thing; &quot;For You&quot; a lament to a wacked lover; &quot;Growin' Up&quot; and &quot;It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City&quot; chest-puffing declarations of independence, and--well, who hasn't driven too far in the middle of the night, singing along to &quot;Spirit In The Night,&quot; the sister-piece to &quot;Rosalita&quot;?

Although there is just too much dissonate junk (&quot;Drugs,&quot; &quot;Electric Guitar,&quot; etc.) here for me to rate it as great record, FEAR OF MUSIC has some great moments.The first 7 tracks are all very good--I especially like Byrne's no-nonsense guitar at the end of &quot;Mind&quot;--and &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; is the ultimate gallows-goodtime record.The shocker here is the fine-print on the back of the CD, which reveals that the entire album was recorded in two days in the spring of 1978.Two days?!? In 1978 it took Pink Floyd that long to find the On/Off switch on their synthesizers.

This, for me, is the best of the nine-volume Columbia &quot;Essential&quot; set of Billie Holiday albums, because she has so much enrgy and exuberence. On later sets the effects of her, shall we say 'exhausting', lifestyle seem to take some of the wind out of her sails.Holiday can sound dirty without being dirty, if you get my drift. &quot;I Wished On The Moon&quot; gets across a pretty clear message, a very precise feel, without actually stating the message. Listen to the tune, you'll know exactly what I mean.I love Billie Holiday, all of her stuff, but this record is a different Billie. She's younger and more vibrant, more romantic, more hopeful. She's always brilliant, but here she's in a kissing mood, rather than a crying mood.

Man, when Al Green sings, how do you not feel it?Even when the arrangements aren't the greatest, Al Green makes it work. The patience in his singing, on things like &quot;I Can't Get Next To You&quot; and &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; makes these slower-than-the-hit versions groove.And when the tunes are closer to the level of this great, great singer--on &quot;Tired of Being Alone,&quot; &quot;L-O-V-E (Love)&quot; and &quot;Sha-La-La (Make Me Happy),&quot; Green made downright gorgeous records.There are a couple question marks here. Why the long sloppy intro, and less-than-hi-fi recording, on &quot;Have A Good Time&quot;? And why did nobody clean up &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;? These are two good songs, from what sound like two good sessions, presented in second rate fashion.The good stuff here far out weighs the bad.

It's amazing that XTC could make such a great live album, when you recall that they had to stop touring due to Andy Partridge's overwhelming stage fright--and that led, directly, to their Beatles-like transformation from a charming and energetic live act to an ingenious and imaginitive studio group.Don't waste time. Get this LP. American radio ignored XTC, their American label botched their promotion, and the result was that the band, despite it's best efforts, has withered on the vine. This record is one of several highlights from a career that you shouldn't have missed.

If you, like me, have spent years perplexed by Johnny Cash's reputation, when compared to his best-known latter day stuff (&quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;), this album THE SUN YEARS will straighten you out quick.His 1950's output--&quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; &quot;Get Rhythm,&quot; &quot;Hey Porter&quot; and others--were so different from anything else going on at the time. Luther Perkins guitar work was imaculate.And &quot;I Walk The Line&quot; a downright apocolyptic look at love and guilt and shame and obsession, is one of the all-time great American records.

The deadpan delivery and "Mexican Radio"-like instumentation sometimes wear thin, but every once in a while Cake drops a bomb on you that is worth the wait.The H-bomb on COMFORT EAGLE is the title track, which fairly throbs with some kind of evil foreshadowing--"It is useless to resist us"--and the kind of keyboard parts usually reserved for Public Enemy records. It's particularly disturbing since Cake points their finger only at a guy with the annoying habit of calling people "dude." It's the kind of song that makes me think Cake may be listening to the Beastie Boys when nobody is looking.

If you had written this same story in a fiction format, nobody would have stomached it. Nine men start a race around the world and no two finish it in quite the same way? One never stops, another goes insane, some drop out early, others are forced to ditch on the verge of finishing, and the winner is unlikely and likeable?But it's a true story, and a well told one at that. Nichols tells enough to make the layman feel at home with the nautical ins and outs of his story, but doesn't dumb it down so much as to exclude experienced sailers.

I've come to the Robbie Williams bandwagon late, I know, but please count me among those who recognize him for what he is: one of the best.Why Williams isn't an ultra-mega-superstar here in the US is beyond me (if you've read my reviews of the Jam, XTC, Morrissey and others, you know I place much of the blame for their US stiffs at the feet of their short-sighted record companies and America's tin-eared radio executives, criticisms which I think are justified in Williams case as well). &quot;Lazy Days,&quot; &quot;Strong&quot; and &quot;Win Some Lose Some&quot; sure sound like hits to me.And then there's &quot;She's The One,&quot; an absolute killer of a record. A gorgeous melody, a knock-out performance, a great big whopping sound, a classic lyric. If the rest of this CD had been junk, &quot;She's The One&quot; is good enough that it would have warrented a decent reveiw on its own merit.On &quot;Parkinson&quot; (on BBC America recently, but I guess it was actually an 18-month old interview), Williams said he couldn't figure out why Americans wouldn't buy his records, and said he has toyed with the idea of retiring from recording. Elton John, on the same program, said Williams is one of the most entertaining singers he's ever seen.Elton is right (Elton is always right). Wake up, America, before it's too late. Robbie Williams is fantastic, and &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; is a great Pop record.

The jazzy Bruce of GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK sounds like he listened to a lot of Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire while making THE WILD THE INNOCENT AND THE E STREET SHUFFLE.Much of the earlier jazz coloring is gone, replaced by an odd attempt at a funkier sound. Jazz and Funk are only the tints on these early Springsteen records, though--beneath it all you can hear, in retrospect anyway, a rocker struggling to break free.You can also hear, under all the layers of studio clutter Mike Appel insisted on dumping onto this record, a great songwriter coming to the fore. &quot;4th Of July Asbury Park,&quot; &quot;Incident On 57th Street,&quot; and &quot;New York City Serenade&quot; are mulit-layered epics, maybe too obviously derivative (Dylan &amp; Tom Waits), but still little masterpieces on their own.And, as with GREETINGS' &quot;Spirit In The Night,&quot; was it ever really a party without at least one late-night rendition of &quot;Rosalita&quot;? Springsteen has said the band through everything into that tune, everything but the kitchen sink. I'm glad they did, it's great, great fun.

When ELO was bad, they were corny and saccharine. But, when they were good, they were just fantastic.To dismiss something as gorgeous as "Can't Get It Out Of My Head" as 'fluff' or 'lightweight' is beyond my comprehension. Like the bulk of ELO's stuff it is a soundtrack in search of a film: technicolor cinemascope on a huge curved wrap-around screen, with six dozen audio speakers and a plush scarlet curtain 60 feet high and 180 feet wide...Well, ELO does that to you: leaves you to glory in the wonder and beauty of art, even if it is pop (small 'p') art. "Rockaria!" may seem trivial to some, but it is such a sincere celebration of music itself--a Pop (large 'p') praise for Classical in a light Rock format--that it is a cold man who won't let himself enjoy it."Strange Magic" is just that, an oddly effecting piece carried by Lynne's breathy vocal. When he says he's never going to be the same again, you know just what he means. Avoiding this tune on the radio in the summer of 1975 was an impossibility.And there is the overlooked masterpiece, "Mr. Blue Sky," an entire full-color cinematographer's blueprint in 5 minutes, the soundtrack to some forgotten Disney short.Perhaps ELO's critics were right all along, maybe these are little LSD episodes for the post-60's generation. Maybe this is Pop of a lighter brand than Lynne's 60's-icon heroes would have have messed with, made more pallitable by masterful production.But it's still great Pop.

With all due respect, singing out of tune does NOT an &quot;avant garde&quot; record make.If you want to hear the Clash, listen to everything between the first LP (GreenSleeve) and Sandinista. You'll hear all of the power and experimentation that some reviewers are so enamored of, without having to sit through &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go.&quot;The highlights of this LP--which is a bad Clash LP, making it only 20 times better than anything contemporaries Haircut 100 or Duran Duran ever did--are &quot;Straight To Hell,&quot; &quot;Know Your Rights,&quot; and even &quot;Overpowered By Funk,&quot; which is something of a watered-down version of &quot;Radio Clash,&quot; originally available only on 12-inch, but now found on one of the compilations.The problem seems to have been a parting of the ways between Strummer and Mick Jones, who were (at the time) compared, personality-wise, to Lennon and McCartney. Neither matched up in solo-stuff to LeMac--Jones had a couple minor dance hits, based mostly on sampling that he had nothing to do with, and Strummer did one good soundtrack and several enemic solo shots, including a truly embarrassing &quot;Clash&quot; record--he was the lone original member--called &quot;Cut The Crap.&quot;This LP is owrth having for the highlights, but don't expect to enjoy it end-to-end to often.

One of the truly great pieces of Art in American recording history, NEBRASKA explores the dark stories of the characters who chose to take to the road in THE RIVER.They hit middle America and go crazy. Simple as that.These are stories of killers and cops, truck drivers and, frankly, people who have been driven to such a degree that they can no longer find their way through the comprimises and grey areas that they find themselves swimming in.I've always been fascinated by Springsteen's phrasing on NEBRASKA. &quot;Me and her went for a ride, sir.&quot; There's always that &quot;sir,&quot; or &quot;mister,&quot; and the wording is sparse. To me, these songs sound like death row confessions.To me, &quot;Atlantic City&quot; ranks as one of Springsteen's finest moment, a tough-as-nails story of a man comprimising his own morals/ethics in order to get himself and his wife out of a dying town--and considering the unimaginable in order to finance their escape. But he still needs to console himself, rationalize his decision, before he can live with it:&quot;I've been looking for a job but it's hard to find. Down here it's just winners and losers, and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line. Well, I'm tired of coming out on this losing end. So honey last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him...but I guess everything dies baby, that's a fact, but maybe everything that dies one day comes back...&quot;NEBRASKA is not a fun-time party album. It's dangerous to listen to it in your car at 3 a.m.. But it is a piece of perfection, a story of the cultural decay Springsteen and his characters found in the USA in 1982, stories of desperate people in bad situations. It is a record that will be just as vital and important in 100 years as it was upon it's release.NEBRASKA is true Art of the highest order.

This is fine country blues by an often overlooked master. These are songs of tough times by someone who really knew what he was talking about--jail stories from a man who had spent time on those old rural jails that everyone really had reason to fear. My personal favorite is Parchman Farm Blues, a tune that conveys sadness, maybe even hopelessness, more clearly than most anything I've ever heard.

BLACK MARKET CLASH pulls together most of the Clash's best stuff that couldn't be found on LPs during their too few years of greatness.For me the best of mid-career Clash were the Dub records, represented here by "Bank Robber," "Armagideon Time" and "Justice Tonight." They may not have had the authentic Jamaican roots, but Joe Strummer had the cajones to put a white Englishman's mark on Dub like nobody else.Along with the classic albums LONDON CALLING and SANDINISTA!, BLACK MARKET CLASH presents the Clash at their very best.

The most complete collection of the most important work by the most dominant American musician of the first half of the 20th century.Too much hype?Trust me, this is a great collection, worthy of that hype. These are the recordings that cemented Armstrong's reputation as the most important instrumentalist of the age.

I wish I'd paid attention to the first review, because I had the exact same experience...the lens sent to me is not the one pictured in this ad and, in fact, is a piece of junk. You'd think that if they'd been told once that their ad had the wrong pic, they'd fix the problem...but no.I hope you read both reviews and take our advice: don't buy from this seller.+++++++ Since I wrote my review the seller has contacted me to see he will refund my money...but only if I'll change my initial review. Sorry, I don't think he should be allowed to continue misrepresenting his product.He hasn't been able to explain why he advertises one product but sends another.

A fine starting point for Jazz novices, STANDARD TIME is also a great introduction to Marsalis' music.The complaint about composition is certainly valid. While some will argue that Jazz is intent on tradition, I would counter that Jazz lost it's place as America's most popular music when composition was given a back seat to soloists.

There's some really good stuff here, including Saldip Jabble's gorgeous &quot;Janj Mahi Ley Aya.&quot; I could have done without some of the more western influenced, more baltently disco tunes, particlularly Bombay Talkie's &quot;Chargiye,&quot; but this is still a fine overview of Bhangra.

You can't have too many Aretha Franklin LPs. The organic sound of her early records, combined with the greatest voice in Soul and Pop music, made for a string of records almost uniformly great.30 GREATEST HITS sweeps through those years, and pulls up short before the embarrassing &quot;Highway Of Love&quot; years. Songs like &quot;Call Me,&quot; &quot;You're All I Need,&quot; and &quot;Oh Me Oh My&quot; are perfect gems that you may not have heard before, and &quot;Until You Come Back To Me&quot; is one of the all time great forgotten singles.

A surprisingly good soundtrack which both my kids and I like to listen to in the car.I still question the use of second-generation remakes and performances not actually in the film on soundtracks (in this case, Joan Jett is shut out of her own &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;), but in this case there is an upside. The version of &quot;Hallejuah&quot; on the CD is leaps and bounds better than the one in the film.

I love Ray Davies.I know Dave Davies has always been the critic's darling--all that talk about Dave being the godfather of punk guitar isn't so far off the mark--but Ray Davies has the best heart in Rock & Roll.But all that matters not a nit to much of the American public, who always left the Kinks sitting in second place behind the troika of Stones, Beatles and Who--maybe even behind Led Zeppelin and the over-ranked Animals--when it comes to discussions of British Rock. That's a shame, because the Kinks songwriting is as good or better than all of the above sans Beatles; Ray Davies lyrics are, at times, Dickensian.COME DANCING WITH THE KINKS mines the Kinks most successful commercial period (In the USA, at least) from '77 to '86. The band seemed to be more intent on conquering the USA than they had been in the mid/late 1960s, and their problems with American unions, which had given the Kinks a lot of trouble a decade earlier, seemed to ease. They became known as a touring band in the States, a reputation which crumbled after a very well publicized onstage battle between the Davies brothers right here in Washington DC.Though there is one minor bow to the then-omnipresent Disco--"Wish I Could Fly Like Superman," COME DANCING WITH THE KINKS is mostly full of nostalgia for the old ballrooms, desperate pleas for the band to stay together, and Rays infatuation with psychological oddities. Included are some of my favorite Kinks tunes, including "Do It Again," "Destroyer," "Come Dancing," "Don't Forget to Dance," and my All Time Favorite Kinks Record, "Sleepwalker." There's never been a better melding of Rays lyrics, Daves guitar, a great Ray vocal, and hot Kinks backing vocals. "Father Christmas" is perfect, the exact Christmas tune you'd expect from Ray Davies, and is played to perfection. The live renditions of "Lola" and "You Really Got Me" don't match up to the studio versions, I think, but they were hits, so somebody liked them."Misfits" and "Rock & Roll Fantasy" are classic Davies. The first looks at a fading eccentric--it's easy enough to imagine the tune as autobiographical--and gives a McCartneyesque pat on the head, with a real Ray Davies twist: "You've been a misfit all your life; why don't you join the crowd and come on inside?" he says, even while pointing out that the world is filled with misfits: "They've given up living cause they just don't care. So take a good look around, the misfits are everywhere."I completely missed the point of "Rock n Roll Fantasy" when it was released; now I consider it one of the Kinks very best. Ray sings of his brother wanting to quit the band, sings about desperate music fans who spend every night locked in their flats spinning records. On first listen I thought this was glorification of the fans, mythologizing loners worshipping wax. Now I hear the pleading in Ray's voice at the end of the song and understand that he wanted to keep the band going so he wouldn't become one of those solitary people: "You and me keep thinking our life has passed us by? I Don't want to live my life in a Rock n Roll fantasy," he sings--Ray Davies wants the Real Deal."Don't want to waste my life hiding away anymore--don't want to waste my life living in a Rock n Roll fantasy."I love Ray Davies: Hero of the awkward, the lonely, the depressed, the introverted.There is another Kinks Greatest Hits/Best Of package you should hunt down, which will fill the gaps between the British Invasion "You Really Got Me" phase of the Kinks and this album: KINKS KRONIKLES, a two-CD set, covers my favorite phase of this great band's career--the Arthur & Victoria phase.But if you really want to 'get' the Kinks, hunt down all of their LPs released prior to '77: they were a lot more English during that phase, and their stuff really deserves to be heard in the fleshed out form of an LP, rather than on a Greatest Hits/Best Of package.

What makes this fine LP for me is Katherine Whalen's voice. The way she hops into a falsetto at the bridge on &quot;Put A Lid On It&quot; gets me going every time, and the same voice has the same effect on me when I hear &quot;Prince Nez.&quot; She just kills on &quot;Blue Angel.&quot; She's priceless.And this band swings, in that swingin' pre-Swing way. &quot;Hell,&quot; which became a surpise MTV fave, is the most modern-sounding thing here, so don't be expecting an insight into youth culture.A lot of this sounds like 4 a.m. in the French quarter. The kind of music you'd want to listen to on a night on the town with Tom Waits.

There are some wonderful moments on this CD, but I think someone fell asleep when the running order was being typed up.For starters, why is the first tune of the original show the 12th song on the disc? Call me picky, but it seems a little odd halfway through a CD to hear Pete Townshend say &quot;I'd like to start with a song which...&quot;I love the Townshend stuff on this CD. While it's all available elsewhere--and many of the tunes have alternate versions available on &quot;Secret Policeman's...&quot; and various other records--there is a straightforward simplicity here that I think is great. Unadorned and unpretentious, as you would expect from private shows at Oceanic.But I don't have much interest in the Raphael Rudd stuff. It never crossed my mind that any Rock record would sound better if only it had a harp added to the mix, and this is proof that I was right.This is a record for Pete Townshend completists, I suppose. So call me completist.

What's most amazing about this album--released at the epicenter of the 1960s Pop world--is the raw, naked blues guitar attack.Clapton was at the height of his true blues period, just on the cusp of the psychedelic tricks he would unload on an unsuspecting England with Cream, and Mayall was smart enough to mix the guitar WAY forward. The result is an album of smart licks that are imitated by lesser talents to this very day.The best track is the first, &quot;All Your Love.&quot; Clapton starts off in a pure Blues mode, but slips in some awfully Jazz-like moves. It's fantastic stuff, and no one playing today comes anywhere near the kind of confidence and finesse Clapton displays here.The rest of the band is top flight as well. John McVie was an under-rated bass player his whole career, and Mayall was an adequate harpist and organist...his vocals are always open for debate, though. Seems to me Jack Bruce's vocals on Cream records were very similar to Mayall without the occasional uncomfortable screeching Mayall was known for.

Probably the most Miles-like Marsalis LP, though the mood isn't as dark or the playing as intense as Davis, HOT HOUSE FLOWERS is alive with traditional tunes and traditional playing.A fine version of &quot;Stardust&quot; and a surprisingly hot &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot; are the standout tunes here, but this is a fine record from start to finish.

Bennett has a stunning voice, but many of his early records were crippled by pedestrian orchestration and half-hearted production.Then there's &quot;I Left My Heart In San Francisco,&quot; one of the most captivating recordings of the 1950s. I still have a problem with the MOR horns up front in the mix, but the cool vibes and some tasty piano help drive this tune along to Bennett's gorgeous vocal crescendo. &quot;I Wanna Be Around&quot; follows much the same pattern, though the band is a little jazzier.But the crowning achievement of Bennett's long singing career has to be &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile.&quot; After a dramatic build up, Bennett avoids the cliched, big-throated reading a lesser talent would have fallen into, delivering instead a dramatic, breathy rendition that Sinatra would have been proud of.

An absolute marvel, and--here comes a trite but true phrase--a life-changing LP that makes as much sense to me today as it did when I bought my first vinyl copy when I was 17. QUADROPHENIA is the greatest album from the only group that mattered to me one little nit in those days, and it is just as meaningful today.For those who have been introduced to the Who through TOMMY and think that's some kind of sustained thought and performance, be prepared to have that perception destroyed. The Who of TOMMY sounds meak and mild compared to the QUADROPHENIA version; Townshend's libretto on TOMMY sounds positively juvenile in comparison.The band's playing had taken a light-years leap by QUADROPHENIA. Moon's drums are let loose by Townshend's compositions, and Pete's guitar playing runs the gammut you can also hear on LIVE AT LEEDS: he draws you into the soft, flowing sections, only to pound you with the ol' sturm and drang, he floats through pastoral scenes and then drops the A-bomb on them.And, of course, QUADROPHENIA ends with the greatest of all Who recordings, the original studio version of &quot;Love Reign O'er Me,&quot; which concludes with Keith Moon absolutely demolishing any argument belittling his ability. He was the greatest of all rock drummers. The man was IT.QUADROPHENIA appeals so readily to 17-year old males and, as another reviewer so astutely put it, the 17-year old in all of us, because Townshend so accurately recalled the torment that goes on in your head at 17. Jimmy is stuck on the cusp between adolescence and adulthood, wanting to end his childhood without turning into his father. In the end, something is dead at the bottom of the White Cliffs of Dover--but what? Jimmy? Or his childhood, as represented by his bike?Townshend, one of the very few rockers who seemed to have a real emotional attachment to his audience (an attachment that was torn and tattered over the years, but is still there, judging by his recent recordings for children's charities), was also one of the very few who made a legitimate attempt to write about the challenges and changes that his audience faced. More often than not, he struck it right on the mark.QUADROPHENIA is a masterpiece.

Springsteen is, in my never-quite-humble opinion, one of the few true artists of Rock, and possibly the only American one of the past 25 or so years.That said, Tunnel of Love is hardly a peak performance. The production is cold, the performances--excluding Bruce's vocals--are restrained to the point of dullness, and a few of the songs--particularly &quot;Spare Parts&quot; and &quot;When You're Alone&quot;--leave a lot to be desired.There are moments of greatness here, though. I think Bruce's singing on &quot;Cautious Man,&quot; especially the first eight or ten lines, is absolute perfection. Listen to &quot;it was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away.&quot; This is the essence of art; Springsteen doesn't just tell you, he SHOWS you, you can feel that wave of calm coming over the character. That moment, along with &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; &quot;All That Heaven Will Allow,&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; all help this LP overcome some of its shortcomings.I'm not the first reviewer to suggest that Springsteen is as close to a novelist as Rock has ever seen. This album is a short story, helping to transition the man and his characters from a sustained adolescence to adulthood. It's never an easy move--some traits and some characters don't carry over, some things that you swore you'd never become, swore you'd never leave behind, come to pass if you're going to survive. Springsteen, always a fine mix of optimist, realist and romantic, made even leaving the glory days behind and moving on to responsibility and adult life cool. To note that love is NOT always enough (&quot;It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love&quot;) and to sing of faraway romance (&quot;Valentine's Day&quot;---&quot;tonight I miss my girl, mister, tonight I miss my home&quot;) on the same LP is, I think, to acknowledge that life and love are hard and sometimes unfair, but they're still worth it.And--as he began with &quot;Darkness On The Edge of Town&quot;--Springsteen confronts the bad within himself. &quot;Two Faces,&quot; despite two horrible keyboard solos, is another fine example of his self-confrontation. That is, I think, the trait that most makes me admire Springsteen: he is an optimist who wants to to good, but isn't so arrogant as to think for a moment that he is a saint. Good, in Springsteen's ovre, isn't purity, but the will to fight against the evil in yourself.The fact that he then turns that introspection into a dissection of himself, his partner, and their relationship as a whole in &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; (&quot;Now look at me baby, struggling to do everything right, and then it all falls apart...I want to know if it's you I don't trust, cause I damn sure don't trust myself...God have mercy on the man who doubts what he's sure of&quot;) proves his genious, and shows that even a minor Springsteen LP, like this one, is Art.This was an important moment for Springsteen, where he stepped back from the trappings he found in Superstardom and began to straighten out his life and his career. Lennon took five years to get his head together; Springsteen did it a little faster. Elvis never did it.As Springsteen and Lennon both pointed out, every rocker wanted to be Elvis, but none of them wanted to end up like him.Elvis wasted himself to death, mired in eternal adolescence; Lennon was gunned down too shortly after making the transition. Springsteen made it through the worst of it and came out a better man and a true artist, fulfilling the promise of &quot;Born To Run&quot; and &quot;The River.&quot;

Despite instruments that sound like they were stolen from the soundtrack to The Munsters, &quot;Come On-A My House,&quot; &quot;Botch-A-Me&quot; and &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot; are some of the sexiest records you'll ever hear.Rosemary Clooney was a shockingly erotic singer in her early days---I mean, this woman sings like a WOMAN. When she calls out &quot;Hey Gumba,&quot; it sounds pretty darn good to me.The pseudo-Italian she sings in the breaks of &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot; could get you arrested in a lot of southern towns, and it isn't the words she's singing, it's the way she sings them.Oi!

Such a fine movie.Such a lousy soundtrack.It worked when you watched Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal walk through Central Park in Autumn but it's a different story in your living room. If you don't fall asleep while Harry the Hype Connick Jr. mumbles his way through a very lame Sinatra impression, you're drinking too much coffee.I'm pretty sure there's a moment or two during &quot;Love Is Here To Stay&quot; where Connick and his band actually dozed off. Good editing to splice that &quot;performance&quot; back together.For Sinatra-like performances it's always a better idea to get albums recorded by one Albert Francis Sinatra.

A great translation of the book the west loves to fear and the east loves to misquote. Kind of a perfect negative image of the King James bible, which the east loves to fear and the west habitually turns on its head for political expediency.It's enough to make even the most faithful pray for an agnostic calling.Read them both--and the Bhagavad Gita, and the Book Of Common Prayer, and all of the rest--and then decide for yourself. God is not a building or a dogma or a treatise or a lecture or a lesson or a command from any other man. God is a voice, and only you can hear it.

Remember when you were a kid and you'd see those commercials on TV for a record with a bunch of familiar songs on it that you liked, and the announcer kept saying "sung by the original artists," and then when you got the record it didn't sound any good--because the songs were all recorded by a bunch of studio hacks calling themselves "The Original Artists?"I think that's what we have here. "On My Radio" is done by The Selector, and the old Bob Marley tune "Mr. Chatterbox" sounds like it is truly the King of Reggae, but everything else on this triple-disc CD sounds like it's being faked by "The Original Artists."I am a huge fan of The Specials and I can tell you without fear of contradiction that they are not on this record, no matter what the credits claim. Yes, "Gangsters" and "A Message To You Rudi" are songs from the first Specials LP, but it's somebody else sleepwalking through the songs on this CD, and they aren't doing a very good job of it, either.In fact, it sounds like the same pedestrian vocalist on most of the songs on this CD, backed by some less than average studio musicians. During "Gangsters" the singer keeps yelling "Mobster! Gangster!"; on "James Bond," a tune which is credited to The Selector, the same vocalist spends three minutes yelling "James Bond! Tequila! James Bond! Dr. No! Tequila!" There are some fake crowd sounds to make a few songs sound like they were recorded live. It sounds to me like even the British accent is faked.The songs credited to Judge Dread are embarassingly bad, and the demolition of Madness's "One Step Beyond" by Inspector 7 is even worse. On some tunes the drummer can't keep a steady beat, inexplicably speeding up and slowing down mid tune.Worst of all, the mastering of this CD is awful. The vocals are mixed way too high (after being recorded completely flat); both tracks from Lee Perry seem to have been transferred to CD with the tape machine running wayyyyyyyyyyy too slow. Yech! The 3 or 4 songs that sound like they are actually versions by the bands they are credited to are particularly poorly recorded, as if somebody just sat down at a CD burner with a worn 45.I love Ska; this ain't it.

Volume 5 demonstrates quite clearly the split personality of American Top-40 radio in the mid 1970s; it seemed quirky at the time but the kind of open-mindedness that would allow Jerry Reed, Richie Havens and Jesus Christ Superstar to sit side-by-side on the charts is sorely missed today.As with all of the CDs in this series there are some clunkers that must be included for historical accuracy (&quot;Chick-A-Boom,&quot; &quot;Get It On&quot; and the Jerry Reed song), some gems (Richie Havens, Tommy James, and the JCSuperstar track), and a couple of songs that virtually nobody remembers (&quot;Games&quot; and &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;).For me the highlight of Vol. 5 is the Fortunes &quot;Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again.&quot; In addition to a fine vocal and a great rhythm track, it has one of those great early-to-mid-70s fade outs, complete with the soaring string parts also heard on the Bee Gees &quot;Lonely Days,&quot; Grand Funks' &quot;I'm Your Captain&quot; and the Beatles &quot;All You Need Is Love.&quot; It's a great effect that I never get tired of.

I'm not a great fan of this type of collection, but this one has one of my all-time favorite tunes on it that can be found nowhere else (&quot;Toast And Marmalade For Tea&quot;), and most of the other tunes take me back to the AM-radio playing at my suburban neighborhood pool what seems like 1000 years ago.There are, as there always are with these collections, 4 or 5 tunes that are just garbage and would be better off forgotten. Why would anyone listen to &quot;The Assembled Multitude&quot; (whatever that is) stumble through the Overture from Tommy when the Who's version is lightyears better? Why would anyone listen to The New Seekers &quot;I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing,&quot; a tune better known for being used in a Coke commercial than anything else? And why, why, WHY would anyone listen to Wayne Newton sing anything at all?The 70's were very weird, that's why.By the way, I grew up during this period and listened to the radio every waking hour, and I can say with absolute confidence that I never heard of Flash or their awful, awful song &quot;Small Beginnings&quot; until I bought this CD.

These are much more restrained chants than someone like Krishna Rah. I suppose that's reflective of the decade this record was made.This is a light, though sincere and effective, approach to enlightenment. For the average music fan, or the curious Beatle peeble, it will be nothing more than a curiosity, unfortunately. For the spiritually minded, it is a nice set piece, but not the whole cloth.

Quick: Name every Punk or New Wave album that dealt intelligently with a dissolving relationship between two adults.There was only one: UNDER THE BIG BLACK SUN.Beyond the tumbling-down-the-stairs effect ot the X rhythm section, some sizzling lead guitar, and those great appalachina harmonies from Cervanka and Doe, X stood out from the Los Angeles music scene because of their great lyrics. Somehow they managed to avoid all that stupid &quot;whip me I'm your dog&quot; stupidity that made other bands--I'm thinking specifically of the Germs, but there were plenty of others) pointless beyond their first single. X was a real band and Cervanka, at least, had a brain in her head.Oddly enough, this record doesn't reveal it's best song until the end of the CD. &quot;The Have Nots&quot; may be the best thing X ever recorded, a mid-tempo rocker that builds to a roaring list of gallows-humor one liners for the underclass (&quot;Dawn comes soon enough for the working class--it keeps getting sooner or later,&quot;) and L.A. red-eye bars.This was their finest moment. They'd trimmed some of the rougher elements from their sound, and the Cervenka/Doe breakup proved too much for the band to overcome. Everything from here on out was spotty, at best.

Melanie is one of those musicians who wasn't particularly popular even when she was popular, if you know what I mean.There were three magic moments for Melanie, and they are all here in fine remastered condition."Lay Down (Candles In The Rain)" is as captivating today as it was more than 30 years ago, vibrating between the soaring Edwin Hawkins Singers and the mumbling/shouting witch act Melanie never created again."What Have They Done To My Song, Ma?" was a quirky little thing, much like "Those Were The Days," which came out about the same time."Brand New Key," another novelty, but somehow sexy and catchy. I have a personal attachment to it, and the upper register parts are some of the best singing Melanie ever recorded.And then there's the rest of this CD. I suppose there are people who like this kind of wandering, meandering, clumsy songwriting--but I've never been one of them.

For about six weeks in 1980 WHFS in Washington DC, then a great progressive radio station, loved Pearl Harbor &amp; The Explosions. Hard as it is to believe now, songs like &quot;Drivin'&quot; and &quot;Shut Up And Dance&quot; sounded progressive way back when.But it's 23 years further on down the road and this record sounds...well, 23 years old. The guitars sound a lot less edgy, the bass sounds suspiciously disco at times, and the songwriting is a lot more mundane than it seemed when I was in highschool.&quot;Drivin'&quot; and &quot;Up and Over&quot; are still great fun, though.

HAPPY TRAUM is a wondrous thing, Poppy and melodic without being drippy or sugared-down.This is the only album I've ever heard that reminds me of the best of mid-career Beach Boys--including PET SOUNDS--without overtly copying it. Yes, the color combos on the cover are the same as PET SOUNDS and yes, there is a pic of the band standing neck-deep in the surf--and, yes, some of the lead vocals sound disarmingly similar to early-70s Carl Wilson--but there is so much more to this record than a Beach Boys-mimic band could ever hope to achieve."Surely Justice," for instance, sounds more like XTC than Brian Wilson. I can't get enough of this song; I've had sessions in the last few months where I listen to it 8 or 10 times straight, something I've only done a handful of times since I was 17. A truly great Pop record.There are some less-than-perfect moments--I could do without "Desmond Don't Go," for starters--but the overall effect of this album is mesmerizing. From the Pop fizz of "Surely Justice" to the the Brian Wilson/Paul McCartney-esque swirl of "The Miracle Legion," from the swing of "When You Cry" to the Monkees-like "Money or Love" to the achingly sweet "Riverside" and "The Leaves,"--which sounds like the Beach Boys teaming up with America and playing a Jim Morrison tune--HAPPY TRAUM is a truly great album.So how come nobody here in the States has heard of them?Does anyone really need to hear me rant and rave about the sorry state of American radio again?

The first lead instrument on TOMMY, one of the most influential Rock albums ever by the greatest Rock band ever, is....a French Horn.The first vocal on TOMMY, recorded by a band which boasted one of the most influential lead singers in Rock history, Roger Daltrey, is sung by...Pete Townshend. Townshend also sings the second tune. And the third.It's that kind of an album.The music on TOMMY is superb--you'll have a hard time getting me to bad-mouth Pete Townshend, ever--and the performances, particularly by Townshend and John Entwistle are top notch. But Daltrey seems muted, Keith Moon's drums are mixed way down, and the album seems oddly quiet.(The real deal, the hot recordings of TOMMY, were recorded live at Woodstock, Monterey Pop and, in pieces, on LIVE AT LEEDS. Look for these songs on video on WOODSTOCK, MONTEREY POP, and THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT.)I've always considered QUADROPHENIA the penultimate Who album, but there is a moment in TOMMY that keeps it nipping at QUADROPHENIA's heels: it's Townshend stepping up to the microphone to sing his love-song to his audience:&quot;Listening to you I get the music, gazing at you I get the heat, following you I climb the mountain, I get excitement at your feet. Right behind you I see the millions, on you I see the glory, from you I get opinions, from you I get the story.&quot;Townshend may claim this was a religious statement, but I prefer to go on believing he sang it to you and me. He always had the most interesting relationship with his audience and his generation of anyone in Rock, and this was the defining moment of that realtionship.

This is a soundtrack.Know what I mean?The Miles Davis stuff is great--but it would make more sense to buy the Miles Davis CDs and hear the tunes in the context in which they were presented by the artist.The Israel Kamakawiwo'ole song is atmospheric, nothing more, which is why it was picked for the EToys commercial last year.And the Bill Frisell stuff...well, let me put it this way: Are there any soundtracks that do NOT have Bill Frissell songs on them?Beware the soundtrack album: it rarely bares second listening.

Thank you, Eric Clapton, for organizing the wonderful Sept. 2002 Concert for George at the Royal Albert Hall, and for making sure it was filmed and recorded so beautifully. Director David Leland has delivered what may be the greatest concert film of all time.Anoushka Shankar doesn't possess the genious of her father, but her rendition of &quot;Your Eyes&quot; is wonderful, an inspired start to the program, and the fully orchestrated &quot;Arpan&quot; she conducts is gorgeous in a way only music from the subcontinent can be. The concluding acoustic guitar solo by Clapton is incredible. Harrison made sure western ears heard Shankar's music, though too many westerners, who love harmony above all else in music, don't appreciate the pure melody and complex time changes of Indian music. I fell in love with Indian classical through Harrison's music, and I owe him a debt of gratitude for it.The western band, led by Clapton &amp; Jeff Lynne, delivers picture perfect renditions of a batch of Harrison's best songs from the length and breadth of his career; many of their versions are better than any Harrison, who had a nasty habit of re-working his own material with maddingly spotty results, ever delivered on stage.I've never understood Ringo as a frontman and don't like that McCartney plays no bass on stage, but the program gets a second wind with the appearances of the former Beatles.For me the emotional highlights of the program are McCartney's ukelele version of &quot;Something,&quot; which turns into a note-for-note replication of the ABBEY ROAD version, with Clapton on lead guitar and Starr's drums sounding like cannons; and Joe Brown's closing &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams.&quot; Wonderful, wonderful stuff.It is the perfect wake that we should all hope for ourselves; a warm, funny, loving, beautiful--but never maudlin--tribute; a celebration of the life of the Quiet Beatle, who changed so many millions of our lives.Thank you, Eric Clapton.

For every idiot who has told me how &quot;awesome that guy in the Pepsi-One commercials is,&quot; I present this album as an education in American music.Ray Charles made some of the finest sides ever, and the band he used for most of these sides is a smoother, more blues-based version of James Brown's crack soul band. Charles sounds young--really young--on these songs. It's hard to believe it's the same guy who waddles around in a purple glitter jacket, lip-synching bad soft-drink jingles during half-time of XFL games.Listen to the way he chugs through &quot;I've Got A Woman&quot;--Elvis covered it and sounded downright lame in comparison. Harder blues like &quot;Blackjack&quot; and &quot;Come Back&quot; show off a masterful voice. The Beatles used to do &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot; in their Hamburg days, and all of the British invasion bands did &quot;What'd I Say,&quot; one of the hottest, hottest, HOTTEST records to ever hit the American charts, in their stage acts at one point or another.My personal favorites here are &quot;(Night Time Is)The Right Time,&quot; &quot;That's Enough,&quot; and the aching &quot;Just For A Thrill.&quot;

For someone like me, a music lover who has always found Broadway musicals overblown and silly, WEST SIDE STORY is an incredible eye-opener. Bernstein found a common ground between Jazz and Classical and, once in your system, the music never leaves you.Some of the spoken word on this CD sound is beyond corny now--you get the feeling it was outdated upon release--but Sondheim more than makes up the difference with his lyrics. If you aren't moved by &quot;There's A Place For Us,&quot; you don't have a heart.

I should preface this by admitting that I am addicted to the Sopranos. Like the &quot;I saw the future of rock'n'roll,&quot; comment about Springsteen, the &quot;best television show, ever&quot; review seemed out of control...until you saw Springsteen/Sopranos, and realized the reviewer was right on the mark.That said, the soundtrack is good, but not great. To have a copy of &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; on the CD while driving is sublime; a couple of other things are worth it. Springsteen's inclusion is great, but you should already be carrying a copy of NEBRASKA with you everywhere you go, so who needs another copy? The best thing here is the Nick Lowe song, &quot;The Beast In Me,&quot; which I listen to over and over and over--I mean, I played that song 8 times in a row last night, I just can't get enough of it.But some of the other songs here...the Elvis song--and this comes from an Elvis fan--is pointless. It's that middle-of-his-career Elvis, where there's an impressive style, but no emotion. The Wyclef Jean song is junk. The Los Lobos is just average Los Lobos. The Eurythmics song is the same old Eurythmics song--and it's been played to death on SoftRock radio stations.Again, I'm a Sopranos addict. I bought this, I'll probably get the next one. If you aren't a huge fan of the show, with something visual to relate the Sinatra song to, for example, it might not work for you. I love Sinatra, but &quot;It Was A Very Good Year&quot; doesn't exactly dovetail with R.L. Burnside or Bob Dylan.I tried to quit watching the Sopranos, y'know. Tried to go back to The Practice and E.R.. Then Tony's mom dropped a dime on him and, I dunno...I keep trying to get out, and they keep pulling me back in.Hey, waddya gonna do, eh?

&quot;Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)&quot; is one of my all-time favorite pop singles, an absolute masterpiece of that early-70s genre that allowed the Archies to have hit singles, the Jackson Five to have a Saturday morning cartoon show, and opened the way for the Bay City Rollers and the Partridge Family.It's sugary sweet pop but it still rocks; a blend I find spine-tingling.So...why didn't Edison Lighthouse have any other hits?Judging by this &quot;Best of&quot; collection, it's because they were a terrible, terrible band.Songs like &quot;She Works In A Woman's Way,&quot; What's Happening,&quot; and &quot;Find Mr. Zebedee&quot; give pretension a new lease on life.A couple of things here, most notably &quot;Take A Little Time,&quot; sure sound like they were recorded for some Saturday morning cartoon. But, in the end, they're all totally forgettable.

Speaking as a huge Townshend/Who fan, I think I'm qualified to say that this album is dissapointing at best.Townshend sounds good, and the show was probably great if you were in the building, but listening to Pete strum some old favorites gets a little dull.He is the best, when he's with a band. And you know which band I mean.By the way, I didn't find the &quot;bonus disc&quot; to be much of a bonus: there's less than 11 minutes of music on it.Try &quot;Deep End Live&quot; instead--it's a great live Townshend CD.

This may be the Grateful Dead LP for people who don't like the Dead.I know I qualify as a NON-Deadhead. I just never got it; the whole concept of 45-minute guitar solos, two-drummers, and what sure appeared to be a lot of soft rock hype never drew me in. I heard at least three different live Dead recordings, and I was bored stiff by them all.That said, this is one great album, which I have listened to thousands of times and tried to turn all my friends on to for years.Like Garcia's forays into bluegrass (see the forgotten classic OLD AND IN THE WAY), this album displays a band taking its time, relaxing in a group of songs that sound like American standards.There is a warmth to this album that makes you feel like a welcome friend. It's rural without being redneck, warm without being sappy, relaxed without being boring.

I've spent a lot of time working up this nine word synopsis of Coulter's book, so don't skip it:&quot;I hate everyone who thinks differently than I do.&quot;Coulter's final solution--generally implied, occassionally spelled out--is that people she considers inferior need to be economically crippled, removed from society, deported or, when all else fails, executed.She's really quite an intellectual.According to Coulter, disagreeing with her or questioning other conservatives is &quot;slander.&quot; Coulter argues that disagreeing with her or the politicians she's carrying water for is an attack on America, the Bill of Rights, the Bible, and all other things good and, according to Coulter, there is no penalty too severe for those who have differing opinions.I understand Joseph Stalin thought Coulter was scary.

Remember when you were a kid and you'd find some great music, something so cool you couldn't play it enough? And then your dad, trying to make a connection with you and seem cool, would start to hum the tune around the house, even though he really had no interest in the music at all and, in fact, hated it to his core?Well, here's a whole album of your dad humming.

An amazing film. The AFI ranking, 34th, is absurd. This is easily one of the 10 best American films ever made.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD does the impossible: makes a family film out of an unflinching look at racism and a rape trial. That is, I suppose, what makes it so powerful: it walks the line behind the lazy summer days of Jem and Scout's childhood, and the hard truths of their father's courtroom drama. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD brings back the joys and the pains of childhood more accurately than any film I've ever seen.Gregory Peck plays an unforgettable Atticus Finch, and all of the supporting players, including the children, are great. Elmer Berstein's soundtrack is superb.

This is an interesting little LP, but don't be fooled into thinking it's great country music.Does Charlie Daniels play on the LP? Yes. Charlie Daniels played on everybody's records at the time, he was a fairly important studio musician.Does Ringo sing well? Relatively speaking. I'm a great Ringo fan, but to say he croons like George Jones is to ignore reality. Ringo croons like Ringo.Are these great country tunes? Hardly. Ringo was a fan of the syrupy country popular at the time, which had more to do with Glen Campbell and Donna Fargo than anything else.As much as I like Ringo--and I like Ringo a lot--I've always found this LP to be more of a curiosity than anything else.It's better than Keith Moon's solo stuff, but is that really a complement?

Sinatra's voice is oddly restrained throughout SINATRA-BASIE, but Count Basie and his band perform so many miracles here that I have to count this CD as one of my favorites.The swing here is subtle and infectious. Basie--who for some reason is overlooked in many of these reviews--check the title and the credits, folks, it's equal billing--proves his mastery of swing on these cuts. &quot;I Won't Dance,&quot; where Sinatra barely raises his voice above a soft voche, swings hard without drowning the man; Basie's piano intro to &quot;My Kind Of Girl&quot;--and the great drum roll after Sinatra sings &quot;she walks like an angel walks&quot; demonstrate a band confident of it's abilities, and not intimated by their vocalist.

I bought this while studying screenwriting, assuming that owning ANNIE HALL and MANHATTAN would somehow deliver upon me some kind of ability, perhaps a bit of greatness via osmoseous (sp?).I was wrong.I also realized that MANHATTAN is based more on the visual than I had realized--the script, while great, isn't on the same level as ANNIE HALL; INTERIORS, which dissapointed me on the screen is a very good script; and--this just confirmed what I already knew--ANNIE HALL is a great great GREAT film.Did I mention that ANNIE HALL is a great film?

Any comparison between the Psychedelic Furs and the Sex Pistols is mind-blowingly stupid. They were from different planets.Believe it or not, when I hung out at Washington DC clubs like The Wax Museum during the 1980s, Furs music seemed rather romantic. The Pistols were dead by then--literally and figuratively--and you could never by any stretch of the imagination call anything they touched romance-driven. I loved the Pistols, but they were a social movement, the soundtrack to a riot, not dance music or something you'd put on the car stereo as you polished your make out moves.But "Pretty In Pink" was fun and young and fast and danceable; Rolling Stone may have insisted that it was an attack on the highschool mainstream but we all understood it to be a whacked bit of praise for the pretty girl who had more behind her blush than a wish to be a varsity cheerleader; if you were 18 and in those clubs you knew there were a lot of Pretty in Pink types--male and female--hiding on those dance floors. I may be waxing too poetic, but it was amazing to see how many Perfect n' Pure people ended up moving their hips to this kind of thing."Love My Way" and "Heaven" and "The Ghost In You" created an atmosphere that I've never found duplicated, where all of these young suburban kids were able to transpose themselves into some kind of hip ultra-modern netherworld, and the fact that the Furs and a lot of other bands like them sang in Ziggy Stardust drones, played a lot of dry electric synths, and made even human drummers sound pre-programmed had a lot to do with that other-world feel. Too much Vodka and who knows what all else didn't dampen the feeling either. Here in DC we had the premier alt radio station, the now long-defunct WHFS 102.3, driving the scene, and everything you ever saw in Valley Girl and Pretty In Pink---and Rock n Roll High School and Square Pegs and Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Geeks & Freaks and, later, High Fidelity and Almost Famous---was all true. We listened to "Until She Comes" and things like "New Toy" and Cyndi Lauper's awesome cover of "Money Changes Everything" and LONDON CALLING and even Boy George and Marshall Crenshaw and Devo worked their way into the mix. It all seems like another planet now.The break down came when you got past the first tier of tunes for bands like the Furs, when you realized that the annoying squawking on "Heartbeat" sounded way too much like a Duran Duran record, when Madonna and all of the other mall mavens took over the charts, when the Vodka wore off and all of the wonderful dreamscapes of Saturday night just hit a brick wall on Sunday morning. I got tired of trying to make the transformation from my oh-so-cool 2 a.m. Wax Museum persona to somebody who could get out of bed and make a cup of coffee before lunch.So the Furs and a thousand other bands like them are now just a reflective bit of their former selves, and my generations former lives. Both have a glittery patina, but the shine is thin; shallow and hollow and, in too many ways, in the end, meaningless.

The warmth and self-depricating humor of A NOD'S AS GOOD AS A WINK TO A BLIND HORSE has always made it my favorite Faces LP, but the swagger and jammy feeling of LONG PLAYER puts it close to the top of the list as well.On LONG PLAYER the Faces sound more bluesy, more British (as opposed to the Irish tilt of A NOD'S AS GOOD AS A WINK...) and at times more like Rod Stewart's handpicked touring band. Ronnie Lane stands out with a couple of great tunes, a shared vocal with Rod on a great cover of McCartney's classic &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed,&quot; and his always wonderful bass, the spine of all Faces records.This was back in the days when Rod Stewart still had some soul and could sing English Folk, Rock, R&amp;B and Pub tunes all on the same album without missing a step. He's in fine form here, as he was on most Faces records, all his Jeff Beck stuff and all of his own stuff right up to FOOT LOOSE &amp; FANCY FREE. He couldn't pull off a fun-time gem like &quot;Had Me A Real Good Time&quot; today to save his life; it remains one of my all-time favorite Faces tunes.You can't go wrong with any FACES LP, and LONG PLAYER is definitely in the upper tier.

I'm one of the lucky thousands who saw Neil Young on the tour where he recorded RUST NEVER SLEEPS and, never having been much of a fan of his prior to that, it was an eye-opener.The first set, like the first side of this LP, was the acoustic Neil everyone knew. But when amps began to hum and the lights came up for the second set, you knew you were about to experience something different.Crazy Horse, the most under-rated live act in Rock history, roared--and I do mean ROARED--through the set. Young's guitar was blazing, just shooting off those odd licks of his like little bolts of lightning.That concert is perfectly reflected on RUST NEVER SLEEPS. These are some of Young's best songs, especially &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;Powderfinger.&quot; And Crazy Horse is the thunder to Young's lightning.I've never cared as much about the supposed social commentary so many critics see in this album as I do about his argument and his plea for artistic freedom. Young was something of a moving target in the 1960s and early 1970s, doing acoustic and electric folk, folk-rock, and some protest music. What I hear him saying on RUST NEVER SLEEPS is that an artist has to force his own growth, experiment and take chances, or he'll end up producing nothing or, worse yet, producing pablum (are you listening, Graham Nash?). Since RUST NEVER SLEEPS, Young has made techno, rockabilly, country, heavy metal, and avante garde records. Some have been great, some have been failed experiments. But Young has been the most courageous and sincere artists of the era, and deserves the credit grunge rockers have given him. He has remained true.By the way--can we not call him a great American rock star? He's Canadian.

Though not as good as A NOD'S AS GOOD AS A WINK TO A BLIND HORSE, OOH LA LA is fine LP from one of my favorite bands.Rod Stewart may not like OOH LA LA because it is the Faces album that most highlights other band members, and he didn't get to suck up his usual percentage of the glory.Ronnie Lane and Ron Wood, Ian MacLagen, the actual musicians in the Faces, cruise through this LP. Lane, in particular, is in his element, turning out the kind of songs that also shine on his ROUGH MIX project with Pete Townshend.The Faces were good fun, and the fact that Stewart has decided this album is beneath him says more about his disproportionate ego than anything else. Stewart hasn't been one of the boys in decades, and seems to have forgotten that it was the boys who brought him to stardom in the first place.I've loved &quot;Ooh La La&quot; since the first day I heard it, and have performed it live at every lousy club and street corner I've ever performed on. Ronnie's performance on this LP is perfection. Stewart's recent attempt at the tune was lame and, to my ears, an insulting attempt to cash in on his former bandmate's lesser success. Stewart didn't diss &quot;Ooh La La&quot; when he remade it or when he collected the royalty checks from it's use in that stupid TV advertisement.

Five fine musicians peaking musically, three young songwriters hitting their stride thematically, and two troubled couples bottoming out romantically, all at exactly the same moment in the same band, only months after making their entrance to the upper echelon of the charts with their previous LP.How could RUMOURS miss?There has never been a finer study of male-female interaction on vinyl, with the exception of Richard & Linda Thompson's SHOOT OUT THE LIGHTS, than RUMOURS. Every base is covered, from both sides of the gender line, and no easy answers are given. As in any devasting breakup--and, from all accounts, the splits of the McVies and Buckingham/Nicks were as intense as they come--fingers are pointed, nerves are frayed, accusations are made, and everyone gets the blame. Apparantly a dreadful time for them all.But for us, what a great, great record. For all the destruction going on in the lives of individual members the band, as a band, just cooks. They surge and soar through "Don't Stop," they throb and ache on "Dreams," "The Chain," and "Gold Dust Woman."Nicks takes a timeout from the over-the-top pop-mysticism she displayed on FLEETWOOD MAC and submerged herself in after RUMOURS to deliver her best performance. John McVie and Mick Fleetwood provide a rock solid bottom and Christine McVie, she of the endless stream of slow ballads, is nearly uptempo.But the star of the hour, the true workhorse of RUMOURS, is Lindsey Buckingham. From the opening lines of "Second Hand News" ("I know there's nothing to say, someone has taken my place...I'm never going back again") this LP swirls around his struggles at the end of his relationship with Nicks. His guitar work, simply flash and finery prior to RUMOURS, is all about guts and lightning now.Despite all of the 'hope for the future' posturing propped up around Fleetwood Mac nostalgia these days, I've always considered "Go Your Own Way" to be their finest moment. The first few moments of the tune are innocent enough--a steady strum from Buckingham's guitar, even a bit of acoustic harmony--but then something goes wrong:"If loving you isn't the right thing to do..." and McVie and Fleetwood enter, their drums and bass sounding like thunder on the horizon. From there on out it is Buckingham's inner turmoil ("Tell me why everything turned around") and the band is just on fire in the chorus, full throated and full throttle.There's a moment during the guitar solo when the band seems to be trying to hold itself together, to keep from flying off in so many directions, even Buckingham holds back to a few notes...and then the chorus, and this guitar break at the end that is so full of fire and grit and determination that it just brings tears to my eyes. It's the hottest lead I've ever heard on a Pop hit, and it ends with a crash so powerful and so final that it changed my entire opinion of Lindsey Buckingham.To me, "Go Your Own Way" is 3 minutes 31 seconds that sums up so much of the end of that mid-70s California narcissim, so much better than the Eagles ..., that it qualifies as one of the 20 greatest singles of all time.

One of the very best British-invasion bands--and one of the most British--the Kinks never got the US recognition they deserved.Even the lesser-known tunes on KINK KRONIKLES are great: &quot;Willesden Green&quot; covers the same ground as the Stone's &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot; but pre-dates it by more than a decade; &quot;Deadend Street&quot; rocks with a vengance; &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; is downright gorgeous; and on and on and on.If the Kinks had been handled by Brian Epstien instead of Shel Talmy, who knows? With Ray Davies Pop songwriting ability and Dave Davies vicious guitar playing, anything could have happened. If the Kinks had avoided their dispute with American union workers, maybe the US would have heard more from this great band.The Kinks are practically forgotten in the US now, except for occasional play on &quot;oldies&quot; radio and bits of &quot;Lola&quot; being used in commercials. It's a shame, because they were a great band.Treat yourself to this wonderful CD, which shows off all the charm and elloquence of the Kinks during their artistic hayday.

Ok, "Hee-Haw" was one of the oddest shows in television history, with the worst one-liners this side of Benny Hill. But the music--and keep in mind this is coming from a one-time Rock purist--the music on "Hee-Haw" was just about the best ever seen on American television.The original hosts were Roy Clark--he of the syrupy slow songs and cheesey infomercial guitar course, but a consumate instrumentalist--and Buck Owens, who was a revolutionary country star before Dwight Yoakum or Wynona Judd were born.This album, which finds its way to the top of my play pile more often than I admit to my old Rocker friends, is supurb from beginning to end.It's a very good band, but the secret ingredient is the excellent guitarist, Don Rich, who combines melody and twang masterfully.

A beautiful album, full of yearning and passion and longing and desperate searches for love.&quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; is a wonderful, wonderful song, and might be the radio entre to the LP, but it is the quieter tunes that show off Carpenter's amazing pipes.There are those who will toss aside &quot;Only A Dream&quot; or &quot;Not Too Much To Ask&quot; as mere 'chick songs,' but there is tooo much soul in Carpenter's voice, too much emotion in her lyrics, to dismiss her like that. And anyone who doesn't get it by the end of the title track is just heartless.Here in the Washington DC area we're very possesive of hometown hero Mary-Chapin Carpenter. But we'll let you listen too. Just this once.

Like all of the BBC Sessions, the Who's disc gives you a lot of what you want, but you have to put up with a lot too.Announcer chat was a neccesity at the time, but it's a bit offensive all these years later to have Dennis Owen (or whovever it was) chatting up the tunes while they're being played.That said, the Who kicks on this CD. "Substitute" is about a half beat faster than you've heard it before, "Pictures Of Lily" has a great organ part halfway down in the mix, "I'm Free" is amazing (this is where Dennis Owen really needed to take a coffee break), and "Shakin' All Over" is blistering."Long Live Rock," on the other hand, is a mistake that shouldn't have been included here. The vocals are brassy and were obviously dubbed over the pre-recorded instrument tracks included in the studio version of the song.I always get a cold chill listening to the Radio 1 jingles made from "My Generation" and "Boris The Spider." Call me stodgy, but I don't like to hear these early indications of advertisers eagerness to prostitute Rock; I nearly go into conniptions every time I see the commerical where the Overture from TOMMY advertises sinus medicine.

Yes, the Rutles TV special was very funny, but don't let that distract you from the top-notch Pop on this CD. I like it so much that my band used to cover &quot;I Must Be In Love.&quot;The production is a bit sparse at times, but the great Neil Innes injects enough energy and wit into every tune to carry them through the thinner moments.&quot;Goose-Step Mama,&quot; &quot;Number One,&quot; and some of the other 'early' Rutles stuff is good, but when Innes hits the band's 'middle' and 'late' periods--beginning with &quot;Doubleback Alley&quot;--he whips off a few near-classics. &quot;Piggy In the Middle,&quot; starts as a baltent rip-off of &quot;I Am The Walrus,&quot; but Innes adds a melodic turn that makes it the Rutles own. &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Cheese &amp; Onions&quot; recall 1970-ish McCartney and Lennon without ridiculing either.Which is, of course, the secret to the Rutles greatness: Innes &amp; Eric Idle were great fans--and great friends--of the Beatles. Imitation may be the greatest form of flattery, but it takes a real fan to do it right.By the way, there are those of us who have argued for years that, if the Beatles had ever wanted to get back together post-1980, Neil Innes was the obvious choice for a fourth.As for the eternal question--will the Rutles ever get back together--I think Mick Jagger put it best:&quot;I hope not.&quot;

It is the most interesting album I've heard in years; beautiful, melodic, though provoking, occasionally funky, and light years ahead of the rest of the pack. Over the past few years only Wilco's YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT comes close to the sonic effect of this record. From the opening robot announcement (&quot;The test begins...NOW&quot;) to the closing sighs as the interstellar balloon touches ground in &quot;Utopia Planitia,&quot; YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS is like nothing you've ever heard before; it is mind altering in the very best connotation of the phrase.The real world optimism and thematic scope of late 60s concept albums, the far-thrown experimentalism of mid-career Pink Floyd, the delicacy and patience of the best Neil Young, the cosmic trippiness of Frank Zappa, the melodic traditionalism of the finest McCartney, and some of the coolest rhythm-based Bass guitar playing you'll ever hear, all on one record. It's way cool, intelligent and just great, great music.The day YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS showed up in my mailbox I worked 15 straight hours putting my newspaper to bed. Going home that night I drove around for an extra 30 minutes, just so I could listen to this record all the way through. I didn't want it to end.I never want it to end. It is, without any doubt, the best record of the last year; one of the three or four best--along with YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT and Aimee Mann's BACHELOR NO. 2--of the past decade, and an overlooked classic of the Rock era.Five stars doesn't even begin to cover it.

What a revalation SINATRA/JOBIM is.Released during one of the commercial low-points in Sinatra's decades-long career, with the COB co-billed with an artist virtually unheard of in mainstream America, relying heavily on a rhythm considered even at the height of its popularity little better than a novelty in the US, SINATRA/JOBIM is never the less one of the finest artistic statements of Sinatra's recording career.There are moments of such delicacy and subtle beauty on this LP that, I suppose, radio just didn't have the patience to let them develop on air. This was 1968, after all, and there wasn't much room for something as calm, quiet, and downright gorgeous as &quot;Dindi&quot; or &quot;Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars&quot; when the Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape had new LPs coming out, man.Too bad for us, because SINATRA/JOBIM bombed at the record stores, very few people heard it, and a beautiful effort was rewarded by deaf ears. This is one of the highlights of Sinatra's late-middle period. Snatch it up.

The photos I've taken with my Coolpix 5000 are pretty good, though it has a lot of trouble adjusting to indoor lighting, even with the $100 Nikon SB-30 flash attachment.But this can be a VERY frustrating camera to use. Besides the now-standard but always annoying delay built into virtually any piece of digital equipment (I thought digital was going to make things faster, not slower, didn't you?), the Coolpix 5000 will often just decide it's taken enough pictures for now, thank you very much, and it will do nothing more.I've gone over and over the instruction manual and can find no hint as to what to do in this situation. I am focused, I have checked lighting, I have my settings correct, I push the button...and then I push it again...and then I push it again, and then again, and again and again and again, and then I hold it down until my finger hurts, and then I just want to throw the stupid camera in front of an asphalt truck. Nothing happens. If I turn it off and then back on, nothing happens. If I turn it off and leave it alone for 24 hours, then it usually is ready to have fun again.Surprisingly, the kids have lost interest in posing for pictures and are getting a little cranky after waiting 24 hours for the camera to get its act together.

Hard as it is to believe, what with the wealth of wonderful music the Beatles gave the world in their relatively short career, some of their music was overlooked.A record as great as &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; for instance--a thumping tribute to piano-pounding sound of Fats Domino--leapt up the charts, but was set aside when the WHITE ALBUM, LET IT BE, ABBEY ROAD LPs, LET IT BE film, and another stack of singles quickly overtook it. &quot;Revolution&quot; got lost in the backwash from the equally masterful &quot;Hey Jude.&quot; And &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; one of the best tunes Lennon ever recorded, seemed to be released into an empty room; it throbs and rocks and rolls like nobody's business but never made anybody's 'favorites' list.PAST MASTERS was produced by George Martin, which means you get pure Beatles music as the it was meant to be heard.

Billy Preston didn't release a big mountain of music, but he hung out with the big boys of Rock during the late '60's and '70's, became the only man credited with playing on a Beatle's LP (even Clapton's great solo on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; went unacknowledged) and released a series of jumping singles that sound as fresh today as they did 30 years ago.What surprised me after all these years was how many of these tunes I knew but had never realized were written/played by Preston. The instrumental &quot;Outa-Space&quot; sounds like it was pulled off an old Average White Band record (or the soundtrack to the old animated Cosby show &quot;Fat Albert&quot;). And who knew that Billy Preston wrote &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;?The two big hits, &quot;Will It Go Round In Circles&quot; and &quot;Nothing From Nothing&quot; are first class Pop, but Preston's true shining moment was &quot;That's The Way God Planned It.&quot; A truly great song.

1950s English and American popular music were light years apart. I'm not saying that one or the other was better or worse, they were just different, different, different.Try to imagine people in New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles, who were seeing Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Patti Page, Dean Martin, etc etc etc on a fairly regular basis, putting Lonnie Donegan on the turntable, and hearing that key-bending introduction to &quot;Jack O'Diamonds.&quot;Boom! Worlds collide.Lennon said skiffle was a revolution in England, much like the Folk movement which went through America in the late fifties and early sixties. Neither hung around for very long--skiffle was nothing more than a memory by 1964, and Folk was an affect, rather than a movement, in Pop by 1966--but the influence hung around a bit longer.I prefer the Lonnie Donegan records that aren't pulled directly out of American songbooks. Those are kind of like hearing Elvis doing the French National Anthem, if you follow me.So my highlights here are &quot;Putting On The Style,&quot; &quot;My Old Man's A Dustman,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Does Your Chewing Gum Lose It's Flavor (On The Bedpost Over Night)?&quot; They remind me of a time when pop stars--English ones, at least--were allowed to have a sense of humor.And, if you really want to hear an authentic Pub sing-a-long song, you can't beat &quot;Have A Drink On Me.&quot; Like all good Brit-singers, it drops from major to minor in the bridge, includes a few chuckles, and revolves around the impending death of the narrator. What could be better?Some of these tracks could be buried at sea and nobody would miss them much. But, for the price this CD is going for, it's well worth it to hear the gems.

I enjoyed this book, but I think some of the praise here and on the back cover is a tad overblown.I think McLaurin is a good writer, and &quot;Keeper Of The Moon&quot; is a good book. He spends a lot of time recreating conversations he didn't witness, or was just too young to remember, but that's a quibble. This is the kind of book a lot of us say we're going to write, but all too few of us ever get around to doing it.But I have trouble with McLaurin and other &quot;southern&quot; writers who dip into fits of that reverse-snobbery they call &quot;southern pride.&quot; Being from the south myself (Virginia, admittedly not the deep south but the home of the Presidents and Robert E. Lee, don't ya know---I do say &quot;ya'll&quot; several times a day), I still don't understand the theory that dying in needless hunting and drunken driving accidents, having children while still in middle school, getting in knife fights, or living in poverty because you spend all your money on booze, drugs, and hookers is somehow a proud tradition. Call me crazy, but I think there's a lot more to the south, or any other part of the country, than that.

A shockingly good record, YOUR ARSENAL is packed with ferocious latter-day Glam. It's a big guitar record--and they're good guitar songs--but I would have preferred a bit more of the Pop sensibility found on other Morrisey records.To me, after the roar of much of the rest of the record, &quot;We'll Let You Know,&quot; a sad little ditty about lost empire, is the best thing on the record.

My entre' into the coolest, and least succesful, band I was ever in was a 15-minute guitar solo I played on a spontanious version of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll.&quot; We ended up playing nothing but Velvet Underground, Dylan and Clash covers.We were terrible. Really awful.LOADED appears to have been an attempt by the Velvets to step out from under the mega-hype that had surrounded their first few records (some of that hype machine remains in place; according to the linear notes, LOADED is &quot;one of the greatest rock 'n roll albums ever recorded&quot;) and maybe get a hit. No number ones here, although there are a couple minor classics.I refuse to call any album produced as shabbily as this a great record. If Lou Reed was half as tough as his dwindling number of supporters love to say he is, he would have taken whoever was responsible for the horrible drop-in acoustic guitar solo on &quot;Who Loves The Sun,&quot; and whoever allowed Reeds off-key vocal on &quot;Train Around The Bend,&quot; or whoever decided to put the lame backing vocals on &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; at the front of the mix, and he would have put those people in front of a firing squad.This could have been a great LP, I suppose, but it's really just an interesting one.

A surprisingly dull and unimaginative group of dance tracks.I was introduced to Natacha Atlas' music through her album GEDIDA, which included a lively and varied mix of music. It seems to me that she's sold short by dj's who believe she should be used as one of a handful of instruments on these tracks, which are all glorified drum-machine solos with Atlas and synth-strings turned down low in the mix. I don't really think this qualifies as a Natacha Atlas album since her voice is only employed as a gimmick.I really can't even pinpoint one or the other of these tracks as a highlight; except for differences in tempo they are virtually indistinguishable from each other.

A co-worker brought me a cassette version of this gorgeous LP after she returned to India for her sisters wedding. All I knew of Indian music at that point was the brilliance of Ravi Shankar and the tinny sound of movie soundtracks.Don't get me wrong, I love Shankar. This is another avenue, and in some ways a more peaceful one, into Indian classic music. Shankar seems (to my poorly trained American ear) more structured, more cosmopolitan; Call of The Valley has a more agrarian feel to it.On a side note, I find it endlessly amusing that the closing track on the cassette, Rag Pahadi, is based on a three-tone motif identical to the cheesy 1950s-American single &quot;Baby Face.&quot;

After two decades of not being quite sure what my opinion of Aerosmith was, I finally broke down and bought this CD two weeks ago.I can't stop listening to it.There are some odd things here--for example, how come &quot;Make It&quot; is so good, even though Joe Perry's guitar solo is not quite in tune and is totally out of time? Is he playing along with a different song? And who did the lousy overdubbed lead guitar on &quot;Somebody&quot;? It's played bad and edited even worse. And what's with the goofy intro to the great &quot;Walkin' The Dog&quot;?The real revalation, after years of hearing nothing but talk of coke addictions and internal squabbling associated with Aerosmith, is how fun and downright optimistic this band can be. &quot;Make It,&quot; &quot;Dream On,&quot; even &quot;Mama Kin,&quot; all sound to me like declarations of independence and musical freedom from Steven Tyler. In it's best moments, this album doesn't just rock; it SWINGS.&quot;Dream On&quot; is pure magic--and inspired, too, because there is nothing else here with the same level of musical sophistication--and it hasn't been rendered impotent by radio overkill the way that contemporaries like &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; or &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot; were.I'm shocked to find that this record is carried NOT by Joe Perry--most gorups of the genre lean so heavily on lead guitarists--but by by bassist Tom Hamilton and (I spent years trying to avoid saying these words) the GREAT Steven Tyler.I've spent two weeks listening to this, two weeks searching for the word to describe Tylers vocals, and I keep coming back to my initial adjective: MUSCULAR.My god the guy can sing. He makes me feel strong and macho just listening to him. Trust me, that's saying a lot.I loved the Rocks LP years ago, but even that album didn't display the guys throat like this CD. He could do ANYTHING at this point, and they were fresh off the bar circuit. He was what--20?--and gave Jagger a run for his money, right out of the box.I hate to admit it, but you can now count me among the Aerosmith clan.Rats.

This LP proves beyond any doubt that Nirvana was more than Kurt Cobain. Without Dave Grohl at the drum kit, Nirvana sounds like a thousand other grungy metal bands. The sound on BLEACH is more raw and less powerful than on the big label Grohl-drummed records that the band would do later.Still, Cobain was a certifiable Rock genius and the formula that he would perfect on NEVERMIND can be heard on &quot;Downer&quot; and &quot;About A Girl,&quot; which resurfaced on UNPLUGGED a few years later. &quot;Love Buzz&quot; sounds faintly psychedelic, but the overall vibe here is young, fast, and razor sharp.But I gotta wonder...who is this &quot;Kurdt Kobain&quot; mentioned on the album's credits? Kurt Cobain's bizzaro world twin?

There was a time, not too long ago, when the Rhino label was ridiculed because it wasted a lot of time and effort releasing oddities that nobody needed--triple-disc box sets from one-hit wonders and the like--but, for my money, Rhino has become one of the most important labels in the industry.That's because they have turned their attention to saving some forgotten classics from the dustbin. And don't kid yourself for a second, though it may never have been heard on LP-format FM radio when it was released in a more abbreviated format in 1973 (though it is one of Franklin's best selling LPs), AMAZING GRACE is one of the absolute classics of it's time, a chunky R&amp;B treatment of Gospel by thE Queen of Soul.Aretha Franklin ranks with Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald as one of the all-time great American singers, and this CD showcases her amazing pipes in a perfect setting: piano, organ, a bit of drums and guitar, but mostly the power of Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir carrying things along. The mix gives Franklin room to breathe and move. The result is one of the earthiest albums you'll ever hear.&quot;How I Got Over&quot; is a real Southern Baptist shouter, but it's the tunes that start off in a gentle slide that most clearly demonstrate Franklin's mastery: &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone,&quot; &quot;What A Friend We Have In Jesus,&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;There's even a great instrumental, Baptized version of George Harrison's &quot;My Sweet Lord.&quot;This is a tour de force which everyone should own, and one of my all-time favorite records.

To my ears TUG OF WAR is one of McCartney's greatest records, on the same level as BAND ON THE RUN and MCCARTNEY.For once, Macca is taking on more than boy-girl lovey-dovey issues, and he hits them right on the head. Macca is philosophical, and sees no easy answers. It's an album about struggle, artistic freedom, inspiration, and the realization of a lost past.And, best of all, it's produced by George Martin, which means there isn't any of the musical farting around found on some other McCartney LPs.&quot;Tug Of War&quot; is majestic, &quot;Take It Away&quot; swings. &quot;Somebody Who Cares&quot; is in the line of great 'chin-up' McCartney tunes--&quot;there's always someone somewhere, you should know by now, always somebody who cares.&quot;&quot;Ballroom Dancing&quot; is just a great, great record, a lot like the Kinks &quot;Gone Dancing,&quot; with one of Macca's finest vocal performances. He's all over the scale here, and playes quite the jangling piano to boot.And then there's &quot;Wanderlust.&quot; I would suggest that critics of this song, who were quick to call it just another McCartney MOR tune, listen to it with open ears. It's the emotional core of the album, a tune about searching for a new beginning and, for those who wish McCartney would be more autobiographical, contains the line: &quot;Light out Wanderlust [the name of Macca's boat], head us out to sea. Captain says there'll be a bust, this one's not for me.&quot; The horns soar, the guitars shimmer, and the song is perfect.

It's a shame EMI has let this compilation slip out of print. Because, despite the disdain that &quot;real&quot; classic music fans have for this kind of record, BEST-LOVED CLASSICS 2 is a fine collection of some outstanding pieces.In addition to some well-known Rossini, Mozart, Sibelius, and Handel, there's the incredible Nun's Chorus &amp; Laura's Aria from Strauss's Casanova, one of the most moving pieces ever composed.IF this CD comes back on the market, snatch it up. Great performances, well recorded, and a chance to hear some great pieces you may not often hear elsewhere.

While I enjoy this CD, I have to say the reconfiguration done when converting it from LP to CD was a terrible hatchet job.When Tull was good they were--dare I say it?--magical. The first 11 tracks on this CD, along with &quot;Wond'ring Again&quot; and &quot;Hymn 43&quot; deliver that kind of magic. But the live tracks are ponderous, and I can't believe no one at Chrysalis considered dumping them to leave &quot;Teacher&quot; and the masterful &quot;Bouree&quot; on instead. If something needed to be cut to fit the LP on CD, it sure shouldn't have been Jethro Tulls best-ever recording.Still, this is a CD worth owning. Tull was unique, totally British and always more focused on making great music than many of their contemporaries.

Often overlooked in the mountain of superlatives thrown at Clapton's electric &amp; psychedelic blues is his acoustic playing--maybe because he hadn't shown it off on more than a hand full of tracks prior to 1992's UNPLUGGED.Even more impressive than his tasty picking on this CD is his singing. Like Townshend and George Harrison, Clapton has masked his usually unimpressive voice behind other singers and his own guitar, but here his is flawless. His voice is warm, smoky, emotional, and completely relaxed. &quot;Running On Faith&quot; and &quot;Old Love,&quot; in particular, are the works of a masterful singer, one I hadn't recognized until this LP was released.Clapton supposedly didn't like the Unplugged concept and didn't think his performance was particularly good. I guess even Picasso had days when he thought he was a piker.It turns my stomach to admit that anything coming out of MTV is of any quality whatsoever, but this is one great CD.

If the liner notes to SINATRA IN PARIS are to be believed--and there's no reason they shouldn't be--Sinatra slapped this sextet together quickly and never rehearesed on the road.The result is a near-perfect set of sultry bar tunes, more intimate than SINATRA AT THE SANDS but still a bigger sound than SONGS FOR ONLY THE LONELY. The Voice is in primal condition, the band is loose but on target, and the material is superb mid-career Sinatra.As for the banter that everyone is so hep to denigrade...this is a Vegas performer doing a Vegas act before an uppercrust white Parisian audience in 1962. What did you expect--Jerry Seinfeld? Sinatra was what he was and, in all fairness to the COB, his white-and-black give and take with Sammy Davis Jr., which seems rather backward and cold today, was seen as a great step forward in the late 1950s, when Step'n'fetchit and the Kingfish were still pretty popular stereotypes.Don't buy it for the rift Sinatra had just ripped with the Kennedys, don't buy it for mafia rumour or supposed racial slights; buy SINATRA IN PARIS for the great, great music it contains, and the powerful Voice that bowled over the world for six decades.

Sammy Davis Jr ruined his reputation by playing the ultra-cool hipster with a 4-inch cigarette, high heels and day-glo feather boas for most of the 1970s. It's a shame he's most remembered as the target of Billy Crystal's rather lame humor, instead of as the incredible singer he really was.His versions of &quot;Begin The Beguine&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; on THE WHAM OF SAM are classics, and, as the linear notes boast, Davis holds his own with a select group of jazz musicians.This is cigarette-and-whiskey Jazz, and a fine batch of it.

Such a great record, but nobody seems to know it exists.I had the Now Look LP for about 2 years before I could ever convince myself to leave Side 1 and check out Side 2. Side 2 is pretty good--but I still don't leave Side 1 very often. The first four tracks, in particular, are outstanding.What to say about &quot;Breath On Me,' except that it was in my all-time top 20--and that's without being able to decipher some of the lyrics.That song, and in fact the entire record, sound more like the Faces &quot;Ooh La La&quot; than the Stones &quot;Some Girls,&quot; but I can see that comparison too.Don't buy this record expected to hear much Keith Richards, though he does appear, mostly singing harmony and a bit of slide on a couple of tracks. This is a Faces LP without Rod Stewart, not a Stones record without Mick.Buy it and love it.

Despite the attempt at a 'just us folks' attitude--the liner notes are written by third-rate country singers the Statler Brothers, for some reason--this is a very English album. Aside from the fact that the choirs are from Cambridge, Paisley Abbey, St. Marks Church North Audley Street, the Royal School of Church Music and others, the inclusion of &quot;All Things Bright And Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Crown Him With Many Crowns&quot; leave the impression of a fine service in an English country church.I disagree with the assessment that this is somehow a sonically challenged recording. It sounds as if you're in the 12th row of a mid-December service, and that is as it should be.

This, I imagine, is what Vegas sounded like in the years when Vegas was really VEGAS. It's whiskey-and-cigarette two a.m. music at it's most dramatic.&quot;Lush Life&quot; meanders a bit, but &quot;A Stranger In Town&quot; begins to pick up the pace, and Davis begins to pull out the stops on &quot;What Kind Of Fool Am I.&quot;&quot;I've Gotta Be Me&quot; is an absolute masterpiece, a powerful cry of self-impowerment that is as stirring today as it was upon it's release. Is it a tad over-dramatic? Maybe--after all, it's a Broadway tune. But, for those of us who got downright nauseous listening to &quot;Candy Man&quot; four million times, &quot;I've Gotta Be Me&quot; is a revelation, a vocal so big and full of life that it just can't be overlooked. It's old-style Hollywood, old-time Vegas.By the way--anybody else remember watching Davis shoot his six-guns on the old Merv Griffin show? That was great stuff.

I've always thought that the best way to hear McCartney might be sitting around the fire with acoustic guitars, a couple of mates, and an icebucket of Guiness. This album is as close to that setting as I'm ever likely to get.Macca occasionaly dips into his bottomless bag of self-penned Pop standards--&quot;Here There And Everywhere,&quot; &quot;We Can Work It Out,&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot;--and they're well done, except &quot;And I Love Her,&quot; which is downright angelic here, even better than the original Beatles version found on HARD DAY'S NIGHT.But on the other selections, McCartney really lets down his hair, so to speak, and has a darn good time. The result is a fun, loose LP, one that I ended up liking a lot more than I ever would have expected.One note: Macca does &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues,&quot; a tune Clapton also includes on his UNPLUGGED album. It's a good tune, and Macca and Clapton both do rollicking versions--but am I the only one who is surprised that this old Ramblin' Jack Elliot tune made it onto both LPs?

Much of this collection can be found on THE SPECIALS, the first LP by the greatest Ska band of my generation.Get it because "Ghost Town," written about London after Ska-concert violence had caused the authorities to begin the clampdown on clubs and bands left town for the studio or the States, is the all-time greatest Specials single."Free Nelson Mandela" is dated, for obvious reasons, but it is the obvious and admireable outcome of The Specials, and Ska's, cross-racial harmony. I didn't notice the Pistols or Ozzy Osborne doing much for the battle against aparthied, for instance.

The Mamas &amp; The Papas were all over the artistic map. At Monterrey Pop--a festival Papa John Phillips was instrumental in organizing--they rocked. Yet, on many of their records they sound like a really tight Glee Club performing at your high school talent show.&quot;Monday Monday&quot; and &quot;California Dreaming&quot; are Pop classics, but &quot;My Girl&quot; and &quot;Dancing In The Street&quot; are embarassing covers; &quot;I Saw Her Again Last Night&quot; is a personal and powerful rocker, while &quot;Got A Feelin'&quot; is a meandering bit of drivel.So this is an up and down album. Thank heavens for &quot;Dream A Little Dream Of Me,&quot; Mama Cass's little piece of perfection that can't be heard enough. She was a vastly under-rated singer (though she also appears to have been the member who pushed to have most of the questionable material put into the band's playlist), and this is her finest moment.

Maybe I've always taken Elton John too personally. I remember in grade school and junior high, even into high school in the late 1970s, thinking--hoping, I suppose--that he had somehow picked up and put on the crown of Pop dropped by the Beatles in 1970. Those first few years of his career, when he was averaging an LP every 8 months and two hits per LP, it was hard not to think that this was the man who would save popular music.But, after an unprecedented series of great Pop LPs, he tripped. He stopped writing with Bernie Taupin, he fell into the drink and drug trap and, to paraphrase Elton himself, he got fat and lazy and stupid. Listening to his daliances with disco, funk, and some of the blandest Pop of the 1980s and 90's, all those drecky duets and contract fulfilling-CDs, I really thought we'd all seen the end of Elton. The bug-eyed wonderboy whose poster hung on Valerie Bertinelli's wall, who sang "Crocodile Rock" on a shiny new 45 at my 6th grade dances, who provided the sweet soundtrack for my adolescence, was no more.Or so I thought.So when I listen to SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST, and hear that wonderfuld warm voice restored, hear those solid melodies that once again seem to flow from a bottomless pool of talent, the tasty production, the effortless hooks, the peerless piano playing, the sterling backing vocals---all of the things that made me fall in love with Elton John records all the way back at the beginning--well, you'll just have to excuse me if I wax poetic. Great Elton John records do that to me. And this is a GREAT Elton John record.When he starts off the album with the bitter sweet reminiscing of "The Emperor's New Clothes," it's hard for me (and a lot of other long time fans, I'm sure) not to once again take Elton John too personally.It's not as sedated as his most recent records, not as rocking as ROCK OF THE WESTIES, but there is something of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, his very best LP, in SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST. There's been a lot of talk of this record sounding like the first ELTON JOHN LP, but I see the reach of YELLOW BRICK ROAD and the sound of HONKY CHATEAU in SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST.It is, I think, an album about redemption and forgiveness and seeing the world for what it is. It isn't sacherine--"American Triangle" is pretty intense stuff, lyrically--but there seems to be a willingness to recognize the harshness of the real world and to still find a way to love.Thank God for Elton John.

The first volume of great juke-box music from the best Country performer of the 1960s and 70s, ALL TIME GREATEST HITS VOLUME 1 hits most of the highs--&quot;Act Naturally,&quot; &quot;Streets of Bakersfield, &quot;Made In Japan,&quot; &quot;Think Of Me,&quot; and the killer &quot;Tiger By The Tail&quot;--and one real clunker, &quot;Big In Vegas.&quot;As with all Owens records, the writing is good, the singing is better, and the guitar playing is flawless.

BACHELOR NO. 2 was my 2000 album of the year, light years ahead of all cometition.Man oh man oh MAN, do I LOVE this LP.Who in rock would have the guts to start an LP with a line like &quot;I can't conceive I'm everything you're trying to make me believe,&quot; as Mann does on &quot;How Am I Different?&quot;? For that matter, how many musicians have the guts to start an LP with a downbeat depresser like &quot;How Am I Different?&quot;?Certainly very few male rockers.It moves and swings in long, low, graceful lines; it is atmospheric without any trendy, triacle oversweetening the mix.Is it depressing? Well, yeh, at points. But it's also witty and smart and the depression is genuine, or at least spoken by someone who obviously knows what she's talking about.&quot;Deathly&quot; is caustic, &quot;Ghost World&quot; roars with a big ol' Stones sound--if the Stones could sing backup so good and sweet--and &quot;You Do&quot; has some of the best singing on a rock record in I don't know how long.I spent two months listening almost exlusively to this LP. It is a real world-changer, a mind-bender with a spine like you've never seen. If I could give it a rating of 35 stars, I would.Now...who decided this flimsy little cardboard scrap was a worthy wrapper for this world-class LP? CD packaging is bad enough as it is, don't start downgrading it now.

PARTY GIRL contains one of my favorite scenes from my all-time favorite sitcom: Lou taking 1/2 of Mary's party platter:&quot;Say. You know what? I'm not as hungry as I thought.&quot;One episode that I would've put in place of the Aunt Flo episode was the party for Lou where he locked everyone out of Mary's apartment (&quot;Aw come on Mr. Grant. Let Rhoda in--you like Rhoda&quot;). Or maybe the party where the power went out just before the guest of honor arrived.But the only real complaint I have about this VHS set is that it isn't enough. If MTM would package every episode on tape, I'd buy the whole thing in a second.

A great film on it's own, PLAY IT AGAIN SAM also lays the groundwork for Allen's two best films, ANNIE HALL and MANHATTAN.A film based on a play that was based on standup routines, PLAY IT AGAIN SAM shows off two Allen favorites, Tony Roberts and the great Diane Keaton.Allen and Keaton's prescription-drug rap comparisons are classic, and the final scene is amazing.

TANA MANA sounds more like an attempt to &quot;westernize&quot; Indian music than the traditional Shankar sound.Gone are the extended ragas, replaced by 3-minute, uptempo tunes. Gone are the tabla-sitar exchanges, replaced by synthesizer coloring.That doesn't mean this is bad stuff. In fact, most of it is very good. This might be the perfect album to introduce western ears to eastern music. &quot;Chase,&quot; &quot;Village Dance,&quot; &quot;Friar Park,&quot; and &quot;Reunion&quot; are stand out tracks.

If this CD is overlooked, as some reviews have said, the reason is pretty obvious: BLACK AND BLUE isn't particularly good.Spotty might be a better description. &quot;Hand Of Fate&quot; and &quot;Crazy Mama&quot; are fine, though hardly classic. I love the fluttering guitars at the end of &quot;Crazy Mama,&quot; which sure sound like an attempt at PHYSICAL GRAFFITI-era Jimmy Page.&quot;Cherry Oh Baby,&quot; &quot;Hey Negrita&quot; and &quot;Melody&quot; all sound like overworked late-night jams, which is exactly what they are. They may have been fun to play, but they aren't much to listen to.&quot;Hot Stuff&quot; is embarassingly bad. I know Mick loved the Euro-discos, and spent much of the 70s and 80s trying to ape their sound, but surely Keith could have blocked this from public release.What to say about &quot;Memory Motel&quot; and &quot;Fool To Cry,&quot; except where did they come from? The piano and vocals on both are beautiful, but who ever saw songs like this coming from the Glimmers? Not exactly &quot;Midnight Rambler,&quot; is it? The Stones got rich trying to make &quot;race records,&quot; but it never works for me when it's as obvious as this.

It's a funny thing. When the Stones are at their worst, as they are here, Keith always drops a real jem into the album that I can't resist.In this case, it's &quot;Coming Down Again.&quot; Like all of the album, the lyrics are all over the place, and the guitars are a bit lazy, but the effect is sweeter than anything else on this misguided record.Some of this--&quot;Dancing With Mr. D,&quot; &quot;Can You Hear The Music,&quot; and &quot;Hide Your Love&quot;--are among the worst recordings of the Stones nearly 40-year career.The fact that a couple of FM-radio staples, &quot;Angie&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; are included doesn't keep this from being a let down of major league proportions.It's unfortunate that &quot;Star Star&quot; was saddled with the dirtiest lyric of the 1970s, making it impossible to get it on the radio, because it is the best thing here. Dirty, raucus, and right on the verge of slipping out of control by records end, it perfectly defines the Stones in the mid-1970s.

A disapiontment.Promoted as a &quot;bizarre&quot; tale, full of &quot;intrigue&quot; and yadda yadda yadda, this is instead a rather dull story of a group of men trudging around, lost, in the jungle. Many of the &quot;details&quot; in the book are pure conjecture by the author.For once in my life I would have to advise renting the video rather than reading the book.

She doesn't have the pipes of some other singers, and she occassionaly slips into a sacherine vein thats a little hard to take, but Wynonna Judd gets it. She knows what music is for, and she knows there's a time for tough, a time for soft, a time to growl, and a time to coo. She GETS IT.And, on just about every record with her mother and on her solo stuff, there is some moment that she sings so perfectly it brings a lump to your throat. "When I Reach The Place I'm Goin'" comes close, but on WYNONNA it is "She Is His Only Need," a tune that would have been pedestrian in the hands of a lesser talent. It's just a corny little thing until she turns the phrase "Boy, ain't that love just something when it's strong enough to keep a man going."She is a masterful, masterful singer, lightyears ahead of her contemporaries.A stodgy selection of tunes, and the dependence on a bland set of backing singers, makes WYNONNA a less than great LP, but her voice makes it all listenable. The best moments are magic.

TELL ME WHY is an odd LP, containing some of the best music Wynnona has recorded--some of the best Pop or Country music of the last 20 years, for that matter--side by side with some of the silliest junk this side of Flock of Seagulls or &quot;Disco Duck.&quot;How do you explain an album that would sandwich a song as flat-out stupid as &quot;Let's Make A Baby King&quot; between two masterpieces, &quot;Only Love&quot; and the wrenching &quot;Is It Over Yet&quot;?How did producer Tony Brown justify recording a tacky novelty record, &quot;Girls With Guitars,&quot; on the same tape with a gem like &quot;I Just Drove By&quot;?Wynonna's voice is, as always, powerful and perfect. She is the best singer country has seen since Patsy Cline, bar none.

A bit schmaltzier than VOL 1, ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 continues the tracking of one of Country's true masters.&quot;Tall Dark Stranger&quot; is horrible, just the kind of sugary-sweet molassas Owens fans think he is above. Luckily, that is one of the few misteps here; tunes like &quot;Love's Gonna Live Here,&quot; &quot;Above &amp; Beyond,&quot; and &quot;Gonna Have Love&quot; are true classics.

Oddly enough, the third installment of Buck Owens ALL TIME GREATEST HITS is the most solid of the series. None of the occasional Las Vegas glitz found here and there on the first two records is in evidence here.The inclusion of &quot;Buckaroo&quot; is a nice touch; be sure to check out INSTRUMENTAL HITS OF BUCK OWENS AND HIS BUCKAROOS for more of their classic guitar pieces.Oh-so-hip America, which turned up it's nose at HEE HAW, never knew what it was missing. Middle America treated itself to some of the best music around every week, while the rest of us waitied for the next Archies single. Buck Owens gave it away on TV all thsoe years, and we looked the other way.

This book has a thorough listing of piano chords presented in a manner that makes it easy enough to reproduce them on your own keyboard.The problem is the physical layout of the book: all the C# chords are on one page, for example; the F# on another, the A on another, the Bm on another, etc etc etc.For a beginner to use the book to help them learn a simple song, they have to either flip pages mid-tune, make photocopies to lay side by side, or memorize the different chords before playing. That's fine in the long term, but I know my kids would have more fun learning if they could get to the piano before the studying gets too dull.Still, a good tool.

A superb compilation of the A & B sides from every single released by the Specials, STEREO-TYPICAL is a a great collection for anyone who loved the band, Ska, or the semi-underground club scene in which both flourished during the late 1970s and early 1980s.Beyond making black & white both a fashion statement and a social comment, Ska, much more than Punk, was able to crack radio playlists on both sides of the Atlantic, allowing in a breath of fresh air after years of increasingly stale corporate Rock and Pop. It seemed fresh and new, yet had its roots in R&B; and traditional reggae. On the dance floor Ska was hip with roots, if you follow me.The Specials were witty, fun, fashionable, bright, had a great horn section, brains and a social conscience. Within the genre they couldn't be touched, and they sound as great now as they did in their glory days.

It simply isn't Christmas until I hear the beautiful vocal version of &quot;Christmas Time Is Here.&quot;My 8-year old and I share one minor complaint about the CD: where are Schroeder's multiple attempts at &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; ending with his single-finger pounded version?&quot;Whaddya mean, Beethoven wasn't so great?!?&quot;

I'm a prolific reader and there are only a handful of books I've started and not bothered to finish. "Holy Cow" is one of them.MacDonald spends a lot of time describing how awful she found India, how little she thinks of Hinduism, and how WONDERFUL her WONDERFUL career in WONDERFUL Australia was (who outside of Australia has ever heard of her or her WONDERFUL work on Australian radio?) -- but mostly what she does is whine about how nothing on earth meets her rather adolescent standards.I gave up after 100 pages of her tedious complaining.

I've heard all the praise of Big Star for years but never came across their LPs in any record store. Now that I bought their CD I can't figure out what all the hype is about.There must be something I'm missing, because this sounds like a pretty pedestrian imitation of a Steve Marriott record. I've always heard the songwriting on Big Star records was great, but short-sighted ditties like "The India Song" leave me wondering if I'm listening to the same record as those reviewers.Big Star left me completely underwhelmed.

This CD would be a great indroductory piece for anyone interested in Sitar/subcontinental music. The production is clear as a bell--I've been disapointed with the production on some Ravi Shankar records--and the ragas are not the 35-minute monoliths so popular on Indian records 1968-1980s. Don't get me wrong, I love Ravi's records and the full-length Indian-classical stuff. But, if you aren't sure if the music is for you, here's a great starting point.

I'm never going to slam the Who or Pete Townshend, but I have some serious questions about this &quot;very best of&quot; package.I don't much care for &quot;greatest hits&quot; and &quot;best of&quot; projects in any case, and the Who, as much as any band, should be heard in their original formats. &quot;Love Reign O'er Me,&quot; is a great Rock record; heard in the context of the original QUADROPHENIA it is a near-spiritual experience.And, like all &quot;best of&quot; records, somebody with little understanding of the band seems to have selected the running order. I can understand the first eleven selections, but then &quot;The Seeker&quot; pops up it's rather mundane little head. This may have been an important philosphical turning point for Pete, but the tune itself--and the thematically related &quot;Let's See Action&quot;--have never excited me.There's only one song from the band's greatest LP, QUADREPHENIA, and I suppose it only made it because it had a second life when the film was released. &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; is the fluffiest hit the band ever had--and who really wants a banjo solo on a Who greatest hits album?--and the inclusion of &quot;You Better You Bet&quot; only serves to illustrate how quickly the band faded after Keith Moon died and Pete Townshend dove into the brandy bottle.There are plenty of great tunes here to initiate the young, but buy the original albums if at all possible. The Who were the greatest Rock group of all time, and you should hear them the way they meant to be heard.

I don't suppose I can realistically argue that WHO BY NUMBERS is the best Who LP. It's really not on the same level as QUADROPHENIA, WHO'S NEXT or LIVE AT LEEDS.But WHO BY NUMBERS may be my favorite Who LP. It's Townshends most personal, most initmate group effort. While it has never made me want to hold a lighter over my head or play air guitar, it does touch me in a way no other Who record can do.Critics love to say the album was Townshend's first 'mid-life crisis' LP. That's more than a tad absurd, considering Townshend was still a good 15 years shy of mid-life. WHO BY NUMBERS has more to do with Townshend's increasing concern that he was losing himself in drink and celebrity. The album is a cry for intimacy in a world Townshend increasingly saw as hollow and transparent; he finds himself, as he wrote years earlier, Alone In A Crowd. The audience and the generation that Townshend always tried so hard to connect with seemed to be further removed from him all the time. On &quot;However Much I Booze&quot; he sings:&quot;You at home can easily decide what's right by glancing very breifly at the songs I write, but it don't help me that you know, there still ain't no way out.&quot;For all the talk of Townshend's bow to Punk on WHO ARE YOU and his great solo LP EMPTY GLASS, he seems to have had a premonition of the movement on this 1975 album, writing in &quot;They Are All In Love&quot;:&quot;Goodbye all you punks, stay young and stay high. Hand me checkbook and I'll crawl off to die. Like a woman in childbirth, grown ugly in a flash, I've seen magic and pain, now I'm recycling trash.&quot;The songs on WHO BY NUMBERS are witty, caustic, confessional, and, in several cases--&quot;They Are All In Love,&quot; &quot;Blue Red And Grey&quot;--downright pretty. There are two quirky little hits here, &quot;Slip Kid&quot; and &quot;Squeeze Box,&quot; but the non-hits, including Entwistle's great &quot;Success Story,&quot; are far better.

Ignore the absolutely horrible film based on this record, forget that Christ is sung by the lead singer from Deep Purple and Mary Magdelane sung by a woman who's next American hit came off SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, and forget the mountain of tripe Andrew Lloyd Webber has forced on the human race in the last 20 years: JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is a great LP.It is dramatic in a way Webber never again touched. Of course, working with a story most of the western world knows backwards and forwards, it's easy enough to inject forshadowing, but the ominous feeling hanging over so much of this LP gives every tune an edge that you feel to your bones.Yvonne Elliman is angelic on &quot;Everything's Alright&quot; and &quot;I Don't Know How To Love Him,&quot; Victor Brox and Barry Dennen demonic on &quot;This Jesus Must Die,&quot; Mide D'Abo is downright McCartney-esque on &quot;Try It And See,&quot; and Ian Gillan rocks in a way Broadway has never seen.And the tunes are really good. Even the instrumental portions--many of which were swiped by advertisers (the intro to &quot;Simon Zealotes,&quot; for instance) for years--are unforgettable.Will this LP open spiritual doors? I dunno. Buy it for the music. Leave the rest to...well, whoever you leave that sort of thing to.

I think Rock & Roll misses Joe Strummer a lot more than any of us ever dreamed possible. He could be awful corny, in a Working Class Hero kind of way, and he sure didn't have the prettiest voice--but, between him and John Lennon, Rock and Pop had two great hearts.There's something odd about Joe singing Marley's "Redemption Song," but who did more to bring Reggae to England and America? For me and a lot of other kids in the 70s and 80s--and with apologies to Clapton's "I Shot The Sheriff" and the old version of "Israelites" that charted in the States--it was Ska and the Clash that made Reggae beats real. That made North America's discovery of Marley and appreciation of Reggae complete. There's enough heart and soul in Strummer's voice to overcome the Rich White Boy Singing Poor Black Music goofiness inherant in this record."Arms Aloft" is a pretty good song; it could have fit into the GIVE'EM ENOUGH ROPE-era Clash sound. I've never had much use for Strummer sans Mick Jones, but this is a step up from the disastrous CUT THE CRAP LP Strummer put out under the Clash moniker or almost anything else he did post-Clash. The 1/3-speed version of "Armagideon Time" that closes out this CD proves my point. Everything from the original version is included--except the passion and the energy. And without passion and energy, the Clash was....what? Haircut 100?Who else could have sang "This is Joe Public...SPEAKING!" and made it sound so real, so true, so righteous--so RIGHT ON--and had cynics like me believing it? I miss that kind of ass-kicking hope and belief in Rock.And I think Rock misses Strummer--and Lennon, and Marley, and a lot of others--more than it is ever willing to admit. Rock--or the Rock Establishment, as exemplified by MTV and Rolling Stone magazine--likes to pretend that The Strokes and The White Stripes and a bunch of others are filling the gaps. They are good bands, but they also waste way too much time and energy posing and primping with no heart or soul involved. Posthumous releases like this are fine, though they point out all too clearly the inadequacies of today's batch of soon-to-be-has-beens.

Like an awful lot of people I was a J5 fan for a couple years in my youth and then got fed up with the MJ show. I mean, I loved the moondance on the Motown reunion show, but that was, what--20 years ago? And do we really need a man who collects llamas and is in some kind of contest with Liz Taylor to see who can rack up the largest plastic surgery bills telling us to look in the mirror and save the world?You know all the early stuff that's on here, and it's all as great as you remember. Unlike the Osmonds and the pseudo-group Partridges, who they were often compared to in their early days, the J5 were great singers, laid down funky tracks and, when all was said and done, were lightyears ahead of their lightweight contemporaries.The shocker here, to me, is the 1995 remix of &quot;It's Your Thing,&quot; using MJ's vocal and little else from the original version. It's dirty and thumping and grinding fun. Hot stuff.

This is just a blistering set of great, great singles.Diana Ross & The Supremes could make anything sound good--"When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through Your Eyes" is just as bad as it's clunky title indicates--so when they were given good material, which they generally were, they made fantastic records.Of course, having the Motown rhythm machine behind them didn't hurt a bit. Songs like "Come See About Me" could have been fluffed by lesser players, but they throb and ache, drums and bass pulsing, horns and vibes pushing, the whole thing as tight as a drum.Ross, who has received a pile of unwarrented criticism in recent years, was thE female voice of the 1960s. She is flawless on "Stop! In The Name Of Love," "My World Is Empty Without You," and "Reflections."And, of course, there are the Supreme's two moments of immortality, "I Hear A Symphony" and "Someday We'll Be Together," two pieces of Pop so perfect they give me chills. If Diana Ross & The Supremes had released only those two sides, they would rank high in the pantheon. "Someday We'll Be Together" is an absolute classic, a song and a performance so magic that I just lose all sense of vocabulary trying to describe it. It is heaven.

What posessed me to buy this CD? What on earth was I thinking?I don't know, frankly, but I'm glad I did. While it doesn't tell a story the way it's genre-mate, the soundtrack to Ken Burn's Civil War, did, it does set a time and a place effectively.The few vocal tracks are a little hard to stomach. I understand the history of the music just fine, but I still think the aural picture of modern day white men singing in this manner is more akin to performing in blackface than they may realize. There is no intent to mock or insult in this recording, but there is still something a bit odd about a 21st Century white man from a gentrified area of Virginia singing &quot;I thought she was g'wanna kiss me when she took and pulled my nose&quot; in some...uh...rural accent.Call me picky.Still, I like the CD. Recording it is important, listening to it is enjoyable.

This is, without a doubt, the best 'Greatest Hits/Best Of' package ever assembled. Not too tough a job, I suppose, since Berry wrote so many great tunes.***Warning: Sacreligious Statement To Follow This Warning***I do not consider Elvis the King of Rock & Roll--to me, Chuck Berry will always be The King.The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Springsteen, even Ray Charles and a thousand others all covered Berry songs.Beyond the throbbing rhythns and that great hollowbody guitar, there are the lyrics, some of the best, most-American poetry you'll ever read. Berry was citified country, and he wrote like it. An absolute genious.I saw him live about 10 or 12 years ago. That would be more that 25 years past his prime, and 15 years after his one and only number 1 single (a fact that I find completely mind-blowing). He was awesome, playing those loose, but never sloppy, leads like it was 1957.Hail To The King! RE-RELEASE THIS CD!

Single Gun Theory may have come out of Australia, but their sound has some basis in Indian/Pakistani Bhangra music, which was gaining some UK exposure about the time this wonderful CD was released.This is the direction sampling should have gone: as added color to already formed songs, rather than the flat-out plagerism heard too often today.&quot;From A Million Miles,&quot; &quot;Words Written Backwords,&quot; and &quot;Angels Over Teheren&quot; are all top-flight dance hall tunes, great examples of the convergance of techno and world-music that, while never too popular in the States, controlled international music for two decades.

I wrote a review of this book a few weeks ago and it was never posted. I guess I was so harsh the censor trashed it. That in itself should indicate clearly how little I think of this book.I'd give &quot;Behind Sad Eyes&quot; a negative 4 rating if it were allowed.Beyond the odd title--everyone I've mentioned it too assumed it was a book about Pete Townshend--the book is just slapped together. It is filled with factual inaccuracies, it is poorly written and, frankly, it is boring.'Nuff said.

When he's good he's really, really good; but when he's bad he's boring as all get out.There was a time--it's hard to recall now, but I swear this is true--there was a time when Prince was on a plane with Michael Jackson and Madonna, artistically, creatively, and commercially. But at some point, somewhere around the time he went through all that silliness about using a self-created rune in place of the name moniker which he'd already used to replace his given name, the commercial bottom dropped out. His creative fires have cooled a bit in recent years too, though I would argue that he's a better musician and more of an artist than Madonna has been or MJ could even dream of being.I would also argue that this is NOT a &quot;Best of&quot; package, as it claims to be, but a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package. There is a difference.
